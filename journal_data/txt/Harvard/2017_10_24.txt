After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a single viewing, Echosmith’s premiere video from their new EP “Inside a Dream” may look like a nearly four-minute, multi-product ad with mediocre background music. In addition to evoking strong creeper-van-kidnapper vibes, the track title “Get Into My Car” also calls to mind Billy Ocean’s 1988 single “Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car,” confirming this writer’s long-held suspicion that every installment of contemporary pop culture has a superior 80’s precursor.
The video features lead vocalist Sydney Sierota playing an Uber driver, though her opening admission that she’s been “driving all night” and “burning through lights” does not inspire confidence in potential passengers. Really, how Sierota obtained the driver ratings necessary to continue representing Uber defies imagination. The only conceivable explanation is a theoretical, highly persuasive letter of recommendation from the laboring woman that Sierota helped to the hospital. In either case, there’s nothing for Echosmith to worry about if the Uber career doesn’t pan out, as the band is also repping at least two other brands, including Fiat, McDonalds, and maybe even iPhone.

At least one passenger must not have been bothered by Sierota’s traffic violations, because he obsessively tracks the singer’s route on his app (not creepy at all) in order to orchestrate a second ride, probably helping boost her ratings in the process. The aforementioned passenger may be played by Sierota’s boyfriend Cameron Quiseng, who is shown sporting black pants, a long-sleeved white button down, and a tie, but in the context of the video, the most remarkable things about him are his tendency to cross paths with Sierota and suspicious lack of a suit coat. By the fourth ride, Sierota comes to Quiseng’s house expecting to pick him up as usual, but is surprised to be pulled inside for a romantic indoor picnic at the bachelor pad. She conveniently happens to be wearing thigh-high boots and a velvet minidress for the occasion. Be careful not to pause the video during the final scene, or a still of Sierota’s McCafe—label perfectly aligned—may cause you to forget that the focus of this video is actually its music.
All that aside, once you give the video a chance (read: watch it seven more times), these miniscule criticisms begin to lose their potency and Echosmith’s attempt at a serious social critique takes center stage. Perhaps the song’s sketchy title is warranted, as the car in question does drive for Uber, a company that has repeatedly come under fire for its questionable ethics in recent months. In an interesting reversal of Uber’s infamous “Greyball” tool, which allows the company to evade local authorities who try to hail rides, Echosmith’s video depicts the passenger played by Quiseng turning the tables and using the company’s technology to track his driver, Sierota. (What other explanation could there possibly be for the actors’ incessant use of the Uber mobile app?) In doing so, Echosmith suggests that Uber drivers are also affected by the company’s habit of skirting of the law, a fact that’s all too real, according to the drivers who filed a class action lawsuit against the company. In fact, by the end of the video, Echosmith has succeeded in transforming Quiseng into the Uber empire personified. He forces himself into Sierota’s life just like Uber forced itself into the ride-hailing market—with no permission and little regard for the status quo.
Unfortunately for Uber, its attempt to recruit Echosmith into its ranks seems to have backfired. Fooled by the presence of other products in “Get Into My Car,” Uber failed to realize these were included with the sole purpose of providing a distraction (and probably lining Echosmith’s pockets in the process). Sorry, McDonalds and Fiat. You, too, have been played by Echosmith.
But chastising Uber came at a price. Echosmith had to sacrifice their song in order to do so. Reminiscent of Phillip Phillips’ “Home,” which will forever be associated with American Family Insurance, it’s now impossible to listen to “Get Into My Car” without picturing a strange combination of the Uber logo and the golden arches. The innocence of the video’s trope—passenger serendipitously falls in love with driver—results in a song that is unable to withstand the blatant, excessive product placement to which Echosmith subjects it. While the band’s underlying message is admirable, it’s so subtle that without the proper focus, you may finish the video and believe that you’ve been watching a cheesy ad montage all along.

“On Comedy” is an eight-part, weekly series for the Crimson’s blog. In it, I’ll be using relatively recently released comedy specials—all can currently be accessed on Netflix—as a medium to discuss various aspects of stand-up comedy that are of interest to me. These are not reviews, although my position on each comic will be clear by the end of each week. If this interests you, dear reader, please read on.
If I may provide a disclaimer, the series is written in a mildly satiric voice—both self-satire and a satire of the voice of a critic. However, the series itself is not satire. The following pieces are—I hope—more illuminating than obfuscating and more thought-provoking than tiresome. But perhaps, if one is to take a lesson from the generations of failed comics that made modern comedy possible, we don’t always get what we hope for.
This week, I would like to talk about Norm Macdonald. He is a particularly wonderful comic; his recent special, “Hitler's Dog, Gossip, and Trickery,” is shockingly brilliant. In the coming weeks, I will be discussing Katherine Ryan, Iliza Shlesinger, and Sarah Silverman (covered in weeks three, four, and eight respectively).
Macdonald does not have the overt ambition of Maria Bamford (covered in week five), nor does he have the cool charm of Deon Cole (week two) and, to a certain degree, Hasan Minhaj (weeks six and seven). But listen closely—underneath his intoxicated-sounding voice (he doesn’t drink) and thrown-together set list is the mind of a genius.
Many comedians, I believe, are restrained by a certain guiding principle concerning their approach towards an hour-long set: Their hour must cohere. Jokes are composed to flow from one line to the next, transitioning smoothly and—hopefully—illuminating something about the previous bit through their juxtaposition. Sets have overarching themes, cohesive ideas that link jokes together. Some sets will be kind enough to leave the audience with a moral or a principal philosophical tenet that the audience can take home and share with their family and friends.
Macdonald’s special is an exercise in subverting cohesion. Transitions are rare and bizarre. There is no moral. His self-stated central themes are “gossip and trickery”—themes that have little explicit bearing on the special (more on this later). His subversion of those standards of modern comedy, however, is subtly ambitious. He is not breaking the rules to shove his subversion in your face—à la Bamford—he is breaking the rules to allow the simplest pleasures of his comedy to shine.
“It’s very, very hard, not lying. Because you want people to like you—you know what I mean. All kinds of reasons to lie. I’ve thought of a way of not lying, and I’ll tell it to you. You can tell the truth, word for word—absolutely true—but when you do it, you use a sarcastic accent. So I’ll give you an example. So at dinner your wife goes, ‘I saw at dinner you were looking at my sister. You’re not attracted to my sister.’ And then you say, ‘Oh yes, I’m attracted to your sister.’”
The joke devolves from there (“devolves” is meant in the best sense of the word). There is a certain wonderful simplicity to the bit: It’s simply repurposing a sarcastic voice. That’s the heart of Macdonald’s creativity. He rejects the ostentatious in favor of brilliantly refashioning a simple concept: sarcasm and lies. He’s the comedic equivalent of a chef paring down the complexity of ingredients on his menu to allow the products of spring to sing. It is a blindingly modern approach.
With that said, kind reader, it is a bit comic how he frames his work. “Nothing of what I’ve said is of substance,” he tells us. “Most of my act is just gossip and trickery.” Perhaps the modest artist should never be taken at his word. Even his silliest bits—one of his opening jokes is about suffocation from autoerotic asphyxiation—are deeply sensitive meditations on death and parent-child relationships. I do not know if Macdonald is even aware of some of the subtle layers in his comedy. Or, for that matter, if he would approve of this piece of criticism. He’s just telling jokes. But there is a subtle depth of brilliance to his bits that should be recognized, intentional or not. (Tangentially, I tend to believe that Macdonald is, at least, subconsciously aware of the depth of brilliance in his comedy. His title is but a piece of false modesty.)
There’s a certain aspirational wonder in this. His jokes don’t require overbearing setups and pyrotechnics (no offense intended towards Kevin Hart’s “Let Me Explain”). Macdonald’s comedy is drawn from the implicit impact of personal experience—it is grounded in the nature of human interaction, human interaction that one must have to formulate the ethos of Macdonald’s jokes—but it is not explicitly personal. It’s not derived from specific stories about an unattainably interesting life (again, none intended towards Hart—he is brilliant in his own right). Thus each of us, in the right moment, and with the right creative inspiration, could create what Macdonald has wrought.
Witnessing the creation of comic genius, fashioned from so few ingredients, gives—if I may say it—hope. Hope that one day, perhaps, I’ll have a singular idea that approximates the brilliance of what Macdonald has in some moments in his special. (I hope to be modest: I know that the day has not come.) Witnessing Macdonald gives one hope that the potentiality of creation is within each of our souls. It gives us enough hope, dear reader, to dream.
That is, perhaps, the highest form of comedy: The kind of comedy that reminds us of what we can be.

Takashi Murakami is not just an artist—he’s an entrepreneur with his own business, collaborating with artists like Kanye West and brands like Louis Vuitton. His distinct aesthetic has received global acclaim, and underpinning all his work is a strong belief that Japanese art is still as dynamic as ever. “Takashi Murakami: Lineage of Eccentrics,” at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston until April 1, is a unique look into Murakami’s work and inspiration. The exhibition, in collaboration with renowned Japanese art historian and Murakami’s personal mentor, Nobuo Tsuji, presents works from Murakami’s career next to pieces from the MFA’s collection of premodern Japanese art. While Murakami has drawn from traditional sources and is informed by Tsuji’s mentorship, Murakami’s aesthetic is largely his own innovative combination of cute and scary.
The exhibition opens with a vibrant and comic-like painted canvas. A tribute to Nobuo Tsuji for his impact on Murakami’s career, “Transcendent Attacking a Whirlwind” is a never-before-seen preview of the artwork to follow. The work exemplifies Murakami’s Superflat movement, which places images on a completely two-dimensional plane. The playful treatment of color and the distorted facial features are signature Murakami, and the whirlwind motif hints at the art’s traditional Japanese roots. It is a colorful interpretation of “Transcendent Attacking a Whirlwind” by Soga Shōhaku, a late 18th century artist from whom Murakami has continuously drawn inspiration.
Perhaps Murakami’s most famous iconography, the bunny-like monsters in “Lots, Lots of Kaikai and Kiki” best demonstrate the artist’s reconciliation of the dark and “asobi,” the concept of “playfulness” found in many strains of contemporary Japanese art. Kaikai, circular faces with rabbit ears, and Kiki, a character based on Murakami’s interaction with an intellectually challenged child, derive from “kaikaikiki,” meaning “dangerous yet appealing.” The term originally described the style of the 16th century painter Kano Eitoku, and it inspired Murakami so much that it is the name of his company. The two-teethed, smiling (or screaming) creatures are set on the same smiling poppies that star in the stained glass “Flower Lamps” and the gold canvas of “Kawaii-Vacances: Summer Vacation in the Kingdom of the Golden.” They’re cute, but almost shouldn’t be: The colors evoke a sense of pure childishness, but the faces themselves are deranged and disfigured. Murakami capitalizes on this tension as if to say that they should coexist in order to fully appreciate both qualities.
To address Japan’s religious history and evolution, Murakami drew from the MFA’s own “Shaka, the Historical Buddha.” Because he believes that religion must drastically change to appeal to new generations, his works offer what he calls his “non-denominational prayers.” In “Oval Buddha Silver,” his buddha sculpture has two faces: One has its eyes closed as if in meditation, while the other has an enlarged, open mouth that reveals a set of sharp teeth. With religion changes deities must also mutate, so the figure is not perfectly proportional like traditional depictions of the Buddha; instead, it has a head far too large for its thin body. The entire sculpture is sterling silver, acknowledging the sanctity of not only the Buddha but also the traditions that surround him. He also stands on a lotus pedestal, a traditional Buddhist motif that also appears in “Shaka,” on top of a figure reminiscent of the demonic figures that sometimes accompanied Buddhist deities. Again, the figure could be cute, but Murakami quickly contrasts that potential with a ferocious side. In the context of Buddhism, this duality could suggest the serenity of desired enlightenment and the zealous efforts required to achieve it.
The exhibition ends on a note as grand as its beginning. “Dragon in Clouds—Red Mutation” (or “The version I painted myself in annoyance after the Professor Nobuo Tsuji told me, ‘Why don’t you paint something yourself for once?’”) is Murakami’s direct interpretation of Shōhaku’s “Dragon in Clouds,” originally sliding door paintings now on eight panels. He painted the entire work in 24 hours. At almost 60 feet wide, the painting is an explosion of red across a white canvas. When viewed from right to left, one first sees a hint of a thin, scaly tail, then the body, and finally the head of the dragon itself. In comparison to the original, the dragon is fiercer with teeth-like nose hairs and crazed eyes. That does not necessarily mean a sense of danger—if anything, there is something entrancing about the bewilderment in his eyes, suggesting that he is not as scary as he initially appears.
Traditional Japanese art through the lens of Murakami is captivating, challenging, and eccentric. He has succeeded in capturing the vivacity and timelessness of Japanese art in a way that’s uniquely his own, a refreshing take on universal dualities.

Richard F. Thomas, the George Martin Lane Professor of the Classics at Harvard, is scheduled to release his new book, “Why Bob Dylan Matters,” on November 21. Thomas has taught a freshman seminar about Bob Dylan and classical poets every four years since 2004, and most recently, in the fall of 2016, when Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Thomas has published an article in 2007 about the relation between Dylan and the classical poets, “The Streets of Rome: Classical Dylan,” in the journal Oral Tradition. Thomas’s book builds on some of the connections he established in his earlier article, but also—he hopes—extends the concept to the modern day, arguing for Dylan’s relevance in modern music and literature. Thomas sat down with The Harvard Crimson to talk more about the upcoming release.
The Harvard Crimson: Tell us a bit about your book.
Richard F. Thomas: The book is about the lyrics, the way in which Dylan is the genius of my lifetime—with musical poetry, if you like, however we define his art. The book is about how he comes into alignment with a lot of the poets that I work on from antiquity, but also in the English literary traditions, and the ways in the past twenty years he’s adopted these texts and put them into his lyrics, bringing other contexts, other characters, into the songs, so the singer has transformed in the process. That puts Dylan’s art in a long tradition that goes back to the field that I’ve studied for a long time.
THC: What was the inspiration for the book?
RFT: I’ve been thinking about doing a Dylan book for some time, but really it was doing this freshman seminar, which I do every four years, and doing it on the day of the Nobel Prize. When I was approached about the book, no topic was prescribed, and I wasn’t sure what the structure would be when I began. But it developed over the months as I was writing it, it’s about Dylan’s song and Dylan’s writing … There’s something about his music which gets into your head, and his lyrics are above all about what it means to be a human being—successes, failures, losses, and gains—we all have these in our lives, and music captures it.
THC: Did you grow up listening to Dylan? You describe this a little bit in the book when talking about Bob Dylan in New Zealand, but was he a major part of your life growing up?
RFT: Very much so. In those days, everybody listened to the same music. There were music stores. There wasn’t online music. There were indie groups, but they were very local. Essentially, at my school, as I write, we sang “Blowin' in the Wind” when I was 14, and I was listening to the music of the ’60s, pop music, and his was a voice that was obviously there from the beginning. It’s really what he did to music from ’64 to ’66 that transformed pop music and folk music and created a new genre.
THC: How did the idea come to you? Was there an a-ha moment, or anything like that?
RFT: I started making the connection in the ’70s, and probably with the album “Blood on the Tracks,” which is an album about divorce, about reflection on the past which is gone. So a lot of past tenses in the songs mirror past relationships where memory is very much alive. This is not so much Virgil but more the poet Catullus, who was a lyric poet, and that is where I started seeing that album in particular, in early 1975. You can also see that particular voice in the earlier music, so that was a loose connection. The tight connection really came with the albums in 2001, when he started quoting not just a couple of lines of Virgil but also “Huck Finn” and other novels—his art started looking very much like the art of Virgil and Ovid, who are embedding prior tradition into their songs. That’s when he starts functioning like a pre-Romantic poet—Milton with the Bible and Virgil in Paradise Lost.
THC: Dylan was playing the role of a traveling bard, retelling stories by word of mouth—he seems to adapt the stories to a new audience in the same way the poets might.
RFT: I think that’s true, and I think that’s part of how folk works. We have ancient harvest songs whose stylizations turn up in the poems, and what gets lost is folk culture and song. Humans have always sung about their problems and joys, and that tradition is going on under the surface. A song like “Barbara Allen” we happen to know because Samuel Pepys mentions in his diary—it’s why the Lomaxes were collecting and taping Appalachian and other folk music and preserving it. I think Dylan sees himself as part of that tradition, but he also says you start off with an idea and see where it goes. He’s not giving us a retelling of the classics, but he’s assuming the voice of some of those characters, and he’ll mingle it with some other characters. Dylan likes those incongruities and weird juxtapositions.
THC: In your introduction, you argue that Dylan has a lot of important things to say about the study of the humanities. What do you think your book has to say about the study of the humanities?
RFT: His art presents in aesthetically compelling ways what it means to be a human. The word humanities, humanitas in Latin, it means a number of things, but chiefly it means the fact that we’re all humans. It’s an attitude we have towards all human beings, because they are humans, and the humanities is a set of disciplines that reminds us what it means to be human through art.

Brutally honest and often harrowing, Ta-Nehisi Coates’s new book “We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy” speaks to the division gripping our nation today. A collection of eight articles, one written each year of the Obama administration, the book pairs the excitement and optimism of the period in which it was written with the harsher reality of the last few months. The novel is a candid, pragmatic retrospective of the last decade, detailing both what the Obama administration did for the country, and what the aftermath is now that it has ended.
Coates’s collection, for all its criticism and analysis, is most compelling because it is grounded in his own experiences. Though his essays for “The Atlantic” span a wide variety of topics, the author’s commentary on his own life provides a meta-view which elucidates the motivation behind his work. Detailing the parallel developments of the 2008 election and his own burgeoning success, Coates reflects that, “The lock was changed. The doors swung open, and we did not know how to act.” An intimate look not only at the sociopolitical climate of the country, but also at the journalist’s experiences, these musings help to humanize the man behind the keyboard and to emphasize that, agree or disagree with his argument, one cannot question the sincerity of his account of the past eight years.
The book walks an interesting line: It is fiercely political while only peripherally discussing politics. Coates tackles his analysis of the past eight years by selecting a broad spectrum of pieces, spanning topics as diverse as Civil War education, the neighborhood dynamics on the South Side of Chicago, and economic reparations. Politics, it soon becomes evident, is inseparable from everyday life, and the book effectively explores the power structures underlying race relations in the United States without coming off as punditry.
Although there are moments of subjectivity, Coates never abandons his position as a fair judge of the situation unfolding around him. Take his assessment of former President Obama as an example: Coates calls the man “a skilled politician, a deeply moral human being, and one of the greatest presidents in American history,” but also acknowledges that years of compromise in office shifted focus off of “the nightmare endured by the minority.” Coates neither passes judgment nor absolves the president of the necessities of his job; rather, he lays out the facts and recognizes that even political necessities must be given proper skepticism. The rest of his writing follows suit, addressing facts and extrapolating as fairly as possible.
Coates makes it clear that the purpose of his piece is not to find solutions. He writes that “the title ‘public intellectual’ had been attached to me, and I saw what came with it was not just the air of the dilettante but the air of the solutionist.” Coates does not aim to create actionable steps towards resistance, instead abdicating authority in favor of simply instigating discussion. This way of understanding his role as a journalist is what gives the novel its potential staying power: It is less a hot take on the current political climate and more a deliberate attempt to start dialogue.
At its core, the work teaches its readers caution. Coates never quite reaches the point of resignation, but he is a realist about the social atmosphere of the United States. His novel serves to remind future generations that history is never linear, and that even watershed moments are temporary and only maintained with vigilance.
And so, though it wrestles with salient current events, “We Were Eight Years in Power” remains cognizant of the larger narrative of American history. The book has a deeply introspective understanding of its position in history, not as a single thread which alters the trajectory of the nation, but rather as one voice in a larger tapestry of progress. Coates’s final words, “I see the fight against sexism, racism, poverty, and even war finding their union not in synonymity but in their ultimate goal—a world more humane,” are a rallying cry which unites rather than divides, instructs rather than inveighs. His recollection of the past eight years is a demonstration both of how much the world can change in so little time and how important it is to have a broader view in mind.

In 1903, in the town of Great Wyrley, England, 27-year-old George Edalji was charged with severe animal mutilation. Up until then, Edalji was an upstanding citizen — the son of a vicar and a successful solicitor in his own right. But Edalji’s family had long faced discrimination for their Parsee—or Persian—heritage. The police received anonymous letters accusing George of the crimes. When a pony was found with its stomach slit open, they went in for the arrest. Officers found George’s clothing covered with mud, blood, and horse hair. The year was 1903, and that was evidence enough for the law. It was not enough for George. So he sent a letter to his favorite mystery author asking for help—and incredibly, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle took the case.
Rarely has a character revolutionized a genre the way Sherlock Holmes did the mystery. Of course George Edalji wrote to Conan Doyle; who else knew how to catch a bank robber by the dirt on his pants, or a gem thief by his goose-selling habits? October 2017 marks the 125th anniversary of the first Holmes novel, “A Study in Scarlet”—and since then, the word “mystery” has invariably evoked Sherlock Holmes. But Edalji was onto something when he enlisted Conan Doyle in his real-life crime case. Sherlock Holmes crossed the border between real life and fiction with a persuasiveness that changed the relationship between author and audience. “A Study in Scarlet” was something new for the world of mysteries—but it was also something new for the world in general.
For his part, Conan Doyle never planned for his stories to explode as they did. The author was a serious man — Sherlock Holmes was child’s play. But for Conan Doyle’s audiences, Holmes was a character they could claim for themselves. “A Study in Scarlet” was first published in “Beeton’s Christmas Annual,” an English magazine, in 1887. By 1893, when Conan Doyle pushed Holmes off a cliff, the mysteries’ influence was great enough that 20,000 Strand magazine subscribers cancelled their subscriptions. Today, such fervor is normalized: Being a “fan” is an identity, and liking something often has elements of culture and community. But when Sherlock Holmes was new, such passion was almost unheard of. Fans protested in the streets and wrote their own endings. Even J.M. Barrie—the author of “Peter Pan” and a personal friend of Conan Doyle—wrote a Sherlock Holmes piece of his own. An especially dramatic subset of Sherlock adherents claimed that Conan Doyle was just the literary agent for the “real” Holmes and Watson.
By having such little regard for his own characters, Conan Doyle inadvertently shifted the dynamic between author, audience, and artwork. His audiences felt so strong an affinity for his stories that the author’s own intentions ceased to matter. This wasn’t about Conan Doyle, the person. This was about Sherlock Holmes. The character was so ubiquitous that he became the standard to which all subsequent mysteries were compared. Holmes and Watson are the original clinical-genius-with-friendly-sidekick pair. The archetype is so powerful that it is hard to know when an adaptation is an allusion to Conan Doyle, and when it is just something created post-Holmes. The BBC show “Sherlock” is an explicit riff on the original stories, for example, but what about the medical drama “House” (with remarkably similar characters), or the mystery-comedy “Psych” (with a remarkably similar conceit)? The prototype is Conan Doyle’s. Everything that comes later has Holmes to thank.
Conan Doyle might be gratified to know that his work had such influence within his genre. But as a trained doctor, he might be even happier to hear about the real science that his writing influenced. Conan Doyle brought science to mystery writing—and the result was both captivating for audiences and inspirational for real-life detectives. Sherlock Holmes was the first to use ballistics, including bullet trajectory, as evidence in a criminal case. He used scientific methods to analyze blood spatters and deduce poisonings. The first real forensics lab was built in 1910, 23 years after Conan Doyle built the first fictional one. If Conan Doyle had an astounding influence on the mystery genre and the concept of a “fan,” he had almost as much on real detectives. He became a powerful figure in criminal justice—making him an obvious person to turn to if, say, you were accused of animal mutilation in a small English village.

The cars move so fast and uniform almostas if an invisible bloodline strings through their wheelsand slips the whole industrial necklace forward,air beaded between glass and metal.
On the way to Allston, we changed tiresonly because the old ones were cloggedwith ambrosial gasoline, and we couldn’t drinkenough to replace the taste of cheap wine.
We were spirits hanging over chimneysor suburban roofs, gazing over the sharp wingedleaves attempting flight from the trees, lurchingtheir beautiful golden bellies in the bright wind.
We unraveled butterflies in the deep night,trawled farms streaked with low heat and crawlingwith dirt and worms of sweat spinning downforeheads. We called the work idyllic,
because it required no destination. Onlythe ability to stay static long enough to remainon a patch of grass, treading above a graveyardsubsumed beneath our feet.
There are so many things I haven’t told you,yet, the way your horse slopes low over the valleyand rolls like an untethered bead down and down.Then it quenches the lake.

“Satire Night Live” foreshadows with the title’s pun. A collaboration between Satire V and On Harvard Time, directed by Grace C. Ramsey ’19 and head written by Cat Zhang ’19, the comedy show presented a series of ten sketches. Aided by—and dependent upon—the participation of an exuberant crowd, the comedians of “Satire Night Live” had no trouble cleverly mocking everything Harvard-related, from The Crimson to “politically correct” culture.
Entering the Adams Pool Theater to the pure timbre of “The Hills are Alive” was cathartic, in a way serving to cleanse the audience of any preconceptions regarding the show’s content. In a satirical production with contentious content, the creators’ utilization of this running “Sound of Music” theme served as a base that perhaps the entire room could identify and understand.
This may or may not be ascribing undue significance to these references. Perhaps one of the producers is just obsessed with Julie Andrews. Even so, those seated for the program now know that if the imminent sketches won’t make them laugh, at least they can give the creators credit for good taste in music.
The show’s simple set gave focus to the content of the skits. The use of only bare necessities put both the actors and the script in the spotlight, with most of the sketches featuring just a table and green chairs. The bareness of the stage highlighted the witty humor and animated performances but also stated loudly and clearly that this was a comedy show, and a comedy show was what the audience would get. Notably, the only times props serviced the sketches were when the the object was made a character. For instance, in the opening sketch “Helicopter Parents,” written by Zhang, the parents were literally the begetters of a toy helicopter.
Following this adorable introduction, the content progressively increased in gravity. A good number of sketches pointed out Harvard’s institutional flaws as well as some of its students’ twisted logic that most rarely, if ever, stop to recognize. “Rejection Clinic,” written by Savannah I. Whaley ’18, mocks the culture of rejection from various selective organizations on campus but simultaneously outs many for thinking that attending Harvard places them on a pedestal.
PC culture is a touchy subject about touchy subjects. However, this Satire V / On Harvard Time collaboration found a way to remove the tensions surrounding the topic in a way that was not just amusing, but absolutely hilarious. In a rousing finish, Emily B. Zauzmer ’18’s “Section of Music” brought the Julie Andrews allusion full circle with an admirably ridiculous adaptation of “Do Re Mi.” The sketch poked fun at the great detail that goes into political correctness, teasing students’ exaggerated efforts to be inoffensive.
“Satire Night Live” did levity nearly as well. Though a few of the jokes fell at various points on the spectrum of flatness, the vivacious performances of the cast saved them. For their portrayals of Jack and Brody in a spin-off of the near and dear TV show “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” someone should give Eric J. Cheng ’20 and Nick Durham ’20 their own Disney show right now.
Exiting the theater to more masterpieces from “The Sound of Music” and Robyn’s “Body Talk,” the audience feels elevated even right after realizing that they are guilty of numerous Harvard falsities. This in and of itself is proof that “Satire Night Live” has done its duty. For more hilarious revelations, the student body should be looking forward to more Satire V/On Harvard Time collaborations that are hopefully to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clad in a quirky suit to match his quirky persona, David Sedaris, comedian and author of several novels, walked out into the spotlight on the stage of Symphony Hall. Men and women quickly took their seats and the talkative buzz quieted as Sedaris took his place behind the podium. As a part of the Celebrity Series of Boston, Sedaris performed some of his highlights aloud on Wednesday, Oct. 18. “I’m happy to be alive,” he said, before diving into his first story, which is a recollection of strangely elaborate insults that people from different countries use.
Sedaris has recently released his own collection of select diary entries, compiled into one book named “Theft by Finding: Diaries (1977–2002),” and he read some of the diary pieces aloud to a crowd inside of Symphony Hall.
“I love his voice as a reader, and I am really enjoying the diaries because it’s such an insight to him when he first started writing,” said Trisha Flanagan, an audience member who described herself as a long-time fan. “I am so glad that he’s sharing them now. He lived up to all my expectations and my expectations were really high.”
He began the show with his ability to shock the audience. “What is another way to say someone is f***ing piece of shit asshole?” he asked, taking the audience by surprise. The audience, mostly older men and women, released startled laughs. Some of Sedaris’ well-known books include “Me Talk Pretty One Day” and “Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls.” Sedaris is known for his satirical and blunt humor as well as his storytelling capabilities, seen in both “The New Yorker” and the podcast “This American Life.”
“I just thought he was hilarious,” Zoey Sarah, an audience member who read Sedaris’ books in high school, said. “He definitely lives up to that, even with his new book. I enjoyed this opener with the different languages and the way people swear.
Alongside these moments of startled laughter, Sedaris hit some nervesーin a good and profound way. He talked about the stark difference between his past and present, causing a sense of nostalgia amongst the chuckles. Specifically, he spoke of his father and the sadness he feels because of his father’s loneliness. His father refuses to live in a nursing home and instead stays in his rusty old house. Sedaris seemed to be making peace with this.
With speaking about his past, Sedaris also subtly commented on the current political situation, taking a few jabs at the Trump presidency.
“I love his take on everyday observations considered so absurd in our time, like all the tiny things,” Flanagan said. “He has such a keenly nuanced observation of the day-to-day silliness and I love what he brings to that.”
Hugh Hamrick, Sedaris’ partner, does not accompany him on tours. “He has better things to do,” Sedaris said.

Winner of the Palme D’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, “The Square” is a super-smart satire that skewers the contemporary art scene, calls out champagne socialists and shames all of our egos. Mixing cynicism with imagination, director Ruben Östlund artfully frames our political correct culture and socialist-leaning art world as a hypocritical cover for the deep discomfort we truly feel towards the otherized.
The film develops around a central question: How much do we really trust and care about people we don’t know? The answer lies in the actions of an egotistical art museum curator, Christian (Claes Bang), as he tries to untangle himself from a host of mishandlings involving the theft of his wallet and phone and the exhibition of an artwork, “The Square.”
“The Square” is a 4-meter square installation piece that, according to the artist’s statement, is a sanctuary of trust and caring within which everyone shares equal rights and obligations, or as one of the fancy-pants museum board members blandly puts it, a very nice project that communicates an important message. There are in fact real-life installations of “The Square” in several Scandinavian art museums by Östlund himself and co-artist Kalle Boman, which inspired the making of the film. Their idealistic artistic statement serves as a staggering contrast to the numerous daily, inhumane actions that unfold in the film.
As Christian tries to recover his possessions while publicizing “The Square,” he soon reveals his shallowness in all aspects of his life, especially in his attitudes towards the homeless on the footstep of the gallery. The curator’s swift role reversals bring out his contradictions and, once the audience learns the formula, have them anticipating the next movement. From the hero of the vulnerable, to the embodiment of the apathetic elite, to a beggar, Christian’s ever-changing personas always surpass expectations. Yet in critiquing his work, love, and family life, the film also ensures his well-roundedness and relatability. In some ways, the audience might relate best to the aspects of Christian’s character that are least likable: He is a mirror to the more ungenerous versions of ourselves.
Apart from Christian, another stand-out character is TV journalist Anne, thanks to the stunningly odd yet strong performance by Elisabeth Moss. Her bizarre probings into Christian’s consciousness leave the audience baffled but entertained, and buried in her senselessness is some sharp critique of elitism and masculinity today. The most unforgettable acting, however, comes from performance artist Terry Notary as Oleg the man-ape. The beast intrudes on the museum affiliates’ banquet and leads to a stunningly violent confrontation between the primitive and the cultured. Interestingly, Notary also gave the movements for the animals in the new “Planet of the Apes” series, which similarly reflects on the actions of the modern man through the actions of beasts.
Of course, part of the meta-irony of “The Square” is the fact that it is a criticism of contemporary art and yet a near-perfect work of art itself. And the joke is lost on no one that a film about the socialist-minded elites shunning the homeless goes on to win at the ritzy Cannes Film Festival. In fact, Ostlund’s work is the newest addition to a whole canon of films about the hypocrisy of elites, from “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” to “Orchestra Rehearsal,” that have been enthusiastically celebrated for decades by the elite class, so much so that their directors won themselves acceptance as social elites.  Every satirical moment hits its mark.
Poignant and perturbing, “The Square” lingers not only for the absurd, humorous moments. After all, on our way to grab our Starbucks Pumpkin Spice coffee or CVS late-night purchase, we each have to cross the square.

The season two premiere of “Riverdale,” our decade’s gritty answer to “Gossip Girl,” demonstrates that the writers at The CW have elevated teen drama to an art form. Bathed in fluorescent diner light, the show’s high schoolers face a mix of personal anguish and occasional murder. “Riverdale” ultimately succeeds by using murder mystery to highlight the struggles of modern teen life.
The episode wastes no time reorienting the viewer to the conflict of last season. In his typical melodramatic fashion, Jughead says, “Jubilee was supposed to change everything. Be a new start. But when we woke up the next morning, Riverdale was still, at its heart, a haunted town.” The show throws us directly back into the action with a clip of Archie’s father being shot and rushed to the hospital. The rest of the episode slathers on the suspense, offering limited information and many flashbacks, and leaving the viewers unsure of his fate.
Of course, no attempted murder occurs in a vacuum, and it follows that the rest of the characters respond to the assault in their own ways. Jughead turns to his dark past and his father’s gang involvement to uncover information. Veronica lashes out at her parents, accusing them of foul play in their business dealings. Normally, these plot devices would be unnecessarily heavy and out of place in a show about teenagers, but the highs and lows of the murder mystery seem to reflect the tumultuous nature of youth.
And for all the commotion going on in the small town, “Riverdale” never loses sight of its audience. Familiar themes emerge throughout the show: young love, angst, fitting in. Family drama seems to be a favorite of the writers as well, with strained parent-child relationships abounding in the town. “Riverdale” is the quintessential teenage experience cleverly masquerading as a detective mystery.
The general campiness of the plot devices and immaturity of the characters show that the writers are very much in on the joke. The strife that Archie faces with his father, for example, is punctuated with a session in the shower with his girlfriend followed by an unnecessary fight which is equally inappropriate given the situation. Cheryl, resident queen bee of the school, whispers to her mother that “If you breathe, it’s because I give you air” after burning her mansion to the ground. Jughead, the resident voice of reason, upon hearing the owner of a local diner refer to the murderer on the loose as an “angel of death,” responds with, “You sound like the cranky old guy in the ‘Friday the 13th’ movies.” The show counterbalances its darkness with general teenage absurdity as a reminder that this is, above all, a show meant to entertain young adults.
On paper, the “Degrassi”-meets-“Twin Peaks” concept of “Riverdale” seems to be a recipe for disaster. In practice, however, it’s unexpectedly compelling. The writers at The CW have managed to reconcile the two genres and construct a show which capitalizes on their overlap. This is the high school experience, with all of its highs and lows, playing out with high drama, and it makes sense that viewers are flocking to watch.

As the University undertakes the arduous, nuanced, and rigorous task of selecting its next President, few groups will exert as great an influence over this process as its Faculty. While the search committee consists of all 12 Harvard Corporation members and three members of the Board of Overseers, it will be advised by a committee of faculty members, as well as one of staff and one of students. In light of this upcoming transition in University leadership, and in light of the Faculty’s overwhelming interest in recent policies concerning undergraduate social life, the subject of faculty governance—how much influence faculty members should wield on University issues outside of their own research, teaching, or department—has become salient.
Ultimately, faculty governance is invaluable. For instance, if Harvard College truly aims to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,” it should take efforts to ensure that those with the most responsibility to execute this education—its faculty—should play an active role in solving the issues of the day. In the same vein, the search committee should seek out candidates who, if selected, would hold faculty governance in high regard.
This holds true even for issues on which faculty may not have the most pertinent expertise. Regardless of the subject in question, faculty can, and should, offer a range of intelligent, constructive viewpoints with an eye toward the University’s best interests, and, on contentious issues, they can offer a check on administrative power.
However, this last point merits a word of caution. Faculty may be more qualified to offer advice on some University-wide issues, such as those pertaining to research funding, or to the role of their department or school within the University, than on other issues, such as those that may affect them less directly, or on which they may have less relevant expertise. Given this delineation, it seems appropriate that the extent of faculty governance on a subject should, to some degree, be tailored to the subject itself.
A necessary complement to this idea concerns administrative power. Especially on issues to which faculty may be less attuned, Harvard should ensure that it hires and trains administrators with relevant expertise. By way of example, while the Faculty can and should play an important role in the undergraduate experience, the College needs administrators who are qualified to address the aspects of undergraduate life on which faculty may be unable to exert direct guidance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I support feminism. I support the Black Lives Matter movement. I support LGBTQ+ rights. I support a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine. I support equality. I think that each of these movements is incredibly important, but I don’t think that they should be connected.
Although intersectionality is prevalent in each of these movements, feminism is the one that pertains most to me. It is where my largest grievances lie, and I’ve identified as a feminist since learning what it was because it made sense to me. I am a woman and I want equal opportunity and treatment, so of course I am a feminist. However, I’m starting to doubt my role in the movement because my Zionist beliefs are not supported in the community. I will always stand up against any gender-based discrimination, but can I really do that under the label of a feminist? I say this because I’m not sure that feminism has a place for me anymore.
The politicization of the feminist movement has made it increasingly anti-Zionist. My support for a two-state solution is being challenged by a movement that I so heavily identified with. I used to think that the leaders of the feminist movement were women who were standing up on behalf of people like me. Yet, that’s where I was mistaken—they aren’t.
Linda Sarsour, an organizer of the 2017 Women’s March, explicitly stated in an interview with The Nation that Zionism and feminism are incompatible: “It just doesn’t make any sense for someone to say, ‘Is there room for people who support the state of Israel and do not criticize it in the movement?’ There can’t be in feminism.”
On March 8, for International Women’s Day, women around the world abstained from working in order to initiate a movement of international feminism. However, part of International Women’s Strike platform called the “decolonization of Palestine” an element of “the beating heart of this new feminist movement.” It goes on to say that they “want to dismantle all walls, from prison walls to border walls, from Mexico to Palestine.” This supposed unity of feminism is one that alienates people in the process.
The LGBTQ+ movement, combined with the feminist movement, was pushing an anti-Zionist agenda with The Chicago Dyke March of Summer 2017, in which two Jewish lesbians were ejected for hoping to walk with Star of David pride flags. Jews were not allowed to march for their LGBTQ+ identities without renouncing Israel.
I understand that intersectionality occurs in order to make movements stronger, and to align them with more people. But the devolvement of feminism comes in the opposite form. Instead, leaders in the feminist movement are starting to alienate people by drawing boundaries of who exactly can identify as a feminist.
As long as you identify with a given movement, I don’t think that you should be penalized on account of your other political beliefs—and this very belief was something that was challenged when I arrived at Harvard.
I met a girl that I really respected for her work with immigration and within the public service industry. We were having a conversation about feminism and about our frustrations with the movement when she disclosed to me that she’s anti-abortion.
Our previously fluid conversation paused for a few beats. I realized that her experience has been similar to mine. On account of her religious beliefs, she was excluded from feminist groups at her high school, she never felt completely comfortable identifying with feminism, and especially recently, she had started to feel really alienated by the movement.
I was at a loss for words because I was faced with my own unconscious correlation between body feminism and social feminism. But my definition in feminism is an overarching belief in equal rights. She believes in equal rights, therefore she is a feminist. I believe in Zionism, but I am a feminist too.

Two weeks ago, the U.S. men’s national soccer team lost a FIFA World Cup qualifier, and, with it, lost their chance to compete at the tournament in Russia next year. Naturally, the loss spurred an outpouring of frustration from fans, prompting complaints about the quality of international play and headlines like “United States Misses World Cup for First Time Since 1986.”
That isn’t true. The U.S. will have a national team—the women’s team—at the FIFA World Cup, defending their title. In fact, this squad has won three World Cups and four Olympic Games. For comparison, the last time the men’s team medaled at either of those events was a World Cup bronze in 1930.
Fans of the U.S. women’s team were quick to point out the team’s success. But, to me, this conversation also serves to highlight the fact that it takes a men’s team doing—or not doing—something for the analogous women’s team’s accomplishments to be celebrated. Or it takes a women’s team boycotting for fair pay for them to get attention. Boycotting, of course, takes courage and sacrifice, and by no means should that be understated. It’s also true that because of poor funding and support, even at the professional level, women’s sports can be a difficult realm. Nevertheless, the coverage that women’s sports receives, and the public perception of women’s sports, seems overwhelming compared to men’s sports, or focuses on the players first and foremost as women. Is this the way we should be talking about them?
Even outside of this phenomenon, studies show that coverage of women’s sports is flawed as is, and reinforces gender stereotypes in subtle ways. But we also have a tendency to speak of everything a female athlete does as revolutionary, empowering, brave—carrying the mantle of all women everywhere. Is it fair to expect female athletes to put so much on the line for greater causes? This past March, Meghan Duggan, captain of the U.S. women’s national ice hockey team, personally reached out to over 100 players in the prospect pool to encourage them to boycott for the same treatment as the men’s team. Some of those prospects were teenage girls, facing a difficult choice between joining Duggan and a once-in-a-lifetime chance to play for their country. They all ended up participating in the boycott.
Women who play at a national level already have to struggle to get there, which entails navigating a lack of resources at lower levels, facing all kinds of discouragement and difficulty as young players—and then rising to the top only to realize how little they will be compensated, even as Olympians or World Champions. And, on top of this success, we expect advocacy: We tell them to work more, struggle more, for the girls who are following in their footsteps. It isn’t an easy situation to be in. We don’t seem to expect male athletes to give more than lip service to equality in sports, even though they often have larger platforms and louder voices.
It seems that if female athletes at the peak of their sport aren’t using their voices to change the system, few others will. We hold them to high standards and celebrate their achievements, but it’s lonely at the top, and the rest of the sports world doesn’t do enough to change that. So, yes, we should expect the world champion to think of her Little League fans. But she should not be in her fight alone.
For now, the Serena Williamses and Megan Rapinoes of the world do stand for something greater. During the next few years, in which the U.S. women’s soccer team will be the only soccer team to play at that high a level in this country, perhaps we can reconsider how we see these women. After all, there is no excuse now not to unite behind them.

Chinese President Xi Jingping may continue to centralize his power even as the country’s ideological balance remains constant, experts in international relations predicted at an event with Harvard’s Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott on Monday afternoon.
The panel, titled “China’s Future Leadership: An Instant Analysis of China’s 19th Party Congress,” is part of Harvard University’s Worldwide Week, a week of events designed to bring awareness to Harvard’s scholarship on a global stage.
Over the course of the event, the panelists discussed Xi’s politics, power dynamics within the Communist Party of China, and similarities between China's current leadership and previous party leaders, including Chairman Mao Zedong.
Edward Wong, a  foreign correspondent for The New York Times and current fellow at the Nieman Foundation spoke about party power in the “post-Deng” era. Deng Xiaoping led China for more than a decade during the 1970s and 1980s.
“I think there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the party’s center, led by Xi, still has a very hard time imposing its will in a deeply effective and uniform way on local officials,” Wong said.
Government professor Elizabeth J. Perry drew comparisons between Xi’s initiatives to Mao’s policies, while also highlighting “worrisome” aspects of China’s “New Era” technological innovations.
“Technology is not only just a powerful tool for making information more publicly accessible, it’s also a powerful tool of censorship,” she said.
Huang Yasheng, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, remarked on China’s shift from a “check and balance system” to a more centralized government.
“The 19th Party Congress is going to accentuate the centralization rather than reducing it,” Yasheng said.
“I believe the West also bears a responsibility for the rise of strongman politics,” Yasheng added.
Yasheng said the 2008 economic downturn and the election of President Donald Trump “have gone a very long way to dismantle the legitimacy of economic capitalism and political capitalism.”
Although most of the discussion was focused on China’s leadership and political trends, Perry also talked about the comparison between analyzing Chinese politics as an American and as a Chinese person.
“I think there is something to be said for the advantages of being outside a society, for seeing the big picture, for seeing it through different eyes,” she said. “But I also think there are real advantages to Chinese working within China, not only by being able to see up close-hand the nuances of Chinese politics, but also being the only people who are in a position to pass moral judgments and evaluations about their own politics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard joined hundreds of other universities in signing a letter last Thursday urging Congressional leaders to support “Dreamers,” or undocumented immigrants who had been granted the right to work and study in the United States by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
President Trump ended the Obama-era program in early September but gave Congress six months to preserve the protections DACA recipients had previously enjoyed. The letter to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, and Chuck Schumer claimed that universities were “ready to work with Congress in a bipartisan manner” to protect undocumented students.
“[W]e urge you to take the action that President Trump requested when he rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, and pass a long-term legislative fix as soon as possible to protect Dreamers,” the letter said.
The American Council on Education, an organization that represents nearly 1,800 colleges, universities, and other groups that promote higher education coordinated efforts to compile the letter on behalf of the Protect Dreamers Higher Education Coalition. The Coalition is a larger group encompassing the ACE and other higher education associations.
In asking Congress to devise a legislative solution to the end of DACA, the letter referenced “widespread support” for DACA recipients. According to the letter, polls conducted by various news organizations had found that over 60 percent of Americans believe Congress needs to protect DACA recipients. Hundreds of business leaders have also voiced their support for DACA recipients.
The letter emphasized that many of the schools that had signed the letter had seen “these remarkable people up close.” Dozens of DACA beneficiaries currently attend Harvard.
“[Dreamers] have made incredible contributions to our country and its economy and security. They should continue to be able to do so,” the letter said. “If we are unable to protect these Dreamers, we will be shutting the door to an entire generation of individuals who seek to contribute their best to America.”
Thursday’s letter was not the first time Harvard has spoken out on the issue. University President Drew G. Faust sent two letters to Trump in support of DACA after his election. Shortly after he announced the end of the program, Faust denounced his decision as “cruel.” Recently, she joined other prominent figures including business leaders and politicians to found the Dream Coalition, which pushes for legislation that supports undocumented students.

University President Drew G. Faust said she supports Boston’s bid to host tech giant Amazon’s second headquarters, touting the city’s “intellectual infrastructure” in a letter sent to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
Faust’s testimonial was one of many included in the proposals that Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts each submitted to the e-commerce retailer, which is currently considering more than 200 bids from North American in search of a site for its $5 billion “HQ2.” Boston is considered a leading contender for the headquarters, and submitted its proposal to Amazon last week.
In her letter, Faust wrote that universities like Harvard play a critical role in making the Boston area “a competitive place for Amazon’s next venture, and for the future generations of thinkers and creators who will live, study, and work here.”
Citing Boston’s top-notch research and teaching facilities, including the University’s new science and technology campus in Allston, Faust presented a region brimming with innovation. The “academic energy” in the area, she wrote, fuels a knowledge-based economy and supports a high quality of life.Faust also referred to the “promising pipeline” of highly-skilled labor in the region, including students from Harvard.
“In the last ten years at our university alone, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has experienced explosive growth, tripling the number of concentrators in applied mathematics, computer science, and biomedical, electrical, and mechanical engineering,” she wrote, adding that students in social sciences and humanities also “bring critical analytical and communications skills” to a variety of industries.
She ended the letter with an entreaty to Amazon.
“Amazon, and its commitment to service, innovation, and discovery, would be a welcome addition to our remarkable community here in Greater Boston. I hope you will join us,” she wrote.
In addition to Faust’s letter in the appendix, the lengthy Massachusetts report itself repeatedly mentions Harvard as a key draw for why Amazon should open in or near Boston.
One of the reports’ suggested supplementary sites, in Allston, positions the headquarters near Harvard’s new $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex, set to open in fall of 2020.
Boston also proposed Suffolk Downs—a former horse-racing track in East Boston—as a primary site for the headquarters, and offered a proposal to spend $750 million to link the MBTA’s Blue Line with the Red Line, easing transportation to HQ2.
In September, the company announced its plans to expand from its headquarters in Seattle and open a second base that would hire 50,000 full time workers. In its request for proposals, the company said it would focus on metropolitan areas with more than 1 million people, strong job growth, and strong public transportation, among other factors. It plans to make a final decision early next year.
Amazon currently has facilities in Boston’s Back Bay and Cambridge’s Kendall Square, with plans to open another Boston office next year.

Margaret W. Busse, the Associate Director in charge of Alumni Engagement for the Business School’s Social Enterprise Initiative, announced her candidacy for Mass. state Senate this week.
She hopes to challenge current Middlesex-Worcester District incumbent Democrat James B. Eldridge, who has served in the role since 2009.
In an interview, Busse, who identifies as a Republican, said she decided to run because she wants to transcend partisanship in politics.
“I think a lot of folks are, have just been sort of dismayed at the level of acrimony and just kind of jumble approach that politicians often take by trying to be purposely divisive and inflammatory,” Busse said.
She said her three main focuses will be creating jobs, improving public schools, and building “vibrant communities.” She said she thinks her experience chairing the Finance Committee of Acton, Mass. has prepared her for a job as state senator.
“My proven ability to bring diverse people to the table and forge creative solutions to community problems is just what this district needs,” a press release announcing her campaign reads.
Busse praised the political priorities and methods of Governor Charles D. Baker ’79. She said she seeks to emulate his governing style.
“We need to grow our economy in the cooperative and effective governmental climate created by the Baker/Polito Administration,” she wrote in the press release.
Busse is challenging the Democratic incumbent at a time when Democrats hold the majority of Massachusetts state senatorial seats. They currently have 34 seats in the 40-person Senate and 126 seats out of 160 in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.
Recently, contested state elections have been relatively rare in Massachusetts. In 2016, less than one third of the 200 districts had contested elections.
To be elected, Busse will have to secure the Republican nomination, then defeat Eldridge in the general election. While Busse said she is the only Republican candidate to announce candidacy so far, the deadline to declare is not until spring 2018.
Busse, who has degrees from Harvard and Brigham Young University, lives in Acton with her husband. They have five children.
Busse said she has not yet decided whether she will step down from her Business School position if elected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three experts on religion discussed the relationship between theology, wealth, and President Donald Trump’s popularity among evangelicals on Monday evening at the Institute of Politics.
This panel, moderated by Shorestein Center Director Nicco Mele focused in particular on a religious belief termed “the prosperity gospel.” Popular among some American Protestants, the prosperity gospel is a concept which holds that material wealth and physical health are signs that an individual is favored by God.
Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, identifies the prosperity gospel as a belief which “hinges on the principles of sowing material goods and then reaping in return” and which involves “viewing the Bible as a contract between believers and God” that guarantees material security to the faithful.
Throughout the panel, Sally Quinn, an author and columnist with the Washington Post, drew parallels between the prosperity gospel and the religious forces at work in the Trump administration. She attributes Trump’s political success to the growing popularity of the prosperity gospel, identifying the theology’s influence among informal advisers for spiritual matters.
Mele asked the panel about how evangelicals can show such fervent support for a man “who has lied about giving to charity, who has been divorced twice, who has bragged and used terrible language to talk about women and sex.”
To answer the question, Divinity School Visiting Professor and columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. pointed to one poll early on in the election season that spoke to why Trump’s message resonated with evangelicals. The poll question asked respondents whether they would support a candidate willing to “break the rules...to put things right.”
“Trump’s strength among evangelicals initially came from those evangelicals who said [they] want somebody to break the rules,” he said.
Walton noted how Trump’s career as a businessman further worked to his advantage in appealing to the broader public.
“When we think about the archetype of who is successful and prosperous in American society, beginning in the 19th century the businessman rose to the level of the high priests of American capitalism. The businessman since the 19th century has continued to have that kind of purchase on America,” Walton said.
Antonios Trimpalis, a postdoctoral fellow at Tufts University who attended the event, agreed with the panel’s analysis of the prosperity gospel’s role in American politics.
“I think they have the right view on how Donald Trump has used the prosperity gospel for his own political gain,” he said. “I identify with what [Walton] said about how American tradition and history has led to the prosperity gospel.”

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate whose campaign railed against wealth inequality and spurred a new political movement on the American left, endorsed five candidates for Cambridge City Council on Monday.
Sanders, who visited Cambridge and Somerville for a rally, was speaking on behalf of political action group Our Revolution, which is based off of his presidential run. The group endorsed five of the twenty-six candidates running for Cambridge City Council: Sumbul Siddiqui, Vatsady Sivongxay, Quinton Zondervan, and incumbents Dennis J. Carlone and Jan Devereaux. He also endorsed candidates for a number of Somerville positions.
According to Our Revolution’s website, the event was meant to garner support for candidates who “fight for livable wages, affordable housing, and quality public education.”
Incumbent City Councillor Jan Devereux, who received an endorsement from Sanders, said she was happy with the event.
“To hear Senator Sanders speak in person, a first for me, in a small venue was a great way to kick off the last two weeks of my campaign,” she said. “He also stressed the importance of reforming and reinvigorating our democracy from the bottom up which as a local elected official was music to my ears.”
Sanders’s speech focused on eroding the influence of wealth in politics, speaking out against private funding for elections and calling for a “livable wage.” He also said Cambridge should be proud to be the home of so many prestigious universities.
“What the political revolution is about, is we’re saying if we’re going to be successful in taking on the billionaire class whose greed is destroying this country, we need a mass movement of people at the grassroots level who are going to stand up and fight back,” Sanders said.
“That means getting involved, and that’s what your candidates are doing at the local level.” he added.
But not everyone was satisfied with Sanders’s visit.
In a letter to Sanders, several local officials and politicians, including Mass. State Rep. Marjorie Decker, criticized his decision to endorse local candidates, calling it unnecessary.
“There are many races around the country, including some local ones, where a progressive voice is needed. Intervening in the Cambridge city council race is a counterproductive  choice and divides, rather than unites, progressives here,” the letter reads.
A Better Cambridge, which refers to itself as “a citywide resident group,” has also endorsed candidates for the election, including current Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons, Vice Mayor Marc McGovern, as well as contenders Samuel Gebru, Adriane Musgrave, and Alanna Mallon.
The Cambridge City election will be held on Nov. 7.

As midterm season wears on, some courses have altered the way they administer their assessments by integrating technology into traditional exam formats.
One course, Societies of the World 34: “The Caribbean: Globalization, Socio-Economic Development & Cultural Adaption,” used a one-hour online midterm that students could take at any point over a 24-hour period, according to Zachary R. Wehrwein one of the course’s teaching fellows.
Wehrwein said that the midterm was designed in this way to provide students with some flexibility of when it was most convenient to take it during this period.
“I felt less pressure about the test, because I could plan my day around when I wanted to take it and could make sure I had all my materials ready,” said Alexandra E. Summa ’20.
Some other students, including Christabel L. Narh ’18, said that they found the process of taking it online to be more stress-inducing.
“The timer was constantly there which made me more nervous, and that’s not necessarily the case for an hour exam in a lecture hall,” Narh said.
According to Wehrwein, this midterm exam was “an ‘open notes’ but not an ‘open peers’ test.” This means that students were able to consult their class materials, but had to take the test alone and could only submit their written work.
Wehrwein said that the midterm was meant to test the extent to which the students had read and understood the course’s readings and lectures material.
Some students, including Kiffen M. Loomis ’20, said that he would have preferred if the test were a more traditional format.
“I would have liked it to be in class for an hour because it relies more on what you know and not what you can find from your notes and copy and paste into the essay,” Loomis said.
Wehrwein added that the midterm was simply one way in which the course tests students’ knowledge.
“I am confident that we are going to be able to assess all students ability. This is one piece of the whole puzzle,” Wehrwein said.
Another course, Sociology 144: “Economic Sociology,” also allowed students to take the midterms on their personal computers but required students to do so in-class.
According to Chris S. Lee ’18, who is taking the course, students were allowed to have notes with them, but could only use material that was printed out and could not access any outside material.
Lee said that although he enjoyed being allowed to type the essays, he found it disruptive to keep referring back and forth to the papers.
“With all the notes on paper there was a lot of time figuring out where everything was and it felt rushed,” Lee said.
Narh added that she personally prefers writing in class essays by hand to writing them.
“Writing them by hand allows me to gather my thoughts and figure out what I want to say,” Narh said.
Wehrwein added that from an instructor's point of view, although Canvas allows instructors to set a time limit for any given assessment, the process for grading papers through the site is cumbersome.
“The site doesn’t have the option for detailed writing responses, which you would ideally have for a general education course,” he said.

A documentary detailing Harvard's role in unprecedented cultural exchange between Cuba and the United States, titled “Los Cubanos de Harvard”—or “The Harvard Cubans”—made its premiere at the Tsai Auditorium Monday evening.
Presented by the film’s director Danny González Lucena and historian Marial Iglesias Utset, the film focused on a summer visit to Harvard that roughly 1,300 visits undertook in 1900.
Organized by Cuba’s then-Superintendent of Schools Alexis E. Frye, who had studied at Harvard, the “Cuban Expedition” aimed to expose the Cuban teachers to American pedagogy at Harvard’s summer school. The event was considered the most significant cultural exchange between the two nations at the time, according to the filmmakers.
Librarian William Coolidge Lane documented the Cuban Expedition at the time, overseeing the creation of a time capsule containing diary entries from the Cuban teachers and their American hosts. Utset said she rediscovered the capsule, at that point largely forgotten, in the 1990s.
“I wanted to use another way to tell my country’s story, something outside of the normal framework,” Utset said of the documentary.
Utset said she was surprised by the extent that the Expedition affected the formation of the Cuban public school system. The teachers who went on the Expedition accounted for over half of all the teachers in Cuba at the time, and following their return, Utset said the Cuban public school system experienced significant advancements.
The teachers’ stay in Cambridge attracted intense media attention, particularly fixating on the race and gender of the Cuban teachers, according to the documentary. At the time, Utset said, Harvard had only a handful of non-white students, and all students at the College were men.
The documentary also explored the relationships that developed between the Cubans and the Americans, concluding with a love story between the American-born Frye and one of the teachers.
Lucena said he wanted to prove that Cuba and the United States have been friendlier in the past.
“This is the way I found to humanize the topic,” Lucena said. “Human relations matter, especially to two countries in conflict.”
The event was billed as part of Harvard’s first Worldwide Week, which aims to “bring together faculty and students and staff across school and disciplinary boundaries to make connections and start conversations about global issues,” according to Todd Washburn, Senior Assistant Provost for International Affairs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pervasive construction noise and debris at Harvard-owned apartment complex Holden Green over the last few months have driven some residents to prepare to bring an organized complaint to the University about their living conditions.
Residents of the complex, many of them graduate students and professors, describe seemingly endless piles of dust, deafening jackhammering, and occasional water leakage throughout the century-old buildings as construction crews complete renovations.
On Thursday, about a dozen tenants gathered to share stories of how the project has impacted their lives and to discuss how to share their complaints with the University. They plan to deliver a formal complaint to Harvard in the near future and are asking for a reduction in rental rates.
Christopher J. Williams, one of the organizers of the meeting, said that he felt compelled to bring his neighbors together after the University did not adequately respond to his individual concerns.
“We sat down with the Managing Director of Harvard Housing and he was pretty unresponsive,” Williams said. “He listened but he didn’t really give any kind of leeway, he didn’t apologize, he didn’t really acknowledge that they had created this–that it was a terrible situation.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that the University is working closely with residents to minimize the project’s impact on residents of Holden Green.
“The project team and Harvard’s construction mitigation personnel are working to mitigate construction impacts to the extent possible, including providing residents with information about schedules and the location of construction activities in advance,” O’Rourke wrote. “We appreciate the continued patience of residents as we work to complete the project in a timely manner.”
At the meeting on Thursday, residents shared stories about constantly cleaning dust out of their homes and waking up on the weekends to the sound of construction crews outside their windows.
David F. Cavell told the group about how the dust caused his air conditioner to break. Unable to leave his windows open because of the dust from the construction outside, Cavell believes the resulting temperatures in his home put the health of his dog at risk.
“At one point this summer I came back into our home after I had been out for the day and in our home the temperatures must have been close to 90 degrees and our dog was basically trapped in a sauna for the entire day,” Cavell said. “When I came home at the end of the day, he was just sitting on the floor panting in distress.”
Many residents said after the Thursday meeting that they chose to live at Holden Green because of its close-knit community and on-site playground. But they said the construction has made Holden Green an unsafe environment to raise children.
“It’s literally an active construction site and it’s a hard hat zone and I have a 2 ½ year old who doesn’t have a hard hat,” Williams said. “We have heavy equipment in our back yard.”
Residents at Holden Green are required to sign a construction rider as part of their lease;  it details construction projects that will be taking place on the property. While the rider states that the process will be noisy and dusty will take place 9 to 11 hours a day, six days a week, many of the residents at the meeting on Monday said that the rider did not properly indicate how intrusive the construction would be in their day-to-day lives.
Xiaoqian Hu and her husband moved to Holden Green at the end of the summer with a toddler and a newborn. She said that had she understood the extent of the construction, she would not have moved her family to the neighborhood.
“I did not realize that they would be doing this everyday and the noise would be so loud and the dust would be just flowing everywhere,” Hu said.
Attendees at the meeting said that they hope that by collecting their stories and organizing their complaints they can work with the University to talk about rent reductions as well ensuring that in the future, residents are better informed about construction projects.
“We think that because we haven’t had full access to the–our apartments in the way that we thought, we should be–have a rent reduction for the scope of the project,” Williams said.
Residents say they came out of the meeting feeling reinvigorated.
“I think that what really struck is that all of us felt alone in this process, we felt like we were going through this alone and there was no one to help us,” said Cavell. “All of a sudden thanks to Chris and to [Kate D. Cavell] and to others we realized that we really are still a community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Friday night, Harvard lost under the lights for the first time in program history. Princeton (5-1, 2-1 Ivy) dominated from the kickoff, scoring 17 unanswered points to start the game and commanding a 31-10 halftime advantage. The visitors gained 573 total yards, which is the highest mark against the Crimson so far this year.
Harvard (3-3, 1-2) now has the narrowest of windows to contend for an Ancient Eight title. Conceivably, the Crimson could win out and finish 5-2 in league play. In that scenario, the stretch run could be very intriguing, as four teams currently sit at 2-1.
KANOFF WAS ON
“We were focused every single play,” said Tigers senior quarterback Chad Kanoff. “It’s not like I’m just running around drawing plays in the dirt. I think we’re focused every play…. We want to complete every ball, so we did a pretty good job of doing that tonight.”
And complete every ball he did—almost.
Kanoff was on fire throughout the first half, throwing a perfect 20-for-20 for 323 yards and two touchdowns. All told, the Tigers signal caller finished 31-of-35 and racked up 421 yards in the air.
Generally, Kanoff hit his top two receivers with impunity, as juniors Jesper Horsted and Stephen Carlson consistently found themselves with space to spare when targeted.
However, even when defenders draped themselves on the receiving duo, Kanoff still managed to complete his passes. In the third quarter, the quarterback lofted a pass to Horsted, who reached around his man and grabbed the ball with one hand at the three-yard line.
Kanoff and Horsted benefited from coach Bob Surace’s up-tempo play-calling. With halftime approaching, Princeton breezed through an 80-yard drive in 57 seconds. In all, the Tigers ran 76 total plays in just 32:31 of game time.
“There’s days in practice where I usually watch the offense, not that I don’t care about the defense, but we get in a zone,” Surace said. “I felt we were in the zone in the first half. I think we had five drives. We scored all five times. I loved how fast we played.”
Adding to Kanoff’s impressive display was his punting, as the senior also contributes to Princeton’s special teams.
“I'd yell at him because his punts weren't high enough,” Surace said. “That's a little joke we have. They had a great returner and we wanted hang time on the punts and I had to find some flaw there.”
EARNING THEIR STRIPES
In previous weeks, the Tigers defense had shown flashes of brilliance. A week before the Harvard game, Princeton blanked Brown in Providence, R.I. It gave up just 17 points in each of its first two games, both victories against non-conference opponents.
However, the Tigers were tripped up by Columbia in week three, 28-24. Seven days later, Georgetown put up 30 points on Princeton, but the prolific offense bailed out the defense in the Tigers’ 20-point win.
This game was a true test of the Tigers’ defensive prowess, and they passed with flying colors.
“We talk about running every day, and we had our secondary breaking on those flat routes, which have kind of given us some pain in the beginning of the season,” said Princeton junior linebacker Tom Johnson. “Definitely a point of emphasis is no big plays every week.”
The Crimson struggled to gain yards after contact on rushing plays, something that it has used to its advantage in earlier games this season. Junior running back Charlie Booker averaged just 3.8 yards per carry, and the longest run of the day belonged to freshman quarterback Jake Smith on a 26-yard scramble in the second quarter.
Smith recorded his career high in yardage, but for the fourth straight week he conceded an interception. Princeton’s defensive line did not pressure Smith or the Harvard backs often, as the rookie quarterback was not sacked. However, the Tigers made stops when it mattered—the Crimson converted just three of 10 third-down opportunities.
One of the more clutch plays came at the beginning of the third quarter. After Princeton punted on the first possession after the half, Harvard was driving and looking to chip away at a 21-point deficit.
On second-and-nine, Tigers defensive back Chance Melancon stripped Booker as he reached the line of scrimmage. Sophomore linebacker John Orr dove on the ball, effectively curtailing the Crimson’s momentum and setting up another scoring chance for Princeton.
“Obviously we’ve been on the opposite end of these games, and we knew that these guys were a solid, well-coached team with good speed,” Johnson said. “We had tremendous effort from some younger guys stepping in…and it makes it easy when you’ve got so many guys ready to step up.”

Screw the weather, we're just going to go ahead and declare it "fall" and get on with our lives. In with the sweater weather, out with the classic legs-at-the-beach pics and Snapchats of glasses of iced tea.
But don't be fooled: this season promotes basicness just as much as the summer. And you know what they say, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Here are some basic fall things you can do to contribute to a newsfeed likely already clogged with photos of apple picking outings and piles of yellowing leaves.
Get a Pumpkin Spice Latte
Let’s get the most obvious one out of the way. Sadly, the Starbucks promotion for pumpkin spice whipped cream has passed, but it would be wrong not to grab a quintessential PSL.
Eat some apple pie
This is the only non-pumpkin thing you will consume over these next few months, so treasure it.
Photoshoot at a pumpkin patch
To keep your pumpkin streak hot, go to a pumpkin patch and obnoxiously rearrange them for your photoshoot. When the owners ask if you’re actually going to buy and take one home, tell them off for pressuring you, and then post your Insta. Bonus: If you’re feeling really festive, actually carve a pumpkin.
Pumpkin Everything
Shampoo, pie, conditioner, soap, oreos, candles, cologne, pudding, deodorant, cookies: if your room isn’t filled with pumpkin flavors and products from bottom to top, you have failed.
Take over-filtered pictures of the foliage
“Hey don’t those leaves look really pretty?”
“Yeah why don’t you completely ruin their natural shade by applying several layers of filters on them?”
“You read my mind.”
Start breaking out the winter clothing
Even though the weather doesn’t nearly necessitate such heavy clothing, but if you got it, flaunt it. Patagonia, Canada Goose, Feathered Friends, Arc’teryx: let the world know what you got.
Get drunk on pumpkin spice-flavored alcohol
You didn’t think we were done with pumpkins, did you? If you’re going to pass out, you might as well do it festively.
Fall may seem like a long checklist of things to do and pictures to take, but when the real cold of winter hits, you’ll miss the simple days of foliage.

Thanks to the yet again unseasonably warm weather this past weekend, we couldn’t help but pay a visit to the Head of the Charles Regatta. We followed the flocks of visitors into the preppy pandemonium that accompanies the world’s largest regatta. Here are our reflections on this year’s HOCR.
Disappointing samples
The free food samples seem to get weirder every year. We were faced with strange chips and carbonated drinks that we weren’t sure we liked. The free 5-Hour Energy may have been tempting for those of us who still have midterms left, but the mediocre free snacks made us wish we could afford the overpriced greasy fare sold around the race course.
Attractive people
The food options may have been sub-par, but the eye candy exceeded our expectations. After two months of being surrounded by the same pasty, sleep-deprived Harvard kids, the fit, sunkissed rowers were a breath of fresh air. (Never mind the fact that they’re too busy winning Olympic medals to give us a glance.)
What is going on?
Surprisingly, what shocks us most at the Head of the Charles every year is not Harvard's uber-restrictive security protocols or the high prices at the Brooks Brothers tent, but rather the fact that people actually flock en masse to Cambridge for the event. While the crowd was cheering, commenting appreciatively on different boats, and screaming during the most "dramatic" moments of racing, we were stuck trying to make out whether any of our friends were passing.
A chance to show off
All in all, the regatta gave us a chance to do what Harvard students do best: show off. With sunny Insta posts and Snapchat filters, we got to show our friends that we occasionally leave the Cabot Library basement and have fun. After all, other than  Harvard-Yale weekend and formal season, we don’t get many opportunities to update our social media.
We still have some lingering questions, though: Why do rowing fans enjoy vests so much? What even is rowing? And was that group of tall white guys the punchmasters for the Fly, or members of a men’s heavyweight eight? The world—or at least Flyby—may never know.

Halloween: a time when friend groups all across campus can prove just how tightknit and #goals they are through coordinated group costumes. Costumes with your pals can make preparations for Halloween a fun bonding occasion, especially if you’re having trouble deciding on a costume for yourself. But if you mess it up, your group won’t live it down until Thanksgiving break. Whether you want to look edgy, sexy, or spooky (what?), here’s a list of the best and worst group costumes out there.
Best: TV Show Cast
It’s a classic that may be overused, but there are thousands of TV series out there so your group can always find something original. Make your favorite cartoon series come to life in the form of sleep-deprived Harvard students, or imitate a well-loved sitcom. Imagine, for one night, your friends can be...Friends.
Worst: Rick and Morty
This might be the exception to the rule above. Regardless of your opinion of the show, we can all agree that this fad has run its course. You might think that dressing as the Ricks and Mortys from Dimension B-47 and D-69 will help your group bring the edge, but in reality your Ricks and Mortys will be indistinguishable from all the rest.
Best: Harvard Faculty
Impersonate your favorite professors, and form your own coalition of Harvard’s most notorious faculty. Always obsessing over the Dan/Rich bromance from LS1a? You and your BFF can act out the dream. If you can’t date that one hot TF, be them for a night. Bonus points go to those who score pictures with the teachers they dress up as.
Worst: A Stripping Troupe
We get it. You want to show off your gains. But please, at least do it with a more subtle costume, especially since it’s freshman family weekend. Honestly, any group costume can turn into a stripping troupe if you try hard enough.
Best: Inanimate Objects
Costumes don’t necessarily have to resemble people in order to be great. Halloween is a night to think outside of the box. Depending on the size of your squad, you and your buddies can add a new twist on everyday objects. Have a group of four? Consider embodying the suits of a card deck. Squad of ten? Go party hopping as hopscotch tiles, and make it a challenge to never break formation for the whole night. The possibilities are endless.
Worst: Pumpkin Patch
You know what everyone is tired of seeing? Pumpkins. You know what you just made us all see? Pumpkins. Everywhere.
Best: Clones
If you’re still stuck on who to dress up as, look no further than within your own group. Choose one friend to be themselves, and have everyone else in your circle dress up as them. No squad size restrictions for this one—in fact, this is one case in which the more truly is the merrier.
Worst: Minions
Again, not edgy or entertaining if everyone else is doing it.
We hope we could give your squad some good ideas—and crush some bad ones. And hey, even if your costumes do flop, you have the consolation
