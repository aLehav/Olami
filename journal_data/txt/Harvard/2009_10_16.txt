After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many contemporary plays can be described, in the words of Maria of “Twelfth Night,” as “improbable fiction.” But despite Shakespeare’s often fantastical flourishes, his works have always captured certain human truths. Thanks to this, “The Seven Deadly Sins of Shakespeare,” which ran this weekend at the Adams House Pool Theatre, manages to strike the chords of human folly’s universality using excerpts from the Bard’s plays, allowing the production to resonate, despite its occasional incoherence.
The performance, directed by Sam L. Linden ’10 and put on by the Hyperion Shakespeare Company at Harvard, consists of nine scenes describing the seven deadly sins as manifested in various works of William Shakespeare.  Its characters range from tortured to downright oblivious, and all of them find themselves victims of a particular fatal flaw. One can laugh and even sympathize with them, but would certainly never want to become them, though it is always clear how easily one could.
The Adams Pool Theater, with its minimalist décor, is a fitting setting for the show. The lack of scenery or adornment forces the audience to focus only on the characters and the impassioned speeches they are delivering. The setting becomes irrelevant as it becomes clear that people of any time or place could become victims of the seven sins.  The lighting remains constant, and the lack of dimming between scenes lends a sense of continuity to the show.
While the acts, which collage extracts of Shakespeare’s plays to fit an overarching theme, connect well aesthetically, the content overall is fragmented. And though the idea of compiling scenes to describe the time-old notion of the “seven sins” is inspired, the execution doesn’t fulfill the concept’s potential. The show is lively and entertaining, but only one of its plot lines is fully resolved. The continuation of the “pride” storyline—which appears in three different scenes—is the only to work well. Perhaps developing the other sins a little further would have made the play more memorable.
Nevertheless, the cast leaves an impression on the audience; the acting is sincere, and the performance is engaging. The actors use the theatre well, making the actual space seem larger. They prance through the aisles and leap onto the side ledges, providing a spectacle that captures the audience’s attention from every corner of the room.  We don’t know whether to look at the drunken man staggering through the aisle or the sloppily dressed duo at the front of the room, swinging their legs in unison as they relax on the ledge.
Eduardo J. Perez-Torres ’12 and Sara S. Lytle ’13 particularly stand out from the rest of the cast. They convey the natures of their characters convincingly and clearly. Lytie emanates sheer evil when she stares into the audience, struts across the stage, and raises an eyebrow as she devises her murder scheme. She seems almost maniacal at times, and by the end of the scene, we fear nothing more than becoming the object of her wrath, or worse, one of her conniving plots. Perez-Torres also delivers a touching performance as the tormented Othello. As he paces the stage, eyebrows furrowed, we sense his anxiety and the barely contained fury toward his wife, Desdemona.
The subtle costuming also adds interest to the show. While a majority of the cast is dressed in casual street-clothes, certain characters wear distinctive outfits. The fairies in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” wear light, embellished dresses that capture their seductive nature perfectly. In the two most serious scenes of the play, portraying the sins of “Wrath” and “Envy,” the characters are costumed in formal wear that enhances the austerity of the scene. The stiff feel of their outfits reminds us that we are not meant to feel at ease when watching these two tragic stories unfold.
Thus, while the play does encounter pitfalls in its structure, it is still a pleasure to watch. More importantly, it reminds us that it’s not improbable fiction at all to fall prey to the allure of the seven deadly sins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“SILENCE = DEATH” is the proclamation glowing on the lobby walls of the Carpenter Center these days. That slogan, writ under a pink triangle, was the icon that fueled a revolution in AIDS activism in New York 20 years ago. Now this historically significant image has resurfaced for “ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS Crisis, 1987-1993,” encouraging Harvard to speak up about AIDS and explore its relevance to the community. The exhibition marks the 20th anniversary of the formation of ACT UP New York as well as the premiere of the ACT UP Oral History Project, a collection of interviews with artists who were involved in the movement.
The preparation for “ACT UP New York” at Harvard—open from October 15 to December 23—has been fueled by the conviction that some things should be remembered and talked about, that some things shouldn’t remain silenced—the same conviction that began the ACT UP movement. By bringing an important and still pertinent historical moment into focus, “ACT UP” hopes to create a forum on campus wherein a greater dialogue about AIDS can take place.
STARTING UP
In the late 1980s, AIDS related death rates skyrocketed, causing a genuine crisis in American health care. Responding to the growing fear among citizens and the rising cases of illness, ACT UP sought to foster open public discussion.
“ACT UP was formed in 1987, and was probably the definitive social movement of my life, and also of my generation,” says Helen Molesworth, a co-curator of the exhibition and the Houghton Curator of Contemporary Art at the Harvard Art Museum. “It was a really important moment of social protest in our lifetime.”
During its first years, ACT UP became a widespread movement largely because its symbols were widely recognizable and eventually iconic. Deeply saturated with artists and the art, it functioned as a sort of visual, social initiative.
“The coalition of ACT UP was populated by artists and that was the case for a variety of things, including the simple fact of New York life in the 1980s,” says Claire Grace, co-curator and PhD student at Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture.
“The art world is filled with gay people,” Molesworth adds. “And gay men were really the first group of people who were hit by the disease.”
Realizing that they had a role to play, artists became more actively engaged in raising awareness about the crisis. “Those people brought all of their creative energy and their intellect to bear on this massive health crisis. They understood that in addition to acts of civil disobedience, they were also going to have to operate on another public sphere, and that was the sphere of images,” Molesworth says. “So they made t-shirts and stickers and posters that got pasted all over New York, and billboards, and bus advertisements and subway ads. There was a moment in New York when you just couldn’t be outside and not be experiencing some of the visual material coming out of ACT UP.”
Yet, even though the movement was so pervasive in its time, its history seems to have fallen out of the public eye. “I found that a lot of younger people did not know what ACT UP was,” says Molesworth, citing one of the reasons why she decided to put on the exhibition. “And I thought it was really curious that the history was so fragile that could be lost in perhaps a 20 year period.”
Despite its present invisibility, ACT UP, or AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, continues its work and remains relevant. The right to health care is one of its legacies, and a project that still resonates strongly today. And more locally, infection rates among men aged 18-35 are on a rise in Boston.
“Many of these images—their vitality and their message are really powerful and relevant to the current AIDS crisis that we face,” Grace says. “But their currency is dialed into a historical moment. You don’t see them on the streets anymore and that might be partly because our culture has changed a lot and it’s no longer as possible to be heard or to have your visual object resonate in this culture that we exist in.”
But “ACT Up New York,” will struggle valiantly against these conditions to create what they hope will be an active discussion on campus.
TEAM EFFORT
At Harvard, hardly anyone talks about AIDS. And what’s more, as of the first of August, the university ceased to provide anonymous HIV testing to students.
“People always assume that on campus we’re immune from HIV, we’re immune from sexually transmitted infections.” says Jia Hui Lee ’12, political chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies. “The reality is that we can’t assume that it doesn’t happen. These support systems are very, very important.”
In disseminating information about AIDS on campus, “ACT UP” seeks to reverse the policy, and the mentality that underlies it. “I think anonymous testing is something that needs to be available to students and to everyone,” Grace says. “I think it’s an important thing for the university to consider. Among other things that’s one of the shifts that I’m hoping to see happen.”
But in order for “ACT UP” to be more than just another exhibition and to actually affect such change, it needs to have a reach beyond the activist and artist community.  “One of the most wonderful things about this exhibition, and about visual arts in general, is that it can provide us with an opportunity to really strike at a topic from many different disciplinary perspectives. Because this is such an essential historical material and one that has really been lacking in popular consciousness now—or at least on campus—Helen saw really intently a need to have as broad a reach as possible,” Grace says.
As a result, the exhibition—a collaborative effort across the university—is supplanted by a variety of events, meant to appeal to audiences with a variety of interests, including symposiums hosted by Harvard University Center for AIDS Research, and one by the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
“We looked across the college and the university to see people who were working on AIDS/HIV,” says Molesworth. “And there are tons of people working on AIDS/HIV. So we thought the thing to do is to try to make this thing as interdisciplinary as possible. Because the movement was interdisciplinary.”
Just as the ACT UP movement naturally attracted a diverse group of people, so did this event. “We were approached by the Harvard Art Museum and specifically Claire, and met with them about the idea of collaboration,” says Stella Gukasayan, Program Coordinator at Harvard University Center for AIDS Research who is organizing one of the events. “Before they approached us to discuss that, Laura Bogart, a faculty who is part of the Harvard University Center for AIDS research, and I were working together to plan this HIV Denialism, Mistrust, and Stigma symposium. It just happened to be such a natural, organic mesh. It fit perfectly.”
The variety of subject is not the only way that the organizers made sure to appeal to a wide audience on campus. “ACT UP New York” involves students directly as well. “I got excited about the idea of students engaging in something as hard core and high profile as the Harvard Art Museum symposium,” says Trevor J. Martin ’10, who is putting on a performance art piece in conjunction with “ACT UP New York.” “It’s pretty much unprecedented for students to get really involved and really engage content-wise through the practice of art in symposiums.”
Students will also have the opportunity to work with members Fierce Pussy, an artist collective who were heavily involved in the movement and whose work will be featured in the exhibition, sponsored by the Women’s Center of Harvard College. “They did action art in order to wake up the culture and the society at the time to the AIDS crisis and to other issues related to AIDS including gender identity, construction, and explorations of how art, gender and sexuality intersect,” says Susan Marine, director of the Women’s Center of Harvard College. “We don’t have a lot of opportunities here for students to be directly involved with professional artists who are political in their work and who have politics in the centrality of their work, so to me it seems like a great opportunity to do that.”
STUDENTS ACT NOW
There are hopes that “ACT UP New York” will not only engage students but also inspire them to take action on what has come to be a fairly politically dormant campus. “After 9/11 our ability to be really critical of our government and to protest in public has been demonstrably curtailed,” Molesworth says. “This is a show that shows what happens when citizens insist that the government meet their needs. I guess I’m interested in sharing that history with people who haven’t seen that kind of thing in action.”
Some students have already taken on the challenge. Martha “Martabel” Wasserman ’10, who is a VES and Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrator, will be creating an exhibition catalogue as her senior thesis. “I think it’s really important to be able to show this event and story outside the Harvard community or people who are coming to the show,” Wasserman says.
Other students are participating in the creative aspect of the show. “It hit me that the students can use the ACT UP symposium as a platform where they can really take some artistic risks,” says Martin, who thinks the artistic handling of AIDS bears the situating of body in space. “My personal feeling is that the art students here and also the students interested in the arts really don’t take the same amount of risks even though we have more liberty to do so. I really wanted to latch onto this opportunity to do a performance piece with students at the symposium in the exhibition space, so that it can function as a gesture to the university but also the student body.”
It is, of course, not an easy task for students to get involved in symposiums such as “ACT UP New York” or to even find opportunities to exhibit one’s work. “It’s not a lack of motivation, or a lack of will to engage in political issues, it’s just the question of: where is the platform to do it?” Martin says.
However Martin hopes that student artists will be inspired by the resourcefulness and persistence of ACT UP, which found means of expression outside of traditional forums. “How can you make sure that the inspiration that the students will feel from this exhibition is going to carry forward? What’s going to happen after the symposium leaves? I don’t think these issues should be forgotten. Nor should the inspiration that one feels when they see how many risks people took to make this work, and also how resourceful the ACT UP members were,” Martin says. “I would really hope that students would take that as a model. You have something to say, you go out and find a way to say it. There is a means to meet that end, no matter how innovative or resourceful you have to be.”
SPEAKING OUT
“ACT UP New York” is an invitation to dialogue. “This exhibition is an invitation to go deeper and think about the political, social, and cultural components of the AIDS crisis, and the fact that it continues, and it’s not over,” Marine says.
Yet the very gesture of gathering visual media from the movement into a gallery is to fix ACT UP in time, and to soften its message that the AIDS crisis is ongoing.
“The fact of representing this exhibition as a historical moment is mixed for me,” Grace says.
Still whether or not “ACT UP New York” will impress the pertinence of the AIDS crisis upon the Harvard population, it serves as an important demonstration of the poignancy of the visual arts.
Citing a principle objective of the exhibition Grace says, “One of them is simply the understanding of the fact that collective organizing and its intersection with visual art can have a real effect on our culture, which is something that I think our generation, yours and mine, is not that in touch with, for whatever reason.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On September 26, “Saturday Night Live” started off its 35th season with a bang—or, more accurately, a bomb. In her first appearance on the show, as a biker chick who overuses the word “freaking,” featured player Jenny Slate accidentally said “fucking” on-air. This story has been blogged, reblogged, and re-reblogged ad infinitum over the last few weeks. It appeared in newspapers and magazines from “The New York Times” to “Entertainment Weekly,” and “Gawker” posted its first round of coverage at 1:19 a.m—a smooth turn-around on the 12:40 a.m. event. But should one phoneme make that much of a difference?
Many viewers speculated as to what sort of backlash “Saturday Night Live” and NBC could expect from the Federal Communications Commission. It was, after all, the FCC that levied a fine of $325,000 at the sight of Janet Jackson’s nipple during the 2004 Superbowl, though—who knows?—they might have been willing to knock down the price for the pair. It turns out, though, that in the so-called “safe harbor” period, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., television stations can technically air whatever profanity they like.
If what happened was perfectly legal, what’s the big deal? After all, none of the major news sources openly criticized Slate—instead, everyone seemed to be cringing, holding their breath and awaiting a statement from NBC. Weirdly enough, on the very next episode of “Saturday Night Live,” musical guest Lady Gaga didn’t bother to remove the word “shit” from the lyrics of her song “Paparazzi.” And almost no one cared. Of all the coverage of her “SNL” appearance, few stories acknowledged her verbal indiscretion. The reporters and bloggers that mentioned it did so only briefly in their mad rush to describe the kiss that Gaga shared with Madonna in a staged catfight sketch. Is it just me, or is the taboo of TV profanity starting to seem a little arbitrary?
Of course, the “F”-word doesn’t necessarily stand for “funny.” It’s not that we should allow profanity in television solely for naughtiness’ sake, but because it is something that, in reality, we use. Why are we so scandalized by something that so many of us say every day? The nature of Jenny’s mistake is itself telling. It wasn’t a purely mechanical speech error; she didn’t say “frogging” or “flocking.” She said “fucking” because she was thinking “fucking.” It makes sense—she’s primed for it, as is anyone else who would stay up till the early hours of the morning to watch “Saturday Night Live.”
This is not to say that we should encourage a generation of kids to grow up—as my mother might say—“effing” this and “essing” that, if only because that would be extremely unsettling. But in other countries, broadcast standards are more lax, without any evidence of a nationwide epidemic of depravity. In the United Kingdom, broadcasters must observe a similarly aquatic “watershed” time, from 9 p.m. to 5:30 a.m., but they’re not nearly so demure about it. There are popular British programs chock-full of F-words, S-words, and even C-words.
Even for the United States, NBC’s standards of decency are anomalously high. The Jenny Slate sketch aired almost concurrently with Comedy Central’s weekly “Secret Stash.” This block of R-rated films and stand-up comedy begins at 1 a.m. Sunday and offers all the letter-bombs you can imagine—and even, at times, partial nudity. Comedy Central has the decency to withhold their indecency until several hours into the safe harbor, but couldn’t any “SNL”-watching kid with cable get there with the push of a few buttons on his remote control? By the same token, only a very small number of minors saw Jenny’s mistake on television, but any 13-year-old with an Internet connection could easily bump into an uncensored YouTube video or transcript of the sketch.
There’s a lot of inconsistency when it comes to censorship. Some shows resort to “bleeping,” but you don’t have to be a proficient lip-reader to figure out what’s being said. Many of the most offensive things on television don’t need profanity or nudity to do their damage—I am continually astonished that “Mind of Mencia” hasn’t been cancelled.
When it comes to content, “Saturday Night Live” itself is certainly no angel. Think about the digital shorts, the “SNL” monster hits of recent years. “Jizz in My Pants” has accumulated over 65 million views on YouTube to date. Would you rather explain Slate’s mistake or the premise of that video to a 10-year-old? There’s a big difference between a slip of the tongue and a dick in a box.
Fortunately, it seems like Jenny Slate will be okay. Sharon Pannozzo, publicity director for NBC Universal, told “The New York Daily News” that there was “no truth” to rumors that she might be fired. Slate and fellow newbie Nasim Pedrad join the only two women who remain from last season’s cast: the brilliant Kristen Wiig and featured player Abby Elliott, known for her character, That Girl Who Isn’t Kristen Wiig. But more importantly, in addition to being female, she’s funny. Jenny Slate is half of Gabe & Jenny, the sketch comedy duo whose videos are some of the most bizarre and hilarious on the Internet. “SNL” can’t let her go over something this trivial.
So let’s relax about Slate’s mistake. It was, after all, a welcome break from mind-numbing host Megan Fox, and what is comedy but the manipulation of the unexpected? The taboo on cursing on television is outdated, a holdover from a more innocent time. Censorship? Fuck that shit.

For a play primarily about mathematics, “Proof” has a lot to say about the nature of human existence. “It very much looks at the fine line between brilliance and insanity,” says director Kriti Lodha ’12. David Auburn’s Pulitzer-Prize winning drama is being performed at the Loeb Experimental Theater through tomorrow in an effort to bring the play’s relevance to campus. “Being here [at Harvard], I’ve met so many interesting characters,” says Lodha, who is also a Crimson magazine editor, “that it makes me think that this is so appropriate.”
“Proof” centers on Catherine, the brilliant but unbalanced daughter of an even more brilliant and unbalanced mathematician, Robert. Upon Robert’s death, Hal, one of his graduate students, discovers a groundbreaking proof on his desk, which Catherine claims she wrote. The question of the proof’s authorship and Catherine’s burgeoning relationship with Hal dominate the plot of the play, amongst Catherine’s struggles over her father’s recent death and her fears about inheriting his insanity. The title thus takes on additional meaning. “The idea of the proof is her [Catherine] very much trying to prove, to herself more than anyone else, that she is okay and that she’s going to be okay,” Lodha says.
“There are all different levels of people having to prove themselves to each other,” says Caroline R. Giuliani ’11, who plays Catherine. “Some are very literal, but others are about proving that they’re going to be there for you later when you’re crazy, because Catherine is a very emotionally unstable character who tests her relationships with people.”
The play takes the form of a series of vignettes spread through time, and actors and director agree that the plot takes a back seat to the characters and their interactions.
“Each scene has its own story, its own arc. When you throw them all together it creates a story, but each of them has its own individual thing... The show is much more about the relationships that come up in each scene,” says Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13, who plays Hal.
Robert C. Rogers, an HRDC alum who works in the Harvard Math department and has acted off-Broadway in New York, returns to the stage after a multi-year hiatus to play Robert. Rogers and his character have more in common than just an interest in math. “My own father was not exactly like Robert, but he suffered very much from mental illness,” says Rogers. “Some of the stuff Catherine has to do for Robert during the play, I had to do for my father. You always choose roles that help you work through feelings you never quite got through in your real life.”
The personal relevance of some of the play’s themes helps the cast members of “Proof” make the play their own. During its numerous theatrical and cinematic iterations, “Proof” has featured a range of marquee names, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Catherine in the film version and Neil Patrick Harris as Hal on Broadway. To produce a unique version of “Proof,” some of the actors have avoided investigating other versions. “If you go trying to catch up with the big name people you’re always going to fall short,” says Nee-Vogelman. “You have to approach it in a different way.”
Lodha admits the show’s popularity puts some constraints on her ability to experiment, but these haven’t bothered her. “Anything that’s consistent between the shows, I realized I didn’t want to change it,” she says. To avoid creating a carbon copy of previous productions, Lodha is utilizing some unusual staging as well as playing up the introspective aspects of Auburn’s original vision, which she feels sometimes get submerged in other productions.
The fact that the show’s run has already sold out is an indication of its fame and also of its thematic appropriateness to this academic setting. “We really wanted to reach out and branch out beyond the typical theatergoers,” Lodha said. “There is something interesting in the convergence of mathematics and theater. What’s very interesting about this show is taking something that seems like two polar opposites and showing that there isn’t that much of a difference after all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dancer, actress, and choreographer—Helen Pickett is a sensation in the world of ballet. For over a decade, she held the position of principal dancer in famed choreographer William Forsythe’s Ballet Frankfurt. Her newest piece, “Tsukiyo (Moonlit Night),” which was commissioned by Boston Ballet director Mikko Nissinen, considers the complexities of human interaction in the setting of a Japanese fairy tale. The Office for the Arts’ Dance Program will bring Pickett to campus today at 7 p.m. to discuss the upcoming world premiere of her piece, which debuts next Thursday.
The Harvard Crimson: Is there a general story or theme that plays out through “Tsukiyo?”
Helen Pickett: Mikko and I talked about a duet, and he expressed that he would like to have a Japanese theme to the duet. I went to a piece of music that I have liked for a very long time by Arvo Pärt, called “Sciegel im Sciegel,” and that’s the bulk of the duet.
I found this fairy tale called “The Woodcutter’s Daughter,” which I decided I liked the best, because it has an ethereal quality. I knew that I wanted to do a duet about relationships—the questions of, “‘How does someone approach someone else in any situation?” “What are the boundaries?” “How do people let each other in?” With the ethereal quality, there is a built-in boundary—there is one person who is going to be of this world and one person who is not of this world.
THC:  In addition to being a performer and choreographer, you are also an actress and a dance teacher. Have acting and teaching added to your own style of dance and choreography in any way?
HP: Definitely. One of the big ways acting has helped me in choreography is how I approach the dancers. I make them describe what they could be feeling. I think it is a very important process for a dancer because for the most part we do not use our voices on stage. I have also learned from my acting that stories are very important to me.
As far as teaching, it has helped my coaching: teaching someone about finding something new within himself or the technical aspect of what’s happening. Writing also helps me in coaching. It allows me to describe in a different way, using punctuation—this is a period in your movement, or a comma instead of a breath, or an explanation point to explain that this needs to come out stronger. As much imagery as one can use in the dance world, the better, because it gives people a focal point.
THC: Many of your dance seminars focus on improvisation in dance. Could you explain how improvisation helps to improve a dancer’s abilities?
HP: I really believe in structured improvisation, that technique can set you free. I believe that the improvisation that I teach can teach students or dancers to know their bodies better. Your body is your instrument, so the more you can know about it, the greater you can investigate. Improvisation is very important in this day and age because every ballet company is doing neo-classical and contemporary work, and the boundaries are being blurred more and more in dance. If we are producing ballet dancers that do not know about improvisation, we are producing ballet dancers that are going to be part of a dying art. If we get this improvisation out there, making these young people more curious about what their bodies are capable of, then perhaps we will produce the next great choreographer.
THC: On Friday night you will take part in Harvard Dance Center’s “Boston Ballet Dance Talk.” What do you hope the audience will take away from the night’s performance and discussion?
HP: I want to spark their curiosity to come see the piece. I will be showing sections of the piece and going into why I chose to show these sections. I also want to hear their responses and what they might take from the specific section I show them. I would like to have an intellectual conversation about an emotional content. If it has moved them, I would like to know why.
Also, I will show them the same section with three different casts. I would like them to take away that each individual person brings something to the same choreography, and to see that the art lies in the individual.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Look both ways before crossing the street.” So goes the common traffic adage and so begins Ilya Ilf and Evgeny Petrov’s 1931 opus, “The Golden Calf.” It’s simple enough to be disregarded as a joke, but its relevance permeates the story. With a perfect mesh of timeless wit and political metaphor, “The Golden Calf” is a comedic classic, the recent translation of which only serves to emphasize its timelessness.
Ilf and Petrov weave the story of the citizen’s crimes of stupidity with anti-Soviet sentiments, and they deftly use their cast of criminals to get away with it. The instant satisfaction of the characters’ crimes and the rapid dissolution of the rewards therein stand as an allegorical base for the Bolsheviks, who took power only six years before “The Golden Calf” was written. Through the use of undesirables and thieves, the authors are free to digress about their dream of capitalism’s return. The introduction of cremation to the USSR during this time allowed people to laugh about death, making it tangible and giving death a strange residue; similarly, capitalist thieves allowed people to laugh about socialism.
“The Golden Calf” alternates points of view among a wide array of people—artists, office clerks, riddlers, poets, madmen, accountants, Catholic priests, authors and photographers—while concentrating its plot on the work of a band of thieves. The story focuses on four of these thieves; they are conspiring to rob and bring to ruin their associate, the malevolent Korieko, who, it just so happens, is a secret millionaire—an “underground Rockefeller.”
The thief Ostap emerges as the unlikely hero, the leader of the new band of thieves and the mastermind behind their agenda. But like all unlikely heroes, he runs into a long bout of bad luck. Ostap inadvertently ruins the rally and is chased down for it; he is poisoned by Koreiko; his partner, Panikovsky accidently reveals his master plan; and his house burns down—all leaving him one step farther from his dream of the a million dollars.
Ilf and Petrov wear their erudition on their sleeves in “The Golden Calf.” The novel is filled with cues from high and low culture—colorful and referential insults, classical literature, and cosmopolitan knowhow. One pretend madman, exercising freedom of speech as his alter ego declares, “Et tu, Brute, sold out the Bolsheviks!” The novel also takes particular interest in allusions to “The Brothers Karamazov,” and at one point Ostap conflates the story of Jason’s Golden Fleece with the titular (and Biblical) Golden Calf.
Yet, the book is essentially a product of the Bolshevik Revolution, and the culture of regimented pomp with which the Soviets came to be associated. In a telegram to his nemesis, Ostap says, “I am commanding parade,” invoking the frequent and spectacular displays of public military prowess in Soviet cities. Just like Ostap, the book demands the reader’s undivided attention. The novel’s content is humorous, but it remains reflective of the Soviet philosophy of living: one long procession of change comprised of marchers doomed to parade around en masse, doing little of any meaning, bereft of any individuality.
“The Golden Calf” succeeds with well-placed humor that’s constantly in dialogue with (and occasionally mocking of) its high intellectual standard. The facetious nature of the hero will have readers laughing out loud more than once: “The angels want to come down to earth now. It’s nice down here: we have municipal services, the planetarium. You can watch the stars and listen to an anti-religious lecture all at once,” Ostap says.
In the translators’ notes, it is mentioned that much of the humor that applied in Russian, does not work in English. Much of the wordplay and ridiculous names have been lost, yet the translators demonstrated incredible skill at bringing the non-idiomatic humor to the surface of the novel at all times.
Some of the novel’s most charming aspects are the truths that are nonchalantly ferreted out. Even in the 1930s, “One needs to point out that there isn’t a young woman in the whole world who doesn’t sense an upcoming declaration of love at least a week in advance.” It’s true. It is also true that criminals are less stingy than the gluttonous rich. The book makes the comparison that those with “large modern day fortunes [that] were amassed through the most dishonest means” are as bad as stingy smokers that refuse to offer their whole pack lest someone takes more than one.
While deconstructing the dynamics of the Soviet foundation, “The Golden Calf,” tacitly advocates the life of capitalism. At one point, Ostap even says of a parcel, “Inside, there’s everything: palms, girls, the Blue Express, the azure ocean, a white ship, a barely used tuxedo, a Japanese butler, your own pool table, platinum teeth, socks with no holes, dinners cooked with real butter, but most importantly, my little friends, the power and fame that come with money.” Their scheme is the key to something that sounds uncannily similar to the American Dream.
“Parallel to the big world inhabited by big people and big things, there’s a small world with small people and small things.” Ilf and Petrov may have diminished along with the history of the Soviet Union, but this new translation ensures that though they may be apart of a small world, they won’t be forgotten.

“Freedom had hit Russia like a great slap, and people were still reeling from the shock,” Irakli Iosebashevili writes of the mood among Muscovites in 1993 in his short story “The Life and Times of a Soviet Capitalist.” The authors of the essays and vignettes collected in “The Wall in My Head: Words and Images from the Fall of the Iron Curtain” agree on few things, but on this subject they find common ground: the world changed in 1989, and the peoples of the former Soviet Republics were wholly unprepared.
“The Wall in My Head,” whose release marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, is an eclectic anthology, composed of excerpts from previously published novels by authors like Milan Kundera and Victor Pelevin, previously unpublished short stories and essays by Peter Esterhazy and Uwe Tellkamp, among others, as well as art and photographs from artists including Walter Gaudnek and Brian Rose.
The written portions investigate the Soviet Union and its collapse from most every geographical, social and ideological perspective. But the collection’s subtitle is misleading. “The Wall in My Head” isn’t a meditation on the end of communism in the Soviet Bloc, but its history entire—its successes, its failures, and its absurdities. Thought-provoking, oddly nostalgic, and ultimately inconclusive, “The Wall in My Head” is a worthy investigation of a way of life which, for all its flaws, found a place in the hearts and minds of millions.
The book begins by openly challenging the model for daily life in the Soviet Union in a series of stories that emphasize the various shortcomings and irrationalities of the Soviet regime. “Paris Lost” by Wladimir Kaminer is the account of a counterfeit Paris, built by the Soviet government as part of a program to supposedly send some of the nation’s most productive workers on a free vacation to the European center of culture. Of course, they couldn’t possibly do this in reality—after all, capitalist temptations were lying in wait to seduce and entrap those good Communist citizens. Instead, the Soviet government chose to “build their own ‘Abroad’ in the Steppes of southern Russia, near Stavropol, with a real city, and many inhabitants,” a charade which lasted until a foreign journalist got hold of the story.
An extract from “Omon Ra” by Victor Pelevin takes an even bleaker outlook. The drunken narrator comes to realize that “the entire immense country in which [he] lived was made up of lots and lots of these lousy little closets where there was a smell of garbage and people had just been drinking cheap port,” an acknowledgment of the tedium and squalidness of quotidian life in the Soviet Union. Other stories critique the endless, labyrinthine bureaucracy and the culture of mistrust, where civilians spy on their fellow citizens.
But “The Wall In My Head” is by no means an indictment of communism. On the contrary, several of the stories and essays seem to almost pine for its simplicity and order. One of the finest essays in the collection, “Farewell to the Queue,” by Vladimir Sorokin, uses queues as a metaphor for the togetherness and order of Soviet society—a “quasi-surrogate for church,” which taught obedience while giving people time to ponder the advantages of socialism. In his view, the market economy replaced order with chaos, collectiveness with competition, simplicity with complexity; it replaced the queue with the crowd. “The ordeal of the free market,” writes Sorokin, “turned out to be more frightening than the Gulag... because it forced people to part with the oneiric space of collective slumber, forced them to leave the ideally balanced Stalinist cosmos behind.”
In “The Life and Times of a Soviet Capitalist,” a gangster friend of the titular character joins his family for dinner. He too, finds something lacking in the new, disorderly capitalist system. “In all of its history, Georgia never did so well as it did during Communist times,” he declares. “Everyone had their piece of bread... I hated the communists. But look at what people have to go through now. You think what they have in Georgia is freedom? Being able to eat, that’s freedom.”
Finally, the collection confronts the issue suggested by its title—the fall of the Iron Curtain. The Berlin Wall itself is best introduced in an excerpt from “The Wall Jumper” by Peter Schneider, a one-time student activist in 1960s Berlin. Against expectations, the wall is not presented as some overbearing, malignant force. Schneider instead tells the story of two boys who routinely jumped the wall in order to see films only available on the Western side, before returning home to the East (and even refusing, on one occasion, a direct offer to stay). Anyone who has visited the Berlin Wall’s remains will know that this story is rather fanciful, but its inclusion is an interesting insight into the patchwork portrait of life behind the Iron Curtain that “The Wall in My Head” is attempting to build.
Mostly, “The Wall in My Head” is about communism and the people who lived under it—not when it collapsed under its own weight, but when it threatened to become the world’s dominant form of government. The authors of the anthology, as disparate in their ideologies as in their backgrounds, reach no conclusions. They make few grand claims about communism as a system of government. To some extent, the lack of some overarching statement or idea is frustrating, but it simultaneously feels just. Instead of prescribing a specific view, “The Wall in My Head” makes the reader think, reconsider, and question accepted wisdom.
According to journalist Gleb Pavlovsky, the collection provides an answer to the question “Where from?” Without this answer, he believes, the people of Eastern Europe will be unable to answer another question: “Where to?” For citizens of post-Soviet states, “The Wall in My Head” provides a new avenue for understanding their past.

Once unremarkable, the formerly bleak JFK Street staircase into the basement of The Garage now leads to the new performance space of one of the most interesting theatrical experiences in Boston: the Actors’ Shakespeare Project.
The Project, which kicked off its sixth season on Wednesday with “The Taming of the Shrew,” is a local theater company dedicated entirely to intimate and engaging productions of Shakespeare’s plays. Unlike many companies who operate out of one theatre, the Project’s productions crop up in unexpected locales, bringing the spirit of Shakespeare to myriad unconventional spaces. These temporary theatres foster an intimate connection between the players and the audience and work to eliminate the common stigmas of inaccessibility and intellectualism that surround Shakespeare.
“I have been really struck by a couple of experiences I had had both as an audience member in the theatre seeing a couple of Shakespeare productions in this very intimate space… I’d seen a lot of Shakespeare that I’d enjoyed, but I’d always felt on the outside of it,” says Benjamin Evett, the Project’s Founding Artistic Director. “In these experiences I really felt a depth, clarity, and power that I hadn’t experienced, and I was really anxious to give that experience to other people in Boston.”
For “The Taming of the Shrew,” The Project began renting the basement of The Garage about a month ago. The space has since been rebuilt as a theatre—with lighting, dressing rooms, a space for the audience, and a set based on the oft-overlooked induction to “The Taming of the Shrew.” The play itself deals with the unrealizable love of Lucentio for Bianca and Petruchio’s attempts to tame the obstinate object of his affection, Katherine, the titular “shrew.” The induction, though, establishes the story as a play within a play; a drunkard is subjected to a cruel trick that convinces him he is a lord, and the rest of the play is performed by actors commissioned by the trick’s perpetrator to indulge the drunkard’s fantasy.
“I was looking for a setting that would be a slightly down-and-out sleazy bar,” says the show’s director, Melia Bensussen, “and the basement of The Garage has given us the opportunity to transform it into a kind of funky out-of-the-way bar.”
In using the induction, the Project believes that makes “The Taming of the Shrew” more accessible; the play within the play takes place in Padua, but by setting this production in the tavern shown during the induction, the Project brings the show onto more familiar ground, which is enhanced by the remote feel of The Garage’s basement.
The constant process of relocation with each new show aids the Project’s driving mission to spread Shakespeare’s insight and power by bringing his works to communities that possess few opportunities for local performance.
“We’re really interested in getting young people into the theatre,” Evett says. “We think that our particular approach to these plays does make them accessible in a way that doesn’t condescend… or reduce the integrity of the play but actually informs it, in a way.”
Driven by a commonly held belief in Shakespeare’s position as the greatest playwright of all time, the Project is unwavering in its conviction that, despite their mission to fundamentally change the way his plays are presented, the man’s work is eternally and transcendentally significant.
“It’s like going back to basics again and again and again to figure out what makes us tick,” says Allyn Burrows, the current Artistic Director. “The mechanics of the writing are such that they tap into the human heartbeat. If you look at iambic pentameter, that’s the same sound that a human heart makes.”
Through several educational programs based around theater and Shakespeare, the Project counters the persisting belief that Shakespeare’s works are inapplicable to modern times with a focus on the ways that the themes and the language of the plays tap into essentially human issues. “Even though he talks about sweeping things,” Evett says, “what he really understands better than any other writer is the intimate, personal struggles between people.”
Popular adaptations of “The Taming of the Shrew”—“Kiss Me Kate” or “Ten Things I Hate About You”—emphasize the opinion that the play is a portrait of misogyny and a comedic study of gender relations—one that continues to entertain. “We never grow tired of looking at how men and women fight and fall in love,” Evett says. But he and the Project see even more relevant themes beneath that.
“Kate’s journey is about figuring out how to play nice with others, and that’s not something that she does naturally,” Bensussen says. “With this cultural moment and this presidency, we’re looking for civility in discourse and we want to find a vocabulary for collaboration and not obstinacy, and the play speaks to that in that it can create harmony in that way.”
In this production of “The Taming of the Shrew,” the Project will endeavor to prove yet again the sustained cultural and human relevance of Shakespeare’s works.
“Shakespeare has done so much that every generation is compelled to reinterpret him because of the characters, the power of his stories and the deep understanding he has of human nature.” Evett says. “He transcends time. There are a lot of great plays out there—a lot of great plays. But there’s nothing like Shakespeare.”

For the past century, no truths have been more bizarre, or more infamously difficult to conceptualize, than those of quantum mechanics. Its predictions have been verified to an accuracy that far exceeds any other physical theory ever developed, and yet, some of the greatest thinkers ever to have lived—even Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger, pioneers of the theory—had difficulty accepting the phenomenal implications of interpreting the theory’s mathematical formalism. Richard Feynman, the charismatic second generation quantum physicist, famously quipped, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” It is no easy task, then, for the writer without a considerable scientific background to intelligently and meaningfully engage with it.
The most explicit attempt to address QM in literature can be found in Michael Frayn’s play “Copenhagen,” which imagines and reimagines the enigmatic meeting between physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in the Nazi-occupied Denmark of 1941. Heisenberg was working on the Nazi nuclear project (either on a bomb or a reactor—we still don’t know); Bohr was a Dane, and would later flee due to his Jewish ancestry. The meeting ended badly, and the two, once the best of friends, never spoke again.
The play is an admirable attempt to integrate science and literature, but it quickly descends into an endless pun about uncertainty—as in Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle—which the play itself never quite cognizes. The work suffers from an overabundance of mere observations of the ways human behavior can correspond with anthropomorphic interpretations of QM. This method is inherently problematic; the physics can really only tell us the outcomes of experiments concerning the quantum world. At best it allows room to imagine what subatomic particles do, but that has nothing to do with what humans do.
The art world more successfully engaged with relativity, QM’s better-behaved older brother. While concepts like warped space-time are hardly possible to visualize, its effects are easier to understand. When the theory became famous in 1919, it had a significant effect on the art world (see Kandinsky circa the 1920s). The way the theory forced us to reconsider our everyday concepts of space and time radically altered our renderings of them through art.
QM, on the other hand, firstly is impossible to visualize, and secondly doesn’t really alter our conceptions of such everyday things. What it talks about are things that have nothing to do with our everyday experience. Relativity explains why apples fall from trees onto physicists’ heads, why the year divides into warmth and cold—perennial questions. QM resolves relatively esoteric problems, and its subject matter is neither planets nor ballistics, but rather subatomic particles. It admittedly alters our conception of causality, though not as significantly as an artist might desire. All in all, it describes a world that has nothing—absolutely nothing—to do with our everyday experiences.
What QM does have, however, is the word, “uncertainty.” Uncertainty is a mathematical relation between certain pairs of measurable qualities, like position and momentum. It says that if you can measure X to within a degree of certitude, then the maximum certitude you can get for Y is a function of the certitude for X. As a consequence of wave-particle duality, you can’t measure both quantities as accurately as you want to. What this means epistemologically and metaphysically is perpetually up for debate.
Uncertainty, in its more general usage, is something with which literature is far more intimate. We’re all aware of our own incomplete knowledge and inability to divine the future. This is the very motivation for physics in the first place. And the word forms the core of perhaps the most accurate and beautiful conception of poetics—John Keats’s “Negative Capability”: “when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.” I believe that herein rests the trap of “quantum literature”: the purposeful conflation of Keats’s and Heisenberg’s uncertainties.
This is exactly where Frayn’s play (which, for the record, I enjoyed) fails. “Copenhagen” outlines an “irritable reaching after fact & reason” as Bohr and Heisenberg search to accurately reconstruct their fateful meeting. But every time they get one part of the story down, another part becomes immeasurable—pseudo-uncertainty relations. The play ends with nothing resolved, the characters having accepted the “uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts.” But it’s a stretch.
Negative capability has nothing to do with the Uncertainty Principle. Uncertainty is the product of a great deal of the most “irritable reaching after fact & reason” the world has ever seen, and has contributed to our most accurate physical theory to date. Heisenberg’s uncertainty, both the consequence and the cause of much “reaching after fact & reason,” is antithetical to Keats’s.
I’m not saying that QM doesn’t have a place in literature. On the contrary, I’m afraid that literature has not yet adequately engaged with some of our strangest and most delightful mysteries. Instead, it’s gone remarkably astray in the hopes creating spaces from which to exercise negative capability.
In Jorie Graham’s poem “Europe,” the speaker wanders present-day Omaha Beach watching children make sand castles when her thoughts turn to subatomic particles. Yet she renders the scientific images in themselves, with no pretension to metaphor or conceit, even issuing a warning: “Don’t seek. It is not open to seeking.” The ambiguity of the scientific fact’s actual connection with one’s life resonates the poem into a deeper emotional plane. This is negative capability. The beauty of science lies in and of itself, and the artist’s job is to present it as is, a strange result of reason and perception, and how we are unsure of just what it means to us that the world is as it is.

The Flaming Lips are an American musical institution, and they may be the last of their kind. Not that this sort of thing ever came around so often, or even that there was more than one like them to begin with. Wayne Coyne and his merry band of psychic minstrels have wandered the earth together for nearly 30 years, and in that time they’ve produced 12 studio albums, 2 documentaries and a feature film; they’ve ridden the crest of approximately three musical waves; and they’ve recorded exactly one song­—Okla. state rock song “Do You Realize??”—whose sheer transcendence has insured the band immortality beyond all possible contingency.
Like the Grateful Dead, that other storied American collective, the Flaming Lips are the residue of a revolutionary and long-outmoded turning point in popular music: the Dead had the psychedelic era; the Lips had punk rock. Both bands derive their sound from a host of intersecting genres and traditions: the Dead had blues, country, and folk; the Lips have punk, pop, and space rock. But unlike the Dead, or any other group of comparable longevity, the Flaming Lips have fashioned a legacy through constant rejuvenation. Their greatest albums—1993’s “Transmissions from the Satellite Heart,” 1999’s “The Soft Bulletin,” and now 2009’s “Embryonic”—have all been the culmination of a radical change in sound and direction.
This is what made the band’s 2004 release, “At War With The Mystics,” such a frustrating album. Anyone familiar with the band’s two previous albums—“The Soft Bulletin” and 2002’s “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots”—will be able to point to the myriad recycle tropes that propped that record up. “Mystics” attempts to craft simpler, theoretically catchier—and typically somewhat monotonous—pop songs with the same sort of thematic import that made the elegant, orchestral, deeply emotive “Yoshimi” standout “Do You Realize??” such a runaway hit. Instead, it oversimplified the formula, leaving even the catchiest of those songs relatively limp.
So with their relevance as innovators hanging in the balance, the Flaming Lips deliver their latest effort in the nick of time. “Embryonic” challenges in a way that nothing of their latter-day output since 1997’s “Zaireeka”—the infamous 4-CD album whose simultaneous playing allegedly replicates quadraphonic sound—had ever aspired. It’s also the first since that album to lack a substantive point of reference in the band’s earlier catalogue. “Embryonic” is an anomaly, and while its uniqueness alone doesn’t denote quality, the album provides enough muscle and musical clout to make the sonic shift more than justified.
Opener “Convinced of the Hex” immediately grounds the album in totally foreign territory for Flaming Lips fans. Bass-heavy, rife with corrosive guitar licks and polyrhythmic percussion, the song features a spaced-out—and for the first time, restrained—vocal performance from Coyne. He’s still speaking his own half-cracked pseudo-religious language, but it’s obvious from the beginning that, for the first time in a long time, lyrics don’t matter very much to the Flaming Lips. The downright raucous “Aquarius Sabotage,” a sort of ecstatic surf-rock jam, equipped with glockenspiel and an orchestral coda, raises the paradox as its thesis: the Flaming Lips want their bull and their china shop too. The sonic center of the album, “Powerless,” is a sinister instrumental piece over which guitarist Steve Drozd erratically improvises, to an effect at turns intense and enervating. But the most thrilling moment of “Embryonic” is towards its end—the signature-switching “Silver Trembling Hands,” whose punk-tempo framework balances gorgeously with a slow-motion release and refrain. At an hour and ten minutes, “Embryonic” has enough high points that potential favorites abound.
“Embryonic,” for all its surprises, fits logically within the Lip’s ethic—its existence as a double album that insists on a total listening experience is anachronistic in the way the band is known for. Whether this plays to the strengths of the new material is up for debate—there are certainly moments that are lost in the continuum. It’s unclear whether those more sedate tracks like “Evil,” “If” and “Sagittarius Silver Announcement”—which are transitional in the way that previous albums’ instrumental tracks were—are engaging or expendable. Production remains consistently eclectic throughout, raising the question as to whether certain songs even make sense divorced from the body of “Embryonic.”
The spacious, lush, and shockingly dark production values on “Embryonic” comprise the only substantive lens through which comparisons to earlier material can be made. The sheer level of studio precision involved in crafting these songs—feedback and percussion loops, vocal layering, electronic flourishes—can’t escape a comparison to the techniques that brought “The Soft Bulletin” to life. But the relationship between the two records is almost totally inverted: while “The Soft Bulletin” brought a cinematic—at times even an operatic—sensibility to its structure, emphasizing the individual track as an autonomous episode within a greater, looser narrative, “Embryonic” reverts the energy of the single track toward a teleology that is itself the album-whole. It’s dense, menacing, and groove-oriented in a way that reminds the listener of the Talking Heads’ “Remain in Light,” an album whose individual tracks tend to be lost, or at least less potent, outside the framework of the album proper. In this way, “Embryonic” could be the paranoiac subconscious of any one of the passengers aboard ship of fools that was “The Soft Bulletin.” It remains an open question as to whether the choice not to produce with David Friedman—known for his work in psych-rock band Mercury Rev—for the first time since 1989’s “Telepathic Surgery” allowed for this sudden burst of inspiration from the band.
But the comparisons do little to prove what’s already apparent—the Flaming Lips have made their first truly important record in a decade, and whether it meets expectations, perverts them, or annihilates them completely, “Embryonic” stands as yet another milestone for the veterans of the alternative rock aftermath: that of the difficult masterpiece.

Seminal noise rock duo Lightning Bolt—bassist Brian Gibson and drummer Brian Chippendale—play their bone-crunching live shows on the floor of whatever venue is crazy enough to allow it, using only volume to push back the churning crowd of future tinnitus patients that surrounds them. Fueled by Gibson’s two refrigerator-sized speaker cabs pumping out over three thousand watts of distorted bass alongside Chippendale’s drumstick-shattering rhythms, Lightning Bolt’s elusive concerts—frequently announced only days or hours in advance—are an unforgettable experience.
With these primal, high-energy shows that have made them legendary, it’s understandable that Lightning Bolt’s studio efforts have often been overshadowed by their (non-)stage presence. The duo’s    albums have historically been defined, and occasionally limited, by their relationship to the incomparable concerts they put on.
Lightning Bolt recorded the bulk of their eponymous debut in a studio, but before the album’s release decided to scrap the meticulously-recorded studio cuts in favor of live 4-track recordings. The result was what one would expect when condensing a room full of pummeling drums and gut-wrenching bass amplifiers down to anemic laptop speakers, tinny iPod headphones, or muddy home stereos: while it reminded a lucky few of that crazy show they saw in a dirty Providence loft, to the rest of us it sounded underpowered and underwhelming. Subsequent releases improved the recording quality, but still sought to capture the spontaneity of a live show, using very little production and emphasizing improvisation over formal composition.
“Earthly Delights,” the duo’s fifth LP, reflects the completion of Lightning Bolt’s transition from grasping at their elusive live sound to crafting a full-fledged studio album. The differences from 2005’s “Hypermagic Mountain” are small but significant, taking the band beyond mere reproduction of a live show. The wider sonic range afforded by proper mic placement and high-end recording equipment gives bassist Brian Gibson’s densely layered effects a bit of breathing room, revealing a textural intricacy that is lost in live performance. On “The Sublime Freak”, Gibson’s feedback-soaked bass rattles the hi-hat before diving into a riff as catchy as you can expect from the borderline noise that is Lightning Bolt. Multiple effects chains are audible above Chippendale’s machine gun drumming, and the latter half of the track features multi-tracking that would have been unthinkable in the band’s early days. The result is a thick tangle of dissonance that can hardly be traced to the single, humble vibrating string from which it emerged.
It’s hard to believe that Gibson’s signature sonic texture comes from a single instrument, but more surprising than the density of Gibson’s tone is the wide range of atmospheres he and Chippendale manage to evoke with their limited palette. The intro to “Flooded Chamber” is crafted from loops of pitch-shifted feedback, coalescing into a mournful seagull cry above Chippendale’s skittering ADD drums. “Rain on Lake I’m Swimming In” is a wash of echoed, harmonized bass melody underneath whimsical, indecipherable processed vocals. Both of these tracks show a marked deviation from the duo’s relentless riffage without sacrificing their signature sound.
With their simple two-instrument setup perfected, the Brians are able to turn their attention towards the fundamental elements of songwriting: motivic development, the rise and fall of tension, and yes, even melody. Tracks like “Funny Farm” show a more formal arrangement, with clearly identifiable call-and-response patterns providing structure to a genre that often lapses into shapelessness.
The compositional techniques guiding each song’s overall development can also be heard on a micro level, with constant subtle variations on otherwise repetitive riffs. This is most evident in Chippendale’s frenetic drumming, which offloads much of its traditional duty as repetitive time-keeper to Gibson’s chunky, rhythmic bass. Chippendale is thus free to play as a soloist in a jazz combo, exploring every possible subdivision and inversion of the dominant rhythmic motif. The drums in “Nation of Boar” heighten tension as they increase in complexity, reaching a frantic virtuosic peak before lunging back into a pounding 4/4 rhythm.
“Earthly Delights” marks Lightning Bolt’s emergence as a fully competent studio act. It is a career landmark, if not their pinnacle, suggesting multiple potential directions for the band: imitate their current successes ad infinitum, explore radically different territory, or walk the delicate line of career innovators such as Sonic Youth and Radiohead. Lightning Bolt has defined their territory and explored its every facet, and “Earthly Delights” is the perfection of their current form.

A 10-years younger Shakira appears on the cover of “¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?”—the Spanish-language album that fixed for a permanent star in the global pop stratosphere—in dark dreads and muddied hands. Her face is simply made-up and her gaze inquisitive and earnest. The album’s title appears to be handwritten.
A very different Shakira is pictured on the album art of “She Wolf,” though its structure is precisely the same—a simple portrait of the artist directly facing the listener. On “She Wolf,” her hair is Brigitte Bardot, all tousled and blonde, spilling over deeply smoked eyes. The lips are an unsubtle fuchsia, slightly parted as though in invitation. Her bodice dips low and reveals flesh that is too glowing and flawless not to be heavily airbrushed. The image is easy on the ojos, to be sure, but also too easy artistically. There was something poetic about the imperfect image on “¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?”, to go along with the suffering and quirky songs. On the cover of “She Wolf,” she is not a poetess but a poetette, little more than a two-bit Britney.
This is a shame. Shakira has ever been the thinking man’s Britney (though not too deeply thinking), several steps above the impoverished dregs of robotized glamour-pop. What set her apart were her siren vocals, and the lyrics those vocals would belt out—lyrics crafted by a fledgling English speaker, peculiar and sometimes puzzling. She is still thankfully in ownership of these gifts, singing lines like “Why wait for later? / I’m not a waiter” and using words like “lycanthropy” (destined to be among the most-searched definitions on Google this month). But the album is mostly uninspired and frenetically overproduced. Shakira manages just barely to keep afloat over the wash of clubby electro-pop, but her barge is not a secure one and tends to sink.
This pleasure-cruise, a disco boat for all-night dancing hosted by a funny Colombian in a belly shirt, goes under on such songs as “Why Wait.” It opens excitingly enough, with five counts of electronic pulsing reminiscent of the beginning to Kelis’s “Milkshake,” but quickly grows tiresome. The faux-Arabian exotica to which the singer is so devoted as a reminder of her Lebanese heritage explains its expected appearance here, but adds little. Neither is the voice as convincing on this track as in her past music, meandering listlessly, as bare of feeling as the droning machine drumbeat supporting it.
The song’s theme, one of sexual heat and animal yearning, is the predominant one of the album. This sentiment is of course nothing new from Shakira—the video of 2005’s “La Tortura” found her writhing in black oil—but it is disappointing that so few tracks here stray from the boudoir. A she wolf, after all, does more than lust. Could she not have explored the implications of traveling in a pack, or the “endangered species” of the songwriting chanteuse? These are questions the album does not care to answer.
When she does delve into the figure of the she wolf, on the album’s title track, Shakira is at her most successful. It begins with a halting, funky bass line, builds with high-pitched tones like signals from a groovy erotic spaceship, and ends with strings, dramatic and glorious. All this as she sings, pants, and howls, making everyone happy. It attains something close to a pop symphony, and while the drop from “She Wolf” to the rest of the songs on the album is a perilously steep one, at least this peak grazes the very moon and comes dressed in a flesh-colored leotard. Watch the video; it will give you joy.

References of post-punk today aspire to fill a gaping hole left by the conformity of pop music with the spirit of erstwhile anarchy. “Concepts,” the first full-length album by Toronto-based new wave post-punk band Little Girls, aims to recreate this early-’80s recalcitrant feeling but falls short of succeeding. Pairing distinct, minor guitar riffs with scratchy and ethereal vocals, the duo—fronted by multi-instrumentalist Joel McIntyre of Pirate/Rock—brings to mind British post-punk staple Joy Division and ’80s one-hit-wonder Modern English, with a hint of Sigur Rós mysticism. The project, while coming somewhat near a rousing post-generation-Y anarchist spirit, ultimately fails at both creating a niche for itself and inspiring the alternative attitude so intended by the 11-track record.
Without comprehensible lyrics, the entire album relies heavily on its musical originality to justify its artistic endeavor, taking a risk with highly artificial melodies and voice tracks. “Youth Tunes” initiates the record with a synthesizer and a staccato guitar rhythm, while an odd, indiscernible voice warbles in the background and the guitar strums become progressively more ravaging. “Imaginary Friends” insists on an innocent nostalgia with its lilting yet pressing “oh’s,” attempting to pass off its gibberish as distinguishable lyrics. But the auditory pretend game is too rushed for comprehension, obscuring its sentimental moans with mismatched beats and forlorn growls. In “Venom,” drumbeats come in faltering steps and force unintended halts in the rhythm, ultimately transitioning the song into a fragmented and apparently unfinished conversation when it ends abruptly. The title track offers a moment of clarity with straightforward drumming and guitar riffs, but these are forced to wind through the formulaic, distorted vocals, with solos strewn in between for variety’s sake. In the end, the repetitiveness wins out as cycles of the same chorus never seem to make it to a specific destination, rotating around and around in guitar garble.
Admittedly, most songs on the album last less than three minutes, making for quick, on-the-go, post-millennium punk. The creative song names also make up for the lack of uttered lyrics, with titles such as “Salt Swimmers” and “Thrills” implying an inherently poetic, rebellious symbolism. But instead of feeling a powerful sensation of anti-establishment, we’re left with a mix of strange emotions. The album builds up tension with its onerous layers of dissonance and noise, but ultimately provides no gratification. Catharis-seekers will find it tough to restrain the urge to bash the nearest guitar into the ground out of frustration.
The album closes with “Growing,” making use of a not-so-subtle, save-the-best-for-last strategy. With a scratchy yet catchy melody complemented by a chipper pulse and moody vocalization, the ultimate track conceptualizes the youthful loss of the post-punk generation better than the 10 other songs prior to it. But even this finale can’t make up for the fuzzy blend of unclear intentions in the rest of the album, as McIntyre’s electronically-produced mumbles fade away into an abyss of lo-fi pop, void of any cohesion.
Recreating the new generation’s omnipresent fascination with punk may have seemed like an interesting way to refashion the old, but “Concepts” falls short with neither a sense of indie direction nor punk authority. The naïveté of Little Girls shows on its debut album, but credit should be granted to McIntyre and company for attempting to combine old post-punk with new alternative, even if precociously so.

Writer David Hajdu’s chronicle of the folk generation, “Positively Fourth Street” tells the story of a time back in the early ’60s—before the electric controversy, the motorcycle accident, and all the other events that would eventually turn him into legend—when a young Bob Dylan hung out at London’s Troubadour Club, heckling an Israeli woman’s performance. “Now there’s something you don’t see every day—a Jewish folk singer,” he joked with his Gentile buddies just before crashing the musician’s set (casually concealing the fact that he himself was just such an oddity). With this potent blend of self-deprecation and arrogance, Dylan has managed to keep us laughing at his jokes without quite grasping the crux of the punchline for decades, making his latest musical endeavor, an album of holiday standards entitled “Christmas in the Heart,” just as puzzling as it is entertaining. Nostalgic descriptions, like on “Silver Bells,” of how Christmas “shoppers rush home with their treasures” may seem a bit incongruous coming from the same singer who penned a batch of angry lyrics railing against the system. Luckily, Dylan hasn’t suddenly decided to sell out for some quick Christmas cash—sales from the album will go towards feeding families in need, both stateside and abroad.
Often lifting stray lyrics and imagery from obscure folk songs, the bulk of Dylan’s work thus far has played out like a cryptic cut-and-paste ode to Americana, complete with rowdy railroad men, brassy broads, dirt roads, and plenty of cigarette smoke. Atypically relinquishing song-writing duties on “Christmas in the Heart,” Dylan refrains from dramatically reworking the classics, instead blending his unique brand of gravelly gravitas with the schmaltzy sound of sleigh bells to surprisingly pleasant effect. Hilariously backed by a perfectly earnest bunch of session singers, Dylan’s rough-hewn voice crackles over their happy harmonizing like an old uncle with a bit too much bourbon in him.  Whether he’s gleefully awaiting Saint Nick’s arrival in “Here Comes Santa Claus” or politely growling an invitation to join him in a “Winter Wonderland,” Dylan’s amusement is audible.
Dylan’s past attempts at getting his sense of humor down on vinyl have provoked the ire of many a critic—most notably 1970’s confusingly quirky “Self-Portrait.” But if “Christmas in the Heart” hinges on a joke, this one is much more inclusive. When Dylan belts out a raspy proclamation of Christ’s birth, it’s simultaneously entertaining and endearing, and his heartfelt delivery is practically contagious. Dylan hasn’t exactly mastered Burl Ives, but to be fair, even his Woody Guthrie impression was always a creative interpretation at best.
Though Dylan tends to stay faithful to the original versions of the album’s 15 holiday tunes, “Must Be Santa,” the standout track, receives the full Dylan treatment. Whipping the song up into a foot-stomping, speedy accordion romp, the reindeer roll call gets cheekily politicized, with “Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon” and “Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton” joining the ranks of Santa’s better-known little helpers, Dasher, Prancer, and Vixen. Heading down under on “Christmas Island,” he pays tribute to both Jimmy Buffett and the Andrews’ Sisters renditions of the twangy ditty, with female singers cooing their answer to Dylan’s request to “stay up late like the islanders do.”
At one point on “Christmas in the Heart,” Dylan takes on “Do You Hear What I Hear?” posing the question repeatedly as he recounts the story of the nativity in song. Aside from the religious significance of the query, the song also serves as an apt metaphor for the album itself. In the past, Bob Dylan has often taken issue with critics’ and fans’ attempts to weed out the hidden meanings within his extensive catalog of songs, attempting to hear what isn’t there. “Christmas in the Heart,” with few original lyrical or arrangement contributions to Dylan’s credit, is an ideal album to take at face value. With chuckle-inducing songs, jovial back-up singers, and heartwarming sound effects, Dylan’s ruggedly whimsical compilation achieves just the right amount of warmth and fuzziness that a Christmas album should—nothing more and nothing less.

In a much-loved 1961 cover, Etta James famously sang, “I want a Sunday kind of love / A love to last past Saturday night.” Working its way through into one of the many warm, mesmeric scenes of Lone Scherfig’s new movie, “An Education,” the song becomes emblematic of the film itself. The melancholic strings and James’s wistful vocals are echoed in, and intertwined with, the sixties chic and rainy day intimacy of Nick Hornby’s latest screenplay.
Based on the memoirs of Lynn Barber, a renowned British journalist and less-renowned author of the seminal “How to Improve Your Man In Bed” manual, “An Education” focuses on the late adolescence of Jenny (Carey Mulligan), a London schoolgirl who enters a reckless romance with an older man. Hornby imbues the film’s script with his trademark wit and fast-paced plot development, but despite his compact and compelling writing—recognizable from earlier films like “High Fidelity”—he reveals a weakness for tidy resolution that foregoes the film’s darker, more powerful aspects.
Within the first 10 minutes of the film, 16-year-old Jenny meets 30-something David (Peter Sarsgaard). In the vein of Hugh Grant—another middle-aged Hornby bloke—David is armed with a charming smile, a fast car, and an affable worldliness. These qualities provide Jenny with an appealing escape from her oppressive world of resumé building and underwhelming pubescent suitors—a world entirely governed by her overbearing father, Jack (Alfred Molina).
The dull grays and whites of Jenny’s school and home life soon explode into the exuberant reds, golds, and blues of David’s seemingly fairy-tale existence. The stylish cinematography carries the film, subtly accommodating Hornby’s riotous sight gags while capturing the sophistication of the leads’ cosmopolitan adventures. Lush, gorgeous shots refresh the film’s rather familiar coming-of-age storyline and make the film’s central tension feel new and urgent.
In one beautifully constructed scene, David picks Jenny up from her house, playing his cool confidence off Jack’s bumbling attempts to control a daughter whose intelligence surpasses his own. Jenny joins David and his two elegantly detached peers—Danny (Dominic Cooper) and his glamorous girlfriend, Helen (Rosamund Pike)—for “supper” at one of London’s most posh restaurants. Here, the aforementioned “I Want a Sunday Kind of Love” rushes through the speakers, enveloping Jenny’s breathless contentment. The first three-quarters of the film are comprised of many scenes like this, delivering genuine humor, stunning cinematography, and well-constructed narrative at the same time they expose the sad nostalgia of growing up.
Helen, whose vapidity and self-satisfaction embody the concept of ignorant bliss, serves as one of two models for Jenny as she contemplates her future life. The other is her bookish teacher, Ms. Stubbs, played by Olivia Williams (who essentially reprises her role as Rosemary Cross in another coming-of-age classic, “Rushmore”).
When Helen encourages Jenny to update her wardrobe, pointing out that David would gladly buy her anything she wanted, Jenny is confused: “Why would David want to take me shopping?” This kind of natural, charming innocence keeps the audience sympathetic toward Jenny despite her vain, often painful attempts to seem old and sophisticated, the most embarrassing of which are her frequent, unprovoked outbursts of French.
Carey Mulligan—whose most notable screen credit to date is as one of the minor sisters in “Pride and Prejudice”—shines in her breakout role as Jenny, portraying a wealth of emotion, conflicting desires, and youthful rebellion with the subtlety and intelligence of a much more experienced actress. David’s emotions dictate the tonal shifts of the film, and Sarsgaard lives up to this responsibility with his confident but gradual revelation of his character’s true nature—equal parts sparkling charm, menacing deception, and inner conflict.
In the end, “An Education” asks all the right questions but yields too few answers to satiate the promises of its brilliant first three-quarters. When Jenny and David go to Paris together, the film temporarily drops all its weight and scrawls a breathless love letter to the city and the good looks of the protagonists. The conclusion—which should either re-pose the film’s questions or provide some answers—conveniently forgets them, summarizing the next four years of Jenny’s life in a clichéd voice-over that almost kills the movie. Still, while it lasts, the film is breathtaking, an achingly beautiful tribute to a half-imagined time when even the most devious among us knew how to cut a rug and fall in love.

In one of the many interrogation scenes of “Law Abiding Citizen,” Jamie Foxx peers into Gerard Butler’s jail cell and asks him how his family would feel about the crimes he has committed. “My wife and daughter can’t feel anything,” Butler replies without missing a beat. “They’re dead.” Believe it or not, this is the film at its most profound. “Law Abiding Citizen” aspires to be a smart thriller akin to director F. Gary Gray’s last hit, “The Italian Job,” but it ends up an unintentional comedy through its ludicrous premise and prolific overacting.
The story chronicles a battle of wits between Clyde Shelton (Butler) and Philadelphia lawyer Nick Rice (Foxx). A decade prior to the film’s setting, two thugs murdered Clyde’s wife and young daughter during a home invasion. In the ensuing trial, Nick cut a deal with one of the murderers in order to secure testimony against the other. Clyde was understandably opposed to Nick’s plan, so he spent the next 10 years plotting his revenge on not just the two men who murdered his family, but also on members of the justice system who failed to prosecute them to the fullest extent. At present, Clyde has just been arrested, but his targets manage to keep dying while he is locked safely away in solitary confinement, much to Nick’s frustration.
Intriguing mystery lies at the foundation of the film’s story, but the way it actually plays out is unimaginative and amateurish. Midway through the film, it is revealed that Clyde used to work for the government, devising killing methods that worked automatically, with no need for human interaction. This explains how he knows what particular species of pufferfish carries the poison he needs or the intricacies of rigging a cellphone to explode as soon as it is answered. What a remarkably convenient explanation for his inexplicable homicidal ability! The later revelation of who is actually helping Clyde commit his crimes is so inanely simple that it is almost insulting to the intelligence of the viewer.
“Law Abiding Citizen” wants to be two totally distinct movies. On the one hand, it aspires to take a play from the “Saw” franchise and showcase various gruesome and elaborate killing mechanisms. On the other, it wants to be an incisive analysis of the faults of our country’s current legal system. Gray inserts a few not-so-subtle shots of a William Penn statue to imply a moral connection between the just colonist and Clyde. (The only real connection seems to be that they were both in jail at some point.)
One of the film’s most egregious problems is that it puts no emphasis whatsoever on establishing any semblance of Clyde’s backstory, nor can it decide which of the two main characters it wants to agree with. As hard as it tries to legitimize Clyde’s motivation by constantly referencing his family, their brief appearance on screen does not do enough to explain any of his actions. Other details of the movie are similarly disconnected. Why doesn’t anyone notice the military-grade rocket launcher Clyde has erected in the middle of a cemetery? Why does he strip naked right before the police break into his house to arrest him? The world may never know.
Both Foxx and Butler must grapple with some of the corniest writing in recent memory. Foxx spends most of the movie trying to seem authoritative and “sassy,” habitually dropping F-bombs just to make his intentions clear, and in one shot, coolly walking away from an explosion as if he deals with them on a daily basis in his law practice. Meanwhile, Butler makes a sad attempt at portraying a psychotic yet profound killer. When a cellmate asks him how he ended up in prison, Butler cryptically responds, “I did what I had to do.” Well, that clears everything up.
Parts of “Law Abiding Citizen” are enjoyable, but for entirely different reasons than were intended. There are some inventive methods of killing people and a couple of big explosions in an attempt to sustain excitement, but these fail to distract from the movie’s fatal flaws. Toward the film’s end, Clyde looks up at Nick with a smirk on his face and says, “It’s gonna be biblical.” Indeed, “Law Abiding Citizen” fails in a way that can only be called epic.

It would be a tremendous shame if “The Damned United,” the latest collaboration between screenwriter Peter Morgan and actor Michael Sheen, were deemed merely a good sports movie. This is not a genre film. Football—soccer in this country—is not the subject matter so much as a conduit to the film’s study of ego and relationships. Previous collaborators on “Frost/Nixon” (in which Sheen played television presenter David Frost) and “The Special Relationship,” “The Deal,” and “The Queen” (all of which featured the Welsh actor as Tony Blair), Morgan and Sheen now embark on a very different kind of period piece.
“The Damned United” is the story of six years in the life of the late Brian Clough (Sheen), a soccer manager legendary for his success on the pitch as well as his penchant for the irreverent sound bite and a tendency, like Charles de Gaulle and Michael Jordan, to see his team as an extension of himself. Loosely based on the novel of the same name by David Peace, the film focuses on Clough’s ill-fated 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United—“The Damned United” of the title and the most successful English soccer team of the time. Interspersed are flashbacks to his years coaching Derby County, where he built his reputation as the best young manager in the English game.
As someone who has made his name in political films—in particular playing Tony Blair, a man to whom he bears a distinct physical resemblance—Sheen is a somewhat unlikely choice to play Clough, a working-class Geordie (from Middlesbrough in the North of England) who played as a center-forward before injuries led him to management. Rather than attempt to mimic the mannerisms of the real Brian Clough, Sheen instead engenders his own impressionist rendering of the manager’s persona. In some respects, however, Morgan and Sheen stick closely to the original—after all, Brian Clough was one of the most quotable figures in sports. Several of the film’s best lines—“I wouldn’t say I’m the best manager in the country, but I’m in the top one”—are not Morgan’s but Clough’s own.
Sheen’s Clough is not only arrogant but also insecure, desperate for public adulation, and obsessed with outdoing Don Revie (Colm Meaney), his predecessor as manager of Leeds United. Clough’s vendetta against Revie, a well-known historical fact, is nonetheless provided a fictional justification in the film. Soon after Clough has taken over as manager at then-lowly Second Division team Derby County, the First Division champions Leeds United come to Derby for an FA Cup game. In some of the film’s most affecting scenes, Clough and his staff spend weeks trying to get their pitiful pitch and stadium in a state fit for the visiting superstars, most notably Revie, Clough’s managerial icon. Yet when the day of the big game arrives, Don Revie blithely ignores Clough, refusing even to shake his hand. While purely a creation of Morgan’s script, the anecdote effectively grounds Clough’s real-life resentment of Revie.
The ensuing preoccupation with Revie explains many of Clough’s actions throughout the rest of the film. Like Paul Ashworth in “Fever Pitch” (1997; not the Jimmy Fallon movie about the Red Sox), Clough is consumed by soccer to the detriment of his mental and physical health and the well-being of those around him. But the true emotional and thematic centerpiece of “The Damned United” is the relationship between Clough and his assistant manager, Peter Taylor (brilliantly played by Timothy Spall, best known for his role as Peter Pettigrew in the “Harry Potter” movies). Taylor is the antithesis to Clough—quiet, low-key, and behind the scenes while Clough is an inveterate and foul-mouthed attention-seeker. Yet the two men are devoted to, and utterly dependent on, each other. Clough’s expanding ego leads to a rift with Taylor, and Clough moves to Leeds United on his own. Much of his failure there is explained by his loneliness in Taylor’s absence, and when he is sacked 44 days later, in the film’s most poignant moment, he drives down to Brighton to reconcile with his partner.
“The Damned United,” by the mere nature of its theme, is unlikely to attract American audiences. Despite the growing interest in soccer in this country, a film about Leeds United in the 1970s, featuring faded stars whose names are now familiar only to Leeds fans, is a minor enthusiasm. After their explorations of epochal moments in British and American history in “The Queen” and “Frost/Nixon,” this is a decidedly quiet triumph from Peter Morgan and Michael Sheen. Yet it underscores their masterful ability to bring characters and events from our recent history to complex, sympathetic, and gripping life–a skill unmatched in contemporary cinema.

Ten plain lines and eighteen colorful illustrations—this is all that comprises Maurice Sendak’s beloved 1963 children’s book, “Where the Wild Things Are.” And yet, through the eyes of director Spike Jonze, Sendak’s anarchic world undergoes a creative transformation that reaches far beyond the modest offerings of the book. Jonze takes Sendak’s world of childhood rebellion and roguish imagination and spins it into an extended discourse on growing up and the importance of family.
The film begins with the same mischief that introduces the protagonist, Max, in the book. After a heated argument with his mother (Catherine Keener)—who goes unseen in the book—Max dons a tattered wolf costume, runs to the woods behind his house, and escapes by sea to an imaginary island. Residing there are nine enormous monsters known as the Wild Things. Though seemingly barbaric at first—upon Max’s arrival, they are destroying their homes by bonfire—these Wild Things are charmingly naïve and quickly proclaim Max their new king. The Wild Things entrust Max with the task of “keeping out the sadness,” a responsibility he confidently takes on for fear of being eaten. With this, he begins to mold his chaotic new kingdom into an idealistic one where, in his words, “only the things you want to happen, would happen”—albeit fleetingly.
Jonze, together with Dave Eggers—who dipped into screenwriting earlier this year with Sam Mendes’ “Away We Go”—crafted nine compassionate, insecure, and endearingly humorous beasts from the mute monsters of Sendak’s book. A compelling combination of animatronics and CGI, these gargantuan monsters come to life with the exceptional voice work of Oscar-winning greats like Forest Whitaker and Chris Cooper.
The young Max Records, who was all of 9 when shooting for the film began, deserves special praise for his expressive portrayal of Max, convincingly presenting him as both obnoxious brat and benevolent dictator. Max emerges as a much more nuanced and developed character in the film than his literary counterpart. He is less impish and more thoughtful, and he experiences a more profound realization at the movie’s end. The creation and destruction of the home is a recurring motif. Max is seen building forts, igloos, and king’s quarters, but none of these endure or give him the safety he seeks. Likewise, the Wild Things are drawn to caves and attempt to construct their own safe refuge in the form of a large, wooden cocoon.
The movie’s two primary beasts are the temperamental Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) and the pragmatic, restless KW (voiced by Lauren Ambrose), who, much like Max, flees her home seeking something more. Through the Wild Things’ search for a womb-like shelter free from loneliness, Max comes to understand his own need for the security provided by family.
Jonze imitates Sendak’s cramped illustrations of Max’s life at home with up-close, claustrophobic frames in the first part of the film. As the book continues, Sendak’s illustrations grow larger, eventually encompassing two pages; in the film, these expansive depictions of Max’s imagined realm become vast frames of striking deserts and forests that swallow viewers whole.
With so little written material from which to create a feature-length film, Jonze and Eggers’ plot understandably lacks direction at times. In one bizarre subplot, KW takes Max on a short journey to meet two of her friends. These turn out to be a pair of rowdy owls whose screeching cannot be understood by Max or the monsters. Scenes with these two characters seem largely out of place and even confusing when considering the larger narrative.
There are a few overlong scenes of island chaos, which don’t advance the plot, but these only add to the sense of harmless anarchy that Sendak evokes, and thus remain true to the book. These more trivial scenes are ultimately eclipsed by exceptionally poignant exchanges, in particular Max’s one-on-one conversations with Carol and KW. The audience realizes through these more personal scenes that very little separates these giant monsters from their young ruler.
“Where the Wild Things Are” is the first in a series of prominent children’s book adaptations that will hit theatres in the coming months, including Wes Anderson’s take on Roald Dahl’s “Fantastic Mr. Fox” and Tim Burton’s live-action remake of Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Thankfully, Jonze steers clear of the common, sanitized book-to-film route that so many directors have followed in the past. “Where the Wild Things Are” preserves the original’s crucial sense of magic and mischief, but its mature treatment of fear and loss is what makes it a truly memorable adaptation.

Watched more closely than any other  in a generation, life for the First Family cannot be without its challenges, chief amongst which must be projecting a sense of openness while maintaining their own privacy. One can only imagine the forethought that led up to last week’s announcement from the First Lady’s Office regarding the artworks that Mr. and Mrs. Obama will be borrowing from Washington museums to decorate their private home, as well as the parts of the White House’s East and West wings. However, rules dictated by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House serve to limit a building-wide aesthetic overhaul. Works considered for inclusion in the permanent collection, which constitutes most art displayed in public spaces, must have been made over 25 years ago, and their creating artist must be deceased. This accounts for the collection’s overwhelming focus on 18th- and 19th-century paintings, as well as the lack of ethnic and gender diversity in the collection.
Given the Obamas’ well-known fondness of contemporary art (their first date included a trip to the Art Institute of Chicago), the traditional leaning of so much of the White House’s art is a likely motivation for the First Lady’s decision to incorporate works by more contemporary artists in the building’s non-public spaces. Mrs. Obama has been quoted numerous times stating that she believes the White House is ultimately, “America’s house.”  The roughly 45 pieces requested, comprised mainly of portraits of Native Americans in the Old West, 20th-century abstract paintings, and sculptures, were undoubtedly curated to reflect both the Obamas’ personal tastes as well as the new administration’s approach and aspirations.
Over the past week, much of the talk about these new additions to the White House has surrounded the Ed Ruscha piece entitled “I think I’ll…” in which elliptical statements including “Wait a Minute… I… I…” and “Maybe… No…” are set against a blood orange background. The piece, a meditation on the decision-making process, has unsurprisingly been read as a political signifier. For some, it embodies the President’s thoughtful approach to governing; for others, it ironically captures his characteristic indecision and lack of achievement in office. As Ed Pilkington noted in The Guardian, the Ruscha piece “pretty much sums up the 44th presidency as seen through the eyes of Fox News.”
The inclusion of two twin works by abstract painter Alma Thomas, however, speaks volumes more to the President and First Lady’s political and artistic leanings. The first of these two works, entitled “Watusi (Hard Edge),” is a painting directly inspired by Henri Matisse’s paper collage “L’escargot,” the second, a fabric-like abstract work in blue called, “Sky Light.”
While far less prominent than the Ruscha debate, the inclusion of the former of these two pieces has received its own share of criticism. Ben Shapiro of Big Hollywood penned a piece entitled, “The Obama White House’s Plagiaristic, Silly Art.” Perhaps most biliously, Michelle Malkin—yes, the same woman who bizarrely accused Dunkin Donuts and Rachel Ray of advocating Islamic extremism—commented on her website, “Can anyone say plagiarism? American art? I don’t think so!” Not only is this characterization wildly misguided—as a brief inquiry into Thomas’ biography reveals—it distracts from developing a more appropriate reading of the painting’s intended significance, as well as the Obama’s motivations for chosing it.
Born in Georgia and raised in Washington D.C., Thomas was the first graduate of Howard University’s then-nascent art department, as well as the first black woman to receive either an MFA from Columbia University or a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum in New York. A lifelong schoolteacher, Thomas’ commitment to art education is perhaps explained by her own denial from many public museums as a young girl. While much of her early work was marked by a distinct realist style, as she aged, her work became increasingly abstract. With this in mind, “Watusi”—whose name stems from the 60s era song-and-dance craze, as well as the Batutsi tribe of Rwanda—can thus be read to be as much a product of Thomas’ lament at having been denied opportunities in the arts as it is a veiled protest of art historians’ negligence in noting the extent to which African art influenced Matisse.
Thomas’ decision to rotate the piece 90 degrees, as well as her near-complete color reversal (greens are pinks, and most symbolically, bright oranges become blues), speaks to multiple beliefs: the color reversal, to the historic mistreatment of black people in Western societies; the correspondence in shape, to a fundamental common ground between all peoples’ experiences. In short, Matisse may have gotten some credit where credit was perhaps not due, but this fact did not impede Thomas from either being inspired by or relating to his work. This notion is further illustrated by her second painting included in the collection, “Sky Light,” which distills her earlier (and arguably more derivative) use of large blocks into the small-brushstroked celebrations of color for which she became known. With this pairing, “Watusi” emerges as a work by an artist conscious of the history and struggle of her race but devoid of vindictiveness, confident in the potential of all people to find common ground.
In her book “Alma W. Thomas: A Retrospective of the Paintings”, she notes, “Through color I have sought to concentrate on beauty and happiness, rather than on man’s inhumanity to man.” Many argue that it was just this relatable and hopeful approach to the politics beneath her work that allowed her to break so many barriers in the art world. Sound like anyone you know?

Although the story of “The Flies,” opening tonight on the Loeb Mainstage, originated 2,500 years ago, its ancient philosophy remains central to the contemporary reimagining of the story. “We’re taking this play that I think is absolutely brilliant, but I’ve never actually seen performed, and trying to present it in a way that a young, modern-day audience is supposed to relate to and get excited about,” says director Geordie F. Broadwater ’04. In an effort to do this, Broadwater replaced temples and sandals with dive bars and spurs.
“The Flies” is a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of Orestes, a prince who returns to his native city of Argos only to find that the gods have been punishing the city for failing to stop his mother, Queen Clytemnestra, from murdering her first husband. The play centers on Orestes’ attempt to challenge the gods, and his decision about whether it is easier to live a predetermined life of penitence or to accept the responsibility of choosing one’s own destiny. Jean-Paul Sartre adapted the myth into a play in 1943 to create an allegory about life in France under the Nazi occupation. Broadwater rewrote the dialogue to reflect the way that modern college students speak and chose to rethink the play as a western in the style of “No Country for Old Men.”
“I was thinking about myths,” explains Broadwater. “This is a Greek play, so I tried to wrap my head around what American myths are. The story basically has the plot of a western and a samurai movie, and I decided to go with the western.” This decision involved numerous changes to the original script, including a complete overhaul of the setting. The throne room of the original becomes a tycoon’s office; the temple of Apollo becomes a hacienda-style church; and the cave of the spirits becomes an old mine. Most of the action, however, takes place in a bar.
“In a seedy little town,” observes set designer M. Amelia Muller ’11, “the bar is always the centerpiece, and it’s always a scummy bar.” Muller was able to accomplish this run-down aesthetic using the same brown colors that dominate the play’s posters. But the biggest challenge of “The Flies” for Muller was the scale of the production, which demanded five distinct sets.
Despite the ancient origin of the story, the actors insist that its message is highly relevant for college students. “I think it’s a really nuanced investigation of freedom and the responsibility that freedom brings, and the decision to accept responsibility and come into full consciousness,” says Madeleine A. Bennett ’11, who plays one of the Furies. “It’s not just an affirmation of freedom, but a critical look at what it implies and whether it’s worth taking on.”
The play also includes controversial elements, especially a climactic moment when the spirits of the dead are released from the old mine to haunt the city for a day. “The religious ceremony will be taken by a lot of people as absurd,” says Chris J. Carothers ’11. “It’s very vicious towards religion in general. It’s modeled on real ceremonies that actually exist. It’s not fake, it’s not absurd, it’s not even exaggerated.” Carothers adds that the ceremony reminded him of Shiite self-flagellation ceremonies that were used to mourn Imam Hussein and that the scene is supposed to recreate the feelings of shock and discomfort that come when one is immersed in a new place or culture. However, Broadwater says that the scene is not meant as a direct criticism of religion. “I think that the play deals a lot with thinking for yourself, and I think that sometimes, some people can lean on the crutch of religion in lieu of thinking for themselves. I don’t think that religion is bad, but I think that blindly following dogma is something that Sartre would have taken issue with.”
“The Flies” is this year’s incarnation of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s Visiting Director’s Project, which involves bringing a professional director to Cambridge to direct a production on the Loeb Mainstage. The resulting piece is usually considered HRDC’s main play of the season. Many members of the cast say that working with Broadwater has been a positive experience for them as actors. “When you’re working with peers [as directors],” says Carolyn W. Holding ’10, who plays Electra, “it’s tough because you’re friends, but they are also an authority figure. With other professionals that we’ve had, they’re very established and set in their ways. Geordie... still understands our state of mind.” Because Broadwater wrote this adaptation of “The Flies” himself, the cast was free to make changes during rehearsals, and both the actors and Broadwater stress that the piece has been a collaborative effort.
“My training and experience since graduating has led me to embrace the idea that actors are artists capable of great thought, and that should be utilized in rehearsal,” says Broadwater. “I wanted to make a script that was fresh, interesting and funny. I was interested in fleshing out the emotions of the principal characters. I think they’re a little two-dimensional on the page, so I spent a lot of time talking with the actors and asking questions.”
Tali B. Friedman ’10, who plays Clytemnestra, appreciates this approach to acting and learning a character. “When I started, I was looking at her as a villain, but over the last couple weeks I’ve come to sympathize with her. She made a bad choice and it all came crashing around her head,” she says.
“I didn’t want Clytemnestra to be the evil woman,” Broadwater adds. “The more we find ways to understand who she is and feel her pain, the more we empathize with her, so that she seems like a real human being.”
Besides the elaborate technical aspects of the production and the presence of a professional director, the subject matter of “The Flies” should appeal to a broad variety of students. “What’s really cool is that it can cross literary and genre boundaries,” says Muller. “It is first Greek myth, then Sartre, and then Geordie’s interpretation of Sartre. It offers something to many different people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One night in late April 1990, Robert C. Guillemin, at the request of Senator John F. Kerry, drove a 5,000-gallon golf course watering-truck down Storrow Drive; left in its wake were swaths of green paint and 19 scurrying art students to spread them across the road. The next day, droves of Bostonians, armed with sidewalk chalk, stepped out onto the highway and began filling the new “meadow” with drawings of birds, butterflies, and rabbits. Orchestrated by the then-brand new non-profit arts organization Art Street, Incorporated, this Earth Day celebration was founder Guillemin’s first large-scale endeavor to bring art back into the streets and to the people—a mission he continued most recently with the event “sideWalk Through Time” at the Harvard Museum of Natural History two weeks ago.
“It seems to me that it’s wasteful to have the arts be a fringe, renegade institution, unauthorized, skirting central issues and attacking them like an Indian war party,” Guillemin says. “Arts have to find out important causes, go directly to the people who are in charge of them, claim that the arts can provide a better way of handling these problems than any way that’s instituted so far, and then work diligently with bureaucracies so that the good of society is bettered.”
This enthusiasm for publicly accessible art has been the driving force behind Art Street, Inc., an initiative which has channeled Guillemin’s life-long interests in morality and the democratization of art. Though he once believed he would become a Jesuit priest, Guillemin’s desire to become an artist turned itself into a full-fledged career; after studying art in college, he became a copyist at the Louvre and returned to Boston to found his own gallery. However, he eventually grew concerned with his artistically abstract lifestyle.
“The better and better my art was getting, I was speaking to fewer and fewer people in a coded language that the art world understood, but that people outside the art world did not understand at all,” he says. It was this disconnect from society that drove him to recreate the “Mona Lisa” on the sidewalks of Boston’s Washington Street.
“It was kind of a daring statement to take what was in museums out of museums,” he says. “It was a daring statement to address a new kind of audience that didn’t enjoy the reverential quietude and sublime aura of museums, and get out into daily life, where everything is treated with kind of a common ordinariness.” To bring this message to more audiences, Guillemin began Art Street, Inc., which works to improve communities through art projects inspired by humanitarian efforts.
“I thought art should be pressed into the service of every man, of every human being, and should become a voice for every human being,” Guillemin says, “and should seek out situations in which people were being ignored, where people had no voice. Art, which is a very able voice, could become the voice of the needy.” As reinforcement for his beliefs, Guillemin rebaptized himself and now goes by the name of Sidewalk Sam (or, as he is better known, Sidewalk).
To differentiate itself from other street art collectives, such as graffiti artists, Art Street moves far from being a fringe art organization, integrating itself into the community to perform its work.
“I think this is real trust from the community in what Sidewalk’s doing,” says artist Russell T. Freeland, Art Street’s Manager of Program Operations. “He sort of imposed himself at first—doing what he was doing, getting hassled by the police—and the community folks got together and decided on how they could give him a de facto license to do this in the city. I really don’t know who else has that kind of license in a major city in the United States.”
Every year, Art Street collaborates with Mayor Menino and various Boston-based companies to create the Boston ArtWalk. With a team of artists, Guillemin decorates the city’s sidewalks with paint replicas of famous works and artistic posters to benefit social welfare organizations; each piece of art is sponsored by a particular company that has its logo associated with it. But Guillemin does not see these partnerships with corporations as a compromise to Art Street’s democratic ideals; rather, he believes that it allows the organization to ally with institutions powerful enough to make a visible difference. “The idea is good,” Guillemin says. “To have corporations promote general well-being is a principle that works.”
Paint for Peace, another effort between Art Street and the City of Boston, promotes peace in neighborhoods affected by gun violence among children and teenagers. Mayor Menino first outlined the problem to Guillemin three years ago; Guillemin then rallied artists and sent them into Boston’s most dangerous neighborhoods. The artists worked with children in after-school programs to create banners and flags that publicly displayed statements about the good parts of their neighborhoods. They also painted doves of peace on sidewalks where killings had occurred. The effort reached its peak two years ago when 1,200 schoolchildren gathered to paint a 5,000 square foot dove of peace in City Hall Plaza.
Art Street’s positive message and Guillemin’s idealistic fervor are a buoyant force for inspiring people and attracting collaborators to its cause.
“The way that [Sidewalk’s] outlook on people and on life is so focused on the positive and is so celebratory has definitely influenced me,” says Benjamin Kotrc, a fourth-year GSAS student in Earth and Planetary Sciences whose initial idea for a project to join art and science eventually evolved into “sideWalk Through Time,” a community-wide endeavor to create an expansive sidewalk mural of the history of the Earth.
“Sidewalk was stopping people—who he often didn’t realize were as important as they are—as they were walking through,” says Jennifer Peterson, the event’s organizer and an educator at the Museum of Natural history. “He took them off-guard and said, ‘Draw something.’ He really got a bunch of people on the ground who thought they would never do that.”
This testament to the ability of art—and Guillemin—to connect people with ideas or other people with whom they would not otherwise interact is just one example of the potential in Art Street’s goals.
“I think like an artist and a moralist,” Guillemin says. “I think breathlessly about the ability of the arts to be a leader to bring society into a more moral and enlightened stage.”

The Nobel Peace Prize Committee’s announcement last Friday that Barack Obama would become the next recipient of its prestigious award caught the whole world—including the White House—by surprise. And the committee’s assertion that Obama deserved the Nobel Prize “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” has done little to mollify critics, who note that there is little in the way of substantial, sustained progress toward peace on Obama’s resume. Indeed, the elevation of speeches and promises over concrete achievements involved in Obama’s selection suggests that the committee did not award the Nobel to the individual who “shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”
Undoubtedly, Obama has made efforts toward peace and set a refreshing tone after eight years of the Bush administration’s belligerent foreign policy. His many overtures toward peace with the Middle East such as his momentous speech in Cairo and his vision of a non-nuclear world as expressed in Prague are undeniable evidence that Obama is a president whose desires are certainly in line with those of the Nobel Committee.
But this is not tantamount to making real, sustained progress toward peace. Obama is coming up on his nine-month anniversary of becoming the 44th president of the United States, and though he has demonstrated bold vision, there has been too little time for his plans to come to fruition. The tenor of our relations with the Middle East may have changed, but our engagement in two wars there has not. Obama may have expressed sincere desires for a nuke-free world, but these weapons are still very much in existence.
In many ways, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee’s move seems to be little more than a rebuke of the previous administration. It would be naïve to say that the Nobel Peace Prize is not a political statement, but this year the political agenda appears particularly blatant. The award seems in this case to be a reaction that was 8 years coming, rather than a matter of desert.
But the Nobel Prize Committee’s misguided attempt to make a political statement should not reflect poorly upon President Obama or his presidency thus far. The Nobel Peace Prize was the last thing on Obama’s mind when he received the award. Additionally, the president responded with appropriate humility by noting that he did not feel he deserved the prize and has done the best thing he can reasonably be expected to do in such a situation by treating the award as a “call to action.” Hopefully, President Obama’s noble sentiments will translate into a real change in the course of international affairs and allow him to become someone who deserves to be called a great peacemaker.

“The question we have to ask is who has done the most in the previous year to enhance peace in the world. And who has done more than Barack Obama?” said the chairman of the Nobel Committee, after announcing that President Obama had won this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. It is this question, not one’s opinion on Obama’s domestic policies or what he might do in the future, that is the salient issue when evaluating whether Obama should have won the prize. And in this regard, Obama is clearly the most deserving candidate.
In the past year, Obama has changed the tenor of international diplomacy through his speeches and actions. The results have not been visibly shocking, but that does not mean his accomplishment should be dismissed. Major conflicts do not start when the first shot is fired; they start when the first harsh word is thrown and when antagonism builds at a local level between individuals. Obama’s repeatedly stated commitment to open-minded dialogue is preventing and mitigating grassroots antagonism around the world.
For example, in the president’s June 2009 speech from Cairo to the Islamic world, he quoted the Koran several times and even started with the Islamic greeting, “salaam aleikum.” The clash of Western and Islamic countries marks a major fracture in international peace. Thus, Obama’s stated desire to gain a better understanding of Islamic culture is a big step forward for everyone. Speaking in places such as Ghana and Germany, he has made a similar effort to change people’s entrenched assumptions about conflict in many regions.
When people say, “but they’re just words,” they seem to be forgetting that it is the president of the United States who is saying them—someone who can back up such words with executive control of a trillion-dollar economy and thousands of troops. It is a plain reality that, in nine months in office, President’s Obama’s actions have had more of an effect on the world than a lifetime of work by most activists. This does not make the efforts of advocates such as Burma’s Aung San Su Kyi or Bill and Melinda Gates any less praiseworthy, but it does put them in perspective. As “the leader of the free world,” the American president’s words do matter.
Ask anyone who has traveled abroad in the past year—Obama has brought a change in the international perception of the United States and a renewed confidence that long-standing conflicts can be resolved. Perhaps the Nobel Committee has recognized this and is indicating “political” support for this newly conciliatory U.S. position. But, even so, what’s actually so wrong with that? It would be a little hypocritical if the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize did not in itself promote peace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A stern looking Armenian minister shook the hand of his smiling Turkish counterpart as cameras flashed and onlookers cheered: Such is an apt summary of last Saturday’s signing ceremony of the Turkish-Armenian peace treaty at the University of Zurich. Its aim was no less than to end a century of enmity and open up the borders between the two countries. Despite all the spectacle, however, the treaty still has a long way to go; it still faces the difficult task of being ratified by both parliaments. And, realistically, the chances of it doing so are unlikely—and for good reason. While an admirable gesture, the treaty fails to seriously address the problems at the root of the Turkish-Armenian conflict.
Certainly, a peace between the two countries would be ideal. Both countries have been at it for decades. Armenia has been pressuring Turkey for years to acknowledge the Armenian genocide that occurred during the Ottoman rule during the First World War, while Turkey continues to maintain that the massacre doesn’t fall into the category of genocide. Relations between the two countries took another ugly turn when Armenia invaded territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan back in 1993. Turkey, Azerbaijan’s ally, has since closed its border with Armenia.
Yet as it stands, the treaty leaves these main issues unresolved. While the agreement ensures that diplomatic ties will be established and borders opened, no mention can be found of either genocide or Azerbaijan; any peace it achieves will thus be unsustainable.
Current events reveal just how pressing the ignored issues are. During his tour of Armenian communities that took him to Paris, Beirut, and Moscow, Armenian President Serkh Sarkisyan was met by angry protesters and crowds calling him a traitor. And Facebook groups abound in which Lebanese-Armenians call for the closing of the Armenian parliament in order to prevent the ratification of the treaty.
True, the treaty does propose the creation of a historical commission that will look into the events of WWI. Yet Armenians fear that the events will be watered down, and they have legitimate right to be suspicious. Even the U.S. and Turkey went through a rough patch last year because of the issue, and Turkish officials are still reluctant to call the massacre a genocide. The patching-over of such a gaping huma-rights issue with something as insubstantial as a “commission” promises no real redress for Turkish wrongs.
On the other side, Turkey is still waiting for Armenia to withdraw its troops from the Azerbaijan territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh. The dispute was not addressed by the treaty, despite the delay of the signing ceremony itself due to protests that such remarks were supposed to be part of the Turkish minister’s address; even hours before the signing of the treaty, these unresolved issues threatened to derail the peace process. And the Turkish prime minister still continues to threaten the closing of the country’s borders if Armenia doesn’t peacefully withdraw its forces, even though the treaty dictates the opening of the border within two months.
With such elephants still in the room, it would have been wise to delay signing the treaty until the problems have at least begun to be discussed. Until that time, any signing can only be premature, an empty gesture rather than a real political solution. In its current condition, the treaty resembles a band-aid trying to close a punctured artery: an admirable gesture, but a misguided one. And, if there’s any time to really address these issues, it’s now—left unresolved, they threaten to create deeper faults that might require another century to bridge.

Today is Oscar Wilde’s birthday. He would be 155 years old, and he would not be enjoying it very much. “Youth is the only thing worth having,” he would mutter quietly into his cake. But he’d appreciate the attention.
And he would deserve it. (Nowadays, in the midst of bans on sexiling and Nobel Peace Prize furors, it’s easy to forget the truly important things, like calling your parents or stopping to wish happy birthday to the “first modern man.”) Wilde is an invaluable acquaintance. Often, in situations where I am required to appear witty, I simply steal large chunks from his works and attempt to pass them off as my own with minor modifications. I’m not the first to do this—Dorothy Parker noted, “If, with the literate, I am/Impelled to try an epigram/I never seek to take the credit/We all assume that Oscar said it.” But I know he would approve. When a woman told him that a passage from one of his plays reminded her of a drama she had read before, he nodded. “Taken bodily from it,” he admitted. “Why not? No one reads anymore.”
I first met Oscar at the age of 14. All four of my wisdom teeth had just been removed, and I lay prone on the couch bleeding into a bag of frozen peas. There was nothing else to do but read
The Picture of Dorian Gray.” After that, it was impossible to stop. I read everything he had ever written, from the poems to the prose to the plays, except for that one book attributed to him that you can only buy online. Wilde said of himself that he summed up all systems in a phrase and all existence in an epigram, and he was right. There was no subject he couldn’t speak on. Once someone asked him to comment on the queen. “The queen is not a subject!” he shot back. Like most of my favorite Wildean phrases, this joke is something I keep trying to spring on people in conversation. (“Ask me to talk about anything! Any subject at all!” I tell people. “Health care,” they respond. People nowadays lack imagination.) But that doesn’t stop me. Oscar gets dragged into every conceivable situation. “Do you like the consistency of this soup?” people ask me. “Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative,” I retort.
Now, seven years later, we’re still going strong. And we have so much in common—for instance, we both like men! And if someone wants to catapult me to fame, say, by basing a comic opera on me and sending me on a tour of North America in which I lecture about interior design, you can find me sitting in my room trying to live up to my china.
Wilde is an invaluable guide to life. And for people who find the concept of asking “What Would Jesus Do?” in certain, specific situations a little uncomfortable—does Jesus sleep with people after the third date? —“What Would Oscar Do?” can serve as a handy replacement. Of course, not all his advice is useful; as he pointed out, “The only thing to do with advice is to pass it on. It is never any use to oneself.” And some of it lacks practical applications, like that thing he said about plump missionaries being “God’s gift to starving cannibals.” But some of his remarks are startlingly perceptive. “Anyone can sympathize with the sufferings of a friend. But it requires a truly fine nature…to sympathize with a friend’s success.” Especially at Harvard, this line can be painfully apt. And his relationship advice can be remarkably consoling. “In life, there are only two tragedies,” Wilde noted. “One is not getting what one wants. The other is getting it.”
Sometimes, listening to him can get you into trouble. Oscar said he put his genius into his life and his talent into his works. I keep trying to explain this to professors. “Sure, my paper fails to capture the existential stillness of Conrad’s prose,” I say, “but I had a brilliant weekend! My wallet is in Rhode Island!”
But Oscar offers vital encouragement in all areas of life—for instance, in the realm of dress. Someone said that fashion makes a statement. Often, the statement my outfits make is, “It is a distinct possibility that the person who assembled me is colorblind.” I lost a sweater once. My friends believe it was carelessness, but I think it was trying to escape. Once, in delight at hearing that knee socks had come back in, I rushed out and purchased a pair striped in rainbow colors. Every so often I wear them outdoors and people excitedly inquire when the rest of the pride parade will be coming along. But Oscar has a phrase for these naysayers.  “Fashion is what one wears oneself,” he noted. “What is unfashionable is what other people wear.”
Now, 155 years later, I like to think Oscar would feel at home in our world. I don’t know whether he would be consigned to the David Sedaris circuit of National Public Radio and well-attended lectures, take Broadway by storm, or become the next Lady Gaga and show up at the Video Music Awards dressed as an angry lampshade. But imagine what a Twitter following he would have.
Regardless, I wish him the best. “To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,” Wilde once noted. The same could be said of loving Oscar Wilde. Happy birthday, Oscar.

Bruce J. Wasserstein—a graduate of the Harvard Business and Law Schools who led financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard and gained fame as a pioneer of hostile takeovers in business—died Wednesday in New York City.
Administrators from both of his alma maters fondly remembered his connections to the University.
“In addition to being a legendary Wall Street figure, Bruce Wasserstein was also a dedicated and valued member of the Harvard Community and a wonderful example of the far reaching impact Harvard Business School alumni have made in the business world and beyond,” wrote Jay O. Light, dean of the Business School, in an e-mailed statement.
At the Law School, Wasserstein was a longtime member of the Dean’s Advisory Board and donated $25 million two years ago for the construction of a major academic and student center in the North Yard.
Wasserstein’s death comes just weeks after that of another HLS philanthropist—Finn M.W. Caspersen, who donated over $30 million to the Law School and chaired its $476 million capital campaign last year.
“All of us at Harvard Law School are stunned and saddened by the unexpected passing of Bruce Wasserstein, one of our most prominent and influential alumni,” wrote Steven Oliveira, associate dean for development and alumni relations at the Law School, in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson. “As one of the largest benefactors in HLS’ history, Mr. Wasserstein had a transformational impact on past, current, and future students.”
Although he began his career as a lawyer at the prestigious firm of Cravath, Swain & Moore, Wasserstein eventually went into banking. When he joined the investment bank First Boston, he helped build the firm into one of the most prominent mergers and acquisitions establishments of the 1980s, according to media reports.
By 1988, Wasserstein—in conjunction with his partner Joseph Perella of First Boston—created Wasserstein Perella & Co., a smaller investment bank that was eventually sold in 2000 for around $1.4 billion.
Since the sale, Wasserstein worked on several notable deals, including Carl Icahn’s now-famous attempted take-over of AOL Time Warner.
But Wasserstein also had an unusual side interest for a man with a financial career—journalism. In 2004, he purchased New York Magazine, which tracks the key players of Manhattan life each week.
Many have wondered whether Wasserstein’s death will cause the magazine to be sold, but most speculation seems to have focused on his replacement as owner.
A Wasserstein family trust owns New York Magazine, and media observers have posited that Wasserstein’s children may now decide to control the magazine rather than sell it.
Of the Wasserstein children, Pamela S. Wasserstein ’00, Ben C. Wasserstein ’03, and A. Scoop Wasserstein ’07 all contributed to The Crimson in their years at Harvard, and Ben C. Wasserstein ’03 edited Fifteen Minutes, The Crimson’s weekly magazine.
Wasserstein is survived by his current wife, Angela Chao, and his seven children, one of whom is the adopted child of his late sister, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein, who died of lymphoma in 2006.
According to a statement issued by Lazard, the cause of death has not yet been determined, although Wasserstein had been hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat a few days earlier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student panelists discussed the nuances and complications of dating outside one’s race last night in an event hosted by the Harvard Foundation.
While participants established a consensus early on that younger generations—themselves included—were more open to the idea of interracial dating, they soon began to explore problems that arise surrounding the issue, including why, in some circumstances, it can be easier for a specific gender to date outside their race.
“Hispanic men can date other ethnicities, but when a Hispanic woman dates outside, there is this reaction of ‘you belong to us,’” said panelist Stephanie Delgado ’10, referring to what she described as the perception that it is acceptable for Hispanic men to date women of other ethnicities, but because of the idea of ‘machisimo’—an exaggerated sense of masculinity and general male domination—Hispanic women who try to date outside their race are scorned.
Delgado said she decided to participate in the discussion to show that interracial dating isn’t binary—between just Caucasians and Blacks—but includes relationships like hers, between a Mexican-American and a Filipino.
In other ethnicities though, the idea of a woman dating outside her race is acceptable, she said.
“It may be more acceptable for Asian women to date white men,” Delgado said.
Yet for Daniel C. Suo ’10, an Asian-American, it is hard to approach any woman outside his race because he is aware that his Asian background may be an issue.
James A. Fish ’10, one of the panelists said while people may be accepting of a match, they may still question the motivation behind it.
Fish said he finds problematic that others will “put a justification for it that can turn to ‘maybe there’s a fetish going on there,’” instead of assuming the relationship is simply about love.
The discussion also touched on why there might be a stigma surrounding interracial dating.
“It’s because people are scared. People are just afraid the America they’re used to seeing will be gone,” said panelist Kimberly N. Foster ’11. She attributed this worry to concerns about cultural preservation.
Audience member Olivia M. Shopshear ’12 said that discussion was the best way to make progress on this issue.
“There is a line between overemphasis and discussion,” she cautioned. “Too much emphasis on dating someone of a different race will make it a major problem.”

Small concentrations of a toxic chemical were found in a Harvard graduate student housing complex, officials announced Wednesday, though they said that levels were not high enough to raise immediate health concerns.
Nevertheless, the Environmental Protection Agency is likely to request that Harvard contain or remove the Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) from Peabody Terrace, according to EPA spokesman David Deegan, who added that the EPA still must receive the data from Harvard to proceed in any fashion.
The PCB concentrations of 30 outdoor samples that were collected by Harvard range from undetectable levels to 3.29 mg/kg, according to University spokesman Joshua D. Poupore. Three of these samples exceeded the Mass. Department of Environmental Protection soil screening level of 2 mg/kg—a benchmark that, if exceeded, requires more testing. The EPA recommends additional screening for levels above 1 mg/kg.
In a separate collection of “wipe” samples of indoor and outdoor surfaces, the maximum detectable concentration on an indoor surface was 8.6 micrograms per 100 square centimeters, while the maximum detectable concentration on an outdoor surface was 104 micrograms per 100 square centimeters. The EPA has set a threshold of 10 micrograms per 100 square centimeters for nonporous indoor surfaces.
The PCBs were largely concentrated in the exterior caulking used for waterproofing, though low concentrations of PCBs were also found in some apartments, according to the Harvard Real Estate Services notice released Wednesday.
When in high quantities, PCBs—man-made chemicals which were commonly used in buildings built between the 1950s and 1970s and are also often found in fish—can cause cancer and harm the immune system, short-term memory, and cognitive skills of children exposed to the chemical in while in the womb.
Of the dozens of apartment complexes that Harvard offers graduate students, Peabody Terrace is particularly geared toward married couples with children—complete with a daycare center and playground areas.
After the production of PCBs peaked in 1970, Congress banned PCB manufacture in 1976 after the chemical’s toxicity emerged as an issue of concern.
Some students—such as Silvia Cruz, a joint-degree student at Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School—expressed concern about the findings.
“The place is a dump,” she said. “They promised tiled floors—we got linoleum [floors] and concrete walls. There’s holes in the walls. It was dirty when we moved in.”
“I hate that place—I want to move out,” Cruz added.
Deegan said that the EPA will receive and review the details of the Peabody Terrace case at an “expedited” pace in the coming weeks.
But Poupore wrote in an e-mailed statement that since the PCB levels at Peabody Terrace are “unlikely to result in any substantial exposure or elevated health risks...Harvard does not believe that relocation of or compensation for residents will be necessary.”
There is no agreed-upon threshold PCB concentration that everyone considers hazardous, according to Donna J. Vorhees, a Boston-based environmental consultant.
“Whether anything adverse would happen in the concentration people are exposed to in the indoor environment is a question mark right now,” said Vorhees, who explained that buildings are examined for PCBs only on a case-by-case basis. “Nobody, as far as I know, has done a systematic survey of buildings in the U.S.”
Harvard will continue the three-year repair and waterproofing project that prompted the PCB discovery, according to Poupore.
Some graduate students living in the concrete complex—which has a 99 percent occupancy rate—said they are not too concerned about the discovery of PCBs in their building.
“I’m not that worried about it,” said Kayoung Kim, a student at the Graduate School of Education, explaining that the flyer he had seen Wednesday emphasized that the PCB levels found were not hazardous.

A new Harvard Medical School study recommends that patients with advanced dementia be given the same quality care as patients with terminal illnesses such as cancer or heart failure.
The study, led by Associate Professor of Medicine Susan L. Mitchell, followed 323 patients with advanced dementia in 22 different nursing homes for 18 months.
Through interviews with the patients, their families, and the nursing homes’ caretakers, the researchers found that patients with end-stage dementia did not receive an ideal quality of care for their condition.
“Infections and eating problems were hallmark for patients [with advanced dementia],” said Mitchell, who is also a senior scientist at Hebrew SeniorLife (HSL), a Harvard Medical School affiliate. “Far too many patients received stressing symptoms, and the care they receive at the end of life has not been optimal, in part because they have not been recognized as [having] a terminal illness.”
While previous studies have focused only on the causes and medicinal treatments of dementia in its earlier stages, Mitchell’s study is the first to investigate dementia at its end stage, referred to as “stage 7.”
According to the Global Deterioration Scale, stage 7 is the stage of dementia characterized by not only profound memory deficits but also the inability to recognize family members, communicate verbally, walk, or feed oneself.
“When someone has advanced cancer, if they have any discomfort, we’ve no hesitation about treating them or doing things to tend to their comfort. They become the utmost priority in our mind,” said Sharon Inouye, professor of medicine and director of the Aging Brain Center at HSL.
“But one of the most painful things to me was how often these patients [with advanced dementia] were allowed to be uncomfortable or allowed to have distressing symptoms,” Inouye said.
As a result, Mitchell’s paper—published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine—recommends expert management for palliative care in addition to awareness of the seriousness of the disease at the end stage.
“Our study calls for improved communication with patients and family members so they understand what to expect in the final stages [of dementia] to make decisions of care with their patients,” Mitchell said.
Inouye added that the next step should must involve “trying to give appropriate care in the appropriate setting.”
“To me,” she said, “the take-home message [is] the realization that patients with advanced dementia really have a terminal illness.”

Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul A. Volcker harshly criticized financial engineering and emphasized the need to return to a more production-based economy in a speech last night at the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
Volcker—who also serves as chairman of the newly formed Economic Recovery Advisory Board—spoke before a packed audience and fielded questions about the state of the economy.
In his speech, the 1951 graduate of Harvard School of Public Administration (the precursor to the Kennedy School), stressed that many of the causes of the recession have not been fully repaired.
“I don’t think we will have a sustainable recovery unless we deal with the underlying structural issues,” Volcker said.
He pointed to the proliferation of financial engineering techniques—such as credit derivatives and credit default swaps—as methods of “taking bad paper and making it look like good paper.”
Volcker also expressed fears about the government rescue of troubled banks. He argued in favor of a system in which the government could take over faltering institutions to prevent collapse—with the ultimate goal of dissolving such financial groups.
Volcker’s speech began somewhat inauspiciously, as the audience initially struggled to hear him.
“He is 6 foot 7, so he was too tall for the microphone on the podium to record him,” explained Christopher J. Hollyday ’11, the chair of the IOP Forum Committee. Volcker, nicknamed “Tall Paul,” was quickly fitted with a personal microphone instead.
Following his speech, Volcker spent nearly an hour answering questions from the audience about the lessons that could be learned from the economic meltdown.
When Adam B. Chepenik, a student at HKS and Harvard Business School, asked Volcker for his advice to students, the former Fed Chair discouraged young audience members from going into the world of finance.
“Producing something real can be as much of a challenge as making a million dollars in the financial market,” he said.
Following the event, Grant N. Wonders ’12 said he was pleased with Volcker’s ability to respond to a wide array of questions.
“He did a good job of bridging the gap between an academic perspective and applying practicality in a modern economy,” Wonders said.
Hollyday said he was similarly impressed by Volcker’s talk.
“It was really cool to hear such a giant in economics speak about the current crisis,” he said.

Harvard University Health Services expects its first delivery of H1N1 influenza vaccine to arrive in about two or three weeks, although the number of people being diagnosed with influenza-like illnesses at UHS has declined slightly this week, according to UHS officials.
When the vaccine arrives, UHS will first distribute it to groups designated as high-priority by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—including pregnant women, medical services personnel, and caretakers of young children—said UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59.
UHS has a list of about 300 to 400 people who qualify as high-risk according to CDC guidelines.
“Everyone wants to get it and will be clamoring for it,” Rosenthal said of the H1N1 vaccine. “If we have a limited supply, we need to make sure we get it to people who are high-risk first.”
The state has not given UHS many details about the arrival date of the vaccine or how much vaccine will be provided initially, beyond a promise that the vaccine would arrive “soon,” Rosenthal said, though he expects to receive a limited amount of the vaccine by the beginning of November.
About 300 people, mainly undergraduates, have been diagnosed with influenza-like illness by UHS since the end of August. Rosenthal said there have been about 50 new cases per week until this week, when there has been a slight decline in the number of people diagnosed.
The American College Health Association reports that regional outbreaks of influenza-like illness seem to have already peaked in the Northeast. There were 30 percent fewer new cases in Massachusetts last week compared to two weeks ago, according to the Association.
But Rosenthal said some healthcare professionals are anticipating two peaks.
“We just have to wait and see,” he said.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health no longer recommends testing to distinguish H1N1 flu from seasonal flu, so students who have flu symptoms are simply diagnosed with an influenza-like illness. According to Rosenthal, testing at other colleges has revealed that 75 to 80 percent of flu cases are H1N1.
Massachusetts is not yet distributing injectable H1N1 vaccine, though the state has been giving out an intranasal spray vaccine with live H1N1 flu virus. Rosenthal said that UHS has only ordered injectable vaccines with dead virus because live virus is not safe for use in high-risk groups.
UHS continues to focus on isolating students diagnosed with influenza-like illness.
Students who live within two to three hours of campus are advised to recover at home, and students with single bedrooms can opt to return to their rooms.
Stillman Infirmary accommodates up to 15 students, and UHS has located 38 empty bedrooms throughout the House system in which to isolate additional sick students without single bedrooms.

A new Harvard study may open the possibility of using human stem cells to regenerate diseased or damaged hearts.
Led by Medical School Professor Kenneth R. Chien ’73, the project—published in today’s issue of Science—was a collaborative effort of scientists at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The team used a mouse cardiac stem cell to develop a functioning, intact strip of mouse heart muscle, raising the possibility that such cardiac stem cells can have regenerative capacity if manipulated appropriately.
Chien—the director of the Cardiovascular Research Center at Harvard-affiliate MGH—said that technology developed by SEAS Professor Kevin Kit Parker was integral to the team’s discovery.
“[Parker] created an imprint like Saran Wrap, and when cells are put on top of it, they can be forced into a pattern,” Chien said. “We take cells we have isolated to form strips of functioning muscle. It’s like a Band-Aid for the heart, and cells line up just the way you want them to.”
Chien said this is the first time someone has been able to make a functional muscle in a mature conformation by facilitating the transition from a pluripotent embryonic stem cell—a cell that has the capacity to differentiate into any other cell type—to heart tissue.
Ibrahim J. Domian, the first author on the paper and an HMS instructor, said color receptors were used to tag heart cells in a genetically-modified mouse embryo. This color-coding approach was used to identify and purify a rare daughter cell of a master heart stem cell that the researchers then used to make a an actual working heart muscle cell.
Beneath the film that Parker developed, cells can grow, and when they bunch up, scientists can measure and observe the cells’ transition from a mere collection of cells to actual muscle tissue.
Domian added that while the researchers only used mice for this study, their next step will be to generalize the results to humans.
Despite his team’s findings, Chien said he is “still in the early days” of his research.
His ultimate goal is to create a three-dimensional muscle, instead of just a two-dimensional set of cells. These cells would behave as fully functional cardiac and vascular cells, which could then be used to repair damaged hearts.

Thomas M. Michel ’77 has stepped down from his post as Harvard Medical School’s first Dean for Education, saying that current fiscal constraints have hampered plans to implement new interdisciplinary programs and other initiatives under his purview.
Michel was appointed just last year to develop new education programs across Harvard’s science schools and at the University’s affiliated hospitals. The Dean of Education post was created to implement curricular reforms suggested through a strategic planning process launched in Oct. 2007 by then-incoming Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier.
But current budget constraints have delayed implementation of several such reforms, including the Scholars in Medicine Program, which requires Medical School students to complete a research project, and HMS-PRIME, a Masters in Medical Science degree program.
The programs would have been funded in part by income from Harvard’s nearly $37 billion endowment, which fell a precipitous $11 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.
“Not long after I started, the bottom fell out,” Michel said. “We began looking toward sustaining our existing education programs rather than creating new ones.”
With the current hold on new programs, the position was no longer “appropriate,” said Michel, whose resignation was announced over the summer.
Michel said that some of the programs will be delayed for at least a year—or until the Medical School is on firmer financial footing.
For now, Flier has asked Michel to stay on as a special adviser for interdisciplinary education, and planning for the two programs will continue in the meantime.
“I have every confidence [the new programs] are going to see the light of day,” Michel said. “This is just a consequence of unseen fiscal challenges.”
Despite the temporary pause on new programming, the Medical School has been able to sustain core curricular activities by trimming expenses in other areas such as catering and printing costs, Dean for Medical Education Jules L. Dienstag wrote in an e-mailed statement.
During his short-lived tenure as dean, Michel oversaw the addition of several cross-listed course offerings to the curriculum and created the Leder Human Biology and Translational Medicine Program, a Ph.D. program in the life sciences.
He will remain on faculty and plans to continue leading the Leder program and conducting cardiovascular signal transduction research at Harvard-affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Melissa Hathaway, the Obama administration’s former top cybersecurity officer, officially took her place at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs on October 1, where she know serves as a senior advisor to the Center’s Project Minerva.
The project is a joint Harvard, MIT, and Department of Defense cybersecurity initiative designed to investigate the foreign policy and international relations aspects of cybersecurity.
Eric B. Rosenbach, the Belfer Center’s executive director for research, said that the committee brought Hathaway on due to her practical experience with cybersecurity within the sphere of government.
“We always try to work in the spirit of the Belfer Center, which is to produce policy-relevant research, science, and technology,” he said. “She’s a perfect fit with our mission.”
While working for both the Bush and Obama administrations, Hathaway played different roles in the formulation of cybersecurity policy under each head of state.
As the Bush administration’s Cyber Coordination Executive, she led a government-wide task force on the subject.
And as Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace for the National Security and Homeland Security Councils under Obama, Hathaway helped redefine the “cybersecurity czar” position, “since so many of the president’s initiatives have a strong cybersecurity component,” she said.
The new cybersecurity czar position, which the administration has yet to fill, will cooperate jointly with the National Economic Council and the National Security Council, viewed as a controversial move by some on the Beltway.
“In theory, you would have two bosses,” Hathaway said. “But there are others in the White House with dual reporting chains. You just have to treat it as a team.”
While some imagined that Hathaway herself would stay in the White House to serve as the new cybersecurity czar after her team concluded their report, she decided to leave for Cambridge.
“What attracted me to Harvard was the ability to work with students,” she said. “I thought if I could actually interface with students and tell them about the program’s shortfalls, we could start harvesting new ideas in Washington.”
Project Minerva—the first initiative of its kind at Harvard—consists of various professors and officials interested in cybersecurity from the university’s various schools, including Rosenbach, the Kennedy School’s Richard Clarke and Joseph S. Nye, and the Law School’s Jack L. Goldsmith.
“Melissa Hathaway is a real expert with great policy energy around cyber security questions—that are cutting edge for US national security,” wrote Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who is currently the director of the National Economic Council, in an e-mailed statement. “This will make her a real asset to the Belfer center.”

Imagine playing Kill the Carrier on an open field. Now imagine playing it with 300-pound men. And you have the ball.
That’s what junior quarterback Collier Winters will be facing this weekend when the Crimson (3-1, 2-0 Ivy) takes on Lafayette (4-1).
“They have a really good secondary,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They like to blitz like crazy, so [it’s] very tough to predict what they’re going to do as well.”
This philosophy has brought the Leopards victories against Yale, Penn, and Columbia.
“They’re always good when we play them,” Murphy said. “I think three out of the past six years they’ve been Patriot League champions and gone to the playoffs. They’re definitely a better team than they were a year ago and they were very good a year ago.”
The heart of Lafayette
Imagine playing Kill the Carrier on an open field. Now imagine playing it with 300-pound men. And you have the ball.
That’s what junior quarterback Collier Winters will be facing this weekend when the Crimson (3-1, 2-0 Ivy) takes on Lafayette (4-1).
“They have a really good secondary,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They like to blitz like crazy, so [it’s] very tough to predict what they’re going to do as well.”
This philosophy has brought the Leopards victories against Yale, Penn, and Columbia.
“They’re always good when we play them,” Murphy said. “I think three out of the past six years they’ve been Patriot League champions and gone to the playoffs. They’re definitely a better team than they were a year ago, and they were very good a year ago.”
The heart of Lafayette is a dominating, blitz-oriented defense.
“A lot of defenses give away what they’re doing before the snap, but they do a pretty good job disguising it,” Winters said. “It’ll be good practice. [Blitzing is] something that we have struggled with and we need to work on.”
The Leopards’ defense includes senior linebacker Mark Leggiero, a two-time All-Patriot League selection and this year’s preseason player of the year. Leggiero was also named Patriot League Defensive Player of the Week after his performance against Brown, in which he had 12 tackles, nine of which were solo efforts.
“When we’ve played them I think four out of the last five years, they’ve ranked in the top 10 in total defense and they’re right there again this year,” Murphy said.
A win against Harvard would give Lafayette its first 4-0 season record against the Ivy League schools in school history.
The Crimson, meanwhile, is looking to continue its three-game trend of winning with increasing margins.
In these wins, Harvard has demonstrated versatility in its attack.
“I think in the past games, we’ve shown that we can either run the ball or pass the ball,” junior wide-out Marco Iannuzzi said. “Now we want to do both in one game.”
Harvard hasn’t been pushed to deploy all of its weapons in its three victories but may have to this weekend.
In the last two weekends against Cornell and Lehigh, it was the running game that got the offense going.
Against the Big Red, junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales combined for 251 yards and 4 touchdowns.
In the game against the Mountain Hawks with Gordon and Scales out, senior Cheng Ho led the way with 132 yards on 21 carries. Meanwhile, Winters was the star of Harvard’s night time thriller against Brown, throwing for 223 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for another.
“Having our two dimensions [on attack] helps us wi th the edge in getting us more versatile,” Ho added.
If the weather is as predicted, the Crimson may have to rely on its running game more.
“We’re football players, and we’re based out of Boston,” Iannuzzi said. “So if you’re not used to the weather, better get used to it quick.”
Iannuzzi does concede that rain could change the offense and the scoring.
“Weather conditions can obviously change the game, but it’s not a disadvantage,” he said. “Both teams are forced to run. Both teams have to deal with the same adversity.”
“If it’s a crummy day, it’s going to be a low-scoring game,” Murphy said. “Because both defenses are good, and if by weather or other ways, teams are forced to play one handed, you become predictable.”
Perhaps if the weather is bad enough to interfere with fans’ vision, it could become possible to confuse the two teams’ similar three-man rushing attacks.
“They literally have played, like us, three backs,” Murphy said. “So it doesn’t matter who’s in there, they can all carry the football. At least two of them have breakaway type of speed so there’s no question that if the weather gets bad, we’re going to have to keep those guys under wraps.”
“The key to their offense is going to be stopping the run,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “I think the real battle is their offensive line versus our defensive line. The real battle is going to be holding the line of scrimmage.”
Harvard’s defensive line will have to fight through offensive linemen that Murphy estimates to weigh an average of 300 pounds.
“Patriot [League] linemen tend to be a little bigger,” Ehrlich said.
On both sides of the ball, the Crimson will face a talented Lafayette team that intends to go undefeated in Ivy League play.
“We had a great week of preparation,” Iannuzzi said. “I think we’re well prepared.”

Take a look at the Harvard men’s water polo team’s lineup and something clearly stands out–other than a few players from Eastern Europe or New England, the Crimson’s roster is remarkably dominated by Californians.
“There’s something about the team, the fact that most of us have the shared experience of not being from east coast places,” goalie Nikhil Balaraman said. “We can commiserate in the snow and all that terrible stuff that none of us had seen before.”
Balaraman is a senior originally from the San Diego area, who despite the drastic change in weather, has established himself as an important part of the water polo team here at Harvard.  That said, he doesn’t limit his play to sports. Balaraman and his roommate showed off their philanthropic sides by offering their services as a package deal at Kirkland’s Date Auction last night.
But back to the pool, where Balaraman works on a different game.
While Balaraman admits this season isn’t going quite as planned, head coach Erik Farrar points out that the keeper’s play has been one of the bright spots.
“He’s been a big part of the positive things that have been going on this season, and we’re hoping for a big finish to his senior year,” Farrar said in regards to the goalie.
These kinds of commendations are especially notable considering the shoes that Balaraman and sophomore teammate Alexandre Popp were asked to fill as the fall season began. The two are taking the place of one of the Crimson’s most storied water polo players, Jay Connolly, who graduated as part of the Class of 2009.
“The thing about Jay is that, if we’d had a better season last year—not even a winning season, say something close to a .500 season—Jay would’ve been All-American. Without question,” Balaraman stated with confidence.
Connolly was known by his teammates for an inspiring work ethic and a silent leadership that all respected.
“You always tried to emulate what he did, because you wanted to been seen in that light,” Balaraman reflected. “It was like, ‘Oh if Jay can do it, we should be able to do at least half of that.’ He’s kind of ridiculous.”
Teammates and coaches alike recognize that Balaraman has stepped up to the bar that players like Connolly set at impressive heights.
“To have a keeper like Jay, who is the man, no doubt leaves a bit of a shadow,” Farrar said. “Nikhil has worked really hard the past couple years and has done a good job of filling that spot.”
“Jay and Nikhil play two very different styles, but are both great goalies,” co-captain Egen Atkinson added. “[Nikhil] has come up with some huge games for us in the goal. He’s a more vocal leader for the defense.”
In reference to his teammates’ praise regarding his leadership, Balaraman says it just part of the job as a keeper.
“A lot of playing goalie, its mentally being able to not let what happens get to your head,” he said. “You’re the last guy there for your teammates so you think, ‘I just want to make this stop so they have the opportunity to go score a goal.’”
Balaraman is also quick to give credit to the rest of the team. After taking a break from the sport during his sophomore year, he realized that the people involved were what really made him want to play.
“[My teammates] are all great people,” Balaraman said. “I mean that’s the reason we stay together…that’s the reason I came back to the team.”
The goalie’s teammates were eager to point out their peers’ successes and constantly give accolades to one another.
“It’s just a little love fest,” Atkinson joked.
This kind of back-and-forth complimenting and sense of community is something that has become commonplace amongst the Harvard water polo players.
Atkinson continued the trend when he added, “Nikhil’s one of my best friends. He’s a very funny guy, very motivated, definitely going to be successful at whatever he chooses to do further on in life.”
For now Balaraman is focused on the team’s upcoming game against Fordham this Saturday. As the year’s last conference game, it is crucial to determine the Crimson’s position in postseason play.
“Saturday is a must win,” Balaraman said. “The last few times they’ve played us, they’ve just had our number or something. So for us, it’s pissing us off,” he noted with a laugh.
Although he keeps a lighthearted attitude towards the sport and his teammates, as a leader on the Crimson defense and the team as a whole, Balaraman is determined to finish the season strong—and get a good meal out of the highest bidder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parity is the name of the game in Ivy League football these days.
Since this year’s seniors were freshmen back in the 2006 season, four different teams have won at least a share of the Ancient Eight title—Harvard, Yale, Brown, and Princeton—while Penn and Cornell have at least remained competitive throughout that time.
This year, the Ivy crown is as up for grabs as ever. Harvard’s on top with its 2-0 record in conference play, but the winner of tomorrow’s Columbia-Penn game will soon join the Crimson. The Lions in particular have been exciting to watch, shaking off their long-time role as the Ivy League’s punching bag under the leadership of head coach Norries Wilson.
Yale and Cornell form the middle of the pack at 1-1. The Big Red is unlikely to threaten anyone this year, but the Bulldogs—while removed from their customary spot on the short list of top Ivy title challengers—should at least keep opponents on their toes and end the season with a respectable record.
Of the three teams yet to add a league victory to their names—Brown, Princeton, and Dartmouth—it’d be nearly impossible to throw either of the latter two squads into a discussion of contenders with a straight face. But Brown’s Ivy loss came to Harvard in a close game, and the Bears defiantly discouraged their detractors from dismissing them last week by upsetting then-No. 20 Holy Cross.
I picked the Crimson to win the Ivies before the season, and I stand by that prediction, not because I’m a shameless homer (which wouldn’t be an entirely ridiculous accusation), but because I truly believe that Harvard is the team to beat. But while I expect the Crimson to take the Ancient Eight title, it certainly wouldn’t shock me if it didn’t.
The Ivy League football season reaches its halfway point tomorrow, and there are a good number of teams in the league who aren’t half bad, and possibly even better than that.
PRINCETON (1-3, 0-1 IVY) AT BROWN (2-2, 0-1 IVY)
Last week, Brown’s Kyle Newhall-Caballero found himself in a place no Ivy League quarterback wants to be: in a shootout with Holy Cross’s juggernaut of a quarterback, Dominic Randolph.
Randolph, the two-time defending Patriot League player of the year, has devoured defenses from his sister conference, and this time was no different. The future NFL draft pick went 38-for-53 against the Bears for 411 yards and four touchdowns.
But “El Caballero” was better, at least when it counted. The first-year starter completed 46 of 61 passes for 431 yards and two scores to lead Brown to a 34-31 victory.
After taking on Randolph, somehow I don’t think Newhall will be too concerned when he faces off against Princeton’s Tommy Wornham tomorrow.
Prediction: Brown 30, Princeton 21
FORDHAM (2-3) AT CORNELL (2-2, 1-1 IVY)
The matchup to watch here is between Fordham quarterback John Skelton and the Cornell secondary.
If the aforementioned Randolph is the No. 1 quarterback in the Patriot League, Skelton is 1A. In five games, he’s thrown for a gaudy 1,525 yards and 10 touchdowns.
But Cornell’s pass D is ranked second in the Ivy League, and the Big Red might have as good of a chance as any team of holding Skelton down. On the other hand, Cornell’s rushing defense is virtually nonexistent, and Fordham boasts a pretty decent ground attack, as well.
This game seems destined to be a high-scoring affair one way or another, and the Big Red just doesn’t have the horses to keep up with the Rams.
Prediction: Fordham 35, Cornell 27
YALE (2-2, 1-1 IVY) AT LEHIGH (1-4)
Lehigh has been getting kicked around all season, and it finally got a gift last week when Georgetown came to visit. But the party’s over now.
Yale is mediocre, but it if knows one thing, it’s how to beat up on bad teams, with blowout wins over Georgetown and Dartmouth. Lehigh is a bad team.
Prediction: Yale 28, Lehigh 14
DARTMOUTH (0-4, 0-2 IVY) AT NO. 24 HOLY CROSS (4-1)
Remember that whole thing about Dominic Randolph getting outgunned by an Ivy League quarterback? Yeah, not going to happen again.
With all due respect to the actually good Alex Jenny—and for taking the ball for Dartmouth every Saturday and not deciding to just join the fraternity guys in the stands and get hammered so he could forget that he plays for Dartmouth, he’s due a lot of credit—Randolph is going to throw for enough yards for both of them to win their respective conference player of the week awards.
This is going to be ugly. Think Giants vs. Raiders ugly.
Prediction: Holy Cross 44, Dartmouth 7
PENN (2-2, 1-0 IVY) AT COLUMBIA (2-2, 1-0 IVY)
This is by far the most interesting matchup this week.
The Ivy League’s highest-scoring offense (Columbia) against its stingiest defense (Penn). Two teams that have won the games they’re supposed to win and stayed close in the games they’re supposed to lose. A chance for one of these programs to put itself ahead of the pack in the Ivy League title race.
It’s really impossible to tell who’s going to win this one, but I’ve been high on Columbia the whole season, and the Lions are the home team anyway.
Prediction: Columbia 17, Penn 14
LAFAYETTE (4-1) AT HARVARD (3-1, 2-0 IVY)
Just to reiterate how tight the Columbia-Penn game is going to be, both teams lost to a very good Lafayette squad by three points this season.
As for the Leopards, like Harvard, they’re a borderline Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division 1-AA) Top-25 team, having garnered two votes in the polls this week.
This should be a very close matchup, and Crimson coach Tim Murphy is predicting that weather and the quality of the teams involved will turn this into a low-scoring game. I’m not going to argue.
Prediction: Harvard 13, Lafayette 10
Last Week: 4-2
Record to Date: 16-10

Future YDN-reporter Jacob: “Have you been reading my blog?”
Stunning young ingénue Rachel: “Of course not. You’re a gossip monger, and your blog is nothing but trash and lies.”
Read on for this week's trash and lies (spoliers ahead).
When Will and Sue decide to each direct their own numbers for sectionals, Sue realizes that “the minority students” are feeling unheard, and decides to sow discord, picking an all-minority team and finally allowing Kurt and Mercedes to “try something a little more black.” Drama ensues. After publicly accusing Mr. S. of “bigotry” and burning his music, Sue vows to get him fired. On his lovable wife’s advice, Mr. Schue gets “down in the gutter” and flunks almost all the Cheerios. Turns out girls are “functionally illiterate” -- one misspelled her name and drew sombreros as her answers in Will’s Spanish class. Surprisingly, Principal Figgins finally puts his foot down, ending Sue’s “free passes.” He even forbids her from picking up and throwing a child during her ensuing tantrum! Is there no end to his tyranny?
Meanwhile, Finn and Quinn are growing apart, and it gets nasty. “Why can’t you be more about Rachel?” he snaps. Quinn pounces on the competition, but Rachel won’t have any of it, and calling her out for working against glee with Sue: “Every time you whisper in her ear, you empower her to do more damage.” Last week it was sweet when Rachel tried to present New Directions as a refuge, but she’s quickly finding it empowering that glee will be Quinn’s only sanctuary when Sue finds out about the baby. In related news, Terri and her awful, awful sister Kendra exploit small-town dynamics and bully the local obstetrician into performing a fake sonogram for Will to attend. “I’ve been a really crummy wife lately,” says Terri. O RLY? Sue and Schue eventually shout it out, and Will tears her apart: “You have no class. … You spend every waking moment of your life figuring out ways to terrify children to make yourself feel better about yourself and the fact that you’re probably going to spend the rest of your life alone.” Sue steps down as glee co-chair (although she chooses to retain consigliere privileges), and then confronts Quinn about her pregnancy. Rachel had been keeping Jacob quiet with panty payments, but once he let the news slip to Sue, the coach forces him to publish on his blog. With her popularity threatened, and with possibly nothing left but glee, Quinn is distraught, and the club rallies around her in the final number.
Musical Numbers
“Hate on Me” by Jill Scott
This forgettable number lacks a center. We realize the scene is supposed to be a first-run, justifying the visual aimlessness, but the song’s emotional footing is uncertain as well. The performance is happy without capturing a sense of empowerment. It’s just flat, and we know Amber Riley can sing, so we’re not sure what went wrong. The choreography somewhat comes together halfway through – FlyBy enjoyed Mercedes walking along on those chairs – but what in the world did they have Kurt doing?
C
“Ride wit Me” by Nelly feat. City Spud
YES. This attempts the same serendipitous, organic feel, but gets it right. The choreographed scene looks unplanned, or at least believable, and that’s a hard task, as Expressions learned this week. The enthusiasm in the nostalgic jam session makes glee look like the funnest class ever, proving the show isn’t just production values smoke-and-mirrors. Our only caveat: it’s a little problematic that the two modern, “black” pieces in this diversity episode weren’t actual performances. We got an unplanned rehearsal and a jam sesh vs. major production numbers. Awks.
A for effort
“No Air” by Jordin Sparks with Chris Brown
Thanks to Will’s orders to practice even “between classes” we’re treated to a hilarious school-hallway-as-music-video-wind-tunnel situation, and we completely approve. Rachel’s great here, and Quinn’s seething is perfect, but Finn’s heavily autotuned voice is distracting. Still it's an enjoyable number. However, FlyBy is vehemently opposed to anything that sanctions the continued career of the monster that is Chris Brown.
F
“You Keep Me Hangin’ On” by The Supremes
This furious and sexually frustrated dream sequence comes straight out of nowhere, and it’s powerful. The mixing on Quinn’s voice is a little weak, but otherwise her performance is tough as she punches her way through the number. Throw in some Cheerios in football uniforms as backup and we have the episode’s showstopper.
A-
“Keep Holding On” by Avril Lavigne
The previews made us think this song was in response to something happening with Quinn’s baby. We think it’s a bit much given the situation. Also, Avril? Really? Luckily, while the mangled syllables are still there, the arrangement is a big improvement. Dubbing an Avril echo onto an Avril voice track doesn’t do much for us, but having the chorus of guys echo the girls wrests emotions from the song that were absent in the original. The choreography melds all the cliques well, but that last bit of hand-holding… what did that even mean?
B+/A-
Missing Plotlines
Sue’s Corner
Setting Sue, “mighty Greek warrior,” to Carmina Burana was brilliant. We hope someone got promoted. Also fun: a double-headed coin, threats of vomit, an ability to smell failure, and an increasingly improbable biography. We are now to believe she is a Comanche and a former VJ. Sue’s idea of “empowerment” is “irrational, random terror,” and she finds “psychosexual derangement” to be “fascinating.”
This week’s best lines
Roll call of minorities: “Santana. Wheels. Gay kid. ... Asian. Other Asian. Aretha. And Shaft.”
Advice to Harvard students?: “If they want to be bankers, and lawyers, and captains of industry, the most important lesson they could possibly learn is how to do a round off.”
On puns: “That is a lawsuit, mister! I will Sue your ass!”
On Brittany’s heritage: “Oh, I know the Dutch are famous for being a cold people, but that’s no excuse for [Will] treating you like some half-priced hooker in Amsterdam’s famous red-light district.”
On inclusion: “Sue Sylvester’s rainbow tent will gladly protect you from [Will’s] storm of racism.”
The Short Version
So many different stories came to a head this week! FlyBy loved all the confrontations. We enjoyed the “empowerment” theme, too, but we’re unsure about the show’s handling of minorities. This has been a problem from the beginning: Kurt’s coming out, for example, was handled with surprising respect. But are we to read Mr. Ryerson as a villainous pedophile or as an offensive gay stereotype? “Throwdown” addresses these issues with mixed results, succeeding in being considerate yet funny, but failing to deepen the most stereotyped characters. We like that Mercedes’ dad is a dentist, but having her announce “I may be a strong, proud black woman but I’m a lot more than that” does nothing in actuality to flesh the character out. Regardless of communities or boundaries, though, surely we can agree that Drizzle is a terrible baby name?
Overall: A-. Attempts to work out portrayals of minorities. Plenty of Sue. Plenty of drama. Plenty of music.

Head of the Charles: festive two-day rowing event drawing thousands of crew-loving spectators, or corporate-sponsored carnival and glorified prep reunion with overpriced fried dough for the masses?
Once upon a time, Head of the Charles actually seems to have been somewhat fun: alcohol flowed freely along the banks of the Charles, and hordes of prep school grads descended on Cambridge to treat themselves to things quite unrelated to crew.
But now, for those of us unfamiliar (or uninterested) with the sport, the event's highlights tend to be limited to the candy corn, clam chowder, and free Nantucket Nectars samples lining the race. Alumni groups might have a better time, with the "Reunion Village" providing food and schmooze and selling beer and wine. Read more about this year's highlights after the jump.
This year's event promises to be even more exclusive than in the past: the "Eliot Bridge Enclosure," a "controlled-access hospitality tent" requiring either a $60 one-day pass or a $100 two-day pass, provides "early morning coffee and breakfast items and a delicious gourmet buffet luncheon including two gratis bar drink tickets." Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar is reportedly providing this "distinctive dining experience."
FlyBy wonders if these new perks are related to Head of the Charles' financial issues—seems that entry fees and corporate sponsorship isn't cutting it anymore, and that donations will be needed to keep the regatta "thriving" for future generations. Jim Connelly, a spokesman for the event, said that some sponsorships have been scaled back from last year, but that "budget issues are not anything concerning."
All of this to say that FlyBy will probably still stop by, if for nothing else than to stock up on free goodies. (Yoga mats, anyone?) But with wintry temperatures and two snow/rain storms barreling towards the Northeast this weekend, even that may be a stretch.

PBHA is hoping you do—and rightly so, FlyBy thinks. Rarely does a day go by that is void of dreams of our grandmother's shameless spoiling and coddling, and her special bean paste stew (well, maybe that concerns just a select few of us).
With that in mind, it's hard to ignore PBHA's heart-warming notices over the house lists, encouraging students to join the Elderly Affairs Committee, which conducts the Elderly 1-2-1 and Vernon Hall Nursing Home programs.
The message cuts to the chase—and it ends up right in the core of that soft, plump mass called your heart (yes, you have one; we know it's hard to tell sometimes):
That's a good question. After all, good deeds shouldn't have to stay within the bloodline, right? Find out why you might want to consider adopting a third (or fourth?) grandma (in concept) for yourself, after the jump.
According to Daniel E. Lage '10, co-director of the Vernon Hall volunteer program, PBHA hopes to recruit new volunteers through its publicity efforts; though PBHA has a sprawling membership, about only 20 volunteers work with the elderly, he says.
But the organization is also trying to raise awareness of elderly issues and to honor the "legacy" of senior citizens, regardless of whether they constitute family. Lage says of his volunteer work: "It is almost like having my grandparents here."
"We're trying to say, 'Let's take a step back.' As Harvard students, what can we do to honor their legacy and to contribute to elderly needs?" he says, adding that the need for cognizance of elderly issues becomes all the more significant as the nation grows older.

Friday, October 16, 2009, a date which will live in infamy—or absurdity, depending on your point of view.
At 3:30 this afternoon, a team of Physics department students, faculty, and administrators were set to challenge the Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) department to a game of Ultimate Frisbee, in hopes of settling a rivalry with origins as clear as the problem sets these guys tackle on a regular basis.
“We just thought it would be fun,” said Kenneth H. Gotlieb ’10, a physics concentrator in Mather House and co-president of the Society of Physics Students, which organized this clash of the titans.  “Plus, we’ve got a score to settle with EPS, so we thought it’d be better to take it out on the Frisbee field.”
And why, pray tell, does Physics have issues with EPS?
“They have awesome field trips,” Gotlieb said.
But EPS understands the rivalry differently. More on the rift after the jump.
According to Jennifer L. Middleton ’10, co-president of the GeoSociety, EPS concentrator, and Adams resident, the rivalry has emerged only as the result of Gotlieb's initial challenge.
“Since the challenge, there’s been a growing rivalry—Physics tried to prank us by hanging a banner saying ‘Physics Rocks’ in our department,” she said. “But we thought their banner was lame, and we retaliated by filling their office with rocks and our own banner.”
The event was advertised as an opportunity for faculty to join hands with students in defending their departments against the barbarians at the gate.
According to Gotlieb, David Morin, the Physics Department’s Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies, will be there, but FlyBy was unavailable to reach Morin as the match approached, perhaps because he was preparing to dominate on the field.
As for EPS, Middleton was unsure of which faculty members—if any—would come. “None of them contacted me, but who knows, maybe we’ll have a junior faculty member show up at the last minute.”
But Physics has a secret weapon—listed by Harvard College Facebook as a computer science concentrator—to reveal at the showdown.
“I don’t know if it’s safe for me to reveal who it is—he’s actually on the real ultimate Frisbee team,” said Gotlieb. “Actually, his name’s Devon [R.] Williams ['10].”

It's the weekend, and midterms are upon us. FlyBy thinks it's time for another round of Around the Ivies.
Two Dartmouth seniors dressed in suits have celebrated the inauguration of the Ivy League's first Asian-American president with a gangster rap video. For approximately 95 percent of the video, you get to watch Tommy Shanahan and Matt Applegate grin at how attractive they think they are. From the lyrics: "We're dealing with something unheard of in this Ivy elitist institution. No I'm just fooling; he left Harvard behind, so what your rhyme, there is no crying, this is Hanover's time." At the end, the video says in green letters, "Congratulations, President Kim. Welcome home."
Students at Princeton are lobbying for the administration to open a chastity center. The president of Princeton's abstinence society says it's necessary to help rectify "the current double standard by which the University implicitly gives its seal of approval to a more libertarian view of sexuality.” With Princeton's endowment down 23 percent and University President Shirley Tilghman telling the Princetonian she does not think there is ample reason for a chastity center to be established, FlyBy thinks the whole enterprise seems a tad unlikely.
The Ricci case starts over again in New Haven (Yale), with a black firefighter suing with the claim that New Haven's 2003 promotional exam unjustly prevented him from being promoted to lieutenant status.
More Ivy League news after the jump.Some Yale professors were apparently under the outlandish impression that they were required to teach at least one undergraduate course offering at some point, but the Yale Daily News unearths the shocking discovery that no such rule exists, especially when it comes to the sciences. As at Harvard, ladder faculty are simply required to teach, but not to teach undergraduates.
UChicago protesters managed to drown out former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's speech, which was supposed to last 20 minutes but ended up taking an hour and a half.
A man in his late 20s or early 3os looked into a girl's shower at Stanford, and in a separate incident another man has been peeping into the first-floor dorm rooms of a dorm called Narnia.
