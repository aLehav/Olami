After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is often noted that our age values novelty to at least the occasional exclusion of truly worthy aesthetics. Unhappily, this was the case in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Oscar Wilde’s “Salomé,” directed by Yigit P. Sezener ’17, which ran in the Cabot House Theater from March 6 to 8. “Salomé” is a monument of late Victorian fin-de-siècle literature, presenting the biblical story of a dancing girl who uses her allure to persuade her stepfather, King Herod, to execute the prophet John the Baptist. Before the astonished eyes of the audience, the integrity of the text was mashed to an ignominious death in Sezener’s bizarre staging, featuring a set that looks like a 19th-century imperialist conception of a Chinese court, a Salomé clad in Lolita fashion, and overacted line-delivery that would be expected in an amateur production of “Hamlet.” What was displayed in this production was not art. It was exploitation.
The viewers were greeted at the theater by pulsing house music and the more or less unexpected spectacle of three students who have dressed as BDSM strippers, dancing onstage in front of the projected visual component of what appeared to be a J-pop music video. While this ethos is perhaps sympathetic to Wilde’s Decadent aesthetic—indeed, some might argue that the current era is ripe for a revival of Decadence and symbolism—this production’s execution was unsound. Rather than build the atmospheric darkness appropriate to Wilde’s text and the gruesome biblical event that it describes, the set’s chains, blow-up dolls, dildos, duct tape, and speedos produce a comical effect somewhere between a “Rocky Horror Picture Show” convention and a stereotyped crime-show sex-dungeon. Over this is a strange Orientalist veneer of Chinese lanterns, fans, and brocades crudely painted over with calligraphic characters. The ultimate end of this set is unclear; its proximate end seems to be the provision of a culturally shallow context appropriate to a Loli Salomé, played by Christine Pak ’17. The clutter of the stage lacked clear focus,and as a result, the eye wanders from the main action at any given point to the various pieces of sexual paraphernalia littering the set or to secondary characters who are inexplicably left on the stage during periods of important dramatic tension.
Good acting could have saved this production and even worked in conjunction with the ludicrous set to produce dark thematic dissonances. Unfortunately, the quality of acting presented only enhances the farcical nature of the production. It was unclear whether or not Sezener intended for there to be unrestrained laughter and tittering among the audience after the delivery of every single line in the final third of the play; whatever his intentions, this was the result. Pak’s Salomé manages to deliver a competent if unsubtle performance. The same cannot be said for the Herod played by Darius J. Altman ’17, whose performance is so purely buffoonish that the pathos of the unlucky king is lost in the cartoonish delivery of even the tragic lines in the text. His delivery is monotone—namely, shrieking—and his efforts to engage the audience directly were so clumsy that it was unclear if they were Sezener’s intention or an overenthusiastic improvisation. Nick T.J. Wood ’17 put in a good effort as Narraboth and gave the play the darkness it could use; sadly, his character is killed within ten minutes after the curtain rising. Maia R. Silber ’17, an active Crimson editor, played Herodias with a mechanical, ironical delivery that was very clearly deliberate and studied; since the reasoning for this directorial decision was obscure, the fact that her lines were invariably met with laughter cannot be reasonably lain at her feet.
The innovations on the text of Wilde’s “Salomé” were, like much else in this production, of unclear purpose. The most spectacular was the introduction of Judith (Elizabeth B.H. O’Donnell ’17), an angel who offers Herod salvation. This confusing insertion is naturally ridiculous, concluding with the emphatic statement “Fire and motherfucking brimstone!” While this utterance succeeded in drawing laughter from the audience, it was mysterious as to how it related to anything else that happens in the play—although, since the main thematic goals of this whole staging were so hopelessly muddled, it did not make much difference.
While it is difficult to enumerate the ills of this “Salomé,” its good qualities are easily named and explained. The single clearly interesting and effective decision in this production was the costuming of John the Baptist, played by Tom O. Marshall ’17. Clad in nothing but leopard-print briefs, a red wig, and a high black mourning hat with ostrich plumes, he was strikingly reminiscent of the painter Moreau’s well-known representation of Salomé. This is a productive reversal, casting John as the tempter, a much-ignored thematic undercurrent in Wilde’s play.
It is a hard task to make a conclusive statement on this production. If Sezener intended to make a farce of “Salomé,” he is a rare genius and has succeeded without condition. Unfortunately, a woman using her sexual influence over a family member to get a third party killed is pretty grim stuff, some of the grimmest stuff imaginable, and a farcical interpretation of such a plot does a violence to the text that should itself be condemned. If, on the other hand, farce was not the intended effect, dire mistakes were made, because unadulterated farce was the product. In either case, it can be agreed: this is a “Salomé” that can stay behind the seven veils.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“There's this idea that dessert should be pretty,” Dana Ferrante ’17 says. "Something about dessert makes people want to eat it, even if they're not hungry.” Speaking as one of several passionate bakers on Harvard’s campus, Ferrante’s remark epitomizes an approach to dessert-making that is common among serious practitioners. 
For culinary disciples of the sweet persuasion, whose areas of expertise range from cake decoration to bread making and from dessert blogging to culinary competitions, the art of dessert is far more than a simple pastime­. It is a standalone craft with its own culture of techniques, experts, and aesthetic trends—one that can serve as both an anchor of community and a creative outlet for the Harvard students who practice it.
  
PRETTY ENOUGH TO EAT
 
  One hour, two burners, two three-course meals, no appliances. Those are the limits set by the National ProStart Invitational, a culinary arts and restaurant management competition for teams of high school students. “I was sort of the designated dessert expert on our team,” says Ferrante, whose 2012 dessert earned seventh place in the nation and included a mug and saucer formed out of melted chocolate. A dessert made by Ferrante the following year consisted of maple-flavored whipped Bavarian cream—a dish with a mere 20-second window separating uncooked from overdone.
Ferrante’s team spent hours debating the look and shape of the mug and the plating of the dishes before the competition. “We had so many debates about the aesthetics of the cup—how big should the handle be, what shape should it be?” Ferrante says. “Even the cinnamon topping—do you need it? Probably not, but it makes it look so much nicer.” 
  When we meet at Lamont Café, Ferrante flips through the plan for a sustainable restaurant business model that her team put together for the restaurant management competition in 2013. She points to an apple, pear, and cheese dessert made with local cranberries and maple syrup. “This final product I think worked so well because it was symmetrical, and the glaze and cranberries go through the entire dish, which gives it a sense of unity," she says. "In the end, you can make something that tastes amazing, but if it doesn't look appealing you're going to need to persuade people to try it." 
  The aesthetic side of dessert-making is also important to Alec D. Yeh ’14. While still in high school, Yeh would sometimes arrive at Rancatore's Ice Cream where he worked in Belmont, Mass. at 3 a.m. to begin decorating ice cream cakes. "I really liked that solitary time," he says. "I would listen to music and be creative." As the unofficial "cake guy" at Rancatore's, which was founded by Joe Rancatore, the brother of the owner of the famed Toscanini's Ice Cream in Cambridge, Yeh clocked in hours of decorating that doubled as artistic education. On the job, Yeh learned about frosting, piping, and design. "My early cakes were abstract and color-based,” he says. “The owner really liked them and told me I could invest in more tools to make the cakes more intricate.” 
Cake decorating became an important part of Yeh's senior year of high school, something he discussed in his college interview for Harvard. When we need, he pulls out his phone and starts flipping through some pictures. "This is the cake I asked my prom date to prom with," he says, pointing out one photo. "This is the first time I worked with waffle cones…. This is a cake that was featured in the Boston Globe." Intricate piped frosting designs and angular waffle cones grace Yeh's creations, some of which look more like modern art than dessert.
The sensory appeal of dessert is also a central focus for Eliza Pan ’15, whose past creations on campus have included cakes incorporating piped frosting and stenciled powdered sugar, as well as a chocolate Kahlua cake made in a rice cooker in Pan’s tiny Currier kitchen. “The aesthetic side of the dessert is very important, and something I invest a lot of effort into—which is why some people think I’m an ‘amazing’ baker even if it only tastes ‘good!’” Pan says, laughing.
Largely self-taught, Pan comes from a Chinese family of accomplished cooks and says she was inspired to try dessert-making because of the relative lack of a dessert tradition in Chinese food culture. “I ended up improvising a lot, and I think this improvisation has helped my baking,” she says. Dessert-making also allows Pan to reconcile two different aspects of her personality. “With baking, a lot comes down to the science and the proportions…. I have a rational, scientific side, and a creative, improvisational side, and baking lies at that intersection.”
 
FEEDING COMMUNITY
 
  But the appeal of dessert-making isn’t just frosting-deep. At the Dudley Co-op, student bakers use their craft to help foster a sense of togetherness among the Co-op’s roughly 35-student population.
When I meet Matthew E. Stolz ’14 at the Co-op, his hair is tied back in a bandana and he's still wearing an apron from making that evening's dinner. Stolz takes a break from the bustle of the meal to greet me. "First of all,” he says, “Can I get you something to eat?" 
   After politely declining, I sit down with Stolz to talk dessert. Stolz learned to cook by making two meals a day, five days a week at Deep Springs College, a renowned alternative liberal arts school located in California. Stolz attended Deep Springs for two years before before transferring to Harvard. Meals Stolz prepared at Deep Springs included potatoes grown on campus, cow's brain soup, and tongue tacos ("People love them!"), made from Deep Springs' own cows. In comparison, making food for the Co-op's residents seems like, well, a piece of cake.
“When we did French pastries [at Deep Springs] we stayed up to 4 a.m. working on them. We'd rather bring sleeping bags to the kitchen than go back to our rooms,” Stolz says. “There were times I was cooking seven hours a day, even getting behind on my schoolwork.” Today, Stolz works hard to make his meals at the Co-op cohesive and tasty. "I don't really distinguish between cooking and baking,” he says. “For me, it's about making a whole menu…all the way down to the dessert at the end. Sometimes that doesn't happen—but you have to reach for the light of the ideal."
   Matthew C. Plaks ’14, another resident of the Co-op, credits the lifestyle of the Cooperative with enabling him to develop an interest in the culinary arts while at Harvard. The students living in the Co-op share the cost of buying food and take turns preparing meals. "Harvard isn't very conducive to getting people to realize they are interested in [baking] as a career,” Plaks says. “Personally, if I wasn't already paying dues to the Co-op, I wouldn't have had the funds to pursue this at the level that I am.” “This,” for Plaks, is bread-baking, a pastime that he delved into wholeheartedly after he moved to the Co-op last fall and baked his first loaf.
  “The reason I love bread baking is that bread is really a good anchor, or actor even, in creating community,” Plaks says. “I realized people would drop what they were doing as the smell of the bread [pulled] them into the room." In order to hone his bread-baking skills, Plaks pored over instructional videos and the commentary sections of cookbooks, even emailing renowned bread bakers for their tips. When we meet, he tells me about the series of precise creative decisions that go into making a bread, such as choosing the type of fat and considering the volume of liquid.
  Closely attentive to subtle differences among breads, Plaks speaks of sweet breads with hints of lemon, of crusts that reach a deep mahogany brown, of nuances in sandwich loaves and flours. He echoes the opinions of Yeh, Ferrante, and Pan, pointing to the importance of creating a dessert that is as visually appealing as it is tasty. "Aesthetics are a big part of the final product. Of course it's good if it tastes great, but [it’s] even better if it looks nice. It's one thing to make food that nourishes and sustains you, but it's another to have a level of refinement." As a VES concentrator who works primarily with photographs and videos, Plaks sees a qualitative difference between his work in these media and his culinary work. "Bread-baking is a much more intuitive and tactile and sensory experience [than video], so it's really nice to have that expression and sensation." 
 
VIRTUAL SWEETNESS 
 
  While the bakers at the Co-op aspire to please a small community with their creations, student bloggers at Harvard attempt to share their baking expertise with the world. Caroline T. Zhang ’16 founded the baking blog "Pass the Cocoa" with a friend when she was a senior at Carmel High School in Indiana. Zhang, who is an active Crimson news and design editor, says the blog has made her think differently about the presentation of food. "When I started, it was about baking cool things and snapping a picture and putting it online,” she says. “Now I'm much more into the photos and the presentation."
Victoria B. Piccione ’16 says she began baking when she was nine years old. “It got me in a lot of trouble!” she says with a smile. Today, Piccione is enthusiastic about sharing the process behind the foods she creates through her blog, “Sweet Dreams: Adventures in Baking.” “There's a story that comes with every baked good,” she says. 
  Piccione’s creative process begins with a concept and progresses through a sketch of the envisioned dessert in order to ensure that it looks as good as it tastes. "[Dessert-making] is appealing to me because you can make something that looks awesome, and then when you bite into it, it also tastes awesome…. That's so much better than something you just get to look at." More than any other dessert, Piccione loves making cake, which she decorates with fruit, frosting, or elegantly drizzled strands of chocolate. Piccione admits it's difficult to balance her passion for food with her other interests but points to baking as a way to alleviate stress and get her mind off her schoolwork.
While Piccione is adamant that she wants to keep baking after she graduates, she is unsure of exactly how it will figure into her future. Attending a Wintersession talk given by Joanne B. Chang ’91, the founder of Flour Bakery in Boston, provided Piccione with some helpful guidance. "It was great because I have idolized her for years,” she says. “[Chang] said, 'Don't plan on dropping out of here right now and starting your own bakery,'…. That was something I needed to hear."
 
MAKING DOUGH 
  If anyone can testify to the practicability of pursuing a career in baking after Harvard, it is Chang. Since its flagship location opened in Boston’s South End in 2000, Flour Bakery has become renowned for its delicious pastries. Rona Shen, a pastry chef at the Back Bay branch, says working in a professional setting presents an ever-changing set of challenges. "Ninety-five percent of our pastry chefs don't have formal training, though a few of the bakers on each team came from culinary school backgrounds," she says. "The advantage of not having formal training is we join the bakery as a clean slate. We can learn and absorb whatever Flour teaches us." 
All of Flour locations do basically the same decorations, though variations exist in piping design and fruit arrangement. While Shen says she no longer bakes very much at home, she is constantly on the lookout for innovative pastry ideas and new flavors. “The process of researching and tweaking [a] new product takes at least a month.” 
  Despite the logistical challenges of baking while on campus, some students are following in Chang’s footsteps while still in school and turning their passions into business ventures. Nina L. Hooper ’16 is one of the founders of the Holistic, a nonprofit organization which aims to create nutrient-dense desserts currently under development at the Harvard i-Lab. Hooper, an astrophysics concentrator, says the Holistic’s most recent product is a chocolate cake made of chickpeas rather than flour, and topped with avocado frosting. Every ingredient in a traditional cake recipe has been replaced with a healthier alternative.
  “Where the art comes in is that we know people want to see a certain thing, a certain color and texture,” says Hooper. “We have to be very careful about choosing ingredients and trying to replicate [desserts]. There is art in the design [and] in the flavor.” Hooper’s guinea pigs are freshman entryways, recruited by Hooper to sample and review her cakes at study breaks. “I really like the ‘wow!’ factor when people realize the cakes are made of healthy ingredients,” Hooper says. “Making these cakes is really an investigative process. The math is pretty basic, but there is an element of discovering the right proportions, of figuring out the chemical principles.” The founders of the Holistic hope to have its cakes sold in Harvard cafes and to give its profits to eating disorder awareness organizations. 
Ferrrante is also committed to making a career out of her passion for dessert—prior to starting Harvard, Ferrante was accepted to culinary school. She delayed her professional baking education in order to attend Harvard but has taken a food-related class every semester since she arrived on campus and has gotten involved with the Food Literacy Project and the Beekeepers' Association. Ferrante was tempted to try and bake professionally while at Harvard, but was unfortunately stymied by logistics.“There are so many bakeries and places to work at around Harvard, but they want you to work long shifts, work all weekend. And you really can't do that as a Harvard student.” 
 Scheduling concerns may not be the only factor on students’ minds when thinking about jobs in bakeries. “There have been times I’ve worked and made food in a professional setting, and I felt less invested,” Stolz says. “It’s not…a community that I know very well and love. It’s weird to churn out food for people I don’t know—but I could see myself going that way. I haven’t ruled it out.” 
 
A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN
 
Wielding pastry bags in lieu of paintbrushes, Harvard’s student food artists use their spare time to create elaborate and appealing desserts. Overwhelmingly self-driven and passionate, these dedicated bakers view their culinary work as far more than a hobby. In their capable, flour-dusted hands, dessert becomes a vehicle for self-expression and artistic experimentation. Like other artisans honing their skills, these culinary craftsmen have developed their products by tweaking recipes and being open to the possibility of failure. They’ve also taken steps to share their creations with larger audiences—people they care about and cook for, family and friends on special occasions, and even the general public through food blogging and business ventures. 
Though dessert-making is a field that demands patience and dedication, Stolz stresses that it is also accessible to newcomers. “People say they don’t know how to cook,” Stolz says. “But the truth is, if you know how to read, then you know how to cook.” Not all may reach a level of mastery on par with these culinary champions—but their craft may serve as an inspiration to tie on an apron.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The joke was quick to surface when, in his last scene on “Breaking Bad,” Aaron Paul’s character Jesse Pinkman drove off into the night in a souped-up muscle car: he was driving off to star in “Need for Speed,” a trailer for which had premiered in the middle of the episode. “I literally started this film the night I wrapped Breaking Bad,” Paul said with a hint of wonder in his voice. And that last scene? “ I drove straight from there into this movie.”
 
It’s no wonder, then, that Paul’s character, Tobey Marshall, seems to be Jesse Pinkman reincarnate. Tobey’s tragic arc even seems familiar: the gifted driver loses everything to his ex-partner in an illegal street race and, when released from jail, goes on a journey of revenge across the whole of the United States. Tobey is different from Jesse, of course. “Jesse was just so insecure, a tortured, easily manipulated, easy-to-beat-up kid,” Paul said. “And Tobey, I think he’s much stronger, confident, driven.” Yet somehow Tobey seems to be the inevitable conclusion to Pinkman, a Jesse after meth—mature, confident, and still authentic.
 
In fact, the real similarity between Paul’s two most popular characters to date is his ability to imbue them with a sense of humanity and realism that pervades the whole of “Need for Speed.” Jesse Pinkman was the human side of “Breaking Bad,” and in a movie about shiny, incredibly fast cars, Tobey Marshall manages to give the story a human edge. In fact, it almost seems like Aaron isn’t playing Jesse or Tobey at all. Aaron Paul is playing Aaron Paul, the personable, relatable man who seems to fall from the screen into real life. This tendency towards relatability and humanity is one of Paul’s greatest strengths, especially in “Need for Speed.”
 
While Tobey is behind the wheel, the supercharged Shelby GT500 so dangerously close to stealing the show is suddenly one with his character; he seems almost to personify the cars he drives and he draws the viewer into that experience. Tobey also happens to resemble one of Paul’s cinematic heroes: “Steve McQueen’s such a badass,” Paul gushed. “And I just love that he was a racer before he was an actor. And that was [Director Scott Waugh’s] whole pitch—he wanted to do a throwback to the films that really started this genre. ‘Bullitt,’ ‘Vanishing Point,’ ‘The Smoking Gun.’ And that’s what excited me. That we were really gonna do all these stunts without all the CGI.”
 
Perhaps the film’s lack of CGI is another reason why it lends itself to believability. When the Mustang jumps two lanes of traffic, when the car is airlifted by a military helicopter, when Paul himself slides the car to a stop mere inches from the camera—they all happened. Almost every stunt in the movie was real, and many were performed by Paul himself. In this way, “Need for Speed” differentiates itself from other movies of the car-racing genre—it seems to be about something real in a way that “The Fast and the Furious” franchise isn’t. Several times throughout the movie, the camera pans out to give the viewer a first-person view of the driver’s seat, giving the audience the sense that they are the driver. In the same way Paul was inspired by the coolness of Steve McQueen in “Bullitt,” the film aims to inspire the audience, showing them that all they need to be Tobey Marshall is a fast car and a white jean jacket.
 
Before the interview began, I considered asking Aaron if he ever felt as though he was playing a supporting character to the cars themselves. But it was only when I met the man that I realized he was, with brilliant perception, playing a supporting role to the experience.

“300” burst onto the pop culture scene eight years ago on a gush of computer-generated blood, earning itself a place in the artistic pantheon as the single most successful piece of exploitation cinema of the last decade. The spectacular visuals, absurd violence, and physically impossible action combined with gross historical inaccuracy, an ethos of machismo, and jingoistic undercurrents about democracy and Middle Eastern threats created the ideal film for the American teenage male, whose unfathomable appetites for stimulation are best satisfied by a steady stream of alternating images of blood and pornography, preferably justified by appeals to freedom. While much has changed in the intervening eight years, these appetites at least have remained a cultural constant. As a result, it is no surprise that the sequel, “300: Rise of an Empire,” directed by Noam Murro, provides a spectacle equal to its worthy predecessor.
 The central action of the new film is the Battle of Salamis, the 480 BCE naval engagement at which a Greek confederacy led by the Athenian Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) defeated the Persian Empire, deciding the outcome of the Persian Wars. As is to be expected, the established historical facts are blithely ignored in favor of unreal visuals. In an extended flashback to the Battle of Marathon, Themistocles is shown as the killer of Xerxes’ father Darius I (Igal Naor); Artemisia (Eva Green), a historical female commander in the Persian fleet, is given a vastly expanded role as the admiral of the whole navy and a wholly fictionalized background. Needless to say, because this is a “300” movie, Themistocles and Artemisia have an intense sexual encounter during a negotiation meeting. The fact that the Athenian general actually won through cunning rather than manly prowess—he pretended to defect to Xerxes—is not acknowledged. In brief, this film is a high school history teacher’s nightmare.
 Nevertheless, accuracy is not the goal of this movie. Heroic action and astonishing visual effects are the ends, and these ends are met with rare efficacy. Murro’s camerawork is significantly less cartoonish than that of his predecessor Zack Snyder; while one or two sequences, especially those giving the origin story of Xerxes in Persia, possess the laughably surreal, luminous quality of the original “300,” there is a remarkable restraint that underlies the cinematography. Murro’s use of 3D filming actually bests most of the medium’s other examples, especially the visual disaster that was the 3D version of Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby.” He seems to understand that the paradigm used in constructing the image for a 3D film is not photography but sculptural relief, and that, as a result, clean framing is key to the movie. 
 The primary weakness of the film is a temporal dissipation of action that reduces its power. While the first “300” maintained a moderately strict linear structure that ensured that the dramatic intensity of the film was focused on the Battle of Thermopylae and its disastrous climax, “300: Rise of an Empire” diminishes the tightness of the narrative with long flashbacks and the extension of the main action over three days and two settings.
 Overall, “300: Rise of an Empire” is the successor that one would expect for “300.” It will be interesting to see if and how the franchise continues, with the Persians crushed at the end of this film. The myth of ancient Greek unity that underlies the script of both films comes on hard times at the next major item in Greek military history, the Peloponnesian War. Regardless of the failings of the plot, a few things are certain: blood, sex, and amazing cinematography.

“Simple and Sure,” the first single from The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart’s upcoming third album, “Days of Abandon,” is a fun, poppy ride from the lead-in vocal notes to frontman Kip Berman’s singing and '80s-style guitar riffs. While “Simple and Sure” is not a complete departure from the musically-packed power ballads on their second album, “Belong,” it does simplify the band’s sound with sparser instrumentation that allows the guitar riff, the drum beat, and Berman’s voice to take center stage.
 
Berman seizes the spotlight gracefully as his melancholic voice initially resists but ultimately succumbs to the twee-pop, optimistic melody. “Simple and Sure” sounds like a reborn Smiths track where reticent romantic agony can be turned cathartic, even cautiously bright. The juxtaposition of dispirited lyrics with the upbeat guitar riff comes across as hopeful. Berman sings “I just wanna be loved / Simply wanna be loved” as the music builds around him, and the listener can hear excitement at the potential for this desire’s realization.
 
Some of the best moments of the track are those where the relatively simple but jangling, energetic instrumentals stand—or rather run—alone. The track represents a success for the band in scaling back their sound to isolate the core trio of keyboard, guitar, and drum set as well as Berman’s singing, allowing each element to thrive individually and together within the song.
 
“Days of Abandon” is out on April 22 via Yebo Music.

You probably don’t think much of Common these days. Maybe you don’t know who he is. Maybe the last time you heard him was the last time he penetrated the pop-culture zeitgeist—I’m referring, of course, to his decidedly forgettable verse on the last Jonas Brothers album. There’s also a chance you’re one of the few who watch him sling a six-gun on AMC’s “Hell on Wheels.”
 
But then again, maybe you’re like me. Maybe you remember when a Chicago MC named Lonnie Lynn burst onto the rap scene fully formed with both fire and intelligence, straight-talking but positive and flanked by the best producers in the game. Maybe you remember a little album called “Be” that rocked 2005. Back then, it seemed that Common was going nowhere but up, and “Be” was both a worthy step forward and an exciting signal of things to come. If we hadn’t been so focused on the future, though, then maybe we would have better recognized what was right in front of us. Maybe, just maybe, we wouldn’t have forgotten that “Be” was the best hip-hop album of its decade.
 
In our age of minimalist, industrial machine-rap, “Be” is sonically refreshing, a handful of ear candy dripping with honey-sweet soul. Perhaps because his usual producer J Dilla—then battling lupus—was spending less time in the studio, Common turned to a fellow Chicagoan for help, an up-and-comer by the name of Kanye West. This was a Yeezy whose only solo album was “The College Dropout,” who still based his sound on syrupy, chipmunk-speed samples. West crafted every track like he had something to prove, filling the album with lush strings and fat boom-bap beats. Only two tracks lack the Kanye touch, but the vinyl pops and simple old-school drums of the J Dilla-produced “Love Is...” and “It’s Your World” fit right in with the album’s soft sepia tone.


 
Handpicked Marvin Gaye samples aside, it’s clear Common was feeling a tad nostalgic when he sat down to pen the album’s lyrics. His fascination with the past is present from the outset, when he raps, “I wanna be as free as the spirits of those who left / I’m talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef” over the short but soulful “Be (Intro).” There’s even a song-length nostalgia trip here, the spartan “The Corner.” Over a beat steeped in urban grit, Common paints a picture of a poor Chicago street corner, bringing in spoken-word legends The Last Poets to reminisce on the old days: “The corner was our magic, our music, our politics.”
 
And yet, while it may be strongly tied to history, the album never loses its grip on the here and now. Indeed, there’s little sentimentality in the line, “I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie / Watch me as the cops be tryna pop and lock me.” Common uses the past to enhance a very real present, and Kanye falls right in step; on “Faithful,” a sped-up Faith Evans sample is slowly joined by—among others—Bilal and John Legend, riffing on the simple melody until uniting in glorious unison. The seamlessness, the blending of the present and the past, is a sign that the album is more than just a collection of soul samples—these are soul songs.
 
“Be” was the first hip-hop album I ever loved. It was refreshing to hear a rapper so thoughtful, so sensitive, even. I admittedly had little with which to compare—as a white kid basically rockin’ the suburbs for most of my young life, I heard the majority of my hip-hop in passing, on the radio or friends’ iPods. But when I heard Common so earnestly asking, “What if God was a her?” on “Faithful,” I knew I was hearing something far from the babes-and-drugs rap that I had narrowly defined as hip-hop.
 
The subject matter was often far from familiar—the album’s lead singles deal with sexual fantasies (“Go!”) and a backstabbing “queenpin” (“Testify”), and girls and drugs often do enter the conversation. But it was the way Common presents these stories and subjects that really got to me. In the midst of the scratch-filled street anthem “Chi-City,” he offers up a crafted commentary both clever and poignant, rapping, “Too many rape the culture / leave rappers with careers and their faith over.” Not limiting himself, though, to removed musings, he fills the song with stark, haunting imagery like the “black figure” standing “in the middle of chaos and gunfire.” The album is about being a caring person in a rough world, and there’s a bit of genius in the way Common’s sometimes-unfiltered rhymes consistently hold your trust.
 
Making music with a message seems a bit trite these days. It’s much more stylish to be apathetic and aloof, or at least to make your subject matter mysterious enough that anyone can identify. In the case of Common, though, it’s most likely that he just stopped caring. His next album, “Finding Forever,” shot its excellent production in the foot with sloppy “Finding Nemo” references, and he followed that misstep with an even bigger one, the awkward party album “Universal Mind Control.”
 
Every time I hear about something new from Common, I bristle with uneasy excitement. It’s been nine years since a truly indelible portrait of Chi-City life graced airwaves, nine long years since the last time Lonnie Lynn brought true sensitivity to the mic. I’ve held out in hope longer than most, but it’s seeping away ever so slowly, and with every lackluster verse that surfaces I lose hope faster. Still, I’ve got no hard feelings for the man; no goofy rhyme or Gap commercial appearance can diminish the glory of Common’s masterpiece. The album is sonically beautiful, decidedly uplifting, rooted in history but forward-looking. Hip-hop may have changed for good. Common may have moved on. “Be,” though, is eternal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It’s inevitable. The People’s Republic of China will overtake the United States as the world’s leading economy. This statement is no longer speculative. It is a fact.
China is now the world’s second largest economy. Americans are worried that China will control the financial and military affairs of the world, but the true indicator of authority in today’s age is soft power: how countries use persuasion, rather than coercion, to change behavior.
No developing nation ranks in the top ten countries in terms of soft power. It is determined through a combination of objective factors—such as number of Olympic medals and foreign students—and subjective ones—such as business brands and quality of life. A recent National Intelligence Council report found that China’s economy would surpass that of the United States before 2030. China has already begun to take over its competition in recent years. It has surpassed Europe’s largest economy, Germany, and has become Asia’s largest economy.
On the other hand, China also has an unsustainable growth model, which heavily depends on investment. It essentially takes the money out of the household sector and places into the hands of any investor with a bank account and means of establishing a small business. In this sense, China’s largest economic asset is not its labor force but its capital.
It has invested in foreign companies, infrastructure, and real estate all around the world, but it fails to show one thing that advanced economies do, despite their slower economic growth rates: originality. In other words, China’s economy is driven primarily by production rather than invention.
Innovation is yet another facet of soft power. Yes, iPhones, Xboxes, Kenmore dishwashers, and Gerber bottles are made in China. But they are not conceived there. These products are invented, patented, and sold by the U.S.
These products have an American nationality even though they were created in China. And American products like these continue to sway the world and its desires in favor of the U.S., even if China may benefit from them economically.
Yet, China does have the capacity to be more influential than the U.S. It is just that the circumstances surrounding China’s success are more economically driven than they are socially focused. In fact, looking back at history that is the case for practically any country that has seen success, whether it was Great Britain in the 19th century or the US in the 20th century.
These nations faced social issues while experiencing unprecedented economic growth. Therefore to  blame China for neglecting social issues while praising other countries for their social insight is not necessarily justified. Nevertheless China must not only focus on its economic power.
One of the biggest factors that plays into China’s increased economic productivity is that it has become the world’s largest exporter and second largest importer of goods and commodities. China has averaged a 10 percent economic growth rate over the past 30 years. It has also become the largest manufacturing economy of the world. Its unemployment rate is below seven percent, and the average Chinese citizen makes about $6,000 a year. China also leads the world in cotton and steel production, as it surpassed the U.S. it in 2010.
Yes, the list of recent Chinese accomplishments goes on and on whether it is a larger economy or higher academic achievement.
But how is it going to be better? Economic superiority does not necessarily mean complete dominance of world affairs. At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. was seen as the owner of the secret to the good life.
It was a life that everyone wanted—one more alluring than the one Communism could provide. The Soviet Union was economically successful but failed to provide a standard of living equivalent to that of America’s.
The U.S. will continue to be the world’s most influential country in the near future regardless of its slip in economic prowess and has been the country with the greatest soft power since the term was conceived 22 years ago (with the exception of 2012, in which Great Britain ranked number one).
The impact of American companies around the world is evident across the globe. People continue to drink Coca-Cola, eat at McDonald’s, and wear Levi’s. China may indeed one day have the greatest economic outpu, but it won’t have anything that matches the compelling stories of Hollywood, or the symphonious music of New York music labels, or even the global appeal of U.S. social media outlets such as Twitter and Instagram. It may never experience the level of free expression that is available in the U.S.
It’s possible in the future that China may exert power in the dominion of social dynamics. But for now and for many years to come, the U.S., through soft power, will hold the distinction as the world’s most influential country.

“I’m so excited for Housing Day.”
 
My blockmates and I were sitting around the common room of my suite in Thayer at seven in the morning. After the stresses of putting together our blocking group, we couldn’t wait to live together in one of Harvard’s 12 upperclassmen Houses the following year. As sounds of cheering reached our ears early that Thursday morning, we hurried to the window to see hordes of upperclassmen rush into the yard from all directions. 
 
As we waited, we remembered the past few months of conversations with upperclassmen about House life. We were impressed that these students felt passionate enough about their Houses to talk about them at length, to wear their gear, to play in intramurals, to spend hours on Housing Day videos, and to run outside during a freezing winter morning to welcome freshmen into their community.
 
“You just won the lottery.”
 
Looking back out the window, we saw that the various crowds of cheering upperclassmen had dispersed across the Yard to carry news of the housing lottery to eager freshmen. The sounds of knocking and yelling echoed up and down Thayer while my blockmates caught glimpses of each House’s cohort through the door’s peephole.
 
And then, the knock sounded on our door. I peeked through the eyehole one last time, and my shoulders slumped. When I told my roommates Cabot had come to call, one joked that we shouldn’t open the door, but ultimately we did. The Cabotians rushed into the suite flinging Swedish Fish across the room as we looked upon them with little expression. When the group departed, my blockmates and I were left with a sweets-covered floor and sour faces.
 
My blockmates and I soon parted ways to carry on with our days—classes and, in my case, midterms awaited. As I encountered my freshman peers we shared news of our fortunes. Responses to my announcement of Cabot ranged from the excited to the commiserative—I would be all right, I could transfer after a year, some told me. It was these sentiments that I found particularly hard to process. Between the upperclassmen conversations I had heard earlier in the year, and the looks upon the faces of my peers, my expectations for life in Cabot were low.
 
“It'll be okay.”
 
These past three years, I have certainly considered transferring to be closer to the square and friends—my mind has shuttled back and forth along Garden Street. However, I never submitted a transfer application. Instead, my Cabot experience has surpassed my sophomoric expectations—the housing, the community, and for the chance to learn from and love my House Masters. While I have come to form my own thoughts about my House, I continue to reflect upon the disparaging comments I heard freshman year and continue to hear today leveled against the Quad Houses and certain River Houses. Negative sentiment directed at any House is both unnecessary and harmful to student life at Harvard.
 
Critical comments  do not help cultivate excitement or House spirit. The negative culture of putting down allegedly inferior Houses disguises the fact that there are many students who are beyond happy living in Houses some of their peers deem less desirable. This only perpetuates the unfortunate myth that some Houses are categorically better than others. Students here should not hinder the ability of their peers to enjoy Harvard by diminishing Housing Day or the House experience that is integral to life at the College.
 
“Semper Cor.”
 
It’s important to remember that Harvard is in a period of positive transition. With the support of students, Harvard Transportation Services has expanded shuttle service, and we can all work together to make sure that the University keeps supporting student transportation needs. On the River, undergraduate life will also change with the large-scale House renewal project and the creation of the Smith Campus Center. Each of us can take part in making sure that these spaces look the way we want and that they bring together students no matter where they live.
 
In the meantime, I encourage upperclassmen to storm the Yard on Housing Day and build up the spirit for all Houses. Freshmen, enjoy this very special part of the year with your blockmates, and set high expectations for the House life to come.

  The British Empire: ruining gay sex for everybody since the sixteenth century. 
  So claims a humorous Queerty article published back in December, just after the Indian Supreme Court, in an affront to the rights of queer Indians, voted to re-criminalize “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”—code for any sexual activity besides heterosexual vaginal penetration.  
  It was a decision that took many local activists by surprise: the Delhi High Court had already struck down the statue in 2009, leading many to believe that the Supreme Court would easily follow suit. And the verdict prompted action: Indian queer activists and allies around the world fiercely protested the reinstituted statute. 
  The law in question: Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, passed originally in 1861 under Lord Macaulay, an agent of British colonialism in the subcontinent. 
  Fast forward to February 24. Just over two months after the Indian court’s decision, an even harsher bill was signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. Criminalizing not only gay sex but also “aiding and abetting homosexuality,” the legislation will impose strict punishment—up to life imprisonment—for those found guilty of “aggravated homsexuality.” Long-debated by the Ugandan parliament, the law has inspired an outcry from gay rights groups and foreign governments; some Western countries have already withdrawn aid. 
  Uganda’s anti-gay measure is a contemporary initiative--not the ratification of an 150-year-old prohibition. Nonetheless, Uganda, like India, is a former British colony, and it, too, inherited British anti-sodomy laws. And Uganda and India aren’t alone: the British enforced these rules in almost forty Commonwealth countries. In the majority of these places, they’re still on the books. 
  The history of colonial sexual regulation gives us insight into how “tradition” and “modernity” are configured in contemporary debates about gay rights across the globe. It also leads us to question Western notions about the rigid “traditionalism” of post-colonial societies—whose folkways, just like those of their former colonizers, are in flux and informed by cross-cultural contact. We also use these histories to challenge concepts of “traditional” culture invoked by those who situate homosexuality as a strictly Western phenomenon.  
  To state the obvious, we know that homosexuality is not an export of the modern West at all. Numerous scholars have written about the role of homoeroticism in a number of pre-colonial societies: in India alone textual examples range from the Kama Sutra to the traditional Urdu ghazal.  This is just as true in Western history: anyone who has studied the ancient Greeks or Boston marriages realizes that sexual diversity as much a part of human events as fire. 
  “Tradition” is a slippery talking point. It’s one evoked by both pro- and anti- gay agendas. And it’s often about a lot more than how people are having sex. 
  The Washington Post, for example, in an article tacitly condemning the Supreme Court ruling, characterizes India as a “still-traditional” society—implying that this “traditionalism” is at least partly to blame for the setback to gay rights. In a similar vein, yet with an opposite ideological slant, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, spokesperson of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), conjures tradition in support of Section 377: “We can’t bring Western culture into our society and culture,” he says. 
  In Uganda, similar rhetoric is at play. President Museveni has been particularly strong in articulating his approval of the law as more than just a statement against the desirability of homosexuality: rather, he argues, it’s a statement of self-determination. "Outsiders cannot dictate to us,” Museveni said in a speech, referring to the protests of foreign governments and NGOs. “This is our country. I advise friends from the West not to make this an issue, because if they make it an issue the more they will lose.”  
  These discourses of traditionalism force the debate into an impossible binary, as Indian and Ugandan politicians claim the anti-colonial mantle and their Western counterparts invoke the rhetoric of human rights. Yet a historicized view allows us to see beyond these false narratives: Western powers are not universal champions of individual rights and self-determination, as colonial sodomy laws (and, indeed, the entire colonial project) tell us. And post-colonial nations are not necessarily “traditionally” opposed to gay rights: an examination of the complex history of sexuality discounts this as well. 
In this tussle over the meaning of tradition, it’s not local politicians or, as Museveni claims, Western aid groups who risk the biggest losses: it’s local queer populations, mobilized in these debates not as humans, but as symbols.

When the College Board announced last week that it would restructure the SAT, much praise came as a result of its new efforts to appeal to low-income students—a demographic that, many claim, are put at a disadvantage when taking the test. Harvard’s own Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 commended the College Board for deciding to make such changes. While we applaud the company for its intentions, we remain dissatisfied with the test itself. While the College Board is taking a step in the right direction by attempting to cater to students from lower-income brackets, its methods in measuring preparedness for college still lack effectiveness.
 
Among many other changes, come spring 2016 the new SAT will consist of only two mandatory sections and will be graded on a 1600-point scale, just as it was before 2005. There will be no penalty for wrong answers, and the vocabulary section will likely include fewer obscure words. Perhaps most notably (and laudably), the College Board will offer free tutorials online to all students that plan on taking the test, as well as organize for free college applications for students that are less privileged. The two latter policies are laudable changes, but this doesn’t mean the test is free from scrutiny.
 
 
We favor using standardized tests in college admissions: When properly conducted, they provide academic institutions with valuable and easily calculated information about members of a large pool of applicants. In order for these scores to be truly reflective of the applicant, however, standardized testing should accurately measure one’s inherent intellect and preparedness for college. In other words, a test should gauge one’s logic and ability to solve problems—not how much an individual has trained to answer easily-predictable questions. In making its questions more predictable, the SAT encourages cramming, not learning—which is standardized testing at its worst. Unfortunately, it seems that the SAT will still measure SAT-preparedness, rather than college preparedness.
 
 
Though the College Board will offer free online tutorials to all students, this still doesn’t stop higher-income families from obtaining expensive, private tutors and supplementary books in order to better prepare their children by teaching them SAT-specific strategies.
 
We have faith that standardized testing can be done right, and should indeed be a valuable component of college applications. We also appreciate the College Board’s decision to provide free support to students. Ultimately, however, the changes proposed do not seem sweeping enough to correct the test’s apparent bias toward higher-income families.

Students have expressed concerns about the University’s decision to select former Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg―who is a 1966 alumnus of the Business School―as the 2014 commencement speaker.
Concerns center around Bloomberg’s support of stop-and-frisk, a New York City police policy which allows officers to stop, question, and search pedestrians for illegal materials at random.
According to a report published by the New York Civil Liberties Union, young black and Latino males―though they comprise only 4.7 percent of the city’s population―accounted for 41.6 percent of stops under this policy in 2011. The report also states that the number of stops that involved young black men exceeded the entire population of young black men throughout the city.
“Bloomberg’s policies have deeply affected minority groups in a discriminatory way,” Gabriel H. Bayard ’15 said. “If he’s speaking at the [Institute of Politics] that’s one thing, but for him to speak at Commencement and receive an honorary degree from Harvard is another.”
The University press release announcing the speaker selection did not state that Bloomberg would receive an honorary degree, but previous Commencement speakers such as Oprah Winfrey and Fareed R. Zakaria have received honorary degrees.
Harvard College Black Men’s Forum President Rodriguez S. Roberts ’15 also raised questions about the selection of the former mayor.
“Harvard’s bringing him to deliver the commencement address could be taken as either an endorsement of this policy or as simple ignorance thereof,” Roberts wrote in an email. “To be honest, I’m not quite sure which is worse,” he said.
Race came to the forefront of student discussion last week as students launched a campaign entitled I, Too, Am Harvard, which highlighted what some described as insensitivity to racial issues at Harvard.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal responded to complaints in a statement to Buzzfeed.
“We applaud organizers and participants of the “I, too, am Harvard” campaign for working to make their voices heard,” Neal said. “This is an important conversation for all Harvard students, and for college students across the nation. All our students belong at Harvard.”
Yet some students who participated in the campaign felt that selecting Bloomberg only exacerbated concerns that Harvard has not focused enough on race relations on campus.
Selecting Bloomberg “makes the administration's recent statement about valuing the presence and concern of students of color here on campus even less genuine,” said Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who was featured in the photo campaign.
Other students expressed concerns about Bloomberg’s implementation of policies targeted at the Muslim community of New York during his tenure as mayor. Under the Bloomberg administration, the New York Police Department monitored Muslim student organizations at 16 universities both within and outside of New York as part of a counterterrorism effort.
“[Bloomberg] has a bad record with the NYPD and minorities,” Harvard Islamic Society member Zarmeena Dawood ’15 said.
Islamic Society member Shehryar R. Sheikh ’15 voiced similar concerns. Sheikh said that, as a Muslim, he was disturbed by Bloomberg’s selection because of his perception of the former mayor’s treatment of Muslims in New York City.
Sheikh also noted that his roommate plans to wear a “Don’t frisk me, bro” T-shirt to commencement.
Bloomberg delivered commencement addresses at Stanford University in 2013 and the University of North Carolina in 2012.

University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email to Divest Harvard that she was disappointed in the way that the group, which calls for Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuel companies, presented a recent comment she made regarding the oil industry’s influence.
“After all of our frank discussions on this topic over the past couple of years, I had hoped you would carry on your campaign with a greater degree of civility and fairness,” Faust wrote in the email, after agreeing with the group that it is important for society to address climate change.
Last month, Alli J. Welton '15, the Student Outreach Co-Chair of Divest Harvard, approached Faust while on a walk in Harvard Yard to confront her about the University’s stance on fossil fuel divestment.
During the encounter, which was videotaped and posted on Vimeo, Welton asked who would take on the issue of climate change if Harvard would not, to which Faust responded that Harvard aids in the transition to renewable resources through academic discoveries.
In a moment that has since garnered attention beyond Harvard’s campus, Welton claimed that the fossil fuel industry prevents the implementation of these discoveries, after which Faust said, “That is not the case.” At this point, the version of the Divest Harvard video online at the time of Faust’s email ended.
"When I said 'that is not the case’ I was addressing the assertion that fossil fuel companies were somehow disrupting Harvard’s ability to implement programs of research into climate change and renewable energy,” Faust wrote in the email. “That is, as I said, not the case.”
Faust’s email reiterated the major themes of her letter that she wrote to the Harvard community in October 2013 on fossil fuel divestment. Specifically, her praise for the students’ passion for raising awareness of climate change, Harvard’s role as an academic institution in carrying out educational and research programs, and a “strong institutional commitment to sustainability” through recent initiatives appear in both the October letter and Monday’s email.
Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, Divest Harvard’s Co-Coordinator, said that the student organization will be posting the entire video of the encounter, along with Faust’s email, on its website.
In addition, Divest Harvard released a written statement responding to Faust’s email.
"The full video [of our conversation] with President Faust speaks for itself,” the statement read. “If President Faust wishes to clarify her statement, we invite her to join us in a public forum—which we have been requesting for months—to discuss her views on how the fossil fuel industry influences politics."
Maxmin said that Divest Harvard will hold a set of “teach-ins,” featuring a statement from climatologist Michael E. Mann, about the fossil fuel industry's influence outside of Faust's office in Massachusetts Hall Tuesday beginning at noon.
“We have invited President Faust, and we’ll have a chair waiting for her,” Maxmin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following debate sparked by the release of its Housing Day videos—one of which featured masked female students dancing in bikinis—Kirkland House held an open forum Monday night to discuss student opinions.
Though the event was advertised over email as an “open discussion” to foster community discourse, a Kirkland House tutor told Crimson reporters that Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley said that reporters were not allowed into the event.
The conversation was led by Kirkland tutors and Harvard College Women’s Center interns, according to emails sent out over Kirkland House’s email list, as well as that of the Women’s Center.
“I think this is an issue that Kirkland has wanted to work through because it affected them,” Conley said, adding that the situation has become distorted by “highly public media.”
Conley praised the discussion as “stunningly productive” and “500 percent beyond [his] expectations.”
He added that the students conducted themselves with “uncommon poise and civility, and also empathy—a great deal of empathy, even among people who were in disagreement with one another.”
“It was very nice that there was a forum put on, and hopefully there will be more productive discussion going forward,” Kirkland resident Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 said after the event.
Following the forum, Conley said that he barred reporters from attending the event because the discussion was originally intended exclusively for members of the Kirkland House community. However, it appeared that residents of other Houses attended the discussion, which Conley confirmed.
In addition to prompting the formal dialogue, the video that prompted the removal, called “Dark Boar” set to the music of Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse,” has led students to reflect on the role of Housing Day on campus. Some students said they felt that the video controversy highlights potential shortcomings in the way Houses approach Housing Day.
“I can’t tell you whether or not a majority of students were in support or against these videos and against that Stein Club [where the videos were debuted],” Kirkland resident Edward Escalon ’14 said in an interview on Sunday.
“But what I can tell you is that I do feel that there is a certain amount of silencing happening in the sense that I think that students that maybe were upset about some of these things may have been hesitant to come forward. They may have been hesitant to share their dissatisfaction, because no one wants to ruin Housing Day,” he said.
Escalon added, “No one wants to be the face of someone that ruined House community, and I just think that has a silencing impact on people.”
Kirkland resident Ian D. Nightingale ’15 said in an interview on Sunday that he takes issue with the need to have one “official” Housing Day video. Nightingale, who made a parody House video with friends, said that the video controversy points to a larger problem with Housing Day videos and the expression of House spirit.
“We should decentralize the Housing Day video process, and instead of an official video, we should just have a general spirit of these videos being passed around on Facebook and stuff,” Nightingale said. “Since everyone is sharing them on Facebook anyways, it makes more sense to do that as we see fit and not stress about what’s representing the House well or not.”
Kirkland resident Kevin Garcia ’14, who took “full responsibility” for the development of “Dark Boar” over the House’s listserv on Friday, reuploaded eight of the videos—excluding “Dark Boar”—to his personal Youtube account late Monday. The title of each video included the phrase “Not Official, Not Representative.” Garcia declined to comment on the videos.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 9, 2013—one year ago Sunday—members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences learned for the first time that top administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of 17 resident deans in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
In the days and weeks following the announcement, faculty members loudly voiced concerns over faculty governance and consultation, as well as a loss of trust in administrators that they said had violated their privacy policy and reasonable expectations.


But one year later, professors say those concerns have faded within the minds of members of the University’s flagship faculty. Along with the passage of time, they point to some combination of three key actions—an external report on actions surrounding the searches, a draft of a new electronic communications policy, and the resignation of one of the deans responsible for the searches—as having mellowed faculty concern.
“As far I can tell…it’s not something that is particularly on the mind, at the moment, of faculty,” Mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid said. “This has somewhat faded. I think in other ways, too, there have been some attempts by the administration to soften things in various ways.”
 
Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall attributed the retreat of interest to the faculty’s tendency toward a “short attention span” as well as a growth in understanding of the events that transpired surrounding the email search.
 
Twenty faculty members, many of whom vocally voiced concerns last spring in letters, interviews, and Faculty meetings, declined or did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.
 
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith also declined to comment on the aftermath of the searches or the state of his relationship with the Faculty he oversees for this story. Smith has refused to meet for regularly scheduled interviews with The Crimson or discuss the searches and their aftermath since May 2013, the last time he discussed the searches with reporters.
 
Smith, along with then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, took responsibility for the initial searches, which were executed in Sept. 2012 in an effort to identify who had shared internal Administrative Board documents related to the Gov. 1310 case. On April 2, relations between administrators and faculty members deteriorated further when Hammonds told professors at their monthly meeting that she had acted without Smith’s approval to authorize a second, more invasive round of queries.
At their next meeting in May, the last of the year, faculty members spent nearly two hours lodging complaints with administrators over issues of governance, loss of trust, and communication.
Later that month, The Crimson reported that Hammonds would resign at the academic year’s end. In a statement after her resignation became official, Hammonds maintained that the email search scandal “was difficult but it was not a motivating factor in my decision to step down.”
In a report released in July, Boston attorney Michael B. Keating corroborated the administration’s claim that those involved had been unaware that they were breaching privacy protocol at the time the searches took place.
 
The 29-page Keating report helped to clear up uncertainty from which the the faculty’s initial frustration arose, Hall said. Such uncertainty lent itself to the vision of a “worst-case scenario,” he added. “[That] dissipated quickly once people realized what had actually transpired.”
 
In addition to commissioning Keating at the April faculty meeting, University President Drew G. Faust announced the creation of a committee tasked with reviewing the patchwork of email privacy policies in place  across the University at the time of the searches with the end goal of recommending a universal policy.
 
The committee handed down their proposal for a single, University-wide privacy policy late last month, after almost a year of consideration. If approved, it would establish a faculty oversight committee, regular record-keeping, and a clear chain of command for authorizing access to electronic communications.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor and the former dean of the College, wrote in an email that the “recommendations seem to get all the major points right—and if these policies are adopted, that will be a big and reassuring change in the standards.”
This March’s Faculty meeting, which would have been the first chance for faculty members to discuss the proposed policy in a formal setting with administrators, was cancelled last week due to “insufficient business ready for action.” The cancellation leaves unanswered the question as to where the faculty’s collective voice lies a year after the email searches were announced.
“Biding time is the general attitude,” History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, a former Crimson Editorial chair said, adding that faculty are not as “excited” about the issue at the present.
 
“We’ll see when this [email privacy] report gets debated,” he said.
Hall said that faculty members’ quiet reaction to the cancellation of last week’s meeting offers a sharp contrast with the climate last spring, when such a cancellation “would have been a bad move.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 11, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of resident deans whose email accounts were searched by administrators in connection with the Government 1310 cheating case. In fact, the accounts of 17 resident deans were subject to the secret queries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: March 11, 2014, at 4:15 p.m.
Following years of renovation, the Harvard Art Museums announced Tuesday afternoon that its new facility, which will house collections from all three of the University’s art museums—the Busch-Reisinger, the Fogg, and the Arthur M. Sackler—will open on Nov. 16 of this year. The reconstructed building, which expands total gallery space to 43,000 square feet, will include six levels of public space, a new glass roof, and new resources and spaces for teaching, exhibition, and research. 
“We knew that we had an opportunity to redefine the Harvard Art Museums as an accessible and connected 21st-century facility for teaching and learning, so we engaged [architect] Renzo Piano to design a building to implement that vision,” Director of the Harvard University Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz said in the press release. “We asked him to design it from the inside out—to create a new kind of laboratory for the fine arts that would support our mission of teaching across disciplines, conducting research, and training museum professionals.”
The creation of the new facility, which is located at 32 Quincy St., marks the first time that the collections will be displayed under one roof, though only a small percentage of the entire collections, which consists in total of about 250,000 objects, will be on display at any one time.
Extensive reconstruction of the Fogg Art Museum—the most expansive of Harvard’s art collections—began in early 2008, launching a renovation process that was first called for in a 1956 report. Several unexpected obstacles, including the complexity of preserving portions of the 1927 building and the presence of asbestos, stalled the opening of the central facility past its original opening goal of late 2013. During the reconstruction period, the Sackler has remained open and featured highlights from the University’s art collection.
The art museums have raised $237 million to date, according to the press release. The initial goal for the project was $250 million.
While the revitalization and reconstruction process retained the building’s historic street-facing facades and extended its interior Calderwood Courtyard, most of the inside spaces were completely overhauled in a redesign that will increase gallery space by more than 40 percent and update the facility to align with the University’s sustainability initiatives. The construction also includes the creation of an additional space along Prescott Street.
The major exterior work ended last year when the builders reached substantial completion on Nov. 15, 2013, said Peter Atkinson, the director of facilities planning and management for the Art Museums, in an interview Friday. At that point, builders were given a certificate of occupancy and staff could begin moving into the building.
Since then, the building has undergone a process called commissioning, in which all new internal systems, such as electrical systems, security technologies, and elevators, are tested. This process will continue in the upcoming months to insure that the Museum is ready for opening in November.
“It is a very smart building because of the assets we have in here that we are stewards in protecting,” said Atkinson.
The new facilities will contain a 300-seat lecture hall, seminar rooms, and a lab devoted to the study of art media materials. The Art Study Center, a major feature of building located on the fourth floor, includes spaces in which students, faculty, and others will be able to request objects for individual study from the collection that are not on display. The Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, a conservation, research, and training facility, will be located on the fifth floor of the new building.
“Renzo Piano has designed a building that is as beautiful as the works of art it will house and as thoughtful as the people who will work and learn within it,” University President Drew G. Faust said in the press release. “It will expand the ways in which we use art and art-making as part of the curriculum, and it will invite our neighbors and visitors to enjoy some of the University’s unparalleled treasures.”
Before the opening in November, the Art Museums will host events to celebrate the launch, beginning with an event dedicated to students, with events for donors, alumni, and other groups, as well as a special preview for Cambridge residents, to follow.

The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning will more than double the size of its staff and open a number of satellite offices across the Harvard campus, including one in Allston, with funds raised in the Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences, the center’s faculty director, Robert A. Lue, said Tuesday afternoon.
 
The center currently has a staff of 14, counting Lue and the center’s executive director, Terry Aladjem, according to its website. Headquartered in the Science Center, the Bok Center already has one satellite office at 125 Mount Auburn Street, where it shares a space with edX.
 
“The Bok Center does need to grow,” said Lue, who is also a professor of biology. “We’re stretched very thin.”
 
According to Lue, demand for the center’s services has grown in recent years. Increasingly, professors and teaching fellows seek out help to improve their own teaching, as well as assistance with course development.
 
“Teaching is evolving,” said Diane Andronica, technical supervisor at the Bok Center. “That's going to pose some challenges that we’re going to have to figure out how to face, and more personnel would certainly not hurt.”
 
Lue said that with funds from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences capital campaign, the center will both expand its current operations and begin new projects. At the moment, the Bok Center works to promote better teaching by providing training and professional development resources to Harvard teaching staff, including teaching fellows, as well as junior and senior faculty members. From teaching evaluations for instructors to research on pedagogy, the center sponsors more than a dozen programs.
 
“If you’re going to be a sandbox...for teaching, you need experimental spaces,” Lue said of the center’s hands on approach to testing different methods for the classroom.
 
The expansion will include the addition of several “nodes” across the University, including one at the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston, Lue said.
 
When administrators announced in Feb. 2013 that large portions of SEAS would move to Allston, they said that construction would begin this year.
 
Andronica said the expansion plans made sense given the trajectory of the center.
 
“We can definitely use more space, especially if we're going to do more work and expanding to more departments and schools,” she said. Particularly, Andronica cited the difficulties associated with transporting equipment across the Charles River as another reason to open a node in Allston.
 
FAS aims to raise $150 million to fund “Leading in Learning,” one of its six key campaign priorities. The funds raised for “Leading in Learning” will be split among the Bok Center, HarvardX, and the SEAS Learning Incubator, according to promotional literature for the $2.5 billion campaign.
 
For the Bok Center specifically, the campaign aims to provide support for media literacy and visualization, speaking and student engagement, and the art and science of learning, according to the promotional literature.
 
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith declined to comment on the Bok Center’s expansion. The dean has refused to meet with The Crimson for regular on-the-record interviews since May 2013, several months before FAS made its capital campaign public.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a batch of thesis deadlines rapidly approaches in the days before spring break, seniors who have spent the past year or more researching, writing, and revising expressed relief that they were close to finishing what is often a student’s most massive academic undertaking and said they look forward to enjoying their last few months at the College.
While some concentrations such as Social Studies and History and Literature require students to write a thesis in order to complete their degrees, other departments like English and Economics do not mandate that students write a thesis but ask that students who seek highest honors at the College complete one.
Theses range from economic analyses to dramatic performances to scientific experiments, and for some students, the process of constructing and completing their thesis can begin early in their college careers as they seek out advisors, begin field research, and apply for grants.
While the students interviewed for this article said they viewed their theses as a fundamental and formative part of their Harvard experience, most said they were excited to finally submit their work.
 
Matthew S. Ackerman ’14, whose economics thesis is due Thursday, said after he submits his paper it will be “weird to be normal again.”
 
“[I’ve] gone out only a couple of times this semester,” Ackerman said, adding that he has stayed up until 3 a.m. most nights for the past six weeks to finish his thesis. “I ask myself, is it fun enough to warrant me not working tonight? And usually that answer is a depressing no.”
 
Rebecca E. Handlin ’14, who submitted her creative English thesis on March 3, said she had planned her daily schedule around writing her thesis, which was composed of five original short stories.
 
“I live in the quad, so I would wake up and write, and I would stay in the quad and revise,” Handlin said. “I would need to choose between staying in the quad all day or going to the river all day.”
 
Handlin said she is still adjusting to having free time now that she has submitted her thesis.
“When you aren't working on the thesis, you are wondering, ‘Why am I not working on my thesis?’” she said.
There is no College-wide data about the number of thesis writers, but, as an example, according to Economics Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron, approximately 40 students are writing a thesis in his department, which amounts to about 20 percent of concentrators.
“I would say the majority of students actually don’t write a thesis,” Ackerman said. In fact, Ackerman originally had not planned to write a thesis, but after researching a charter school study in a graduate economics course last semester, he decided to continue researching and petitioned to enter the thesis process late.
Although many thesis writers, like those concentrating in Government, History and Literature, or English, have already submitted their theses, many seniors will be writing over spring break.
Jason C. Huo ’14, an Engineering Sciences concentrator who will be finishing his thesis in early April, said he is envious of friends who are finishing their theses this week. Still, Huo said, he anticipates that his final months at the College will be a relaxing time of reflection.
“It’s sort of time to look back and think, ‘Wow we’ve been here for four years,’” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Students and members of Divest Harvard gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall Tuesday afternoon for a series of “teach-ins” conducted to reveal ways in which they believe the fossil fuel industry creates climate denialism and interferes with clean energy initiatives.
 
The “teach-ins” were organized by Divest Harvard as a response to President Drew G. Faust’s statement in the organization’s recently published video in which the group’s Student Outreach Co-Chair Alli J. Welton ’15 challenged the University’s stance on divestment. Massachusetts Hall is the home of the University’s central administration and contains Faust’s office.
 
On Monday, Faust issued an email response to the group, saying that she was disappointed by the way the group handled the video confrontation and reiterating the University’s commitment to sustainability initiatives apart from divestment.
 
Divest Harvard Faculty Coordinator Benjamin Franta, a graduate student who worked with Welton to organize the sit-ins, said that he believed Faust denied the political power of the fossil fuel industry in the video. He said he found this surprising because the influence of the fossil fuel industry in blocking clean energy initiatives is “well-documented.”
 
“There has been some dispute on what she actually meant,” Franta said in reference to Faust’s email response. However, he added that based on the video alone, “There’s a clear interpretation of what she meant.”
 
Franta said that the group would like Faust to “clear this up and actually talk about this important issue.”
 
The event consisted of three “teach-ins” that covered topics including fossil fuel companies’ expansive carbon reserves, the influence of these companies in financing political campaigns, and statistics of the University’s carbon usage. According to Welton, over the course of the afternoon, over 60 people stopped to listen to the group speak.
 
Welton and Franta said that fossil fuel companies use lobbying and the legal system to block clean energy measures, arguing that the fossil fuel industry actively fights clean energy rather than simply promoting its own interests.
 
During the event, Welton and Franta also read statements from leading climate experts and University faculty, including Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael E. Mann, SEAS Professor of Applied Physics David Keith, and Professor of Biological Oceanography James J. McCarthy.
 
“The intention [of the “teach-ins”] was to provide some time to learn the truth about what fossil fuel companies are doing,” Welton said after the event.
 
The event followed several attempts by Divest Harvard to confront the University on the topic of divestment. According to Franta, “The [Harvard] Corporation is not interested in meeting anymore, and so we don’t have a way to engage with them anymore.” The Corporation is the University’s highest governing body.
 
Welton said that it is time for President Faust to engage with students and the community in a public forum.
 
“Otherwise we’re going to keep doing what we can to bring together enough sources from our students and faculty and alumni that the administration can’t afford to ignore us anymore,” she said.
 
Faust did not attend the event.

Four months after Harvard announced planned renovations to The Richard A. & Susan F. Smith Campus Center, and almost a week after faculty and student working groups released their recommendations, the future of retailers and restaurants inside the Smith Center is still unclear.
 
Formerly called the Holyoke Center, the central building which houses University Health Services and several ground-floor businesses was renamed in November after a donation from Richard A. Smith '46 and Susan F. Smith. The bottom three floors are set to undergo renovations beginning in 2016, and construction is estimated to be completed by 2018.
 
Plans for the new campus center are currently underway. The University announced that London-based Hopkins Architects will design the new building with a budget of about $80 million, according to an article in Harvard Magazine. Student and administrator working groups have also met to discuss possible ideas for the center, including food options and student meeting spaces.
 
Still, current tenants of the Smith Center, such as Al’s Harvard Square Café and Au Bon Pain, are uncertain about how the renovations will affect their businesses.
 
According to Au Bon Pain General Manager Anup Upaghyaya, the cafe has yet to be contacted regarding the potential impact that renovations could have on their establishment.  However, he expressed a desire to continue doing business in Harvard Square.
 
“We want to stay open,” Upaghyaya said.
 
Barry F. Penn, a partner at Al’s Harvard Square Cafe, echoed the sentiment, stating that although he is unaware of any specific timetable, he is hopeful that the University will include Al’s in the plans.
 
“We assume that they’re gonna contact us and Oggi’s, and tell us what’s in store, or maybe ask us for input,” Penn said. “I really don't know what the plans are or what our participation is.”
 
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who co-chaired the working group for College administrators with Leverett House Co-Master Howard M. Georgi ’68, said that the committee did not focus on how these businesses would factor into their plans for the Smith Center.
 
“We actually did not make any recommendations regarding ground floor business that I recall,” Dingman said.
 
However, Dingman voiced concern about adding a Harvard University Dining Services location to the Smith Center.
 
“There was some concern in our committee that if HUDS is struggling to make ends meet now, that if they add another operation using the same income base from students, that this could be a diminution in the offerings in the houses,” Dingman said.
 
For Courtnee A. Benford, a student at the Graduate School of Education, having a HUDS option in the Smith Center is not a priority.
 
“I like the local businesses, and that it’s not just a straight-up Harvard cafeteria,” Benford said.
 
Wynne M. Graham ’17 said that the most important thing to her is keeping food options available.
 
“I don’t have a huge preference,” Graham said. “It’s definitely nice to have some food places here next to the Yard.”

Harvard scientists have made a breakthrough in studying early onset Alzheimer’s Disease by converting patients’ skin cells into neurons in the hopes of facilitating a better understanding of the disease and creation of drug therapies.
 
The study, led by Tracy Young-Pearse, a Harvard Stem Cell Institute affiliate and member of Brigham and Women’s hospital, concluded what had previously only been observed in mice—that the early onset of Alzheimer’s is directly correlated to higher levels of amyloid beta protein 42.  Most people generally produce amyloid beta with only 40 amino acids, but in early onset of the disease, amyloid beta protein 42, which has two extra amino acids, was more prevalent.
 
As a form of progressive dementia that affects more than 26 million people worldwide, early onset AD usually brings about cognitive decline and memory loss in individuals in their 30’s to 50’s while the more common late onset AD tends to affect individuals in their 70’s, 80’s and 90’s.
 
Researchers also concluded that the neurons had higher amounts of tau protein, a classic signal of Alzheimer’s presence.
 
The recent findings could lead to the development of potential therapies for this common disease.
 
“The ability to direct stem cells generated from patients to become brain cells allows us with an unprecedented opportunity to study, on a large scale, living patient-derived brain cells in a dish,” Young-Pearse said. “Not only can we use these to better understand the mechanisms underlying the disease, but we also can use these to test novel therapeutic strategies in the cell types involved in the disease.”
 
Moreover, this research serves as a proof-of-concept that stem cells can be used to model diseases and discover therapies.
 
“The field is highly collaborative, working together to…[make] different types of neurons that are affected in various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease,” Young-Pearse said.

Researchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT have discovered several gene mutations that potentially protect against type 2 diabetes, according to a journal article published in Nature Genetics earlier this month. 
 
The study identified individuals from Finland and Sweden who, despite their high risk for diabetes, never contracted the disease. Scientists isolated the mutations in the SLC308A gene in the hopes of identifying drug targets that could lower patient risk.
 
The scientists found that carriers of the gene mutation have a 65 percent reduced risk of contracting the diseases, suggesting protectionist qualities.
 
"Our study identified several mutations in a gene… each of which inactivates the protein that it makes," said Jason A. Flannik, lead researcher and fellow in genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 
Flannik also suggested that the inactivity of this protein could be mimicked through drugs which inactivate its growth. If developed, these therapies could provide the general population with the benefits of the mutation.
 
"Because these people walking around with only one copy of SLC30A8 are protected against type 2 diabetes… it suggests that if you designed a drug to inhibit or reduce activity of SLC30A8, it might prevent or treat type 2 diabetes," Flannik wrote in an email.
 
The Broad Institute's press release on the study agreed, saying, "The results were seen in patients from multiple ethnic groups, suggesting that a drug that mimics that effect of these mutations might have broad utility around the globe."
 
Currently, few preventative therapies are available on the market for public consumption.
 
According to the National Institute of Health, "a number of therapies are approved for type 2 diabetes, [but] none can reverse disease progression over the long term or prevent complications of the disease." 
 
Drug therapies preventing type 2 diabetes would greatly impact the 79 million high-risk, pre-diabetes adults living in the United States. It is unclear whether the hypothesized drug therapy would help the 382 million people already suffering from the disease worldwide.
 
Flannik warns that determining the viability of creating new drug therapies "will require years, maybe decades of research.”
 
Multiple universities, hospitals, as well as a pharmaceutical company, Pfizer Inc., collaborated with the Broad Institute in this study.

Three months after the globally televised memorial for Nelson Mandela, the Harvard University Committee on African Studies commemorated the South African leader’s legacy at Sanders Theatre on Tuesday evening.
Titled “Meanings of Mandela,” the event featured speeches, readings from Mandela’s speeches, and a panel discussion on the Mandela’s life. Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Jonathan L. Walton opened with a prayer, while University President Drew G. Faust introduced the prominent speakers of the night.
Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, introduced Wole Soyinka, Nobel laureate and fellow at the Hutchins Center.
Like Mandela, Soyinka is remembered for time spent in jail, where Gates said Soyinka developed into “a thinker and writer.” Soyinka honored Mandela for his nonviolent political resistance through a reading of Soyinka's piece, “The Dance Is Not Over.”
“Mandela was a warrior leader but he was averse to ‘bleedership,’” Soyinka said. “He proved it in South Africa.”
Professor Lawrence D. Bobo, W. E. B. DuBois professor of the social sciences and chair of the department of African and African American Studies, recited a passage from Mandela’s autobiography, “Long Walk to Freedom.” Maria L. Makhabane, a student at Harvard Business School, proceeded to read an excerpt from Mandela’s Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech from 1993.
The event also featured a panel, including former chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Margaret H. Marshall, who is a native South Africa, ViceChancellor and Principal of the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa Adam Habib, and Achille Mbembe, research professor in History and Politics at the University of Witwatersrand.
“I hope to, first, commemorate this man, and second, lay the foundation of the idea that you can’t have a democracy without rule of law,” Marshall said.
The panelists agreed that there will never be a peacemaker as great as Mandela.
“If the 20th century was the struggle of equality, the 21st century will be the struggle against inequality and transcending it,” Habib said.
The event concluded with the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College performing the South African national anthem.

Harvard has raised $900 million since the public launch of its capital campaign last September, boosting the fundraising drive’s ongoing total to $3.7 billion, more than half of its goal, University President Drew G. Faust said on Tuesday.
 
The $900 million raised in just six months exceeds the total amount collected during the last complete fiscal year, when the University raised a record $792 million. When the University publicly launched The Harvard Campaign, it announced it had already raised $2.8 billion in a multiyear quiet phase.
 
“I’m thrilled. This shows tremendous momentum,” Faust said in an interview in her Massachusetts Hall office Tuesday afternoon. She cautioned, though, that people should not expect the campaign to continue to progress so rapidly.
 
“I think we should all keep in mind that campaigns tend to have slow times, fast times, and I think the launch was something people had waited for,” she said. “We hadn’t been in a campaign for many years, so I think we got a lot of momentum at the start.”
 
Since the campaign launched, the University has received a series of high-profile gifts, including $10 million given to the Graduate School of Design by John K. F. Irving  ’83 and Anne I. Oxley in December; $90 million to the Medical School by Ludwig Cancer Research and $10 million to the Law School from Sumner M. Redstone ’44 in January; and the largest gift in Harvard College history, Kenneth L. Griffin ’89’s $150 million to support financial aid, a professorship at the Business School, and other unspecified campaign goals.
 
Together, these large gifts total $260 million, more than a quarter of the fundraising garnered since the Harvard Campaign launch. The University has not specified where the majority of the remaining $640 million comes from.
 
"While we're in the early stages of the Campaign, we continue to enjoy the philanthropic and volunteer support of alumni and friends around the world,” Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers '74 said in a statement. “All campaigns have inevitable peaks and valleys, but we are feeling very positive about the reaction to date."
 
Harvard’s capital campaign priorities include innovations in teaching and learning, advancing a more globally viable Harvard, campus development, and attracting talent through a combination of student financial aid and faculty support.
 
“The big idea in this campaign is that higher education is changing rapidly, and we want to use the campaign to propel Harvard into the opportunities of the twenty-first century,” Faust said. “It’s a series of ideas that really embody the notion of ‘how do we lead change? How do we sustain Harvard’s commitment in leadership in a very changed environment?”
 
The University’s last fundraising drive was led by President Neil L. Rudenstine, who raised $2.6 billion between 1994 to 1999. Like many higher education fund drives, especially those at elite institutions, Rudenstine exceeded his original goal, which was $2.1 billion.
 
Similarly, Stanford far exceeded its original goal of $4.3 billion and raised the largest amount ever by an institution of higher learning during a single capital campaign. “The Stanford Challenge” concluded with a total sum of $6.23 billion at the end of 2011.
 
Of Harvard’s $6.5 billion goal, Faust said, “It was an appropriate goal to set, and we’ll see how we do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the legalization of medical marijuana in Massachusetts at the beginning of 2014, Harvard will not be altering its drug prohibition policies on campus to make an exception for medical marijuana.
“In light of the continued federal restrictions and the potential consequences to students who violate them, no proposal is being considered at this time to alter Harvard’s policy related to medical marijuana,” Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira wrote in an email.
In Nov. 2012, Barreira said that UHS will not make any changes to its policies until the details of the state law had been outlined and an internal review conducted.
Currently, the possession or use of any amount of marijuana is a crime under federal law. In his email, Barreira expressed concern that any Harvard students convicted of drug crimes can jeopardize their federal aid eligibility. At Harvard, more than $15 million in federal aid is given to students each year.
Economics lecturer Jeffrey A. Miron, a known advocate for the legalization of medical marijuana, said that because of the conflict between state and federal law, he can understand Harvard’s hesitation to allow medical marijuana on campus or to have UHS involved in distributing medical marijuana certifications.
 
According to Miron, any broad change in Harvard’s policies regarding marijuana can also jeopardize federal funding given to the University, and not just individual students.
“I think that UHS would be in a very awkward position, because the University still gets lots of federal funding. The University is still subject to all various kinds of federal regulations,” Miron said.
“It’s one thing if every other big university in Massachusetts was already doing this. You don’t want to be the first,” he added.
In fact, Barreira said that no college or university in Massachusetts has modified its drug policies as a result of the new state law legalizing medical marijuana. Many universities in states with legalized or medicalized marijuana, such as the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Colorado at Boulder, continue to prohibit use of all kinds of marijuana on campus.
Despite Harvard’s existing policies, Barreira said that, in light of the new law, he encourages all students, faculty, and staff who believe that marijuana might help address a serious medical condition to speak directly with their physician and explore an “alternative treatment plan.”
No medical marijuana dispensaries have opened yet in Massachusetts, although 20 dispensaries have been given provisional approval. After successfully completing the next phases of the approval process, dispensaries may begin operating as early as this summer. Currently, the only dispensary set to open in Cambridge will be operated by Greeneway Wellness Foundation, which has received a provisional license.
 
”The well-being of every member of the Harvard community continues to be a paramount consideration,” Barreira said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a beautiful weekend in Maryland for the No. 19 Harvard sailing team, which raced in its first regatta of the 2014 spring season Saturday and Sunday. The Crimson finished in a three-way tie for seventh place in the St. Mary’s Team Race, which showcased 420 and FJ racing from 10 schools.
Harvard split its score, 2-2, after the first day, but lost its three races on Sunday to put it at 2-7 and tied for seventh with Fordham and Hobart and William Smith. Stanford took first with a perfect score of 14-0.
“Well, it was honestly not our top performance,” sophomore Andrew Mollerus said. “We have a lot of work to do over the next few weeks. We lost a lot of very close races.”
The Crimson sent mostly underclassmen to compete in the regatta. Along with Mollerus, junior Gram Slattery and sophomore Marek Zaleski acted as skippers. Sophomore Sydney Karnovsky and freshmen Julia Lord and Emma Wheeler were the crews.
“Our recognition of the correct plays was pretty good,” Harvard coach Michael O’Connor said. “But our execution of the plays was not.”
The greatest challenge for the Crimson was its lack of practice during the winter, according to O’Connor.
“Our weekend did not go as well as we had hoped, but it is understandable considering we haven’t been able to practice as a unit,” O’Connor said. “As a result our boat handling was rusty, which limited our ability to execute plays the way we wanted.”
Freezing conditions in Cambridge has kept the Charles solid. Two home regattas, the Sharpe and Wood Trophies, were canceled over the last two weekends.
“We haven’t been able to practice this year due to the conditions,” Mollerus said. “The temperatures have been very atypical.”
The Crimson has been on the water twice for about two hours total in practice this season. Mollerus compared this to previous years, when at this point his team would have been on the water for a few weeks, with 20-30 hours total.
“We’re aware of this disadvantage,” he said. “We’re prepared to put a lot of hard work in.”
Despite the unfavorable results over the weekend, Harvard sailing is optimistic about the upcoming season.
“This regatta was a good starting point for us this season,” O’Connor said. “We know what we need to work on, and we know that we have the potential to play at the top level.”
Warming up for the season is the next step for the Crimson.
“It’s in the team’s mindset to make the big push and shake off the rust,” Mollerus added. “We have the right people and the right set-up, so this race won’t be that big of a setback for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Let’s play hockey.”
The chant rang out loud and clear on the Yale side of the Payne Whitney Gymnasium on Friday night in New Haven, Conn. as the Harvard men’s basketball team closed in on a third straight outright Ivy League Championship. A couple of blocks away at Ingalls Rink, however, the Bulldogs were in the process of thoroughly dismantling the Crimson, 4-0, in game one of the first round of the ECAC Men’s Hockey Tournament.
The pecking order of Harvard’s Big Two winter teams was in sharp focus this week. While men’s basketball opened SportsCenter the next morning as the first team in the country to punch its ticket to March Madness, men’s hockey fell in the first round of its conference tournament for the second straight season.
In the lead-up to this past weekend, SB Nation published a long-form feature on men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, in which writer David Tannenwald explores the social impact that Amaker’s squad has had on Harvard. Since Amaker arrived from Michigan in 2007, the Crimson’s following has grown rapidly—so much so that University President Drew G. Faust has reportedly described home men’s basketball games at Lavietes Pavilion as “the most diverse event on Harvard’s campus.”
But once upon a time, men’s hockey was the school’s social touchstone. In the late 1980s, legendary coach Bill Cleary ’56 and his team packed the Bright Center weekly as the Crimson made reaching the Frozen Four a near-annual tradition. Students stood in long lines across the Yard for ECAC Tournament tickets in 1989, the year Cleary's kids took home Harvard's first NCAA team title in any sport.
The icemen developed a committed undergraduate fan base, led by the infamous and masked “Harvard Hares.” The Hares traveled well, outshouting opposing crowds up and down the Northeast.
This week, I don’t think I saw any Harvard Athletics promotions to bus students down to New Haven for a hockey game. I certainly didn’t see any masked rabble-rousers at Ingalls.
A question for the Harvard men’s hockey team as it enters the offseason is whether this pecking order is truly a New Harvard Athletics World Order, or just a passing fad. The Crimson skaters will begin to decide that question for themselves next year.
When Harvard’s young guns retake the ice next October, they will not be so young. The Crimson’s beleaguered bench backers and highly-touted prospects will face more pressure than ever before to prove that prep school and junior league ringers can consistently develop, excel, and win in Cambridge.
Harvard’s reputation as a men’s hockey school is at stake. Since 2007, Amaker has out-recruited the competition. Men’s hockey coach Ted Donato ’91 has, too. I don’t care what you say about Academic Index or Tom Stemberg conspiracy theories; in the last decade, Donato’s team has attracted top talent year after year.
Donato’s recruiting crown jewel was, arguably, the class of 2013. A 2009 blog post by Hockey News columnist Ryan Kennedy hailed a Crimson class headed by Louis Leblanc and Alex Fallstrom ‘13 as the cream of the ECAC crop. Four years later, Leblanc had long-bolted for the pros, and the remaining 2013ers left Cambridge without a conference ring to their names after becoming the first Harvard class to graduate in the ECAC cellar.
Because NCAA hockey teams accept commitments from junior skaters two or three years before they arrive on campus, Harvard has yet to feel the impact of this most recent lack of success on the recruiting circuit. The Crimson’s class of 2016 and class of 2017 also ranked among the top in the nation. Whether or not Harvard continues to attract skilled players on its reputation alone, one more losing season would send the wrong message to a full team’s worth of prospective recruits: “If you want to win, go to Yale.”
With the graduation of the 2013 class, the 2013-2014 season was always going to be a rebuilding year. By game two on Saturday, however, the Crimson looked more “broken down” than rebuilt.
Harvard entered the night with freshman stars Alex Kerfoot and Luke Esposito sidelined by upper body injuries, and the team also lacked the services of seven other skaters with whom it began its season.
On one hand, the depleted squad’s performance pointed to the team’s promise on a night in which the defending national champions barely edged the Crimson, 2-1. On the other, the visitors’ lack of personnel reflected a pattern in which the program has failed to put forth its full potential.
The true legacy of this season will not become clear until next year. In the meantime, we can only speculate. Will the Crimson’s young lines begin to click? Will potential recruits continue to buy into Donato’s system? Will Kerfoot and company get through four years in one piece?
All these questions are important because they feed into a bigger question:
“Hey, do you want to go to Lavietes tonight?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the NCAA Northeast Regionals in Wellesley, Mass. early Sunday morning, Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand hoped to qualify the maximum 12 fencers for the NCAA Championships, less than two weeks away.
After a 12-hour day of fencing, the Crimson came away with eight medals as a team, and the group’s enthusiasm could only be tempered by the likelihood that they came one short of Brand’s goal.
“We were hoping to qualify the maximum in order to have a good shot at winning the [co-ed] national title,” Brand said. “With 11 [fencers], it’s going to be difficult.”
Fencers can earn spots by medaling at the regional event or by having a combination of a strong performance at a regional event and a high seeding, with up to two fencers in each weapon for men and women coming from the same school. The NCAA will announce the final spots for the championship competition on Tuesday.
“The Northeast region is the toughest in college fencing,” Brand said. “Overall, I’m very pleased with how things turned out.”
WOMEN’S FENCING
Harvard earned five medals on the day in the three weapons on the women’s side, and also secured at least five spots in the NCAA Championships.
Sophomore Isabel DiTella told the gold medal in the 49-competitor épeé event, while freshman foilist Adrienne Jarocki continued her stellar campaign with a perfect 11-0 finish to cruise to the top spot in her weapon.
After jumping out to a 12-0 record with a plus-31 indicator in the opening pool rounds, DiTella tallied nine bout wins in the medal round to claim the gold. The medal was the first in her career with the Crimson.
The hotly contested 12-competitor final pool came down to the wire, but sophomore Nina Van Loon’s seven victories  in épeé combined with a plus-3 indicator was just enough for the bronze and a spot at the NCAA Championships.
In her second-to-last collegiate event, co-captain Alexandra Kiefer finished a single touch behind St. John’s Marta Hausman for the gold medal in foil. Though the senior defeated Hausman, 4-3, in the medal round, the Crimson standout’s plus-21 indicator was one shy of her opponent’s. Kiefer finishes her Crimson career having medaled in each of the four NCAA Northeast Regionals, including a gold in her freshman year.
Not to be outdone by her teammates, Jarocki thoroughly dismantled her opponents in the final round, recording a plus-44 indicator in 11 bouts.
“I was losing 4-1 [to Lew], but I fought back and won,” Jarocki said. “What I was doing wasn’t really working, but I was able to figure it out…. [Brand] told me to not use direct attacks, and that worked.”
The top-ranked fencer wasn’t the only Crimson foilist to end her day on the podium. Sophomore Aliya Itzkowitz finished 8-3 in the medal pool at the end of the day, with two of her losses coming against her teammates. Her eight bout victories were enough to claim the silver behind her freshman teammate.
“[Aliya and I] came into the tournament ranked first and second, and then we ended the tournament ranked first and second,” Jarocki said. “She was fencing extremely well.”
MEN’S FENCING
The Harvard men’s team collectively had a strong day by any metric, with three fencers earning medals and several others turning in fine performances as well. The Crimson had its strongest day on the foil side, with sophomore Michael Woo and junior Brian Kaneshige taking silver and bronze, respectively. Woo claimed eight bouts as well as the best indicator of the medal round pool.
Junior Alexander Ryjik earned the last of three medals for the Harvard men with a 7-4 bout record in the final round of sabre. The bronze was the second career NCAA regional medal for the Alexandria, Va. native.
On the épeé side, the senior-freshman duo of Michael Raynis and Alexander Eldeib took sixth and seventh, respectively. The former finished his day with 17 total wins, and the latter had 15.
According to Brand, both will likely qualify for the championships.Now all that’s left for the season for both squads is a plane ride to Columbus, Ohio for collegiate fencing’s biggest competition.
“We have a very, very strong contingent [of fencers] going into [NCAA’s],” Brand said. “We certainly have some really good contenders for the individual title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season of hard work, grueling training and dedication finally culminated for the Harvard wrestling team this weekend at the EIWA Championships in Philadelphia.
But no season came to a more illustrious fruition than Todd Preston’s.The sophomore defeated Hofstra redshirt senior Luke Vaith at 141 pounds, 8-6, in second sudden victory overtime to clinch the Crimson’s first individual EIWA title since 2010.
Preston became the 21st wrestler in Crimson history to claim an EIWA title and the first Harvard titlist in the 141 division since Dustin DeNunzio ’98 claimed the crown in 1998.
Overall, Preston’s win was the team’s first EIWA Championship triumph since current Harvard assistant coach J.P. O’Connor ’10 claimed victory at 157 en route to an undefeated season and NCAA championship in 2010.
“It felt really good [to win],” Preston said. “Especially with [O’Connor] as my coach now. He’s been giving me the confidence to achieve my goals this year…. Without him, I don’t think I would have been able to accomplish this.”
Preston also became the fourth Crimson wrestler ever to receive the tournament’s Most Outstanding Wrestler award and the first since Jesse Jantzen ’04 at 149. Harvard coach Jay Weiss and his staff recognized Preston’s potential at the beginning of the season.
“The coaches knew how good [Preston] was early on,” Weiss said. “It was just a matter of time for him to figure out how good he is. He really started doing that the past five to six weeks of the season, and he was very strong this past weekend. I’m just happy for him…. He kept his composure, worked hard, and did a nice job.”
The sophomore entered the weekend seeded fourth in the conference and ranked 15th nationally. Preston swept his four matches at the championships. He began by defeating Sacred Heart junior Andrew Polidore and Lehigh sophomore Laike Gardner on Saturday.
On Sunday,  he shut out Boston University junior Tyler Scotton, 5-0, in the semifinal and edging the ninth-ranked Vaith in the championship match on Sunday.
In the final, Vaith took a 2-0 first period advantage before Preston earned a reversal to tie the score at the end of the opening stanza. The Crimson wrestler would score an escape point in the second period to edge a point ahead, but Vaith took control in the third period with an escape and a stalling call.
As time expired, it appeared that Vaith would clinch his first EIWA title. But with just over 10 seconds left in regulation, Preston scored a late takedown to force overtime.
Both wrestlers obtained an escape in the first extra frame, as a defensive stance by Preston held Vaith at bay for the majority of the period.In the second overtime session, Preston evaded a shot and outmaneuvered Vaith, scoring the decisive takedown and claiming the crown.
The title marks the high point of what has been a breakout season for the young star. After a freshman season that was littered with injuries, limiting Preston to a mere 13 appearances on the mat, the sophomore posted a 23-8 overall record to lead the Harvard men and earn All-Ivy League second team accolades.
With the top-five conference finish, Preston earned his first NCAA Championship bid. He will be Harvard’s sole representative in Oklahoma City on March 20-22. The Hampton, N.J., native is looking forward to competing on the national stage.
“I’m just going to have fun,” Preston said. “It’s just another tournament—just more fans, more people supporting, [and] that’s all it is. It’s an opportunity to have fun and do the sport I love. That’s how I’m approaching it.”
This easygoing attitude should help Preston later this month. Weiss noticed that Preston carried a similar mindset into the EIWA Tournament.
“The night before [the tournament] we had a meeting,” Weiss said. “He was really loose and relaxed, to the point where he left the room, came back, and [asked me] if [being relaxed] was the right thing to do. It just showed how relaxed he was.... He just wanted to take it one match at a time.”
Preston’s efforts helped lead the Crimson to a ninth place finish out of 18 teams in the tournament, the second straight year in which Harvard finished inside of the top 10. Harvard also finished with the third highest result out of the six Ivy League schools in the EIWA, beating 10th-place host Penn, 12th-place Princeton, and 16th-place Brown, while finishing behind fifth-place Columbia and champion Cornell.

Tuesday night was business as usual for Harvard (10-5, 7-2 EIVA). An overall clinical performance, headlined by solid offensive play, powered the Crimson to a 3-0, straight-set victory over Marymount (6-12, 3-5 Continental).
“It felt good,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “A match like that, a lot just comes down to the mental part of the game and…the guys did a good job.”
The victory extended the Crimson’s home win streak at the Malkin Athletic Center to six games. It began as a very one-sided affair with a score of 6-4 giving way to a swift 16-point advantage, including 14 straight unanswered points from the Crimson. Within minutes of the opening serve, Harvard had won the first set, 25-6, in a whirlwind start.
Senior captain Chris Gibbons said the team saw the match as a chance to display some of the skills it has been working on of late against unfamiliar opponents.
“We didn’t know much about the other team, so we were sort of just focusing on what we were doing on our side of the net,” Gibbons said. “We’ve been working on this stuff in practice, so this is just an opportunity for us to execute that in a match.”
The last two sets were more contested. Absent 14-point runs and easy finishes, the second and third saw slightly better defense from the Saints and a     somewhat less aggressive game from the Crimson.  At no point, however, did Harvard lose the lead.
The closest Marymount came was a one-point gap in the second, but throughout the match it was the Crimson that was in charge.
“They sort of passed a little better and screened a little bit harder [in the second and third sets],” Gibbons said. “Maybe there were a couple lapses of focus where we gave them a few too many points…but sometimes matches will go by quickly like that, and sometimes the sets are a little slower.”
The final scores of 25-6, 25-14 and 25-17 were indicative of a high quality Harvard performance. The .448 hitting percentage was the highest the Crimson has had in a game in the season so far, and the best since April last year. Individual performances were strong as well, as sophomore outside hitter Alec Schlossman registered a career-high seven kills. Freshman outside hitter Casey White contributed 13 kills of his own, and junior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick added eight.
The defensive end was also solid, as Marymount’s hitting percentage was reduced to -.093. Freshman Bryce Ernsberger and junior Brett Refner each contributed only seven kills for the Saints, though a few of those delayed a Harvard match point in the final set.
“We didn’t play well against George Mason on Friday night, came back against Princeton and we’re pretty sharp again—the ways that we have been for a lot of the season,” Baise said. “Tonight, I thought we had a return to form. We made good decisions, and we kept the ball in play.”
Although Marymount’s 86 kill attempts outnumbered Harvard’s 67, the dramatic difference resulted in 16 more kills for Harvard.
Errors were another area of difference, as Harvard’s count of six was 22 less than that of the Saints’ 28. Defensively, Harvard’s 33 digs were superior to the 22 of Marymount.
“It was a pretty smooth win,” Gibbons said. “We were in control the entire time, but with matches like these, the main thing that we’re looking at is just to have focus throughout the entire match. When you’re up big, it’s easy to lose focus and sort of slack off and go 50 percent. So that was what we were really working on, going 100 percent and working on the stuff we’ve been trying to at practice.”
The team will travel to Ball State and Ohio State this week as it seeks out some stiffer non-conference competition. However, a  win as dominant as this will always be music to Baise’s ears. The coach said he took the evening’s encounter as encouraging news as the team moves ahead.
“We saw some different lineups, which was important as we head to the second half of the season,” Baise said. “I was happy to see that we did take care of the business from our side of the net.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On July 8, 2012, Katey Stone, the Landry Family Head Coach for Harvard women’s ice hockey, was named the head coach of the USA Olympic Women’s Team, breaking barriers as the first woman to hold this post. As Stone prepared to depart from her office at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center and leave the Crimson in different hands for the first time since the 1993-1994 season, chatter began to brew about how Harvard would fare in her absence. When it became clear that several members of Stone’s team would join her in Sochi, the chatter intensified.
During the 2009-2010 season, defending national champion Wisconsin saw its head coach Mark Johnson and two players depart for the Vancouver Olympics. The Badgers barely broke .500 and failed to make the NCAA Tournament. The picture couldn’t be more different for Stone and Harvard interim head coach Maura Crowell.
To an outsider, regardless of any pre-season shouts and murmurs, the Crimson appears to be doing quite well without Stone—a three-time ECAC Coach of the Year—and the trio of current Crimson skaters who spent the year training for the Olympics. With a first round NCAA Tournament game on Saturday and an Ivy League crown under their belts, the women of the Crimson look as strong as ever.
Facing fifth-seed No. 3 Wisconsin, No. 6 Harvard will go to its first-ever national tournament without Stone, but the team is in skillful hands. Appointed in April 2013, Crowell has shown what a small but talented group is capable of.
Crowell, who joined the Crimson in 2009, was a tremendously successful head coach for UMass Boston. Under her guidance, Harvard has fought to a 23-6-4 record overall with only three conference losses—just one win away from equaling last season’s record.
Meanwhile, after Cornell spent three straight seasons alone atop the Ancient Eight and shared the conference title last year, the Crimson finally captured the Ivy League Championship—meaningless in utility, full of meaning in pride.
On the ice, Crowell has trained her depleted roster to the highest standard. Harvard posts a team defense just a spot outside the top five nationally and an offense that is currently ranked eighth in the country.
Individually, sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer built upon her rookie campaign to post the fourth-highest save percentage in the country (.943) despite stumbling in recent weeks. Backing up Maschmeyer between the pipes, freshman Brianna Laing has shown grace under pressure with seven starts and seven wins to her name. Crowell called up Laing most recently in the final two games of the ECAC quarterfinal round against Yale, when stops were crucial to extending Harvard’s season.
Despite having just 18 players—three short of the maximum number of players allowed to suit up for a game—Crowell and her squad have still managed to contend and beat the best in the nation. Without defenders Michelle Picard ’15-16 and Josephine Pucci ’13-15 and forward Lyndsey Fry ’14-15, last year’s second-leading scorer, a new cast of characters has jumped to the forefront of the team. Sophomore forward Miye D’Oench broke through on offense to more than double her scoring output from last season, while juniors Samantha Reber and Hillary Crowe have continued to produce on offense.
Crowell’s success is neither a fluke nor entirely unexpected. It’s impossible to grow without strong roots. Just as her coaching and the play of the team this year has been exceptional, so too is the historic strength of Harvard women’s ice hockey program under Stone. The team would not be here without Crowell and the hard work of this year’s squad, nor would it have the opportunity without Stone’s 19 seasons of consistent excellence.
Yesterday, you may have read of the troubles facing the men’s hockey program and Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. While the men’s program has undergone a flurry of injuries and withdrawals, there is still plenty to be seen at the Bright. Though the days of the 1989 NCAA Tournament Champion team may have passed, there’s another national title up for grabs, waiting at the sticks and skates of the women’s team.
Though the ECAC title evaded Crowell’s Crimson this year, and Stone’s Team USA was stunned by Canada in the gold medal match in Sochi, the future is as bright as ever for women’s hockey.

Not all housing day videos are created equal. After Kirkland’s Housing Committee took down several of their Beyoncé-themed 2014 Housing Day videos due to inappropriate material, upperclassmen turned in a different aesthetic direction to give the Class of 2017 an idea of what they can expect should they be placed in Kirkland come next Thursday.
In a video entitled “We Didn’t Start the Kirkland,” created by Kirkland House residents Brian J. Mendel ‘15, Ian B. Nightingale ‘15, and current Crimson FM chair Petey E. Menz ‘15, the creators can be heard crooning sweet harmonies to the tune of “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” by Billy Joel. The visuals keep pace with a steady beat as a PowerPoint presentation rapidly transitions from one slide to another using the classic “cube” transition. Impressively, the video even features some virtual animated fire as the vocalists sing a chorus of “We didn’t start the Kirkland / It was always Kirkland / since the world went Kirkland.”
 


 
When asked about the video’s origins, Mendel said that “no one asked us to make it. Actually we made another video last year called ‘Tastes Like Kirkland House,’ but probably no one saw it because we spelled Kirkland wrong, just like this year.” 
Last year’s video, entitled “KIKRLAND HOUSING DAY OFFICIAL 2013,” is adapted from the song “Tastes like Wonton Soup” by Lil B. As for their inspiration, Mendel said that he, Nightingale, and Menz noted that “what a housing video really entails is picking a song and changing the lyrics to be about the house in question. So we took this formula to its logical conclusion, by changing all of the words to the name of our house.”
 
Not to be outdone, on March 8 another group of students published “HASTILY MADE KIRKLAND HOUSING DAY VIDEO,” a forty-five second musical ditty praising the, ahem, less recognized aspects of Kirkland House. The video features expert camera zooms and iMovie transitions, as the vocalists harmonize to lyrics like “Come on down to Kirkland House everyone / Take a look at both of our trash cans… Who the f**k still uses a red phone / Take a Crimson to use in the bathroom.”
 
One of its creators, Wyatt N. Troia ‘14 (who is affiliated with Winthrop house, but lives off campus at the Sigma Chi fraternity house), wrote in an email, “After their first videos caused such controversy, the Kirkland HoCo reached out to ask me to create a new housing day video for them. I was honored and surprised, considering that I am not in Kirkland and had no experience making housing day videos. Though I'm a Winthropian, I'd never turn down a House in need, and just hope I did Kirkland justice.”
 


 
As for the production team, he wrote, “Krishnan S. Ramanujan ‘14 wrote the lyrics, Kevin S. B. Meers ‘14 sang lead, and I filmed and dusted off my falsetto to do the harmonies. Andrew A. Fraga ‘17 graciously allowed the filming of his red phone. Benjamin P. Runkle* helpfully uploaded the video to his Youtube account.” The video’s concept was inspired by the “HASTILY MADE CLEVELAND TOURISM VIDEO.”
 
And as if there weren’t enough nontraditional housing videos to go around, YouTube user and presumable Adams House resident “Adams PfoCo” published “Hotel Adams,” a video to the tune of “Hotel California” by the Eagles, inspired by the PowerPoint aesthetic and questionable harmonies of “We Didn’t Start the Kirkland.” Beautiful lyrics include, “Welcome to the Hotel A-a-a-a-dams / Such a lovely Adams / Such a lovely Adams.”
 


 
Get excited freshman! Best four years of your life!
 
 *Benjamin Piatt Runkle (b. 1836, d. 1916) is one of the founders of Sigma Chi fraternity, not a Harvard College student.

Happy Tuesday!
Enjoy today’s breezy weather as foreshadowing of the spring break to come. You will literally almost be able to feel it. Crack open a window and soak up some sun before retreating back to your personal cave of papers, midterms, and projects. The end is in sight.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Tomorrow’s high is a downright balmy 54 degrees, with sunshine forecasted for the entire afternoon. Break out the flip flops and the tank tops, everybody, this is basically our first official day of summer. And maybe also our last—there’s a storm coming in on Thursday that’s supposed to drop off 4-8 inches of snow. Bottom line: Enjoy the sun while you can.

2) Kirkland Housing Day Videos Spark Controversy, Conversation. Kirkland released 10 housing day videos this year, but promptly took them down after they were met with backlash from students. 
3) Pantry’s Closure Will Leave Void in Harvard Square Daytime Homeless Services. “Bread and Jams drop-in shelter serves the daytime needs of Harvard Square’s homeless population by providing hot meals and a warm place to stay five days a week. But recent changes in federal funding for homelessness services will force the shelter to shut its doors on March 25 after decades in operation.”

Currier House brought pre-Housing Day fever to new heights with an email from “dean.donald.pfister@gmail.com.” Complete with a fungus reference, a tree-themed book recommendation, and an invitation to join “the Dean” at the park, it bore all of the marks of a classic Pfister correspondence.
 For a minute, we thought Harvard’s favorite “fun-uncle-Dean” was up to his usual tricks. But no—a controversy!
The email, which introduced Currier’s Housing Day video “What Does the Tree Say?”, could be a violation of a policy because it kind of hacked the email of an administrator, we think. (Does anyone know where we could find Dean Hammonds to ask her about this?).
This brouhaha is the most controversial story in Housing Day news since yesterday, when Kirkland took down its video featuring women in bikinis.
Our advice? Calm down about housing! It’s really not a big deal—I mean, Flyby’s not even ranking them this year.

The results are unanimous—freshmen, are you ready?
Check back on March 12 for the complete unveiling of Flyby's 2014 Housing Market.
Are the SAT and ACT too distanced from the current work of high school students? This question has been debated for a while, but with the recent changes to the SAT, the president of the College Board, David Coleman, has also joined the discussion.
But does this issue of the SAT and ACT's "irrelevance" entirely miss the point of these tests? If, as the College Board claims, the SAT and ACT are designed to test general knowledge, then the purpose of these tests does not need to closely resemble what schools teach students. If test-makers want to use these exams to tell college admissions officers something about “natural intelligence,” then the tests should not be expected to closely resemble what students learn in school at all.
The announcement of the new SAT brought to the forefront many of the dissatisfactions that students, teachers and parents have with the standardized exams: they can be “gamed.” The content of the test, as it currently stands, favors those who can afford a tutor to teach them the tricks of the test, or who can afford to take them multiple times. This is the glaringly identifiable problem with standardized testing today. The new changes are meant to combat this issue by tying the SAT more closely to the materials the general high school curriculum.
But does linking the SAT to what students learn in school, as the ACT is already known to do, really solve this problem? I argue that it does not. Students with greater access to resources generally do better already, no matter the format of the test. The problem has been clearly identified, but this solution achieves the direct opposite of the purpose of the reforms.
Let me explain: a student who goes to a good school will still have teachers that will discuss and engage with materials that will be on the new test, such as the important literary documents in America’s history. When given a question about one of these documents on the SAT, this student will have had all of the advantages of engaging with this material in class and analyzing it, prior to seeing it on the SAT.
Meanwhile, a student who attended a worse high school may still have read some of these documents privately, yet the history teacher may not have opened up a discussion for analyzing these documents to the same extent as the SAT now expects.
So who is more advantaged? Clearly, the student who already has access to a better school and better resources will still perform better. Despite trying to make the test fairer by using knowledge that is supposedly more accessible to everyone taking the test, test-makers are creating an exam that is still discriminatory.
As I have said, the problem has been addressed but the proposed solution is not viable. In order to make the SAT and the ACT fairer, test-makers should make the tests more random. They should include information that students would not have necessarily ever seen, and make each test completely different, so that no amount of preparation could give someone an advantage. Stepping into the realm of randomness on tests will more accurately reflect the knowledge of the test-taker, and not the resources and opportunities that they were provided.
