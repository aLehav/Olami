After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are several ways one might describe Disclosure's new album “Caracal.” Here's one: hits, toms, snaps, clicks, kicks and some synths. Another: a masterpiece. Save a few portions that cause the album to drag near the end, it is a truly exceptional work.
Typically, listening to a Disclosure track is like experiencing a wave in sonic form. The groove comes in first and departs last, commanding the listener’s attention from the first beat to the last fading synth. Since the rise of 1970-1980s era house and hip-hop and the advent of musical sampling, popular music has been all about the beat. The Lawrence brothers know this well, and, as was the case with their last album, “Settle,” it’s easy to recognize the borderline-obsessive attention they bring to their work. It's a sort of attention that seems to defy precedent most anywhere else in the electronic and popular music industries. Incredibly—impossibly—everything from their drums to their synths feel more organic, more special than ever before, from the crazy precision of housier tracks like “Holding On” to the subtle shakes and claps that fit underneath the rich organ and flanging baseline of “Willing and Able.”
This is Disclosure in three-dimensions—the duo often combines size and movement to great effect. “Nocturnal,” which clocks in at nearly seven minutes, is a weighty beginning. While that gravity initially feels sluggish, the track builds and builds. The forward momentum of the chords and insistent beat ushers in the rest of the album, especially when second, third, and fourth listens allow a holistic appreciation for the deliberate, slow movement of the piece as a whole. Meanwhile, “Hourglass” features a technicolor patchwork of sounds, with subtle plucks, hits, and strings supporting expertly harmonized vocals courtesy of Lion Babe’s Jillian Hervey. All of these pieces combine with a desperate sense of movement that gives Hervey's vocal line special salience as she insists "Time’s up!” before a wall of sound drops into a persistently catchy ball of reverb-heavy house.
Disclosure loves its up-and-coming collaborators. The duo once again rounds up a group of British niche talents, whose most compelling performances concentrate in the middle of the album. “Holding On” injects a slice of rich jazz with a mesmerizing [vocal line by Gregory Porter over a tumultuous house beat. “Willing & Able” stands out, mostly as a result of a smooth, sexy, and deeply stirring KWABS vocal that is arguably the most sincere, emotional performance of the entire album. Only Sam Smith’s legendary “Omen” vocals, which truly capture the resolve of a man dete­­rmined to go “all in,” as he repeatedly and listlessly insists in the lyrics, is possibly more compelling. On “Magnets,” Lorde exemplifies her defiant, edgy style of performance. Sure, the track’s shimmering cowbells and snares burst brightly at the edges of this dark record, but even they can’t cut as sharply as the track’s lyrics.
Some vocal pairings make less sense than others. For instance, though “Nocturnal” features The Weeknd on vocals, “Masterpiece, ” with its big sparkling chords, background plucks, and a hip-hop beat, feels more in line with his style than the former track. Meanwhile, “Good Intentions” brings Disclosure and Miguel together in a more minimal production, but the vocal work just feels like a slightly smoother-than-normal stock Disclosure voice. Miguel’s presence is difficult to notice.
Even though they have a bevy of featured artists, Disclosure does well performing their own vocals, and this time they take center stage on “Jaded,” “Echoes,” “Molecules” and “Afterthought.” Like Calvin Harris before them, they have no illusions; they aren’t Sam Smith caliber singers, and they don’t have to be. In fact, as a duo as known for shirking away from the spotlight as for their fantastic music, their simple vocal choices fit their brand perfectly, somehow maintaining their anonymity while also epitomizing their famous, pure, not-quite-robotic sound. That said, “Echoes” feels a bit like old territory—it plays like one too many house tracks with a lack of identity other than “another Disclosure track.” Meanwhile, “Afterthought,” in combination with “Moving Mountains,” make for a relatively forgettable ending to the Deluxe version of an otherwise stellar album.
Is this the album fans were waiting for? There is no easy answer. Disclosure acolytes [have been known to argue over the group’s underground roots and its ever-increasing pop icon status as much as they enjoy their actual music. It is, however, apparent that Disclosure continues to masterfully balance genres. Don’t give “Caracal” just one listen. Give it five, then decide. If you are patient enough to abide a few minor stumbles, the genius of Disclosure’s soundshow will begin to emerge in subtle nuances offering an audiophilic lesson in sub-genres and the complexity of electronic music and its roots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the early 1900’s, a young girl named Emilia Diaz from Ojuelos, Jalisco, fled her homeland after her father was gunned down by an assassin during the Mexican revolution. With tears in her eyes, and a few of her most prized possessions stuffed into a pack, she and her sisters set off for America—the one place they felt could offer them a brighter future. Emilia was tired. She would soon be poor. But as was promised, America lifted her lamp beside the golden door and welcomed Emilia and her sisters with love.
Two generations later, my own reality looks very different from my grandmother’s. As a second-generation American, I walked the stage at high school graduation, college graduation, right into Harvard Square, where I’d earn my Master’s degree from our nation’s finest university. I’ve been part of our democracy as a presidential campaign staffer, then as a local candidate myself. Through all of it, I’ve felt my grandmother by my side. This, I can’t help but think, is exactly what she had in mind.
Of course, our story is neither unique nor universal. America remains both a place where hard-working people can find success and one where too few hard working people do.
When we begin to unpack this complex problem, we confront the realities of our public schools again and again, where low-income students are far less likely to graduate than their more affluent counterparts. It is a systemically perpetuated injustice that is keeping kids and families in oppressive cycles of poverty. In a system where last year, the majority of students qualified as low-income, maintaining the status quo will quickly translate to a majority of kids and families whose opportunities and life prospects are chained.
But when they do get the support they need, they become unstoppable. As a Teach For America corps member in Dallas, I had the privilege of teaching Eduardo, an eighth grade ESL student with learning disabilities. The year before I taught him, Eduardo failed to pass any of his state exams. He took those failures to heart. In one of our first, I starting listing all the things we would do to get him ready to pass the U.S. History state exam. He interrupted me with a laugh. “No way. Never going to happen.”
My first task became clear. I had to reframe the way he thought about himself and his abilities. So I taught him to see his labels as assets. Special education meant he was a hard worker; school didn’t come easy to him but he identified ways to succeed regardless. ESL meant that he had a leg up on others because he would soon be fluent in two languages while many of us can only speak one.
Over the course of the year, Eduardo embraced this challenge and soon volunteered for leadership positions in my class. He made it a goal to not only pass the state exam, but to attain a commended score (the equivalent of missing fewer than seven questions on the test).
After that exam had been scored, I held a ceremony in my class where each student received a handwritten note from me letting them know their grade and how proud I was of them. During Eduardo’s class I held his back until the end of class. After all the students left for lunch, I handed the note to Eduardo. He opened it, stared at the paper, and then looked at me in disbelief. He had passed the 8th grade social studies exam—with commendation. I thought his hug might knock me over.
As a second generation Mexican American born into a family scratching the bottom surface of the middle class in a declining city east of Houston, Texas, I wasn’t supposed to succeed. But with my family’s steadfast support and unyielding belief in the power of education, I have had the chance to chase my professional and personal passions. For me, this means helping the next generation of kids who look like me discover their own.
America has always represented a hope that life can be better. It has taken in those who have been persecuted and just plain beat down elsewhere and given them the opportunity to rewrite their futures. It’s up to our generation to ensure that we deliver on that promise for every single child who grows up with a dream. They are our future. Let’s set them up to achieve it.
Miguel Solis received a Master’s in Education Policy from Harvard in 2012. He is a Teach For America-Dallas-Fort Worth alum and currently serves as the first Vice President of the Dallas Independent School District Board of Trustees. He is the President of the Latino Center for Leadership Development.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: OCT. 16, 2015 at 9:05 p.m.
The silence is deafening.
Two weeks ago, Palestinian terrorists shot two parents to death as they were driving home with their four children in the backseat of their car. Two days later, in the Old City of Jerusalem, a Palestinian stabbed two Israelis to death. As the wife of one of the victims lay on the ground slashed and crying for help, Arab passersby spat on her and laughed. Her two-year old was beside her, also stabbed by the terrorist. A few hours later, a terrorist in Jerusalem stabbed a 15-year-old boy.
Last week in Israel, hundreds of terrorist attacks occurred around the country. More than a dozen people were injured in stabbing attacks. In one attack, a Palestinian mob pelted an Israeli woman’s car with stones and then attempted to drag her out—presumably to abduct or to murder her. In another attack, a terrorist stabbed a soldier and stole his rifle, and then barged into the home of a young woman and attempted to stab her.
This past Tuesday, two terrorists stormed a bus with a pistol and knives, and began to stab those on board. Many were seriously injured. Two were murdered. That same morning, a Palestinian terrorist rammed his car into a group of people waiting for a bus in Jerusalem. He then exited the car and proceeded to viciously attack them with a meat cleaver. One man was hacked to death. Also on Tuesday, two stabbings occurred within 90 minutes of each other outside of a rehabilitation center in the central city of Ra'anana; five were wounded.
But the world is silent.
Imagine that terrorists were stabbing to death Americans who were on their daily walks to the supermarket. Imagine that terrorists were driving their cars into crowds of New York commuters waiting for the train. Imagine if driving on a Chicago highway were dangerous because a lynch mob could surround your car at any moment. Imagine having to kiss your family members goodbye each morning, unsure if you would survive the day. The world would not be silent.
Israel is experiencing an onslaught of vicious terrorism. The attacks are terrorizing the entire country. Citizens have begun sleeping with knives on their bed tables and young parents are drafting wills for their preschool children.
But the world is not listening. Newspapers have failed to document the extent and nature of the egregious murders on their front pages. World leaders have yet to issue condemnations of Palestinian aggression. One could watch a variety of daily news shows and be unaware that anything out of the ordinary has been happening in Israel.
Instead of legitimately addressing the terrorism crisis, a recent BBC headline reads: “Palestinian shot dead after Jerusalem attack kills two;” the Palestinian had just slashed two men to death. The headline of a Monday Wall Street Journal article stated: “Israeli Police Fatally Shoot Two Palestinian Teen Attackers, Injure Two Others;” these terrorists stabbed Israeli civilians and officers with knives. These deceiving headlines might have you mistakenly believe that Israelis are the perpetrators.
Instead of recognizing the profound unrest and rise of Palestinian terrorism, many have implicated Israel. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently condemned the killings by Israeli forces of four Palestinians—three of whom carried out terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and were killed during, or subsequent to the attacks. Ki-moon made no mention of the Israelis murdered by these terrorists. He called on Israel to investigate the incidents and “force” they used.
Force? Last time I checked, killing people as they attempt to stab you to death is not an instance of excessive force.
The world must not only condemn the horrific acts of terror; we must also condemn those responsible for inciting the violence. The Palestinian Authority is one group that we must demand be held accountable. In a recent speech on Palestinian TV, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas stated: “We bless every drop of blood that has been spilled for Jerusalem. With the help of Allah, every shaheed (martyr) will be in heaven.” He called on Palestinians to prevent Jews from entering the Temple Mount “by any means possible” and declared that Jews "have no right to defile [Al Aqsa Mosque] with their filthy feet." Days later, he declared the Oslo Accords void in a speech at the United Nations. Throughout the recent wave of terror, Fatah, Abbas’s party, has delivered leaflets in Palestinian towns praising the terrorists, and Fatah Twitter accounts have glorified the attacks. This week, a knife-wielding Gaza cleric called upon his congregants to stab Jews and “cut them into body parts.” He urged some to “restrain the victim, while others attack him with axes and butcher knives.”
The picture in Israel is grim: The country is facing mounting attacks and some Palestinian leaders are calling for a Third Intifada. Life in Israel has drastically changed over the past few weeks: Citizens stay indoors, commuters spend hours longer in their cars to take safer routes, and shops and restaurants are eerily deserted. As time goes on, more and more people know those personally affected by the violence. Nowhere is safe.
Israel is under attack and it is outrageous that the world has remained silent throughout these recent atrocities. It is time for the world to speak up.
The silence is deafening.

The Harvard Economics department has a Stanford problem. With the recent news of the departure of professor Raj Chetty ’00, yet another rising star in the department with Nobel Prize potential has decided to leave for Palo Alto. While the Harvard Economics department has long enjoyed its status at the pinnacle of American economics, alongside the departments at MIT, Princeton, the University of Chicago, and Stanford, this status is clearly in jeopardy. Three of the 12 professors given tenure since 2006 have since departed for Stanford; this number does not include other professors, such as Alvin E. Roth, who have also left in that time. Harvard simply cannot continue to lose professors to Stanford while purporting to offer a top-notch department. While the resources Harvard dedicates to its Economics department on their own are not lacking, the relative lack of resources compared to Stanford is troubling.
There are two major problems with the recent trend. First, it is imperative for the university to maintain a prominent place in economic research. Cambridge, buoyed by the prominent economists at Harvard and MIT, has long been considered the center of the economics world. When Chetty returned to Harvard in 2008, he cited “the central presence of Cambridge in the economics profession” as one of his main reasons for coming. Chetty’s departure is a clear sign of this presence shifting westward.
Further, we are particularly concerned with how the department’s apparent inability to keep up with Stanford might affect the undergraduates. With 618 concentrators in 2014, the Economics department is among the College’s largest. These concentrators deserve better than a department where professors describe morale as “not at its highest” and work in a small and outdated building that has not been renovated in decades.
As professors like Chetty leave the department, they take with them the most talented graduate students who end up teaching a large portion of the introductory classes in economics. This has the potential to create a cascading effect in Stanford’s favor. As professors leave for Palo Alto and attract talented graduate students away from Harvard, the quality of undergraduate economics teaching will inevitably fall. The size and importance of the economics department here suggests that this is a problem that must be rectified.
When Chetty was lured to Stanford, he was offered an abundance of resources that Harvard has been either unwilling or unable to provide for its professors. But all is not lost: The University should actively seek to match the salaries and perks offered by Stanford, lest it lose entirely its former dominance in the discipline. In Economics 10, we learn about supply and demand. Clearly, Harvard must do something to lure this supply of excellent professors back to Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I live in a small Quad double. I have a hallway bathroom, no common room, and a thirteen-minute walk every time I need to get to the Yard.
My friend, also a sophomore, lives in DeWolfe. His single is the size of my double. It’s right off of a spacious common room, with a private bathroom and a full-kitchen. (Not to mention air-conditioning.)
This year the room and board section of our term bills will both read $15,381. This dichotomy is representative of Harvard’s larger housing system.
The University randomizes freshmen into one of twelve Houses each spring. Rooming quality, location, and House resources are skewed—a reality made even more salient by the series of major renovations that have thus far been limited to River Houses. But Harvard stands by the system for fear of a worse one, like those practiced in the past.
Through the 1990s, students had a choice of which House they would join—initially, through a set of interviews with the House masters, and later, through a process in which students numbered their House preferences one through twelve and were accordingly placed.
But some began to complain about self-segregation among students.
“One House had a great predominance of natural-science concentrators,” Leverett House Master John Dowling described, “Another had most of the gay and lesbian students, and one had an excess of students from prep schools. There have been Houses which had large black populations relative to the College population.”
The ensuing debate led to the 1996 implementation of today’s system: total randomization. And administrators have since celebrated the consequent diversity in the Houses.
“You have to get a wider web of people connecting in the houses,” co-Master of Cabot House Rakesh Khurana told Harvard Magazine in 2013. “You don’t want students with identical interests or backgrounds just hanging out with each other.”
But the opportunity cost of randomization is a higher degree of dissatisfaction with rooming. Students are put in the Quad when they want to be by the river. And students are put in small Houses when they wanted to be in a larger House. When a friend told me on Housing Day that he had wanted the Quad but had gotten Dunster, I admittedly cringed.
Granted, most would probably agree that Harvard administrators largely got it right. The diversity in the Houses is a special component of the Harvard experience.
But there is a way to preserve a degree of students’ preferences in the housing system while maintaining this diversity.
My suggestion is that the University allow blocking groups to list their House preferences one through twelve, as under the past system. Then, much the same as the process for handpicking freshmen for each Yard dorm, House masters would handpick blocking groups with knowledge of their preferences, while ensuring diversity in each House.
The system wouldn’t be perfect. After all, no one is going to enter the process wanting my double in the Quad. It would still entail winners and losers. And the same Houses would surely gravitate to the top of most blocking groups’ lists.
However, this partial preference system would at least minimize the number of students dissatisfied with their House assignment. It wouldn’t make everybody a winner of the system, but it would make a lot more winners and lot fewer losers. There is no reason that a freshman who wants a Quad House should be placed in Adams House, provided that equal levels of diversity are maintained.
It would also improve levels of satisfaction by enfranchising students in the process to a degree. A 1994 Crimson op-ed described the lottery system as an “objectification of students” that treats students "as random objects of varying shapes, sizes and colors which must be evenly distributed among houses.”
Harvard’s housing system might seem too entrenched to change. Administrators have belabored the House system’s centrality to the college experience too many times to start playing with it.
But in reality, the Housing system that we know today is a product of change over the last thirty years. It’s not unthinkable that with the right line of innovative thinking and the communication of students’ voices that it could change again.

By 10 a.m. it was raining fiercely. I dragged myself up hill after hill, struggling to imagine a worse scenario for my second day on the Appalachian Trail. Around noon the torrential downpour broke for a brief moment, and I sat down on a damp log to rest my aching shoulders, which were responsible for carrying the 30-odd pounds of backpack, food, and supplies that were currently my home. Sitting in silence, watching the rainwater swell and pool on the thick leaves around me, the first insidious thought snuck into my brain and took root. I was miserable, the thought wheezed, I should go home. And it never quite left. Two months later, when my dog’s cancer was close to consuming him, I called it quits and got on the next flight to Boston.
But that’s depressing, so let’s rewind a bit.
On the eighth day of my journey, I became friends with Rose. We were both trying to stay at a motel for a night, and I, having risen early, had gotten the last room. On the shuttle back from a grocery store she cornered me in my seat and asked politely if she could pay for half the room so we could split it for the night. I was a little annoyed with her for giving me the trail name Whiz Kid the previous night, which had stuck, and I was loath to give up my night of watching TV and eating pizza in my underwear. But I begrudgingly agreed, and even told her to keep her money.
Of course, there was a happy ending. We stayed up late (and by late I mean 11 p.m., which is very late for hikers) and got to know each other over a few beers. We truthfully had very little in common, one of us being a Californian hippy and the other a Massachusetts prepster. I was still a little grumpy about being denied my private feast, so I didn’t really hold anything back. I talked openly about my now-long distance relationship, complained about school and family, and shamelessly told my admittedly dumb jokes and stories. She did the same, and by the end of the night we were hiking partners.
I read 15 books in e-format on my phone over the course of my journey, which proved to be welcome distractions from the miles and miles between myself and my friends, family, and dog. But while the literary world helped, I doubt I would have lasted more than two weeks out there if I had reluctantly given half my hotel room to a near-stranger for a night.
Weeks after our motel meeting, lounging on a lawn chair at a hostel on a zero-day (during which one hikes zero miles), another hiker commented on how it was nice that Rose and I had met and gotten together on the trail. “Oh, we’re not like, together,” I quickly corrected. “I’ve got a girlfriend back home. And Rose has a boyfriend.”
“Oh,” he shrugged. “Sorry. I thought you had found someone out here.”
I know what he meant, but I don’t think those two are mutually exclusive.
On the last night of my trip, our small gang of hikers ate out at a Chinese restaurant and then fit six people into a hotel room with two beds. At 2 in the morning, I rolled out of the bed that Rose and I were sharing, stomach churning. As a fitting punishment for deciding to abandon it, I had been cursed with food poisoning, and gradually expelled the entire contents of my gut into the toilet, covering myself in tiny hotel towels and shivering through the night.
The next morning, I said goodbye to everyone. Rose was last. We looked at each other a little awkwardly, and then she pulled me in for a hug. I realized that this was the first time this had ever happened. It was probably a terrible first hug. I smelled like shit, which is a term used literally after a night of frightening gastrointestinal distress. Still, hikers are used to adverse nasal conditions, and we held it a little longer.
As we pulled away, I realized that this might be our last hug as well. I hadn’t really dealt with the reality that I might not ever see someone again in my life before, and it was less shocking than anticipated. I think, in part, this was because the temporary nature of our relationship undercut our entire time together.
The conduct is loose on the trail, and people speak their minds and say fuck off to anyone who doesn’t get them. I could have told Rose to fuck off and find her own room, and then comfortably never have seen her again. And weeks later, despite the firm friendship we had built, I never felt afraid to speak exactly what was on my mind.
I think this was more than familiarity. Most people are there to hike, and there’s no pressure to make friends or shame in not being popular. It’s hard to be an outcast in a society full of them, so people are who they are, even if that person is a little rough around the edges.
In the real world, I snip and trim and tailor the rough edges off of each sentence, because there’s a time and a place for everything. Sometimes I want to be honest with the people I love, but if honesty means that they retreat and become less important parts of my life, I would rather I remain silent and hold onto them. This is how the real world works, and it’s an important part of what keeps us civil and together.
In truth, I hated most of the people I met on the trail. Many of the conversations left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. But it makes a stark contrast to my loose grasp of names and faces out here in the real world, where it takes six run-ins in the d-hall to progress a person past the “tall dude with brown hair” stage of identification. The people on the trail I met may have been eccentric, but they’re anything but forgettable. Honestly, who could forget the man who was hiking the trail because his wife sued him for child support and he needed a place to hide?
But the people who I did grow to love on the trail are people I still feel close to today. I think, or maybe hope, that if Ramblin’ Rose, Kenny, Squirrel, White Rabbit, and the Whiz Kid met tomorrow at a shelter, nothing would have changed. Despite the stretch of time that lies between my path last crossing theirs, I like to think that the fundamental level upon which we became friends would make the distance meaningless.
Then again, it turns out that wasn’t Rose’s and my last hug. Twice now her rambling path has crossed over Boston, and we’ve taken a walk through its streets together. And while it’s elating to see her again, it’s also distinctly different. Each conversation, while good by any standard, leaves me with the unsettling sensation that if we had met within the backdrop of a city we would not have become friends.
I write this down because I find myself beginning to forget things about the trail that I did not record on my blog. And the things I didn’t write because I felt ashamed of them—about burgeoning friendship, about doubts and sadness, and even about having too many beers with strangers on the trail before drunkenly stumbling through a hailstorm—those are the things that actually matter. Sometimes it’s hard to be honest in the real world, but I suspect the times that people stop worrying about wrong impressions will be the ones worth remembering.

My arms flail around in desperation, my legs kick with despair, and I join in with the exaggerated movements occurring everywhere around me. Oh yeah, I’m getting into it. And I’m in the middle of the Science Center Plaza.
Then, all of a sudden, a friend ruins my groove. He creeps up on me, all ninja-like, and sinisterly asks, “What the hell are you doing?” I ignore him but want to say, “Obviously, I’m in a Zumba class.” Heat crawls up my neck as I see more friends walking by me, laughing in utter confusion. I try to ignore the grim reality that my peers will be talking about the 6’2’’ Asian dude with an ostentatious green polo sweater who looks like an uncoordinated buffoon—but I fail. After 15 minutes of pure, unadulterated self-humiliation, I make the executive decision to stop and sit next to Italian tourists who were previously gawking at me.
The following half hour is, in one word, brutal. I look at the group having an absolute blast—there are no less than 30 sweaty people dancing away stress, calories, and fat. There appear to be a few female undergraduate students, some graduate students, and a handful of dancers who look older than my grandparents, all coming together in a busy public space to take part in a Zumba class. I have a yearning to jump back into the lines of dancers, but at the same time, I feel much more comfortable in my new front row seat.
When the session ends—finally—I approach several members of the motley crew with questions:
“How do you feel knowing that tourists and students are constantly Snapchatting you?”
Awkward grandpa: “I guess I’m hot shit now.”
Undergraduate female student: “It’s annoying, but then again, kids snapchat everything nowadays.”
“What do you think about holding the weekly Zumba sessions in front of the Science Center?”
Adorable kindergarten-aged tourist: “So cool. This is so cool.”
Female graduate student: “It’s convenient and fun. You just have to forget where you are and that people are watching you. The wind is great and the vibe is even better. It’s always fun to dance outside.”
My advice? Outdoor Zumba is not for everyone, but just try it. Live life unafraid to be embarrassed. To be honest, I will never go out to a session again, but this experience will remain in my top 10 most memorable moments of freshman fall.
And, no, I am not a loser.

The typical packs of wandering students are out again on a Friday night. They’re shouting joyfully, crossing paths, calling out plans, and marching on, full of hope and the right amount of drinks. Tonight, there is a visible purpose in the flow of people. They’re migrating towards the colored lights and thumping bass line that beckon from the Science Center Plaza. My group follows through the gates.
Yesterday, I sat across from Avni Nahar ’17 and Cecilia Laguarda ’17 on the eve of the much hyped [BLANK] Party to learn more about the initiative. They were two of the many organizers who put on the free, inclusive campus party at which I find myself this Friday night. It was clear from our conversation that throwing an open party takes work. The team had been working closely with a “very supportive administration” since shopping week to acquire the space, funding, HUPD involvement, and more. “We want this party to be whatever students want it to be,” Nahar says.
So why the [BLANK]? “It’s important to us that women get to be throwing the party, but it’s not important that you are affiliated with any of our organizations,” Laguarda says. “Putting any of the organization’s names in the party wasn’t really the idea.”
Nahar echoed the sentiment. “It’s important that we as women have ownership over a social space, and extend that space to anyone who chooses to be a part of it, regardless of anything else,” she says.
My group is greeted by Nahar at the opening of the white tent. I drag my two male friends visiting from North Carolina with me into the crowd, where the giddy vibe is reminiscent of the dance floor at prom night. Kid from Orgo section? Dance with me. Senior teammate? Dance with me. Girl I just met? Dance with me. I think back to my conversation yesterday. “Everyone is welcome. We want everyone to feel like it is their party, and their space to enjoy for the night,” Laguarda had explained.
What do events like the [BLANK] Party
mean for future weekend nights, future social
spaces, future social shifts? “You know, it’s
Harvard, things take a long time to change. But
I think the conversations, and the number of people who have been talking about it, [have] been really encouraging to see,” Laguarda says. Nahar agreed, thinking back to the differences she’s noticed over the years. “I think when I came here as a freshman, there was really not that much critical thinking happening about social spaces. The social scene was just the norm, and not really something to be discussed further.”
Amidst the sweat and dancing, I notice something happening around me. Everyone out tonight has the same goal in mind. To see people we know. To meet others we don’t. To move, uninhibited, to music we love. To feel safe and at ease, not judged or questioned. That’s all we need. A blank slate with the simple things.
The sharp October air tonight feels like youth and change. Yesterday, Nahar had said she was hopeful for what tonight could mean for the future. “I think in the planning of this event, we always hoped that if everything goes well, this is something that can become a recurring part of the Harvard social scene.”

I made plans to meet FM Chair (and local celebrity) Bailey M. Trela outside of Annenberg for an early dinner in the Queen’s Head Pub. While I’m shocked to see that Bailey actually showed up—and on time, no less—it’s no surprise that Bailey is already up to his usual shenanigans. Perched on a kid’s contraption better suited for a playground than Harvard’s campus, Bailey’s body language screams, “I own this block.” I worry about the number of local toddlers and wide-eyed tourist-children Bailey must have scared away to claim his throne. And, more importantly, is FM legally culpable for Bailey’s actions? I consider reaching out to the Crimson’s legal team, but in the meantime, I might as well enjoy some wings.
Hungry as ever, Bailey and I descend the stairs towards the Queen’s Head Pub. We reach a sign that tells us that we have come through the wrong entrance. We must exit the building and enter anew. It’s O.K. Just a minor snafu in what is sure to be a glorious evening.
For those who don’t know, Wednesday at the Queen’s Head Pub is wing night. Twenty-five-cent wing night. For example, four wings is a dollar. Eleven wings is $2.75. Twenty wings is 5 dollars. Thirty-five wings is 35 times .25, which I’m having trouble doing right now. Five times five is 25, carry the two.
Anyways, we get to the bar. Big Cub Bailey orders first: 10 hot, 10 BBQ. Twenty wings? A little ambitious, I think. I rock 15 instead. Five Teriyaki, five BBQ, five hot. A veteran play. We consider a side-order of mozzarella sticks, but at $5.75 it’s hard to justify a few meager mozzarella sticks over 24 more wings. The opportunity cost is just too damn high.
When I take out my Harvard ID to pay, Bailey chuckles. He doesn’t realize that you can pay with Board Plus. He follows my lead. Obviously, he has never been here before. I wonder where else on campus has he yet to visit? Does he know about the MAC? OCS? The Science Center? I digress. After paying for his wings, Bailey has $55 of Board Plus remaining, or 220 wings. I have $46 left, or 184 wings. We may be in for a long night ahead.
The wings keep flying in. The rest of the chicken’s body must have been holding them back. Anticipating the mess to come, I grab a stack of napkins and give Bailey half. He starts lining up his napkins side-by-side. Equally confused and intrigued, I follow suit. It turns out he has four, and I have six. Was this the point of his napkin formation, to show I gave him less than half? Have I wronged/cheated/dishonored him?
I offer him one of my napkins, but he refuses it. Slightly offended, I suspect he thinks I will be the more messy eater. I begin with a teriyaki wing, and the sauce is just right. I move on next to a hot wing, and follow the pattern: teriyaki, hot, BBQ. After every few wings I wipe my fingers with one of my six napkins. Bailey does no such thing. Mid-way through the meal, I nearly lose my appetite to the sight of his sauce-drenched fingers. I respect his environmentally-friendly method, but my stomach does not concur.
Anyways, aside from the meal itself (which was great), I learned that my pal Bailey is quite the conversationalist. We reminisced about some old FM legends, Libby and Petey. Letey, or Pibby. Pibby, or Letey. I’m not sure which will stick. I learned about his creative writing work, about his family, and how he just got a letter with $48 in it. I wonder what would physically happen if we split those dollars not in currency, but in 192 wings.
As our meal is winding down and just a few wings still have meat on them, Bailey points out that he is crying. There is a literal tear sliding ever-so-slowly down his right cheek. His hands, saucy as ever, are in no condition to touch his face, and he refuses my assistance. I look down at his plate—Bailey has recently only consumed BBQ. A tear would have made sense in the days of hot wings, but now, why? Maybe he is sad that our dinner is coming to an end. More likely, he is so stuffed that he is struggling to finish his plate. He confirms my suspicion. “Only two left,” he says. I point out there are three distinct wings on his plate. The tear continues.

Before Powerpoint and Keynote appropriated the term “slide” to the flashy, digital rectangles that we dread in Monday morning lecture, slides were actual panes made out of plastic and glass. Professors would insert them into a slide projector and give their lectures.
Go figure.
One can imagine that two or three lectures a week with dozens of slides for each lecture would create a vast number of these small plastic rectangles. This summer, haphazard boxes full of slides arrived and were catalogued by interns Alona R. Bach ‘16 and Melissa C. Rodman ’18, an active Crimson news and arts writer, at the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. CHSI, located in the Science Center and curated by Dr. Sara Schechner, contains over 20,000 objects, including old lecture slides. Eventually, most the 974 newly arrived and jumbled slides were attributed to professor Eugene G. Rochow. The slides not only opened a window to learning chemistry in the mid‐1900s, but also revealed a dynamic, funny, and bold professor.
Before joining the Harvard faculty in 1948, Rochow was a key member of the team at General Electric who worked with silicones, and especially stick‐resistant plastics. One of his primary contributions was the advancement of water repellent windshields, especially airplane windshields. He also developed non‐adhesive silicone used in the tubing for blood transfusions. This non‐adhesive tubing allowed transfusions to be more efficient and useful.
At Harvard, Rochow taught Chemistry 1. In 1961, in an article recommending courses, The Crimson referred to his class as “Black Magic 1” and described it as the “most engaging show since Merlin.” The entertainment factor and the dynamic of his class can be further explained by two slides, both picturing cut‐out Valentine’s Day hearts, with the following messages: 1. “The Chemistry of Explosions,” 2. “Professor Rochow, HAPPY VALENTINE’S DAY! ‐‐ To a man who, more than any other, has sent many a heart into skipping a beat and fluttering for days. With appreciation, the Cliffe Contingent.”
But Rochow was more than an entertaining professor of chemistry. He was vocal about political matters with regard to the Cold War and incorporated current events into his lectures. In several Crimson articles, Rochow expressed his belief that space exploration was an important alternative to direct war with the Soviet Union. In the same article, he was also vocal about his desire that the UN have more centralized power and uphold stricter laws relating to Atomic testing. As a chemist, he lectured and spoke about his concerns regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and scientists’ ability to use them without ever testing them. The nuclear arms race was an important aspect of the Cold War, which lasted for the entirety of Rochow’s tenure as a professor at Harvard. He was an expert on the topic, and the slides reveal that he included current events like the success of Enterprise, the first U.S. aircraft carrier powered by nuclear power, as well as explanations of “Little Boy” and “Fat Man,” which were the bombs used in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
Rochow’s political statements were not limited to the global competition in the Cold War. In 1952, amidst the U.S. Steelworkers’ strike, Rochow made 12 pounds of actual steel from the front of his class. As the molten lava flowed from the lectern Rochow said, “somebody has to do it” in reference to the Steelworkers’ Strike. Even in the current age of students’ who are often jaded by flashy demonstrations, producing molten steel at the front of the classroom would be fairly remarkable.
In a lecture published by the Journal of Chemical Education in 1985, Rochow discusses the professors who were influential in his life. He mentions a professor Dennis who taught by demonstration and a professor Stock for whom he worked as a personal assistant. The point of this lecture was to advise students to make good choices, to choose their fields, their mentors, and their interests wisely.
Information regarding slides and a little more provided by Alona R. Bach ‘16 and Melissa C. Rodman ‘18, interns at the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments through the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program.

Admit it. You wish you were as cool as your professors. You spend lecture trying to emulate their mannerisms and habits. But while you may not be able to pull off a dress as well as English professor Stephen L. Burt ’94, sharing his taste in music is a start. Below, FM gets the lowdown on what a few professors are singing in the shower these days...
Andrew G. Clarke, Professor of Music:
“Do Re Mi” from “The Sound of Music”“It’s embarrassing, but as a music professor, I’ve never actually seen ‘The Sound of Music’ all the way through. My 6-year-old daughter currently sees herself as a mini Julie Andrews, so we’ve been having fun with this song at dinner time.”
“Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers“God, I love this song. I listen to it in the car home from work to chill out.”
“Didn’t It Rain” by Mahalia Jackson“This song is like a narcotic. If I listen to it, I can’t sit still. This piece has so much momen- tum, resiliency, and joy. It leaves me breathless.”
“Long Time Traveller” by The Wailin’ Jennys“I love bluegrass and American folk music, and this song speaks to a lot of the music that my grandparents loved. Leisurely, I prefer not to listen to music I’m working on for work. It’s nice to listen to music and not have to think about it or analyze or critique it.”
“Frog’s Eye” by Evan Ziporyn“I set my alarm to this. It gets me out of my morning fog. It’s a classical and also modern contemporary work by a composer working at MIT.”
Daniel T. Gilbert, Professor of Psychology:
“Cardboard Castles” by Dengue Fever“I love this Cambodian psychedelic rock group because they just don’t sound like anyone else.”
“For Bunita Marcus” by Morton Feldman“A 75 minute long solo piano piece with more silence than notes, but still, it will take you to another world if you let it.”
“Sometimes I Sit and Think, and SometimesI Just Sit” by Courtney Barnett
“Best new artist of 2015, so far. This Aussie rocker is strange in all the right ways.”
“Angels” by Joe Henry“Madonna’s brother-in-law was always far more talented than she was. Brilliant singer-songwriter-producer whose lyrics rival [Bob] Dylan’s. How can he not be more famous?”
“Paranoid Android” by Brad Mehldau“Only Mehldau could pull off a jazz version of a Radiohead classic.”
Stephen L. Burt ’94, Professor of English
“Half Heart Necklace” by Allo Darlin’“Allo Darlin’ is the greatest present day pop indie band.”
“Walking Wounded” by Everything but the Girl“Pop electronica is a great genre right now, and it all comes from this album.”
“The Real Sheila” by Game Theory“This song was just reissued after it was unavailable for a long time. Game Theory is my favorite American band, and I’ve written about them at excruciating length.”
“(Us and All) Our Friends Are So Messed Up” by The Pagans“This song signifies the end of punk rock, and I’m a big Ohio punk rock fan.”
“String Quartet,” composed by Maurice Ravel“This piece is beautiful and has pop virtues. You never know where it’s going next. It doesn’t sound like elevator music. Indie pop is the thing I care about the most, but I try to care about other kinds of music: composed, outside of developed world, and loud annoying music.”

A $70,000 per year stipend for three years, intimate weekly dinners with the upper crust of academia, and no teaching or publishing requirements.
Three things sure to make a newly-minted Ph.D. drool. And while this may sound like post-doctoral paradise, it’s a reality for 42 junior fellows in Harvard’s Society of Fellows.
Though at it’s most basic level the Society of Fellows is like any other post-doctoral fellowship (Princeton, Michigan, and Columbia have similar programs of the same name), it’s unique in its generosity and lack of requirements.
Forced to choose from about 400 nominees at the top of their respective Ph.D. programs, the Society has an admit rate roughly comparable to the College’s. In an anemic academic job market, being a junior fellow offers some measure of security for those aspiring to land a tenure track position at a top university. Indeed, many choose the fellowship over tenure track job offers from other universities. In short, it’s a safe bet for professional success.
LOFTY ORIGINS
If the Society of Fellows seems like a vestige of Old Harvard, that’s because, in many ways, it is. Founded in 1933 almost entirely on the initiative of University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, the Fellowship is modeled on Cambridge University’s Prize Fellowship.
The Society was also, at its outset, almost entirely funded by Lowell. After the Rockefeller Foundation declined to offer a sponsorship, Lowell stepped up and, as he frequently told friends, poured “every penny” he had into creating a $1 million endowed fund for the Society in memory of his late wife, Anna Parker Lowell.
Lowell’s intent was to create an alternative academic capstone to the Ph.D., a program that Lowell felt was too specialized. Lowell, who famously valued men “who know a little of everything and something well,” wanted to staff the Society with an academically diverse group of scholars. The Society, to the surprise of few, did not replace the Ph.D., and today sits at the top of the heap of post-doctoral programs..
Enshrined in the founding of the Society, in addition to the aforementioned weekly dinner and twice-weekly lunches amongst the junior fellows, was an unconventional selection process still used today.
Aspiring fellows must be nominated by a Ph.D. adviser to apply. Though any academic institution can send in nominations, the Society actively solicits nominations from a limited number of programs. The senior fellows, today a group of 16 voting members (one of whom is on leave) and three ex-officio members (University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ‘76, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith), review the nominees and bring about 40 of them in for interviews with all of the voting senior fellows.
Peter L. McMurray ’05, a first-year Junior Fellow doing research in Musicology and Sound Studies, was rejected from the Society before earning a place this year.
The Senior Fellows surround the interviewee in a horseshoe and embark on what McMurray calls a “combination of absolute hot seat and this wonderful conversation with really engaging people who know a lot about everything.”
Those lucky enough to be chosen from the interview pool embark on three years of fully-funded unstructured scholarship, following in the footsteps of Noam Chomsky, B.F. Skinner, Daniel Ellsberg ’52, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. ’38, as well as scores of tenured professors at the top universities in the country.
BEWILDERING AND EXCITING
With three years of complete academic freedom, many Fellows take time not just for research and publishing, but also to plumb the depths of a new discipline or hone an old talent.
Junior fellow Rowan Dorin ’07, for instance, is working on a book on the idea of banishment throughout European history. In his spare time, however, he’s re-teaching himself the piano.
McMurray is taking advantage of his full access to Harvard resources and classes. He only had time to meet briefly before an Arabic class that he’s taking from the College. Though he already readily uses three to five languages for his daily research, at this point, when he encounters a new language he “can sort of learn to get through things if [I] absolutely need to.”
Used to the teaching requirements of his graduate program, McMurray is shocked at how much time has freed up during his Fellowship.
“That freedom is both bewildering and really exciting,” McMurray says.
The Society of Fellows makes only three claims on their junior fellows’ time, and they are all meals. Junior fellows are expected to show up at two junior fellow lunches a week and one dinner, a formal affair attended by both junior and senior Fellows.
The dinners are lavish Monday-night banquets in a private Eliot House Dining Hall used predominantly for the Society. According to several junior fellows, the combination of scintillating conversation, what McMurray called “copious amounts” of wine, and a sumptuous meal (complete with chocolate and cheese courses) means that Monday-night dinners can last from six to seven hours, the most resolute conversationalists sometimes leaving as late as one in the morning. According to McMurray, conversation runs the gamut from celebrity gossip to nuclear physics.
These weekly dinners can turbocharge a young academic’s professional network. Although many of the junior fellows would undoubtedly have successful careers even if they weren’t fellows, a striking number of junior fellows do become tenured faculty, many of them at Harvard.
FOR WHO’S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW?
While McMurray acknowledges that he still doesn’t know much about the Society (his three-year term just started this past July), he remembers he was surprised to find the society populated by “a lot of people who look like me.”
Many junior fellows say that the makeup of their program is plagued by the same lack of diversity that exists on a larger scale in academia. Although it has at least one member, Isaiah Andrews, who identifies as black, Andrews believes that he is the only black Fellow, Junior or Senior, “unless there is a [black] junior fellow who is technically still enrolled and not coming to things.”
According to Program Administrator Kelly R. Katz, who declined to comment on the racial background of the junior fellows, the Society does not keep official statistics on the racial makeup of the junior fellows. Further, the listing of junior fellows on the Society’s web page shows that an Oxbridge or Ivy League degree of some sort is practically a requirement.
Three of this year’s junior fellows, Dorin, Kevin Holden ‘05, and Daniel Williams ‘06, were undergraduates at Harvard at the same time and all took a Masters of Philosophy at Cambridge.
All three were members of the Signet Society, which occupies a pale yellow house on Mount Auburn Street right next door to one of the Society’s office buildings.
According to third-year junior fellow Ya-Wen Lei, among others, having some sort of Harvard connection is the norm for a junior fellow.
“Many of the junior fellows have spent 10 years at Harvard as undergrads and Ph.D. students, and post-docs and also as faculty members,” Lei says. “Very few people don’t have that kind of [Harvard] connection and I think I’m one of the few that doesn’t.”
While junior fellows note that there is representation amongst East Asians and South Asians, the Society is still largely white. Senior fellows attribute these imbalances to a number of factors.
On the question of racial representation, senior fellows noted that the Society is limited by the demographics of who graduates from a Ph.D. program. Post-doctoral programs see an applicant pool that has already passed through a number of bottlenecks (resource inequity in primary and secondary education, college admissions, graduate school admissions, etc.) that many believe contribute to minority underrepresentation.
Some members of the Society believe the nomination process inherently allows for unconscious racial bias, as individual advisors subjectively choose who to nominate from their program.
“Essentially because who advisers decide to recommend has a lot to do with their judgments of people, …it seems plausible that that might be an area where there’s particularly large room for bias,” Andrews says.
Junior and Senior Fellows also suggest that the system of nomination, rather than application, keeps the field of fellows mostly limited to those who have attended Oxbridge and Ivy League institutions. While technically nominees may come from any University, just a select few are actively encouraged to submit names and, some say, that group is treated preferentially—perhaps unconsciously so—during the selection process.
Sen says that in order to address the racial imbalance, the society should consider soliciting nominations from a wider group of programs.
“Of course [the selections] are skewed,” says senior fellow Andrew Strominger ’77 of the ubiquitous Harvard and Oxbridge connections amongst Junior Fellows. “I mean, everyone has biases in their selection procedure... Of course, we strive to minimize the amount by which things are skewed.”
Strominger mentioned that “there has been some discussion” about disqualifying Harvard graduate students from winning the fellowship—a practice that Princeton’s Society of Fellows has adopted. The senior fellows ultimately decided they didn’t want to miss out on talented candidates from Harvard graduate schools.
According to Dorin, the Harvard skew is natural when senior fellows have to look through so many applications.
“When you’re trying to choose people on the very speculative grounds of who is doing the most promising and innovative work, when anybody who’s being nominated is doing innovative and exciting and promising work, having some point of reference and having a connection obviously helps,” Dorin says.
Though there have been efforts to solicit nominations from a broader range of schools, the fact that each candidate’s nomination materials must be read by two senior fellows creates a cap on the number of nominations the Society can physically process. The Society already sends out 4,000 nomination solicitations per year, and Sen, by his own estimates, spends 12 to 14 hours every week reviewing nominations when they start coming in.
And there are certain ways in which the Society is incredibly diverse. Though most junior fellows hold a doctorate from an American university, senior fellow Elaine Scarry estimates that about half of the fellows were born in a foreign country.
AN ACADEMIC KINGMAKER
Today’s junior fellows are tomorrow’s academic elite. One need only Google a few of the former fellows to find that they occupy some of the top academic positions in the country. Four of the nine fellows at the Society between 1986 and 1989, to take a particularly successful term, are now tenured Harvard professors.
The world of post-doctoral fellowships is, understandably, far less scrutinized than the soul-crushing, multi-million-dollar industry that is undergraduate admissions. Indeed, in the constant media theatrics around Harvard, the Society has done exceedingly well at staying out of the spotlight. Still, it is an organization with a long history at Harvard and an important impact on campus culture.
Post-docs, after all, become full faculty. Though the governance of the modern university does often rest with non-academic administrators, faculty still exercise a remarkable degree of control over every aspect of university life. The selection of today’s senior fellows will to a large extent determine the academic landscape for decades to come. Perhaps, in between the cheese course and the after-dinner drinks, it’s worth thinking about whether the selection process that President Lowell, no lover of diversity, devised back in 1933 is still well-equipped for the modern academy.

It’s rush hour on the Red Line, and space is at a premium. A woman casts a sideways glance at us and rises somewhat resentfully from her seat to move further down the packed subway car. Other passengers frown. It’s loud so we try talking loud, and then louder still. The train’s ringing and rumbling form the soundtrack to our interview.
We are on the T with Ian D. Reynolds, an MIT junior who knows a lot more about the MBTA (and, for that matter, engineering, CS, soldering, Arduino, and math) than either of us. Reynolds can tell you the history of the Orange Line (“an interesting case study in community activism,” he says), the pros and cons of the newly redesigned MBTA map, and the nuanced aesthetics of Porter Square (“gritty enough to exhibit character" but not, like New York, “gritty enough to be disgusting”). He can also show you the location of every train on the network of underground tunnels in real time, on a giant LED map on the wall of his bedroom.
“I thought it was a cool tribute to something that I really care about and really enjoy studying, and I thought it would make my room a little more interesting too,” Reynolds says.
Reynold’s twisting 29 and a half-foot map of colored LEDs has netted him job offers, curious visitors, and an article in The Boston Globe, but it sprang out of humble beginnings. “I wanted to get experience with microcontroller programming and engineering involved in making a map,” he says.
Though construction only took a week—and, he tells us, “wasn’t that difficult”—the idea has been in the making for about a year. Or, according to some family members, a bit longer. “My mom thinks it’s really funny,” Reynolds tells us, “like, ‘Oh, you were so interested in trains when you were younger,’ but I’m not sure I really see the connection between that and why I’ve taken an interest in this now. But maybe it’s buried somewhere.”
Reynolds’ interest resonated with a larger audience on Reddit—specifically, the forum “T Therapy Thursdays,” mainly home to traveler posts about spitting incidents and baby misfortunes. After posting there, Reynolds was discovered by various news outlets and public transportation experts, 15 minutes of fame he didn’t quite expect.
In the midst of our conversation, we disembark at the Harvard Square T stop in hopes of finding a little more elbow room and a little less noise; the latter proves elusive. As we chat, trains roar past us every so often, inserting segments of impenetrable white noise into the interview. Commuters hurry past, barely glancing at the tangle of colored lines on the wall behind Reynolds.
“It’s got a lot of quirks and interesting features and definitely looks like it’s not a planned system; it’s very haphazardly appeared over time,” he says. Unplanned, but, says Reynolds, critically important to the city’s functioning.
“Whether a society invests in public transportation says a lot about how much they care about society’s poorest members, and keeping the public clean and safe,” Reynolds says. He talks about how last year’s record-breaking snow brought the MBTA, and with it, the city, to a screeching halt. “With the snowstorm last winter you can see that when the T doesn’t work, Boston, as a whole, doesn’t work,” Reynolds says. “Some people say, ‘Oh, I don’t use the T,’ but the person serving your coffee might use the T.”
“The more people talk about the T, the better, because it affects all of us,” he says.
As for the future? “There’s a lot of stuff I want to do on the software side to make it run a little bit more efficiently,” Reynolds says, mentioning the possible addition of markers like congestion and income. “Maybe visualize a little more data.”
For now, Reynold’s Central Square-bound train pulls out of the station, and somewhere an LED bulb clicks to register his progress home.

W.E.B. DuBois’s face greets me as soon as I step off the elevator and into the Hutchins Center. His mural on the wall is my first indication of the work that happens here, and I’m instantly aware that I’m stepping into a very special space. The W.E.B. DuBois Research Institute is the “anchor” of the Hutchins Center, according to Executive Director Abby Wolf, and DuBois’s perceptive and trailblazing spirit lives on in the aims of this place.
The Hutchins Center is an institution dedicated to researching the culture and history of Africans worldwide, essentially a specialized organization designed to explore every nook and cranny of this one area of study. From hip-hop to heritage, gallery tours to guest speakers, the Hutchins Center leaves nothing out of the equation.
I’m greeted at the front desk by a woman who seems taken aback when I ask if I can “explore” to “get a feel for the place.” She gives me a polite and confused “Not usually?” and I soon realize I’m in the administrative offices of the Hutchins Center, just one part of the institute that’s spread out across so many different vessels of Harvard life.
The Hutchins Center encompasses a wide variety of venues and ways of experiencing African and African-American culture. The Hiphop Archive and Research Institute, the Afro-Latin American Research Institute, and the Image of the Black Archive and Library all fall under the Hutchins Center’s wide umbrella. The center curates art galleries, gives weekly tours, keeps up research in an important and relevant field of study, puts out two different publications, juggles multiple revolving projects, and more.
As I poke around the offices, I’m struck mostly by the art on the walls—the Hutchins Center runs two separate art galleries, but the art on the walls of their administrative wing is a display in itself. I marvel at a particular set of pieces and Wolf, showing me around, notes that they are created by artist Suesan Stovall. Multimedia focused with many layers, Stovall’s work features everything from newspaper clippings to mismatched buttons to mini tin spoons. The artistic style is unique and fresh, an impression I get in every component of the Hutchins Center. It’s certainly a style they’re proud of. “I want that in my dorm!” I say, and we both laugh.
One of the most unique projects of the Hutchins Center, and perhaps the most relevant to youth culture, is the Hiphop Archive and Research Institute, which features colorful Nike sneakers, gold chains, spray-paint cans, and a Notorious B.I.G. figurine. Aside from its impressive collection of gear, the Hiphop Archive is an exciting and special learning, creating, and researching space unique in its focus topic and the leader in its field of research.
I’m disappointed that I can’t poke around the Hiphop Archive without an appointment, but everything I gather from material online and outsider opinions tells me that I’ve got to make the trip back soon. The graffiti-style writing on the walls, which boast in loud print “Build. Respect. Represent,” the incredible collection of interesting and relevant artifacts, the fresh and exciting feel of the place as a whole—it’s a contemporary student’s dream. It probably won’t look half bad on Instagram either.
Wolf notes casually, with a slight hint of pride, that the Hiphop Archive has even hosted some Hiphop artists. Her offhandedness leads me to believe this can’t be anyone major, yet she follows up by name-dropping J.Cole and Chance the Rapper, who have both visited the Hiphop Archive. Wolf laughs as I get excited (“I love J.Cole!”) and says that “they don’t mean as much to me as they do to you.”

If you need to tune up a car in Harvard Yard, Amanda M. Graves is your gal.
Graves started her career as an auto mechanic. Upon leaving the auto shop, she joined the military and traveled the world doing counter-drug and migrant operations for the United States Coast Guard. Six years later, she moved to Australia to enter the music industry. Not one to sit still, Graves then returned to America to work for music promotion company Live Nation, managing acts like deathcore group Suicide Silence and metalcore band Memphis Mayfire.
Eventually, though, Graves elected to hit the books: The music industry “was really fun, but I didn’t see a sustainable future in it, so I decided to go back to school,” she says. She began taking classes at the University of Phoenix, a for-profit school that accepts adult and distance learners.
However, as the University of Phoenix faced degree mill accusations following a series of scandals, Graves began to have second thoughts about her choice of school. In pursuit of a greater challenge and a more reputable degree, she started researching different colleges, but found limited options for nontraditional applicants. “I actually started looking at Harvard kind of jokingly. I was like, ‘Yeah, okay, that’s not going to happen,’” Graves admits.
Then she discovered the Harvard Extension School.
At first, she took a single online course: the notoriously difficult Expository Writing, a requirement for undergraduate degree candidates at both Harvard College and the Extension School. “I thought, ‘There’s no way I’m going to pass this class.’ And then I passed it.”
Elated by her success, Graves moved to Cambridge over the summer, finished several required courses, and enrolled as a candidate for a Bachelor of Liberal Arts, the Extension School’s take on an undergraduate degree.
Compared to the average College student, Graves’s story is unconventional. She has held down long-term full-time jobs. She lives in her own apartment, quite a ways from Harvard Yard. It’s been awhile since she took the SAT.
At the Extension School, on the other hand, Graves’s story is par for the course. In fact, the School is characterized by its inclusion of students like Graves: a diverse mix of high school students and Ph.D. hopefuls, hobbyists and degree seekers, teenagers and retirees. These students tread the Harvard campus and take Harvard classes, but despite their ubiquity, many of their peers are unaware that they exist.
While they are educated here, a sense of belonging can remain elusive.
The Extension’s School’s first priority has been accessibility since 1835, when wealthy Harvard alumnus John Lowell Jr. died and willed $250,000 toward “the maintenance and support of Public Lectures to be delivered in said Boston upon philosophy, natural history, and the arts and sciences … for the promotion of the moral and intellectual and physical instruction or education of the citizens of the said city of Boston.”
Over subsequent decades, these “Public Lectures” grew in range and popularity, and in 1910 they fell under the care of Harvard University. Those lectures have since become the Extension School, a department that has educated roughly half a million students from around the world.
Since its inception, the Extension School has strived to make itself available to every student who expresses interest. “It was an access mission and a community outreach mission from the very beginning,” says Huntington D. Lambert, dean of Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
In line with that mission, though in stark contrast to Harvard’s otherwise selective admissions process, Extension enrollment is completely open to the public. It is also more affordable than a typical Harvard education, ranging from $800 to $2,400 per course.
Lowell’s original concept, Lambert says, “was that Harvard and other leading faculties would make their courses available to the common women and men of Boston for the price of no more than the cost of two bushels of wheat.” While the school no longer interprets that restriction literally, it still respects the ideal. “We tend to have more similar tuition to Massachusetts and state tuition than to Harvard.”
But the Extension School strives to make itself accessible in more ways than one: Since 1996, it has embraced web-based education, an area that many other institutions are exploring only sluggishly.
Dr. Paul G. Bamberg, a senior mathematics lecturer at Harvard, was first inspired to make a class available online when he received an email from an American living in Copenhagen, who wrote, “I want to get into a Ph.D. program in economics. As far as I can tell, this is the only appropriate math course with open enrollment anywhere in the world, and it seems unfair that you have to live in Cambridge to take it.”
Stories like this one have encouraged many professors to bring their courses online as well. In the 2013-2014 school year, 14,351 students from 91 countries—54 percent of the school’s total enrollment—paid tuition for 271 Extension courses that were hosted either partially or entirely online.
Lambert contends that increasing the online arm of the Extension School helps the College at large. “I also think a big piece of what online has done for us is teach [our faculty] how to use technology to make teaching and learning better,” he says. “A lot of them bring those techniques back to their Harvard College classroom.”
This trend of Extension innovation is consistent throughout other facets of the School. In terms of institutional change, Bamberg explains, “the Extension School has always been able to move much faster than FAS. If someone has a good idea for the Extension School, it is implemented and in place the next year. If someone has a good idea for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, three years later it may come up for discussion in the Faculty Council.”
Though the Extension School stands out from the rest of Harvard for these reasons, it remains connected as a branch of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As such, every Extension student who graduates does so alongside the rest of the FAS, although they receive a different, perhaps less prestigious set of degrees: the Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies, the Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies, the Associate in Arts, and an array of professional certificates.
But the vast majority of Extension students never receive one of these degrees. In fact, while 13,643 students enrolled in courses during the 2013-2014 academic year, only 700 achieved enough credits to receive a degree or certificate at that year’s graduation.
This is not to say that students are dropping out or failing to keep up. In fact, professors and administrators consistently report that Extension students tend to perform at a very high level in both Extension-only and cross-listed University courses. According to Lambert, this is the result of a self-selection process. “Even though all the courses are open access, we tend to attract people who are capable of succeeding in the courses,” Lambert says. “We don’t particularly compromise on the integrity of the course just because they’ve been out of school for a long time, or are very young, or are much older.”
Instead, this low graduation rate can be chalked up to the fact that the vast majority of students do not come to the Extension School seeking a degree at all.
According to Lambert, the Extension School has a type.
“Everything the Extension School does is optimized for a student with 10 years of work experience,” Lambert says. “[Someone] who wants to come back and either finish their undergraduate degree or get a Master’s degree.” Many students, like Ramel Racelis, roughly fit this template.
After graduating from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2012, Racelis decided to pursue his Master’s degree. Though he considered both the Extension School and Columbia’s equivalent School of Continuing Education, the Extension School’s affordable tuition and Harvard’s reputation drew Racelis to Cambridge.
“I’ve always wanted to go to Harvard,” he says.
In practice, however, there are a variety of other reasons that learners pay the proverbial two bushels of wheat.
Some students are college graduates who need to take a few required classes before they can apply to graduate schools. After studying physics at Cornell, Sarah Meyers realized that she was barking up the wrong tree.
“I was actually applying to biophysics Ph.D. programs this time a year ago, but I decided it wasn’t what I wanted to do,” she says. “I actually wanted to go to med school.” Short a few pre-med requirements, she packed her bags for Harvard.
Other students attend the Extension School not to fulfill specific requirements, but to explore broader academic interests. A former resident of Quincy House, Katherine L. Penner ’07 concentrated in Government but realized too late that her real passion was economics.
“When you’re 18 and 22, getting a degree, you know what you’re interested in at that moment. Throughout your 20s, that will change. It would be such a shame if you weren’t able to go back and study that,” Penner says. “I think the major value of the Extension School is that you can take these classes, not as a part of the degree program, but as a toe in the water.”
Still other students are ambitious teenagers who have outpaced their high school curricula and crave mental stimulation. By the end of his freshman year at Newton South High School, Daniel Shaar had finished his school’s entire math lineup, so he did what any high schooler would do: He studied multivariable calculus and linear algebra at Harvard.
If a high school sophomore seems a bit young to take Harvard classes, consider that Penner was once the teaching fellow for a homeschooled 11-year-old whiz kid.
“[He] kept up with the coursework and did all of his problem sets. [He was] always on top of everything. He really relished the opportunity to be in a class with so many people because I don’t think he got that opportunity very often at all,” Penner recalls. “Once the other students accepted that he was 11 years old and realized that he was a font of knowledge, it was very fun to watch people welcome him in.”
Believe it or not, the Extension School has even enrolled a few celebrities, including Ann L. Romney and Hilary A. Duff, who in an online journal on Feb. 4, 2005, waxed ecstatic about the School: “I’m taking on-line classes for Harvard University. Really cool! I am really excited about going back to school and the on-line classes are really cool!”
From Harvard to Plymouth State, law firms to newsrooms, Extension faculty have backgrounds as diverse as those of their students. In the 2013-2014 school year, only 56 percent of its 497 professors came from Harvard.
Why do these men and women, already consumed by their day jobs, choose to teach at the Extension School?
Many professors knock on the school’s door when their children are headed to college and their families need extra income. In addition to monetary motivation, many outside faculty are attracted by the Harvard name, which comes with a practical benefit: the use of Harvard resources.
“Widener Library is the largest university library in the world, and having access to that is absolutely vital to my personal research,” says Houchang E. Chehabi, a professor of international relations and history at Boston University who teaches two courses at the Extension School each year.
For Bamberg, the decision to teach Extension mathematics classes is motivated by his appreciation of the students’ unique perspectives on the material.
“I think the Extension students have a much clearer idea of why they are taking the course and what they want to get out of it than the [College] freshmen do,” says Bamberg, noting that adult learners’ increased focus influences the quality of their work. “I found that Extension students do just wonderful programming projects because frequently they can do stuff that’s related to their job and actually use it.”
The Extension School also opens up career avenues for teaching fellows.
After taking one of Bamberg’s courses as an Extension student in 2009, Penner was invited to become a teaching fellow for the class. She has overseen several math department courses ever since.
“I love my job,” Penner says. “Practically speaking, though, there is not another place that I could go without a Master’s degree in education or a Master’s degree in mathematics … So I don’t want to leave. I am extremely impressed with Harvard for allowing me the opportunity to explore this field of teaching.”
From the outside, the red-brick office building at 51 Brattle St. seems exactly like the rest of noisy, collegiate Harvard Square. But inside, it’s another world. The halls are silent. The Grossman Common Room is deserted. The computer labs hold solitary students, working diligently and alone. This is the home of the Division of Continuing Education. 
For some Extension students, this silence is representative of a greater isolation.
A sense of separation often rears its head in the classroom, the primary point of contact for an extremely varied group of students. “There was a demographic of people beyond college age who were also taking the class, and I didn’t feel like I had any connection to them whatsoever,” Shaar recalls.
Faculty have noticed this occasional awkwardness. “The way that you learn mathematics, especially when it’s this advanced, and especially when it’s this challenging, is by engaging with other people about it,” Penner says. “For some Extension students, that’s emotionally harder for them. It feels daunting, to approach someone who’s much younger than you.”
Other students identify some advantages to this difficult situation. “Over the summer, I was taking classes with 15-year-old kids. I was like, ‘This is weird,’” Graves recalls. “But it’s good. The integration is nice. I can share experiences with [younger] students and help them out, and they can help me remember things I don’t remember from high school, which is equally as important.”
Though students like Graves are able to find the positives in a tricky classroom dynamic, extracurricular life at the Extension School is by many accounts much bleaker.
Compared to the buzzy social scene of a traditional college, “There is not, at all, in the same sense, a community,” Lambert says. “The learners tend to connect when they’re in a class together … But I would say the greatest complaint of our students is the difficulty of creating the type of community [found at a college].”
For the motivated few, the Extension School does run a handful of student groups, including the Wellness Club, the Pre-Health Society, and the Environmental Club. Students are also permitted to participate in selected University-wide services, such as the Institute of Politics, the Phillip Brooks House Association, and the Office for the Arts.
But this narrow range of extracurriculars leaves many students disengaged. “[Extension students] are scattered around, and you don’t really get to meet them. They’re not really involved at all,” observes Vanessa Cordova, a student at the Extension School.
The administration acknowledges this dearth of social infrastructure, but has no plans for change. “We don’t have any of the rest of the student services, or a campus, or any of the things that Harvard College would have,” says Lambert, going on to add that “the adult learner with a full-time job and a family doesn’t have time for that community anyway.”
As a result of this barren social landscape, some Extension students look further afield, setting their sights on services provided by other schools of the University. In particular, many Extension students have become deeply engaged in sports and clubs within the College, ranging from religious organizations to a capella groups.
Cordova is one such student. Since her arrival on campus this fall, she has joined a Hispanic cultural group and begun working part-time at the Barker Center Café, where she has met students from the College and several graduate schools.
“When I first came here, I thought [the schools] were going to be more separated. I thought there would be a big sticker on my head that said ‘Extension School,’” Cordova recalls. She has found that that has not been the case—perhaps because most University students are oblivious to or confused about the Extension School.
“Every person asks me, ‘What’s the Extension program?’” Cordova says. “They ask, ‘What House are you associated with?’ And I have to explain, ‘No, it’s not a House. It’s an apartment.’” 
Despite initial confusion, Cordova has been welcomed by students from other areas of FAS. “They understand that I didn’t do the traditional out-of-high-school admissions process, but they don’t treat me any differently,” she says.
Graves has had a similar experience. In addition to her classes, she works part-time at the Harvard Shop and regularly attends programs hosted by the Office of Career Services. “You can make connections. I have friends from the College; I have friends from the grad schools; I have friends that work at the School,” Graves says. “You have to have the initiative to seek them out.”
But students like Cordova and Graves who successfully integrate themselves into the greater Harvard community are rare. For Extension students, University clubs and services come with significant barriers to entry: Many are available only in select cases and to select types of students, and are often not broadly advertised.
As a result, many Extension students remain reclusive. As Cordova notes, “They’re intimidated to approach or email a club: ‘Is it OK if I’m an Extension student?’”
A Harvard degree is worth a lot. With that fancy sheet of paper comes the likelihood of opportunities and the thrill of prestige. Though a Harvard degree by no means guarantees success, it rarely hurts to have one on hand.
But what is an Extension degree worth? Does it carry the weight of its undergraduate and graduate cousins? Or does the outside world view it as something different or second-rate?
“I think it’s very clear to employers what it means. The Harvard College degree is an intensive, highly selective, four-year residential learning experience. That’s pretty well reputed,” Lambert says. “I think employers understand that the people who come and do the undergraduate program at the Extension School are older … They come back to do that degree because they discovered later in life they have high intellectual capacity, and they desire to get ahead. And I think employers are very clear on what that is as opposed to a Harvard College degree.”
Regardless, current student Hieu Nguyen hopes that the outside world will believe that his Extension education demanded Harvard-level rigor, despite the fact that it did not involve a selective admissions process. “That was the exact thing I wanted to say to potential admission officers at the Ph.D. [programs]: I didn’t get any special treatment. I struggled through the class just as much as a Harvard undergrad would,” he says. “I [went] through the same thing.”
At the end of the day, perhaps an Extension degree has more value as a means to an end than as a destination in and of itself. Unlike many College students, who arrive at Harvard as interested in the all-American college experience as in far-off career prospects, Extension students come with laser-focused goals: to nab a promotion, to apply to graduate school, to beef up a resume, to conclude a college career, to explore an intellectual passion.
The Harvard Extension School gives these learners a chance—often a second chance—to achieve their aims and better their lives. “It is a lifesaver for a lot of people,” says Penner. “I think, for what it is, it’s an extremely good institution.”

Following undergraduate concerns over the limited social spaces available for first-year students, the Freshman Dean’s Office is piloting a new program to offer students bimonthly large-group social outings into Boston.
The $30,000 budget for the initiative comes from funds that were recently allocated to freshman social programming by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, according to Katherine W. Steele, the College’s director of freshman programming.
“We don’t have all the social space on campus that we need, particularly with the freshman class of 1,600 people,” Steele said, adding that the program represents a short-term solution to on-campus space constraints.
The new program coincides with growing University support for undergraduate social events. Earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust said she had allocated a lump sum to the College administration to fund social activities.
Student concerns about wanting to find time to leave campus and explore Boston also influenced the creation of the program, which will consist of 10 outings throughout the academic year.
“One of the things that we often hear in the Freshman Dean’s Office is that people choose to come to Harvard because it’s in Boston,” Steele said. “Given that there’s so much to do, it’s an easy way to infuse more life into the Harvard experience.”
So far, the Freshman Dean’s Office has hosted one outing to Laser Quest in West Roxbury. According to Torey E. Martin, the fellow for first-year programs, out of 109 freshmen who indicated interest in the event, 58 took part in the outing.
“The hope is that because [the program] is drawing from a wide variety of student interests...you’ll be meeting people across campus that you might not have had an opportunity to meet before,” Martin said. “It’s neat to see those connections.”
Martin added that the program is meant to be as accessible as possible; events will be heavily subsidized.
“The goal is to try and offer the event to as many students interested in attending,” Martin said. “We’re trying to find activities and events that would allow us to do that with the cost.”
To help plan the outings, the FDO established an off-campus social planning board, composed of at least four freshmen out of eight students in total. Although applications were officially due last Sunday, Martin said she encourages any interested students to still apply.
“We’re going to be trying to see what is it that students really want, and is bringing people off campus...what people want, or should we be doing something different?”Steele said. “It seemed like it could be a new addition to the social scene that doesn’t exist right now.”

From appearing in anti-government trials to uncovering underground cities in Spain, Harvard History professors have done it all. They showcased the range of their scholarship Wednesday evening at a panel entitled “History is Everything / Everything is History,” an annual departmental tradition now in its fourth year.
Even though the event targeted sophomores who are considering studying history, upperclassmen, graduate students, and Cambridge residents joined the prospective concentrators in hearing from five high-profile Harvard historians about the importance of their research.
Speaking about the intersection between history and science, History professor Michael McCormick said cutting-edge scientific technologies have allowed Harvard researchers to discover an ancient city in Spain and compare contemporary and historical climate change.
Discussing the impact of historical research on current events, History assistant professor Kirsten A. Weld said the recent discovery and digitization of at least 18 million documents on the Guatemalan armed forces might inspire political reform in the country.
“Social justice activists know that the study of these historical papers could be the key to writing a new history for Guatemala, and key to writing a new future,” Weld said, adding that the documents were the basis for the first-ever trial against the Guatemalan armed forces for crimes against humanity.
For History professor Caroline Elkins, a dissertation on British detention camps in colonial Kenya evolved into a book that went on to win the Pulitzer Prize. Elkins said five former camp detainees used her book to successfully sue the British government for crimes perpetrated against them during their internment.
“For the first time in its history, the British government was sued by its former subjects for compensation, and my book was used as evidence, and I was called upon to be the expert witness,” Elkins said.
Matthew R. Alderete ’19, who hopes to pursue a secondary field in History, said he found the the event interesting and Elkins’s presentation on the Kenyan detention camps particularly compelling.
“I wish they had included a professor who works on economic history, since that is where my interests lie,” he added.
History professors Samuel Moyn and Lisa M. McGirr also participated in the panel, which Andrew D. Gordon, also a History professor, chaired.

After Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, Harvard professors agree on one thing: Hillary R. Clinton emerged as the winner of the debate and the frontrunner for the Democratic Party’s nomination in 2016.
Prior to the evening debate in Las Vegas, Clinton had been losing support in the polls to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to enter the race but is considering a run. Many commentators said pressure was on Clinton to strengthen her position as the Democratic frontrunner in the face of scandal over her private email server and her impending testimony in front of the House committee tasked with investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks.
The general consensus, according to Harvard professors, is that she performed well in the debate, outshining Sanders and the lesser-known former senator Jim Webb, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, and former Rhode Island governor and senator Lincoln Chafee.
“She did exactly what she needed to do,” said David R. Gergen, a Kennedy School of Government professor who advised former President Bill Clinton, Hillary’s husband, while he was in the White House. “She has reemerged as presidential. ... She has the best opening she’s had in months to emerge as frontrunner, not just for the candidacy, but for the [White] House.”
Government professors Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 and Paul E. Peterson both echoed Gergen’s statements.
“I agree with everyone else: It was totally dominated by Hillary Clinton,” said Mansfield, who is famously conservative. “I think she did a very good job showing optimistic Republicans that she’s not fading and is going to be a formidable candidate.”
Professorial opinions of Sanders, the second-most popular candidate in the polls, were more divided.
“I thought his passion, his intensity, his capacity to argue in down-to-earth ways all served him well last night,” Gergen said.
Kennedy School professor Jeffrey A. Frankel had a similar impression. “There was quite genuine passion, especially with Bernie Sanders,” he said.
In contrast, Peterson said both Sanders’s unwillingness to press Clinton on the email scandal and his unclear stance on gun control painted him as a weak and inexperienced presidential candidate.
“I decided that after listening to the debate, Bernie Sanders is not seriously running for president,” Peterson said.
In comparison to Clinton and Sanders, Gergen said, “the other three candidates were mostly a sideshow. ... They’re not going to be a serious factor.”
Professors predicted that the debate would have little effect on the campaigns of O’Malley, Webb, and Chafee, all of whom have polled well below Clinton, Sanders, and even non-candidate Biden so far.
“The one who got hurt most,” Gergen said, “is Joe Biden.”
The vice president, who remains third in the polls, may be discouraged from joining the race following Clinton’s strong performance in the debate, some professors said.
Peterson suggested that Clinton’s strong performance sends the message that Biden would “have a tough time” running for president.
More generally, the tone of the Democratic debate was different from its Republican counterparts, according to professors.
“These debates are so often full of posturing and pretending there’s a policy difference when there isn’t,” Frankel said. “[This] debate was refreshingly focused on the substance of policy issues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 15, 2015, at 9:22 a.m.
The general public will have access to the first floor of the proposed six-story School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex in Allston on weekdays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. when it opens, Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said Wednesday. 

Casey presented more details about the University’s plans for the complex, which will house part of SEAS after it relocates from Cambridge to across the Charles River, at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Wednesday.
Allston residents have long pushed for Harvard to make its properties in the neighborhood open to area residents. The public will have limited access to the planned science complex building—which will rise to about 130 feet and span 586,000 square feet—on weekends, when likely only the first floor will stay open, Casey said Wednesday.
At the meeting Wednesday, Allston residents voiced concerns about allowing members of the public to occupy the open green spaces in the complex during night hours. Casey said security details, such as stationing a police officer or security guard, are in planning stages and that SEAS will iron them out later on.
At previous meetings, Allston residents and members of the Harvard-Allston task force had posed questions to representatives from the University, asking about planned day-to-day operations of the complex.
Despite comments from the attendees calling the task force meetings ineffective, Casey said he considered the discussions surrounding the SEAS complex a tangible sign of progress.
“These are the things that are lost in the nightly debate sometimes,” Casey said.
Earlier in the meeting, attendees criticized the task force for what they described as its lack of transparency with the Allston community at large.
One resident said the task force should consider hosting a public meeting with the Boston Redevelopment Authority and representatives from Harvard to brief residents on progress made with both groups. Others advocated for creating a vehicle of communication to broadcast task force meeting results to all Allston residents.
Task force members responded by saying that the group’s primary focus is to serve as an advisory board and work with the Boston Redevelopment Authority, although their meetings can serve as an outlet for the community.

CORRECTION: October 15, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the public will have full access to the science complex on weekdays. In fact, the public will only have access to the first floor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students accused of violating Harvard’s sexual harassment policy may turn to attorneys as their personal advisers, and if they successfully appeal investigators’ decision in their case, a body of faculty and senior administrators will rehear it, according to a new document clarifying Harvard’s handling of complaints.
On Monday, following heavy scrutiny, administrators with Harvard’s central Title IX office released a 10-page Frequently Asked Questions document offering more details about the University’s policy and procedures governing its response to sexual assault on campus.
The document seems to respond to the critiques of several professors at Harvard Law School, who throughout last school year decried the University’s centralized policies, adopted in 2014, as biased against the accused and threatening to academic freedom. They even moved to adopt their own procedures, separate from the rest of Harvard’s, for handling sexual assault complaints involving Law School students.
According to Mia Karvonides, Harvard’s Title IX officer who oversees the central investigation office, members of the Law School faculty gave feedback on drafts of the FAQ document that was included in the final version.
CLARIFYING THE PROCEDURES
While the FAQ document released this week does not itself modify the existing rules about how Harvard handles sexual harassment cases involving students, it shows in more detail how investigators in the central investigation office respond to complaints.
Notably, the document explicitly allows students, whether they are the complainant or the respondent in a case, to use attorneys as their personal advisers as they navigate the process. Personal advisers may not speak for students, but they may sit in on interviews with investigators and view copies of the complaint and other case documents.
While lawyers were never explicitly barred from serving as advisers in Harvard’s procedures as written, they are not named as potential candidates. Instead, the 2014 procedures say that personal advisers “should be an officer of the University who is affiliated with the School or unit in which the advisee is enrolled or employed” and note that they “may not be related to anyone involved in the complaint or have any other involvement in the process.”
The FAQs, though, say this personal adviser may be a lawyer. According to Karvonides, this point reflects existing practice.
“In practice, ODR has found that many students do have attorneys as personal advisors and the investigative team repeatedly informs parties of this option,” Karvonides wrote in an email, referring to the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which investigates and adjudicates all sexual harassment complaints against students across Harvard, except at the Law School.
The document also offers new information about how ODR conducts appeals. According to the University’s procedures, cases that are appealed are sent to “the Title IX Officer or designee,” a point that had drawn criticism from Law School professors. In a level of detail not included in the initial policy statement, the FAQ document indicates that this “designee” is not one person, but is instead a “standing committee of faculty and senior administrators.” 
Karvonides wrote in an email that she “designated the responsibility for appeals” to this group a year ago and noted that they are trained. They have “done a thoughtful and rigorous review of our decisions,” Karvonides wrote. “This is a structure that I welcome.”
Among other points, the 10-page document also reaffirms Karvonides’s previous assurances that Harvard’s policy protects academic freedom and classroom discussion surrounding issues like sexual assault. Specifically, the FAQ document says that speech, even of a sexual or offensive nature, that is “germane to coursework is not prohibited.”
The FAQs also say that ODR uses a “reasonable person” standard to determine whether or not sexual harassment took place in a case, meaning that it will conclude that harassment occurred if an “objective, reasonable person” would believe so given the circumstances.
The document also differentiates between the states of “intoxication” and “incapacitation” after the consumption of drugs and alcohol. A person may consent to sexual activity when intoxicated, but not incapacitated, under the policy, according to the FAQs, which note that “Sexual activity following consumption of drugs or alcohol is not automatically deemed to be unwelcome.”
RESPONDING TO CRITICISM?
The document’s clarification of Harvard’s sexual assault policy and procedures comes after members of the Law School faculty lobbied, both publicly and privately, for changes to the University-wide framework. Over the summer, the Law School implemented a separate set of Title IX procedures that in many ways differ from those in place at every other school at Harvard.
According to Jeannie C. Suk, a Law School professor and vocal critic of Harvard’s central Title IX framework, representatives from Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel in fall 2014 had indicated plans to release an FAQ document about the policies. Officials also consulted Law faculty members when crafting them, according to Karvonides.
The guidance document released Monday seems responsive to many of Suk and her colleagues’ criticisms.
“These FAQs show that the University can listen to reason on this sensitive and controversial topic,” said Janet E. Halley, a Law School professor who has led an effort at Harvard and across the country challenging what she argues is the federal government’s overzealous approach to Title IX compliance. 
Other Law School professors who have vocally criticized Harvard’s University-wide sexual assault framework similarly said they were satisfied with many components of the clarifying document.
“I think they have actually addressed the worst problems on the substantive policy side,” said Elizabeth Bartholet, one of 28 Law School faculty members who signed a letter slamming the policy last year in The Boston Globe. In particular, Bartholet praised the document’s clarification of the difference between “incapacitation” and “intoxication,” as well as its affirmation of protections for academic freedom.
Still, some Law professors said releasing an extra document to clarify aspects of Harvard’s central policies is not enough. Suk and Halley maintained that Harvard still ought to revise the 2014 framework and suggested that some clarifications in the FAQs are at odds with the initial policy documents.
“I think of this is as a very positive step forward, and I’m not holding back in saying how positive it is,” Suk said. “I do think it’s a step in a process that has to include a revision of the Harvard University policy and procedures.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Senator Claire C. McCaskill of Missouri spoke candidly about ambition, sexism in politics, her marriage, and her new memoir alongside her husband Joseph Shepard at a small event at Harvard on Wednesday.
The discussion, held in the Winthrop House senior common room and moderated by Harvard College Democrats president Jacob R. Carrel ’16, was one of several “Conversations at Harvard” events this year.
McCaskill’s famous candor stood out as she kicked off the discussion by describing shotgunning a beer with her family after finding out that her 2012 Republican opponent, Todd Akin, had won his primary, a result she had famously orchestrated. The title of her memoir, “Plenty Ladylike,” is a dig at Akin’s comment that she was not “ladylike” enough.
“If you don’t redefine [‘ladylike’], and you allow the word to be signaling that someone is demure and deferential, then you’re denying a huge swath of amazing women their full femininity,” McCaskill, a Democrat, said after the talk. “I feel very feminine, and I’m proud of being a woman, and not for a minute do I think that my outspokenness or my ambition or my strategic mind takes away from my femininity.”
McCaskill began her political career at age 28 by knocking on more than 11,000 doors to campaign for the Missouri state legislature. On Wednesday, she described snide remarks thrown her way by male colleagues and a particularly memorable moment when a constituent told her to abandon campaigning and go find a husband, slamming the door in her face.
 “I laughed it off and used humor to deflect what they were saying and doing. But I used those things to kind of fuel my fire,” she said. “I probably should have confronted more of it, but I wasn’t brave enough. I think young women today are braver; at least, I hope they are.”
McCaskill encouraged students in the audience, particularly young women, to run for office, offering to help them strategize and campaign. “That’s the main reason I wrote this book: to inspire young women to own their ambition,” she said.
The event also focused on the challenges of high-profile political marriage. Shepard recalled friends, colleagues, and a St. Louis newspaper warning him not to marry McCaskill 14 years ago, but he said ambition has fueled the couple’s strong relationship. When Carrel apologized to Shepard for not giving him more of an opportunity to talk, McCaskill said, “Bless his heart, he’s used to it.”
Both McCaskill and Shepard said their marriage has remained an important source of support personally and professionally.
“It’s easier when you’re both strong and successful,” Shepard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On one of the few weekends in Ithaca, N.Y., where the weather is actually bearable, there were remarkably few students on Cornell’s campus.
It was fall break for students, which marks an annual mass exodus from upstate New York for the second weekend of October.
It was probably a good thing the vast majority of the students weren’t around to see the Big Red Big Bloodshed.
Saturday’s 40-3 dismantling of the Cornell football team (0-4, 0-2 Ivy) was just the fourth in line in a series of 2015 slaughters by the Harvard squad (4-0, 2-0).
Surprisingly, the majority of people actually in attendance at Schoellkopf Field—definitely a much smaller number than the 7,092 recorded tickets distributed—appeared to stick out the entire game, an impressive feat considering the final 13 minutes consisted of just five first downs gained, 91 total offensive yards, and a whopping zero points.
Maybe these diehard Cornellians were somehow not bored by yet another mundane Harvard final quarter, but I was ready for this game to be over by the time Crimson quarterback Scott Hosch barreled into the end zone to begin the fourth quarter.
As Harvard coach Tim Murphy emptied the end of his bench—which has seen nearly as much playing time as the starters this season thus far—it felt like déjà vu.
Eighteen at Rhode Island, 40 against Brown, 45 versus Georgetown, and now 31 over Cornell.
Those are the leads that the Crimson has held at the third quarter for each game this season.
Of any of the teams that Harvard has faced this year, however, Cornell seemed to have the best shot of snapping the 17-game win streak—at least, early on.
When the Crimson’s offense stalled on its first possession, the Big Red marched all the way to Harvard’s 16-yard line before kicking a field goal.
Suddenly, Murphy’s team found itself in a position it had yet to experience all season: trailing.
Perhaps something about the startling and unfamiliar feeling of being behind jump-started the Crimson offense.
On the ensuing kickoff return, rookie receiver Justice Shelton Mosley showed that he was a more than adequate replacement for injured kick returner and receiver Andrew Fischer, bringing the ball 47 yards back to set up Harvard in Cornell territory.
One play later, Hosch connected with senior tight end Ben Braunecker for the score. Seventeen seconds, seven points, and trailing no longer.
The jumbotron in Schoellkopf Field tells the story from there, of the barrage of scoring that poured out from the white jerseys.
But the most damage done on the green battlefield was reflected on the other side of the score.
After the lone field goal in the first quarter, Cornell failed to reach Harvard territory until the fourth quarter—and even on that possession, the drive resulted in a punt.
The Crimson’s defense—already atop the Ivy League in points allowed and second in the FBS—looked especially sharp Saturday.
With a front seven that prides itself on stopping the run, defensive coordinator Scott Larkee will certainly be proud of a group that gave up just 37 yards to starting Big Red running back Luke Hagy, who coming into the game averaged 114 yards per game.
And when Cornell took to the air instead, the best passing defense in the Ivy League made sure that facet of the Big Red offense was just as unsuccessful.
For every three passes that Cornell quarterback Robert Somborn completed Saturday afternoon, he threw a pick. One interception was off the hands of a tipped receiver, but the other two were the result of keen awareness of the ball by Crimson linebackers.
If there was anything that could have disappointed about Harvard’s performance, it was that the 40 points on the scoreboard wasn’t higher.
Not that Harvard should keep its first-stringers out to rack up points—though the 40 points was the lowest the Crimson has scored all season after averaging 46 points over the last three games—but the margin was just 17-3 heading into the half, and there was ample opportunity early on to widen it.
Even with Cornell’s first-team All-Ivy punter, Harvard averaged a starting field position at its own 40-yard line in the first half but an inconsistent offense managed to find the end zone just twice.
The Crimson scored just 17 points off of four takeaways and had just 27 points to show for seven red zone trips during the game.
For Harvard to continue to win in the lopsided fashion Cambridge fans have become accustomed to, the offense will need to more consistently finish the job the defense starts against the upcoming stingier defenses of Princeton and Dartmouth.
But in a quiet stadium in Ithaca, the Crimson starters played well enough to massacre the Big Red, earn another relaxing final quarter, and bore this reporter for the fourth-straight week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team accomplished everything that it had to do this weekend to keep pace with the top teams in the Ivy League. The embattled squad first took down a pesky Brown unit that dealt the Crimson one of its two conference losses last season in a five-set nailbiter. The team then went on the next day to take down five-time defending conference champion Yale without the services of freshman Christina Cornelius, who is third in the conference in hitting percentage and first in blocks per set.
But for as critical a weekend that was for the Crimson, the team does not have the privilege to dwell on its past success.
With Dartmouth tied for the conference lead with Harvard and the Bulldogs and Penn lurking one game behind, any pace slower than winning out poses a significant risk to the team’s chances of repeating as Ivy League champions.
“It’s tough to keep the same level of excitement for every match, especially when we are playing teams at the bottom of the conference,” Kebe said. “But…losing to [Dartmouth] just shows us that no team should be taken lightly.”
Such a mantra will be needed as the team hits the road for the first time in Ivy League play to take on Columbia and Cornell to finish the first leg of its conference slate.
The team has not played an official away game this year.
The Crimson has only participated in three neutral site games, all three of which were losses in the Service Academy Challenge at the Pentagon.
Road play was a significant strength for Harvard last year, with its one road loss coming in the team’s first conference tilt against Dartmouth.
From there, the team won its final six road games of the year.
The year prior was a different story, however, with the team only managing four wins in 10 matches on the road.
“It is different being on the road,” Kebe said. “We do have a little less time to prepare…. But other than that, we try to treat each game the same.”
The Crimson is preparing to take on its New York foes without the services of Cornelius, who is still rehabbing from her ankle injury she incurred last weekend against Brown.
Cornelius’s presence is a big part of the Crimson gameplan, as she and co-captain Caroline Holte are first and second, respectively, in the Ivy League in blocks per game.
The duo’s presence at the net has caused headaches for opponents all season.
Critical to the Crimson’s push back to the top of the Ivy League has been the play of senior Kathleen Wallace, who made a huge leap going into her final year at Harvard.
She ranks first on the Crimson and eighth in the conference in kills per set. Her game has also expanded past just an attacking prowess, as Wallace has recorded career highs in assists and digs per set.
“I truly believe that she is one the best outside hitters in the Ivy League,” Holte said. “She’s improved every facet of her game. Her service [play has] been incredible…. I am so thankful for [her] improving every part of her game, not just the flashy parts.”
Columbia will be Harvard’s first task this weekend.
The Lions had struggled coming into last weekend, but were able to snap a three-game losing skid against Penn on Saturday, which halted the Quakers from nabbing a share of the conference lead.
Junior Zoe Jacobs was a big reason Columbia was able to pull off the small upset, notching 17 kills in only four sets. The next-closest player only had eight on the night.
The third-year star ranks seventh in kills per set in the conference, just edging Wallace.
Senior Bailey Springer caused fits for the Crimson last year, notching 22 kills—just three shy of her career high—against Harvard last season.
Harvard finishes the first portion of its Ivy League schedule against perhaps its weakest opponent in Cornell, which has yet to notch a win in conference play.
In its five games against Ancient Eight opponents, the Big Red has only won four sets.
Sophomore Emily Wemhoff looks to have to play a key role in upsetting the Crimson on Saturday, as she’s led Cornell in kills per set with just over two-and-a-half per game.
“Every team deserves our respect and attention,” Kebe said. “We tried to prepare for Cornell and Columbia just like we’d prepare for Brown and Yale.”
