After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A24 hosted an early screening of Jonah Hill’s directorial debut, “Mid90s,” at Brattle Theater on Oct. 2. Managing to pack the theater to capacity, the movie stars Sunny Suljic, Lucas Hedges, Na-kel Smith, Olan Prenatt, Gio Galicia, and Ryder McLaughlin. In this coming-of-age film set in 90s-era Los Angeles, 13 year-old Stevie (Sunny Suljic) manages to cope with his troubled homelife and terrorizing brother (Lucas Hedges) by befriending a group of skaters. Immediately after the screening, the cast walked on stage for a brief question and answer session almost as if they had stepped right off the movie screen — Sunny was even wearing his same baggy jeans from the set.
The Crimson sat down with Sunny Suljic, Olan Prenatt, Gio Galicia, and Ryder McLaughlin the next day for an interview about making this film with a screen veteran like Jonah Hill. Despite the interview taking place in a ritzy hotel with a view overlooking the harbor, it was immediately clear that this cast was not intimidated by their surroundings. Unable to suppress giggles at each others’ stories, debating over whether the bone is called the “tibia” or “tibulla,” and occasionally kicking each other under the table, the cast of “Mid90s” focused much more on being real and honest with their responses than being dryly serious and professional.
So much of the film hinges on the believability of close friendships between these characters, yet this was not a forced or unnatural process for the actors. “We definitely connected like right away because we all have something in common which is skating. So, it’s really easy for us skaters because we’re all like pretty welcoming,” Suljic said.
And the incredible bonding wasn’t just between the cast. Working with Jonah Hill, a man who’s been acting approximately as long as any of the four of them have been alive, could have been daunting, but clearly he became an admirable role model and also a friend. When asked about his favorite memories from working on set, Ryder, who plays the dim-witted “Fourth Grade,” replied, “It was all the bits. We had all these inside jokes.”
Prenatt, who plays the fun-loving, but unambitious “Fuckshit,” couldn’t contain his excitement as his face lit up remembering the hilarious moment when Hill took a dive on set. “So it’s this dance where you start by doing a handstand and then you kinda do the worm like very fluidly onto the ground and all of us did it but then Jonah did it and just flopped,” he clarified as the whole cast proceeded to crack up.
Contributing to the overall authenticity of the film, Hill familiarized his cast with the era, hoping to help them step into the mindset of a kid growing up with less technology but more privacy from overbearing parents. According to Galicia, who plays the tough but also jealous Ruben, “He gave us iPods with all the soundtrack for the movie.”
Olan added, “We studied ’90s skate films, and on the iPod that they were talking about are all songs that our characters would listen to. It gained our understanding of who these characters are because you can identify parts of somebody by who they listen to.”
Although Hill also enforced a strict no-cellphone policy, Ryder commented, “I didn’t even know it was a thing. I really just put my phone in the trailer because I didn’t want it to ring on set.” The entire cast seemed quite positive about the experience.
From a surface-level point of view, it might seem strange that Jonah cast skaters he could teach to act and not the other way around, yet these young stars demonstrate how their passion and dedication to the sport cannot be easily imitated. As Suljic said, “When I’m not acting, I’m skating constantly so I do it like 24/7. We all do it every single day and if we don’t, it’s kinda weird, we’re off.”
Galicia added, “For me, once you skate for like a really long time and you don’t skate just on a normal day, it feels really weird… When I don’t skate, I’m just bored, like, ‘What do I do?’”
Describing his method as a brand-new actor for making his performance as genuine as possible, Prenatt explained, “Obviously from an emotional standpoint, I’d be just living after I studied the script but realized how I look when I get mad. I’d get mad and say, ‘Oh wait, let me rewind. What did I do when I got mad? Okay, I looked to the left and then in half-a-second, closed my eyes.’”
In a moment of introspection, McLaughlin noted about his slow character, “My mouth is always open, which I didn’t realize until I watched it, which I thought was super weird.” Despite their relative inexperience, the actors attested to a commitment to immerse themselves in their characters and fully commit even subconsciously.
Despite demonstrating a remarkable amount of insight and wisdom about their new profession, these young actors are still just a self-described fun-loving group of talented kids finding their way in the world. Sunny said it all when he put on airs and claimed, “I’m a professional Fortnite extremer.” The film will be released Oct. 25.
Correction: Oct. 16, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated the film "Mid90s" will be released Oct. 19. In fact, it will be released Oct. 25 in the Boston area.

With its set, cast, and script stripped down to the core, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s modernized rendition of Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” strives to make the iconic story more accessible than ever. The play, which will run in the Loeb Ex at 8 p.m. on Oct. 13 to 14 and Oct. 18 to 20, is cut down to only 90 minutes and seven characters while focusing on the original work’s central themes in order to be as relatable as possible for its college audience.
“We wanted to do a very contemporary and modern version of ‘Hamlet,’” co-producer and lighting designer Chloe I. Yu ’21 says. “I think a lot of times people feel alienated from Shakespeare because of the language and its [setting] in the 1600s, but I think the themes of mental illness and sexual assault and suicide are really relevant to modern times. We wanted to try to bring life back into one of the best tragedies and put it on at Harvard.”
One element that transforms this adaptation is its gender-blind cast. Director Isaiah O. Michalski ’21 wants to explore the altered character dynamics in “Hamlet” with a male Ophelia, a female Horatio, a female Laertes, and a nonbinary Polonius. Benjamin A. K. Topa ’21, who plays Hamlet, also hopes that the casting furthers the show’s universality.
“I think [the gender blind casting] makes it more accessible,” Topa says. “I hope there are more people in the audience who I hope will say: That’s me. This means something to me, this is not someone else. This is today, and I see reflections of myself on stage. I think that’s beautiful, and it’s important to have people understand what we are hoping to be able to communicate.”
Co-producer Leo A. Garcia ’21 explains that the show’s technical elements are another unique component of the adaptation.
“In order to modernize it, the locations and whatnot are a little more ambiguous,” Garcia says. Set designer Byron S. Hurlbut ’21 spent a lot of time conceptualizing what needed to be on stage and in what ways the set could be used to differentiate between scenes without having to change too much. Costume designer Nikole L. Naloy ’21 dressed the cast in all white costumes except for Hamlet, revealing that the protagonist’s mask of purity — which is represented by the white — is visibly tarnished. These details come together to produce a unique yet cohesive design for the entire show.
As different as this production is from Shakespeare’s original play, the cast and crew still anticipate that viewers with various degrees of familiarity with the work will be able to engage with it.
“For those people who are very well versed in ‘Hamlet,’ they’ll recognize a lot of the smaller references that we have throughout in costumes and blocking….I think because of the gender switch and some of the editing to the script, it’ll feel like watching a new play a bit to those who have seen it before. To those who haven’t seen it before, it will be a good way to enter the world of ‘Hamlet’ because we have tried to make it as entertaining but also as accessible as possible and as urgent as possible,” Michalski says.
The cast and crews’ ultimate aim is to create an emotional and challenging experience that communicates the play’s themes.
“I want to perform Hamlet in a way that is accessible, so people can see themselves in Hamlet, even if that’s not a comfortable thing….People would like to think they'd never get here, but I think the way ‘Hamlet’ is written shows how dangerous you yourself can be, and how dangerous feelings can be even if they’re ‘just feelings,’” Topa says.
The modernization of the play is rooted in the themes of the original.
“[This] may be the most famous play ever written, and I think that’s because the issues that are examined in the play are issues that everyone experiences in their own life: the questions of mortality, of agency, of generational conflict,” Michalski says. With this interpretation, the cast and crew hope to reinvent a classic, making its central conversations accessible to an even broader audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge celebrated Indigenous People’s Day earlier this week, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology added a new piece to their first floor Native American galleries: the Native American Poets Playlist. The installation, which opened on Oct. 1, is an effort co-sponsored by the Harvard University Native American Program and the Woodberry Poetry Room and a new idea that features the contemporary poetic voices of Native Americans with historic artifacts.
The playlist consists of eight contemporary poems by indigenous poets drawn from the anthology “New Poets of Native Nations,” edited by Heid E. Erdrich. Museum visitors are encouraged to check out an audio device and listen to the poems, each read aloud by its respective poet. The playlist will be available at the museum until Nov. 30.
Polly Hubbard, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology Education Department Manager, created the concept of a poetry playlist for the museum visitor’s experience. She was first inspired to push the museum to celebrate Indigenous People’s Day in a contemporary way after reading a newspaper article about Cambridge officially celebrating Indigenous People’s Day rather than what was Columbus Day just over two years ago. Her initial idea was to create an exhibit, but she quickly realized it was not feasible for the timeframe, opting instead to refresh what was already in the museum. Hubbard noted how Native American history is oral history.
“It would make total sense to bring in this contemporary orality back to this space — and we have it in some little spaces in the more up to date exhibits — but we don’t have the emotional life through these poetic arts,” Hubbard said.
The Peabody Museum first agreed to the idea in December 2017, and the project became an experiment. Hubbard said she began by looking through the poems from the Woodberry Poetry Room. Because she was searching for contemporary voices, Shelley Lowe, Executive Director of the Harvard University Native American Program, and Zoe Eddy of the Wendat/Huron peoples, a graduate student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, recommended an anthology from which Hubbord eventually selected the poems. Lowe and Eddy also served on the poem selection committee.
Throughout the compilation process, the selection committee received constant feedback from indigenous communities and additional support from museum staff. Eddy saw this playlist as a much-needed critical intervention in the museum world, which has historically overlooked minority perspectives. She noted the playlist speaks to the existence of art movements within contemporary native communities.
“People assume we’re either relics of the past or that we’re static, inertia-filled beings of the present,” Eddy said.
The curators wanted to create an ebb and flow of emotion with the poems, which showcase a range of voices young and old. One poem in the playlist is in the Ojibwe language, followed by an English translation. Margaret Noodin, poet and Associate Professor of English and American Indian Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said she had never presented poetry aurally in a museum before.
“For me, the most important thing about the playlist is that our languages are alive and that we’re able to have voice,” she said.
The artists and curators of the playlist hope that people begin to think more about the spaces they occupy, and that museum visitors that step inside will want to hear more.
“The Native Indigenous voice on this continent can really help people feel anchored in place. Whether it’s part of your heritage or whether it’s not, to know this space differently is something people can benefit from,” Noodin said.
The playlist acts not so much as a trial run but as proof that spoken poetry can have a role in museum spaces. By implementing the unconventional, the Peabody Museum has created an exhibition not only to be be seen but also understood, critiqued, and praised. 2019 marks the International Year of Indigenous Languages, and, by then, Hubbard hopes to develop another project based on the feedback from this playlist for the Peabody Museum.

Harvard and its new graduate student union will face each other across the bargaining table for the first time Monday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Friday afternoon.
The opening session marks the culmination of a years-long push by Harvard’s graduate students to negotiate their own wages and benefits with the University. In 2015, The Crimson reported that a small group of students had begun organizing behind closed doors to form a union on campus. That push took off rapidly, culminating in two contentious unionization elections over the past two years.
The first saw more students vote against unionization than for — but, on April 18 and 19, 2018, the results of the second of those elections fell firmly in favor of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. The University announced its intention to bargain with HSGU-UAW 11 days later, ensuring the official installment of a graduate student union on campus for the first time in Harvard history.
Both the University and the union have spent the intervening months preparing to bargain.
The union formed a 13-member bargaining team whose members surveyed HGSU-UAW’s membership and produced a list of bargaining goals. Kenneth Lang, a United Automobile Workers organizer, is advising the committee. Lang came to Harvard from Columbia, where graduate students are currently considering a second strike in a bid to force administrators to negotiate.
The University’s bargaining team includes several faculty members, outside legal counsel and representatives from the Provost’s Office, the Office of Labor and Employee Relations, Financial Administration, the General Counsel’s Office, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, according to Paul Curran, director of labor relations and employee relations.
In his email, Garber outlined key positions University administrators plan to take during negotiations. Chief among them is maintaining a strong dividing line between issues related to labor and issues related to academics. Which issues are open for negotiation may become a point of contention in the coming months as HGSU-UAW members argue for expansive contract proposals drawn from their initial 80-item list of bargaining goals.
“Because there is so little legal precedent involving a student union at a private university, the boundaries between terms and conditions of employment and issues of involving academic activity are not clear,” Garber wrote. “I also want to emphasize that, throughout this process, our responsibility is first and foremost to provide the best possible education to all students and to meeting our fundamental commitments as an academic institution.”
“We are not under any obligation to negotiate with the United Auto Workers about academic matters, and will not do so. We will not agree to terms that will compromise our educational mission,” he added.
Garber also wrote that the University anticipates the bargaining process will be lengthy, as is typical of a fledgling union’s first contract negotiations.
“Initial collective bargaining agreements are inherently time-consuming, and this will be especially true for a bargaining unit of this size and heterogeneity,” Garber wrote.
In anticipation of the first hours of bargaining, HGSU-UAW plans to rally in Harvard Yard on Monday morning before the session starts. The event, titled “Bargain Fest" on social media, will feature “signs, Solidarity Cider, and lots of festive cheer,” according to an HGSU-UAW Facebook event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard led by 16 points heading into the fourth quarter. Seven minutes later, Holy Cross led by one — its first and only lead of the night. As the clocked ticked down to two seconds, that lead remained.
At the eight-yard line, Crimson coach Tim Murphy sent out his kicker to attempt the do-or-die field goal. The Crusaders’ called a timeout to ice junior Jake McIntyre. It didn’t matter. The junior booted the ball through the uprights.
As he watched his kick sail between the posts, McIntyre turned toward the Harvard sideline, holder Tom Stewart threw his helmet, and the Crimson bench stormed the field, piling up the kicker.
“On the sideline obviously I thought about the fact that they’d ice me, and I never really considered that a big factor,” McIntyre said. “But when you hop on the field and you can trust and rely on everyone else out there, whether it’s Jack Stansell or Tom Stewart, or everyone else blocking on the line, it makes everything else a hell of a lot easier. So I don’t really know what was going through my mind at that moment, but they set me up in a good position and I’m glad the way it turned out.”
The 33-31 victory by Harvard (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) was anything but smooth. The team’s fourth-quarter woes began with a read option left to Holy Cross’ Domenic Cozier and the ensuing two point conversion that cut the lead to eight.
The Crimson’s special teams inefficiencies then reared their ugly head as the Crusaders (1-6, 0-2 Patriot) sent a tumbling kickoff towards Harvard’s two back returners. The ball bounced directly between them and hobbled down to the Crimson two-yard line before senior Adam Scott fell on it.
Senior Tom Stewart set up to receive the snap to open the drive, feet planted squarely in his own endzone. The snap sailed over the waiting quarterback’s head and out of the back end zone — the team had allowed its second safety of the season.
With its offense taking the field only one play after scoring a touchdown, Holy Cross captured all the available momentum. This time, the Crusaders earned a single first down and nothing more. The ensuing punt sailed 47 yards to Scott, landing in his arms before bouncing out and into the awaiting Holy Cross defenders, another special teams falter.
The visitors capitalized. On the first play from scrimmage, senior quarterback Geoff Wade found wideout Martin Dorsey on a back shoulder fade over the top of his defender. With the successful extra point, the visitors took their first lead of the night — erasing the 16-point fourth quarter deficit in only seven minutes.
“I thought Geoff [Wade] did an unbelievable job,” said Crusaders coach Bob Chesney. “Martin [Dorsey] obviously did an unbelievable job with all the other guys out there. We ran the ball better. We distributed the ball better. We did a lot of things better. Special teams was better. Everything was better, which is good. It’s just not enough.”
Coming up big for Harvard were players whose gametime had been thus far limited. Until this week, few had heard of sophomore wideout Tyler Adams. Then he caught two of the biggest passes of the night.
The Crimson began its game-winning campaign from its own 29 with 3:34 remaining to play. At the visitors’ 41, Harvard faced fourth and four. Rather than rely on the legs of his backfield, Murphy trusted Stewart’s arm and Stewart trusted Adams’ hands, tossing the pass to the sophomore who pulled it down despite his defender, John Smith, laying on his back.
With a new set of downs in hand, Stewart went back to the sophomore, this time deep. Stepping into the oncoming blitz, the senior play caller got hit as he threw, tossing the pass short to an Adams in double coverage. Adams planted his foot, came back to the ball and caught the pass despite pass interference from Smith. First down the Crimson at the five-yard line. From there, McIntyre stole the show.
Adams concluded his career night with a career best seven receptions for 84 yards.
Tonight’s challenge represented Stewart’s second career start for Harvard after he spelled sophomore quarterback Jake Smith in last week’s Cornell game. The senior’s only previous start was also against Holy Cross in 2016, a 27-17 Crimson loss.
“That definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,” Stewart said. “[I] definitely wanted to get a little bit of revenge and I couldn’t be happier with the way it turned out.”
While Stewart has been the backup through the first four contests, he played like a veteran starter tonight. The senior completed 20 of his 36 attempts for 272 yards and two touchdowns.
Overall, Harvard rushed for only four yards less. Senior and 2017 first team All-Ivy running back Charlie Booker returned to play this week, earning 31 yards on 10 attempts. Supplementing this performance was sophomore Aaron Shampklin with 128 yards on 13 carries, sophomore Devin Darrington with 32 on three carries and Tyler Adams with 33 on two attempts.
The Crimson came out of the gates hot on the chilly night. In the game’s first drive, sophomore running back Aaron Shampklin waited until just the third snap to break a 57-yard sprint down the left sideline for six.
The drive concluded in an incompletion, however, as Harvard opted for a two-point conversion. The effort fell short as the backwards pass hit the hands of the receiver and then the turf.
The Crimson’s second two-point effort compensated for the loss. Following sophomore wideout James Batch’s 35-yard touchdown reception, Stewart went to the air again. This time he tossed a high pass to sophomore tight end Adam West cutting across the back of the end zone. The second-year bobbled it once and pulled it down just before his knee landed out of bounds.
While in football the red zone is any point within 20 yards of the endzone, tonight the “Crimson zone” seemed to lie anywhere beyond the 20. None of Harvard’s touchdowns came from within that 20-yard mark.
The Crimson has struggled in the red zone all season. Only twice this season has Harvard entered the final 20 yards and left with six points — both these instances occurred against San Diego in week one of the season.
However, the Crimson’s four appearances in the red zone netted 12 points total, as McIntyre nailed four of his five tries — scoring from 34, 21, 30 and 25 yards, respectively. His only miss came on a 42-yard attempt — the same yardage as his career long set last week at Cornell. The kicker currently sits at sixth in program history for career points as a kicker.
The Harvard defensive front held strong for the majority of the game, totalling four sacks for 24 lost yards and allowing only 148 rushing yards.
In fact, the game was only at a nine-point spread up until the last 40 seconds of the third quarter. The Crusaders’ Wade took his drop and was enveloped by a mass of blockers and defenders. Sophomore linebacker Andrew Irwin and senior defensive tackle Stone Hart punched the ball out.
Crimson sophomore Jordan Hill recovered the fumble. Stewart found sophomore receiver Tyler Adams two plays later for the 28-yard score. The 16-point lead was Harvard’s largest of the night.
“Bottom line is our kids really came together today as a team,” Murphy said. “They really showed their true character, their true grit. And that was just a tremendously gritty win over a good football team, a football team that gave us all we could handle and then some.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning the last eight games, No. 11 Harvard (11-1, 3-0 Ivy League) goes into its game on Saturday against Cornell looking to set a new program record for wins in a row. The Crimson has been absolutely dominant this season, with its sole loss this season against one of the strongest teams in the nation, No. 3 Maryland.
Its No.11 ranking on the Penn Monto/NFHCA Division I Coaches Poll is its highest ranking in program history. Harvard looks to build on its successes from the past two seasons where it also had winning streaks of six games or more.
The Crimson also has the third highest winning percentage in the nation (.917) and is only two wins away from the program record (13). Cornell, on the other hand, has not had the most spectacular season, with a 3-8 overall record, and no conference wins. However, the series between Harvard and Big Red has always been competitive, with the Crimson holding a slim 7-6 advantage over the last 13 meetings. If Harvard is to make history and win its ninth game in a row, it cannot take Big Red for granted, and will have to bring its best efforts.
Harvard’s success this season is a result of its strong defensive play and and a balanced offensive game. The Crimson averages only 0.83 team goals against, which is the third best mark in the nation while also having the tenth best scoring attack in the nation, with an average 3.25 goals per game.
The versatility on both the defensive and offensive side has allowed Harvard to beat its opponents in dominant fashion, with six shutout victories already this season. Its offensive prowess has been spearheaded by juniors Bente Van Vlijmen (nine goals, five assists) and Maddie Earle (nine goals, two assists).
Vlijmen has been on a historic run, having scored 23 points already this season, and is on pace to break the single season scoring record (42 points) held by Judy Collins ‘99 and Shelley Maasdorp ‘05. Earle has also been instrumental to Harvard’s lethal attack with seven goals in the last six games.
Going into Saturday’s game against Cornell, the Crimson will have to keep up the phenomenal play from both of its veteran leaders and its underclassmen. Captain Kathleen Young proved herself in the clutch this past weekend, with a tie-breaking goal against Brown last Friday. In that same game, senior goalie Libby Manela earned the win against the Bears, and improved to 5-0 on the season. These seniors will need to have another stellar performance to ensure that Big Red does not upset Harvard at home.
First year Harvard goalie Ellie Shahbo also has to maintain her outstanding contributions, having won five straight starts and only allowing two goals within that span. If both its experienced and young talent perform up to expectations this weekend, the Crimson should have no trouble securing a victory.
Finally, it is critical that Harvard keeps Cornell’s top scorers in check, and continue to be aggressive with its offensive attack. Big Red has a 83-5 record in games in which they score three goals. Inhibiting leading scorer Kristen Pienaar from feeling comfortable will be integral to stifling Cornell’s attack. It is also essential that the Crimson has momentum from the start of the game. Big Red has a 114-15 record when they score first, showing that they are a significantly stronger team with early momentum.
While Harvard has proven before that they can still beat Cornell even when they score three goals, as evidenced by their 4-3 overtime victory over Big Red last year, the prevention of early scoring should be of utmost priority for the Crimson. Harvard should also keep up a strong scoring attack throughout the game in order to pester Cornell’s goalie Maddie Henry. Henry has shown her prowess with five double-digit save outings in her career, and is a goalie that is very difficult to score on.
Therefore, the Crimson will need to maintain its stalwart defensive play and potent offensive attack in order to come away with a victory against Big Red this weekend. Harvard will have the chance to make history on Berylson Field, and will need this win to continue breaking records and keep up its momentum as they face some of the strongest teams in the nation.
