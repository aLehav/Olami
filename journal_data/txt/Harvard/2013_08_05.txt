After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NIKKO, Japan—There is a Japanese saying that goes, “Never say kekko until you’ve seen Nikko.” Kekko means magnificent, splendid, wonderful; as I stood surrounded by gold leaf-covered buildings, I could certainly understand what the phrase was driving at.
Located two hours away from Tokyo, Nikko is a World Heritage site renowned for its sprawling temple complex. Probably the most famous structure in the complex is Toshogu, a shrine devoted to the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu after his death. In a zealous assertion of “more is more,” every surface of every building is covered in either gold, wood carvings, or gold-covered wood carvings. Many of these carvings have achieved considerable renown: Toshogu’s famous “Sleeping Cat” is said to have been carved by an artist with his left hand as a last taunt to the jealous sculptors who had cut off his right one. Another carving, depicting the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil monkeys, is part of a larger Shinto allegorical carving, this particular panel portraying the ideal way to raise children. And this, of course, is to say nothing of the golden elephant heads tucked into the corners of the roofs, the golden hydrangea carvings capping many of the beams, or the fact that a golden Tokugawa family seal glitters at the end of each row of roof tiles on every building, all of which seems to be taken as a matter of course. Whether you consider it gaudy or ornate, Toshogu’s ability to create drama and catch attention is undeniable. While I have included pictures here, the feel of just being there, with these gleaming buildings towering over me on all sides, is something that they cannot capture. Nor, indeed, can they capture the feeling I got when I saw Toshogu’s hand washing area and realized that it was more valuable than my house.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tessalon Bishop loved seeing his family members learn.
He made a point to expose his two young daughters, now 2 and 7, to educational experiences, often taking them to museums like the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. 
He also went out of his way to encourage his younger sister Anita A. Fritz to finish college. Fritz said that when she graduates from the University of Massachusetts Boston, she will dedicate her diploma to Bishop, who died in a car accident on I-95 on July 22. He was 33.
“I feel like I can’t let him down, because he encouraged me and because he believed in me,” Fritz said.
Family members remember Bishop, who worked as a security officer at Harvard, as a caring brother and son who was always full of energy and as a loving father who went “above and beyond” to support his daughters. They say that they will miss Bishop’s compassion, love for life, and warm words of encouragement.
“I couldn’t ask for a better son,” said his mother Desiree Charles, who called Bishop her best friend. “I love him dearly, and will continue loving him, until we meet again.”
Bishop sought to find the best in any situation, his family said. Patricia A. Bishop, Bishop’s older sister, described her brother as “always upbeat,” with a variety of interests ranging from rap music to fashion. He was even optimistic in the most difficult of times, Patricia Bishop said.
“He would even see the bright side in [his death],” Patricia Bishop said. “He will find some way to [say], ‘Oh, look, I’m with God; God is with me.’”
At Harvard, Bishop served as a security officer with Securitas, the company that employs Harvard’s security guards. Bishop worked as an overnight guard, overseeing the Museum of Natural History and several other surrounding buildings, and sometimes picked up a day shift, according to Kevin M. Ebert, assistant director of operations at the Museum of Natural History. Bishop, who was known to friends and coworkers by his last name, really cared about his job and “always had a smile on his face,” Ebert said.
“I can’t remember a time where he didn’t come in, smiling ear to ear,” Ebert said. “He seemed to generally care about you as a person in your situation, your family.”
Fritz said she thinks Bishop worked as hard as he did at his job at Harvard because he wanted to provide for his daughters. “They were his everything,” she said.
For her part, Patricia Bishop said that the thing she will most miss about her brother is simply hearing his voice. He used to call her “all the time,” she said, sometimes just to see how she was doing.
“We could rely on each other, no matter what for,” Patricia Bishop said.
Along with his mother, daughters, and sisters, Bishop is survived by additional siblings, nieces, and nephews. He was remembered at a public wake this past Friday morning at the Grace of All Nations Church in Dorchester.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight.
 
Most Ivy League students have traded in their textbooks for ties or travel for the summer, but that hasn't kept their campuses out of the headlines in recent weeks.
 
In case you missed it, the New York Times reported a shocking new trend in a feature last month detailing the "hookup culture" at Penn: Some college-aged women have casual sex. (Wow.) What could possibly explain this breaking news, you ask? In fact, the paper of record concludes, some college women are too busy or ambitious for committed relationships, among other factors.
 
That might seem simplistic, particularly for a nearly 4,800-word article that took months to report, and students at Penn seem to agree. The Daily Pennsylvanian reports that, of the students they interviewed, "most" objected to the article’s portrayal of their campus. The DP also published its own editorial proclaiming that “[author Kate] Taylor drew conclusions that inaccurately represented and overly generalized the university's student body.”
 
In more serious news over in New Haven, Yale released its fourth semi-annual report of sexual misconduct complaints this past Wednesday. A total of 61 complaints of sexual assault, harassment, or other misconduct were brought to Yale officials between Jan. 1 and June 30. That number represents the greatest number of reported complaints since Yale began releasing the reports, according to the Yale Daily News.
 
At Cornell, more fraternities than even exist at Harvard are in trouble with the university for reports of hazing. Cornell shut down two fraternities and sanctioned four more following investigations that occurred during the spring. One frat is being punished by being put on "provisional recognition status for at least four years,"according to the Cornell Daily Sun—something that wouldn’t be such a big deal at Harvard, considering that officials here refuse to recognize frats and sororities (not to mention final clubs) at all.
 
Greek life is also once again in the news at Dartmouth, where fraternities came under national scrutiny in 2012 after Rolling Stone magazine published a piece detailing allegations of hazing at a campus fraternity. Last month, a three-foot ball python went missing from a coed fraternity for several days, only to be found by a dog who was "'yapping really loudly,'" The Dartmouth reported.
