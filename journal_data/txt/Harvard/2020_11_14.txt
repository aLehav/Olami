After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, you might think HBO’s new series, “Industry,” is about a Harvard blocking group. While this is not the case, the show does follow an eclectic group of five recent grads gunning for positions at the London investment bank Pierpoint & Co., posing questions about the morality of capitalism. The show aptly begins in the impersonal gloom of a corporate office, and follows the aspiring careerists through their first six months at Pierpoint as they slowly uncover the darker side of corporate life. Rather than sit with the unease of these ambiguities, however, “Industry” frequently averts its gaze, glamorizing the very culture it aims to call into question.
Despite its occasional inconsistencies, “Industry” features an impressive set of actors who — for the most part — successfully portray the nuanced conflicts of their characters. Rising actor Harry Lawtey deftly captures the smugness and charismatic swagger of Oxford jock Robert. Nabhaan Rizwan displays the deep-seated insecurities of Hari (Nabhaan Rizwan) while David Jonsson embodies the quiet intelligence of Oxford and Eton grad Augustus “Gus.” The show’s sets, which alternate between Pierpoint and the hires’ cramped apartments, also underscore the double lives that the characters lead.
Days into their careers, breathless young hires pile into a conference room where managing director Eric (Ken Leung) and executive Sara (Priyanga Burford) facilitate initiation. Moments after congratulating them on surviving a grueling application process, the executives emphasize that in half a year’s time, one in two hires will be let go. “So look at the guy or gal next to you — really look. Do you think you’re better than them? Maybe you are. But half of you won’t be here in six months,” Eric admonishes. His recurrent emphasis on competition and exclusivity demand the question: How can genuine collaboration occur when employees are conditioned to believe their worth hinges on the inferiority of their teammates? Pierpoint — sleek with panoramic glass walls, spiraling staircases, and obscure postmodern art — quickly begins to resemble a fashionable prison.
“Industry” extends its most incisive commentary on the lucrative seductiveness of finance during shots that illuminate the granular miseries of corporate life. Robert reckons with an apathetic, taciturn superior while Hari, buckling under the insecurity of failing to attend an elite university, chugs Red Bulls as he fumbles over financial models until dawn. At one point, Harper (Myha’la Herrold) even endures the sexual advances of a drunken client in a cab. Moments of genuine distress briefly shatter the proud façades of the show’s burgeoning careerists: In the first episode, a drunken Hari confides to Harper, “I went to state school, and they even talk to me differently.” It is in these moments — when the propulsive exhilaration of money-making is replaced with slow, contemplative vulnerability — that the show realizes its fullest potential.
The characters’ competing interests are flattened, however, by unrealistic audacity and stiff dialogue that borders on didactic. After her ugly encounter with an abrasive boss at a team dinner, Harper comforts a dejected Yasmin (Marisa Abela). “No one’s gonna give you agency,” the former philosophizes, taking a hit of a Juul. “You have to take it. Try not to think about all the different ways that you can be wrong.” Harper’s abrupt pep talk seems patronizing — not to mention woefully contrived — in the face of the verbal abuse Yasmin experiences at the hands of her superiors. In another scene, Harper cusses at a senior employee, begging him to help her with a botched trade deal. Her clear disregard for authority is neither admirable nor empowering: It simply makes the show less believable. Despite her brazen irreverence, Harper is somehow miraculously exempt from being fired, a prospect that drives her fellow competitors into a state of perpetual anxiety.
Aesthetically and morally compelling sequences partially redeem the exasperating two-dimensionality of Harper’s character. Scenes of Yasmin, Hari, and Gus trailing after harping executives and finicky clients are interspersed with mesmerizing sequences in which the young hires — nervous, disoriented, and giddy with the promise of an ascendent future — sway, drunk and high, in gorgeous vintage bars. The vapid materialism of “Mad Men” meets the shimmering, psychedelic abandon and brooding angst of “Euphoria.”
For all its pomp and drama, “Industry,” at least in its first four episodes, fails to deliver a coherent argument about the ethics of climbing the hierarchy in a workplace so suffocatingly competitive. Through juxtaposed sequences of fist-pumping sales victories and bathroom meltdowns, the show can’t seem to decide between romanticizing wealth or condemning its dehumanizing power.
The characters’ unresolved ambivalence toward their work is more aggravating than poignant. Though they lament the dubious ethics of embracing capitalism, they do so while reveling in the very lifestyle — one of fancy steak dinners, coveted social status, and a seemingly endless supply of coke and bubbly — they purport to take issue with. Sure, the protagonists’ conflicted agony between personal fulfillment and money is understandable, perhaps even inevitable. That doesn’t negate the fact that their woes are dwarfed by those of people who aren’t gunning for six-figure salaries months after graduation. Though “Industry” extends a rich moral conundrum, it lacks the observational teeth to sink into the nuanced complexities of its own prompt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When viewers scroll through Netflix’s ever-growing menu of new and original content, “The Midnight Gospel,” with its vibrant colors and trippy animation, demands attention. The show explores a stunning and psychedelic universe — drawing on creator Pendleton Ward’s experience with “Adventure Time” — through the eyes of earnest and inquisitive “spacecaster” (read: interstellar podcaster) Clancy. Each episode, Clancy, with the help of an illicit multiverse simulator, travels to a unique world on the brink of collapse, interviewing an inhabitant as they traverse the apocalypse and explore thought-provoking new ways to understand the big questions of life, from forgiveness, to death, to drug use, and even life imprisonment.
While the show’s use of the infinite multiverse trope might be reminiscent of “Rick and Morty,” the ethos of the two shows couldn’t be more different. To cope with traumas from their pasts, Rick becomes embittered and nihilistic to a fault, while Clancy searches far and wide for ways to find meaning and purpose in a life marred by loss. In this way, “The Midnight Gospel” is both brutally honest and inspiringly optimistic, addressing the reality of death head on, but using it to emphasize — rather than to diminish — the significance of life and of existence. What’s especially unique about the way “The Midnight Gospel” conveys this is that the audio from Clancy’s spacecast interviews is actually repurposed from “Duncan Trussell Family Hour,” creator Duncan Trussell’s real-life podcast. So, while the wild and imaginative plots make the show entertaining, it remains grounded in real, authentic advice.
This juxtaposition of vibrant, chaotic apocalyptic imagery with calm, conversational dialogue proves to be the most striking aspect of the show. Initially, that dichotomy builds a feeling of disjointedness. For example, the first episode sees Clancy discuss drug use with the president of an Earth-like world while joining him to fend off an increasingly dangerous and absurd zombie apocalypse. In the second, Clancy takes on themes of mortality with a hippopotamus while the two are fed through a slaughterhouse assembly line. With all this going on, the viewer is sometimes drawn more to the imagery, losing track of the conversation, or vice versa — enthralled in the dialogue and missing important symbols in the animation. However, this show is one that merits rewatching, and the more close attention you give it, the more you can pick up on the subtle and powerful resonances between the imagery and the conversations that ultimately make each episode impressively profound.
These resonances are most pronounced in the show’s heartbreaking final episode “Mouse of Silver,” in which Clancy interviews his own mother on accepting a stage four cancer diagnosis. The animation shows Clancy and his mother rapidly aging, being reborn, and dissolving into cosmic energy — imagery inspired by Buddhist notions of samsara and the cyclical birth and death of both the universe and the soul. That juxtaposition complements and enriches their conversation on using mindfulness meditation to accept the reality of death. We not only learn the basics of a Buddhist practice that can help us to cope with grief, but also gain a deeper understanding of how Buddhists make sense of the universe as a whole.
This is the magic of “The Midnight Gospel”: The show not only teaches viewers about powerful life philosophies like a great podcast might, but also uses plot, characters, and animations to explore what those ideas look like in practice. It’s invented an entirely new medium, which — given the saturation of the media landscape today — is groundbreaking and worthy of highest praise. Albeit complex at times, the show will make you think and wonder in a way you hadn’t remembered you still could, and by the end, it’ll leave you at once enlightened and in tears. By any one of its many dimensions or all, it’s certainly worth the watch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The premise of “Two Weeks to Live” is simple. What would you do if you were going to die in two weeks? When Kim (Maisie Williams) is told that the world is on the brink of apocalypse, she does something the rest of us would not: She sets out to avenge her father’s death.
And then, in episode two, the premise of the show fizzles out entirely. Within just an episode and a half, Kim tracks down her father’s murderer, Jimmy (Sean Pertwee), and kills him. She also learns that the world is not, in fact, going to end — it was just a prank pulled by her friends Nicky (Mawaan Rizwan) and Jay (Taheen Modak). The subsequent plot arc, which extends through the rest of the season, is bland in comparison to the deceptively action-packed opening. Kim, her friends, and her mother evade Jimmy’s minions who seek revenge and a stolen bag of money. There are quirky antics along the way, but for an action show, “Two Weeks to Live” spends the majority of the season waffling around in low-stakes territory, having used up its better material in the first 40 minutes of run time.
“Two Weeks to Live” is well shot and well edited. It is at its best early on, during Kim and Jimmy’s fight. The camera is well choreographed to catch the actors’ movements and impressive stunt work; the cuts are fluid and never detract from the scene. After the second episode, the cinematography and editing are rarely impressive or memorable. The fight scenes that come later in the season do not match the momentum or energy of the first. Though this never actively detracts from the quality of the show, it leaves the viewer wishing that the show’s aesthetics were more ambitious.
Perhaps the most frustrating characteristic of the show is its frequent use of bathos, the juxtaposition of serious moments with jokes or irony (think Tony Stark’s quips in the MCU). During Kim and Jimmy’s fight in episode two, they engage in cliched hero-villain banter — “They call me The Grim Reaper,” Jimmy threatens. “You’re about to reap what you sow,” Kim responds. It’s a slightly cringey exchange, but not egregiously so, and matches the melodrama of the scene at hand. But immediately afterwards, the tone completely switches and the two become ironic and self aware: “Oh, that’s a really nice exchange that, I like that,” Jimmy says. “Yeah, it just felt organic,” Kim jokes in reply. While at first amusing, this type of humor quickly becomes tiresome and repetitive, and the heavy-handed self-awareness feels out of place.
Like “Two Weeks Left to Live,” “Killing Eve” blends action and comedy, but is able to use humor to magnify the messaging of the show; its dark and irreverent brand of comedy punctuates the most important elements of the show, bringing its themes and characters into sharper focus. Likewise, “Succession,” a fellow HBO show, uses satire to critique its characters while maintaining the overall structure of a TV drama. For shows like these, comedy is essential to its storytelling, adding nuance and complexity. “Two Weeks to Live” simply lacks that symbiosis between humor and storytelling. The constant meta-jokes aren’t subversive, just distracting and tiresome.
Tina, played by Sian Clifford, is the most charismatic character in the cast. A survivalist who lives completely off the grid, she hates the materialism of modern society. In episode four, a simple breakfast becomes the target of her complaints: “Toast that comes out of a machine, a single portion of jam wrapped in so much plastic it could kill a small whale,” she snaps at Kim. The other characters — Nicky, a nerdy sweetheart, or Jay, a redeemable bro — pale in comparison to her, coming across as common and tropey. The only comparable character is Kim, but Kim is too inconsistent: naive one moment, cynical the next — hopeful then disillusioned.
Ultimately, Tina is the only character asking serious questions of the world around them. Without another character to contradict or disagree with her, her negative worldview goes unquestioned, giving the group’s interactions a bleak feel. Yet, simultaneously, the show seems to want to be optimistic. Relationships develop, bonds are strengthened, Kim continues to explore the world with wide eyes. It is inconsistent to have one character condemn society for its materialism, but then to continue engaging with it without resolving that tension. In the fourth episode, Tina is easily swayed into going to the carnival with Kim and Nicky, a decision that is clearly against her worldview. The show has no desire to seriously interrogate the questions it brings up — Tina’s lifestyle is a character quirk, rather than something worth substantively interrogating.
“Two Weeks to Live” shies away from all of its most interesting material, from Kim’s revenge arc to Tina’s anti-materialist philosophy. The show tries to be two things at once: a feel-good show, affirming the goodness of human relationships through its sitcom-esque cast of characters and a drama-filled thriller navigating the bleakness of revenge and humanity. At times, the show seems poised to navigate this well, as it does in the early episodes of the show, oscillating neatly between action and comedy with visually impressive scenes. But as the show drags on, it fails to do either, becoming increasingly rhythmic and bland.
