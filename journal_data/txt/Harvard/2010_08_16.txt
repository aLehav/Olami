After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent Harvard Kennedy School graduate is taking a shot at culinary stardom.
Shadiah D. Sigala, who currently co-hosts a talk show on Cambridge Community Television, is one of 15 finalists for an audition with the producers of "The Next Food Network Star."
Sigala, who graduated with a master's in public policy in 2008, said she chose to cook a favorite Mexican dish—tinga—in her video audition, which was selected from more than 200 submissions.
“It was a really wonderful boost,” she said. “The Food Network thinks I’m good!"
Over the past two weeks, viewers worldwide have voted for their favorite videos on YouTube.
After the poll closes tomorrow night, the winner will be invited to an in-person audition for a chance to compete on the show, which will air in 2011.
The Cambridge resident said she has been amazed by the popularity of her YouTube video, which has been viewed over 59,000 times.
"I have been wallpapering Facebook and LinkedIn, reaching out to anybody and their mother that I’ve ever met,” she said.
Born in Mexico, the self-styled "urban Mexican" cook said her mother and grandmother taught her to cook at a young age.
“I’d come home from school and know that I would have to prepare the meal that night,” she said. “Today, I make something a little more nuanced, a little more urban.”
By adding techniques and ingredients from other cultures such as Asian cuisine, she said she is able to make the traditional dishes she was taught her own.
Sigala said that when she is not working at a large health insurance firm, she acts in community theater productions and co-hosts her CCTV show.
"I just realized that there’s this creative person inside of me just dying to break loose,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s equity holdings were reduced 18.8 percent this past quarter amid a 10.6-percent fall in the Dow Jones industrial average during the same period and increased exposure to emerging markets.
Harvard held 94 securities totaling $1.44 billion in the quarter ending June 30—a drop from the $1.78 billion in equities Harvard held in the previous quarter, according to Harvard Management Company’s quarterly 13F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission released Friday.
From the filing, it is unclear if the decrease represents a loss or simply a reallocation of funds. Since Harvard money managers moved back into the stock market at the end of 2009—when the value of Harvard’s holdings totaled $2.26 billion—the University's stock holdings have declined for two consecutive quarters.
The filing offers only a glimpse into the management of Harvard's endowment, which was valued at $26 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, since the 13F only lists positions in securities listed on U.S. exchanges that HMC directly controls.
Outside money managers invest about two-thirds of the endowment, and the HMC may also have other financial investments such as real estate that would not be listed on a 13F disclosure.
Similar to previous quarters, exchange-traded products that track the performance of emerging markets make up 78.5 percent of the value of Harvard’s positions.
Harvard’s two largest positions—both in terms of quantity and value—are in two exchange-traded funds that track global emerging markets and the performance of 25 large Chinese companies.
Meanwhile, the HMC shed $56.5 million of a Brazilian ETF, opting instead to invest in individual Brazilian firms spanning sectors ranging from finance to telecommunications, and added more than 1 million shares of an ETF that invests in India to its portfolio.
The value of Harvard’s positions in Indonesia, the Netherlands, Russia, and Thailand all increased by at least $3 million, while investments in Israeli firms that were listed in previous filings did not appear on this past quarter’s disclosure.
The apparent sale of securities in Israeli companies prompted some speculation that political motivations were driving trades, particularly in light of the Israeli raid of a Turkish flotilla.
But University spokesman John D. Longbrake said in an e-mailed statement the University has not divested from Israel. Longbrake added that holdings in developed markets, such as Israel, are managed by outside investors, meaning that it would not appear on the HMC's 13F.
On the domestic front, HMC’s $45.9 million investment in XTO Energy and $45.3 million investment in BJ Services listed on the first quarter’s 13F did not appear, though it is not clear whether this was related to the effects of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on the oil industry.
At the end of the last quarter, Harvard also held 6,000 shares of Goldman Sachs, which came under scrutiny for marketing a subprime mortgage product but settled those charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the quarter ended.
Other notable domestic investments that are new to this past quarter’s disclosure include an $11.7 million stake in Qwest Communications and a $10.4 million position in Boots and Coots, a company known for its emergency response capabilities to oil well disasters that Halliburton is interested in acquiring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAKE PLACID, N.Y.—Lake Placid, though known to most of the world as the site of 1980’s Miracle on Ice, is best known to me as the site of my summer vacations. So imagine my surprise when I walked out of the movie theater on Sunday evening and was promptly ushered into the Olympic Center to watch some women’s hockey.
The nation’s best female hockey players have descended on Lake Placid this week as part of the Women’s National Festival. Among them are three current Harvard skaters, two alumnae, and Crimson head coach Katey Stone.
On Sunday night, I arrived at the 1980 Rink just in time to see the red squad (the over-22 team, which includes 12 2010 Olympians) square off against the blue squad (the US under-18 select team). If it seems like a lopsided matchup, well, it was—the veterans routed the young guns, 5-0.
But for the Harvard skaters, the romp was a chance for them to showcase their skills. Rising tri-captains Leanna Coskren and Kate Buesser each notched an assist, while Julie Chu ’06-’07 and Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08, both Olympic veterans, saw plenty of ice time. Stone, a fixture on the national coaching scene, led the team from behind the bench.
The real star for the red squad, though, was four-time Olympian Jenny Potter, who netted the first four goals of the game before Boston College’s Kelli Stack iced the win with a last-minute top-shelf shot. At 31, Potter is twice the age of some of the U-18 skaters.
Though the Crimson is most prominently represented on the veteran team, rising sophomore Josephine Pucci is also participating at the festival on the white squad, the U-22 select team. Pucci, a defenseman, and her team lost, 3-1, to the red squad on Saturday night. She will be traveling to Toronto this week with the select team to participate in the Women’s Under-22 Series against Canada’s national squad.
Joining Pucci on the U-22 roster is recent high school graduate Kendall Coyne, who is one of the elite players in her class. Coyne’s recruitment was closely followed by the hockey world, but rather than joining a college team this season, she will be doing a postgraduate year at the Berkshire School—with the ultimate goal of playing for Harvard.
With Crimson players past, present, and possibly future on the ice in Lake Placid this week, it felt almost like winter for a few hours. That is, until I walked out of the arena and into a warm August night. The season’s still a few months away, but Harvard fans can take pride in knowing that for many of the Crimson skaters, preparation has already begun.

Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren was appointed chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel in 2008, named Bostonian of the Year in 2009 by The Globe for bringing “a sense of sanity to the economic crisis," and is currently a contender to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency.
It was only a matter of time before she was honored in a music video.
The Main Street Brigade, the group behind this Western-themed rap video, is a self-described "rapid response team" that supported the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (which Warren has advocated for since 2007).  Now, the brigade wants everyone to know that "Sheriff Warren's what we need, yo." Warren doesn't actually appear in the video, but check it out anyway for a very catchy chorus.
