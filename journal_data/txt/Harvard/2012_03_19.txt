After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine yourself in the wackiest talent show any high school could host. Now, slowly and carefully, imagine that the talents are recitals of children’s books, short stories, and non-fiction essays. Modify the two hosts slightly so that one has a jaunty green and pink hat right out of Royal Ascot, and the other a Nerf gun to shoot darts at the contestants who ramble on for too long. The two finalists must affix widely renowned literary mustaches of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and George Orwell to a life-size black-and-white portrait of a mustacheless Ernest Hemingway blindfolded as accurately as possible in order to determine the winner. The spectacle has been hosted by Todd Zuniga and Kirsten Sims for the past six years and features all-star judges Tom Perotta, Niki Luparelli and Joe Piccirillo.
Kenneth Calhoun, author of “Big Swing”
Roving Reporter: What’s your inspiration for your work?
KC: I go through my life, and I see things happen in life. I decide to put a frame around it and exaggerate it to the point it’s humorous, satirical, or surreal.
RR: Do you think books resemble sushi?
KC: Books can resemble sushi in the rawness. They do resemble sushi physically as well, if you consider maki.
Bob Shea, a children’s author/illustrator living in Connecticut
RR: What did you think of the judges tonight?
BS: They did a great job; one of them is sitting right there!
Niki Luparelli: Don’t worry about me; I won’t hurt you.
RR: Did you become a children’s author to be able to pick up chicks more easily?
BS: No, well, uh– I [became a children’s author] after I got married so no. Not only that, but all the chicks I meet have children of their own, so it wouldn’t have been a very good thing.
RR: I’m sorry.
BS: I’m sorry, as well.
RR: Lastly, do children actually like your books?
BS: They do. Children and parents actually like them. Especially the dinosaur ones I showed. [The dinosaurs] in the books get to flip out all the time, so they aren’t quiet books. Kids love ‘em.
Lizzie Stark, author of “Leaving Mundania”
RR: How would you describe the Literary Death Match experience in one word?
LS: Anxiety-producing.
RR: How often do you wear elf ears?
LS: I have never worn them before until tonight. Almost never. Once.
RR: This is a new beginning?
LS: This is a new beginning.
RR: If James Joyce were a sushi roll, what kind of sushi would he be?
LS: He would be a very expensive sushi roll…made of [the] finest, endangered shark.
Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich, winner of tonight’s Literary Death Match, author of “In the Fade”
RR: How would you describe your experience in three words?
AML: High-stakes, exhilarating, and awesome.
RR: Do you consider Literary Death Match as a milestone in your career?
AML: Yes, a milestone of fun!
RR: What are you planning to do with the prize [a life-size poster of Hemingway on which the contestants stuck mustaches]?
AML: I am planning to put the poster of Hemingway mustacheless in my study in Allentown, so that Hemingway can look down at me mustacheless as I write and I can try to write him a mustache.
RR: Write him a mustache?
AML: Yes, I will write him a mustache. I don’t know what that means, but then Hemingway and I will drink bourbon together.
RR: If your work were sushi, how much wasabi would you recommend going in the soy sauce?
AML: I always ask for extra wasabi.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tom Perrotta is the author of seven books and has most recently published “The Leftovers,” which he is adapting into a TV series for HBO. Perrotta once taught Expository  Writing 11 at Harvard and has since delved into screenwriting. Two of his novels, “Election” and “Little Children,” have been adapted into feature films. On March 6, Perrotta returned to Harvard as part of the Writers at Work Lecture Series hosted by the Harvard College Writing Program.
The Harvard Crimson: Did you always want to be a writer?
Tom Perrotta: Yeah. I think if you had asked me the first day of college, I would have told you that I wanted to be a writer.
THC: You’ve written some pretty intense novels dealing with subjects many writers would be hesitant to tackle. There’s a rapture-like apocalypse in your new novel, “The Leftovers,” Christian fundamentalism in “The Abstinence Teacher,” and child molestation in “Little Children.” Where any of those novels particularly hard to write about?
TP: Every novel has some obstacle or difficulty that looms really large. In the case of “Little Children,” for example, I was really concerned with this character who’s a pedophile and [was] trying to figure out a way to address that really dark subject matter in a way that I could live with. I ended up mostly describing that character from the point of view of his mother, who was the only person who loved him. With “Abstinence Teacher,” I wanted to be really there and accurate in describing my Christian characters. I didn’t want anyone to feel that I was condescending, so I had to do a lot of research.
THC: You’ve also had two of your books turned into movies. Can you tell us about what that process was like?
TP: You know, it wasn’t something I thought much about until Election happened in a very fortuitous way. At first I thought, you know, this is really great…but somehow I got drawn into it. I really loved the movie “Election,” and as a result of that movie, I got some offers to do some screenwriting. I was teaching an Expos class at that time, when the movie came out.... I stopped teaching and took a year off to learn how to write screenplays. I haven’t been teaching in any sort of permanent way since then.
THC: Do you prefer writing screenplays to novels?
TP: Ah, no. No, I don’t. But I like some parts of it. I often have some psychic down time after finishing a novel, but I can take advantage of that period to adapt my own work or try to write an original screenplay. It can be a good way to make a writing life.
THC: When I read a book and then watch the movie adaption, I can never go back to the book without imagining the movie actors in the roles of the characters. Does the same thing happen to you with your own books?
TP: Yeah, and that’s one of the difficulties for a writer. Once a character is up on screen and played by a particular actor or actress, they get imprinted on your brain. So if I [was] to pick up Election and do a reading right now, I would see Reese Witherspoon and Mathew Broderick rather than whatever it was that I saw when I was writing the book.
THC: What advice would you give to young writers at Harvard or elsewhere?
TP: Well, one of the things I say is, “Do as I say and not as I did.” I went to a Museum of Fine Arts creative writing program very quickly out of college. Now, as I look back, I say that I wish I had stayed in the world, working and getting some wider experience…maybe gone to grad school a little later.  So there’s that, and another thing I can say is you have to develop almost a kind of freakish resilience. For most writers, it takes a long time to get a career started, and there’s a lot of rejection, and you have to somehow learn to make yourself strong enough.
THC: Do you collect rejection slips?
TP: Well, I certainly don’t linger over them, but I have envelopes full—I can show my scars, if you wanted to see them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 5, students had the opportunity to sit with Ella Hickson, the critically acclaimed writer of “Hot Mess” and “Eight” to get an inside look into the life of a successful playwright. The talk was sponsored by the Office for the Arts as a part of its Learning from Performers series and featured a moderated discussion between Hickson and Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor who directed the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s rendition “Hot Mess” at Harvard. The talk focused specifically on Hickson’s success at a very young age and provided a forum the Harvard community to discuss the theater industry with an accomplished professional.
Three years ago, Hickson sprung into the theater world with her debut play “Eight,” a series of eight monologues that went on to win the Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award. According to Tom S. Lee, Program Director of the Learning from Performers series, said the OFA chose to invite Hickson because some students can relate to her aspirations. “I was impressed by the fact that she has established her career in the theater in a relatively short amount of time, and thought that would resonate with students who are considering entering the field after college,” he says.
Hickson began by speaking about the beginning of her career and her background writing fictional pieces for her university newspaper, a pursuit which lead to the production of “Eight” and an all-expense-paid trip to New York City to receive the Carol Tambor award. She also spoke about her initial struggles when moving to the United States and having the pressure of writing a follow-up play after the success of her first play. “Ella was twenty-three when ‘Eight’ was going up, and she came New York and had a show on an off-Broadway venue,” said McTaggart, “And then ‘Eight’ was published.”
Hickson soon became anxious due to this level of international professional achievement and lack of real experience. “I think it’s a kind of cultural illness of our age. We’re so fixated on youth, and so fixated with talent in youth. It creates a real anxiety when you’re given all your opportunity at a time when you have no experience,” she said. This anxiety, Hickson noted, lead her to write “Precious Little Talent,” her first attempt at a play rather than a performance based on monologues.
The event also took a turn from a moderated talk between McTaggart and Hickson to a show featuring two monologues from “Eight.” The monologues were performed by Daniel J. Giles ’13 and Kathleen S. O’Bierne ’15. The first focused on a man’s reflections on his boyfriend’s recent death by hanging; the second, on a woman contemplating whether or not to tell her boyfriend that she is having an affair. These monologues provided a keen insight not only into the depth of Hickson’s writing, but also into the emotional battles that contemporary Americans must fight on a daily basis. “I felt empowered performing this particular monologue, which is about a woman who is talking about cheating on her long time boyfriend in order to gain some sort of recognition in this relationship where she feels invisible,” said O’Bierne about “Astrid,” the monologue that she performed. “I loved the frankness of [Hickson’s] writing and her refusal to apologize for her generation.”
The monologue performances marked the first time in years that Hickson had seen her work in “Eight” acted out. “When ‘Eight’ first happened, from the first performance to the last performance, I think I saw it 68 times,” she said. Hickson then took a hiatus from viewing her work in “Eight,” but after watching the performances during the event she noted appreciation in the chance to re-watch her own work. “It’s lovely. It feels like an old friend,” she said.
Hickson and McTaggart also compared “Eight” to “Hot Mess,” noting the potential for the audience to emotionally relate to both works in different ways. There is an element of subtlety in achieving specificity of message and emotion in plays like “Hot Mess” and “Precious Little Talent” subtely but specifically address the idea of message and emotion in the story formed throughout the performance. “I think that as a rule the more specific you can be, the more universal the truth you can gain from that specificity. You can hone that specificity in action, in dramatic dialogue. You can get that specificity that a monologue pinpoints through an interaction between characters,” Hickson said. “You don’t have to say to the audience that this is exactly what you’re thinking.”
The discussion between Hickson and McTaggart and monologues that accompanied the talk highlighted Hickson’s unique ability to translate her own thoughts into something that is relevant in contemporary society. “All of us can relate to what the young characters of ‘Hot Mess’ are going through—coming of age, figuring out one’s place in the world, trying to connect with others, exploring love and sexuality,” said Lee. “To evoke these states of mind without sentiment or melodrama: that’s a rare gift.”

An earlier version of this article said that the talk by playwright Ella Hickson was sponsored by the Office of Fine Arts. In fact, the office is called the Office for the Arts. In addition, the article stated that Hickson won the Edinburgh Fringe competition. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is actually a three-week entertainment event, not a competition. Daniel J. Giles was named in the article as a member of the Class of 2014; in fact he is a member of the Class of 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School recently announced the opening of a new classroom in Mumbai, India. The space, designed to mirror Business School classrooms in Boston, will house the school’s executive education programs in India, allowing Harvard to establish a permanent presence in South Asia. This classroom is but the latest addition to the Business School regional centers scattered across the globe, from Europe to Latin America to Japan.
The Crimson is pleased to see that Harvard is continuing its efforts to expand internationally and become a truly global institution. We are by no means the only American university to seek new horizons in this manner. To mention just a few examples, New York University inaugurated its Abu Dhabi campus in 2010, and Cornell’s Weill Medical College maintains an outpost in Doha, Qatar. As higher education becomes global, host countries can only benefit, and we are glad that Harvard is leading in this positive trend.
It goes without saying that American universities can provide foreign countries with a valuable service by establishing operations abroad. The graduates of such institutions can enjoy the benefits of an education comparable to one that they would receive in the United States without having to face the significant barriers, financial and otherwise, that international students must often overcome.
Some have charged that as American universities expand transnationally, they may merely replicate the structures of colonialism in an attempt to gain profit and reputation. This concern should be dismissed; Harvard and its peers are not guided by the mistakes of the past but by a vision of the future. It is true that Western values may clash against local traditions on Harvard’s foreign satellites. But insofar as these traditions involve homophobia, religious intolerance, or other attitudes we would not tolerate in Cambridge, such a clash can lead to positive change.
For all the progress Harvard has made internationally in recent years—much of it dating from Larry Summers’ tenure as president, such as the expansion of study abroad options for undergraduates—more remains to be done. One field in which the University lags is online education, which has the potential to reach far more than any satellite campus expansion could. Harvard should consider developing a system like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MITx Project, which is set to debut soon and will offer some sort of accreditation. Such a system of online learning could be used to promote the liberal arts abroad, in places where higher education remains largely professional. Harvard remains, at its core, a liberal arts institution, and this is one of the most valuable legacies we can share with the world.
Globalization has altered the world in unexpected ways, and it will surely bring more change in years to come. If Harvard is to remain relevant as one of the premiere institutions of higher learning in the world, it must keep up with the times. Because of this, we firmly support the University’s efforts at international expansion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent weeks, two articles about sex have been widely read on campus. One, by Michael F. Cotter ’14, described that the social epidemic of rape goes underappreciated. The other, by Nathalie R. Miraval ’14, reported that there is a previously unnoticed group of undergraduates who like kinky sex. These articles are totally different, and the contrast expresses the central dilemma of sex at college. While many young Americans have a sexual coming-of-age in their early twenties, in the social environment of college this transformation can be accompanied by significant collateral damage: sexual violence.
Obviously, no sane person is “for” sexual assault, but it’s worth listing the consequences here. Sexual assault renders lasting personal trauma. It affects a person’s trust in others, the degree to which they feel safe in a place they consider home, and the health of future relationships. On a larger scale, the prevalence of sexual assault stokes gender wars and breeds mistrust within close college communities. In this context, a vital part of making college campuses places of both safety and personal development is combating sexual violence. Unfortunately, the conversation on this subject is polarized and distorted. So, moving forward, we should re-evaluate our entire framework for confronting sexual assault.
As reported by the U.S. Department of Justice, 20 to 25 percent of women will be victims of completed or attempted rape during their undergraduate careers. Because students spend an average of nine months a year for five years in college, this means that slightly under 3 percent of college women become victims in an academic year. Many of these assaults are by the same people. As a 20-year longitudinal study by University of Massachusetts psychologist David Lisak found, on college campuses, repeat offenders account for nine out of every 10 rapes. Therefore, the problem of combating sexual violence largely entails identifying and punishing outliers.
Why is it so easy for sexual assailants to hide on college campuses? It is the framework of social interactions at college that creates an environment where these people can masquerade as an inevitable part of the “sorry for partying” lifestyle.
First, college men are often taught to use overtly sexualized interactions as a diagnostic tool for sexual interest, instead of words. Grinding is a perfect example— a guy grabs a girl from behind and starts dancing with her, “mons pubis a mons pubis,” as Tom Wolfe memorably described in his college set piece, “I Am Charlotte Simmons.” It’s a process so bizarre that it happens only in the dark. Unwanted grinding and groping are low-level interactions that seem of little consequence, but they set a standard for hooking up that encourages physical boldness by men and poor communication by women. Indeed, the trope that girls are fundamentally indecisive and have to be told—physically—what they want is at the root of the “No means yes, yes means anal,” chant of the infamous Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter at Yale.
Second, college women can be willfully naïve or purposefully dishonest about their romantic intentions. They are often not vocal when they are not interested in a guy and find small actions discomforting. They may only let on that, “that guy is so sketchy,” after the fact, and thus let men get away with minor cases of sexual harassment. Such social magnanimity is excessive and not a luxury college females have if they want to contribute to a safer mode of social interaction.
Given this reasoning, we should begin to combat sexual assault by encouraging a healthier overall standard of social interactions, with less presumption and deception. Instead of “consent,” advocacy groups should preach “communication” throughout the process of hooking up. This means guys should seek concrete indications of consent from the initial stages of an interaction. This also means girls should be more honest about their everyday intentions, and more frequently say “we can only hang out in a friends capacity.” An open and honest paradigm of communication can minimize hurt feelings and harm.
In this landscape of more transparent sexual communication, it will be easier to identify and avoid genuine predators. Those who won’t listen when someone says “I don’t want to dance,” will probably not listen when someone says, “I don’t want to have sex.”
Sexual violence at colleges is being taken seriously by nearly everyone but students. Legislative measures, such as the 2011 Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, have taken important steps, such as assuring prompt investigation of accusations and mandating awareness training. However, the efforts of middle-aged adults can only take us so far. In order to tackle this issue, a majority of undergraduates themselves have to join the cause. It is in the arena of small actions that we can take the most meaningful steps toward combating sexual violence.

President Obama bets the chalk. Every March, in what has become a public relations ritual, Mr. Obama releases his National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament brackets, and, every March, he—like the rest of America—fails to complete a perfect bracket. This failure, though, does not bother me (in fact, Mr. Obama identified the winning Tar Heels in 2009, in a March of his happier salad days, with an extra ten-plus percent of Americans’ approval). But the chalk—the chalk gets to me.
“Betting the chalk” is a vestige from pre-electronic gambling, which refers to heavily relying on favorites—so called because, as more and more money poured in behind the favorite, chalkboard listings required constant updates. Unlike the case for most betting scenarios, in the standard March Madness pool (albeit some allot extra points to upset picks), only correct answers matter. So betting the chalk has the highest odds of success, and also the highest odds of being replicated, which in the average year’s large office pool leaves a chalk-better with a respectable but unimpressive finish. Betting the chalk is cautious. It is prudent but restricted. Both above-average and mediocre. You might almost call it conservative.
That term rarely finds its way to President Obama, but it really does fit his bracketology. Of twelve prior Final Four selections as president, he has chosen nine number one seeds and, in a bold departure, three number two teams. (It turns out, only about 42 percent of the correct twelve were ones or twos, but then again, I’m not here to grade performance; mine is much worse.) This year’s bracket is no less cautious. It sports two number one teams in the final four, and two twos—but those second-seeds are matched up opposite the weakest pair of the top four, Syracuse and Michigan State. The lone long-shot in the Sweet Sixteen is North Carolina State—but, despite the 11-seed branding, Las Vegas favored the Wolfpack to win their first game over number six San Diego State. Aside from a few less-than-daring ten-over-seven selections, Mr. Obama’s only other upset of note comes from number 12 Virginia Commonwealth. But the twelve-seed upset is de rigueur; a twelve has undone a five-seed in all but three prior tournaments—and what better a choice than last year’s glass-slippered darlings, VCU? One might even accuse the Obama bracket as politically influenced (three of four Final Four teams—University of North Carolina, Ohio State, and Missouri—from potential 2012 battlegrounds) if it weren’t for the uniform sterility those picks embody. That is, if the chalk weren’t flying everywhere.
Mr. Obama’s brackets say something about him. That conjecture might feel unfair, but he is the POTUS—over-scrutiny is a price he pays. At least, those cautious picks fit a broader narrative. The president, in many respects, has had a cautious tenure (and his campaign, like it or not—with its patented pay-your-fair-share and say-no-to-the-party-of-no approach—seems similarly situated). After a predictable early-on push for campaign promises, Mr. Obama has followed, in many respects the path of least resistance. On foreign policy and terrorism he has gestured to the left with some war-ending grandiosity but has dithered in Afghanistan, unwilling to fully leave or to fully stay, and has dealt with captured terrorists as a Republican might. On the economic frontier, his debt-ceiling kerfuffle ended in anti-climax—no new revenues, no substantive cuts. The list is longer, but, in fairness, there have been obstacles. Yet Steve Jobs’ words must speak for many on the left: “The president is very smart. But he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done. It infuriates me.”
Still, I must confess, my view is biased: I am no Obama-enthusiast. But although I sit on the spectrum’s conservative half, that doesn’t mean I embrace caution, at least not political caution (maybe I am living through America vicariously; I’ll talk that one over with my therapist). It does mean I am faced with a probable nominee who relishes that embrace. An odds-on Republican who clings to an opinion poll the way pundits accuse his counterpart of clinging to a teleprompter, a man made by the free market who has blared out anti-market trade positions, a politician whose healthcare proposals morph as one voting pool supplants another, a candidate with a low-change tax policy, who opted for a slightly-more-change tax policy when pushed. A man “not plugged-in enough,” in his words, even to complete a March Madness bracket (lest he pick incorrectly). All of that well-publicized caution triggers a guttural frustration in me—playing not to lose, as they say; not playing to win.
Most people, my economics textbook tells me, are risk-averse: They gain less happiness from each marginal bit of something good—and thus more unhappiness from each marginal piece that disappears. That might mean we should welcome a cautious president—and I certainly don’t want a firebrand. But maybe, I want a president with conviction, with a vision for the country, not a piecemealed rearguard scheme. Maybe I want a Lincoln or a Reagan or (and this is conservative anathema) a Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Sure, betting the chalk puts you right up near the top. But maybe I want to win.

Two weeks ago the Graduate Student Council hosted what it called an Open Forum with Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, the administrator charged with overseeing the library restructuring and the public face of Harvard’s threatened layoffs. As a forum for a discussion, and as a space open for debate, the GSC event was a farce. Unfortunately, this failure to engage the Harvard community in a meaningful dialogue is now part of an established pattern whereby library workers, students, and community members are excluded from the decision making process at Harvard.
We call upon Garber, Library Executive Director Helen Shenton, and University President Drew G. Faust to engage students, staff, and faculty in a sustained dialogue on our libraries. Given the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the library restructuring, we urge Garber, Shenton, and Faust to pause, consider carefully the concerns of the Harvard community, and assure all workers and staff that they are vital participants in the future of our libraries. We need a firm commitment: real participation by library users and no layoffs for library workers.
The “Open Form” proved neither open nor substantive. Garber did not answer a single challenging question about the Harvard libraries. After filibustering for thirty-five minutes by recounting the details of his academic training, Garber escaped serious questioning and discussion for the next twenty-five minutes by answering only pre-screened and pre-approved questions. Although he promised to answer questions after the meeting, he departed angrily when asked about the University’s plan to lay off workers.
GSC President Cammie Valdez and Treasurer Mary Moore shielded Garber from the inquiries of attendees of the Open Forum while prioritizing non-controversial subjects pre-submitted online. Many of these “questions” were obvious attempts to avoid Garber’s present role: the library’s head henchmen, responsible for giving academic respectability to the aggressive labor-cutting being pursued under the guise of library “restructuring.” Unable to follow-up or press Garber on his misleading statistics and evasive answers, attendees were prevented from having a real discussion on the libraries and layoffs.
Harvard has already shrunk the library workforce by more than four hundred workers since 2003, from around 1400 to around 950 today. Cracks in the once venerable system are emerging. Moving collections to the Harvard Depository has become so rushed that librarians believe invaluable documents will be lost forever. Mangled, incomplete or faulty listings threaten to undermine the entire search system as incremental errors accumulate. Quickly-trained student workers have been pressed into service in the place of professional research librarians. Harvard’s libraries must not be treated as merely a cost in the balance sheet. The staff who make these libraries a reality for scholarship and research are not just labor costs.
Layoffs of Harvard library staff are neither inevitable nor necessary. Garber has propagated this assumption while the Crimson editorial board has blithely embraced it. Workers, meanwhile, are left to wonder anxiously about their future. The Harvard community must begin to address and reverse this corrosive assumption that layoffs are necessary. Misleading statistics and claims, like Harvard’s spending more on the libraries than its peer institutions must be met with the obvious fact that our collection is twice as large. Moreover, Provost Garber knows this. Why does he resort to misleading statements? We are owed, and the future of the libraries depends upon, discussion, reconsideration, and redirection towards a plan that values our priceless scholarly collections and the labor of those who create and sustain our libraries.
Harvard library workers are dedicated, highly trained, and committed to improving the libraries and serving patrons. They possess priceless institutional knowledge that cannot be digitized or outsourced. We must recognize their knowledge, experience, and contribution. From dozens of conversations and meetings with staff across the library system, it is clear to us that workers oppose this restructuring not because they are selfishly protecting their jobs but because they understand from their internal perspective that the current plans threaten the integrity of an institution they cherish: Harvard’s libraries. Rather than wanting to preserve supposedly redundant jobs, library workers need to be given the space, security, and respect to do their work well. Unless we all recognize that their library work is essential to scholarship of our whole community, not only will the libraries suffer but so also will this university and its position as a leader in research and learning

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, George Clooney, an actor and human rights activist, praised the humanitarian work of a Harvard group.
The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, an organization based primarily at the Harvard School of Public Health that brings together undergraduates and graduate students to work on a variety of social action projects, contributes to the Satellite Sentinel Project which Clooney co-founded.
Speaking of the Harvard students’ contributions to his efforts to expose the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, Clooney said to the Congressional committee, “They stay up all night working. They’re young people and they’re just doing it.... They’re all heart.”
The Satellite Sentinel Project, founded in 2010, uses satellites to capture images of areas in Sudan where humanitarian violations may occur. Students working at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative analyze the data that the satellite cameras collect and that workers in Sudan communicate.
The combination of human reports and photographic evidence lets Harvard analysts “see beyond a shadow of a doubt what is happening” in troubled regions, said  Benjamin I. Davies, the deputy director of operations for the satellite program.
Analysis compiled by Harvard students has been cited in the U.S. Senate and British Parliament and published by media outlets on multiple continents.
“Seeing that my work can impact policy is extremely fulfilling,” said Jody P. Heck ’14, a member of the analysis team. “It’s exciting to go to work every day knowing that I have an effect.”
Furthermore, the vital information makes its way to the Sudanese people.“One of our biggest fans is Sudan,” Davies said. “One time, we issued a report about a city that was about to be invaded, and the radios picked it up within hours. This led to the evacuation of 15,000 people out of a city that was about to be attacked.”
Satellite technology, unprecedented in the field of humanitarian aid, has been key to the project’s prominent accomplishments. “We are the only people who are getting great information as well as visuals out to the people,” Davies said. The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative addresses a variety of global problems through hands-on research.
“It’s a credit to Harvard that HHI is here and pushing the limits of what is possible,” Davies said. “People come from all over with special skill sets, young people who have driven this product from day one.”
Heck added, “People who care so much about the work make for an awesome environment. I’m a statistics concentrator, and it’s great to apply what I’m studying on a day-to-day basis while playing on the same team as people like George Clooney.”
Clooney, an actor who starred in films including “Ocean’s 11,” “Up in the Air,” and “The Descendants,” was arrested two days after his testimony while protesting at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C. He was released several hours later after paying a $100 fine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 55 Harvard students were briefly placed in custody by Israeli security personnel last week, students involved in the incident and a diplomatic representative disputed the border police’s reported reason for detaining the students’ bus.
The students were detained Tuesday during a trip organized by students at the Harvard Kennedy School to al-Walaja, a Palestinian town in the West Bank. Shireen Al-Araj, the students’ guide and a coordinator of an organization in al-Walaja that protests Israel’s construction of a security wall in the West Bank, was arrested and then released soon afterward, according to several trip participants.
According to travelers, the police who boarded the students’ bus said that their vehicle was on a restricted military road. But many participants said that they did not notice any official signs in the area.
“The road we were on was not a designated military zone, nor was it restricted—yet authorities claimed it was,” said Atul Bhattarai ’14, a traveler on the bus. “When asked, they couldn’t provide proof.”
A representative of the Quartet on the Middle East, an international diplomatic entity that is comprised of the United Nations, European Union, United States, and Russia and is headed by Tony Blair, echoed students’ claims that they were not on a restricted military road.“
I am very surprised that [the Harvard] group had an incident at Al Wallajeh yesterday,” Tim Williams, a Quartet adviser for movement and access, wrote in an email sent to trip participants. “I have taken many visitors there on behalf of this office, and I know of others who take visitors there regularly and I have not heard of an incident like this before.”
Israeli authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
“Right after the incident, trek participants were uncomfortable with what happened and [were] concerned about whether or not we had done anything illegal,” said Eliza M. Nguyen ’14, a Crimson news editor.
A trip organizer claimed that other cars on the road were not removed from the area. The organizer, a Palestinian teaching fellow at Harvard, did not travel on the trip and asked to remain anonymous to avoid trouble with authorities when he returns home to Palestine.
Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison said in an email that he understood that the students were detained because they had taken photographs of restricted areas without authorization.
No charges were levied against anyone involved in the Harvard trip.
Kennedy School students organized the trip to show students a Palestinian perspective—a goal that participants mentioned when speculating about the cause of the incident.
“This just highlights how arbitrary and restrictive the Israeli military can be on no particular grounds,” Bhattarai said. “The place we were at didn’t have any military restrictions, but they imposed an ‘impromptu’ rule just to get us out of an area that has Palestinians that suffered particular injustice.”

Harvard College’s Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson will move to Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y., to take over as dean of the College there in June, according to a statement on Monday by Colgate President Jeffrey Herbst.
“Suzy brings an important set of skills and experiences to Colgate,” Herbst said in a press release announcing her appointment.
Nelson came to Harvard as associate dean of residential life in 2005. She was appointed dean of student life in 2007.
In her current role, Nelson has overseen programs including student organizations, the Women’s Center, offerings for BGLTQ students, and public service initiatives for the past five years.
Her work at Colgate will focus on many of the same themes of residential life, inclusion, and service.
“Suzy will play a vital role in fostering a rich set of living experiences, promoting discussions across differences, developing service opportunities, and helping to ensure that Colgate students live vibrant and healthy lives,” Herbst added.
In the Colgate press release, Nelson cited both personal and professional reasons for accepting the new position.
“Given Colgate’s proven reputation as an exceptional liberal arts college, with an enriching and complementary student life program, I am eager to embrace this new professional opportunity,” she said.
She added that she and her family will return to upstate New York, where she, her husband, and her four children “have roots.”
Nelson, who earned her Ph.D. in higher education administration at Syracuse University and her undergraduate degree at the State University of New York at Potsdam, has previously worked as an administrator at Syracuse, Cornell University, and Siena College—all in New York—as well as Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
Prior to that, she taught English in two New York school districts, according to the Colgate press release.

The membership of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents many of the employees at the Harvard Club of Boston, ratified its contract with the Club last week with over 95 percent member approval, Local 26 President Brian Lang said.
The Union Bargaining Committee and Club management reached an agreement on the contract on March 9, approximately 10 months after contract negotiations began.
“The agreement is a very good agreement,” Lang said. “The Harvard Club finally stepped up to the plate.”
The Harvard Club of Boston is not associated with Harvard University, but is open to Harvard graduates and graduates of “selected affiliate colleges and universities,” according to its website. A spokesperson for the Club did not return a request for comment.
Lang said that the new contract’s most important points include a distinction between casual workers and regular employees, a “fair and objective system for employees to advance” regarding seniority, and “good immigration language.”
The agreement included a new health care plan with lower co-payments and no reductions in holidays or sick leave for current employees, according to a summary of the contract released by the union.
Lang, union representative Dana Simon, and Harvard Club front desk staffer Emilio Guerra said that the agreement was in part a result of the workers uniting in the fight for a contract that they perceived as fair.
“They [Harvard Club management] can see that we are more united as a group of employees,” Guerra said. “That is important for us and for any company.”
Lang said that the contract negotiations have been “particularly challenging” for the workers and the Club, with the contract’s new health care plan being one of the biggest sticking points.
“There’s been a lot of twists and turns,” Lang said.
Last October, the National Labor Relations Board cited the Club for negotiating “in bad faith” with its staff, and the union had planned and canceled pickets outside the club over the past few weeks.
In addition, the union complained to the NLRB that the Club had been threatening workers and conducting illegal surveillance to prevent their participation with the union. The wait staff has sued club management, claiming that it charged patrons a gratuity fee that was not passed along to its workers.
Lang said that now, however, he has to commend the Club for agreeing to a good contract.
“At the end of the day, we’ve all come together and we’re moving forward,” Lang said. “You won’t find a stronger promoter of the Harvard Club than the union.”
William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement who interned with the union over the summer and observed some of its negotiations with the Club, said that he reacted with joy when he heard about the new contract and was happy for the workers that an agreement had finally been reached.
“It’s about time,” Whitham said. “This struggle had gone on for long enough, and now it’s over. It just goes to show what kind of impact worker collaboration can have.”

Valerie H. Weiss began a degree program at Harvard Medical School—and ended up as a film writer and a director.
But Weiss’s first feature film, entitled “Losing Control,” brings her back to the lab. A romantic comedy, the film tracks the story of a female scientist determined to use scientific methods on her love life to discern whether her boyfriend who has recently proposed to her is "The One."
“Losing Control” has been screened at thirty film festivals. It will open in New York this week and in the Kendall Square Cinema on April 6.
Weiss said she decided to write the screenplay while pursuing a doctorate in biophysics at Harvard, drawing inspiration from the quirky professors and fellow students that she met while completing her degree.
Weiss said that she hopes the film will provide an authentic portrayal of the lives of young, female scientists—a group which is often represented by narrow stereotypes, she said.
For example, Weiss said she has occasionally has gone clubbing with a friend to pass the time between setting up her experiments and collecting the results.
“People need to see this experience of women and how hard we work, but also how feminine female scientists can be,” she said. “We had very active social lives. I think people don’t really see scientists like that, especially women scientists.”
Weiss said she hopes that the film’s more well-rounded—but comical—representation of women in science will attract more people to pursue a career in science.
Throughout her time at the Medical School, Weiss said she took copious notes with a film about a female scientist in mind. “I had notes on scraps of Kimwipes and on paper towels, and whenever something would happen, I’d write it down on graph paper or whatever was in front of me,” Weiss said.
Weiss said that she sees a strong creative connection between artistic and scientific pursuits. “Everything in science is extremely creative because you’re exploring new territories and art is the same way,” Weiss said.
After receiving her masters degree from the Medical School and a Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Weiss headed to LA where she participated in the American Film Institute’s Directing Workshop for Women and the AFI Catalyst Workshop, a program focused on addressing the country’s need for more scientists and engineers by including science in films in an effort to inspire audiences to pursue science as a career.
Though Weiss had no formal training in filmmaking, she minored in theater as an undergraduate at Princeton and actively promoted filmmaking at Dudley House, serving as the Filmmaker-in-Residence and Film Festival Director for the Dudley program through 2003, according to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. She also founded the Dudley House Film Festival in 1999.
When film studios expressed interest in her film on the condition that she significantly alter the screenplay, Weiss said she decided to stay true to her original vision and pursue the film independently.
According to Weiss, she cut the budget to less than 10 percent of her initial estimate, raised all of the necessary funds in a month, and enlisted a team of professionals and amateurs to help in the production process. Some members of the cast and production staff are also graduates or affiliates of Harvard.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 20, 2012
Due to an error in a press release, an earlier verison of this article incorrectly stated that Valerie H. Weiss received a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School. In fact,  she received a masters degree from the Medical School and a Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Annmarie E. Ryu ’13 first spotted a large, green, spiky object at a marketplace in India, she was unsure whether it was animal, vegetable, or mineral.
The vendor informed her that it was a jackfruit—the largest tree-growing fruit in the world. Ryu decided to try it.
“It was literally the most delicious thing I’d ever tasted,” she said.
That experience inspired Ryu to found Global Village Fruits, a business importing jackfruit to the United States. The company will receive its first shipment in the coming weeks, and jackfruit will be available on the shelves of Boston stores early next month.
Ryu describes the fruit’s flavor as a mix between pineapple, mango, and banana. Her company will import dried jackfruit, jackfruit powder, and jackfruit seed.
Ryu has reached out to a number of specialty food stores in the Boston area, including Whole Foods Market and Broadway Market.
Jackfruit is a novelty to the United States but unexceptional in India. By some estimates, 75 percent of the jackfruit in the country goes to waste every year. Ryu hopes to use her business as a way to raise awareness about the plight of Indian jackfruit farmers, who boast large harvests but meager financial profits from the fruit.
While Ryu sources her product from a cooperative that is among the best in India, many rural jackfruit farmers do not have the infrastructure to produce a high-quality product.
“One group that I visited multiple times works in a two-room rented space where the bathroom has been converted to a cooking space and the equipment is all just pots and pans­—the most low-tech thing ever,” Ryu said. “They don’t even make enough money from their jackfruit product to do that as their main thing.”
With more money, Ryu said, such businesses could improve their production materials and achieve a higher-quality product that can be sold to bigger retailers.
Ryu hopes to one day use a portion of the profits from Global Village Fruits to support jackfruit farmers in India.
Broadway Market manager Richard V. Sabounjian said that after Ryu approached him with her business, he was drawn by both the company’s product and its social entrepreneurial goals.
“I think it’s a good cause,” Saboujian said. “If it doesn’t go, it doesn’t go. But it’s worth a try. And I think it will take off.”
Broadway Market plans to begin stocking dried jackfruit in the beginning of April for fewer than 5 dollars a bag.
Ryu said that while some people might be hesitant to try the exotic fruit, jackfruit’s distinct and “delicious” flavor, as well as its health benefits, make it a snack “worth trying.” Jackfruit is high in magnesium, potassium, and fiber.
“This product is also helping people in India,” Ryu said. “By buying this product you are supporting farmers’ livelihoods and helping small businesses become self-sustaining.”

Along with rising temperatures and the sudden appearance of flip-flops and shorts, spring brings new menu items to the dining halls drawn from student suggestions and seasonal product offerings.
The new additions include two new Make-Your-Own stations. On Mondays, dining halls will offer an Asian-influenced Chop Chop Salad; Thursdays will feature a Crispy Fish Taco Bar.
Each season, the Harvard University Dining Services switches some of its menu options to “take advantage of ingredients growing locally,” and offer a seasonally-appropriate spread, according to HUDS’ online blog.
Other new spring items include a homemade fish cake recipe that uses local whitefish and a homemade chicken salad recipe. There will also be new frozen yogurt flavors—cookies and cream, yellow cake batter, creamy chocolate, and banana cream pie.
“I liked that they had orange slices in the salad,” Charlotte Chang ’14 said. “I think just having new items gives you a sense of freshness.”
The Fruit Bar on Tuesday night will remain, as many people responded positively to its addition in a HUDS satisfaction survey, HUDS said on its blog.
“I liked the fruit bar. I would like to see some fresh strawberries and some other berries like blackberries and raspberries,” Ashley Dozier ’14 said.
Friday nights will continue to feature global cuisine. For example, this Friday dining halls will provide a French-themed meal. Future Friday night offerings will include Vietnamese, Mediterranean, and Thai food.
Paul G. Gardner ’12-13 said he noticed an eggplant dish that he guessed was a new addition and thought that it was “really good.”
In the HUDS survey, students indicated that they liked special pre-assembled salads. In response to the request, HUDS will now offer a Levantine salad called Fattoush on Wednesdays and another salad option on Fridays.
“I think since a lot of people eat three meals in the dining hall every day, some sort of change is necessary because otherwise you get sick of the dining hall food,” Basil J. K. Williams ’14 said.
When Williams was told about the new flavors of frozen yogurt, he declared it “the best day ever.”
Not all students have picked up on the new changes to the menu yet.
“I kind of did notice something, but I didn’t know what it was,” Scout K. O’Beirne ’15 said.
This spring will also bring a host of special dinners, including Yardfest specials in mid-April, Earth Day dinner on April 19,
Richardson’s Ice Cream Sundae Bash on May 3, and a Top Chef competition hosted by the Foot Literacy Project.

Although inclement weather forced two cancellations, the Harvard softball team (10-4) went 2-1 in the San Diego State University Tournament, taking down the host, San Diego State, and Long Beach State.
The tournament, which was played on Thursday and Friday, came on the heels of the Northridge Classic, where the Crimson went 5-0. Harvard’s only loss in the SDSU Tournament came against the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, which defeated the Crimson in a decisive 7-2 match.
Rain on Saturday prevented Harvard from competing in its final two games, slated to be against California State University-Bakersfield and the University of San Diego.
HARVARD 3, LONG BEACH STATE 0
After suffering its first loss in two weeks, Harvard turned its ship around quickly by registering a shutout win over Long Beach State on Friday afternoon.
Co-captain Rachel Brown helped the Crimson get back to its winning ways by pitching a complete game shutout, surrendering only four hits.
“It’s really important that we bounced back so quickly,” Brown said. “It takes a lot of focus and a lot of regrouping for the team to get in a different mindset and really flush the first game out of our minds and get ready for the next game. We had good energy despite this being something like the 10th game of the week.”
On offense, junior centerfielder Stephanie Regan contributed two runs in the victorious effort, driving one in on a double and also scoring herself after another double. The back-to-back doubles came after going hitless in her first two at-bats and 0-for-1 in the first game of the day.
UNLV 7, HARVARD 2
The Crimson’s seven-game winning streak came to an end early on Friday against UNLV (14-12) as it fell to the Running Rebels, 7-2.
After two innings of scoreless action, UNLV jumped out to a 5-0 lead on four third-inning hits before Harvard sophomore pitcher Laura Ricciardone was pulled for the day.
Following two more Rebel runs, a home run by sophomore Kasey Lange narrowed the gap to 7-2, but the Crimson was unable to get any closer. Lange and senior Jane Alexander were the only two Harvard batters to record hits in the contest, though they combined for a total of five.
“Our bats didn’t wake up [Friday] morning as well as they had been, and their pitcher was on,” Regan said. “Other than that, UNLV just was hot bats.”
The loss was the Crimson’s first since March 4.
“We kind of hit a lull,” Brown said. “Maybe we just expected the win and expected things to go our way.”
HARVARD 9, SAN DIEGO STATE 3
On Thursday, Harvard came out swinging in its game against the hosts, posting its second-highest offensive output of the season, with seven different players recording hits. The win, following a sweep at the Northridge Classic, was the Crimson’s seventh in a row.
The game got off to a rocky start for Harvard. Aztec first baseman Justeen Maeva hit a solo home run in the first inning to give her team an early lift—only the second time this season that an opponent has been the first to score against the Crimson.
Harvard was not able to answer until the third inning, but it responded in a big way.
In the top of the frame, the Crimson loaded the bases, and Lange—Harvard’s RBI leader—brought Regan, sophomore Shelbi Olson, and junior Ashley Heritage home on a bomb to center field. Lange was able to score on the play thanks to a cutoff error by San Diego State. Freshman Camilla Gibson was the fifth Crimson player to score in the third inning after she was driven in on a single by classmate Katherine Lantz.
Harvard struck again in the fourth inning, when Regan doubled to left field and was brought in by an RBI single from Alexander.
Thanks to Brown’s pitching performance, the Aztecs did not score again until the sixth inning, when they recorded a pair of unearned runs off two Crimson errors. Despite the blip, Harvard was able to hold off the comeback effort from San Diego, prevailing 6-3.
“San Diego State is a powerhouse that we’ve always struggled against,” Regan said. “We’ve played them every year and had always been just short, but this year our offense came on first. That was big for us to win and get some momentum going into the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the weekend, the Harvard track and field team kicked off its 2012 outdoor season in the Lone Star State at the Texas Southern Relays in Houston. Both the men’s and women’s squads had a number of strong outings, including some event wins and personal-best performances.
“It was a great trip overall,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We got in some fantastic training, and I was really pleased with how our student-athletes went out and competed for us.”
On the women’s side, freshman Gabrielle Scott began her first collegiate outdoor season with a bang. The rookie earned second place in the 400m dash with a time of 56.17 seconds. Scott fell only to Prairie View’s Terracia Moody, whom she edged in the preliminaries by nearly half a second.
“I was trying to really get out in the first 200,” Scott said. “I ended up going about a second faster in the first 200 than I was supposed to, and I held it pretty well, so that was an accomplishment.”
But Scott wasn’t finished after her impressive performance in the 400. The first-year ran a leg of the 1600m sprint medley for the Crimson along with classmate Erika Veidis and seniors Shannon Conway and Meghan Looney. The medley team won the race, finishing in 4:01.00, just 0.02 seconds shy of the all-time school record.
“Everybody went out and ran a really strong leg, especially our anchor, Meg Looney,” Scott said. “She came back from third place and helped us get the win.”
Another freshman, middle distance runner Molly Renfer, also made her presence felt over the weekend. The rookie ran her way to the 800m title, finishing in 2:13.39, more than two seconds faster than her nearest opponent.
Away from the track, Harvard’s field athletes continued the success they enjoyed during the indoor season.
Junior Sydney Leroy tied the outdoor school record in the pole vault, clearing 3.80 meters for second place. Sophomore Allie Pace, who holds the indoor school record in the event, had a clearance of 3.65 meters to finish in third place.
“We have a great pole vault crew,” Saretsky said. “I was particularly happy for Sydney, who matched the school record. Now both she and her training partner have their names up on the record board, which is fantastic.”
Senior Shannon Watt also turned in a solid performance over the weekend. Watt threw 46.38 meters in the discus to win the event. The mark was just over a meter short of her personal-best throw, which is the third farthest in Crimson history.
On the men’s side, freshman thrower Ben Glauser had the performance of the weekend for Harvard, capturing two event titles. The rookie’s throw of 17.04 meters in the shot put outdistanced the second-place finisher by nearly half a meter.
Glauser earned his second win at the invitational with a hammer throw of 54.22 meters.
“[The throwers] are definitely a talented bunch,” Saretsky said. “[Throwing coach Cathrine Erickson] does a great job with their training regimen. She’s continually pushing them to get most out of themselves.”
Coming off indoor Ivy championships in their respective events, sophomore sprinter Damani Wilson and junior pole vaulter Nico Weiler showed that they can be just as competitive outdoors.
Wilson, who is also a member of the Harvard football team, ran the 100-meter dash in 10.92 seconds, which was good for second place at the meet. Wilson fell only to Texas Southern’s Justin Anderson, who cruised to first with a time of 10.79 seconds.
Weiler also earned a second-place finish by clearing 5.05 meters in the pole vault. Seth Arnold, a member of the USA All-Stars, finished in first place with a clearance of 5.20 meters.
The trip to Texas has been an annual tradition for the Crimson for roughly 30 years. The squad stays with host families for the duration of its time in the Lone Star State, and trains using the athletic facilities at Rice University.
“[The trip] is a fantastic tradition,” Saretsky said. “Even though this winter has been a bit of an exception, it gives us a great opportunity to get in some warm-weather training.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the NCAA Wrestling Championships from March 15 to 17 in St. Louis, Mo., the Harvard wrestling team experienced emotions on both sides of the spectrum.
On the one hand, junior Steven Keith, who was ranked No. 11 at the 133-pound weight class, defeated the sixth-ranked grappler on the first day of competition before finishing in eighth place to merit All-American honors.
No. 4-ranked junior co-captain Walter Peppelman, meanwhile, lost his first contest of the tournament but won four straight matches in the Wrestlebacks before falling to No. 6-ranked James Fleming in the 157-pound weight class. That performance also led to an eighth-place finish and his second All-American honors.
While unranked co-captain Corey Jantzen, who was sidelined most of the season due to injury, upset No. 10 Cam Tessari of Ohio State University to open up the tournament, subsequent losses to the No. 7- and No. 4-ranked opponents kept Jantzen off of the podium.
The Crimson’s final grappler, freshman James Fox, did not win a match in the 197-pound class, but he wrestled two close matches that proved him worthy of his at-large bid.
As a team, Harvard went 9-10 for the tournament, landing the team in 30th place out of 64 colleges with 17.0 points.
Jantzen went 1-2 over the three days, and his shoulder injury proved problematic. Though he didn’t place in the tournament, the senior left his imprint.
“[Jantzen] is one of the most talented people I’ve ever met—works his ass off,” Keith said. “It’s unfortunate that he never had a full season without injuries, but he’s someone I look up to, and I know he’s a little disappointed, but he’s impacted the wrestling world in a way that he doesn’t realize.”
Fox wrestled in two tight matches in his first NCAA tournament, losing to the No. 8 seed, 12-8, before falling, 4-1, in the first round of the Wrestlebacks.
“Just being a freshman, he didn’t quite have the experience under his belt, but he’ll be back, and he’ll do well,” Keith said.
“I think, after a good summer, a couple more months training, and getting used to college wresting, he’s going to do really well next year,” Peppelman agreed. “He showed a lot of promise.”
Keith began with a pigtail match against Geoffrey Alexander from the University of Maryland, whom he defeated, 8-0, and then went on to get the decisions over University of Oklahoma’s Jordan Keller and No. 6 Devin Carter from Virginia Tech, 8-4 and 8-6, respectively.
The upset over Carter was a milestone for Keith and epitomized his success in the tournament.
“[Keith] probably wrestled the best match of his career against Devin Carter,” Peppelman said. “Carter is a very tough wrester, and Steven just dominated him from start to finish. He really wrestled a fabulous tournament.”
In the quarterfinals, Keith’s hopes at a national championship were dashed when he was pinned by No. 3 Tony Ramos from the University of Iowa at 1:37.
In his first match in the Wrestlebacks, Keith had the 5-3 decision over University of Central Michigan’s Zach Horan, but he was pinned in his next contest by Chris Dardanes from the University of Minnesota at 7:48 to send him to the seventh-place match.
In a tight battle between Keith and No. 8 Zachery Stevens, Stevens managed to get the upper hand in a 13-11 final that placed Keith in eighth.
Nevertheless, Keith’s finish earned him All-American honors for the first time in his career.
“I’m never really satisfied,” Keith said. “I would have liked to place higher, but becoming an All-American was one of my goals, so I’m pretty pleased with that.”
Harvard’s other All-American was Peppelman, but Peppelman’s road was different than Keith’s. Peppelman was upset in his first match of the NCAA tournament by unranked David Bonin from the University of Northern Iowa, who got the fall at 2:55. He then won four straight matches in the Wrestlebacks—three decisions and a pin at 2:29—before Fleming got the major decision, 9-0.
Peppelman’s final contest of the year came against No. 11 James Green from the University of Nebraska. The junior was unable to come out on top and lost the match, 9-1.
“I didn’t wrestle my best,” Peppelman said. “But I got the job done, which is what matters. Obviously I don’t feel like I wrestled up to my potential, but I wrestled good enough, so I’m very happy about that.”
Keith had much admiration for his co-captain, who notched All-American status for the second year in a row.
“Being a two-time All-American is not something that not many people can say,” Keith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite being first to light up the scoreboard in five of its last six matchups, the Crimson failed to pick up its second win of the year in the latter two-thirds of its spring-break road trip.
Harvard (1-12) took on Bethune-Cookman (9-9, MEAC 1-2) in a three-game series Tuesday through Thursday in Daytona Beach, Fla., where the Crimson lost, 8-7, 11-2, and 6-4.
Harvard then headed further south to Orlando, Fla., for the weekend to face off against No. 19 Central Florida (16-5) in another three-game series. But the home team got the sweep once again as Harvard fell in close decisions, 4-3, 4-2, 6-5.
“Obviously it’s tough to lose there, but we did a lot of good things,” senior Jeff Reynolds said. “We know ourselves as a baseball team a lot better.”
Though the outcome may not suggest it, the Crimson managed to outhit its opponents in five of the six games. The offensive success marked a welcome departure from last season for Harvard, when it struggled to get consistent hitting from much of the lineup.
“We definitely swung the bats pretty well, but we’re struggling to string hits together,” Reynolds said.
Sophomore Steve Dill, who is currently leading the Crimson with a .382 average, had nine hits in the six-game stretch, while classmate Carlton Bailey added seven more. Rookies Zach Boden and Mike Martin contributed an additional eight and six, respectively.
“A lot of underclassmen were really stepping up for us, which is great because we’re really going to need them come the next few weeks,” senior pitcher Brent Suter said.
Although Harvard took several positives out of the weekend, the team faltered on defense in both series, racking up a total of 13 errors. Those mistakes, along with several errant pitches, cost the Crimson precious runs, often allowing its opponents to stage late comebacks.
NO. 19 CENTRAL FLORIDA 6, HARVARD 5
After taking down then-No. 19 Stetson on March 11, Harvard looked as though it was poised to take down Central Florida, the new owner of the No. 19 ranking, on Sunday afternoon. But a late surge by the Knights handed the Crimson its sixth loss in as many days.
Harvard gained momentum from Dill and Bailey—who went 4-for-4 and 2-for-3, respectively—to jump out to an early 4-0 lead by the end of the second inning. But later, four walks, two errors, and one hit batter gave Central Florida the opportunity to get back into the game.
“As a pitching staff, we had too many walks, myself included,” Suter said. “We were consistently missing way too far and hitting guys, so we really need to minimize those mistakes.”
The Knights capitalized with three runs in the sixth and two runs in the seventh, claiming the lead and eventually the win.
CENTRAL FLORIDA 4, HARVARD 2
Although two hits barely sounds like enough to get a runner across home plate, it was all Central Florida needed to sneak past the Crimson in the second game of the teams’ series. In fact, with all four of their runs unearned, the Knights might not have needed any.
Central Florida captured a three-run lead on Harvard errors by the end of the second frame and kept the Crimson bats quiet other than a pair of hits by Boden and Reynolds.
Sophomore hurler Baron Davis came in as relief for junior Joey Novak, but the efforts were too little, too late as the Knights closed out the win.
CENTRAL FLORIDA 4, HARVARD 3
With late comebacks and close finishes beginning to haunt Harvard’s spring-break roadtrip, Friday’s game against Central Florida did nothing to break the pattern.
The Crimson once again outhit its opponent, and Suter struck out five batters, but Harvard pitching and fielding errors in the bottom of the eighth helped the Knights score two runs and earn the win.
“We’re out there playing some pretty good teams, and we’re really giving them a fight,” Reynolds said. “Playing competition like that can only help us…. And we know what we need to improve on.”
BETHUNE-COOKMAN 6, HARVARD 4
On Thursday, the Harvard squad saw a similar story unfold. The Crimson looked as though it was going to leave the Wildcats’ home turf with a win under its belt, but the home team once again rallied in the bottom of the eighth to capture the lead.
Bethune-Cookman had notched one run in three of the first four innings, but RBIs from Crimson sophomore Jake McGuiggan and senior J.T. Tomes tied things up for Harvard in the top of the fifth.
Sophomore Jeff Hajdin scored an unearned run off a Wildcat error in the top of the eighth, but the Crimson followed with three errors of its own, giving Bethune-Cookman three unearned runs and the victory.
“Those errors really cost us towards the end,” Suter said. “I think we definitely could’ve gotten several wins out of spring break, but we only have one to show for it.”
BETHUNE-COOKMAN 11, HARVARD 2
In the second game between Harvard and the Wildcats, the home team saw huge performances from much of its lineup, wracking up a total of 15 hits and nearly as many runs.
The Crimson jumped out to 2-0 lead in the second, but Bethune-Cookman quickly took the lead in the bottom of the frame and built it up over the next five innings despite the efforts of Harvard’s pitching staff, including junior captain Andrew Ferreira, who struck out six batters in only five innings of play.
BETHUNE-COOKMAN 8, HARVARD 7
In a manner that would prevail for the rest of the trip, the Crimson put the Wildcats in an early deficit in the teams’ first matchup last Tuesday.
Harvard put together 18 hits on the day, but Bethune-Cookman scored seven unanswered runs to negate the Crimson’s early lead and ultimately capture the one-run victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only two hours of rest between the semifinal and final, the Harvard men’s tennis team (13-1) dug deep to win the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic at the Hogan Tennis Center in San Diego, Calif. on Thursday and Friday.
The victory puts the Crimson on a strong path going into the heart of its spring season.
“We have a lot of confidence moving forward, especially playing outdoors, as a result of this week,” Felton said. “The matches have been tough, and it has been a great learning experience and will help in the Ivy League matches.”
HARVARD 4, NO. 16 UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO 2
Though originally scheduled for Saturday, the final against the University of San Diego was moved up to Friday evening due to the weather, forcing the team to play almost 10 hours of tennis.
“We were relieved after the semi-final, and we left the premises right away to get food,” freshman Denis Nguyen said. “We were able to soak in the win for an hour. We regrouped, refocused, and warmed up again. It was tough.”
Barring a tie, the six singles matches were set to determine the winner of the tournament. The first four matches were split two each for the Crimson and the Toreros. Senior Jonathan Pearlman and Denis Nguyen lost at No. 1 and No. 2, dropping their matches in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2 and 6-3, 6-4, respectively.
But sophomore No. 3 Christo Schultz and freshmen No. 4 Shaun Chadhuri evened out the score for Harvard.  Schultz beat sophomore Clarke Spinosa 6-2, 7-6, while Chadhuri won against junior Thibaut Visy, 6-3, 6-4.
With the score tied, freshmen No. 5 Alex Steinroder and No. 6 Henry Steer took to the courts. Steer dominated his match, sweeping freshman Andrew Carlisle, 6-0, 6-0.
Determining whether or not doubles play would be necessary as a tiebreaker, the finals came down to the three-set match between Steinroder and freshman Ciaran Fitzgerald. Steinroder took the first set in a convincing fashion, 6-0. But Fitzgerald came back to take the second set, 6-4. In the decisive final set, Steinroder outplayed his counterpart in a tight 6-4 set to win the championship for the team.
“The win against San Diego in the final is one of the most amazing Harvard tennis performances in a long time,” senior captain Alistair Felton said. “We played well against a great team on their home court. It was astonishing that we won—a Herculean effort from the team.”
HARVARD 4, SAN DIEGO STATE 3
In order to clinch the berth to the championship match, the Crimson needed to win a do-or-die doubles match in its semifinal clash with San Diego State. With the score tied at three matches each, Harvard’s doubles duo of Schultz and Pearlman avenged their earlier singles losses to win in a tiebreaker over the Aztecs’ Rickey Baylon and Spencer Simon.
“Luckily, Christo and Pearlman pulled it out,” Nguyen said. “They were down in the tiebreak and had to fight back and stay in the match. They stayed mentally tough. Hats off to them. It came down to one point—that’s how close it was.”
To reach this point, however, Harvard and San Diego State battled back and forth in the eight other matches. The contest began with singles play, with the doubles point deciding the match in the event of a tie.
In the first completed matches of the day, Chadhuri and Denis Nguyen put the Crimson in great position by dominating their matches, 6-2, 6-0 and 6-2, 6-2, respectively.
But the Aztecs came surging back to level the score 2-2. Harvard No. 3 Schultz lost his first match of the season to Thorston Bertsch, 6-4, 7-5. Following shortly after, No. 5 Steinroder fell to Hunter Nichols 6-2, 6-2.
Though there seemed to be a change in momentum in San Diego State’s favor, No. 6 Steer defeated Baylon rather easily, by a score of 6-1, 6-2, giving the Crimson the advantage. But after a very tightly contested match, the Aztecs’ Javier Pulgo beat No. 1 Pearlman 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (3), to force doubles play.
Fortunately for Harvard, the No. 1 tandem of sophomore Casey MacMaster and Felton won the first doubles match, 8-4, over Pulgar and Nichols.
But San Diego State didn’t count itself out yet. Harvard’s No. 2 team of junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen faltered in a close match against Bertesch and Derek Siddiqui, 9-8 (7).
Completely tied up, Schultz and Pearlman took the court. The duo sealed the deal for the Crimson, 9-8 (8), earning Harvard the decisive doubles point and giving it the chance to fight for the championship later that day.
HARVARD 6, UC IRVINE 1
In the first round of the tournament, the Crimson started off with doubles play against the University of California-Irvine.
The No. 1 duo of MacMaster and Felton showed determination by closing out a tight match against Anteater senior Fabian Matthews and freshman Jacob Jung, 9-7.
The No. 2 doubles pair of Schultz and Pearlman notched another victory for Harvard with a fairly easy win, 8-5, over the UC Irvine counterparts, clinching the doubles point for the Crimson.
In singles play, Harvard showed its strength by winning five of the six matches. The only blemish on the Crimson’s record was a tight three-set loss at No. 4 singles. Steinroder dropped his match, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to senior Jon Kazarian.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team split its matches against University of Iowa and University of Central Florida in Orlando, Fla., this weekend.
In its first away contest in five matches, the Crimson began Saturday with a 5-2 victory over the Hawkeyes, but its four-game winning streak came to an end Sunday afternoon when the Knights beat Harvard by the same score, 5-2.
Doubles play continued to be a strong point for the Crimson, which took both doubles points in its two matches.
Junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana was the only player to win each of her singles matches, but senior Samantha Gridley, sophomore Natalie Blosser, and sophomore Hannah Morrill all posted at least one win on the weekend.
CENTRAL FLORIDA 5, HARVARD 2
After scoring the initial doubles point, Harvard was outmatched in singles play and lost on five of the six courts to lose the contest, 5-2.
“I think we all set the point really well but we just couldn’t put it away,” Norton said. “We have to give UCF credit because they just came out ready to win and they played really well.”
Though the overall score was lopsided, the teams were evenly matched, with three singles matches spilling over into third sets and two of the remaining three going into extra games within a set.
Doubles competition was just as close. At the No. 1 position, Tachibana and fellow junior co-captain Kristin Norton dropped their match, 9-8 (7-5), but Morrill and freshman partner Kelly Whelan defeated the Knight’s Alexis Rodriguez and Jenna Doerfler by the same tiebreaker, 9-8 (7-5). The No. 3 spot did not go into extra sets, but the tally was close nonetheless, with the duo of Gridley and Blosser coming out on top, 8-6.
With Harvard leading 1-0, UCF made its comeback by winning its matches on the No. 2 through No. 6 courts.
Playing as No. 2, Norton fell to Genevieve Lorbergs by a score of 6-3, 7-6 (8-6). In another extra-games match, Doerfler defeated Gridley, 7-5, 6-3, at the No. 3 position. The Knights’ third team point came from Josephine Haraldson, who beat Whelan on the No. 5 court, 6-4, 6-2.
The remaining three head-to-head matchups took three sets to decide the winners.
UCF’s Courtney Griffith took down Morrill, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, playing at the No. 6 position. Blosser began her match strong, winning the first set, 6-4, but her opponent recovered and the sophomore ended up losing, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4.
Tachibana kept the Knights from sweeping singles play. She defeated her foe, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, at the No. 1 spot.
“Anything can happen on any given day, and it just didn’t go our way [on Sunday],” Norton said. “But after the match we figured out the differences that we could have made to come out with the win instead of a loss. We really identified the little things that we can improve before April when our Ivy matches come up.”
HARVARD 5, IOWA 2
On Saturday, in its first contest of the weekend, the Crimson continued its four-game winning streak with a 5-2 victory over the University of Iowa at the UCF Tennis Complex in Orlando, Fla.
Harvard first notched the doubles point, winning two of three contests. Norton and Tachibana handled their doubles opponent, 8-3, while Morrill and Whelan fell to their foe, 8-6. With the doubles point on the line, Blosser and freshman Sylvia Li battled their opponent into a tiebreaker, eventually coming out victorious with a final score of 9-8 (8-6).
The Crimson then took four of the singles matches to seal the win. Tachibana beat the Hawkeyes’ Shelby Talcott, 6-2, 6-2, at the No. 2 court, while Gridley overcame her foe, 6-2, 5-7 (10-3) at the No. 3 position.
Harvard’s other two wins came from a 6-4, 6-4 bout by Blosser and a 6-3, 6-3 win by Morrill at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots, respectively.
Though Norton dropped her contest at the top position, 6-3, 6-2, and Whelan, playing No. 4, lost, 6-4, 6-4, the Crimson came out victorious.
“We really thought that our hard work from the week paid off,” Norton said. “The win was really a team effort, and I was really proud of our team that day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard women’s water polo team’s annual spring break trip to California served as a homecoming for more than half of the squad, it was not an entirely joyous occasion for the Golden State natives, as the team went 1-4 for the week.
Despite the losing record, the scores of the games, two of which were against top-20 teams, demonstrated the team’s strong progress.
“We played [UC] Santa Barbara really closely and UC Irvine really closely,” co-captain Devan Kennifer said. “We played our hearts out.... Hopefully, that attitude will carry into our East Coast play. The East Coast teams aren’t nearly as hyped up, so hopefully we can get that advantage over them now that we’ve played on the West Coast.”
NO. 6 UC IRVINE 15, HARVARD 8
The Crimson (9-9, 1-1 CWPA Southern) stuck with the Anteaters (17-5) for most of their game, bringing the score within two goals at the end of the third. But Harvard could not manage to hold on in the final frame and allowed eight Irvine goals in just a few minutes.
“Our game against Irvine was a breaking point actually,” said Kennifer, who led the team in goals with a hat trick. “We were a lot more mobile than we had been in the past. By changing up our style of play, [they] didn’t know what to expect.”
Harvard’s defense shined throughout the first three quarters, thanks in large part to the play of freshman goalie Ariel Dukes, who tallied 13 saves.
Harvard knotted the score at three as late as the start of the second half.
CAL BAPTIST 12, HARVARD 10
On Saturday morning, in one of many close games for the week, the Crimson helped establish a name for East Coast water polo against one of California’s top teams.
Six Harvard players scored, with junior attacker Aisha Price leading the squad with four goals.
In her dominant middle quarters, Price helped the Crimson engineer a large comeback and take a 9-8 lead early in the fourth.
But Harvard struggled to seal the deal. The Crimson fell apart in the closing quarter as Cal Baptist (14-8) went on a 4-0 run to bring its total to 12 goals.
LONG BEACH STATE 10, HARVARD 5
Harvard suffered arguably its toughest loss of the weekend on Friday, falling by the second widest margin of the trip to one of the week’s lowest ranked teams.
Both squads traded goals in the first frame, tying the score at two going into the second quarter. But that was the last time the score would remain close.
Long Beach State (8-10) shut out the Crimson for the remainder of the second frame, and the 49ers offense held strong as it continued to pull away in the second half.
HARVARD 15, WHITTIER 4
Harvard earned its sole taste of victory during the week on Monday, routing Whittier (9-10) in a decisive 15-4 win.
Following a slow first quarter for both sides, the Crimson finally began to pick it up by the second quarter and built up the score from a 1-1 tie to a 5-2 lead by halftime.
Harvard continued to pull away in the second half, scoring 10 more goals.
Ten players saw the back of the net in yet another showing of the depth of the Crimson’s roster.
NO. 16 UC SANTA BARBARA 10, HARVARD 9
Harvard proved its worth in its debut California game on March 11, dropping its game against UC Santa Barbara (14-10) by one goal.
The Gauchos shut out the Crimson in the first quarter, climbing to a quick and early 3-0 lead.
But rather than turn over and take a beating from a top-ranked water polo powerhouse, Harvard responded with a 3-0 run of its own in the proceeding quarter, even knotting the score, 4-4, by halftime.
UCSB again went on a 3-0 run to launch the second half, but this time, it was too much for the Crimson to overcome.
Harvard battled back throughout the remainder of the half but was unable to reclaim any sort of lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though warm weather has apparently already arrived up here in Cambridge, the Harvard men’s golf team traveled down to Florida for spring break in preparation for the upcoming spring season.
And after a week of practice, the Crimson faced Ivy League rival Cornell in its first match of the spring season. On a slightly overcast Sunday morning, Harvard defeated the Big Red, 7-1, in an exhibition match at the Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Fla.
Unlike most matches, which aggregate the top scores from each team to determine the winner, Sunday's contest featured head-to-head matchups in which the low shooter in each pairing earned a point for his squad.
“Overall it was a good match,” sophomore Theo Lederhausen said. “We all played well, and we’re very happy with it, and we’re very confident going forward.”
After only beating Cornell by three strokes last October in the Philadelphia Big 5 Invitational, the Crimson had somewhat of an advantage this time around, as the Big Red had only just arrived in Florida for its spring break trip.
Harvard managed to take the top four matches of the day, with senior Mark Pollack, Lederhausen, captain Tony Grillo, and freshman Akash Mirchandani all topping their Cornell opponent.
“We played a beautiful course; it was really hard,” Lederhausen said. “I putted really well and hit a lot of good shots, so it was really good to start the year off playing a good round.”
Sophomore Seiji Liu dropped his match in the fifth spot, but sophomore Michael Lai won as the sixth seed. Sophomore Kevin McCarthy played both in the seventh and eighth spots, winning both.
With a week of practice under its belt—in addition to earlier practice thanks to fortunate weather up north—the Crimson feels well prepared heading into the major part of the season later in April.
“We had a lot of good practice because we are at good facility, PGA National,” Harvard coach Jim Burke said. “We had a great trip, the guys are playing well, and we got a lot of good work done on the spring trip.”
“We feel like we are ready to go, and we are excited for our upcoming tournaments in a few weekends,” Lederhausen added.
