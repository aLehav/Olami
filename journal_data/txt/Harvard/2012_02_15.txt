After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s get something straight: Harvard is not a public institution and it does not exist to provide jobs. While no organization should layoff employees without reason, Harvard is under no moral or legal obligation to keep positions simply because they currently exist. While I sympathize with the individuals who lose their jobs from layoffs, an employment system where positions cannot be eliminated once created is a dangerous path towards unsustainable organizational design and financial instability that will inevitably cause more damage and pain than the purposeful layoff of employees.
Change is a necessary and beneficial part of any organization. Sometimes change requires an organization to hire new employees, but sometimes change requires fewer employees. In part because of its ineptitude for internal communications and public relations, Harvard predictably received a swift negative response to downsizing announcements. Claims are made that Harvard “owes” some nebulous category—the individuals laid off, the local community, the City of Cambridge, the State of Massachusetts—a certain number of jobs, but Harvard exists to provide education, not employment. While such education could not be provided without employing many people, preventing Harvard from laying off employees would likely result in a smaller workforce in the long run. If Harvard were never allowed to reduce its workforce, the university would consequently be more hesitant to hire new employees whenever a need arose, since any new employees would essentially have tenure.
The notion that Harvard owes the City of Cambridge a certain number of jobs is absolutely absurd. Harvard is the largest employer in Cambridge and, aside from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the remaining top 10 employers have almost an order of magnitude fewer employees. As Harvard grows, the number of people it employs will grow, but saddling the University with the burden of not being able to layoff employs will only slow or reverse the rate of growth. Furthermore, Harvard’s presence is responsible for attracting many firms and industries to the Cambridge area. Harvard’s operational spending contributes significantly to the revenue of many businesses that provide employment locally, not to mention the sizeable portion of the Cambridge economy driven by the tourism (and parking ticket revenue) that Harvard attracts. What Cambridge and Massachusetts lose in tax revenue from Harvard’s nonprofit status, they more than make up for in the economic activity Harvard provides.
The argument is commonly made that Harvard should keep jobs simply because it can afford to provide them with its $32 billion endowment, but this claim only displays an ignorance of the University’s funding structure. First, the endowment is not one consolidated fund that the central administration can allocate accordingly. Harvard is (in)famous for its “every tub on its own bottom” funding structure, and funds from any one independent unit within the University—be it a school, department, House—are not accessible to any other unit. Second, even if the money were accessible, much of it comes from donations, which are oftentimes tied to a specific use and cannot be used for anything other than that purpose. If an alumnus provided a contribution for Harvard to buy more comfortable toilet paper, the amount would show up in the University endowment but it would not be able to support employment or payroll costs. Third, even if the money were accessible and unrestricted, donors often specify that Harvard can only use a certain percentage of the interest earned by investing the donation and never spend down the principle itself. If Harvard wanted to spend $32 billion to buy, say, Princeton and Stanford, it would not be able to do so since it could only spend the interest earned on a sizeable percentage of endowment funds. Harvard cannot simply cover employment costs by shrinking its endowment and, even if that were possible, doing so would be irresponsible since a growing endowment provides Harvard the ability to provide more jobs in the future.
While Harvard is not breaching any moral standard by laying off employees, none of this is to say that layoffs should be the first step in cost-cutting measures. When layoffs are made, they should be communicated unambiguously, and it should be clear where layoffs fall within the prioritization of budget cuts. Perhaps there are other areas where Harvard could find less painful and less education-impacting cuts. Perhaps the growth of some segments of the University, such as the number and scope of deans, is disproportionate to staff reductions in other areas. Many arguments can be made about when and where layoffs are appropriate relative to other alternatives. However, at the end of the day, Harvard can and should be able to lay off employees when it has a legitimate reason to do so. Harvard is a private institution, and the number of employees it chooses to have is a matter of neither public policy nor popular consensus. Harvard is not the Works Progress Administration.

The inaugural Sex Week at Harvard, a week of programming that is interdisciplinary, thought-provoking, scholastic, innovative, and applicable to student experiences of sex and sexuality from March 25-31, draws ever-closer. As the founders of Sex Week, we think now might be the time to revisit the rest of the lyrics of the Salt-n-Pepa song “Let’s Talk About Sex.” Who knew that, for instance, the next lines are “Let’s talk about you and me/ Let’s talk about all the good things/ And the bad things/ That may be?”
Just like the provocative hook of Salt-n-Pepa’s song is catchier than the rest of its content, so too is it possible to focus on the “Sex” part of Sex Week at Harvard without examining what the Week is really about. For us, Sex Week is not just about sex: It is about discourse as much as it is about intercourse. Harvard students are having sex, it’s true. Harvard students are also not having sex and choosing to be abstinent for a set period of time or until we enter into a lifetime commitment such as marriage. And, most significantly, Harvard students are already engaging in discussions about love, sex, sexuality, and relationships. These discussions may take place on HarvardFML, between friends, at the freshman dating event put on by the Center for Wellness and the Freshman Dean’s Office, or during section for Literature and Sexuality, Human Sexuality, or one of the other General Education classes that attracts students with the word “sex” in the title.
In fact, Harvard has a long history of talking about sex. In 1913, Harvard’s President Charles Eliot aided in the founding of the American Social Hygiene Association, an organization intended to fight the spread of venereal disease through sexual health education. A 1952 article in the Crimson advocating a sex education class on campus reminds us, “after all, just because a man has a Harvard education, he has no inherent gifts that enable him to negotiate sex and marriage alone.” As recently as 2002, Science B-29: “Evolution of Human Nature” (no longer being offered) was known colloquially as just “Sex.”
The problem may be, then, where, when, with whom, and in what contexts these conversations are happening. It has been our experience that dialogues about love, sex, and dating can end up being more like monologues, or conversations specific to a particular group or community, rather than applying broadly across campus. The Harvard community holds incredibly diverse values on, beliefs about, and approaches to love, sex, and sexuality. As evidenced by the plethora of media coverage on the “hostile sexual climate” at Yale, sex and sexuality remain pertinent topics of discussion on college campuses. Sex Week was started in order to engage with these contemporaneous issues. We have much to learn about ourselves and each other by talking about love and sex with mutual respect and eagerness to understand the views and experiences of others.
Indeed, our goals in planning Sex Week draw directly upon the mission of Harvard College itself. Harvard College “strives to create knowledge, to open the minds of students to that knowledge, and to enable students to take best advantage of their educational opportunities…. to rejoice in discovery and in critical thought; to pursue excellence in the spirit of productive cooperation.” Seeking inspiration from this call for students to come together and create the educational opportunities that are pertinent to our lives, the mission statement of Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College has similar aspirations: “SHEATH aims to unite diverse members of Harvard’s community...to promote open, honest, holistic, culturally competent, and inclusive sexual health education and discussion.” We believe that examining “common human experiences with love, sex, sexuality, and relationships” are vital to any education.
This vision requires being constantly attentive to the needs, desires, and wishes of the greater Harvard community. In planning the first-ever Sex Week, we have started conversations with a number of students and student leaders in organizations as diverse as the Harvard Environmental Action Coalition, True Love Revolution, Harvard Men Against Rape, Delta Gamma, Fuerza Latina, Harvard College Faith and Action, the Harvard Graduate Council, the Radcliffe Union of Students, and the Queer Students and Allies. To connect students to the resources that are already available to them, we have united with peer counseling groups and various Harvard offices, including Contact Peer Counseling, the Center for Wellness, the Harvard Foundation, the Office of Career Services, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and the Harvard College Women’s Center. We have solicited critical feedback and continue to do our utmost to address, as preached in “Let’s Talk About Sex,” “the good things and the bad things that may be” during Sex Week.
These conversations should be not a one-time occurrence but continuous. We can always do a better job, and there’s always more to discuss. Our hope is that individual students will know where all available resources are located and that their worries, insecurities, and questions about sex and sexuality will be answered to suit their needs and concerns without judgment.
So, Harvard: Let’s talk about sex, baby, let’s talk about you and me.

At this university, most debates about reproductive morality center on abortion, so the furor last week regarding whether Catholic universities and hospitals needed to cover contraception in employee heath care plans may seem a more foreign concern.  However, the debate illustrates an important clash between liberal and religious ethics over the scope of the state’s power.
Briefly, the Obama administration at first refused Catholic universities and hospitals an exemption from the policy that requires health care providers to include access to reproductive planning services including contraception, sterilization, and the emergency contraceptive Plan B. As the president of the University of Notre Dame, John I. Jenkins, pointed out this September, the Catholic Church opposes contraception, and thus the policy compels Catholic organizations “to either pay for contraception and sterilization in violation of the Church’s moral teaching, or to discontinue our employee and student health care plans.” Jenkins asked that exemptions be provided beyond those organizations “that primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets” to include ones like Notre Dame, which “shares common religious bonds and convictions with a church.” In doing so, Jenkins suggested that such an exception would “protect the conscience” of those who work for universities like Notre Dame and believe contraception use is wrong. Yet this discussion of conscience versus government regulation ignored the reason that the government issued the contraception mandate in the first place—the rights of the women whose contraception is on the line.
These women have rights and liberties that the government must defend. Those affected by Notre Dame’s health care policy range from professors to students to dining hall workers, and although many of them are Catholic like the university that educates and employs them, many are not. Furthermore, despite the Catholic Church’s ban on contraception, 98 percent of American Catholic women use some form of contraception—about the same rate as other women. Many women who work for Notre Dame thus use or will wish to use birth control, which is often prohibitively expensive. As one Harvard student told me recently, “My father is a deacon of an evangelical Christian church, and I knew that if anything ever showed up on insurance for contraception, I would be disowned. I decided to go to Planned Parenthood and was absolutely surprised when the nurse told me that my bill for a fifteen-minute appointment and thirty pills was $130. With $145 to my name, I had to choose two of the three: have sex, not get pregnant, or have more than $15 to your name. I chose not getting pregnant.” Birth control can at times be so expensive that allowing anti-contraceptive modification of a health plan would prevent some women from receiving birth control.
The women who work for Notre Dame have the right to the full health care plan afforded to women elsewhere in the United States—to equal access to the same benefits regardless of the views of their employer. This right necessarily begins beyond those organizations “that primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets” because only organizations with such specific membership criteria can presume that their members will agree to renounce contraceptives. The difference between organizations that primarily serve those with the same religious beliefs and those that are simply affiliated with a church is that it can be reasonably inferred that members of the former kind (for example, nuns or missionaries, as the language of the government decision suggests) personally reject contraceptives. Institutions that are simply affiliated with a church cannot ensure the same. Nuns may reasonably be expected to not need contraception because of the conditions under which they join their sisterhood, but college students and janitorial staff are not implicitly held to reproductive choices because of their membership in a religious university, nor should they be.
The Obama administration’s efforts to ensure women’s access to contraceptives originally forced some health care holders to pay for contraceptives they deemed immoral. Obama’s eventual concession, which gives women access to contraception at the insurance companies’ cost rather than the cost of the insurance pool, protects the freedom of conscience of Americans who believe that contraception is wrong by exempting religious organizations from paying for contraceptives. The recent concession does as much as possible to protect individuals from financing what they consider immoral while defending the right of all women to the same health insurance regardless of their employer’s religious views. Ultimately, the contraception mandate is not so much government interference with religious values as it is a legitimate protection of workers and students who would otherwise face discrimination based on the views of others members of their insurance pool. Individuals should at times have a “conscience clause” that exempts them from participation in government programs, but not at the price of denying access to others who have not committed to the same religious conscience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anger brewed in Copley Square this Monday as hundreds of citizens gathered at a public hearing to protest looming fare hikes and service cuts on the part of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In a move that many have decried as unfair, the MBTA plans to drastically raise prices and cut service in order to achieve financial stability. Although the painful fare increases are necessary to prevent a dire situation from worsening, we should bear in mind that a large part of the T’s debt is a direct result of the Big Dig project. We believe that the T should be allowed to operate on its own, without having to take responsibility for the mismanagement of others. By absorbing the Big Dig debt that the T unjustly shoulders, state authorities could mitigate the harmful impact of current public transportation restructuring plans on Boston’s residents.
The MBTA is currently saddled with a debt of $5.5 billion and faces a deficit of $161 million. About a third of this debt is the legacy of costs associated with the Big Dig project, incurred to fund expansion efforts that mitigated the negative environmental impact of the development. As the Big Dig primarily benefited commuters from well-to-do suburban areas, it is unfair that Boston’s urban residents—many of them impoverished—must shoulder part of the cost. If the state were to assume this part of the T’s debt, it would provide significant relief for the system’s financial situation. Not only would the overall debt load be slashed, but so would the deficit, as interest payments decreased.
A structural deficit and a lack of revenue are still serious issues, ones the T needs to address. However, it seems to be going about this in a manner that is alarmingly shortsighted. To provide just one example, under current plans, parking fares at public transportation hubs are set to increase by up to 28 percent, while regular subway fares would do so 35 percent or more. This arrangement seems to favor commuters over people who live in the city. Presumably, the average commuter is able to stomach fare increases more than the average inner city dweller. Thus, this arrangement should be reversed.
In addition, financial solutions for the T need not come solely from fare increases or service cuts. One innovative solution would be to introduce a congestion charge for driving in the city center, similar to the one London already has in place. Revenue from this measure could be used to fund the subway and bus systems. The overall effort should be one of redistribution from those able to afford increases to those who will struggle to do so. Another solution would be to redirect revenue temporarily from toll roads, which is currently restricted to use on tolled assets only. This could serve as a short-term solution until the MBTA is able to stand on its own once more.
While the city’s residents are entitled to feel dismay at the pending changes in the T, they would do well to bear in mind that Boston’s transportation system is among the least expensive of its kind. New York City, for instance, charges $2.25 per subway ride; in London, the fares are even higher. Although the T’s service is arguably worse than that provided in other cities, this is partly a result of its relatively low charges. Fare increases, coupled with a brighter fiscal outlook, could pave the way for a better T service. One place to start would be to extend the subway system’s hours of operation, which severely restrict late-night transportation options.
Although the T needs to solve its fiscal woes, its debt stems at least in part from past mismanagement, and should be addressed accordingly. The current plan to endow the MBTA with financial stability will unfairly affect lower income communities. The proposal should be amended to spare the needy as much suffering as possible. We envision a T that is financially independent and capable of equitably providing Boston’s citizens with better service—a T that the city can be proud of and that it deserves.

I am extraordinarily excited for Feb. 15.
Feb. 15, for the uninitiated, is SLABentine’s Day, a soon-to-be national holiday. This day is set aside to celebrate SLABs everywhere, people who self-identify as “Single, Lonely, And Bitter” (concept conceived by esteemed SLABs, Jacob and Rachel; motto: “Hell is other people”). A group of us, all single or nearly, are going to march into a French-ish restaurant, brandishing Groupon discounts, and eat all the crème brûlée we want. We will be in our sartorial finest, and we will be class acts. Who knows how much rosé we will have drunk before dinner? How many of those heart-shaped chalk candies and how many gourmet truffles we will have consumed? At the very least, we know we will be rolling down the seasonal aisle of our local CVS (“V” for value!) first thing in the morning. We will feel, among us, so much amour.
I admit I’m a recent convert, initially reluctant about the seemingly defensive, rah-rah Girl Power angle many female-targeted articles take to make loveless women feel better about themselves. (Girl, it’s not you, it’s consumerism and society and men everywhere. You? You keep doin’ yo’ thang.) Yet, these articles miss an important point: it’s often so great to be alone in general, not just romantically unattached.
My first year of being genuinely single in college is great: I’m always miraculously free at the same time as myself; my solo date ideas never fail to fly with those involved. There’s something inevitable and perverse about the way Harvard life distills all commitments, be they obligatory or recreational, perfunctorily dull or emotionally intense, into tastefully de-saturated rectangles on my Google calendar. Or maybe, I admit, I was just doing it wrong.
I’ve found that, here, solitary time—scheduled or not—is wholly underrated. Why would you just hang out with yourself when you could be listening to famous people talk, when you could be engaging with your fellow brilliant minds of tomorrow? Why bother spending downtime with yourself, when you could be getting ahead on next month’s psets, when you could be sleeping? (Granted, the latter is indeed a tantalizing alternative.)
I guess there’s some sort of stigma attached to being seen alone on campus. I often feel a sort of guilt when I choose to eat meals by myself, a guilt that I seem asocial and perhaps also a fear that I seem not worth befriending. As a result, I read a lot more of The Crimson and HUDS announcements than I otherwise would. Perhaps that is why you’re reading this very piece at this very moment.
Last month I went to the movies by myself for the very first time. I decided at 9:55 p.m. that I had a terrible craving for movie theater popcorn and jumped on the quad shuttle to catch the last showing of the night. I guess “The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo” wasn’t an optimal date movie anyway, but it was so freeing to decide to go on a whim, all by myself, unencumbered by friends’ slow responses and general inertia. And no one I cared about was there to listen to me crunch my popcorn or contest my monopoly on both armrests. For once, I didn’t feel obligated to make conversation at the first step out of the theater; I didn’t feel required to immediately find a verdict on the film. I emerged from the theater to one of this winter’s first snows, and all was quiet under the orange night sky as I walked back on even, piss-free snow. I felt kind of like how Liz Salander does at the end of the film, wistful, at peace, and alone but exquisitely. I had a great night, and I don’t really wish you were there.
All that being said, I do want to make it clear that I wouldn’t exactly be outraged if somebody, you know, felt like inquiring as to whether or not I were free for dinner or drinks or something. But you should probably also know that you’re up against some pretty attractive plans I’ve made for myself and just myself. Happy SLABentine’s Day, that is, to you and perhaps just you!

Nearly a year after the death of Peter J. Gomes, the search for a spiritual leader to fill his position at Memorial Church is still many months away from its conclusion.
The search committee that University President Drew G. Faust appointed to consider candidates for the position of Pusey Minister has been meeting since last spring. The group plans to fill the position no earlier than the start of the next school year, according to committee member Benjamin C. Greenberg.
“I would like to see a person in place by the time the next academic year starts, but if that’s not possible, then it’s not possible,” said Greenberg, an Orthodox rabbinic adviser at Harvard Hillel.
He added, “This position is, with no exaggeration, one of the most prestigious positions within this line of work in all of North America. We’re not going to rush the decision.”
The 19-member search committee includes, among others, three reverends, a professor of Islamic religion and culture, four Harvard Divinity School professors, a music professor, three lawyers, and two undergraduates.
Greenberg emphasized the importance of the diverse search committee to selecting a minister who can serve the campus and the broader community.
“The candidate must be a person whom a student feels comfortable going to when they have a deep philosophical or theological quandary—someone who exists in between worlds, interfacing with the faculty, the administration, the students, and the parishioners,” Greenberg said.
While the names of candidates under consideration for the position have not been released, Greenberg said that the committee is evaluating candidates both within and beyond the Harvard community.
Gomes left an indelible imprint at Memorial Church, Greenberg said, and the committee hopes to find a minister who can follow in his footsteps.
“Peter Gomes was a tremendous person, a real iconoclast in the Harvard community,” Greenberg added. “We are not looking for the next Peter Gomes because there will never be another Peter Gomes.”

Economics professor Nathan J. Nunn, whose research focuses on developmental economics and economic history, earned tenure last month.
Though an offer of tenure usually ensures that a faculty member will remain at Harvard for many years, Nunn’s future at Harvard is uncertain as he has also been offered a tenured position at Stanford University.
“I was pleased,” Nunn said about his offer from Harvard.
Nunn, a native Canadian who received his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 2005, said that both Stanford and Harvard are “fantastic places” and he will accept the offer from the university he feels offers the best research environment.
Nunn is one of three young professors in the economics department to receive an offer of tenure in recent years.
“In terms of internal promotions, that’s a little bit of a boom,” Department Chair John Y. Campbell said about the recent promotion of junior faculty members.
Nunn began teaching at Harvard as an assistant professor in July 2007.
“Harvard was too good of an opportunity to pass up,” said Nunn, who is also a faculty research fellow for the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Nunn’s research focuses on the long-term economic effects of the African slave trade.
Nunn currently teaches an undergraduate course titled “Poverty and Development” as well as graduate courses and seminars about economic history.
Nunn said that he was attracted to the theory of economic development because he often wondered “why some areas are more prosperous than others.”
After taking an undergraduate level course with Nunn, Manning Ding ’12, an economics concentrator and inactive Crimson news editor, asked him to advise her thesis and enrolled in his graduate level class.
Ding said that Nunn inspires his students “to think about academia and economic development.”
“He’s not only a brilliant researcher but also someone you can talk to,” she added.
Ding said that Nunn, with his ability to connect with students, is an asset to the Harvard community.
“He’s definitely great to have around Harvard,” she  said. “I hope he will stay at Harvard so that many more students will have the opportunity to benefit from his invaluable mentorship.”

With planning for resuming development in Allston underway, Harvard asked for resident support and participation in selecting a developer for the proposed Barry’s Corner residential commons and retail center at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Monday evening. But community members expressed apprehensions about the University’s proposal, explaining that they felt Harvard failed to adequately address the question of what type of tenants will reside in the building.
Residents at the meeting were mainly concerned that Harvard will use the new housing in Barry’s Corner primarily to house graduate students.
“We  don’t want a dorm,” Task Force member and Allston resident Ray Mellone said during the meeting.
Mellone later said that the University’s inability to provide specifics on the kind of residents it will seek for the new housing center undermined its claim that it is dedicated to ensuring residents feel “comfortable” with the new project.
“If they want to be open and clear about it, they have to give us more than just the barest bone,” Mellone said. “If they’re going have a building and they don’t know who they’re going to put in it, it’s unclear whether those tenants will be in line with the goals of the community.”
In a 2005 planning document, Harvard laid out a vision for a “main street” on Western Ave., Lower Allston’s main throughway. Barry’s Corner is located at the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave.
But relations between Harvard and Allston residents grew tense when the University placed this vision on hold and halted construction in Dec. 2009 after the economic recession dealt a significant blow to its endowment.
In Sept. 2011, the Harvard Corporation and University President Drew G. Faust approved recommendations for the University’s path forward in Allston that the Harvard Allston Work Team developed in the year and a half following the construction halt. Since then, Harvard has begun planning for resuming large-scale development in the neighborhood across the Charles.
During the meeting, a Harvard administrator assured residents that the housing development would not serve as an undergraduate dorm and said that their goal moving forward was to pursue a project that the “community can feel comfortable with”.
“The intent of these meetings is to engage the Task Force so we can get feedback from you as to what matters to you as a community,” University vice president of communications and public affairs Kevin Casey said at the meeting.
Despite Casey’s assurances, some residents said that the University’s vague language was a tactic to evade committing to building housing that would be open to the larger community as well as Harvard affiliates. According to Task-Force member Brent Whelan ’73, residents are not against any Harvard affiliates moving into the building, but would prefer faculty members and their families rather than graduate students.
“We want professors, etc. who would integrate with their community,” Whelan said. “Graduate students don’t integrate with their community, they integrate with their library.”
Task Force member Paul Berkeley said that the University’s discussion of the design of the building seemed to indicate already that the University will not target the kind of tenants Allston residents would hope for.
“The University was describing one and two bedroom units,” he said. “Anyone who has had kids knows that two bedrooms is kind of small for a family.”
Nevertheless, Berkeley said that the neighborhood might welcome the construction of such apartment units if they are available to individuals who are not necessarily members of the Harvard community.
“It wouldn’t be a bad thing if people in the Allston neighborhood could find a place to live where they grew up while they begin to build a life after school,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the young wizards and witches at Hogwarts are sorted into four different houses, they have the opportunity to tell the magical Sorting Hat which houses they prefer.
At Harvard, the sorting process is not so lenient.
Once the dust settles on the random lottery that distributes Harvard freshmen among twelve Houses—which vary widely in location, architecture, and tradition—some students are inevitably dissatisfied.
Some grow to love the communities they were upset to hear on Housing Day that they would be joining. Others, while less enthusiastic about their Houses, grin and bear it for three years. But after a year or more in their assigned Houses, some want to jump ship.
Upperclassmen have the option of applying to transfer to a different House. The process has strict limitations, and students who choose to transfer often feel torn between a location that suits their lives and a group of friends who reside in their first House. After transferring, though, students almost unanimously say they are happier in the House they chose themselves.
HOPPING HOUSES
The objective of interhouse transfer, according to Mather House Master Michael D. Rosengarten, is to help students enhance their educational or social experiences.
“The process is all about making students happy,” Rosengarten says.
The application requires students to choose their primary reason for requesting to transfer from choices such as “be closer to Harvard Square” or “desire a different room configuration.”
But the reasons that students give have little bearing on the outcome of their petitions to transfer. The first round of the interhouse transfer process, which is conducted in February, is entirely random in order to align with the philosophy of the freshman lottery, says Sophia R. Chaknis, director of residential programs and operations in the Office of Student Life.
To be eligible for an interhouse transfer, a student must have completed at least two terms in his or her current House. There are two rounds of interhouse transfers each fall and spring.
Though freshmen can enter the housing lottery with a blocking group of up to seven friends, a House transfer applicant can switch with only one other person.
GOING THE DISTANCE
Of the nicknames Emily S. Unger ’13 has accumulated over the years, the one that makes her chuckle every time is “Traitor.”
“People from my old House tease me by saying, ‘Oh, you are a traitor,’” Unger says. “Joking aside, I don’t think they actually judge me for transferring to a different House.”
Unger, a former Currierite, transferred to Quincy after her sophomore year, since, as she says, “the Quad was very far from everything.”
Unger says she spends most of her time at Hillel, sandwiched between Lowell and Quincy.
“Being close to Hillel was my priority,” she says.
Like Unger, Rachel E. Zax ’12 is active in the Hillel community and decided to transfer from Pforzheimer to a River House because she found the commute to be a hassle. An observant Jew, Zax does not ride the shuttle on the Sabbath. She says she worried about her safety walking home at nights and on winter days.
Of the six River Houses she listed as options on her transfer application, Zax says she was placed in the one she named as her top choice, Adams.
“I was really hoping to get Adams because it has the best location,” she says.
Some students do move in the other direction, though, from the River to the Quad.
Andrea R. Rivera ’13 says she gets a lot of curious looks when she tells acquaintances that she transferred from Mather to Currier.
“I just wanted to live with a different group of friends,” she says.
Although Rivera initially wanted to transfer to Quincy with a friend in Currier, she says her friend “loved Currier too much and didn’t want to leave.”
Rivera admits that she initially felt scared thinking about living in the far-away Quad.
“But it was worth it, thinking that my room would be bigger and I would be living with people I really enjoy seeing,” she says.
A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME
Some students look to transfer Houses because they do not feel comfortable, either physically or socially, in the first Houses they land in.
One student, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid offending residents of his first House, transferred to a House within the same River neighborhood because, he says, “my rooming sucked.”
He recalls, “The room was overheated, so I could barely sleep at night.”
He says he also disliked the House’s architecture and the food in its dining hall.
Though he misses his blockmates, he says, transferring to a different House has improved his Harvard experience.
Elaine D. Kim ’13 says she and her blockmates were apathetic when they were greeted by bunnies on Housing Day.
“Leverett is neither the best nor the worst House,” she says.
After living there for a year, Kim says she did not feel like a part of the House community. She decided to transfer. In ranking her choices, Kim says she considered factors including location, community, and rooms.
Shortly after, she received an email welcoming her to Kirkland. “The rooms in Kirkland are small, but it has a great community,” Kim says. “Leverett just wasn’t for me, and I am having a better experience in Kirkland.”
SECOND TIME AROUND
Each House sets a cap each year on the number of transfer students it accepts based on the space available in the House, according to Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67.
“It is a two-way street with many unpredictable variables. Depending on how many new students Harvard sends us, how many transfers out [of the House] there are or leaves taken—spaces pop up for student transfers,” Palfrey says.
Alexa I. Stern ’12 and Joshua R. Wortzel ’13 were not so lucky on their first attempts to transfer Houses.
Wortzel’s blockmates were all women, and after a year in a single in Pforzheimer, he wanted to move to Lowell to room with a friend there.
When his first-round application was rejected, he talked to the resident dean of Lowell, who recommended that he apply again in the second round.
Likewise, Stern was the only woman in her blocking group. She submitted a transfer application from Currier to Leverett as a sophomore so she could live with a group of women in Leverett. When she found out her application had been rejected, she says she was “devastated.”
“I never thought about what I would do if I didn’t get out of Currier,” she says.
But she had a second chance. She describes the process, “The first round is pure lottery, whereas the second round takes into account special consideration, such as whether you are fit for the house.”
Before the freshman lottery was randomized in the mid-1990s, students who wanted to transfer Houses had to “directly petition the Master of the House into which they hope to move,” according to a Crimson article from 1984.Today, neither the resident dean nor the House masters have any say in interhouse transfer decisions.
“We don’t make the decision based on whether we like you or not, but whether we have the space availability for transfer,” Palfrey says.
Nonetheless, Stern says she approached the Leverett resident dean to tell her that she was eating in Leverett at least once a day, sneaking into community dinner, and staying over in a friend’s room in Leverett on some weekends.
Stern’s determination paid off. Near the end of her sophomore summer, Stern received an email from the Office of Student Life saying she would be living in Leverett the following year.
“Now that I am in a House that I like, it just made my Harvard experience so much better,” Stern says.
Wortzel also heard the good news over the summer that his application to Lowell had been accepted.
“Having a roommate for me was the best thing, because being in a single can be lonely,” Wortzel says. “There is nothing I don’t like about Lowell.”
SHATTERED BLOCKS
The College restricts transfers in part because free transfer among Houses might disrupt the communal atmosphere of a House.
“We try very hard, as House Masters, to develop community, and it becomes much more difficult if the tides flow too strongly in and out,” Palfrey says. “You don’t want people to be hopping Houses.”
Students also feel that the tug of personal ties constrains their decisions to move to new Houses.
Before she decided to transfer, Zax questioned whether the convenience and safety were worth being separated from her blockmates.
Living in a single in Adams, she says she would much rather live with her original blockmates.
“I do miss coming home and having conversations with my roommates,” Zax says. “Now I come home and sit in the room by myself.”
Unger also says it was difficult leaving her blockmates.
“It puts you in a weird situation at Harvard, because you are outside of the Harvard social fabric, the...blocking group,” she says.
Nevertheless, Unger says, “I am definitely happier now that I have transferred. I am very happy here.”

The Unicco Service Company will rehire two custodians formerly employed at Harvard Business School, according to Sarah Betancourt, a spokesperson for Service Employees International Union Local 615, the union which represents both employees.
The two custodians were fired by Unicco last year when the company alleged that their immigration paperwork was out of order. A third worker was fired around the same time for a similar reason but decided to leave permanently, according to Betancourt.
The decision came only a day after a delegation of about 15 people delivered a petition with over 80 worker signatures demanding that the custodians be rehired by the Unicco office at the Business School.
Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, credited the petition for Unicco’s decision.
“We think it’s the right thing to do,” Langley said. “We’re happy that Unicco has made the right decision here. Obviously it was a result of the coverage and the petition and the march on the boss.”
Langley said that the two employees’ paperwork had in fact been mishandled, but neither employee presented any liability for Unicco, which Harvard contracts to provide janitorial services.
“Unicco was within its contractual rights to do this,” Langley said. “For long term employers, you would expect that they would give them the benefit of the doubt. These people are not numbers.”
“We felt like they were being unreasonable,” Langley added.
Unicco representatives did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story. Blanca, one of the rehired employees who asked to be referred to by only her first name, has worked at Harvard College as a Unicco employee for ten years.
Speaking to The Crimson with aid from an SEIU interpreter, Blanca said that she did not turn in her immigration documents to Unicco on time last September.
A single mother with five children, she said that her six-month long unemployment caused her to sink into depression and made day-to-day living very difficult.
“The Unicco labor relations guy said that I quit because I chose to,” she said. “I said, ‘How could I not work? If you don’t work, you don’t eat.’ That’s how you survive.”
The second custodian could not be reached for comment.
Heather S. Vega, an SEIU Local 615 representative and one of the union members who delivered the petition to Unicco’s office on Thursday, said that she saw the pair’s rehiring as inevitable.
“They hadn’t done anything wrong,” Vega said. “We weren’t going to stop putting pressure on [Unicco].”
Blanca said she was grateful to learn of the union’s petition.
“When Heather told me that, I felt like my heart was exploding from my chest,” Blanca said. “I felt that I wasn’t so alone.”
She added that she looks forward to returning to work.
“I can’t lose this job,” she said. “I see my job as an extension of my home. I really want to go back to work.”

CORRECTION: Feb. 18
An earlier version of this article stated that the two employees who were dismissed and then rehired by Unicco were custodians at Harvard Business School. In fact, the two custodians worked at Harvard College.

There has been a slight increase in the number of cases of gastrointestinal illnesses, particularly norovirus, among College students, administrators announced in a campus-wide email on Tuesday.
Commonly called the stomach flu or food poisoning, the highly contagious illness is prevalent during the winter and can be spread through direct contact or ingesting contaminated food or water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website.
It is standard protocol to inform the community in situations when health issues arise “in order to promote health and prevention,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email.
The norovirus incubation period is 24-48 hours, and then the illness typically lasts another 24-48 hours, according to the email from Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh. The email also listed important contacts for those who are already sick and need assistance if they have vomited or cannot leave their rooms.
Brian A. Truong ’15 was sick from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning and said several others in his entryway contracted the virus as well. For Truong, the email was simply a confirmation of his sickness.
“I looked up my symptoms online,” he said. “I pretty much knew what I had.”
Tyler W. Gamble ’14 said that his illness lasted about two to three days, during which he exhibited common symptoms of the stomach flu. Many of his blockmates and entrywaymates have also come down with the illness or are still sick, but he said he does not know how they all contracted the virus.
“We all live in the same tower,” he said. “We eat in the same place; it could have been food. It was just a bunch of people who live in the same area and use the same common spaces.”
According to information released on the University Health Services’ website, shared common spaces can be contaminated easily, and students who live in dorms are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
During his illness, Gamble said he knew he was contagious and took precautions.
“I mostly slept in my room and tried not to infect other people,” he said.
Currier House Resident Dean Laura K. Johnson notified Currier residents of the outbreak on Monday, before the administration’s campus-wide announcement. The email told residents that the House would help excuse sick students from classes, and advised everyone to wash their hands with soap and water rather than using hand sanitizer, especially before eating.
According to the informational pamphlet that UHS distributed, there is no direct treatment—such as a vaccine or drug—for norovirus, but those who are affected should drink fluids to prevent dehydration.

Only in its second year of existence, the biomedical engineering concentration saw a 38 percent growth in the number of sophomore concentrators who declared this fall. This year, 12 seniors, 13 juniors, and 19 sophomores are currently studying under the concentration, according to Harvard College Facebook.
Enrollment in Engineering Sciences 53: “Quantitative Physiology as a Basis for Bioengineering,” the introductory concentration course offered in the fall, increased from 25 students in 2010 to 40 students this school year. Every sophomore who enrolled in ES53 this past fall ended up declaring either an A.B. in Biomedical Engineering or an S.B. in Engineering Sciences on the Bioengineering track.
According to Sujata K. Bhatia, Assistant Director for Undergraduate Studies in Biomedical Engineering, this growth can be attributed to students’ desires to apply design skills to medical problems.
“Students coming to Harvard really do want to change the world around them and there is increasing recognition that engineering teaches the skills that allow students to do exactly that,” said Bhatia.
Introduced in the fall of 2010, the biomedical engineering concentration offers a foundation in the life sciences and the engineering techniques necessary to create innovative solutions to unsolved clinical problems.
“Everything from EKG machines to echocardiograms and the intravenous drugs given to patients—these were all made possible by biomedical engineering,” said Bhatia.
Moreover, according to Bhatia, the career options for biomedical engineering concentrators extend beyond traditional engineering roles.
“Going into medical school, academia, engineering...there’s a whole array of possibilities, which is perfect for someone indecisive like me,” said Eric A. Bersin ’14, who declared biomedical engineering in November.
For many students, the 14 half-course requirement for the biomedical engineering A.B. is a major advantage of the concentration, as the engineering sciences program requires 20 half-courses.
“I wanted a rigourous math and science curriculum, and I also liked the fact that I would have more time to pursue other interests,” said Jake A. Weatherly ’12, who switched into biomedical engineering upon its creation his junior year.
Concentrators also cite the hands-on experience gained in biomedical engineering classes as a factor in their decision to concentrate.
In classes such as Engineering Science 227: “Medical Device Design,” students are paired in teams with surgeons in Boston-area hospitals to develop medical devices.
“I’m really excited with what my team is working on and hope that it will be really beneficial for surgeons in the future,” said Suvai Gunasekaran ’13, a biomedical engineering concentrator who is taking the class this term.
The bioengineering program has introduced a number of initiatives to welcome more students, including monthly socials open to the Harvard community and an annual bioengineering expo presenting student research in April.
For now, current students enjoy the advantages of a small department.
“I have made many of my friends through those long nights in Quincy dining hall working on engineering problem sets,“ said Gunasekaran.
“The professors are eager to share their work and give tours of their labs. My advisor’s been able to spend a lot of time with me,” said Weatherly, “but more concentrators would be great.”

Researchers at the Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recently developed a vaccine for rhesus monkeys that provides immunity against the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a virus found in monkeys that is analogous to HIV.
Rhesus monkeys that received this new vaccine had an 80 percent reduction in their chance of acquiring SIV upon future exposures, according to Dan H. Barouch, the lead author of the study and a professor at Harvard Medical School.
In addition, the monkeys who still contracted an SIV infection after vaccination had a lower SIV viral count in their blood compared to unvaccinated monkeys who acquired an infection.
According to Barouch, this new vaccine is a breakthrough because “three HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in [the past] 30 years—and of those, two failed and one showed only a marginal improvement.”
SIV and HIV vaccines have been difficult to create for years because common methods of vaccine development have proven unsuccessful in providing full effective immunity.
Barouch’s vaccine uses a non-conventional “prime-boost vaccine combination,” which requires the subject to have two injections. Each injection contains a harmless vector virus that safely transports weakened SIV virus particles into rhesus monkey cells. Once transported, these SIV particles then trigger a controlled immune response and allow the subject to develop immunity against future infections.
Barouch said he believes that it is this particular combination of viral vectors that allows protective immunity, in contrast to previous unsuccessful vaccination attempts.
While most vaccine developers work with weaker strains of SIV virus, Barouch said this vaccine was particularly promising because his team was able to develop the vaccine successfully with more potent strains of SIV.
“There are many different SIVs,” Barouch said. “Some are wimpy and some are hot. We used a difficult-to-neutralize strain and got these results.”
While Barouch said he is not yet certain when initial human vaccine trials will begin, he added that he is optimistic for future work.
“This gives two major advances: an understanding of what immune response is or how it is wired for protection, and a human clinical trial option.”

Madison A. Greer ’13 says her dream is to be the next Michael Jackson. On Feb. 28, she might just get that chance.
Greer has been selected as one of three finalists in the annual Harvard ROCKS competition—a singing contest presented by Harvardwood, an artist network whose membership is open to Harvard students, alumni, faculty, and staff.
Kelley N. Purcell ’02, executive director of Harvardwood, said that the competition is meant to promote Harvard-affiliated performers.
“It’s not your average battle of the bands competition,” Purcell said.
For the final round, the contestants must perform live in West Hollywood for a panel including President of Fox Music Robert Kraft, Chief Operating Officer of Live Nation Ben Weeden, and last year’s Harvard ROCKS winner, Rachel A. Brown ’10. The winner will be decided by votes cast at the show and online by ticket-buyers.
Todd A. Forman ’92 and Sara B. Melson ’90 will compete along with Greer in the final round. All three artists said they plan on playing original music for the final performance.
To prepare for the live show, Greer, an English concentrator in Quincy House, said she has been practicing her songs three times a week for three hours.
“It’s me being the performer and the producer and the arranger all in one,” she said.
Greer said that she has always wanted to pursue a career as an artist because her family has a strong musical background.
Greer’s father is a jazz musician, and her mother sings and plays classical piano.
“I’m the girl who always said ‘I want to be a star,’” said Greer. “I have never stopped wanting to do that.”
Greer’s competitors have more than a few years on her and a fair amount of professional music experience.
Forman once played saxophone for Sublime, a ’90s punk band from California. Ultimately, he left behind his musical ambitions to focus on his wife and family, he said.
Forman, who was a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and participated in musical theater while at Harvard, said he has always been passionate about music.
“I wouldn’t say I always wanted to be a professional musician,” said Forman, now a family physician who runs a practice with his mother. “But it has always been a goal of mine to have music be a part of my life.”
Melson chose to pursue acting after college, but she said that her true passion is music.
“I loved acting, but I felt like the things I was doing felt artistically not as inspiring as they could be,” she said. “Spiritually, I had more to say, and I felt like singing might be more of my medium.”
Melson was signed to a record label, but restructuring within the production company led to the cancellation of a publicity campaign for her first album, which was released several years ago.
Melson said Harvard ROCKS will give her another shot to market her music and gain exposure.
Voters are required to purchase a ticket to the final competition or pay the equivalent amount for a ticket online.
The online system is now open, and Greer said she has been encouraging her peers to vote for her.
Greer said she thinks that the ticket price—$6 for Harvardwood members and $8 for non-members—might deter students from voting.
“I’m not going to force people to pay,” she said. “I’m just trying to be as understanding as possible and just asking people to do this favor for me.”
The Harvardwood web site calls the contest’s grand prize, which includes soundtrack consideration from Fox Music and performance consideration from LiveNation, the “ultimate music industry prize package.”
The three artists said they are grateful for the opportunity that Harvard ROCKS has given them.
“It’s a great way to show that Harvard does rock,” Forman said.

University President Drew G. Faust announced the launch of a University-wide contest to encourage student social entrepreneurship in an email to the Harvard community on Wednesday. The President’s Challenge will provide ten student groups with resources to develop solutions to five global issues that will be determined by the University.
“The world’s most pressing problems heed no borders, and to better address them we need to work across boundaries to formulate solutions. I can think of no place better prepared to take on such challenges than Harvard,” Faust said in a statement.
The Challenge, sponsored by Faust and supported by the Harvard Innovation Lab, will give the ten finalist teams $5,000 each to develop their designs.
The University will announce the winner just before Commencement. That group will win research space in the I-Lab through August 2012 and will split a $100,000 prize with two runner-up teams.
Students affiliated with a Harvard graduate or undergraduate program from across the University are eligible to apply.
I-Lab Director Gordon S. Jones emphasized the contest’s educational value as well as the potential impact of the groups’ solutions.
“It’s a chance for students to be putting their own ideas to work and, I think, an opportunity to test those ideas as they develop against the world at large,” said Jones.
The five social problems could range from global warming to poverty and will be selected by a group of Harvard faculty later this month. That same committee will choose the ten finalists—two per issue—in early April.
The competition’s focus on social entrepreneurship and increasing interaction between students at different schools aligns with other recent initiatives at Harvard.
Two years ago the Law School launched the Public Service Venture Fund—a program that provides funding to graduating law students to launch social enterprise projects or pursue public interest careers.
The Business School has hosted an annual Social Enterprise Conference for the past 15 years.
Faust has also put an increased emphasis on public service at Harvard in recent years. Last year, Faust established the Presidential Public Service Fellowships, a grant program that funds ten undergraduates to pursue service projects during the summer.
“All of Harvard’s Schools have powerful programs addressing key social issues,” Dean of the Kennedy School David T. Ellwood ’75, who is also a member of the I-Lab advisory board, said in a statement. “The President’s Challenge gives us a new opportunity to take a University-wide look at critical problems.”

THE NAMEDROP
“Baby, let's light up the town. You provide the spark, I'll provide the Power.”
“Call me Mr. Wright because I know how to finish.”
“Every time I see you, I get Gedeon-side.” (Gedeon is pronounced “giddie-in”)
“The Price is always right.”
“Women's hockey has a home game this Saturday. Our future already's looking Bright.”
“My name may be Colt, but I'm actually a stallion.”
“I can get you into the Kong...without having to wait in line.”
PERSON-SPECIFIC

For those of you riding the Jeremy Lin train (and who isn’t?!), his first four starts have been surprising, amazing, and even inspiring. But his fifth start? Surreal.
Not even the likes of Homer and George Lucas, creators of some of the most famous archetypal heroes, could have scripted Harvard grad Jeremy Lin’s ascent and performance Tuesday night against the Toronto Raptors. Hero rises as the underdog, struggles initially, gets hurt, but ultimately prevails. As cliché as it might sound, that’s exactly how New York Knicks starting point guard Jeremy Lin’s night went.
Lin finished with an impressive stat line of 27 points, 11 assists, two rebounds, and a steal in 43 minutes. But what he, and all basketball fans, will remember most about Tuesday’s game are the last three seconds.  After an offensive rebound gave New York possession with the game tied at 87 with 20 seconds left, the ball went straight to Lin about 40 feet from the basket.  There was never any doubt about who would be taking the last shot as Lin drained the clock to three seconds, crept up to the three-point line, and drilled a 25-foot three pointer right in the face of Raptors guard Jose Calderon. The game-winner capped off a 24-12 fourth quarter in favor of the Knicks, who have now won six in a row with Lin at the helm.
His team down five points with two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Lin was seen going to the sideline to be treated for a bloody cut on his arm following a costly turnover. Whatever they did or said on the sideline must have worked—55 seconds later, Lin drove to the basket and converted an impressive floater over Raptors center Amir Johnson while being fouled and falling to his back.  Lin then hit the pivotal go-ahead free throw. Call it fearlessness or a short-memory, but Lin’s drive to basket ignited the Knicks just in time to pull out the victory.
With his shifty drives, confident shooting, and impressive court vision, Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni seems to have found an aggressive and smart point-guard to lead his high-scoring offense.  At least Spike Lee, who has become the Knicks unofficial mascot, surely thinks so.
@SpikeLee: “When Will The World Understand Jeremy Lin Is A Baller?Is There Still Any Doubt.Da Orange And Blue Are Going For The Ring.Don't Sleep.Ya-Dig?”
But back to reality. The Knicks (14-15) still needed a last second three-pointer to beat the lowly Raptors (9-21), who were missing their 2006 first overall pick and leading scorer Andrea Bargnani. And Lin still needs to improve on ball security (eight turnovers against the Raptors) as well as his 61% free-throw percentage over the past two one-possession games. Lin set the record for most turnovers by a player in his first five starts.
And that comes one day after boxer (and now criminal) Floyd “Money” Mayweather tweeted,
“Jeremy Lin is a good player but all the hype is because he's Asian. Black players do what he does every night and don't get the same praise.”
With all due respect, “Money,” it’s actually because as an undrafted free agent on his third team, Lin set the record Tuesday night for most points scored over a player’s first five career starts in the NBA. And that includes all races.
We can only hope that Lin’s electrifying streak will continue, if not for basketball’s sake then at least to see how many more puns “Linsanity” will create.  But in the end, Spike Lee will always say it best:
@SpikeLee: “Jeremy" I Got Dem Brotha's Stumb-Lin And Bumb-Lin-MUMB-LIN TOO. HEE HEE HEE”

Last night, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams took home six wins and bragging rights, battling Brandeis, Boston College, and MIT at the Malkin Athletic Center and taking home the Beanpot title for the fifth-straight year.
Coming off strong performances at the Ivy League Championship last weekend, the Crimson used a combination of experienced leadership and strong walk-on performances to post its largest series of victories this season and hold on to both the men’s and women’s titles for yet another year.
“It was kind of expected that we would win this competition again this year,” said junior foil specialist Thomas Snell. “The Beanpot is a great competition and an easier competition for us to have right after Ivies. We would have been really disappointed if we had lost any matches here at the Beanpot.”
“It was a good performance by all of our people,” Harvard coach Peter Brand added. “We were resting some of our usual starters who fenced last weekend at Ivies, so this was a good chance for us to give some of our walk-ons a chance to fence, and they all did exceptionally well. I am very happy with the results of both the men and women tonight.”
In the first match of the one-day round-robin style tournament, the No. 3 Harvard men’s fencing team sparred against MIT and soundly defeated its Cambridge rivals, 21-6.
The Crimson followed up its dominant performance against the Engineers with an equally strong victory against Boston College, 20-7. The squad then closed out the tournament against Brandeis and recorded its largest margin of victory of the season, 22-5.
Leading Harvard for the second week in a row was co-captain Valentin Staller, who stood undefeated for the evening, posting an individual record of 9-0. Major contributions from some of the squad’s rookies, including foilist Brian Kaneshige, also keyed the Crimson to victory.
As part of a gradual return to competition, sophomore Lucas Lin earned a victory on Tuesday night.
“[Lin] is coming off a severe injury to his hand, but tonight he looked great and it looks like he’s coming back strongly. We had fantastic performances tonight and I am hoping that carries over to the Regional event in a couple of weeks.”
For the men’s foil division, the Beanpot tournament served to reinforce the new-found dominance of the squad. Over the course of the night, the foil group—led by Kaneshige and Lin—would only drop three matches against its Boston rivals to emerge from the Beanpot with a stellar record of 24-3.
The story was similar on the women’s side, as the No. 7 Harvard women’s squad dominated throughout the tournament, outscoring its opponents 65-16.
In the first match of the night for the women, the Crimson outdueled the Engineers, 21-6.  The squad went on to best the Eagles, 20-7, before cruising past the Judges, 22-5.
Sophomore Alexandra Kiefer, freshman Emma Vaggo and senior Caroline Vloka each led the team for the second week in a row, helping Harvard to soundly defeat its trio of local opponents. Kiefer, Vaggo, and Vloka were unbeaten on the night in the foil, epee, and sabre, respectively.
With the end of the regular season, the Crimson now begin a three-week-long training regimen as it prepares for its next challenges during the NCAA Regionals and the eventual NCAA Championship.
“We are going to take a little break for now,” Brand said. “We have quite a few injuries on the team that we have to deal with, but we are going to pick up things against next week and start preparing for the NCAA Regional Tournament. We are looking to qualify the maximum—which is 12 fencers—for the National Championship held in Ohio this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my sophomore year, two blockmates transformed the sports culture at Harvard. Now, one is doing the same in the NBA, and the other is making sure no one forgets about it. While much attention has deservedly been paid to hoops sensation Jeremy Lin ’10 and the role he played in changing the culture of Crimson basketball, no one in school at the time could forget the role that his blockmate Cheng Ho ’10 played.
In many ways, Lin and Ho seem to be the perfect complements to each other. Lin was quiet and humble in interviews. He’d never project his own performances, so, to an extent, Ho had to. Even now after his jaw-dropping performances, Lin is quick to credit his teammates, including the one he has up in the sky. It’s extremely impressive.
But just as impressive is Ho’s ability to stay “team first,” to continue to be Lin’s loudest and most influential fan, and to sublimate his own ego in order to raise up the stature of a friend.
Ho’s acts are especially noble when you consider that he used to be the one making the headlines. Because before he began the push to get Lin invited to the rookie-sophomore game, before he became the leader of the student section at Lavietes Pavilion, and before Lin even became a starter, Ho was an All-Ivy running back and a star athlete with his own underdog story.
After emigrating from Taiwan when his father died and his mother became ill, Ho arrived in Martinez, Ga. unable to speak any English. But by the time he finished a postgraduate year at Avon Old Farms, he had been accepted into Harvard.
During his sophomore year, he was the Crimson’s top running back and earned second-team All-Ivy honors. He and Chris Pizzotti ’09 led Harvard to an undefeated Ivy season. That basketball season, Lin followed Ho’s lead with a second-team All- Ivy selection of his own.
But from that point on, their athletic careers went in opposite directions. Lin emerged as a star, first in the Ivy league, and now in the NBA. Ho’s sophomore year proved to be the height of his production. Injuries and the emergence of Gino Gordon ’11 and current junior Treavor Scales meant that Ho would never again be his team’s featured back. While Ho would still have one last day to shine in the game against Lehigh during his senior year when he ran for 132 yards, he ranked third in the Crimson’s depth chart before his career was ended for good by a lisfranc (mid-foot) sprain.
Did Ho’s decline on the gridiron dampen his legacy? Far from it. Instead, his leadership on and off the field enhanced it. When he could no longer make the plays on the field, Ho focused all of his energy on supporting his teammates who could play, giving tips where he could, and holding his teammates to a high standard. For his efforts, he received the William Paine LaCroix Trophy for “enthusiasm, sportsmanship, and loyalty” at the football team’s end-of-season banquet.
Last year was the year when Harvard basketball earned its first-ever share of the Ivy title, but it was the two years before it, particularly the 2009-2010 season, when the student body really came alive. That was the year Ho coined the famous “I believe that we will win” chant. And for the first time in a long time, we did believe.
Ho and Lin are setting fantastic examples for young athletes everywhere, and it’s important that we remember both of them, the obstacles they have faced, and the way they have triumphed.
While Lin’s athletic accomplishments came on a much bigger stage, Ho too has created a unique legacy. How often do we hear analysts wonder whether a star athlete will be willing to share minutes or accept a role as a back-up? While Lin is deflecting personal attention and choosing to focus on his teammates and the work the team has done as a whole, Ho has spent much of his free time working to elevate his friend. We all say we root for our friends’ accomplishments, but how many can really dedicate themselves in the way that Ho has? How many of us could watch our football careers be taken away from us by a practice injury and waste not a second on self-pity?
These two have demonstrated determination and teamwork as well as anyone. And you can’t understand what it really means to be a team player without knowing both sides.
