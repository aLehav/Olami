After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What Sammy Knew” may be non-fiction writer David Laskin’s first stab at writing fiction, but it’s clearly not the work of an amateur. It is, in fact, a timely coming of age story — one that will thrill the casual reader and appease the literary critic.
Laskin’s first novel tells the story of 17-year-old Sam Stein, who faces the daunting task of maturing in the tumultuous world of the first months of 1970, with the Anti-War and Black Power Movements in full swing. Living in the affluent Long Island suburbs of New York, Sam sees his cookie-cutter world slowly shatter into pieces after he discovers that his parents will be letting go of Tutu, the live-in maid to whom he feels closer than his own mother. The event sends Sam leaving his long-awaited senior spring far behind him. While his new experiences make the wider world seem as confusing as ever, Sam gains — through his excitement, struggle, and loss — a much better understanding of himself and those around him.
Though Sam’s journey to maturity is set over 50 years ago, the issues that he faces are many of the same that today’s youth face. Indeed, becoming an adult in a society reckoning with racism, sexism, drug use, domestic violence, and homophobia should sound very familiar to any teen living today. Likewise, Sam’s struggle to clarify his own beliefs and plot a path for his future is one that should hit home both for young adults and readers past this stage in their life as it’s a nearly universal struggle at the core of any moment of maturation.
Laskin often opts for graphic sexual content which can feel a bit out of place for a story about a 17 year old. Thankfully, aside from this one exception, Laskin is successful in revealing himself through “What Sammy Knew” as a talented and entertaining writer. Laskin’s writing moves quickly and generates excitement at just the right moments, and though clear and simple — sacrificing a bit of nuance in the process — it also contains descriptive turns of phrase that stand out for their elegance. In one sequence, Laskin demonstrates his flexibility as a writer by revealing the details of a single episode — Sam’s visit to Tutu’s Harlem apartment — in three different ways: through standard narration, entries into Sam’s diary, and Sam’s conversation with Kim. The result is much more engaging than if he had revealed all the details of this long and detailed scene through standard narration.
Perhaps most impressive, though, is the balance that Laskin strikes between appealing to the casual reader and appeasing a literary critic. Of course, many decisions that Laskin is forced to make in the novel favor one over another, but in the end, the sum of his choices is a product that both should enjoy. For example, the shifts in perspective between the characters is engaging, but in doing so, the secondary characters paradoxically become more one-dimensional than they would be if they were described only from Sam’s point of view. This blow to the narrative is blunted, however, by the addition of many autobiographical details — Laskin himself grew up on Long Island and shares a similar heritage to Sam — which help the story feel more relatable and authentic. To top it off, Laskin makes effective use of symbolism and allusions — to religion, music, Wordsworth, Ginsberg, and more. Most striking are his repeated references to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” setting up an intriguing comparison between Gatsby’s New York and Sam’s.
In the end, “What Sammy Knew” is an entertaining and clever modern novel that should appeal to a wide audience. It is well-written, with this audience in mind, and tells a rather poignant story. And, of course, it is an encouraging sign for Laskin’s budding fiction-writing career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I split my childhood between woodsy creeks in Pennsylvania and the forests of Narnia. The line between where I ended and Lucy Pevensie began was blurry; I cut my hair in her same British bob and used her favorite healing potion on my siblings. I learned how to will myself onto a lion’s back, feeling the soft strands of Aslan’s hair falling through my hands.
When Narnia drifted away with adolescence, I found a teenaged fantasy world just as enchanting: the world of Dodie Clark. I crawled inside her songs with the same abandon, living in her universe of yellow flowers and smeared makeup and sunshine the next morning. But this time, I devoured more than just the words themselves. I devoured her life — the people she was friends with, her favorite playlists, the way she put little eyeliner dots under her eyes.
She didn’t make it hard. Most of Dodie’s early fans found her through YouTube, where she’d post vlogs on everything from messy bun tutorials to her first girl crush. In almost every video, she was sitting in a perfectly-lit room, surrounded by fairy lights, with a carefully-applied face of makeup and a lilting, syncopated voice.
A few videos, however, departed from her usual brand. These were bracingly, unusually vulnerable — devoid of good lighting or eyeliner or a carefully-prepared script. Dodie’s music has always touched on her experience of living with mental illness, but in these particular vlogs, she pulled back the curtain with no filter, no rhyme scheme, no soundtrack. In one video from 2016 called “pasta is good life is SAD,” she’s drunk and cooking pasta in her kitchen while talking about the difference between heartbreak and depression. After having her heart broken, she says she kept waiting for her depression to come back, bracing for the heaviness and suicidal thoughts she had come to expect. But instead, life was “dealable.” It was a heavy conversation, punctuated by a pasta pot almost boiling over and an occasional alcohol-induced sentence that made no sense.
Her fans were obsessed. “pasta is good life is SAD” now has almost 1.2 million views. Viewers flooded the comments section to share similar experiences, talking about coming out of a dark place or accidentally dousing their stove with pasta water. Someone even wrote her an original song in response. In a similar 2017 video called “I am depressed today,” Dodie eats snow peas on her living room floor while she talks about accepting the fact that there are days she will wake up depressed. Underneath it, one commenter wrote: “Fun fact: every time I watch this, I pull out some frozen veggies and eat with you.”
In another deeply personal video, Dodie read a series of texts she’d written to friends trying to describe a feeling she didn’t have words for at that point. “I had this uncomfortable sense of floating,” she says. “Not taking in as much as I used to, not being able to see properly, my memory being really bad.” I slowly realized I knew what she was talking about. The recurring feelings I’d been struggling with — of being frozen in and cut off from my body, unable to shake myself fully awake or remember where I was — had a name. Dissociation. It was a relief to know that someone else knew how I felt. But on the other hand, I still didn’t have a way to turn it off. Neither did she.
So instead of problem-solving, I just kept watching. I listened to her explain her diagnoses of Derealization and Depersonalization, watched her try therapy and medication and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. I knew the names of all of her best friends and her favorite kind of vegan mac and cheese.
On the one hand, I’m grateful that she shared so much with her followers; I was able to watch the life and hope and passion seep back into her as her mental health improved. But in many ways, disappearing into her words and favorite colors and way of seeing the world only made my own dissociation worse. After all, the dissociative episodes I was so scared of came from the same desire for escapism that had pulled me deep into someone else’s life in the first place.
Thanking a celebrity for “saving your life” seems to be increasingly normal nowadays, especially among Gen Z. Ironically, I think I see this sentiment directed most often not at doctors or psychiatrists, but at artists: people who express the same feeling a fan is struggling with, even if they don’t know how to fix it. This makes sense to a point; I think the pain we don’t know how to talk about, the things that shame and overwhelm and isolate us from those we love, can sometimes be the most dangerous. But there is an inherent imbalance to relationships between fans and artists. For artists, being someone’s self-proclaimed savior is an enormous pressure. What happens when your mental health recovery is not linear and you screw up in front of the eyes of a million young fans? For fans, there’s a danger that these celebrity saviors can become a substitute for real-life support. Sometimes, it’s far easier to share the things you’re most scared of with strangers on the Internet than with the loved ones right next to you.
For years, I never talked to anyone about struggling with dissociation. If it weren’t for Dodie’s videos, maybe I wouldn’t have had the language to understand what was going on, or the self-compassion to recognize that I wasn’t crazy and that this was just a flawed, healable coping mechanism. But I also think the Internet allowed me to “get by'' without really having to do the hard work of healing — of opening up, of asking for help, of fighting to get better.
A few years ago, Dodie deleted most of her videos about mental health. In explaining the decision, she talked about the one-sided experience of being the particular kind of “It Gets Better” celebrity that sings and writes about mental health for a young and vulnerable audience (think Demi Lovato or Twenty One Pilots). “All I want is to be understood, so I pour it out to the world, and I don’t get that back,” she explained in an interview with the Los Angeles Review of Books.
Arguably, Dodie gained a following through her songs’ delicate poetry and her online vulnerability in equal turn. Would she be releasing a debut album next month if she didn’t upload “pasta is good life is SAD” five years ago? Has the vulnerability she’s shared with her fans always been a safe thing for them, or for her? It’s hard to say.
This year, Dodie decided to put her darker videos back online. “Pasta is good life is SAD” isn’t searchable on the internet or Youtube anymore, but it’s tucked within a playlist on her personal account for her old fans. She still vlogs, but she doesn’t make those same kinds of videos anymore — no on-camera mental breakdowns or no-holds-barred vulnerability. As she put it to The Big Issue: “So many of [fans’] messages tell me, you’re the only person in my life who gets me, you’re the only one who understands. But as much as I would love to, I cannot hug a million people. So I always tell them to reach out to people who know them and really love them.” It’s good advice.
One of my favorite Dodie songs is “Ready Now.” Eight echoey copies of her voice hum behind her as she chronicles the euphoria of real, solid friendship, and the moment when you realize you’ve found a person who feels truly safe. “You saw through me all this time / I'd forgotten people are kind,” she sings. “I believe you, I'm not wrong / Oh, it suits me to feel strong.” I’ll never forget the person who first believed me, the way she left me with strength and understanding deeper and more real than a hundred Youtube videos.
When I listen to that song now, I think back to the girl who became obsessed with Dodie five years ago, to the kid on a tire swing trying to find her way to Narnia. I wish I could reach back and tell her that there will be moments when life is overwhelming. There will be moments when imagination has to be enough. But eventually you’ll be ready to come back to the real world and stay there: to turn off the TV and the music and the thousand distractions, and look in the eyes of the people you love. To tell them you are glad to be here — solid and imperfect and real and alive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zeynep opens up rather easily — in fact, she rushes through our interview offering mostly unprompted answers, taking only small breaks to relight her dying cigarette. She strikes me as casual in a distinctly Gen-Z way, using expletives out of frustration, and switching swiftly to dry, cynical humor. But for the occasional pause to check the English translation of a Turkish word, she would fit right into our campus.
She also happens to be under house arrest, facing an uncertain and unenviable fate.
Zeynep — who asked to be identified by a pseudonym in The Crimson due to fears of retaliation from the Turkish government— is a student at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul. Her institution has been at the center of a spiraling national controversy for more than a month, ever since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appointed Melih Bulu — a political ally with no professional ties to Boğaziçi — as its new rector. Rector Bulu and President Erdoğan did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The decision, which broke with a decades-long streak of university-selected rectors, has been criticized as an attack on an institution known for its liberal, radically undogmatic campus, and prompted immediate backlash from students and faculty members. That’s what first prompted Zeynep — a self-described “apolitical” person who doesn’t usually get involved in protests with the exception of Pride parades — to act.
“I value Boğaziçi more than anything in this country because it is the only place that could hold their values — those ethical values, this independence,” she says, adding that she thought it was her “democratical right to stand against” the appointment. And so she, along with some other “artists of the university” found herself attending a protest exhibition, one that she says came to involve more than 150 artists across a variety of disciplines. She describes the event as an “open exhibition, an open rave at the same time.”
But the punk-themed approach soon took a darker turn. A piece at the exhibition featuring the Meccan Kaaba and LGBT flags offended some Muslim members of the community and drew a furious government response. Suleyman Soylu tweeted that the protesters were “LGBT perverts”; President Erdogan chose the term terrorists. The organizers — who Zeynep said never thought they would be arrested, given their status as the “hippies of the university” — were detained as they left the event, trying to evade the backlash from the officials’ statements. More than 150 Turkish citizens were arrested in connection with the protest.
After her own arrest, Zeynep spent a night in jail. She says the charges against her were unclear, and that the officers who arrested her refused to clarify what exactly she was accused of. Her account, as a young person wrestling with mental health struggles (for which she claims she didn’t receive her medication), is nightmarish.“The lights were white, and always on so I couldn't sleep,” she says, describing the non-functional clocks in the room and the uncertainty about how long she would be detained.
“It was definitely, definitely psychological torture.”
Zeynep’s story represents the latest predictable, albeit upsetting, development of Turkey’s crackdown on academia — which in recent years included the purge of thousands of university professors — and bodes poorly for the country’s democratic future. I spoke to Harvard Kennedy School Professor Dani Rodrik, born in Turkey, who argues that the Erdoğan Presidency has made Turkey “less and less free every year.” “It has poisoned not just political life, it has poisoned social life, academic life,” he said in an interview. Professor Rodrik, who said he supported the students’ cause, also mentioned how the political shift had an impact on his own trajectory and that of his wife, Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Pinar Dogan. Around 2010 they “were seriously considering going back to Turkey,” he says, yet the shifting political environment forced them to “reconsider that very, very quickly.”
So Turkish democracy is in decline — we’ve known that for a while. Why does it matter now, or rather, why should it matter to us and our institution?
Because the trend is international, and other liberal democracies are hardly safe.
Global democracy is in bad shape — according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, it’s in the worst shape it has ever been since the organization started collecting data on the matter 15 years ago. American democratic quality in particular has seen a steady decline since 2006, a fact that perhaps comes as no surprise in the wake of the Capitol riots last month. In fact, the parallels in authoritarianism between Turkey and the United States are striking: Soylu, the Turkish Interior minister, in a move resembling that of many Trump loyalists, has forcefully denounced Twitter for limiting access to his “perverts” tweet, stating that the company offers a “shield” to BGLTQ and terrorist organizations; the general ambition to purge and reshape academic debate in the U.S. is perhaps best understood as a more powerful and effective 1776 Commission. To think that American higher education institutions might be targeted in the future is hardly a stretch — we’ve been there before.
It’s undeniable that universities are an essential part of any functioning democracy — and that any attempt at dismantling liberal democratic institutions necessarily passes through (or rather over) independent-minded educational institutions. They occupy a dual role, canaries in a coal mine that can also, through their powerful institutional call, help thwart the advance of authoritarian, illiberal policies at home — as our own University did, to its credit, under the Trump administration when it sued to halt new visa policies that would have evicted and barred international students.
But I’d argue that universities also have a responsibility to aid their fellow institutions, however far away, that are choking in a cloud of increasing authoritarianism. A responsibility rooted in the awareness that their struggle and values are the very same ones; in the knowledge that with every prominent academic institution that falls, our shared goals retreat further.
Harvard, as arguably the most recognizable — and almost indisputably the most economically powerful and politically influential — ought to be at the forefront of that very struggle, harvesting our influence and outsized public microphone to champion. This means mobilizing alumni and resources, offering aid to affected faculty, or, at the very least, vociferously voicing its disapproval. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the events at Boğaziçi.
Of course, that might be an uncomfortable position for Harvard, given our numerous ties to governments that restrict intellectual discourse and our reliance on donors who have little regard for free speech. It certainly could be read as hypocritical. And so policies that are regularly justified under the guise of empowering our academia — of gaining funds for ambitious research projects and establishing valuable international connections — prevent us from resisting infringements on academic freedom when it matters most.
The latest crackdown at Boğaziçi demands a response from Harvard, but also a listen — has the canary stopped singing?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks to a grant from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, Harvard recently acquired four new fully electric shuttle buses, fulfilling part of its pledge to implement a zero-emission vehicle action plan.
The University played up the move in both a press release and a Harvard Gazette article, trumpeting their action as a “major step” towards its goal of making an “aggressive effort” to eliminate its use of fossil fuels by 2050.
A transition to electric vehicles is progress, but regrettably, these are not magic school buses. Harvard’s proclamation of the four-bus purchase as if it were a panacea is overblown, and in our opinion, self-indulgent.
Even for Harvard’s modest goal of being fossil fuel-free by 2050 — a target we’ve argued is too little, too late — a few electric buses is hardly enough. According to a report from Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, vehicles represent only one percent of the University’s greenhouse gas emissions; bearing in mind the magnitude of Harvard’s carbon footprint, partially checking the vehicle emissions box takes barely more than a carbon drop out of the bucket.
These buses are an improvement, but nowhere near enough, and we cannot afford to glorify meager changes. Every organization has a moral responsibility to combat climate change to the extent of its ability, and Harvard, with its vast array of resources, is no exception.
What else can Harvard do to combat the climate crisis? Make the rest of the bus fleet electric, for one. It’s also long past the time for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels.
Climate change has only gotten worse since we first called for the University to divest, long after student activists began their efforts — 2020 tied for the hottest year on record. A pledge to keep Harvard’s $41.9 billion out of the hands of companies actively contributing to the destruction of our planet would demonstrate a real commitment to combating the climate crisis, beyond just adhering to state initiatives.
Harvard knows the impact that its decisions can inspire; when speaking of the electric bus purchase, Managing Director of the Harvard Office for Sustainability Heather A. Henriksen said that “Harvard hopes to be a catalyst for other universities, businesses, and cities.” The University clearly acknowledges that its actions carry weight, yet eschews this espoused responsibility by continuing to take incremental approaches to an existential crisis. Harvard can truly be influential by demonstrating how the university with the largest endowment in the world can invest it responsibly.
And ironically, in the case of electric buses, Harvard does not seem to be the catalyst that the press release suggests: In 2017, the University of California, Irvine became the first college campus in the nation to convert its buses to an all-electric fleet. In 2018, Columbia University introduced six electric buses into its campus shuttle network, and several other campuses have followed their lead.
While we’re eager to have these buses roaming around Cambridge as well, we find ourselves unable to laud this acquisition with the same gusto exhibited in the University’s announcements. The climate crisis demands far more than four electric buses.

In 2015, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave a speech at the Harvard Institute of Politics where he was confronted during a Q&A session about his stance on the “comfort women” issue. The term euphemistically describes women and girls who were forcibly recruited as sex slaves by Japan’s government and military before and during World War II. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Abe gave a hollow reply that avoided direct responsibility for the suffering of up to hundreds of thousands of comfort women, sparking international outrage. Six years later, Harvard again finds itself in the middle of a controversy over attempts to distort history.
As The Crimson recently reported, J. Mark Ramseyer, a Harvard Law School Japanese legal studies professor, wrote in a forthcoming publication titled “Contracting for sex in the Pacific War” that comfort women were voluntary prostitutes engaged in contractual bargaining for their own financial gain. Ramseyer’s assertion that victims were merely willing prostitutes unjustly denies the suffering of up to hundreds of thousands of women who were coerced into sexual slavery. The Japanese government and military conscripted these victims from Korea, China, the Philippines, Singapore, and Indonesia among other countries and territories under Japanese occupation at the time. Ramseyer’s paper provoked an immediate rebuke from scholars and students alike for its gaps in reasoning and eschewal of key sources.
The publishing of Ramseyer’s paper is not a standalone incident, but rather one that fits into continuing, large-scale efforts to rewrite history and silence these victims of sexual slavery. The Japanese government itself acknowledged in its 1993 Kono Statement that “the then Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of comfort stations.”
However, Abe’s reelection in 2012 marked a definitive shift in the Japanese government’s attitude towards this dark chapter of their history. Gone was its formerly “apologetic” attitude towards Japan’s World War II adversaries and victims. Under Abe, Japan’s empowered and emboldened nationalist right-wing party engaged in historical revisionism that would restore “national pride.”
After Abe’s reelection, the Japanese government pushed a series of brazen revisionist efforts aimed at erasing and denying the comfort women issue. For example, in 2014, Japan’s second-largest newspaper was pressured by public criticism to retract articles from the 1980s and early 1990s that had exposed the truth about comfort women. In 2015, Abe’s government attempted in vain to persuade the United Nations to revise its 1996 human rights report that detailed the atrocities endured by “women victims of military sexual slavery during wartime” and how “the Japanese were able to procure more women for the increasing demands of the army by using violence and outright coercion.” That same year, representatives of the Japanese government unsuccessfully demanded McGraw-Hill Education, a major U.S. publishing company, change passages detailing the history of comfort women issue in a history textbook.
Ramseyer’s writings arrive in the midst of some relevant developments in Korean courts. In 2013, 12 former comfort women who were subjected to sexual slavery filed a lawsuit against Japan in the Seoul Central District Court, demanding reparations. In January 2021, the Seoul Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered Japan to pay $91,800 to each plaintiff. This ruling followed a similar one in 2018 by South Korea’s Supreme Court that ordered Mitsubishi Industries of Japan to compensate women whom they had subjected to forced labor during World War II.
One week after the January 2021 Seoul Court ruling, Ramseyer penned an article titled “Recovering the Truth about the Comfort Women.” This article claims that the reports of comfort women were “pure fiction” and was published in Japan Forward, the English language website of Sankei Shimbun, a nationalist newspaper known for its revisionism efforts. The same website announced the upcoming publication of “Contracting for sex in the Pacific War” in a press release at the end of January.
Ramseyer, as a law professor at one of the world’s most prestigious universities, can lend immense credibility to these efforts to whitewash history. Numerous former comfort women have testified to their plights, and failing to acknowledge and respect them equates to silencing their voices. Ramseyer’s paper also comes at a dire and painful moment in history: In South Korea, fewer than 20 former comfort women are alive today. There will soon come a time when these women will no longer be able to relay their experience and share their perspectives, making it even more difficult to protect and preserve the truth.

Harvard Law School students and faculty said they are encouraged by the Biden administration's reversal of a ban on transgender individuals joining the United States military.
Former President Donald J. Trump, who announced the ban on Twitter in July 2017, stated at the time that the U.S. government would not allow transgender people to “serve in any capacity” in the military. During his first week in office, President Joe Biden signed a Jan. 25 executive order stating gender identity should not disqualify any Americans from military service.
Alexander L. Chen, who is the founding director of the Law School’s LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic, said that countless people’s lives were “thrown into confusion and dismay” because of the former president’s “thoughtless tweet.”
In response to the ban and military recruitment interviews held at the Law School's campus, in September 2017 more than a dozen students staged a sit-in, which was organized by HLS student groups Lambda and Queer Trans People of Color.
At the time, Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an email to students that while he acknowledged allowing the military on campus was an “exception” to the school’s anti-discrimination policy, the Law School had to allow military interviews because of the Solomon Amendment, a rule which requires federally-funded universities to permit on-campus military recruiting.
Current Co-President of HLS Lambda Matthew P. Shields said Lambda advocated for its members to stop receiving unsolicited emails from the Judge Advocate General’s Corps — the branch of the U.S. military concerned with military law. The organization formulated a template individuals could fill out requesting to opt out of the government organization's communications.
“It’s extraordinarily insensitive to ask for students to apply to a job that they cannot have simply because of their identity for purely discriminatory reasons,” Shields said.
Zachary U. Boulden, who also serves as Lambda co-president, said the Law School’s Office of Public Interest Advising helped Lambda handle the unsolicited military recruitment emails by reaching out to the recruiter on the student group's behalf.
The Law School has also provided Lambda with amelioration funds for the past several years following the ban's implementation, per Shields. Shields said the organization has used the funds in “productive ways” and that he hopes the Law School does not stop providing funds to the group following the ban's reversal.
“Just because the policy is lifted doesn’t mean the damage done has been repaired,” Shields said. “It is just nice to have that money and to try to be able to put it towards, in some way, bettering the law school and hopefully, the trans community at large.”
Boulden said Lambda has been in communication with the Law School on how best to use the funds to benefit transgender individuals.
“We’re hoping to partner with a small journal at the Law School to create a prize for work on transgender legal issues,” Boulden said.
Chen, who litigated several cases against the transgender military ban, said that while not all court decisions ruled favorably for transgender individuals, he believes the lawsuits called for serious administrative action.
“I think the lawsuits were very critical because they, in the meantime, put a pause on that policy, saved the careers of people who were already openly serving and really put the issue on the agenda of the next administration that this is an important priority area if you care about LGBTQ rights,” he said. “You need to do something about this.”
Come the next presidential election, Chen added, he believes there will be further evidence that there is no legitimate reason to ban transgender individuals from serving.
“Regardless of the next presidential election outcome, I would be highly surprised if a future of Republican president would act in as rash manner as this one, especially because at that time we'll have four more years of evidence that there’s absolutely no problem, as a general matter with transgender people serving in the military,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Black students at the College remain scattered across the world amid the coronavirus pandemic, many Black cultural organizations are finding ways to adapt staples of their Black History Month programming to a virtual setting.
In a typical year, Black cultural organizations gather in House common space and classrooms across campus to honor Black History Month through a series of discussions, socials, movie screenings, and trivia nights.
Samantha C. W. O’Sullivan ’22, president of the Generational African American Students Association, said her organization will be hosting a discussion series called “For Tha Culture February” to analyze topics related to Black culture, such as politics, code-switching, representation in media, and self-love and relationships.
“We wanted to use Black History Month to really delve deeper into a lot of these topics and focus on issues related to generational African Americans that aren’t usually talked about,” O’Sullivan said.
Orvin A. Pierre ’22, president of the Black Men’s Forum, said the group is planning to launch its alumni mentorship program this month and host a forum for its members to examine the impact of Covid-19 on Black individuals.
Marissa J. Joseph ’23, special events chair for the Association of Black Harvard Women and an active editor for the Crimson Editorial Board, said ABHW planned a social media campaign to support Black-owned businesses in Cambridge.
“On our Instagram story, we are going to be highlighting Black grassroots organizations in Cambridge,” Joseph said. “Our hope is to raise awareness and exposure about these organizations.”
Other organizations, like Harvard Black Community Leaders, will continue to hold their annual Community Conversations series this February to facilitate conversations among Black students related to exclusivity, sexual assault accountability, being Black at Harvard, and the impact of social media.
In addition, the Black Students Association — Harvard’s largest affinity group — will host its fourth annual Black Legacy Ball, an annual gala to honor the achievements of Black students, faculty, and alumni.
While many Black students will observe Black History Month, some members of Black cultural organizations called on University affiliates more broadly to honor the month too.
Joseph said she wishes Harvard students would “educate themselves beyond the surface level” through the variety of classes Harvard offers pertaining to Black history and culture.
“I would love for people to ask themselves whether they have been taking the steps to educate themselves or did they just post on Instagram and keep it pushing,” Joseph said. “People can read some Black radical texts and make sure that they are putting in the work education-wise.”
Joseph added that ABHW’s work does not stop in February — it is a yearlong operation.
“ABHW makes it a point to celebrate Black history and Black women,” Joseph said. “In a normal school year, we have various educational events that are on the forefront of creating change on campus.”
Pierre said Black History Month is “empowering” and called on Harvard affiliates to consider why Black history is underrepresented in school curricula.
“I’d say reflect upon why we think it is that Black history isn’t taught in schools or isn’t taught as much, except for a month,” Pierre said. “To really reflect upon our history as America and see where we can improve upon teaching our histories and being overall generally inclusive of the knowledge that we share about our communities.”
O’Sullivan also said attending events and learning about Black history should continue after February.
“I hope that students who aren’t Black or aren’t involved in the Black community become aware of the different Black groups on campus and take the time to engage and go to some of these events,” O’Sullivan said.
“At least speaking for GAASA — and I know it’s true for all of the other Black orgs — we all put on programming like this year round,” she said. “To us, every month is Black History Month.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in a Monday interview that she remains cautiously optimistic that Harvard will return to normal, in-person operations in fall 2021.
While Gay acknowledged the possibility of returning the full student body to campus in the coming fall, she also said fall planning efforts must remain in tune with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and vaccine distribution efforts.
“I remain hopeful that fall will bring a return to our normal campus operations,” she said. “But I’m also realistic that a lot of things would need to break our way for that to happen, and there are no guarantees.”
“If Covid has taught us anything over the last 11 months, it’s that nothing is guaranteed,” she added.
Gay said that given “the uncertainty of some really important variables” connected to the pandemic — including the availability and impact of vaccines — she continues to keep multiple planning scenarios for the fall under consideration.
Gay added that she will provide further updates to Harvard affiliates about fall 2021 planning later this spring.
In a Feb. 3 Harvard Graduate Council meeting, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said there will “probably be stages” to the potential reopening of campus in the fall in light of the emergence of new Covid-19 variants in the United States.
Looking toward the summer, Gay said the FAS still plans to offer two free courses through the Harvard Summer School to undergradutes who were enrolled remotely for the entirety of the 2020-21 academic year. She declined to comment, however, on whether these courses would be offered in-person or remotely.
The Office of Undergraduate Education is working alongside FAS departments to “ensure that the academic offerings for sophomores especially this summer are robust,” she added. During this academic year, students of all grade levels except sophomores had the opportunity to live on campus for one semester, though sophomores with challenging learning environments at home could petition to live in the dorms.
“We made the really difficult decision to pursue remote teaching and learning for the full academic year for reasons that were really grounded, first and foremost, in our commitment to protecting health and safety, and also ensuring that we could preserve academic continuity for all of our students,” Gay said. “That said, despite our efforts to create a robust, online learning environment for our students, I understand that there are challenges.”
Faced with remote classes, limited social lives, and canceled athletics, some students who enrolled last fall declared a leave of absence this spring. The spring semester saw roughly 150 fewer undergraduates enrolled than in the fall semester as of the deadline by which students could opt to take the semester off without incurring a fee.
Nonetheless, Gay said she is optimistic about the opportunities the spring semester will bring.
“I was really pleased with the success of the fall semester, and I’m eager to replicate that this semester, ensure that our students continue to make academic progress, and provide the high quality educational experience that is distinctive to Harvard,” Gay said.
“We also do that in a way that protects the health and safety of our community — both on-campus communities, as well as the broader Cambridge and Boston community that we are a part of,” she added.

Three Harvard professors were among 106 new members elected this year to the National Academy of Engineering, the academy announced Tuesday.
Those selected included Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III, bioengineering professor Donald E. Ingber, and Harvard Kennedy School professor William W. Hogan.
Founded in 1964, the NAE uses the expertise of its members to advise the federal government on matters related to engineering and technology. Election to the NAE is “among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer,” per its website.
Doyle, Ingber, and Hogan will join the Academy’s 2,352 other American members and 298 international members.
Doyle, who said he was “still soaring high” after receiving the news, was elected for “insights into natural biological control systems and innovative engineering of diabetes control devices.”
A graduate of Princeton University and the California Institute of Technology, Doyle has been a faculty member at Harvard since 2015. Prior to working at Harvard, he was chair of the Department of Chemical Engineering and associate dean of research at the University of California Santa Barbara, where he also headed the UCSB/MIT/Caltech Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies.
Doyle has been a member of the National Academy of Medicine – a counterpart of the NAE – since 2016, and a fellow at multiple world-renowned organizations, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, for which he served as president for the Control Systems Society in 2015.
Ingber, who teaches at both SEAS and Harvard Medical School, was awarded for “interdisciplinary contributions to mechanobiology and microsystems engineering, and leadership in biologically inspired engineering.”
He described the NAE’s work in an email as “critical for our collective future success,” and noted he was “proud and honored” to have the chance to collaborate with fellow NAE engineers.
Ingber’s work with SEAS, HMS, and Boston Children’s Hospital has combined techniques across fields to explore the effect of cell structure on tissue development and biochemistry.
He has authored more than 430 publications and 150 patents and has founded five companies. Like Doyle, Ingber was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2012, and he was elected to the National Academy of Inventors in 2015.
The NAE recognized Hogan for “contributions to electricity industry restructuring, electricity market design, and energy policy modeling and analysis.”
Specializing in global energy policy, Hogan is the current research director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. He previously worked at Stanford University, where he founded the Energy Modeling Forum, and he is the former president of the International Association for Energy Economics.
“The main focus has been to take theory into practice in improving the operation of actual markets,” Hogan wrote in an email. “The foundations are even more important for the future as we move to increasing reliance on renewable energy.”
Doyle, who noted his membership letter was signed by a former professor of his, wrote that he hopes he can inspire a future generation of engineers as his own professors did him.
“One thought that struck me as I poured over the lovely emails I’ve received is how much I owe to those who trained me and helped build the foundation that I can rise from,” Doyle wrote. “It’s humbling to think about the foundations that all of us in the academy are helping to build for the next generation.”
The newly elected members will be officially inducted at the Academy's annual meeting on Oct. 3, 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” continues to reign as the most popular spring semester course for the eighth consecutive year, followed by the pre-medical lab course Life Sciences 1b: “Intro to Life Sciences II” and a new contender, General Education 1014: “Ancestry.”
Ec 10b led spring course enrollment with a total of 511 students, Life Sciences 1b took the second spot with 386 students, and Gen Ed 1014 rounded out the top three with 373 students, according to data released by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences registrar’s office. Physical Sciences 11: “Frontiers of Modern Chemistry” and Chemistry 27: “Organic Chemistry of Life” filled out the top five most popular courses, boasting 299 and 281 students, respectively.
Economics professor Jason Furman ’92, who helms Ec 10b alongside his colleague David I. Laibson ’88, said economics is a field that “everyone should know” and build into their understanding of the world. Their course — currently the most popular at the College —provides an introduction to macroeconomics, covering a range of topics from racial disparities in unemployment to the workings of the global economy.
“It’s everything from big social science questions to policy questions to helping you think about your own life and your own decisions,” Furman said.
Continuing their approach to the course last spring, Furman said he and Laibson have tailored the course to explore the ongoing coronavirus pandemic's impact on the economy.
Though LS 1b holds the same ranking as last spring with the second largest enrollment, Gen Ed 1014: “Ancestry” climbed up from its former nineteenth place to third place this year, more than doubling its enrollment since last year.
Gen Ed 1014's head course instructor, Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, said the course offers an “interdisciplinary investigation” of lineage and inheritance using tools from fields including anthropology, biology, and history. She speculated that the prominence of national conversations related to marginalization and belonging may have encouraged more students to take her course this year.
“We are in the midst of a national conversation about who we are as a nation, and the ways in which certain lineages have been marginalized and mistreated throughout our national history,” Jasanoff said. “I do think the fact that issues of identity and belonging are so much at the forefront of the national conversation right now could be an explanation.”
Physical Sciences 11 held steady from last spring as the fourth most popular course, while this semester’s fifth-placer Chemistry 27 clambered up from its former seventh place ranking.
Chemistry professor Emily P. Balskus, who teaches Chemistry 27, said she modified the course in response to the pandemic to give her students the opportunity to apply the concepts they learn to the ongoing process of developing drugs to treat Covid-19.
“Our goal is to give students a new way to look at the world — the ability to view the world from a molecular perspective,” Balskus said. “I think our current situation really hits home how important knowledge can be.”

David C. Huang ’24, a freshman who is living on campus this spring, said he is looking forward to the “small things” once the pandemic subsides.
“I want to go into all the buildings for the first time,” he said. “I want to go into Widener. I want to go actually sit in a lecture hall, go into other people's rooms and just hang out.”
Though invited to live on campus last semester, freshmen experienced a far-from-normal first semester of college, marked by regular Covid-19 testing, social distancing protocols, and virtual learning.
When the College announced it would prioritize bringing upperclassmen back to campus for the spring semester, some freshmen petitioned to return to campus, while others opted to stay at home; some flocked to off-campus apartments with newly-made friends.
Tianming “Tex” Xie ’24 said he is living off campus with friends he met through a class in the fall.
“We know each other through a class we all took, and I think we’re all good friends,” Xie said. “We wanted to stay close to campus because we knew that a lot of our friends would be around here, and we just wanted to be around Harvard.”
John P. “Jack” Cogbill ’24, who is living in Cambridge in an off-campus apartment, said though he “loves being off-campus,” he misses the convenience of living on campus.
“One of the toughest things about living off-campus is you realize, ‘I’ve got to get my own food now,’” Cogbill lamented. “It was really nice to be on a meal plan because it was brainless. You always know you’re going to get a meal provided somewhere.”
“You don’t realize how long it actually takes to go to Costco, for example, and buy all the stuff you need,” he added. “It can be kind of time-consuming.”
Julia S. Casas ’24, who is also living with off-campus, said preparing meals with her roommate serves as bonding.
“I don’t have much cooking experience and neither does my roommate, but I feel like that’s one way we’ve bonded,” Julia S. Casas ’24 said. “Every night we’ll usually eat dinner together, or at least one meal together, and we’ll cook and listen to music and talk about our day.”
Freshmen living in off-campus apartments also said they are heeding public health guidelines by participating in the University’s coronavirus testing program and practicing social distancing.
“I think a lot of — at least the people I know that are off campus — are both doing the Harvard testing and the Cambridge testing just because it looks like Harvard testing is once a week, and if you have multiple roommates, it’s probably better to test more than once a week,” Xie said.
Cogbill said he signed up for the University’s voluntary testing program for enrolled off-campus undergraduates.
“I actually just dropped off my test today,” Cogbill said. “It was actually really easy and it’s super helpful.”
Other freshmen said they chose to live at home this semester because it was their most financially prudent option.
“It was just easier to live at home because it’s cheaper,” said Marian Nguyen ’24, who is living at home in Tulsa, Okla.
Chelsea P. Baker ’24, who is living at home in Maryland this semester, said she initially “dreaded” learning from home but has found the experience comparable to living on campus.
“Before the semester started, I dreaded that it would be very different, but so far it’s been pretty similar,” Baker said. “Only thing I would say is vastly different is usually after class or at the end of the day, I would walk to Annenberg with other people that lived in my dorm.”
Some freshmen who successfully petitioned to live in Harvard's dorms this semester said they have adjusted to life on campus.
“I assume there are less freshmen, but I think that a good amount petitioned to come back,” said Gabrielle J. “Gaby” Pesantez ’24, who is living in Wigglesworth Hall.
Though living on campus is "pretty much the same” for Pesantez as it was during the fall semester, she said Harvard has lost some of its “excitement” because it is no longer new to her.
“I definitely feel more used to this place now,” Pesantez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard student athletes whose senior year seasons were canceled by the coronavirus pandemic are making plans to use their final year of collegiate athletics eligibility at other universities after obtaining their Harvard degrees.
When the Ivy League canceled the fall sports season in July, some student athletes waffled between taking time off and continuing their Harvard education. The Ivy League has since canceled the winter sports season, and the spring sports season remains in flux.
Seniors who opted to finish out their final year at the College will find themselves with at least one additional year of athletics eligibility following graduation. Per Ivy League rules, Harvard cannot field graduate students on its teams, so undergraduates with another year to compete must use it at a non-Ivy League institution.
For men’s basketball player Danilo Djuricic ’21, the cancellation of the winter season meant he would never compete for Harvard basketball again.
“I think what I’ll miss most is definitely the brotherhood that we have on the basketball team — getting to see those guys every day, work hard, and practice,” he said. “Whether it be together on and off the court, that bond that we built, it’s definitely something that I valued really immensely at Harvard.”
At the same time, Djuricic said he will transfer to another school to finish out his collegiate career en route to playing at the professional level, he hopes.
“That’s always been a dream of mine, growing up and wanting to be a professional basketball player and play at the highest level possible,” Djuricic said. “At my next program, I’m really looking to take the next step in terms of basketball and be able to show the complete player I am and really put myself out there for people at the next level to see my ability.”
Djuricic said he has not decided where he will play next year, but that he has received interest from programs across the country.
Harvard football player Devin Darrington ’21 wrote in an email that he had not considered transferring until college football programs reached out to him asking if he was planning to use his extra season of eligibility.
“Once I realized that I had an opportunity to receive a degree from Harvard and play Power Five football, I couldn’t turn that down,” Darrington wrote.
Darrington wrote he decided to transfer to the University of Virginia after consulting with friends and teammates.
“I will miss everything about Harvard...the people, the football, the coaches, my teammates, and more,” he wrote. “Harvard is a very special place.”
By allowing Harvard athletes to transfer to use their athletics eligibility, the NCAA provides them the opportunity to receive a preeminent education and play four years of college sports, according to Harvard football coach Timothy L. Murphy.
“If you are good enough, the Grad Transfer Rule has offered the opportunity for student-athletes to get an extra year or two of D-1 College Football and a scholarship to go with it,” Murphy wrote in an email. “For several of our recent graduates it has allowed them to have the best of both worlds, a Harvard Football experience and undergraduate degree, and a scholarship to graduate school for an MBA as one example.”
Harvard women’s basketball player Jadyn C. Bush ’21 was already considering transferring to another university to finish out her college sports career after enduring a season-ending shoulder injury last year. That injury, paired with the cancellation of sports due to the pandemic, makes her eligible to play two more years on the collegiate stage.
Bush said she hopes to pursue a Master of Public Policy degree at the University of California, Berkeley, where she will also play basketball.
“I knew that I wanted to be at one of the top academic schools in the country, I knew I wanted to be closer to home, and I hoped that I’d have the opportunity to play at a Power Five conference,” Bush said. “So, it was a bit of a no-brainer.”
Her counterpart on the men’s basketball team, Mario O. “Rio” Haskett Jr. ’21, also will use his collegiate eligibility at a university closer to his home in Chesterfield, Va., Hampton University.
By attending Hampton, a historically Black university, Haskett said he hopes to serve as a role model to children of the same background as him.
“I was like, ‘What’s the next decision to help me continue to form this superhero narrative in a way?’” Haskett said. “For people of color and kids like me, it was to go to an HBCU next.”
Haskett said what he will miss the most about Harvard is the people.
“The thing I know I’m going to miss the most is that in-person community. Harvard was a special place, not because of what they taught us, but the type of other kids you meet there and the type of experiences you have with different cultures,” Haskett said. “Talking to that community is something you won’t get at any other school.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s nomination as President Joe Biden’s Labor Secretary, Boston's 2021 mayoral race, once perceived as an uphill battle, has become a wide-open race between City Councilors Michelle Wu ’07, Andrea J. Campbell, and newcomer Annissa Essaibi George.
Within the last month, Wu received several high-profile endorsements from progressive leaders, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the Boston Sunrise Movement. Cambridge City Councilors Quinton Y. Zondervan and Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler previously endorsed Wu’s bid as well.
Despite this new wave of support for Wu, the race remains hotly contested with Campbell leading the field in fundraising for January.
Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, backed her former campaign aide and student in a Jan. 15 video published on Wu’s Twitter account. Wu previously stumped in Iowa for Warren’s presidential campaign.
In a statement to The Crimson, Warren said she is confident in Wu’s ability to be a mayor who “leads with compassion” and “gets out and does the work” to change lives.
"Bostonians can count on her bold, progressive leadership to confront our biggest challenges head-on,” Warren said. “I am confident that as mayor, Michelle will continue to fight tirelessly to make Boston a city of opportunity not just for some of our families, but for all of our families.”
Justin de Benedictis-Kessner, an assistant professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, said Warren’s endorsement will help distinguish Wu from the growing field of candidates, particularly in a “low-information” election like a mayoral race.
“I don’t know if it shakes up the race, but I would say that an endorsement like this is important,” De Benedictis-Kessner said. “In a place like Boston, that’s going to help her pick up more progressive voters, I would expect.”
Warren’s endorsement came just days after Sunrise Movement Boston unanimously voted to support Wu, citing her commitment to a Boston Green New Deal. Sunrise — a national youth climate advocacy group — had previously backed Wu’s campaign for city council.
Robert M. Pittsley, a spokesperson for Sunrise, said Wu is “a perfect candidate” for the group because of her focus on environmental justice and equity.
“Sunrise believes that Michelle Wu is the best candidate for Boston because over the years, she has been a partner and has proven that she is looking at taking on the challenges that Boston has to take on,” Pittsley said. “We have a very good relationship with Michelle Wu, and we believe that her life experience and her policy going into these next very important years are a really good fit for our vision.”
Though Wu continues to pick up significant endorsements, Campbell outpaced her in January fundraising, reporting $270,289 against Wu’s $267,130.
De Benedictis-Kessner said the two candidates' abilities to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions cements both as clear frontrunners in the early stages of the race.
“Those are both really strong numbers,” De Benedictis-Kessner said. “It’s exciting to see a race that people care about and that people are willing to donate to because they think that these candidates have something to say that’s substantial, and they can change the direction of the city.”
Campbell also received an endorsement from former Massachusetts First Lady Diane B. Patrick, wife to former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78. Campbell previously served as an attorney in the Patrick administration.
One of the most radical shifts in the race was Walsh’s nomination as Labor Secretary, De Benedictis-Kessner said.
“It opened up a spot for some other candidates to step in who were probably not thinking about it,” De Benedictis-Kessner said regarding Walsh. “Him stepping out of the race opens things up in a way that I think can make it a race that’s available or open to candidates who aren’t going to raise as much money, don't have as high of a profile already, that aren’t already in elected office.”

A common piece of advice upperclassmen give to incoming freshmen is to avoid relationships. Normally, it’s a weird dynamic having a s/o during your freshman fall: you’re trying to build new platonic relationships; you’re partying; you’re taking on a rigorous academic/extracurricular workload. There’s just no time! However, this year, we’ve seen so many frosh leaving campus in a relationship. (WHY?!?!) The simple answer is our experience is a bit... different. Don’t worry, we’re amazed too.
The Zoom DMs
Many freshmen claim they were approached by their s/o in the ZMs. With all online classes, it should be obvious that relationships would stem from them. Frosh were desperate to make friends ~or~ maybe something more than friends. Thus, we traded the “wanna grab coffee after class?” irl for “wow, your hair looks really good today!” in a private message. Everyone knows the excitement of receiving a DM on Zoom... BUT to receive a flirty one: how could you resist?! This phenomenon of a “Zoom Crush” is not just a Harvard phenomenon, as the Washington Post claims that other college students around the country are experiencing them as well. (Hey — at least we aren’t alone in shooting our shots!).
Quarantine Bae
The cancellation of Visitas meant frosh had to find some interesting ways of meeting their incoming class – suddenly, the class GroupMe was the hottest place to be! Bigger group chats led to smaller group chats, which sometimes led to individual messages. Many claim that they bonded with their s/o all quarantine with tons of texts and late night FaceTimes— only to simply seal the deal when getting to campus. So unlike some upperclassmen experiences, freshmen had been talking to their person intensely since March/April. They felt like they knew them really well, making it really easy to take it to the ~next level~ when coming to campus.
Covid Cuffed
Let’s be real — the most obvious reason so many freshmen are cuffed is due to the pandemic. Loneliness right now is majorly prevalent. Commitment isn’t as scary when we think about how much we’ve lost this year! Why wait? You’re in desperate need of someone you can depend on or just have fun with — to hopefully bring you some joy in this stressful time. Muriel Dol ‘24 claims she didn’t have a problem committing because she didn’t want any “situationships.” She didn’t want to worry about someone who wasn’t hers when she was in a new environment about to meet lots of people.
A lot of the issues with getting cuffed freshman fall is the possibility of committing too soon before you meet everyone — this year, that’s simply not the case. There’s no parties or big gatherings (at least there shouldn’t be) where you feel like you’ll meet someone else you’re interested in. It’s hard to meet people in person, and even harder to make close relationships with social distancing guidelines and masks. So, when frosh met their person and vibed… there was no hesitation!
Somehow, freshmen have truly become the trailblazers for the latest quarantine relationships on Harvard’s campus. Is our class just more lax and open to commitment? Or is the pandemic inspiring these traits? Who knows! Nevertheless, the frosh seem happy, and that’s all that matters<3 xoxo, flossip girl

Mostly B’s: Quality Time
If you chose mostly B’s, there’s nothing that makes you feel better than quality time with the people you love. You don’t mind waiting in line forever at Shake Shack if it means spending more time with your boo. And studying in Lamont isn’t (as much of) a chore when they’re with you<3
Mostly C’s: Words of Affirmation
“[insert name] has endorsed your skill on LinkedIn” means even more than “I love you.” Mostly C’s mean you cherish that your partner tells you how much they care about you, whether that means shouting over the noise in Tatte or telling you, “yeah, you do look good in your fake Canada Goose.”
Mostly D’s: Physical Touch
If you chose mostly D’s, cuddles are the way to your heart. You don’t mind crowded places like Zinneken’s, where you have the excuse to snuggle up to your boo. And an extracurricular where you show care through physical contact is right up your alley.
Mostly E’s: Receiving Gifts
If you chose mostly E’s, you’re high maintenance… and what about it? Thoughtful gifts are the easiest way to find (buy) the way into your heart. Everyone wins — you (with your new gift) and your boo (because they’ve got you)!
