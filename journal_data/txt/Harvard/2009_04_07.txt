After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Report on Harvard House Renewal released last week promises to give students everything from 24-hour dining halls to more soundproof bedrooms. The House Program Planning Committee has gone to lengths to address a broad array of problems, involving both the structure of the Houses themselves and the general organization of House life. The major initiatives laid out in the report seem positive and, if renewal proceeds along these lines, prospective students can look forward to joining better-equipped, more cohesive Houses.
Many proposed improvements concern aspects of House life that students have complained about extensively, and their inclusion indicates that the planning process is responsive to student concerns. Notably, the report addresses the lack of social spaces within Houses. It notes that dining halls should not be the only place to hold large functions nor Junior Common Rooms the only student “hangout” space in a House. Any student who is tired of bumping into soda machines on Saturday nights or has attempted and failed to book one of the overscheduled JCRs for an activity will no doubt appreciate this. Aside from social space revamping, many of the report’s other recommendations, such as restructuring the workload of House tutors and eliminating walk-throughs, have also been long-awaited. 
We are pleased to see such a great number of student concerns being tackled at one time. This success may be due to the student-heavy makeup of the Planning Committee. Of its five subcommittees, two were made up entirely of UC-vetted students. University Hall made the right decision in structuring the process to include such significant student involvement, and we urge that student involvement be a priority as renewal plans proceed.
Nevertheless, moving forward, there are a few other important items that should not be ignored. While the renovations are taking place, constructing desirable swing space for displaced residents is essential. No student should feel as if they cannot partake in the benefits of the House system because of the unlucky timing of their college years. Housing renewal should not come at the expense of a satisfactory living experience for such students. In order to avoid this scenario, swing space could contain special amenities, as has been the case at other schools, in order to improve the lot of those having their Houses renovated.
Additionally, we maintain that horizontal floors in place of vertical entryways would make an important design improvement. Vertical entryways are an idiosyncratic quirk of our housing design that have outlived their usefulness in fostering social unity. While vertical entryways may be a characteristic feature of Harvard’s dorms, they should be scrapped in favor of more conventional horizontal hallways, which provide better opportunities for socializing among neighbors.  It seems counterintuitive that the Planning Committee is investing in better social spaces within the Houses while neglecting the deleterious social effects of the space within which students spend a majority of their time—their rooms and their immediate vicinity.
Finally, it appears that some of the report’s recommendations can be implemented now. Improvements such as restructuring the Senior Common Rooms or changing the roles of House tutors are good ideas, and they don’t require any walls to be knocked down. Moreover, if such bureaucratic adjustments are made before the Houses are renewed, it will make the transition process from old House to new House more stable. Redesigning the House life experience should not be artificially confined by a building schedule. We hope to see the report’s suggestions put in place as quickly as possible in order to maximize the benefits of this admirable piece of student-administration collaboration.

In a somewhat different case of global warming, employees in The Boston Globe office this morning might be sweating a bit more than usual for this time of year in New England. Anxieties in the print journalism industry have reached new heights, as The Boston Globe faces potential closure after 137 years of publication. The paper’s ownership, The New York Times Co., has suffered substantial losses from The Globe and has stipulated that union members must agree to $20 million in cuts or the newspaper may be terminated.Aside from The Globe’s prominent position as the largest newspaper in New England, the paper is also renowned for high quality news coverage and strong investigative reporting. Globe coverage has served a necessary role in researching and reporting on issues pertinent to readers in our region. For example, the paper recently exposed a dubious Massachusetts health insurance deal, and gave voice to public demand for the resignation of corrupt state senator Dianne Wilkerson. By virtue of its undeniably high level of journalism and important public function, The Boston Globe demands preservation. In addition to The Globe’s quality reporting, the paper fills an essential niche of focused local reporting and creates a level of local scrutiny and accountability that cannot be matched by papers with a national focus. Furthermore, a distinct New England newspaper lends a crucial cognizance of Boston’s history and context that a simple New England section on The New York Times website, for instance, never could. A nationalized media source would be unable to provide the same good as The Boston Globe.
Of course, financial constraints mandate cutbacks, and the reality of the situation necessitates considerable action. However, as opposed to closing the entire institution, other options should be considered. Termination of the print edition, for example, would be much preferable and could cut sufficient costs to allow Globe reporting to be upheld in its online format. Although The Globe’s average weekday circulation has dropped considerably, its online readership has seen substantial growth over the past year. Despite financial woes, there is still a demand for Globe reporting. Of course, maintaining The Globe in its current format would be ideal, but preserving the paper online should be the main priority.
Ultimately, the final decision about the fate of The Globe rests with its unions. The prospect of considerable wage cuts is an unfortunate reality for union members to confront, but the terms offered by The New York Times Co. are undeniably preferable to the total loss of jobs and wages that would accompany the closure of the newspaper. The unions should consider their own immediate and long-term interests, as well as those of their paper, and be willing to accept substantial cuts. Print journalism faces a wide range of challenges in today’s changing media environment, but newspapers must bear sacrifices now just to survive long enough to address them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I opened Monday’s email from Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, entitled “January Experience Announcement,” I breathed a deep sigh of relief. The College, at least this year, has decided not to offer any classes or organized internships during the new five-week stretch, instead allowing students to plan their own breaks. Harvard students will finally get that long January vacation that their friends at other colleges have always taunted them with.
Yet, predictably, many students are crying foul at this announcement as a missed opportunity for further College-directed programming opportunities. A stress-free break—what seemed for me to be the crown jewel of calendar reform—has irrationally become, in the eyes of my peers, yet another epic administrative blunder. 
Five weeks of unstructured break may indeed seem excessive; many lament the lack of guidance offered in terms of how to spend this time. This criticism, however, illustrates the severe level to which Harvard students seem to have internalized the need for an unwaveringly structured and regimented college experience. I personally find it liberating to have the ability to determine on my own how to spend the break, without the pressure of official Harvard suggestions or guidance looming over my decision-making process. If organized alternatives had been offered, the unhealthful Harvard climate of always keeping up with our stressed-out peers would arguably invade this J-term, just as it does everything else.
After all, there is no such thing as mere “guidance” offered by the College—if the school had offered suggestions as to how to spend the five weeks of break, they would implicitly have become mandatory directives, thanks to Harvard’s competitive nature. If Harvard had “recommended” meaningful travel, non-traditional electives, or internships, a student who might otherwise have cried “Sweet reprieve!” at the thought of a mental-health vacation would have felt obliged to comply with such recommendations out of guilt. 
Indeed, while offering other academic offerings and experiences would have been useful and fun, an unfavorable rift would have divided those who chose to take advantage of such extra options and those who decided to stay home; a negative stigma of perceived laziness would persist around those who chose to enjoy a long, stress-free break instead of opting for a J-term course. Students should not be punished (materially or psychologically) for wanting to enjoy a long break. The deans’ letter’s mere mention of using this January time as a potential means of “making connections” is cringe-worthy enough.
On a practical level, adding more structure to the January Experience seems implausible and contradictory to the College’s financial-aid initiatives. Would non-traditional electives be tuition-free? Would Harvard subsidize exploratory “see-the-world” travel just for the sake of it? Without a dramatic funding increase to finance such holistic January experiences, students on financial aid would largely be shut out; to them it might seem more purposeful—and necessary—to stay home and find a temporary job than to rack up more loans for jet-setting and cooking classes. In the current economic climate, the College can’t afford to fund a JanEx, and the average financial-aid student can’t either. 
As such, I cautiously applaud the deans’ decision to remain hands-off. Five stress-free, unstructured weeks of time without impending exams around the corner is an exhilarating idea and a welcome departure from the old calendar. The only unfortunate part of the move not to offer classes is that it comes merely as a result of the financial crisis and not out of genuine administrative concern for students’ mental health. The perfect five-week break should be self-determined and uncompetitive—even if the College is able one day to devote money to hashing out details, official recommendations, and a structure for this January break, it should continue instead to leave it up to the students.

If one word summed up the mindset of those in the American environmental movement, it could be “stop.” They advocate a stop to polluting, a stop to driving, a stop to eating meat, a stop to buying large cars, and a stop to using fossil fuels—in short, a stop to doing everything that American culture demands. They call for a stop through laws or technological standards with little explanation of why it is necessary to stop this behavior.
This is not a new attitude in the environmental movement, but it is one that must be changed. Global warming is far too complex to solve with statutory regulations. If the environmental challenges that face the world now are to be successfully addressed, it will require the engagement of a much wider audience and greater focus on education than in the past. 
Historically, environmental protection has been the province—almost exclusively —of relatively rich white men and women. The lack of involvement from inner-city and minority communities is one of the greatest failings of the movement. While environmental justice issues involving these communities have garnered increasing concern in the last several years, the problems with engaging a broader audience run deeper than environmental justice issues. 
These communities need to be included in the movement, not because of the environmental justice concerns that they are a part of, but because they represent a majority of the population. Without their support, the environmental movement will fail to successfully address global warming problems and all of its implications. Statutory regulations can solve air pollution when the majority of pollution is caused by industries that can be regulated. But global warming is a problem that is far more pervasive. It can only be addressed if individuals make the decision to change their behavior. This is not possible if the majority of the population is ignorant of the challenges. 
A recent Pew poll found that, among the public, global warming ranked last of 20 possible policy problems. More importantly, however, the poll found a serious disconnect between concern over the environment and global warming. While it is heartening that the environment was not listed last, it is worrying that people see a difference between the environment and global warming. These two policy problems are inextricably linked, and dealing with one means dealing with the other. That this poll separates them indicates a serious lack of understanding of the problem. 
People cannot—and will not—protect what they do not know or understand. The general lack of understanding is what underlines the importance of changing the focus of the environmental movement. In order to successfully engage these communities, environmentalists can no longer rely upon scientific innovation and legal roadblocks. To actively protect the environment, policy requires engagement from groups outside the traditionally active white suburbanites. 
Making the investments necessary to create engagement in inner-city communities will require a titanic paradigm shift within the environmental movement. Currently, the five largest traditional environmental groups have a budget of $325 million.  Yet only $49 million of that—barely 15 percent—goes to environmental groups that work with lowincome and minority communities.  There can be no disparity between these numbers if new communities are to be brought into the environmental movement. 
Rather than demanding that people protect the environment by introducing it through education programs, environmentalists have the opportunity to motivate people to protect it for the same reason that the environmentalists do: because they have an understanding of, and legitimate concern for, it. While it may be easier to tell people not to do something, making them not want to do it is a more effective means of protection.  
True protection calls for a reevaluation of how the value of the environment is assessed. The environment is not a luxury good, and by some estimates it contributes $33 trillion to the global GDP, so it can no longer be treated as an unnecessary amenity. But the reevaluation requires massive cultural shifts, which, yet again, require education, not new laws. 
This will not be easy. The environmental movement has, for a very long time, been a group on the margin of American public policy and one that has not tried to engage outsiders. Their methods have worked passably well thus far but will no longer be sufficient. Global warming will not be legislated away, and concern for the environment cannot be demanded in the same way that a catalytic converter can be required. 
Education and outreach must play a larger role in the environmental movement, and this begins with increased investment in those organizations that work with low-income and inner-city communities. This population has been ignored for decades by the environmental movement and only recently received attention. Now, the challenges facing the world demand that this attention not only be continued but also be increased.

As a general rule, I do not like Twitter. I have never been a fan of virtual persona platforms such as Twitter, LiveJournal, blogs, and even esoteric Gchat statuses. Call me old-fashioned, but I cannot understand why anyone would care to know ordinary details of a person’s life as captured in 140-character messages on Twitter.  Of course, to every rule there is an exception. Mine is Shaquille O’Neal, or “THE_REAL_SHAQ” as he is known on Twitter.  My obsession with Shaq’s Twitter started slowly. It was February, and I was in the throes of thesis-writing. While many of my friends were taking full advantage of senior spring, I would go to Lamont every day after class and stay until I got a few hours’ respite in bed. One day I got an e-mail containing a link to Shaq’s Twitter. I deleted it. Much as I detest Twitter, I have almost as little interest in basketball.  But when I received the link again, I reluctantly clicked on it. The description in his bio said, “Very quotatious, I perform random acts of Shaqness” and his most recent Tweet assured readers, “u guys aren’t lil people, we r all from da same planet, twitteronia.” Huh? This couldn’t be the real Shaq. But I was intrigued.  On February 22, Shaq shared one of his deep personal fears: “I hate leprekons lol.” Later that day, another update: “I had a nokia e90 but it fell n da toilet, now I have a shaqberry lol, I’m a toilet twitterer.” Well. It seemed a bit early in our acquaintance to know such private details, Shaq, but as long as we’re sharing secrets, I slept in my sister’s bed for three weeks after I watched The Omen. I wanted to tell him this, but of course, I couldn’t without a Twitter account.  A few days later, Shaq posted this note at 3:03 a.m.: “IF u r reading this, u shud b ashamed ov yourself, u shud b sleep,go 2 bed I say.” At the height of our thesis slumps, my friends and I read this as it was posted. Shaq, I thought, my mother would thank you for caring about my sleep deprivation. I would typically follow your advice, but my bibliography is only half done!  For the next few days, I willfully checked THE_REAL_SHAQ each time I took a thesis break. Shaq wrote about everything from his travels with the Phoenix Suns (“I’m n cal a forn eye. A.”) to Shaq-ifying everyday words (in addition to the aforementioned shaqberry and shaqness, Shaq has also expanded my vocabulary to include “Shaqsomnia” and my personal favorite, “Shaqntifficaly impossible”). He shares the joys of victory (“u all were my good luck charms today, I appreciate u guys”) and the pains of defeat (“A loss on my birthday, hong kong fuey, aghhh, agggh, agggh”). I can understand where you’re coming from, Shaq. My last attempt at basketball may have been in eighth grade, but I have taken midterms on my birthday every year at Harvard.   It’s hard to say why I got hooked on THE_REAL_SHAQ. It might have been the random, personal confessions, or the innovative language, or the direct conversations with many of his more than 500,000 followers. When Shaq was at the Alamo a few weeks ago, he said he was going to buy a squirrel tail hat; after one desperate follower begged him not to, Shaq listened, writing, “ok for u I wnt buy it.” (PETA would be proud, Shaq!) For whatever reason, I started counting myself as Shaq’s unofficial 544,644th follower, although given my Twitter-less status, I suppose I was engaging in furtive eavesdropping rather than a conversation with him.  Sometimes, I wish that my online friendship with Shaq were not so unbalanced. When Shaq wrote that he was “watchin the maury povich show, I’m not the father, schwwwwww,” my self-imposed silence was frustrating. Shaq, I wanted to ask, have you seen the Maury clip about the three pacifiers? That’s a question to which I’ll never know the answer, but he’d probably get a kick out of that video.  Reading Shaq’s Twitter sometimes feels a lot like playing a game of Mad Gab. A friend and I once discussed the various options of what Shaq could possibly mean when he wrote, “Went to a horse style cirk us dolay show called cavalia, very impressive.” Hmm. Cirque du Soleil?! I may not have gotten farther on my thesis conclusion that day, but I felt accomplished knowing that I had figured out that one.Of course, we don’t always get the satisfaction of deciphering Shaq’s tweets, like when he asked for help identifying the song “weee weee wha weee weee wha weee wee weeee.” Shaq, I spent a good portion of my afternoon Googling multiple versions of those lyrics, singing them at different pitches and speeds, and even contemplating the significance behind the number of “e’s” in the last 3 “wee”s. Not that I would have been able to post an answer in my still Twitter-less state, but I’m sorry I wasn’t able to help, anyway.   I realized the full extent of my addiction when Shaq didn’t update his Twitter for a while (did you drop your Shaqberry in the toilet again?) and then wrote mainly run-of-the-mill tweets (why are you pulling away like this?). I realized at this point that his Twitter had become relatively indispensable to my daily schedule.   Why? I wondered. Why would the combination of Twitter and basketball (neither of them appealing on its own) interest me? I don’t think these things are supposed to work like double negatives. Perhaps it’s because I wouldn’t expect many of these updates to come from an otherwise imposing seven-foot-tall, 325-pound world-famous center. Perhaps it’s because his Tweets are genuinely funny; Shaq isn’t afraid to poke fun at himself for his unconventional writing style (he once wrote “Stay tuned—prepare for SHAQ to ‘enlyten’ you!!!”).   Or maybe, since I’ve relegated Twitter as a tool for overly introspective musings, it’s refreshing to see someone use it in a lighthearted way and play with people’s passion for him. Shaq often offers tickets to the first person who can find him in a particular location—“tag me and say yur twit u hv 20 min.” Both punny and generous? You are too kind, Shaq.    Then again, maybe I am fascinated with Shaq’s Twitter because it offers a glimpse into the daily affairs of a “celebrity.” But I’m not sure this is it either. I don’t read John Mayer’s or Ashton Kutcher’s Twitters, and I can say with certainty that I own more John Mayer songs and have watched more Punk’d episodes than minutes of basketball (Shaq playing or not).  I haven’t yet figured out why I’ve bookmarked THE_REAL_SHAQ, and I don’t really care to. Unlike just about everything else in my life that I analyze—thesis arguments, post-graduation plans, the Yankees’ chances of winning lucky number 27—I’m happy simply to accept Shaq’s Twitter for what it is. Thesis or not, it’s just nice to have this outlet for laughs.   And if Shaq ever informs his Twitter following that he is in Cambridge and gives us 10 minutes to find him, you can be sure my friends and I will do our best. Not because we have a particular hankering to see a basketball game, but simply to say thanks for the “random acts of Shaqness.”—Aditi Banga ’09 is a Senior in Lowell House and former Crimson Design Chair. She plans to spend next year performing random acts of Shaqness.

Administration officials announced yesterday that the College will not be offering any “January Term” programs next year, a revelation that comes nearly two years after Harvard first decided to alter the College calendar to include a “J-Term.”Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that the financial situation has forced the College to abort its previous plans to offer programming for the “January Experience”—as it has come to be known.Planning for the period was in its early stages; Assistant Dean of the College Inge-Lise Ameer had recently been appointed to lead planning for the period, and no concrete plans had yet been announced.“We are concerned that mounting a new, compressed, short-term set of offerings in January—particularly at a time when resources are highly constrained—would in fact distract from the College’s focus on other more central aspects of the undergraduate experience,” Hammonds and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote in the e-mail to the College community yesterday afternoon.Hammonds said that students hoping to stay on campus during the January Experience period will be required to submit an application showing a “need to be on campus,” which will then be reviewed by senior staff in the College. She said that after the decision was made not to provide programming, administrators did not want idle students to remain on campus.Hammonds said that varsity athletes are the clearest example of undergraduates who will be allowed to stay, but the deans’ e-mail announcement suggested that “international students, thesis writers, students conducting lab-based research, and others who cannot reasonably accomplish their work in another location” may also be permitted to remain on campus.According to the announcement, the College will close on December 22, one day after the last fall semester final exam. On January 10, those with approval to be on campus during J-Term will be allowed back into the dorms. No other students will be able to return before January 23. Hammonds hesitated to say for certain whether or not all dorms and houses will remain open during the January period, but said that the College would consider this issue after it decides which students will be allowed to stay on campus. She added that Annenberg will be the only dining hall open during the period. There are also no plans to charge lower room and board fees for students who will not be allowed to stay on campus for the two weeks in January, Hammonds said. The idea for a J-Term was first suggested by a 2003 committee charged with reevaluating the current University calendar, a group chaired by Professor Sidney Verba ’53. The Verba Committee developed a new calendar that consisted of two four-month semesters separated by a one-month break.But calendar reform subsequently fell by the wayside amid a focus on the pending curricular review and the controversies of the Summers administration. In spring 2007, the Undergraduate Council renewed the discussion, calling for an undergraduate referendum on calendar reform­ and proposing a plan that deviated from the Verba report in omitting the J-Term.At the end of that academic year, interim President Derek C. Bok announced that the Harvard Corporation had approved a plan modeled on the Verba committee’s original outline.Bok had written in his announcement that plans for the time between early January and the start of spring term would be left to the discretion of individual schools.—Staff writer Lauren D.

Most freshmen and sophomores registered satisfaction with their freshman and sophomore advising in the College’s mid-year advising survey, the Advising Programs Office reported at a presentation to the Undergraduate Council yesterday.More than 90 percent of sophomores are satisfied with their House advising, and between 80 and 90 percent of freshmen found their Peer Advising Fellows helpful and accessible, according to a statement by Associate Dean of Advising Programs Monique Rinere after yesterday’s meeting. The survey, which solicited student opinion on the freshmen advising program, the Peer Advising Fellows program, and the sophomore advising program, has served as a check-up of sorts for the Advising Programs Office since its inception in 2006. Both the PAF and the sophomore advising program, which delivered overwhelmingly promising results, have been instituted only in the past couple of years.“It’s very gratifying to have these new programs serving our students so well,” APO Assistant Dean Inge-Lise Ameer said.The freshman advising program also drew favorable reviews, with most respondents describing their advisers as helpful, accessible, and approachable, according to Rinere. The response rate among freshman was over 80 percent, while it was only just over 50 percent among sophomores, Rinere said.The meeting was intended to begin a collaboration between the APO and the Undergraduate Council that would educate the Council on the history of advising. Despite the glowing figures, at least one of the six UC representatives in attendance remained unconvinced of the survey’s accuracy.Sarah B. Honig ’10 said she was impressed with the survey results, but added that the statistics might be inflated since the survey was conducted by the administration. Students may have been reluctant to give their advising experience low ratings for fear that their advisers would suffer consequences, Honig said.“They’re very impressive, but again and again, all we hear anecdotally is how unsatisfied students are with advising,” Honig said. “Something doesn’t seem to match up.”Senan Ebrahim ’12, another UC representative in attendance, disagreed.“Overall I felt it was pretty reflective of student opinion,” Ebrahim said. Not all of the statistics were available on the record.No major changes are in the works for the Advising Programs Office, but the office is working with the Council and is open to student ideas and advice, Rinere said.“We absolutely welcome their ideas, their creativity, their participation in everything that we do,” Rinere said.The UC is brainstorming advising ideas at their meetings this semester and will continue to collaborate with the APO, Honig said.One of the ideas Honig mentioned was an academic advising center similar to the Office of Career Services or the Bureau of Study Counsel.Honig added that yesterday’s presentation gave her an appreciation for the progress the APO seemed to have made since making its start three years ago. “I was surprised to learn about how much has changed since 2006, and how awful the program was,” Honig said. —Staff writer Danielle J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, nine subcontracted custodians tried to clock in for work at Harvard Medical School. Although their layoffs were effective last Friday, the custodians showed up for their normal shifts, ready to work, as part of staged protest.More than 25 Harvard undergraduates, law students, medical students, and union members escorted the workers through the back entrance to Gordon Hall where they were met by security and administrators who told the protestors that they had three to four minutes to exit the building.“We’re from American Cleaning, and we want to work,” custodial workers told an administrator sitting behind a sign-in desk.American Cleaning Company—a subcontracted cleaning service that has worked with Harvard for the past year—was told by University officials in February that working hours would be significantly cut, which has translated into company layoffs. Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-09, a member of Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement who participated in the protest, said that the Harvard layoffs have occurred in decentralized chunks.Aguilera added that there has to be a priority that is more important than Harvard’s endowment.“These are not just notches on a budget, these are people’s lives and families,” she said.After the workers had attempted to clock in, they retreated to a basement hallway. There, protestors held hands and presented the laid off workers with bread and roses which they said represented livelihood and dignity, respectively. “We are one community,” said Daniel B. Becker, an organizer for Service Employees International Union Local 615, which represents custodial workers at Harvard. “We are with you, and you are with us.”After the ceremony, Robert E. Christiano, the associate director of campus operations at HMS, escorted the protestors out of the building.Benjamin J. Oldfield, a medical student, said that he and other students will continue to fight to reemploy the workers.“Harvard says it has trimmed all the fat and the layoffs are a last resort,” Oldfield said. “This is something that, as students, is hard to reconcile with the excesses we see on campus.”Ana Guevara, one of the laid off workers, said through a translator that she has no plans for future employment through American Cleaning. She has not heard from the company since she received a letter terminating her employment.Guevara said her work as a housekeeper was her only source of revenue. “Without [my job], I don’t have anything,” she said through a translator. “I have my rent, car insurance, regular bills for me and my family.”Guevara said that she had been studying to get her GED through a bridge program with Harvard, but because she will no longer be affiliated with the University, she will have to leave the program after this semester. Reina Coto, another laid off worker, said that American Cleaning Company sent mixed messages about its plans for layoffs. According to Coto, the company mentioned that people would be laid off, but a week later told Coto she could stay. Two days later, she said, the president of the company told her he had made a mistake because there was another worker with more seniority.“I feel like they are playing with our feelings,” she said through an interpreter.The layoffs were especially frustrating for Coto because many workers had gone above and beyond their normal duties, she said. Occasionally workers would cover two or three extra floors when other workers were absent—sometimes with extra pay, sometimes without.Richard M. Shea, the associate dean for Physical Planning and Facilities at HMS, said he had never heard that workers had not been paid for their work.“I would expect people to be paid for that,” he said. “I would not expect people to work for free.”Shea said that HMS is still trying to figure out ways to help American Cleaning redeploy its workers. He said that there have not been any definite plans for future layoffs, and that future decisions are will be contingent on the University-wide early retirement packages and other budgetary decisions. —Staff writer Laura G.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences cautioned yesterday that it was still too early to state how many staffers are participating in its early retirement incentive program, leaving the figure—which will be crucial in making determinations about possible layoffs—a mystery as the 45-day window for deciding on the package came to a close.    
The final numbers will remain unclear until early next week, since staffers who have accepted the package will still have seven days to change their minds, Robert P. Mitchell, the Faculty’s director of communications, wrote in an e-mailed statement yesterday.    
But despite the silence, administrators are not working without any planning assumptions, according to Engineering Professor Frederick H. Abernathy, who said that FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Brett C. Sweet has acknowledged an expectation that 14 percent of eligible staffers would take the package.  
According to Abernathy, who said the statement came in response to a question he posed at a talk in late March, Sweet added that he had made the projection because a similar package offered at Dartmouth was accepted by about 14 percent of eligible recipients. 
Sweet declined to comment for this article, and the Dartmouth News Office could not be reached for confirmation of the figure late last night, but The Dartmouth, the University’s student newspaper, did report in February that almost 15 percent of eligible staffers had accepted the school’s offer of a retirement package. Just three weeks after Dartmouth’s deadline for accepting the package, the University’s administration announced that they would be laying off 60 staffers.
FAS officials said at a meeting with administrators in February that following Harvard’s deadline for acceptance of the package, the University would reassess budgets before beginning any discussions about layoffs with the Office of the General Counsel and human resources officials.
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which includes over 1000 FAS staffers, said that his union would also be actively involved in talks with the administrators if layoffs are broached in the aftermath of the retirement package, and would look to find an alternative to job cuts.  
“There’s a provision in our agreement for consultation and serious discussion with our Union and affected employees in any situation where Harvard considers changes that would result in layoffs,” Jaeger said.
Jaeger added that, as the Union waits for the numbers on the retirement incentive program, many believe that the scheme may have distinct benefits.
“A lot of people are hopeful that this program’s going to give us options and flexibility and help to minimize layoffs,” Jaeger said.
With the window for acceptance of the retirement package now closed, it remains unclear for departments whether having a staffer retire is a curse or a blessing.
Susan R. Suleiman, chair of the literature and comparative literature department, said that the retirement of the literature concentration’s administrator, Barbara J. Akiba, will make up a “decent chunk” of the 15 percent budget cut that the FAS administration has requested of all departments.
“The fact that Barbara has retired is a sort of gift to the department,” she said, adding that it has helped the small department avoid having to make any “slash-and-burn decisions.”
But Theodore C. Bestor, chair of the anthropology department, said that in light of a slow-down on staff hiring this fall, he would see a staff retirement within the department as a loss as well as a saving.
“It would mean that somebody we rely on would suddenly not be there,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Union representatives and members of the Harvard community petitioned the City Council yesterday in response to the University’s low-wage worker cuts. The resolution that came before the Council proposed an economic stimulus package in which the City of Cambridge would exempt Harvard from its payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT). The resolution’s sponsor, Counsellor Marjorie C. Decker, said that the resolution is a symbolic method to highlight the absurdity of the layoffs. At the last Council meeting, Decker said she thought this type of gesture would shame Harvard into halting layoffs of low-wage workers.Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-09, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting.  “As students who live and go to school at Harvard, we know that workers are as much a part of our community as faculty and administrators,” she said. “We hope that the Council will join students in putting pressure on Harvard to stop laying off workers and keep our community together.”Bedardo Sola, a janitor who was recently reinstated at the University, said through his translator that he now understands what it is like to be enslaved after having taken up the workload of three workers. Counsellor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, the second sponsor of the resolution, motioned to vote on the resolution at a later meeting.“[Harvard’s] behavior is not Veritas behavior, it is embarrassing and pitiful,” said Reeves. “It’s just not fair for a multi-billion dollar university to take bread out of children’s mouths. Hopefully we can see some more enlightened leadership in the future.”Harvard’s offer of early retirement may be perceived as coercive by workers who feel pressured by the possibility of layoff, said Stephen A. Helfer, a support staff member at Harvard Law School library.“I ask the City Council to use its influence to urge that everybody at the University  take a pay cut according to his or her ability, starting with Drew Faust,” he said.Director of Higher Education at the Service Employees International Union Wayne M. Langley suggested that Harvard follow the example set by similarly-affected universities like BU and MIT. He said these universities have acted responsibly in postponing layoffs and offering modest increases in salary to low-wage workers while cutting wages for the highest paid workers. “The bottom line is that Harvard is a non-profit subsidized by taxpayers and we expect a higher level of responsibility from them,” Langley said. “The message they are sending to workers on the bottom of the food chain is that they are surplus and not central to the educational mission of the school.”—Staff writer Danella H.

Harvard’s restoration of three old mansions on the Harvard Law School campus in 2007 drew the Cambridge Historical Commission’s Preservation Award last Thursday, lending a dose of prestige to the aged structures where 26 Law School students currently reside.The award, bestowed annually for historically accurate restorations of Cambridge-area houses, recognized the Law School’s work on a trio of 19th-century Victorian mansions, which were updated and moved 150 yards from their original sites to make way for the school’s Northwest Corner Project—a construction initiative aiming to create new classrooms and student spaces, scheduled for completion in 2011. The three wood-front mansions—1637 Massachusetts Avenue, 3 Mellen Street, and Baker Hall—served for the first time as residences for Law School students this year.The rich history of the three houses motivated the Law School to preserve their original exteriors, while the interiors—which had been renovated numerous times—were gutted and subsequently remodeled to accommodate student housing.Douglas J.D. Walo, the Law School’s housing administrator, said that the buildings were “difficult to work with,” due to their age and period style.Walo added that even though the houses have been almost entirely refurbished, the buildings still maintain their Victorian style. He noted Baker Hall’s stained glass windows, and all the houses’ woodwork as examples of continuity.“It’s hard to replace that sort of old craft,” Walo said.In the 19th century, when the houses were constructed, Massachusetts Avenue was the most prestigious street in Cambridge, said Charles M. Sullivan, the executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission. Merchants, who traveled through the Porter Square railroad station, contributed to the wealth of the area. At one point, 69 wood-front mansions lined the avenue, Sullivan said.But the area began to become more commercial in the early 1900s as the city’s population grew. According to Sullivan, there were no apartments or stores on Massachusetts Avenue until 1914, posing a stark contrast to the shop-lined hub that tourists see today.“It was very important to preserve this history,” said Sullivan of the street’s residential character.1637 Massachusetts Avenue is the largest of the restored wood-front buildings, and once housed a Ukrainian research institute before Harvard acquired the property. Now refurbished, it contains 11 apartments for residential use.

Food experts dispelled the notion that locally-grown food is necessarily more costly and explained the recent  interest in sustainability at a panel discussion yesterday hosted by the Harvard Culinary Society, Real Food Harvard, and the Food Literacy Project. Panelist and History of Science professor Steven Shapin, who teaches a class on the “History of Dietetics, noted the “immense popularity of food porn,” attributing the increased interest in ingredient origins to the media’s recent focus on the culinary world.“Fewer people sit down for a meal or cook every day, and thus are concerned about what they are eating when they are not at home, like at restaurants,” he said.At the same time, television shows have made food preparation “exotic, fascinating, [and] with a touch of alien,” according to Shapin.The event, entitled “The Locavore’s Dilemma: Eating Locally in New England,” was held in the Fong Auditorium and attracted only a few dozen audience members.In addition to Shapin, the panel featured John Lee, the General Manager of Allandale Farm, the only farm within Boston’s city limits; Peter Davis, the Executive Chef at Henrietta’s Table; and Martin T. Breslin, Harvard University Dining Services’ Director for Culinary Operations. The panelists addressed the cost issue of buying food from local venues such as farmers markets, and Lee stated he doesn’t understand the false perception that locally-grown food is more expensive. “In studies that compared eating fresh-grown local food  to [eating] processed food, grown food is actually cheaper,” Lee said.But Breslin said that the price tag of sustainability depended on the scale of the operations and the types of food required.“Everything I want to do is purchased locally because it is cost-neutral,” he said. “If it is more, it has to be driven by student body because it is extremely expensive.”“There comes a point when it costs so much more money and other parts of a meal would be sacrificed,” Breslin added.For students who are moving beyond HUDS dining halls, Davis advised outgoing seniors to purchase locally, since food preparation is “all about the ingredients.”“Don’t be afraid to cook...and support farmers markets,” he said. “Look at what looks best and let the market tell you what you will eat.”

A Harvard School of Public Health study recently showed that obesity leads to a significantly greater risk of periodontal disease—a severe form of gum disease that causes bone destruction and periodontal tissue inflammation.“This is one of the first, if not the first, study demonstrating such a significant relationship in such a large group of people,” said Frank B. Hu, professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology at HSPH.The association found in this study can be of “substantial public health importance,” said Hu, who was a co-author of the paper.Monik C. Jimenez—a fifth year doctoral student at HSPH and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine who was the study’s principal researcher—said that she hopes the knowledge of this link will lead dentists to play a more active role in educating their patients about their overall health.“I think dentists...have an obligation and a duty to connect with their patients,” said Jimenez. “The mouth is not a separate organism from the rest of the body.”Athanasios I. Zavras, an associate professor of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at HSPH and HSDM with international public health policy experience in the World Health Organization, also underscored the importance of the study’s potential impact on the role of dentists.Since periodontal disease is one of the most common dental diseases and since obesity has become a global epidemic, “if we can understand the mechanism linking the two, we can potentially affect the prevention of periodontal disease and management,” Zavras said.“This is a great starting point,” he added.The study’s researchers said they believe that the link is fostered by adipokines, or inflammatory chemicals secreted by fatty tissue.Increased adiposity, measured by higher waist-to-hip ratio, leads to increased production of cytokines, which are thought to promote periodontal disease, according to Hu.Hu said he hopes that results of this study will eventually help scientists better understand the biological mechanisms that cause gum disease.Data used in Jimenez’s analysis was collected as part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, an HSPH longitudinal study funded by the National Institute of Health, which has been following over 51,000 male health professionals since 1986.In a similar study, Jimenez also found a strong correlation between obesity and increasing risk of periodontal disease in the elderly population.Jimenez presented her findings at the 87th General Session of the International Association for Dental Research held in the Miami Beach Convention Center.—Staff writer Helen X.

The insanity that is Annenberg at dinnertime had a new twist this evening.  As opposed to being greeted by long tables of dining classmates, frosh were instead greeted by long tables of peppy advisers.  That’s right, kids, Harvard is once again doing what it does best… "advising" the crap out of overwhelmed undergrads!
Tonight’s event in Annenberg marked the start of Advising Fortnight--two weeks of random events hosted by professors, TFs, and students from various fields of study.  Though these kind folk will attempt to guide you in your quest for the perfect concentration, beware young froshies, for you will most likely end up more confused than you were before receiving their illuminating counsel.  More guidance, after the jump.
The theme that the Advising Programs Office has selected for this two-week journey of self-discovery/non-discovery?  “Chart Your Own Course.”  Some words of wisdom from the Advising Fortnight homepage: “Think of your life at Harvard like navigating an ocean. You can steer your ship any way you’d like to go, and there are infinite paths that guide you to your destination.”  If FlyBy had tear ducts, its eyes would be moist right now.
At least a few ambitious freshmen were excited about the prospect of getting to discuss their academic plans with the available advisers.  When asked what tables she had visited, Hyojung Hong ’12 replied, “The ones that didn’t have lines that were too long.”  Well, maybe they’re not that ambitious.  Come on 2012.  Step up your game or you might end up like this.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Been feeling lonely without FlyBy lately?  We've had a little too much Senior Bar, and too few annoying-as-hell section assigments (how do those things always take five times longer than they should?).  But duty calls--nothing can trump wasting time staring at a computer screen until the sun comes up.
Crappy day to be out and about, eh?  Didn't even get to J.P. Licks like you planned to?  Got driven from the Sci Center earlier than you wanted?  It's ok...you know what they say about the best laid plans. FlyBy is sure you're dry and cozy now--even if things are still not going according to plan.
In the meantime, reflect on how (un)lucky you are you don't have the free time to turn herding sheep into an art form. Check out more from that Schick commercial series: this time, more overt and more awkward. Get excited for INCREDIBAD.
If none of this works for you, just get lost in the randomness: whether crack-induced, or not.

Prefrosh: would you like to have some idea of what classes you'll be required to take in the next four years?  If you're going by the Harvard viewbook, you may not know that Harvard is undergoing its first curricular overhaul in over 30 years, and you'll be the first class to fall under Harvard's new General Education program.  The viewbook's vague and contradictory information follows after the jump.
On page 33, the viewbook reads:
The first sentence is the usual Harvard spiel about how much flexibility everyone has with their schedules (though freshmen in Life Sci, Ec10, and Justice may beg to differ).  Granted, it doesn't sound blatantly wrong.  But then why would they mention the Core Curriculum to the class of 2013 when they won't be falling under the Core at all...?  If the viewbook is bothering to mention the Core, they are going to explain the transition to Gen Ed right about now--right?
Right.  After explaining that everyone at Harvard takes classes in the Core Curriculum, the viewbook describes Gen Ed in enormous detail:
One course from each of the following 8 areas: 
Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding
Culture and Belief
Empirical Reasoning
Ethical Reasoning
Science of Living Systems
Science of the Physical Universe
Societies of the World
The U.S. in the World
If I were a prefrosh, I would feel like I know so much about Gen Ed.  Are these a restricted group of classes or courses that can be drawn anywhere from the (online) course catalog?  How is Gen Ed different from the Core in structure?  In philosophy?  What is Gen Ed supposed to be all about?
Being a brilliant high school senior who just got into Harvard, I would be able to guess all of this from the categories alone.  It's called being ready to B.S. your way through any section at Harvard.  Too bad if I listed these categories to my high school friends or AP Statistics teacher, I'd get one of the names wrong--it's Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, not Empirical Reasoning.

Sometime yesterday afternoon, you should have received some longwinded e-mail regarding some "January Experience Announcement" from our dean-friends Mike Smith and Evelynn Hammonds.
Because some of you may have other things to do than read such stimulating blocks of text, Flyby has parsed all 686 words of wisdom and translated what Mike and Evelynn actually mean by, say, [insert any one of the convoluted 39-word sentences peppered with double-speak]. Translation after the jump.
Dear  Students, Faculty, and Staff,
This is about J-Term.
As you know, we usually kick you out for the non-denominational holiday break and rifle through your belongings to find contraband microwaves, but next year, you will no longer be welcome back on campus come January. That is, unless you have a "recognized and pre-approved need" to be back frolicking through the empty dorms and houses.
So... despite hints of our mysterious-but-grand plans for a "January Experience," we are actually not going to go through with (un)said plans and offer any J-Term programs. But why this abrupt change of cancellation of  plans?? Well, we realized that even half-assing "new, compressed, short-term set of offerings in January" would actually take time that we do not have, since we have to, like, figure out what the deal is with University finances. 
But fear not! We are going to ease this disappointment by telling you that Gen Ed and the Freshman Seminars haven't been cut! Relief, am I right?!
We are also going to list a bunch of random programs and unrelated initiatives and spout empty words about our commitments to fill up space. As you may have noticed by now, this message could have ended two paragraphs ago.
Let's add more words about how we deans believe that you will in fact find something exciting to do with or without our help, such as hole up at home watching reruns of Project Runway, but pay for room and board anyway.
And we suppose we will try to be better organized the following year by taking notes, but this J-Term debacle was totally not our fault! We've never done anything like this before!
XOXO,
Mikey and Evelynn
P.S. Signature update! "Dean of Harvard College" now precedes "Barbara Gutmann Rosenkrantz Professor of the History of Science and of African and African American Studies" to reflect the shift in my priorities! <33

Ever wondered if HUDS actually has those legendary underground tunnels for channeling soups and sauces to various dining halls? Or pondered whether your breakfast pizza is actually just last night’s dinner drenched in a copious portion of scrambled eggs? If so, you’re in luck: the UC is now raffling off tickets to behind-the-scenes tours of house kitchens, no gold wrapper required. Find out how to win a foray backstage after the jump.
According to UC weekly newsletter, two of the HUDS tours will be open to the general student body, and will be held on Friday, April 10 and Tuesday, April 14 at 10 a.m.
Judging from the e-mail, the opportunity may not be appropriate for those with delicate stomachs:
“Sign up to go beyond the servery and see how Dining Services makes your food. If you want to know how the food you eat every day is prepared starting from Step 1, this is the tour for you!”
Unless reading The Jungle was a particularly uplifting experience, FlyBy would caution students against, ahem, partaking in this opportunity. As Anna M. Yeung ’12 puts it, “I have nothing to gain. I would probably just lose my appetite.”
Students can enter the lottery by filling out a survey by Wednesday, April 8 at 11:59 p.m.
