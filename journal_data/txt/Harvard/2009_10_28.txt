After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking at MIT on Oct. 26, President Obama besought MIT students and students at colleges all across America to tackle the “challenge of their generation” by pursuing research in alternative fuel sources and technologies and other methods of combating climate change and obtaining independence from foreign sources of oil. We appreciate the president’s calling upon young people to engage the critical issue of energy independence and hope that students at MIT and other universities answer this call. We also endorse the current effort on Capitol Hill to pass climate-change legislation. However, we urge lawmakers not to resort to the specious and politically convenient answers of ethanol and clean coal, the inefficient and experimental favorites of special interests, and recognize that nuclear power must be an integral part of any comprehensive solution to this crisis.Since the infamous Three Mile Island incident in 1979, there has been a de facto moratorium on the construction on the construction of new nuclear plants in the United States. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is currently reviewing applications for 26 new reactors, none of which would be constructed before 2016. Hurdles include draconian environmental regulations, a shortage in the supply of nuclear components and qualified personnel, and the lack of willing investors.This status quo is unacceptable. Nuclear energy is far and away one of the most powerful weapons in our arsenal for cutting emissions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, constructing 180 new reactors would cut emissions by 80 percent by 2050. Even Energy Secretary Steven Chu has also expressed support, even if somewhat lukewarm, for the nuclear approach, endorsing in September additional loan-guarantee authority for nuclear power and saying that, “If you really want to restart the American nuclear energy industry in a serious way...we [need to] send signals to the industry that the U.S. is serious about investing in nuclear power plants.”Fears about the safety of nuclear power are outdated; since the Three Mile Island incident, there have been no new major accidents either here or in France, whose 59 nuclear reactors provide 90 percent of its power. Furthermore, the security concerns are more than balanced by the enormous benefits in terms of the jobs that would be created through the construction and maintenance of these reactors, the improvements in our energy efficiency as a nation, the ensuing energy independence, and the enormous progress in lowering emissions and combating climate change that would result.Few other energy sources have so much potential to become the silver bullet to our energy woes. Wind and solar power together could not provide 90 percent of France’s electricity, as nuclear power does, nor could they allow the country to become the largest exporter of electricity in the world, as it currently is. Even in the United States, 104 nuclear reactors in 31 states already provide a fifth of our electricity and 70 percent of all our non-carbon-emitting power.Yet even if one remains hesitant about nuclear technology in principle, there remains political reality to consider. On June 26, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the American Clean Energy Security Act, which creates a “cap and trade” system to establish an economic disincentive for carbon emission by requiring polluters to pay a fine to the government or to other smaller polluters should they pass a certain emissions benchmark. As soon as the votes were finished being counted in the House, conventional wisdom declared the bill dead in the Senate, where it faces overwhelming opposition by Republicans and considerable opposition by Democrats hailing from coal-producing states. Among the latter is Montana Senator Max Baucus, who said, “We cannot afford the unmitigated impacts of climate change but we also cannot afford the unmitigated effects of legislation.”Recently, however, prospects for the Senate climate-change bill written by Senator John Kerry and Senator Barbara Boxer have improved. The reason, no doubt, has been a compromise over nuclear power in which key Democrats have agreed to offer it as a concession to court the votes of Republicans, including John McCain, George Voinovich, Lisa Murkowski, Lamar Alexander, Richard Burr, and Lindsey Graham.Graham co-wrote on article in The New York Times Oct. 10 with Senator John Kerry endorsing a climate-change initiative in the Senate, and in the article both senators made clear their support for the inclusion of a nuclear component in their comprehensive climate change strategy, writing, “We need to jettison cumbersome regulations that have stalled the construction of nuclear plants in favor of a streamlined permit system that maintains vigorous safeguards while allowing utilities to secure financing for more plants. We must also do more to encourage serious investment in research and development to find solutions to our nuclear waste problem.”It is clear that a number of these senators will only vote for the bill should a concession for nuclear energy be included. McCain, who championed nuclear power during his failed presidential bid, put it rather bluntly: “I can’t negotiate without a robust nuclear provision.” Murkowski, likewise, said, “The only way we get there...is if we really ramp up nuclear.”Climate change is too urgent an issue to allow opposition to nuclear power to derail the Boxer-Kerry Bill, likely to be the only legislation comprehensive enough to tackle the issue that we will see for many years. The McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 was defeated 60-38 in the Senate by senators like Boxer who voted against it due to its nuclear provisions. Now is not the time for a repeat of this embarrassing setback, without which we would have been tackling the climate crisis head on for the last four years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Shuttle service isn’t the only thing being scaled back this year. Last week, the College Events Board announced that instead of hiring a high-profile performer for the Harvard-Yale pep rally, it’s opting for a more low-key event focused on student performances and the football team. But you know what? I’m still really excited about it. And it’s not because I am a huge fan of the football team or because I can’t wait to see the Dance Step team in action. In fact, I don’t have any specific reasons for being so eager to take part in this celebration of school pride—I just happen to enjoy the experience of being at a pep rally.
My excitement has nothing to do with any natural emotional loyalty to educational institutions or their sports teams. I’ll be the first to admit that I simply don’t identify with whatever feelings prompt my friends at other schools to post rallying cries such as "Go Cats! F**k ’em up!" on their Facebook statuses. I cannot claim more than a moderate interest in football as a sport, and I probably won’t fall apart if Harvard doesn’t win the Ivy League championship. But the great thing about school spirit is that it requires no rationale or justification. I deck myself out in Harvard gear and cheer loudly at games mainly because I feel it’s the appropriate thing to do at a school event—and because it’s fun.
If this seems like a totally illogical line of thinking, it may be because the entire concept of "school pride" is inherently irrational. "Spirit" is a manifestation of camaraderie among individuals who may very well have nothing in common except for shared affiliation with a group, be it to a college, a House, or a class year. All too often I hear fellow Harvard students trying to treat spiritedness as if it needs a deeper explanation—"I think there would be so much more House spirit if housing was nonrandomized and I could live with people who shared my interests." They don’t seem to realize that the whole point of House spirit is to connect students who wouldn’t otherwise have anything to do with each other. As contrived as it may seem, House spirit and school spirit enrich undergraduate life by encouraging a sense of community among otherwise highly individualistic people. It’s nice to feel a sense of solidarity within the student body that doesn’t come from complaining about how much work we all have.
If we choose to, we can make all sorts of excuses for not having school spirit: We won’t have a big-name artist at our pep rally to be excited about, tailgate rules at Harvard are too puritanical, we’re too cynical to mindlessly demonstrate support for our school. Getting an outside performer for the pep rally or allowing kegs at tailgates may make those events more appealing, but it doesn’t create school spirit. Last year I could barely see Girl Talk during his abbreviated time onstage, and the frigid weather made it difficult to hang around the tailgate parties for very long. And on the day of the Game, most of my friends missed the one and only touchdown scored because they came five minutes late. But none of it mattered all that much, because the real excitement of these school events comes from being surrounded by a huge cheering crowd of other Harvard students during one of the few times we aren’t embarrassed to be sporting head-to-toe insignia clothing. Students themselves create that intangible electricity in the air that constitutes "spirit."
So on a chilly Thursday night in November, I’ll be making my way up to the Yard without any concern for the entertainment value of the pep rally itself. I’ll go because there are few other occasions that allow me to shelve my self-consciously independent tendencies and wholeheartedly yell out silly chants, hopefully joined by a crowd of fellow students bold enough get in touch with their rah-rah side.

Can you even remember the last time you actually read a book?
Sure, you read—you might even do it quite often. But what you probably do when you “read” a book these days is to skim through it, skip around chapters when you can, and hunt for the book’s key ideas before moving on to the next title on your list. And while time constraints and a general unwillingness to expend intellectual energy are certainly not conducive to thorough reading, let me suggest that the reason you haven’t really read a book since, say, the eighth grade is not entirely your fault. After all, this is the Information Age, an age that values the immediate dissemination and processing of information, and that—whether we like it or not—has impacted the way we read.
A rapidly growing demographic of constantly connected individuals with scant patience for traditional media is emerging in society. According to the Radicanti Group, a Palo Alto-based market research firm, there will be roughly 139 million wireless e-mail users by the end of 2009, a figure that will rise by an average annual rate of 68 percent until there are one billion users by 2013. True, these data have nothing to say about the number of books these users read in a year or about the way in which they read. Yet they nevertheless sketch an outline of a burgeoning group for which even a DSL connection on a regular computer is a much too slow and inconvenient means of accessing e-mail. And while there has been no such survey, it’s fair to say that this rising demographic also illustrates (at least to some extent) the concomitant development of a new type of reader, for whom a traditional book—a sequential stream of text between two covers—is a hopelessly antiquated means of making a point.
Although it’s difficult to pinpoint the origins of this new group of information-age readers, recent innovations in the publishing world confirm—if not explain—its existence. Meet the “vook,” which, according to a description on the company’s website, “is a new innovation in reading that blends a well-written book, high-quality video and the power of the Internet into a single, complete story.” Recently, Atria Books, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, has teamed up with Vook to release several titles that readers can watch online or through iTunes. And the vook is not just an example of a technological innovation that could bring more information to more people; it’s also a product that caters to the modern reader, an individual who seems to have lost the stamina required to sit down and digest the entire contents of a book.
In a recent New York Times piece, Tufts University’s Maryanne Wolf, author of “Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain,” feared the trend the vook might encourage: “Can you any longer read Henry James or George Eliot?” she asked. “Do you have the patience?”
History is full of examples of a new medium that changes the way people read and think. If the vook is to be one of these era-shifting media, it’s worthwhile to look back at the impact of preceding innovations. In “The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution,” historian Roger Chartier describes the impact of the “tripling or quadrupling of book production” on French readers in the decades before the revolution and how “a new way of reading, which no longer took the book as authoritative, became widespread.” In this era, the new innovation, so to speak, could be called the individualized text—the pamphlet or the periodical or the easily reproducible book, which allowed people to read on their own time and by themselves, which, as Chartier argues, made pre-revolutionary Frenchmen into more critical thinkers who would no longer tolerate the inadequacies of the ancien régime.
But what effects will our reading innovations—the vook included—have on today’s reading public?
Not unlike their 18th-century French counterparts, readers today face a large and growing pool of information, but I don’t see readers (if they can even be called that anymore) becoming more analytical as a result of the many recent developments in reading technology. If anything, these products seem merely to make us read faster, less carefully, and in such a way that we can no longer absorb anything not presented in an easily digestible form such as video clips or embedded MP3 files. After all, is a vook something we “read” or something we “experience”? In my mind, the distinction is an important one.
In the sense that they enable us to condense a book’s main points into a small, palatable package, innovations like the vook essentially encourage us not to read at all, for the act of reading is a sustaining intellectual process that requires scrutiny, time, and—above all else—thought. And what kind of thought is required in to “read” something like a vook?
If the rise of the vook provides an occasion to deliver any sort of eulogy, the eulogy must not be for the object of the book itself, but rather for the traditional reader—an essential but tragically uncommon character in the narrative of this Information Age.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I click on the ad, and a giant face invades my computer screen. The image appears as a simultaneous zooming-in and zooming-out: the model’s features are larger than life but stripped of detail, her poreless skin punctured by demurely parted lips. Stare at the picture too long and it becomes grotesque, unrecognizable—like writing the same word too many times and realizing the arbitrariness of its character combinations. “Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline,” the image teases, refusing to betray the source of that ineffable “it.” The text seduces with the intimation of natural beauty, the promise that the model’s looks are real, authentic, and fully hers—then punctures its own illusion. Perfection and porelessness are, after all, impossible. The natural can only be posed as a question, as an indeterminate “maybe” rather than an affirmative reality. In its ambiguity, artifice becomes immaterial: indistinguishable from nature, makeup and Photoshop themselves become natural.
This paradox grounds the modern beauty industry, which goads women to buy in order to look more like themselves. These ads, hawking goods like “Clean Makeup” and “TruBlend Microminerals,” entice women to wear products in order to appear as though they are not wearing makeup at all. More than simply selling beauty, cosmetics companies are pedaling authenticity itself. Beauty, the message runs, can only be beautiful if it is effortless. Enlisting external aid is fine, so long as that aid reflects the natural and remains invisible. By this reasoning, Photoshop and foundation become problematic only when their effects are too obvious—when they assert their presence, rather than reveling in their own negation.
The makeup industry is not the first to commoditize authenticity. Take, for example, indie music, which derives its identity by opposing the alleged mindless conformism of the mainstream. To listen to [insert esoteric name here] is to refuse the proverbial “shoveled shit” of the major record label. Obscure musical tastes serve as markers of sovereign choice and, therein, as guarantees of authenticity. The problem is that, in branding the alternative, indie becomes mainstream. Marketing its own version of “cool,” indie music is often produced by media conglomerates and premiered on primetime television. The cultural outsider—in this case, the affluent, white college student—now constitutes a niche market whose cache corporate executives seek.
Advertisements geared toward the university demographic seem to share indie’s sensibilities. Eschewing conformity and mass-manufactured coolness, they tell us to be unique, to follow our own grains in the wood; Levi’s “Go Forth” campaign comes to mind. But there’s the rub: Coolness comes not from authenticity—that self-conscious choice of individual identity valorized by indie culture—but from consuming, à la Urban Outfitter’s prefab chic. The indie and commercial are not autonomous; given indie’s status as a style cultivated through material goods, such autonomy is impossible. As in the Maybelline commercial, authenticity is revealed as a product, a mere object for sale in the market.
Whatever names the concept assumes, the status of the authentic as a credible cultural alternative is under attack. The problem is not necessarily that the authentic has sold out, but that the mainstream has bought in—in the case of the cosmetics industry, by literally packaging the natural and selling it en masse. Playfully posed, Maybelline’s catchphrase sounds innocuous enough. Yet, in its conflation of the real with the ideal, the slogan belies its ostensible innocence. Predicated on an understanding of the real, it transforms the ideal—the model’s made-up face—into the measure of the real itself. Flawlessness, attainable only through artificial means, becomes more natural than nature.
Prompted by fear over the loss of the real, French parliamentarian Valérie Boyer recently introduced legislation that would require images produced for the public sphere—from advertisements to campaign posters—to disclose their digital enhancements. If Boyer has her way, a written disclaimer will undermine the perfection of these pictures, much like the surgeon general’s health warning on cigarette packs. Imagine inserting the proposed phrase—“photograph retouched to modify the physical appearance of a person”—below Maybelline’s famous slogan. The allure of the “maybe” would be lost, the model’s beauty disenchanted: Whatever that “it” is, its origins in makeup and Photoshop would be affirmed.
By asserting the insincerity of the image, without then showing the image in its unmodified form, would the disclaimer merely perpetuate Maybelline’s mystique? The warning reads, in some sense, as a rearticulation of Maybelline’s catchphrase. As the ad declares, the model’s beauty may be artificial, but who cares? Substituting the terms “born with it” and “Maybelline” for “real” and “unreal,” the ad articulates our anxieties over the blurring boundaries between the two and allows women to appropriate this ambiguity for their own ends. Puncturing without a positive solution of its own, the disclaimer comes across as empty words. Our imagistic angst, it seems, can only be resolved (or, more likely, exacerbated) with time.

Though it is best known by just three small letters, this fall the A.R.T. has started to achieve a much bigger presence within the Harvard undergraduate community.
The American Repertory Theater is by no means a newcomer to Cambridge. According to Thomas S. Lee, Program Manager of Learning From Performers in the Office for the Arts, the A.R.T. was established in 1980 by Robert Brustein and gradually began to develop a relationship with Harvard undergraduates.
However, under the guidance of new A.R.T. Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus ’87, Lee notes that there’s been a recent shift to forming even closer ties with Harvard College.
“I think we’re really committed as a theater to playing an essential part in every student’s life at Harvard,” said Paulus.
TAKING CENTER STAGE
The A.R.T. is refashioning Shakespeare for the Harvard student and reaching out to undergraduates through academic channels. English 128: “Dream, Theater, Shakespeare”—which meets the General Education requirement for Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding—fills the Fong Auditorium every Tuesday afternoon. The class is taught both by Paulus and William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of English and of Visual & Environmental Studies Marjorie Garber, who is also Chair of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies.
The class reads three Shakespeare plays—“A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Macbeth,” and “A Winter’s Tale”—and students are obligated to attend three A.R.T. performances—part of the A.R.T.’s Shakespeare Exploded festival—during the semester.
According to Antonio J. Hernandez ’11, who is enrolled in English 128, attending A.R.T. adaptations of Shakespeare plays helps enliven the classroom experience. “It makes you more interested when you’re reading to say ‘Oh, that’s interesting—this witch thing would be really great if you adapted that…I wonder what’s gonna happen with that when I see it performed.’”
He also explained that the theatrical element of the class attracts members of the undergraduate theater community.
“You go in the class and you see people who [you] know are interested in theater production and these people will one day probably be some great leaders in the arts world,” said Hernandez.
In addition, The A.R.T.’s Institute for Advanced Theater Training is reaching out to the undergraduate community. The five-semester professional training program that encompasses a residency at the Moscow Art Theater School is teaming up with the Office of the Arts this year and inviting undergrads to participate in an intensive two-week theater training program during J-Term.
THE DRAMA COMMUNITY
While the A.R.T. has begun to reach a larger audience of undergraduates through courses such as English 128, for certain subsets of the Harvard community, the A.R.T. has consistently been a significant presence.
According to Mia P. Walker ’10, director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club’s (HRDC) production of “Grease,” “If you do student theater under the umbrella of HRDC, you’re automatically really working with the A.R.T.”
Still, she explained that the close relationship has recently gotten closer, and Walker said that she recognizes a “sizeable difference” in the relationship between Harvard and the A.R.T. during the three and a half years she’s been at Harvard.
“There was no liaison between the students and the ART,” she said, “but now I feel like there’s a lot more connection.”
According to Walker, who’s also  a Crimson arts writer, every student production on campus is given an A.R.T. mentor. Walker’s mentor last year attended rehearsals, tech week, and even frequently met for coffee to give her advice.
But Walker also notes the A.R.T’s broad appeal for students who might not normally consider attending performances.
“People who I would never thought would go see shows, I see them at the ‘Donkey Show’…People I never expected are talking about the A.R.T.,” said Walker.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
According to Paulus, the Harvard-A.R.T. relationship is likely to get even cozier in the future.
“[The A.R.T.] has been outreaching to the University to open the art for the students to get involved for the productions,” Paulus explained.
She also noted that the A.R.T. is attempting to reach out to Harvard students even after graduation by providing opportunities to continue their theatrical work at the
A.R.T.’s Institute for Advanced Theater Training.
“People who were very involved as undergraduates in theater are now having the opportunity to take the next step after graduation and work at the A.R.T. as part of their training and profession,” said Paulus.
After all, as Paulus stated, “we are a part of Harvard and we are eager to provide a cultural center for Harvard University.”

At the Girl Talk concert last year, I left feeling happy and satisfied. I spent the majority of my time being a team player and doing some aggressive people-crushing. I hit someone on the stage in the head with a glowstick. I spent the rest of the time wondering about the delicious bowl of macaroni and cheese in my hands—had HUDS just impulsively served dining hall food because it was feeling really socially awkward in a concert setting? Or did I not get something about concerts?  I at least ‘got something’ about people-crushing. But even then, I felt like there had to be something more to this whole concert thing.
Perhaps we all should just admit that, on that cold Cambridge night in the Old Yard, the whole concert felt a little bit like HUDS: out of place. Now, if it had instead been “Girl Jam: a jam-a-capella re-jam of our favorite jams”, we probably would have really kicked back, and, well, jammed. But, though we may jam, perhaps we were just never meant to concert.
For one, there’s something to be said about doing a thing right or not doing it at all. Boston, with its multitude of real concerts, is a mere ten minutes away. In the mean time, back here, we can do what we do best: watch student groups perform, drink, and then try to act really drunk in front of that girl in our section who laughed at our joke that one time.
As for student turnout in the absence of a big name artist?  Please!  Everyone knows to show up for the review session the night before the big test—how else would we ever learn the players, team color, and mascot name of our football team? It’s going to be crucial to act all knowledgeable and football-ey at Yale the next day, while trying to act really drunk in front of that girl in our section who was impressed by how drunk we were at the pep rally that one time.
Moreover, not having an artist now will mean more money to spend on an artist for Yardfest—and thus heightened feelings of injustice and persecution in the spring when we hate that artist.

Certainly, nothing pumps up the Crimson football team and its fans like standing in the freezing cold waiting for a concert to get cancelled. But this year, the College Events Board has decided not to book a “star” performer for the Harvard-Yale Pep Rally. Fear not, though, pep rally diehards, this year’s event is sure to promise a sufficient amount of disappointment.
For one thing, the pep rally will still feature the Harvard cheerleaders, who are sure to impress with a few very difficult cartwheels and toe touches.  There also will be some sort of inter-house competition, which will definitely star several over-eager section kids. As the Harvard Band plays the one song it knows (I’m sure you’d recognize the fateful tune), the rally is bound to be a bore—unless, of course, someone gets hurt.
I might venture to say that the best part of last year’s pep rally was watching the organizer of the event getting pelted with glow sticks, and then thinking that telling everyone to stop would definitely work. Without that public humiliation to look forward to, there’s no way I’m going this year (though with Harvard student dance groups slated to perform, the potential for said humiliation may be higher than ever).
And so, for those who can’t think of anything else to do on that Thursday night, I would recommend organizing your clothes according to where they were made, painting your ceiling, or pulling your leg hairs out one by one.
The good news is that now, with no musical act booked to set up to play and then get cancelled, my friends won’t be able to convince me to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Foreign Minister of Austria Ursula Plassnik will join the Institute of Politics as a visiting fellow this week.
As Foreign Minister, Plassnik addressed the expansion of the European Union and the growing significance of Islam in European affairs. Her name is now among those mentioned for Foreign Minister to the EU, a post that would be created under the Lisbon Treaty, which aims to reform the workings of the EU.
Plassnik sat down for an interview with The Crimson yesterday to talk about new developments in European politics.
THC: How do you think the notion of religious pluralism will play out in Europe’s future?
UP: As of now, there are 20 to 30 million Muslims in the European Union. This means that we already have to manage religious pluralism. My hope is that Islam in Europe will be a combination of European citizenship and attachment to the fundamental values of European societies and a religious identity as a Muslim.
THC: Austrians generally remain somewhat opposed to Turkish membership in the EU. Do you think this will eventually change?
UP: I would rather say that Austrians remain strongly opposed, not even somewhat opposed, to Turkish membership in the EU. We all agree that we should have as close as possible a relationship with our Turkish partners. We want a modern Turkey that adopts truly European standards, and this is what we’re currently negotiating with Turkey. There are a number of obstacles that have to be overcome, and, as of now, we cannot seriously determine whether Turkey will one day be a full member of the EU. I’m aware that our Turkish friends do not like to hear this message, but it is a message that I have been persistently giving to them. It’s not an anti-Turkish message, but it is a tone of realism.
THC: How much, in practicality, do you believe the EU nations will be able to subordinate their foreign policy to a common foreign policy under the Lisbon Treaty?
UP: Henry Kissinger requested a single telephone number for European Foreign Policy a long time ago. As of January 1, 2010, I’m convinced he will have such a telephone number. This does not necessarily mean there will be a single European foreign policy on all matters. There will be 27 national foreign policies as before, but they will be acting more and more in concert.
THC: If you are asked to serve as the EU foreign minister under the Lisbon Treaty, do you plan to accept?
UP: Let’s not go into speculation. From my experience, European foreign policy is still very much of a boy’s club.
THC: Do you believe Tony Blair is right for the post of EU President?
UP: I have never made a secret of my thinking on Tony Blair. I have experienced his leadership as a member of the European Council for a number of years, and I think he has extraordinary leadership capacity. Having made what some consider a major mistake in my mind does not per se disqualify a leader for future responsibilities. I think with his broad experience, including the failures, he could be a good choice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the task force examining Harvard’s libraries emphasized the dire structural problems confronting one of the University’s most cherished resources, causing professors to express concern about the health of the libraries in the face of potential consolidation.
At yesterday’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, Dean Michael D. Smith—who ominously repeated the phrase “demands on our library have grown”—said that the University must address the intense budgetary pressures confronting the libraries.
“I ask that we not spend today’s meeting criticizing the past or rehashing historical budgets,” Smith said. “I ask that we focus on the future. What ideas do you have? What are the key characteristics of a model that can be held up as a future of the library system?”
Even before the financial crisis hit the University last fall, the library system had struggled to find the necessary resources to sustain desired acquisition rates, according to Harvard University Library Director Robert C. Darnton ’60, who said that the libraries are “being bled to death.” Acquisitions fell precipitously last year, a problem compounded by the rising costs of periodicals and a long period of declining resources at Harvard, he said.
A number of professors said that further budget cuts could permanently damage the libraries’ core mission, since the libraries were experiencing neglect well before the financial crisis.
Amidst a weakened dollar—which drove up the cost of foreign purchases—and skyrocketingcosts across the board, and a stagnant unrestricted budget, the Harvard College Library’s operating budget has “effectively” decreased over the past decade, according to Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas.
The number of staff added to FAS over the past six years is roughly on the same scale of the entire Harvard College Library staff, which actually shrank over the same period of time, according to English department chair James T. Engell ’73. This year alone, HCL reduced its workforce by roughly 100 employees, including several acquisition librarians.
It appears more cuts are to come.
Smith wrote in his annual report released Friday that the administration hopes to “rebuild HCL with a dramatically smaller base of resources.”
“It’s hard to see how we cannot suffer damage if we are losing personnel—resources who are essential to our research and teaching,” Thomas said in an interview after the Faculty meeting. “How can you keep subtracting and claim that you’re somehow adding by doing that?”
A task force chaired by University Provost Steven E. Hyman has been charged with recommending changes to Harvard’s library system this semester. The group will release a finished draft of a report detailing preliminary recommendations in about two weeks, Hyman said yesterday.
Robert C. Darnton ’60, the HUL director, director of the Harvard University Library, said that the impending report should be viewed not as a “blueprint” for the exact structural changes to be implemented in the library system, but as a foundational “step in a process” where professors can outline priorities and suggestions—echoing Smith’s stated hope that the report serve as an “opening” for broader discussion within the Faculty.
“We’re in a very difficult situation—the economic crisis has brought it into crisp focus,” said Nancy M. Cline, chief librarian of HCL. “We cannot do all that we have done in the patterns of ways we have done it in the past.
One of the task force’s main goals, Hyman said, is to ensure that students and faculty have access to much of the world’s scholarly works “in perpetuity” by taking advantage of digital resources, but such access does not necessarily mean “ownership and preservation of everything.”
Darnton said that Harvard’s library system is in “active discussion” with MIT about the possibility of collaborating with the peer institution’s libraries, noting that “no serious library can go it alone anymore.” Harvard is also considering collaborative efforts with libraries outside of the country, according to Darnton.
“You have worked to raise the alarm,” Smith said about faculty anxiety regarding the status of the libraries. “Consider it raised.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The toxic agent found in cups of coffee that sent six Harvard Medical School researchers to the hospital last August was likely there on purpose, according to one of the victims.
Matteo Iannacone, a research fellow who has worked at the 8th floor laboratory of the New Research Building for more than two years, told The Crimson in an interview yesterday that he cannot think of how the chemical, a laboratory preservative called sodium azide, would have accidentally wound up in his and his colleagues’ coffee on Aug. 26.
“I just think it’s very difficult to find an alternative explanation for sodium azide in the water. That’s it,” he said.
Iannacone said he found out that sodium azide was the toxin along with three other victims last Thursday in a meeting with HMS officials. The other two victims were out of the country, he said.
While he qualified his opinion by saying that he does not have any specific evidence to support his suspicion, he said that those present at that meeting agreed that the poisoning could not have been accidental.
“When we had the meeting, that was the general consensus of everybody,” he said. “Nobody with a grain of salt thought it was an accident, but we’re still waiting for the police to make the call.”
Iannacone said he first felt symptoms almost instantly after sipping a cup of coffee at 3 p.m. with graduate student and fellow victim Lidia Bosurgi. He said he noticed a metallic taste and then felt a drop in blood pressure and an increase in pulse. Upon learning that four others had reported similar symptoms, he said he was taken to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in an ambulance.
A memorandum written by HMS administrators released last Friday said that all six victims were seen at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which contradicts what Iannacone told both The Crimson and the Associated Press. When asked about this apparent discrepancy, he said that he did not remember which hospital he attended and that it might have been Beth Israel.
Iannacone and Bosurgi both work under the supervision of HMS Professor Ulrich H. von Andrian. Both Bosurgi and von Andrian could not be reached for comment.
Julie E. Goodman, an adjunct lecturer in epidemiology at the School of Public Health and a toxicologist at Gradient, an environmental consulting firm, said that the victims were lucky given the deadliness of the chemical.
“The idea in this case with the poisoning is that people were fortunate that they didn’t have enough that could have killed them. They had enough that they were having some adverse effects, but not enough to be lethal,” she said.
HMS spokesman David J. Cameron said there were no new developments in light of Iannocone’s suspicions.
“I can’t really say anything to that other than what I’ve said before, that investigation going on,” he said.

A high percentage of American children have low levels of vitamin D—a deficiency that could lead to a host of health problems, ranging from respiratory diseases to weak bones to the common cold—according to a recent study from Harvard-affiliated hospitals and the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
The study found that almost one-fifth of American children do not have enough of the vitamin, according to standards set by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Almost 90 percent of African American children and 80 percent of Hispanic children were found to be vitamin D deficient.
According to Jonathan M. Mansbach—lead author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School—vitamin D is acquired primarily through sun exposure and food consumption.
He said he attributes the higher proportion of vitamin D deficiency among populations with darker skin tones to the greater amounts of melanin in their skin. As melanin impedes vitamin D production, it takes significantly longer for someone with darker skin to produce the adequate amounts.
But he added that the causes for the  vitamin deficiency are far more complex, including the increased amounts of time children now spend indoors, the widespread usage of sunscreen, and geographic location.
To remedy this deficiency, Mansbach and his fellow researchers said they strongly recommend that children take vitamin D supplements.
According to Mansbach, vitamin D research has grown very “hot” in the past five years as its significance in the body’s metabolic pathways has become more evident.
Deficiency of this crucial vitamin in children has been associated with eczema, wheezing, type 1 diabetes, and weakened bones.
“Although hard evidence showing that low levels of vitamin D lead to diseases or that high levels prevent them is lacking, this is an increasingly burgeoning area of research,” said Mansbach.
Data for the analysis was obtained from the 2001-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a comprehensive national survey of Americans. The study examined data from 5,000 children, aged between one and eleven.
The study—which was funded by the National Institutes of Health—was published online Monday by the journal Pediatrics.
A representative from the journal was not available for comment.

Jeffry M. Picower, an education philanthropist who invested billions in Bernard L. Madoff’s $50 billion Ponzi scheme, was found dead in his swimming pool after suffering a heart attack last Sunday—less than a year after his foundation pulled the plug on millions of dollars in promised funding for diabetes research at the Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals.
Some grant recipients still lack alternative sources of funding.
Last year, the Picower Foundation e-mailed the Harvard medical grant recipients days after the Madoff fraud went public and alerted them that the foundation had “ceased all grant-making, effective immediately.”
The foundation had awarded Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier $1.5 million last October to be spent over three years. It had also planned to donate $1.35 million to the division of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism at Harvard-affiliate Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Flier had divided the award among three or four researchers, according to Bruce M. Spiegelman, a professor of cell biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who lost two years of funding for research on fat cell regulation to be paid out in $300,000 yearly installments.
Spiegelman said he has not found any alternative funding to date.
“I’m looking at federal funds, non-federal funds, and looking to the Farber’s donors as well,” he said.
“The Farber development department has been working with me to see if there is anyone who will step into the breach.”
Spiegelman’s lab had just received payment for the 2009 year when the Madoff scheme was exposed and thus was able to maintain research this year using Picower funds.
“If there was one bit of good fortune, it was that we had just received the lastit was that we had just received the last year of funding when the foundation collapsed.”
One year later, the funding is about to run out.
“In the past 11 months, we did not see the effects of the lost funding until now,” he said.
“That’s a lot to lose in one blow, but that’s up to me to try and make up for that.”
Spiegelman said the Picower foundation’s donation was slotted for four or five years, and he believes he had two more years of funding left.
The foundation also gave $50 million in 2002 for brain research at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, at that point the largest single gift MIT had received from a foundation.

When Walter L. Condit returned from work on Monday to find police cars, fire trucks, and a bomb squad blockading Garden Street in front of his apartment, he had no idea they had been summoned to retrieve the cannonball sitting peacefully in his living room.
His wife, who asked that her name not be used, had called the City of Cambridge Police Department’s non-emergency hotline earlier that day. The couple said they had kept the cannonball on display under their television set since they found it in their closet a few years ago.
But when Condit’s wife became concerned about the possibility of an accidental explosion, she sought advice about potential safety risks from a local Civil War enthusiast, who advised her to have it inspected.
According to Alexa Manocchio, a Cambridge police public information officer, the Cambridge Police received a call around 5 p.m. that residents were in possession of an old cannonball. According to a Cambridge Fire Department report, fire department units were dispatched at 6:02 p.m.
Lisa M. Rama, public affairs officer at Naval Station Newport in Newport, R.I., said the police department had determined that the cannonball warranted a dispatch from the naval station’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal team.
Rama said Naval Station Newport is the closest facility to Cambridge that routinely responds to police department calls for assistance in removing explosive military material.
“Public safety is the primary goal,” said James F. Burns, public information officer for the Cambridge Fire Department. He said the department had responded to calls about old hand grenades and pistols but that this was the first cannonball removal he had encountered.
After a long period of photographs, questions, and examinations by the nearly twenty personnel at the scene, the cannonball was x-rayed and removed in an insulated container.
The cannonball is currently in a storage facility at Naval Station Newport. It will be properly detonated and disposed of soon.
Early news reports offered various explanations for the cannonball’s presence, such as that the couple used it as a door stop or tried to donate it to a museum. Condit said these reports about the shiny, brown cannonball were not true.
In fact, he and his wife disagreed as to how it made its way to their apartment. Condit’s wife said her husband found the cannonball on the street. Condit said it had been in their closet since they moved into the apartment over 20 years ago.
After all the commotion the cannonball caused, Condit said he was just “glad it’s gone.”
Rama said a lesson could be drawn from the incident. “This is a good opportunity for us to remind individuals that these things that people take as souvenirs are potentially dangerous,” she said.

Several prominent journalists described the problems faced by traditional newspapers in the digital age and touched on possible solutions at a panel discussion at the Barker Center for the Humanities last night.
The five panelists—affiliates of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard who were introduced as a “board of innovators” by the host Melissa Ludtke—gathered at the inaugural event of the Harvard Writers at Work Lecture Series to discuss the challenges of financing print journalism in an era when most people get their news online or through broadcast media.
Robert H. Giles, Curator of the Nieman Foundation, said that falling circulation rates indicate a growing interest in free news among the public, and as a result, waves of layoffs have hit many newspapers across the country.
“What [the public is] interested in is innovation in new technologies,” Giles said, adding that newspapers should consider developing differentiated “online ventures” to attract new investors with specialized interests.
While “the institution of the newspaper” deserves to be preserved in some form, said Alex S. Jones, Director of Harvard’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, it needs to find a “sweet spot” that balances circulation and advertising with an online presence featuring content that engages its readership.
“We’ve got to find a way to work with the revenue that we can generate,” Jones said.
Charles M. Sennott, a co-founder of GlobalPost—an online news organization specializing in international reporting—suggested lowering reporters’ salaries in exchange for giving them more freedom to pursue work outside the newspaper, such as writing books or screenplays.
If journalists are given the opportunity to do what they enjoy, Sennott said, news organizations will be more likely to publish articles that “enlighten and inform and entertain.”
Students who attended the lecture said they would have preferred hearing the panel propose more answers to the difficulties facing print media, rather than dwelling on the problems themselves.
Lakeisha N. Landrum, a journalism student at the Harvard Extension School, said she hoped for future events to focus on more specific solutions, rather than the different perspectives and nuances of the issues.
“We know the old model is broken,” she said. “The people that come up with the solutions will be the people that are going to be influential in our generation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all the optimism surrounding Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’s recent announcement about a windfall surplus in the school’s budget, some professors at yesterday’s Faculty meeting questioned the school’s health in light of the cutbacks that have occurred.
“There was and is some damage being done to FAS,” said James T. Engell ’73, chair of the English department, noting the staff cuts and cancelled faculty searches of the past year and referencing the contents of the Dean’s Annual Report, which was released on Friday.
“The beginning of the report says the crisis has done little to change our most important activities, but then later says the impact of the crisis on FAS has been immense,” Engell said. “It’s very hard to square the two in some ways.”
“I should probably keep my mouth shut, but I’ll respond anyway,” Smith said. “I guess I come from a slightly different personal approach to the world where I have aspirations that I wish to achieve each year, and if I have to adjust them, I adjust them.”
Smith said he would much rather be at Harvard—where administrators have bluntly addressed the economic downturn and reacted appropriately with cutbacks—than at other institutions that have yet to realize the reality of fiscal stringencies.
“So it’s not that I disagree with what you’re saying, Prof. Engell,” Smith said. “I very much agree that we are undergoing significant change—but I do believe that at the end this will be very good for us.”
A PRESIDENTIAL ABSENCE
Smith presented more details yesterday about a Faculty-wide mystery that had first come to the attention of professors last month.
At the Sept. meeting, Faculty Council member Harry R. Lewis ’68 directed eyes to a stark white space on the wall above University President Drew G. Faust’s head that had long been occupied by a portrait of former University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853.
A bewildered Faust had asked, “Where is President Eliot? Where has he gone?” At yesterday’s Faculty meeting, Smith came armed with answers for his leader.
The portrait was removed so that it could be repaired for damage caused by condensation and a “minor altercation with a flagpole,” Smith said, referring to a flag situated near the space typically inhabited by the former president.
Eliot’s portrait will likely return to its usual post on the wall of the Faculty Room by the next Faculty meeting in November, when “President Eliot will be imbued with a non-reflective glazing that will shield him from further harm,” Smith said.
HYMAN MAKES HIS DEBUT
University Provost Steven E. Hyman, who chairs the task force charged with recommending changes for Harvard’s libraries, sat in the front row at the Faculty meeting and was forced at one point to take the microphone in a departure from his usual silence.
“I have spent years trying to never have to speak, but here goes,” Hyman said as he rose to respond to a question about the libraries.
“Is this your debut?” Faust asked.
“Perhaps,” Hyman said. “I have very little memory.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rolling out of bed to the sounds of the marching band on JFK Street, I thought that this past Saturday was going to be a football game like any other.
Granted, with the visiting Princeton team was only sporting a 0-2 record this year, I knew that things would be a little different. But who doesn’t like watching your team demolish a foe that has been a perennial obstacle in each of the last three years on the road to the Ivy League championship? It was going to be a great day, and an epic win.
But as I stood on the sidelines ready to watch the Crimson stomp all over the Tigers, something else was very different as well: the stands were empty.
As Princeton’s Ben Bologna kicked off the start of the game, there were zero people in the stands in front of me. Z-E-R-O in all of Section 35—the traditional student section.
This is something I have never seen before in my time at Harvard (and as Saturday marked the 100th game that I’ve cheered for the crimson and white, I’ve seen quite a lot). Sure, some freshman and their parents filed in during the middle of the first quarter, but no fans for the first minutes of the game was a new low for Harvard. Making matters even worse: this weekend was Homecoming.
If my estimates are correct (and the brain break crowd at Kirkland dining hall comprises a sufficient sample of the Harvard student body), approximately 60% of you are saying to yourself, “Wait, Harvard has a Homecoming?” Yes we do, and yes, it was this past weekend. Organized by the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA), Homecoming was a complete failure. There were no student-centered events, no flyers, not even a banner at the game that heralded its significance. Unless you were involved with the game or had recently-graduated friends pass on information from the alumni mailing list, Homecoming robably flew right under your radar.
Remembering Homecomings that were done right—those back in the days of high school, with parades and dances and Pep Rallies—I was even more disheartened with Harvard’s failed attempt. Like the decisions to end hot breakfast and put those ugly chairs in the Yard, the exclusion of students from the Homecoming loop appears to be another major administrative mistake.
Bernie Zipprich ’09-’10, a transfer student from nearby Boston College, has seen both the best and worst of sports culture.
“I heard of homecoming through the alumni network and from friends who had graduated,” Zipprich said. “I didn’t hear much through the students unfortunately.”
This ignorance of Harvard’s first Homecoming in years also penetrated into the alumni population. J. Archer O’Reilly III, a defensive back for the ’65 Crimson, has rarely missed a Harvard football game during the past half decade. Yet, O’Reilly first learned of Homecoming during a reference in the band’s pregame show, and after speaking with other Harvard sports alumni, found that they too were out of the loop.
“[Homecoming] was a well-kept secret,” O’Reilly said. “I’m old enough to remember when Homecoming was a big deal—[the HAA] seem to be building this as an alumni event, which is unfortunate because Homecoming should be an undergraduate-centered event.”
While Harvard’s first attempt at Homecoming afforded little incentive for current students to ever want to come back for this event, the HAA may be on to something. Just as the annual Night Game has provided an unmatched beacon of Harvard school spirit, a properly managed Homecoming might be able to similarly stimulate student sports culture.
Recent graduate Danielle Rutherford, one of five members of the class of 2008 that attended the event, has a remedy.
“I don’t think anyone knew what [Homecoming] was, or what it was supposed to be,” Rutherford said. “Give a reason for it.”
If Homecoming is expanded to the undergraduate population in the coming years, the reason to return may become apparent. Until then, the Crimson faithful will have to endure the embarrassment of a vacant student section and a slipshod tradition.

Harvard men’s basketball may not carry much weight in the sporting world, but its head coach certainly does. Coach Tommy Amaker held his third annual coaches clinic Sunday, welcoming to Lavietes Pavilion over 100 hoops coaches from across New England.
Clinic participants—each involved with basketball at the high school level and below—were privy to a typical Crimson practice as well as a lecture from former NBA player and coach Doug Collins, who currently works as a broadcaster for TNT.
The day began with Harvard players going through warm-ups and various offensive and defensive drills. After only a week of practice, the team remains a work in progress—a fact made clear by its coach’s repeated shouts of “no silly turnovers!”
Amaker periodically stopped and started the activities to explain his coaching philosophy and answer questions from the audience.
Culminating in a simulated game scenario, the session provided an early look at the Crimson’s roster.
Aggressively attacking the basket, co-captain Jeremy Lin showed everyone in attendance why he was named to the All-Ivy First Team last season. A tense moment came when an airborne Lin was knocked hard to the floor, but the star guard appeared no worse for wear.
The highly-touted freshmen did not disappoint either. Local prep star Kyle Casey displayed flashes of the athleticism that brought him national recognition as a recruit, and fellow rookie Brandyn Curry showed off a nice shooting touch.
Sophomore Keith Wright was strong inside the paint, a performance aided by the absence of a couple of big men—senior Pat Magnarelli and sophomore Andrew Van Nest—who appeared to be nursing minor injuries.
When the players were done, Collins took to the floor to speak about his long and impressive basketball journey.
“I can now say I lectured at Harvard,” he joked.
After representing the United States in the 1972 Olympics, Collins was the top overall pick in the 1973 NBA draft. His career was derailed by injury, but he went on to coach eight seasons in the NBA before moving into commentary. Just last month, he received an award from the Basketball Hall of Fame for his television broadcasting work, most recently at the Summer Olympics in Beijing.
Drawing upon his vast knowledge of the game, Collins arranged players all over the court in answering audience members’ questions about defensive tactics.
The difficulty of reviving a losing basketball program was raised by one attendant during the question and answer session. Collins recognized the topic’s relevance to Harvard men’s basketball, pointing out a disparity in championship representation in the rafters of Lavietes.
“All I see up there is Harvard women [banners],” he said.
Past speakers at Amaker’s coaching clinic have included former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy in 2008, and Doc Rivers, current coach of the Celtics, in 2007.
This year’s lecturer was brought to Cambridge through a long-standing bond with Amaker.
“I’ve known Tommy since he played at Duke, and then our friendship was even more cemented. He recruited my son Chris to play at Duke,” Collins said. “I think Tommy embodies all the wonderful things I think teachers and coaches should have.”
Despite efforts by the Harvard coaching staff to attract students to the clinic, there did not appear to be more than a couple of non-coaches in the audience.
However, the event was well-received by those who did attend.
“Tommy’s a great coach. He broke everything down,” said John Viera, an assistant coach at Platt High School. “If you were a stranger to basketball, if you never even knew the game, you would come out with ten times more than you already knew.”

...but still, every fall before The Game, the Harvard College Fund Undergraduate Committee holds its "Beat Yale" shirt design contest just in case the point hasn't quite been made. The eight finalist nominees have been chosen and circulated via email, and FlyBy has chosen a few of its favorites to highlight:
1. "Harvard=Kanye, Yale=Taylor Swift"
We here at FlyBy seriously enjoyed the hilarious recent pop culture reference of this shirt. After all, the Kanye figure speaks the truth here. However, we foresee one slight problem: Didn't the MTV music awards debacle create an outpouring of support for Swift and disdain for Kanye? Yeah, that might be one unintended consequence we don't want...
2. "Purell Yale"
Of course it is to be expected that there would be a nominated shirt referencing the swine flu paranoia from this fall. But the "Purell" jab really seals FlyBy's approval of this shirt design, as it is a novel—and relevant—word to describe destruction.
3. "Safety school, safety school!"
One of the perks of being ranked number one (and just being Harvard in general)—nobody else can shout this at every other school in the U.S.
4. "FAIL!"
Short, sweet, and to the point. Large blocky letters make the message that much more clear.
Votes can be placed by replying to the email with the nominees. The deadline is Thursday, October 29, at noon. And, as goes without saying, YUCK FALE.

Months after a summer blockbuster used the campus of Penn as a stand-in for what appears to be Princeton, the makers of "The Social Network," affectionately known as "the Facebook movie," are pulling a similar campus switch. Unable to shoot on Harvard's campus, the movie's producers have decided to film three outdoor campus scenes, referring to Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg's time at Harvard, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD.
When Transformers 2 director Michael Bay snubbed Penn last summer, some on campus took up arms and started an open letter of protest on Facebook. Though in the end, Transformers 2 references neither school, and it is just assumed Shia LaBeouf attends some unnamed [stuck-up] northeastern [safety] school with an orange and black crest.
It seems there is no similar outcry from Hopkins, where students and faculty may actually be excited about the project. In a Student Announcement from Dennis O'Shea, in Communications and Public Affairs at Hopkins, the school officially welcomes the film team, citing the boost such a project can bring to a local film industry struggling amid the recession.
But no way is any audience going to believe Hopkins extras for stand-in Harvard students. Good luck trying to procure enough J.Crew loafers and North Face backpacks to make that work. Though, come to think of it, this financial boost thing seems rather practical. Maybe Harvard should've started recouping endowment losses sooner by opening its gates to film crews.
Just not NYC Prep. Dear God, anything but that.

You know the swine flu pandemic is serious when Harvard Medical  School decides to get into the game commercially.
This week, the school's Health Publications Division released an iPhone application named “The HMSMobile Swine Flu Center," now selling for $1.99.
The goal? To utilize Harvard’s extensive knowledge in order to “tell you how you can reduce your risk of contracting H1N1 anytime, anywhere through your iPhone," according to the trippy promotional trailer below:
