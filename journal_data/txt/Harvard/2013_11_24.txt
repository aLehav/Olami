After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 24, 2013, at 10:40 p.m.
Five Harvard College seniors and one Harvard graduate from the Class of 2013 were named Rhodes Scholars and will enter Oxford University in October 2014, the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.
The newly selected Harvard-affiliated winners are Elizabeth H. Byrne ’14, Alexander J. Diaz ’14, Aurora C. Griffin ’14, Andrew S. Lea ’14, Paolo P. Singer ’13-’14, and Katherine E. Warren ’13.
Harvard was the top represented school on the list of American Rhodes winners this year, followed by Yale and Stanford, who had three winners each. The selected students join a class of 32 total Americans awarded the scholarship each year through a rigorous two-stage selection process, which takes into consideration academic performance, leadership potential, philanthropic interest, and athletic accomplishments.
In interviews by phone and email on Sunday, Harvard-affiliated winners expressed gratitude for the chance to study at Oxford.
“Words can’t express how grateful I am for the Rhodes Trust for blessing me with this scholarship,” said Diaz, a psychology concentrator who will join the comparative social policy program at Oxford.
Singer, who is concentrating in economics, wrote in an email that at Oxford he plans to pursue a master’s degree in economics for development and urban geography, focusing on strategies to confront youth poverty in the United States and internationally.
“I've learned so much from my friends, professors, and mentors at Harvard the past four years. It's because of them that I have this opportunity today,” Singer wrote.
Griffin, a classics concentrator who plans to pursue a master’s degree in theology in the Christian ethics track at Oxford and ultimately work in bioethics, wrote in an email that she was astounded when she learned she had been named a Rhodes Scholar.
“I was honored and humbled because I had spent some time with the other candidates and knew that they were all amazing people,” Griffin wrote.
The winners agreed that the competition for the coveted 32 spots was fierce.
“Everyone who was competing as a finalist was top-notch,” Diaz said, adding that he thinks his “undying passion for helping those who are least well-off in society” was what made him stand out among the other applicants.
For her part, Griffin wrote that she believes she won the scholarship because she is “firmly committed to fighting the world's fight through bioethics, using principles from my faith and education in the Classics to address questions never asked before about emerging biotechnologies.”
The selection of Harvard’s newest American Rhodes Scholars brings the University’s total to 348 since the scholarship was first established in the will of Cecil Rhodes in 1902.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few understand life for faculty inside academia better than Cathy A. Trower, a researcher and writer, who is departing the Harvard Graduate School of Education Tuesday after 16 years at the forefront of research on the tenure system and the faculty experience.
Trower spent time as a university administrator and classroom instructor before beginning research on faculty. Her work as co-founder and research director of the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education at the Education School has vastly expanded knowledge of faculty satisfaction and the tenure process, colleagues said.
Trower is leaving Harvard to focus on her work with Trower & Trower, a consulting firm she co-founded with her husband, which focuses on nonprofit governance.
Trower said that she is “really excited to be focusing on board governance consulting,” and explained that she is interested “in how power is shared and distributed and how leadership unfolds in the non-profit sector.”
At the same time, Trower said it will not be easy leaving Harvard. “I have mixed emotions–it’s been great. I loved every day,” she said.
Few know Trower better than Education School professor Richard P. Chait, the co-founded of COACHE, who said Trower’s work has been very influential in higher education reserach. Their relationship stretches back to Trower’s time as a doctoral student under Chait at the University of Maryland. Their original research focused on the personal experience of pre-tenured professors.
“Cathy pioneered the effort to get these voices, and more than anyone else, analyzed the results,” Chait said. After conducting extensive surveys of junior professors, the pair discovered the importance of an institution's culture and climate to professor satisfaction. Trower has continued to research tenure systems throughout her career.
At COACHE, Trower also led the initiative’s transition from a small pilot project to a large member organization, according to the program’s current director Kiernan F. Mathews.
“Her biggest contribution overall is to remind everyone in higher education...that whereas students are the purpose for higher education, faculty are the agents for change,” Mathews said.
While Trower’s research has never focused specifically on Harvard, her experience has given her insight into the unique nature of Harvard’s tenure system.
“Because Harvard is so idiosyncratic, every school at Harvard does things differently. Even within FAS, [there are] so many different policies that it’s hard to make an overall judgement,” she said. “I would hope that we are looking more toward a model where we keep our fantastic junior faculty.”
Although Trower has been a significant part of COACHE for well over a decade, she has been steadily lessening her role with the program in recent years. “Cathy set that ball rolling so that this is not a shock to the system—it’s a natural progression and evolution,” Mathews said.
Trower said that she will miss working with “really smart people who were really dedicated,” but said she looks forward to keeping busy traveling, skiing, reading, gardening, and, of course, keeping up with her work, including a new book.

Citing its commitment to need-blind admissions and need-based financial aid, Harvard Law School will no longer collect deposits from admitted students who accept an admissions offer beginning with the Class of 2017, according to Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban ’02.
In previous years, the Law School required a $500 deposit, a standard feature of the admissions process at nearly all other law schools across the country, though precise dollar amounts may vary. This deposit is currently credited towards the student’s tuition, which totalled $52,350 for the 2013-2014 school year.
This change will apply to all future admitted classes, including members of the Harvard College Class of 2015, who will be participating in the first cycle of a pilot program in which admitted students will work for two years following college graduation before entering the Law School.
“While some applicants can absorb sending the $500 deposit, for other applicants it can pose a burden,” Soban said. “There have been several occasions when people have requested reduced deposit fees for reasons varying from being an undergrad without an income source to working in a non-profit or public interest position where $500 represents a significant amount of their monthly income.”
Although the Law School has allowed exceptions on a case-by-case basis for students who cannot afford the deposit, Soban said that admissions officers are concerned about other students who could have benefitted from not paying the fee but never asked.
Soban said that she is not concerned that the policy change will prompt students to reserve a space and later decide not to enroll.
“People entering law school are coming into a profession where reputation and commitment are highly valued,” she said. “We have found that people who tell us they are enrolling, generally do enroll. If they make a different choice later, the fact that they had put down a deposit with us does not weigh in the decision.”
Furthermore, Soban said this change will remove “an unnecessary complication” from the Law School’s admissions process.
“Over the past few years, we’ve been looking for additional ways to personalize and simplify the admissions experience for applicants—through things like our interview process—and this is just one more step in that direction,” Soban said.
Last fall, the Law School began to interview candidates through the video-conferencing software Skype, interviewing 1,200 applicants in the most recent cycle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Ichthus, a student-run journal of Christian thought, issued an official apology on Saturday for a blog post that has been taken down because of accusations of anti-Semitic language.
The post, written by an anonymous author, has garnered national attention. It read, “We, the Jews, collectively rejected God and hung Him up on a cross to die, and thus we deserved the punishments that were heaped on our heads over the last 2000 years.”
Aaron C. Gyde ’14, editor of The Harvard Ichthus, explained that the piece was not the official stance of the publication but rather the words of one particular author, which were easily misinterpreted. “The text itself suggested things that the author didn't intend,” Gyde said.
“The reason it was first published is because we are very open Christian community of intellectual thought, and we allow bloggers to write about whatever they feel like writing about,” Gyde said. “There is no review board. I had talked with the author before, and we had talked a little bit about what he wanted to write, but not too much.”
The post was first published Wednesday morning with little reaction due to the relatively small readership of the publication, according to Gyde. But by Thursday afternoon the fallout from the post was substantial enough to warrant reconsideration.
“Seeing that people were offended,” Gyde said, “we did take it upon ourselves to look very closely at the blog and we were like, ‘Oh, my goodness, this could be misinterpreted very much in ways that are against at least what we think would be proper for civil discourse.’”
In the online apology, Gyde apologized for publishing content that some found offensive and for “inadequate editorial oversight.” 
“While this does not excuse the post of responsibility, it was not the intent of the writer, nor the Ichthus, to present a piece that is anti-Semitic in nature or in interpretation,” he wrote. “The writer holds nothing but love for his heritage and feels very deeply for the welfare of the Jewish people.”
Gyde explained further the distinction between the author’s published words and intention.
“What the author intended to say was something subtly different but, I think, significantly different, which was that all people and all people groups have history of sin,” Gyde said. “[As] individuals and collectively we have fallen short of God’s standard of perfection and righteousness, and because they have fallen short of that sin they are liable, everybody, to God for judgment.” 
Harvard Hillel could not be reached for comment Sunday night. Gyde said that the group had not received official complaints from student groups and that he had not yet reached out to other organizations because of the Harvard-Yale football game.
“In response to the pain that was felt, a lot of our staff has had personal, face-to-face conversations with friends who have expressed hurt and because of that I think we are growing together even amidst this very difficult time,” he said. “We are primarily going for personal conversations instead of hosting alternative explanations on same topic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first half of Sunday evening’s nonconference matchup against Colorado (6-1), the Harvard men’s basketball team (4-1) looked every bit the mid-major power pundits had tabbed them to be. After the second 20 minutes, the evidence supporting that claim seemed a little shakier.
Whether it was fatigue brought on by the high altitude of Boulder, Colo., or simply a talented team playing up to its potential, the Buffaloes overwhelmed Harvard with a late 19-2 run to overturn a double-digit deficit, propelling them to a 70-62 win over the Crimson at the Coors Events Center.
“I thought being at home for them really gave them the energy and the shot in the arm that they needed,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It hurts for us because we thought we did some pretty darn good things, especially in the first 20 minutes. But you [have] got to play 40 minutes.”
Early on, the Crimson looked sharp in its first big test of the season, opening the game on a 16-4 run. Reversing its recent trend of poor shooting from deep, Harvard made six of its 12 three-point attempts and assisted on nine of its 16 field goals in the first half, taking a 42-30 lead into the locker room.
The Buffaloes looked sloppy by contrast, turning the ball over ten times and shooting 42.3 percent from the field.
But after leading for the previous 33 minutes of action, the Crimson’s advantage was erased by three Colorado three-pointers in just over a minute, the last of which came from wide-open junior guard and NBA Draft prospect Spencer Dinwiddie, that put the Buffaloes up, 59-52, with 3:54 to play.
“They came in the second half and fought all the way back,” sophomore guard Siyani Chambers said. “They did make adjustments, they got into us a little more, pressured us a little more, but I think defensively we just let down a little but too much. That’s what let them get on the run.”
The hot shooting form Harvard had displayed in the first half largely deserted it in the second frame, especially from beyond the arc. The Crimson shot just 1-11 from three after the break, and co-captain Laurent Rivard, Harvard’s highest-volume three-point shooter, made two of his nine total attempts from distance.
Junior guard Wesley Saunders, the team’s leading scorer, was held scoreless in the second half and finished the game with seven points, though he also drew the most challenging defensive assignments, matching up with Dinwiddie and quick junior guard Askia Booker.
“I’m very disappointed in us not being able to make some open shots,” Amaker said. “I thought we had a boatload of them in the second half, and, you give them a lot of credit, I thought they dug in and ratcheted up their defense. I thought their energy was outstanding.”
Coming off a strong game against Bryant in which he recorded 23 points and nine rebounds, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi was again a bright spot for the Crimson, pouring in 13 points on six shots from the field against a more formidable opposing front line.
Moundou-Missi’s performance notwithstanding, the Buffaloes’ size seemed to bother the Crimson, making the absence of injured 6’8” junior center Kenyatta Smith all the more keenly felt. The rest of the Crimson frontcourt, which included senior forward Kyle Casey, junior forward Jonah Travis, and freshman forward Zena Edosomwan, shot six-for-19 from the field, and the Buffaloes outrebounded Harvard 46-29. Casey, who has struggled with foul trouble this season, committed only one foul in the first half but picked up three in the second.
In examining Harvard’s regular season schedule, this was likely the second most difficult game the Crimson will play all year. Colorado received votes in both the AP and Coaches Polls this week and was playing in front of a home crowd about four times as large as the capacity of Lavietes Pavilion, which made itself known when finally given something to cheer about during the Buffaloes’ late run. And though it will still be just a tally in the loss column, Harvard showed off the talent that made it the unanimous preseason pick for the Ivy title for long stretches of Sunday’s contest.
“[It was] our first true road game,” Amaker said. “I thought we did an exceptional job managing the game. We had a lot of poise and composure in the first half, and I was disappointed that we didn’t display that as much as we needed in the second half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 20 minutes of dominant basketball, the Harvard men’s basketball team had out-dribbled, out-shot, and out-played Colorado on the Buffaloes’ own turf.
The Crimson shredded a weak perimeter defense to dominate from behind the arc, shooting 50 percent from deep. Harvard forced nine turnovers and finished the half with a convincing 12-point lead after jumping out to a 16-4 lead in the first four minutes.
But the fire had been lit.
The Buffaloes stormed back in the second half, opening on a 9-2 run to pull within five, and it became just a matter of time as the Harvard defense began a slow collapse. Colorado outshot the Crimson 13-8 in the second stanza and came away with a 70-62 victory at Coors Events Center on Sunday night.
“They just came out with a little more energy than us in the second half,” junior wing Wesley Saunders said. “Fatigue comes into play, but we’ve got to fight through that. We just have to give them credit; they won the game.”
Harvard finished the game with a season-low 29 rebounds to the Buffaloes’ 46 and shot 23 percent from the field in the second half. A three pointer from co-captain Laurent Rivard pulled the Crimson within four points with 30 seconds to play, but Colorado was perfect from the charity stripe with Harvard forced to foul to get back into the game.
“I thought we missed some and got frustrated,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we were trying to do things that ordinarily we shouldn’t be trying to do, to make up for it. Our shot selection wasn’t the best that it needed to be, given that we missed some wide-open shots.”
DIN-WINNING
After a nearly three minute scoreless stretch in the second half, Buffaloes guard Spencer Dinwiddie gave the Crimson a taste of what might have been.
The junior guard—who turned down Harvard for Colorado in the recruiting process—hit a jumper with less than six minutes on the clock to bring the Buffaloes within two and spark the decisive rally. Freshman forward Zena Edosomwan was stuffed on the other end, and two quick threes in transition set up Dinwiddie again.
His shot—the third from beyond the arc in three straight possessions for Colorado—was nothing but net. In less than a minute, Harvard had gone from up four to down seven.
“They certainly made some shots that they didn’t make in the first half,” Amaker said. “Dinwiddie’s an outstanding player. Their guards penetrated and made plays off the bounce [in the second half].”
Dinwiddie finished the night with a team-high 17 points—including 10 in the second half—on 4-7 shooting from deep.
CROWDED OUT
As Colorado rallied in the second half, so did a raucous home crowd.
Playing on the road for the first time this season, the Crimson faced its first true test. Harvard opened its season with four decisive victories at home. But in the first of six consecutive road games—including three at the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout next week—Harvard faltered.
Harvard’s energy level fell in the second half as Colorado adapted and began to penetrate its defense. A win in the Buffaloes home arena would have been a statement for the Crimson, whose national attention suffers due to a perennially weak schedule playing in the Ivy League. With only two more true non-conference tests—Vermont and Connecticut—Harvard missed an opportunity to make its presence felt on the national stage.
Though a lack of fan support did not prevent the Crimson from jumping out to an early lead, Harvard could not find its offensive rhythm in the second half, and fell at the hands of a newly cohesive Buffaloes offense. Colorado and its fan base both found their second wind down the stretch, and the reenergized Buffaloes proved unstoppable.
“That was a big turning point, when the crowd got back into the game,” Saunders said. “In the first half, we were kind of able to stop their run, but we got some work to do.”

For some people, it’s reached that point in the semester where you’re sick of d-hall food, but it’s also too close to Thanksgiving Break to ask your parents to send you a care package filled with junk food that you trick yourself into believing can replace meals. If you’re looking for any semblance of a justification for spending money on food in the Square, here are some rewards programs at stores that may make you feel better with every purchase.
 
StarbucksIf you register a Starbucks gift card online and store money in it to make purchases, you can begin to earn what are called “stars.” Accruing stars leads to rewards such as in-store refills on coffee and tea or (my personal favorite) the free drink or food reward. You get a free drink on your birthday just for registering your card, and if you reach 30 stars within 12 months, you receive a special golden Starbucks card with your name on it (so you can feel like the ultimate VIP customer).
 
QdobaQdoba’s rewards program runs on “points,” where various items on the menu have different point values. You get a free entree every 1,000 points (which is about every 10 entrees), and you get to choose between a free soda or chips and salsa just for registering your Qdoba rewards card online (hint: soda is always readily available for free in the d-halls).
PaneraPanera’s rewards program is a bit different because there is no accumulation of points—instead, you’re “surprised” with rewards. Based on your purchases, Panera keeps track of what you like and personalizes your coupons or rewards accordingly. You get a free bakery item when you register your card online for the first time, which is the perfect accompaniment for a study session at Panera (or if you’re like me, pretending you’re engaged in deep thought about your paper while you’re actually people-watching on Mass. Ave.).
 
PinkberryThe rewards program at Pinkberry is simple—you get a free small-sized yogurt with toppings after every 10th purchase and also on your birthday. Yes, froyo exists beyond the d-halls’ Chocoluck, and there are toppings other than Colossal Crunch.

It’s time to embrace the holiday season, and what a better way to celebrate than to decorate your room? By now, everyone’s ready to revamp their dorm anyways. We at Flyby officially declare it time to “festivize” your living space.
 
Here are seven suggestions for holiday room decorating:

 
1. Get a Christmas treeAlthough a fake tree might seem easier to maintain, the natural pine scent that can only come from a real tree makes the daily watering worth it. Plus, Christmas tree decorating is the best, and a fun winter activity to do with roommates.  And if you “don’t have space for a tree,” consider this option.
 2. DIY ornaments and craftsA great project when it’s cold and dark outside and you’ll add to the holiday cheer in your room. Check out Pinterest for approximately one billion ideas.
 
3. Hang up some stockingsEven though Santa probably won’t be stopping by your dorm, stockings always look great—hang them over your fireplace if you have one or over your desk. Another suggestion: do a Secret Santa with roommates or friends and stick gifts for one another in the stockings.
 
4. Fake snowSprinkle fake snow all over your floor, it’s probably already dirty anyways.
 
5. Advent calendarAn advent calendar adds cheer to a room, plus countdowns are always enjoyable and depending on what kind you get, you can enjoy chocolate everyday. Here are some advent calendar ideas.
 
6. Snowflake stickers and cut outsWhile there may be actual snow falling outside, snowflake window stickers and cut outs are an easy, space-minimizing way to add holiday cheer to a room.
 
7. NutcrackerHaving a nutcracker in your room is not only seasonal, but practical.

Earlier this week, Harvard Student Agencies sent out a survey asking for students’ top three Harvard bucket list items, promising one lucky entrant $250 as a prize. With Black Friday right around the corner, that extra pocket change wouldn’t hurt. And since having sex in the stacks, peeing on the John Harvard statue, and doing Primal Scream are too cliché, we’ve come up with three alternative Harvard bucket list items. If you can cross these off your list, you’re the ultimate Harvard student. Or crazy person.
1. Skinny dip in the Charles during reading period
Skinny dipping in the Charles during the warm summer months is one thing. Skinny dipping in the dead of winter is a whole different animal. One-up Primal Scream—sure, there’s a chance you’ll get hypothermia, but just imagine the hilarious facial expressions of the rowers in the boathouse. In fact, if you publicize the event beforehand, you might be a bigger deal than the Head of the Charles. 
2. Throw a rager in the Mass Hall dorms
Invite everyone in the College, even your proctor. Hire a professional DJ, get the beverages flowing, and turn Harvard into a "real" school for a night. Then ask University President Drew G. Faust to make a celebrity appearance, since her office is conveniently located right beneath the dorms. If you could pull off playing beer pong with Harvard’s president, it’d be massively epic.
 3. Streak at Harvard-Yale
It’s a little late to check off our last bucket list item this year, but with national coverage and thousands of viewers, streaking at Harvard-Yale would be the supreme declaration of school pride. Since we’ll always undoubtedly crush Yale anyways, interrupting the Game won’t be too big of a deal. Like those Harvard spirit t-shirts, let’s show those bulldogs who’s really #wellendowed.
