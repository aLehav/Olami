After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Togetherness” should be a great show. After an eight-episode first season, the self-indulgent yet down-to-earth comedy-drama has returned to HBO. It is produced, written and directed by the Duplass Brothers; Mark, the more famous of the two, has acted in eclectic roles ranging from farcical fantasy football comedy “The League” to mediocre supernatural horror film “The Lazarus Effect." Here Mark Duplass plays Brett Pierson, a newly rededicated husband and father of two. His wife, Michelle—played by Melanie Lynskey—has recently slept with another man. The cast is filled out by Tina, Michelle’s sister, whose countenance embodies her emotional dishevelment, and Mark’s best friend, Alex, a sad sack turned moderately successful actor.
Plot and setting are simultaneously disregarded in and integral to the artistic message of the Duplass brothers. The characters visit Alex, who has temporarily moved to New Orleans to act in a small vampire movie, for his birthday. They have dinner. They go to a club. Half the runtime is dedicated to the purchase of a gift that will likely never be seen again. The pinnacle of an exotic activity is late night karaoke. Even the city of New Orleans—so often portrayed in media as loud and boisterous—feels soulless through the lens of Brett and Michelle’s experiences. There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach. The Duplass Brothers have sought to create a show that reflects, within reason, ordinary experiences that most married couples have been through. At the ordinary, they have succeeded. Precisely because of this mundanity, the Duplass Brothers are able to examine the nature of everyday relationships.
Duplass and Lynskey do their best to inhabit this vision. Mark Duplass especially channels his eclectic filmography, equal parts horrifying and amusing as a husband frenetically attempting to convince his wife of his commitment to their marriage. Even Amanda Peet and Steve Zissis, Tina and Alex respectively, have a chemistry that lends emotional potency to simple scenes.
The problem of characterization in “Togetherness” does not lie in the actors’ portrayal of the characters but in the limited emotional material these talented actors are given. Every character is unpleasantly normal. It is as if the Duplass brothers created the same character four times, slapped on one or two traits they found amusing, and gave each a few identifiable emotions. Each feels like a character in a short story. After 30 minutes, the viewer knows the whole of the humanity with which the Duplass brothers have attempted to imbibe these characters. The show feels like the unpleasant marriage it attempts to portray: dull, repetitive and unfailingly unsurprising.
In the closing moments of the season premiere, Brett, with characteristic sad enthusiasm, proposes marriage to his wife again. In one of the finest moments for the writers and Lynskey, the viewer is privy to her intellectual understanding of the graciousness of the gesture and her simultaneous and instinctive understanding of the emotional bankruptcy of the proposal. The series begins to play out in the same way—a sequence of empty motions that mean to convey emotion, yet fail because like Michelle, we know too much of the simple characters to love them. “Togetherness” should be a great show and scenes like this deliver the promise of a good show. It simply fails at being an interesting one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, senior Patrick Steeves wrote his own fairy tale.
On the eve of Senior Night, the forward had a career-high 25 points on 13 baskets, none more important than the two free throws he sunk with seven seconds left that provided the decisive margin in a 73-71 win over Princeton (20-6, 10-2 Ivy). On the Tigers’ last chance to tie, Steeves—who played a total of zero minutes his first three years due to multiple knee and foot surgeries—rejected a Myles Stephens layup before Princeton’s last gasp attempt rolled off the rim.
His ensuing scream of joy could be heard from the rafters.
“I don’t know how to put [the feeling] into words, to be honest,” Steeves said.
The entire game was perfectly tailored to Steeves’ skill set. With Princeton’s only two centers—junior Pete Miller and sophomore Alec Brennan—in constant foul trouble, Tigers coach Mitch Henderson went to uber-small lineups with either the 6’5” Steven Cook or the 6’4” Spencer Weisz playing the five.
Initially, Harvard (12-16, 5-8) feasted. Seniors Evan Cummins and Agunwa Okolie had 16 of Harvard’s first 23 points by repeatedly driving the lane. As Princeton kept getting smaller, Harvard kept extending its lead—Harvard’s 26 first-half points in the paint enabled it to build an eight-point lead at the break.
At the center of the action was Steeves, the versatile wing who leads the team in three-point percentage and ranks second in assists. After Princeton made an 11-0 second-half run to take its first lead, Steeves came back with a three-point play to put Harvard back in front.
After two free throws from Steven Cook tied up the game, the senior was back at it. He had baskets on Harvard’s next three possessions to push the lead to five, backing down smaller Princeton defenders and scoring at will in the paint until Henderson moved Cook, Princeton’s best defender, onto him.
With a bigger defender on him, Steeves showed his range. After Princeton pulled to within two on a Cook three-point play, Steeves had two threes in 95 seconds to push the lead back to four.
“If I’m playing the four and there’s a big guy on me, I take him outside,” Steeves said. “If he’s too small, I’ll take him inside.”
The Tigers kept coming. Twice already this Ivy League season, Princeton had come back from late deficits to force overtime on the road—eventually taking both contests (at Penn and Columbia) in the extra session. With fouls slowing the game’s pace to a crawl, Princeton continued cutting the gap. The Tigers repeatedly took advantage of sloppy Crimson turnovers and a couple fortuitous bounces, including a Cook airball that went right to Stephens with just under two and a half minutes to play. Stephens’ ensuing dunk just beat the shot clock and cut the lead to one.
A possession later, Cook—who made just two of his seven threes—was on target with a triple to give Princeton just its second lead of the night, 69-68, with 95 seconds to go.
“They’re so hard to guard because of how they spread you,” Amaker said. “They have really good shooters and you can’t help off.”
On the ensuing possession, Princeton held Harvard to a near shot-clock violation before Corbin Miller recovered his errant shot, the 11th Harvard offensive rebound of the game. Scarcely 20 seconds later, the Crimson offense found the mismatch it wanted: the 6’1” Devin Cannady fronting 6’9” junior Zena Edosomwan. Senior Agunwa Okolie found Edosomwan on a lob pass and junior knocked down a layup as Cannady tried to wrap him up. The ensuing free throw pushed the lead to two and brought the crowd to its feet.
The Tigers barely panicked, with Cannady driving the length of the floor for an easy layup to tie the game at 71. With under two seconds separating the game clock, Harvard held the ball for the last shot.
Steeves looked over to Amaker for the play and saw an unusual call: four-deep, an isolation play the coach only ran for former Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders.
“Coach said at the end of the game that he hadn’t called that for anyone else in a while except Wesley,” Steeves said. “At the beginning of the game, I wasn’t having a great game … He just trusted me, left me in the game, and let me take the last shot.”
The rest was history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team picked up this season’s signature win with a 73-71 victory over Princeton on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The win was the Crimson’s first against one of the Ivy League’s three top teams this season and made the Tigers’ quest for an NCAA Tournament bid all the more difficult. If Yale can defeat Columbia Saturday night in New York, the Bulldogs will punch their first ticket to the Big Dance since 1962.
Harvard (12-16, 5-8 Ivy League) will have a chance to claim sole possession of fourth place in the Ancient Eight with a win over Penn on Saturday while Princeton (20-6, 10-2) will need some help from the Lions in order to leave New England with an opportunity to seize a share of the title with a win next Wednesday against the Quakers.
FOUR YEARS IN THE MAKING
Senior forward Patrick Steeves was the difference on Friday for the Crimson. Harvard’s sixth man, who did not play a minute in his first three seasons in Cambridge, had his moment in the sun during his penultimate collegiate contest. With the game tied at 71 with 31.7 seconds to go, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker elected to ride the hot hand and called an isolation play for the Montreal native.
Steeves was fouled, nailed the two ensuing free throws, and blocked freshman Myles Stephens’ shot attempt on the other end to secure the victory. The final two possessions were a fitting conclusion to an evening in which Steeves, who scored a game-high 25 points, was consistently the best offensive player on the floor.
“I never would have thought that one year, two years ago, I would be in this position,” Steeves said. “I think it’s more of [Coach] trusting me to make that play than actually making the play.”
After only five points in the game’s first 19:56, the senior drilled a deep three to send the Crimson into halftime with an eight-point edge. As the Tigers clawed back, Steeves was the only Harvard player holding Princeton from a dance with destiny in Hanover.
The Crimson’s most versatile offensive player was tasked with guarding Princeton’s small-ball frontcourt and answered the call on the other end by scoring 15 of Harvard’s first 23 points to start the second half. Of the team’s 10 second half field goals, Steeves was responsible for six. None were as important as the two makes from the charity stripe with the game on the line.
“What an effort,” Amaker said. “I said to our kids, I thought we deserved it, whether or not it would happen for us.”
Against Columbia in January, Steeves and junior guard Corbin Miller missed the front ends of one-and-ones to leave the door open for what would eventually become a one-point Lion victory. On Friday, Steeves made up for it and then some.
If it can take care of its business on Saturday, Yale can thank the Crimson and its unlikely hero for helping to end its 54-year NCAA Tournament drought.
“I have a couple buddies on Yale though so I’m going to make sure to reach out to them,” Steeves said. “They have to take care of their business too. It’s kind of fitting. Dartmouth gave us a chance last year, this year we have to put the scales back in balance I guess.”
HOT START
Whether it was tired legs or shot nerves, the Tigers did not look like the team that outscored Harvard by 16 points in the teams’ first meeting last month. The Crimson, on the other hand, won the opening tip and did not look back, never trailing in the game’s first 20 minutes. The lead peaked at eight with 3:20 to play before the break and once again when Steeves drained a deep three before the halftime buzzer.
“We wanted to play inside-out and that’s what we always try to do, that’s our philosophy and I thought we were really determined to get the ball in the paint, get the ball to the rim and I thought we were good on the offensive glass as well,” Amaker said.
The hosts exploited Princeton’s undersized front line. Both starting junior Pete Miller and backup sophomore Alec Brennan struggled with foul trouble, notching six in just 25 minutes of play. Harvard was patient in its halfcourt offense, which led to open jumpers and quality looks inside. The Crimson finished the frame with 26 points in the paint while making 57.6 percent of its shots. The team only attempted two three pointers but managed to put up 43 points, the most it has scored in a first half this season.

Good news for your stomachs and bad news for your wallets, everyone. Restaurant Week (or so we’re told it’s now called Dine Out Boston) is back from March 6-11 and then from March 13-18, for those of you staying in town for spring break. Yes, that’s right– it’s the return of that special time of year when you pretend to live a luxurious life because you can (sort of) afford a multi-course meal. Based on the restaurant’s discretion, lunches are $15, $20, or $25 and dinners are $28, $33, or $38. To save you some precious time during midterm season (or maybe you want to engage in self-sabotaging behavior and are looking for any and all means of procrastination), Flyby has put together some highlights from the list of participating restaurants.
For those looking to up their food Instagram gameThe Met Back Bay (L: $20, D: $33)For everyone who loves Instagram and food Instagram accounts (I mean, what else do you do when it’s 2 a.m., you want to procrastinate but are also hungry, and Brain Break only offers Raisin Bran aka yuck) as much as I do, you’ve probably seen so many ‘grams of brunches from this place. Take a nice aerial picture of your food, pick the right #filters, location tag it, and maybe you’ll become Instagram famous. Probably not, but at least you had a nice meal.
For those going on a date (lucky you)Bacco (D: $33)Bacco’s own website boasts that critics have called it “one of the most romantic restaurants in Boston,” so we’ll take it. But actually, this place is two floors and has tall windows that give a nice view out onto the street– combine that with pasta and dim lighting and that sounds like romance to us.
Haru (L: $25, D: $38)Sushi is always a date-friendly food, right? Plus, the Dine Out Boston menu boasts fish tacos and mochi ice cream so that’s an A+ in our book.
For those who are too lazy to take the TBeat Brasserie (L: $25, D: $38)You probably see signs to this restaurant as you walk past The Gap. The food is American and International cuisine, there’s live music playing many nights, and they even boast a wine tap system. Sounds trendy enough to us.
Harvest (L: $25, D: $33)Not just for when your parents are in town! It boasts New England cuisine, plus it’s really cute that it’s basically hidden between Anthropologie and Ann Taylor.
P.S. Apparently, they’re having an Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter contest where you could win a $100 gift certificate to one of the participating restaurants in the upcoming winter Dine Out Boston if you #DineOutBoston and get the most likes.

In light of the ongoing chaos enveloping a campus slowly ravaged by mumps, the optimistic young Flyby survivors of the latest great epidemic are pleased to bring some good news to these disease-ridden lands. There is, indeed, a light at the end of the tunnel of your battle to remain healthy or not spread the disease to too many people at the party you’re planning to attend this weekend. The saving grace: free ice cream.
In exchange for a 20-minute survey concerning health and mental health on campus, Harvard University Health Services is offering $5 J.P. Licks gift cards. Think about this opportunity, people. When the mumps set in and your jaw starts aching and you develop an unbearable earache, you can now take comfort in the fact that someday, when you’re able to swallow again, you’ll be able to enjoy ice cream paid for by the one and only HUHS (that is, unless you’re one of the tens of students who probably fill out the survey yet never claim his/her prize).
Pickup is a little tricky - you have to leave your dorm room and travel one floor up on UHS, and then talk with a real human being in order to retrieve the card. Sorry CS50 alums, this one requires human contact. But it’s well worth the free ice cream! And anyway, the survey doesn’t require any open-ended responses. So just be prepared to admit that you’re a virgin with a drinking problem and you’re well on your way to claiming your free ice cream. What are you waiting for, Harvard? Throw your trust back into HUHS after failing the student body on mumps, and just hope the free ice cream doesn’t come with free food poisoning.

As if clicking ‘Like’ on Facebook weren’t expressive enough, now there are six different ways you’re allowed to feel about someone’s new profile picture or Go Fund Me post. Now all six human emotions are displayed when you hover over the ‘Like’ button. Instead of just liking you-know-who’s 100th post of the day, you can show them that Facebook activism really does make a difference by letting them know that you too are “sad” or “angry” at the state of the world. Go crazy.
Seriously, Zuck? Did we need this? All we ever asked you for was a dislike button, so we could effortlessly express that we’re sorry to hear about something bad happening (or sorry we had to see someone’s crazy ‘I support Trump’ post), and instead you gave us this. And come on. “Haha” isn’t even an emotion. “Wow my status for a truth is” just does not make sense.
But it gets worse. How are we supposed to quantify our Facebook presences? Before, it was just about how many likes your ‘comp my club’ profile picture got, but how do we judge its reception now? Are “haha”s positive or negative? Are we supposed to subtract the negative reactions from the positive to figure out the public’s net opinion? Do we need equations and actual math skills to know if our crush thinks we look good in our latest post? This is too much.
