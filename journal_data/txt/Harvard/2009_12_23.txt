After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team led by Harvard researchers  has discovered a family of naturally occurring proteins in human cells  that protect against influenza and other illnesses—a finding that  may lead to methods to speed up vaccine production and to new flu prevention  drugs for humans.
Shedding greater light on the  human body’s first-line defense against the flu virus, the researchers  found that the family of flu-fighting proteins—called the interferon-inducible  transmembrane (IFITM) proteins—prevented or slowed down most virus  particles from infecting human cells early in the lifecycle of the virus.  The team reported its findings in an online journal on Thursday.
“Most of the time we find  things that the virus needs,” said Abraham L. Brass, instructor in  medicine at Harvard Medical School and Mass. General Hospital, who helped  lead the study. “This time we found something our cells are using  to resist the virus.”
The influenza virus—equipped  with only eight genes of its own—hijacks the genetic material of its  host cell, infecting and utilizing the human genes to execute the virus’  own operations, according to Stephen J. Elledge, a professor of genetics  at Harvard Medical School and head of the lab in which the study took  place. With this understanding, Elledge and his team systematically  deactivated every gene in the human genome—testing some 20,000 different  genes—using new RNA interference technology, hoping to determine the  genes in the host cells that the virus relied upon for infection.
“We were trying to sabotage  them by figuring out what they’re actually using and taking it away,”  said Elledge, who is also a senior geneticist at Brigham and Women’s  Hospital.
The researchers, who had already  used this same process in studies of HIV and the hepatitis C virus,  hoped to find that some of the treated cells could not be infected with  the influenza virus, which would suggest that the virus needed the deactivated  gene to function. Instead, the researchers were surprised to find that  the rate of infection increased dramatically when certain genes were  deactivated.
The study found that the family  of proteins generated by these key genes, known as IFITM, plays a major  role in protecting cells against the flu.
“There’s a certain level  of it in your cells all the time preventing 80 to 90 percent of all  infections,” Elledge said. “If you get rid of those genes, you see nine or 10 times more infections.”
Brass and Elledge said that  they next seek to determine how IFITM works in preventing the flu. For now,  the discovery of these native anti-viral proteins may bode well for  the battle against influenza.
A drug that increases the presence  of IFITM proteins in humans without provoking negative side effects  may be an effective means of preventing influenza. Another area of potential  research is the possibility of inserting the IFITM genes into the genomes  of animals like swine and poultry—the strains of influenza most dangerous  to humans typically emerge from these animals.
In addition, the discovery  may help expedite the production of flu vaccines, according to Elledge.  By deactivating the IFITM genes in laboratory cells, scientists could  grow influenza vaccines in these cells much more quickly. The larger  crop of viruses can then be used to produce more vaccines.
Further research revealed that  the same proteins also help cells resist illnesses such as West Nile  virus, dengue fever, and yellow fever. But the proteins did not  seem to be effective in defending cells from HIV or hepatitis C.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
En route to the nation’s capital to watch the Harvard men’s basketball team try its hand at upsetting No. 13 Georgetown, former Crimson Sports Chair Loren Amor and I made a pit stop in New York City to watch another Ivy team take a shot at a Big East opponent.
In what Harvard hopes is a foreshadowing of things to come in tomorrow’s matinee against the Hoyas at the Verizon Center., Cornell defeated St. John’s last night, 71-66, to win the Madison Square Garden Holiday Festival.
Just as my path to Washington has taken me through the Concrete Jungle, Harvard’s road to an Ivy League championship must certainly go through Cornell.
And judging from last night’s contest, the journey won’t be an easy one.
Entering the 2009-’10 season, media outlets across the country unanimously agreed that the Big Red would handily walk away with its third-straight Ancient Eight championship while the rest of the league battled for second place.
That all changed two weeks ago, when Harvard played UConn tough on the road, losing by six, and then defeated Boston College for the second-straight time. Suddenly the Crimson—which was initially projected to finish fourth in the league—became a trendy pick to sneak up on Cornell and win its first-ever Ivy League title.
But the Big Red has jumped out to a solid start as well this season, with road wins over Alabama and Massachusetts. Last night Cornell added to its list of impressive victories with its defeat of St. John’s.
In a sparsely filled Madison Square Garden, the Big Red made a strong case for why it still deserves to be recognized as the team to beat in the Ivy League.
Cornell’s most impressive attribute on display was its poise. The Big Red trailed by double digits for much of the first half, but managed to claw its way back into the game, despite lacking its opponent’s athleticism. Down by five at the start of the second half, Cornell came out firing and took a 49-47 lead midway through the frame off a post move from seven-foot center Jeff Foote.
The Big Red’s comeback was a product of its consistent and disciplined play—rather than desperately chucking up bad shots to cut down the deficit, Cornell continued to look for the open man. When St. John’s started to fire low-percentage shots, the Big Red took advantage.
Cornell’s focused, even-keeled approach is not surprising, given the squad’s experienced roster, led by the senior trio of Foote, Ryan Wittman, and Louis Dale.
But Cornell’s success is not bred from poise alone. Against St. John’s, the Big Red also lived up to its billing as a team that can shoot the lights out. Cornell shot an absurd 61.1 percent from deep, with four different players netting at least two treys. This hot-handed effort spells trouble for opponents, since the Big Red goes out of its way to find looks from beyond the arc. Twice early on last night, Cornell ran a play where Foote faked a screen and then cut to the basket as he received the pass. Instead of taking it to the hole, Foote redirected the ball out to the perimeter where his teammates stood open as their defenders collapsed on the big man.
This ability to dominate in many respects of the game will be crucial in Ivy League play, where the lack of a postseason tournament makes each league contest critical. For its part, Harvard proved last season that it could play with anybody, defeating Boston College and Cornell, but its inability to match the Big Red's steadiness led to disappointing losses against lesser opponents like Dartmouth and Brown.
This season, the younger and healthier Crimson has looked more dependable, with its only slip-up coming against Army. But Harvard must be wary of other Ivy opponents such as Princeton and Columbia, which could end the Crimson’s title hopes early on.
Yet, while Harvard still has to prove it can play at a high level for the entire season, even the favored Big Red is far from flawless.
Last night, Cornell’s lack of depth was exposed. The Big Red went to its reserves early on, but the bench contributed just six points in 50 minutes of play and was outscored by St. John’s backups, 25-6. Meanwhile, Harvard’s bench has outscored its opponent’s reserves in each of the Crimson’s nine matchups.
Cornell also struggled to attack the basket, scoring nearly all of its points off three pointers and post moves from Foote. While Foote’s tall frame makes it difficult to stop him under the basket, the Big Red cannot expect to shoot over 60 percent from long distance every night, and will eventually be forced to rely on some penetration from its backcourt.
The Crimson, on the other hand, has scored at least 38 points in the paint in each of its last three contests, relying on its ability to get to the rim and find high-percentage looks.
But while Harvard appears to hold certain advantages over Cornell on paper, the Big Red still reigns as the Ivy League’s top dog. The Crimson will have a chance to change that perception on Jan. 30, when the two squads square off in Ithaca. But for now, we’ll see if Harvard can live up to the precedent set by the Ancient Eight’s defending champion by defeating its own talented Big East opponent tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Winter Olympics open on Feb. 12, two Harvard alumnae will get the chance to defend their gold medal on home ice.
Jennifer Botterill ’01-’03 and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 are among the 21 skaters named to the Canadian Olympic women’s hockey roster, which was released Monday.
Botterill, a forward, has played in every Games since women’s hockey became an Olympic sport in 1998. Vaillancourt, also a forward, skated in the 2006 Torino Games.
Botterill and Vaillancourt were both recipients of the Patty Kazmaier Award—given to the best player in collegiate women’s hockey—during their Crimson careers.
Canada, the two-time defending Olympic champion, opens group play Feb. 13 against Slovakia. Though the Canadian team has lost the last two World Championships to the United States, the squad will enjoy home-ice advantage in Vancouver.
Botterill and Vaillancourt join former teammates Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07 and Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 as 2010 Olympians. Ruggiero, Chu and Cahow were named to the US team last week.

Doing good is going to get a whole lot easier for the Phillips Brooks House Association. The omnipresent Harvard non-profit got a mid-finals period pick-me-up when it won $25,000 in the Chase Community Giving competition for being voted into the top 100 charities in the United States.
With JPMorgan Chase & Co. providing the money and Facebook providing the voting platform (Facebook users logged on to vote and were encouraged to become "fans" of their favorite charities), 100 organizations—including our very own PBHA—emerged as the cream of the crop among small, local charities. Emily M. Parrott '09, a PBHA nonprofit management fellow, told us that PBHA is the only charity out of the top 100 to serve the Cambridge and greater Boston areas. Starting Jan. 15, the association will be competing in another round of voting for the grand prize: a cool $1 million. What's PBHA doing with its newly won money?
"SUP," Parrott said.
PBHA plans to use the funds to match donations made to its Summer Urban Program, which is comprised of 12 camps run by Harvard undergraduates for low-income youth in the community. When voting for charities opened to 350 million Facebook users in early November, the first person to cast a vote for PBHA out of 500,000 other local charities was local high school student Philip Chu, who has attended SUP camps since the age of six and has recently served as a junior counselor for SUP's Chinatown Adventure program.
PBHA president Richard S. Kelley '10 said that he was "thrilled" by PBHA's win and happy that more kids in the area will get the funding they need to attend camp. According to Parrott, just $1,500 would cover expenses for one camper's entire summer at SUP.
"That's what many other camps would cost for just a week," she said.
Now that PBHA is entering a final round of voting to vie against charities such as the American Cancer Society and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, Parrott emphasized that the association needs "everyone at Harvard to vote."
Other top 100 competitors include nonprofit networking Web site Idealist.org, the Yalie-founded college advising group ReadySetLaunch, and Big Cats Rescue, the world's largest sanctuary for tigers and such. Our favorite top 100 charity, besides PBHA? The Feel Your Boobies Foundation.
