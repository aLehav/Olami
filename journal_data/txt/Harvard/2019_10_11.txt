After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jodi Kantor can still remember the moment Harvey Weinstein arrived at the offices of the New York Times.
It was the day before the exposé on Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct — the beginning of the reporting that would go on to inaugurate the #MeToo movement and win the Pulitzer Prize for public service — was slated to publish in the Times. Kantor and her reporting partner Megan Twohey were finalizing the story when they got word of Weinstein’s imminent arrival.
“Megan and I are frantically doing the 10,000 things we need to do before publication,” Kantor recounted. “Megan and I are on the fourth floor of the Times. And Megan gets the message saying, ‘Harvey’s on his way to the office now. He wants to talk off-the-record and he has really important stuff you need to see before you’re going to publish.’”
In the moment, Kantor was in disbelief.
“She sends this to me and I’m like, ‘Harvey’s on his way here?’” she said. “We had already had this well-organized series of phone calls with teams of lawyers and whatnot, and I was like, ‘We’re not going to meet with him.’”
But Twohey insisted on taking the meeting, Kantor recalled, during which Weinstein presented a folder of evidence against Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd in an effort to kill the story.
“My partner was like, ‘I’m taking that meeting,’” she said. Then, smiling, she added, “Megan relished the chance to face off against him.”
The crowd at First Parish Church applauded enthusiastically — the first of many moments like it, over the course of the event. Joined in conversation by actress and political activist Ashley Judd and moderated by NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson, Kantor and Twohey discussed their recently released joint memoir, “She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Case that Helped Ignite a Movement.”
Both Kantor and Twohey stressed the importance of rigorous journalistic ethics, particularly while reporting a story this sensitive.
“Journalistically, you were doing something very sound,” Kantor said to Twohey, about her willingness to give Weinstein an audience on that hectic day. “Because you were saying, ‘I want to see everything. If there’s anything he’s going to try to rebut this story, we want to see it before publication, and not after.”
The book, Twohey continued, walks readers through each step of the journalistic process.
“You can see the painstaking work we do when it comes to corroboration, when it comes to the other types of due diligence, when it comes to fairness,” she said. “At the very end, we were able to walk readers through what it was like when we finally had to go to Harvey Weinstein with all of our findings, and give him an opportunity to respond.”
Yet despite harrowing moments like these, the journalists were motivated by the potential to effect change on a large scale.
“We go through all of that work, even when it involves Harvey Weinstein barging into the New York Times in the eleventh hour to try to stop us,” Twohey said. “Because we really feel like, as reporters, we have confidence in that process and feel like if you’re able to adhere to it and publish the truth, it can actually bring about change.”
Kantor and Twohey were not the only ones facing adversity, though — for Judd, the decision to come forward as one of the first named sources in the story required thoughtful consideration. It began when, while on vacation from filming, Judd received a message from Nicholas Kristof, the New York Times journalist.
“He said, ‘You know, I have a journalist friend who would like to talk to you,’” Judd said. “And I thought, ‘This is about Harvey. Somebody’s finally going to write this story.’”
After Kantor reached out to Judd, the actress began contributing sources and possible leads. It wasn’t long before Kantor asked her to be quoted on the record.
“I ran through all possible worst-case scenarios,” Judd said. “Harvey sues me for defamation and slander, I lose my career — little did I know that I had very much already lost the majority of my career because of his defamation and slander against me.”
But then Kantor raised an important counterargument, one that ultimately counteracted Judd’s reluctance.
“Jodi did something really wise,” Judd said. “She said, ‘What’s the best case scenario? How could this play out optimally?’”
All things considered, it did play out optimally. The publication of the story sparked a wave of sweeping sexual misconduct allegations in the fall of 2017, eventually leading to the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements for gender equality and women’s rights.
Still, the journalists admitted, there is much progress to be desired, particularly in governmental institutions.
“The government really has ineffective ways of speaking out to these individuals and curbing this behavior,” Kantor said, citing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as an insufficient resource for addressing workplace discrimination. “That mandate that’s now, I think, over 50 years old reflects a totally different reality in which so much more is brushed under the rug.”
Despite this lack of institutional response, there were still moments of peace to be found amidst the upheaval that followed — namely, an afternoon spent in Gwyneth Paltrow’s living room in Brentwood, Los Angeles. In attendance were Kantor, Twohey, and Judd, as well as Christine Blasey-Ford, the psychologist who testified against now-Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
“It was beautiful,” Judd remembered. “I was the one in my pajamas. I flew from Germany to be there. It was very special to be there, with that circle of women.”
Surrounded by others with similarly painful experiences, the women who convened in Paltrow’s home felt finally at peace, according to Judd.
“The world’s good at talking, but we all need to be listened to,” she said. “There was a little bit of healing for each of us, during those two days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Does Stephen Chbosky know what he ended up writing, that is, did he read the final product? Did an editor read the final product? It’s difficult to say, because “Imaginary Friend,” his first novel since “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” is not a horror novel — even though that’s how it’s being marketed. It certainly asks difficult questions, but having horror elements does not necessarily make it a novel of that genre. It’s the “squares are rectangles, but rectangles aren’t squares” argument, but applied to books. It’s a shame that the novel was put in this category, because Chbosky might have been able to further develop his underlying religious themes had there been fewer distracting elements in the way.
To start with the good parts: Chbosky knows how to spin a good story. Christopher, the seven year-old protagonist, and his mother, Kate Reese, move to Mill Grove, Penn, to escape her abusive boyfriend. Christopher ends up in the woods, starts hearing voices, becomes a genius overnight, and figures out that the imaginary world which he can see in his dreams is actually Hell. One character becomes pregnant despite not having ever had sex, while another woman attempts to drown herself in a gallon of paint. Both occurrences, in the larger context of the story, are deeply unsettling — in a good way.
As a screenwriter firmly rooted in the TV and movie industries, Chbosky has also been clearly taking notes from his peers: Christopher spends a good chunk of the novel with a nosebleed à la “Stranger Things” from the exertion needed to save the world. “Carcasses of trees” was an excellent image about a quarter of the way into the book, and the idea of God as a murderer was one well worth exploring.
All these positive elements do not nearly disguise, however, the larger problems of the novel, the most significant of which is its incorrect categorization. There are certainly enough gory moments and jump scares — though the effect of the latter on the page is limited at best — to qualify it as a horror novel, but Chbosky unfortunately falls flat. Amazon.com calls it “literary horror,” which, in addition to being meaningless, seems like an attempt to dress up the genre simply because the author happens to be a respected screenwriter and wrote one of the — if not “the” — books about being a teenager in America.
Part of the reason that “Imaginary Friend” can’t quite be considered horror is because of its pacing — which is directly tied to the novel’s length. Yes, it’s true that other successful additions to the genre are upwards of a thousand pages, but the way their plots develop is markedly different. “Imaginary Friend” may have a climax, but there are so many little ones that the reader is left wondering if “that was it.” The result is a novel that moves slowly all the way through, rather than accelerating at precise moments. The hospital scenes, the escape scenes, and the car chase scenes blend into one another so seamlessly that their purpose is lost and the reader’s attention is gone. Horror novels should not be boring, but this one was.
Chbosky tried on a lot of hats while writing this book. There are moments in the novel when Christopher, the seven-year-old who becomes almost omnipotent, thinks about God’s love and the difference between making decisions out of fear and out of love — all very cosmic stuff, and one can easily see the influences of “Perks of Being a Wallflower.” Sometimes Chbosky’s own voice comes through in moments when the narrator says quips like “the touché part was silent.” And there are larger moments of cultural commentary, like when Mary Katherine — our resident Virgin Mary — wonders, “Why was everything involving a girl’s body so degrading?”
Ultimately, however, he didn’t pick one, and tried to do everything, yielding an unwieldy book that clocks in at over 700 pages. The page length itself is not as daunting as attempting to be engaged from start to finish, which was, admittedly, not easy. Emma Watson supposedly disliked the original ending of “Imaginary Friend”: One only wonders what it was considering the one he ended up publishing was so unsatisfying. It’s a shame, because Chbosky clearly has good ideas, and is engaging with religion in fiction in a way that is not often seen in the literary world. Perhaps scaling back the page count and honing in on one specific message would have been a better idea.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Judge Allison D. Burroughs’s decision to uphold race conscious admissions at Harvard, she reaffirmed the importance of thinking about how race affects our individual experiences. As her opinion acknowledges, race continues to be salient in students’ lives as “time marches on and the effects of entrenched racism and unequal opportunity remain obvious.” Fittingly, the study of race also illuminates aspects of the case itself, including the plaintiffs’ motivations, media coverage, testifying students’ stories, and the statistics presented during the trial. The dynamics surrounding the case can be better understood through interrogations of how race has been constructed in the United States.
It is this same need for examination of race that has driven students and alumni like us to call for the creation of an ethnic studies department at Harvard for almost 50 years. This past summer, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay responded to our call. In June, she announced that FAS will hire three or four faculty studying ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration, across the areas of Asian American Studies, Latinx Studies, and Muslim American Studies, this academic year.
Several peer institutions like Princeton and Stanford are conducting similar searches. Harvard’s faculty search committee has now begun reviewing applications and expects to bring final candidates to campus for a lecture series in the next couple of months.
After five decades of student and alumni advocacy, this is an exciting and promising step. However, there is still work to be done. To ensure that the hires will provide the foundation for an ethnic studies department that can flourish at Harvard, we urge the university and the faculty search committee to prioritize hiring academics with a powerful and pioneering vision for the study of race and ethnicity.
The search committee should take particular care to hire faculty whose work fits within an ethnic studies framework, and not just scholars who coincidentally study racial inequality or disparity more broadly. Academic work that broadly studies marginalized groups, though significant to the understanding of race and ethnicity, cannot be characterized as ethnic studies.
In order to articulate the difference between ethnic studies and the study of race and ethnicity, Gary Y. Okihiro — a visiting American Studies professor at Yale University — wrote in 2010 that ethnic studies addresses “power and how it articulates around the axes of race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and nation.” He worried that the field of ethnic studies was being derailed from its goal to examine “the nation-state and its particular history and formations of conquest and extermination, land appropriation and labor exploitation, regimes of inclusion and exclusion, and expansion and imperialism.” These are the lenses that he feared were being de-centered at Columbia but that we hope will be re-centered in Harvard’s iteration of ethnic studies.
At its core, ethnic studies requires a deep criticism of how we traditionally produce knowledge. It challenges how we know what we know, forcing us to question what we consider to be the “truth,” and instead finds diverse forms of meaning through interdisciplinary inquiries. Only by subverting conventional understandings of history, which often omit the lived realities of people of color, can we come to a new understanding of the world, which can only happen at Harvard if the search committee hires the right faculty.
Given their expectation that these faculty will come together to build an ethnic studies department, the faculty search committee should also hire people who are committed to actually building this department. Ideal candidates include senior faculty that have built similar programs at other universities. Faculty appointed to and siloed in their “host departments” will already face challenges in program-building. If they lack the experience necessary to build an ethnic studies department, we worry that these hires will become like rocket blueprints: While they show promise as scholars, they won’t be enough for an ethnic studies program to properly launch.
Ultimately, we believe that the ongoing faculty search is the first step in building an ethnic studies department at Harvard. Yet much more has to be done in order to fully execute this vision. Upon their arrival to campus, the new faculty need to be supported with the proper resources to build a new academic program. Such resources include adequate funding to create a new department, paid time for faculty to work on its development, and an intergenerational community of students and scholars dedicated to ethnic studies. Race consciousness must expand beyond admissions and into classrooms where ethnic studies is fully supported by students, faculty, and most importantly, administration. We are optimistic that if this search selects the right faculty, Harvard can eventually set its aims far beyond catching up with our peer institutions, and instead become a pioneer in the fields of Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim American Studies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late September, the state of Massachusetts issued a ban on the sale of nicotine and marijuana vaping-related products. The ban, set to last four months, comes in the context of a notable uptick in vaping-related illnesses and even deaths in otherwise healthy, mostly young people. It has also faced pushback for being inconsistent with allowing the sale of cigarettes and for its adverse effects on local businesses.
While we appreciate the concerns of those who view this ban as paternalistic and inappropriate, we believe that, as otherwise healthy individuals are falling ill and dying, the issue demands immediate attention. Scant medical research on these devices deepens the considerable uncertainty about their risks. Therefore, we support this limited ban insofar as it will allow authorities to assess the sources of the problem and determine appropriate regulatory solutions.
Many vape product users turn to them as an alternative to cigarettes, believing that switching would help them ease off of a cigarette addiction, or that vape products were less dangerous. Others have turned to vaping as first-time users whose adoption of this technology coincides with the relaxation of marijuana laws in states across the country and the associated rise in such products’ availability. While individuals have the freedom to engage in acts which solely harm themselves, the lack of information that exists on vaping prevents individuals from making an informed decision. Both those who have transitioned from other drugs and those who picked up vaping for the first time are relying on information, popular belief, and advertising that is dubious at best.
The companies producing and marketing some of the most popular nicotine e-cigarette and vaping products appear to have only worsened this informational asymmetry. Some companies have come under congressional investigation and scrutiny for their tactics – producing the vapes in flavors and styles that many claim are marketed toward younger demographics. Whether or not this is the goal of these companies’ marketing, research suggests that these devices have successfully taken hold in college and even in high school demographics, breaking decades-old trends of decreasing levels of smoking and introducing younger markets to highly-addictive chemicals.
Particularly because this issue significantly affects college-age students, Harvard should spearhead research efforts into vaping and work to better understand the health effects of these devices. Only when we gain a more complete understanding of the risks and benefits surrounding the use of vaping devices will people be empowered to make informed decisions about their use.
This ban will not only affect those who use vape devices, but will also significantly affect small business owners and entrepreneurs whose businesses purchased their inventories under the assumption that their sale would remain legal. Given that the ban has severely and suddenly disrupted the livelihoods of many people selling vaping-related goods, the state government should consider a plan to support affected businesses.
In the end, we should all strive to be a healthier, more informed population, and this temporary ban on the sale of vaping devices provides the foundation for meaningful study of the issue. However, the ban will only be meaningful if the pace of research — and eventually of public health education — accelerates to address the knowledge gap between popular opinion and the emerging medical consensus.

Here’s the thing people won’t tell you about travel: it is difficult.
If you’re on your own, that’s one obstacle. If you’re a woman, that’s another. If you’re a woman of color on your own, well, you might just want to stop and reconsider this whole “adventure” thing.
At least, that’s what I was thinking as I sat in the back of a musty Uber at 10:36 p.m. on a Friday where nothing had gone as planned. Against the backdrop of the humid night, a foreign city stared back at me through the car windows, seeming to challenge me as the roads stretched on. I tightened my grip on my phone, tried to still my nervous heartbeat, and told myself that I had wanted to do this.
It started with my summer internship in San Francisco — which in itself was already testing the limits of dorming life for my parents. See, in the community that I grew up in, it is not common to send your daughters to college out of state, and even less so to agreeing to letting them spend nine weeks in a place a whole time zone away.
I remember while growing up I’d vow to see the world one day, and often, my statements would be met with teasing comments that I would need to wait until I married and got a husband to travel with. Before I started college, several members of our neighborhood community came to my father and advised him against sending me so far from home — to which my father evenly replied: “She can do this, insha’Allah — God-willing.”
If it was a question of my abilities to go out into the world, my parents have no doubts. They know me, but they also know the world, and it’s a place that can be harsh and cruel, having no qualms about hurting even the most prepared of those who pass through it. Every uncle and aunty, family members, and acquaintances, know of this same world, if only because they’ve experienced the worst of it in their home countries and even here — let’s not pretend the United States is any better to women, their bodies or their rights.
Any woman on her own is vulnerable — for a hijab-wearing woman like myself, I understand the fear. I see why it might be “safer” for me to have a male companion to dissuade leering eyes and aggressive harassment. It’s a twisted thing, but that’s how society works for women.
But I could not deny the sense of wanderlust that brought me to San Francisco last summer — this burning desire to see new places and meet new people. Itchy feet had me heading to the West Coast, and that same invisible pull convinced me to check out Los Angeles while I was there.
And it was at that point that everything caught up to me with an abrupt vengeance, reminding me that I am in fact, not invincible.
Irony would have it that five minutes after my plane landed, I was abandoned by my traveling companion. I should clarify this was a guy acquaintance from my internship cohort, which should render all arguments for the security of male companionship moot. With a sudden farewell, I was on my own in a city I’ve never been in at night time no less, with the skies black and getting darker with every minute that ticked by.
There were no limos or luxury accommodations — in the throng of sweaty and impatient people crowding near the airport entrances and trying to get home, there wasn’t a friendly place in sight. For perspective, I’ll share that the rest of the weekend followed the same theme, concluding finally with a broken down bus engine on the way back that delayed my return home to an unfortunately late time given I still had work the same morning.
Without a doubt, it was one of the scarier and more difficult experiences I’ve had to deal with so far. But I don’t find myself regretting the trip, rather I look back on the weekend with appreciation for the victory of being an individual traveler who managed to hold my own.
I confess that I have not yet shared the grittier details of this story with my parents, and I imagine many daughters hold a similar silence for the harder experiences they encounter. Not because we don’t want to share our lives with our mothers and fathers, but because we know they would worry and their first instinct is to protect. There needs to come a moment however, where our parents have to trust us, not a future man or some male guardian, but us, as people who can go out into that big, scary world and not only survive it, but thrive through the challenges and tribulations that come with it.
I know there are no promises for safety: Your daughters may get hurt, we may feel pain and be struck with grief, exposed to all the terrible things you’ve always wanted to shield us from — but we will hold close to these moments of vulnerability and rise with them. Believe in us, that’s the only strength we need.

Professor Plokhii is the Mykhailo S. Hrushevs'kyi Professor of Ukrainian History. Fifteen Minutes sat down with him to discuss Ukranian history, the Trump-Ukraine scandal, and the roles that both Russia and the United States have played in shaping the country’s politics. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
FM: Ukraine is situated so that it is caught between the interests of Russia and the West. Furthermore, in an interview with The New York Times, you referred to the country as a “battlefield.” Why do you think the location of Ukraine is important to its history and its relations going forward?
SP: Ukraine turned out to be important for the history of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union officially fell apart in December 1991, which was one week after the Ukraine referendum for independence. The question that Ukranians were asked at the referendum was whether they wanted their country to go free, not whether they wanted the Soviet Union to continue. But by voting more than 90% for independence, they almost automatically finished off the Soviet Union, because Ukraine was the second largest economy.
Now Russia is trying to reassert its role in the region, [and] Ukraine again becomes a key element. Just how the Soviet Union could not continue in ’91 without Ukraine, today a reassertion of Russia’s role in the region without Ukraine being on board is a major problem. That is why this is one of the only regions other than Georgia where you see military action happening, with the annexation of territory taking place.
FM: Especially with the Trump-Ukraine scandal, we were wondering if corruption plays a role in this situation. Why are U.S. politicians so interested in getting involved in Ukraine?
SP: Let’s look at the person who first brought Ukraine into [the United States] –– Paul Manafort. Manafort was participating in the elections and trying to help one of the candidates in the democratic elections in Ukraine.
If politicians go [to Ukraine]… they don't go alone. There are people who go there to make money, to advance some business initiatives, and so forth. And people take advantage of the interests and the support that already exists in Washington, and some of those people are more scrupulous and honest than others, to put it mildly. Judging by where Paul Manafort is now, he wasn’t very scrupulous. And from what we know about Hunter Biden, at least in the information that is publicly available, there was no wrong doing on his part. So, many people believe that the whole Biden thing is just a smoke screen, an attempt to distract attention from a number of scandals that are associated with the Trump presidency.
FM: There has already been talk about Russian meddling in U.S. elections, and now we see potential meddling in elections between Ukraine and the U.S. What are your thoughts on that?
SP: We certainly still are waiting for any, not even proof, but any suggestion that there was a government effort on the part of Ukraine to get involved in U.S. politics. There are no troll factories to do that, there were none of those operations. What we see is that different parts of American politicum try to use Ukraine to advance their agenda here in the U.S. It's not Ukraine coming to the U.S. and trying to influence that, it's America coming to Ukraine looking for dirt, either on one side of the political divide or another.
FM: How do you think these developments will affect U.S. politics?
SP: We see in this presidency something that didn't happen before –– a growing suspicion that the American president is in one way or another influenced by foreign powers. That wasn't in the first decades of the 19th century, when the U.S. was just being formed as a new state. It didn't happen in the 20th or 21st century. So, historically speaking, it's a rather new development. I have no doubt that it will leave a lasting mark on American political culture, just because of its novelty and the seriousness of the accusations. Whether the accusations are right or wrong, that's a different story, but again, they're out there, they're part of the discussion, they're part of the debate. Just that discussion and debate will impact American politics for the future. In what way that will happen, I don't know, but I have no doubt that these things are very consequential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three senior varsity athletes founded the Women of Harvard Athletics club this fall, in response to what they said is an “underrepresentation” of women in athletics at Harvard. More than 100 women from 19 different varsity teams have joined the club, which aims to support athletes in part through workshops, panels, and wellness classes.
Madison Earle ’20, Olivia M. Ostrover ’20, and Mackenzie B. Barta ’20 — the group's co-founders — wrote in a statement to The Crimson that women’s athletics teams at Harvard do not receive the same media coverage, funding, or game attendance compared to their male counterparts.
“There continues to be a difference in energy in the way that people talk about and support men and women’s sports,” they wrote. “Even in cases where a woman’s program may be having more success than the men’s program, there tends to be more excitement and engagement with the men’s events.”
In addition to these structural challenges, they added that female athletes face a distinct cultural challenge based on their gender.
“On the one hand, they want to be beautiful, elegant, and polite, but on the other, strong, physical, and competitive,” they wrote.
The club hopes to address the challenges of athletic commitment and academic rigor at Harvard, coupled with issues specific to women.
“We are balancing those two [athletic and academic] aspects,” they wrote. “On top of that, we also face challenges related to mental health, body image, nutrition, and sexual harassment that come with being a female athlete.”
“The most challenging aspects of being a female athlete at Harvard are the combination of all of the above, amounting to an immense weight to carry around everyday,” they added.
Kathy Delaney-Smith, head coach for Harvard’s women’s basketball team, said mental health is a challenge for female athletes in particular.
“I think mental health is a huge consideration,” she said. “I think the whole body image piece — from nutrition, which would involve things like eating disorders, and the whole sexual identity, sexual harassment — that’s all part of a parcel of things that have a huge impact on men and women, but in particular women.”
In 2017, The Crimson reported that coaches for the women’s track and cross country teams allegedly directed athletes to overtrain and miss meals in order to lose weight. In 2016, The Crimson reported that male varsity soccer players had secretly evaluated female freshmen recruits on their physical appearances — in sexually explicit terms — for years in a document circulated between the male players via email.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in a statement that fostering an inclusive environment for female athletes is among the department’s “highest priorities.”
The athletics department responded to some student-athlete concerns last year, creating the Crimson Mind and Body Program after results from end-of-year athlete surveys showed a need for additional mental health and overall wellness resources.
The Mind and Body Program — a collaborative project between Harvard University Health Services and the athletics department — entered its second full year this fall. The program received an anonymous donation over the summer to expand on the services provided in its inaugural year.
Before the start of WHA, the Harvard Radcliffe Foundation for Women’s Athletics — founded in 1981 — focused primarily on fundraising efforts for female varsity programs, according to chair Deborah Goldfine ’85.
“In the last 15 years, [HRFWA] really focused on the fundraising side, and helping these teams be financially solvent so that they can create the opportunities for our women athletes that they do,” she said.
Goldfine added that she hopes WHA, which is led by students, will help direct efforts towards more relevant issues for current team members.
“They are going to push for things that are important to the student athletes, not what we think is important,” she said.
The club seeks to serve “women of all fitness levels,” not just those on varsity sports teams, according to Earle, Ostrover, and Barta.
“Regardless of where women are in their fitness journey, we want to support them and provide the resources to enable them to have the best possible experience with athletics,” they wrote.

Divinity School Professor and Interim Pusey Minister Stephanie A. Paulsell announced that during her tenure, Memorial Church will focus on the theme of pilgrimage.
Paulsell, who was appointed to her new role this summer after former Minister and Professor Jonathan L. Walton left Harvard, has been a faculty member since 2001 and served as an affiliated minister of the church prior to taking on her new post. Paulsell will lead the church as the University searches for a permanent minister.
Paulsell said in an interview that the concept of pilgrimage seemed well suited in characterizing the church’s leadership transition. She said that she considers pilgrimages to be “transformative” since they enable people to think about themselves and their relationships.
“My job, in part, is to help people enter that liminal space of transition and think about not just what they want the next minister to be, but who they want to be as a community,” Paulsell said. “Because it’s such a transitional year, I thought pilgrimage would be a good theme.”
Paulsell said she hopes the theme of pilgrimage will enable the congregation to consider the atmosphere it wants to cultivate, especially during a politically fraught moment in which people around the world are “on the move” seeking refuge to a safer place.
Many of the church’s events and services throughout the year will center around this theme. For example, the church has organized a reading group, trips to various places including Walden Pond, and sermons that highlight topics about social justice, according to Paulsell.
Paulsell said she wants to continue Walton's legacy in fostering a more welcoming church environment and improving the church’s role as a space for people, regardless of their religious or nonreligious backgrounds. To work toward this goal, the church’s staff is fostering connections with other religious organizations on campus, Paulsell added.
“The reform congregation of Hillel has been worshipping [in the church],” she said. “Khalil Abdur-Rashid, our Muslim chaplain at Harvard, came and preached two weeks ago on pilgrimage."
In addition to these initiatives, Paulsell said she also wants to provide the members of the congregation an opportunity to “exercise their own leadership” rather than placing too much importance on the minister.
“There's a lot of emphasis on the minister,” Paulsell said. “But an interim year is a good time for a congregation to kind of claim its own power.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Plant-based, fast-casual eatery Veggie Grill invited a number of Cambridge residents to sample menu offerings Thursday in advance of its opening on Oct. 13.
Launched in 2006, Veggie Grill currently has 34 restaurants operating along the West Coast and is seeking to expand onto the East Coast, starting with the opening of its JFK Street location. Veggie Grill, which is based in California, first announced its new Harvard Square location in July 2018.
The menu will boast a variety of sandwiches, tacos, salads, and grain bowls, according to Veggie Grill CEO Steve Heeley.
Veggie Grill’s opening comes after a period of rapid commercial turnover in Harvard Square. Square hallmarks including Out of Town News, Flat Patties, and Black Ink have all announced that they will close by the end of the year. The new restaurant will replace Wagamama restaurant, which shuttered in July 2017.
Heeley said he is excited to extend his restaurant chain to Harvard Square and Cambridge residents.
“I’m an ex-Boston resident, and I just love this area. You have the Harvard students and faculty, and all the folks that work to support Harvard and the surrounding community,” Heeley said. “We’re excited to be here because we know there’s a lot of folks looking for modern, craveable, plant-based food.”
Emmanuel S. Runes, a resident of Cambridge who attended the event Thursday, said he is excited to see more options for affordable, plant-based offerings in Harvard Square.
“I think one of the biggest things that I find frustrating about the plant-based scene in Boston and Cambridge is the lack of options,” Runes said. “To have something here that’s relatively affordable, has big variety, and has more comfort fast food options is good for the plant-based movement as a whole.”
Veggie Grill has pledged to give a portion of its proceeds to Green Cambridge, a local organization centered upon advancing environmental sustainability, according to Green Cambridge’s Executive Director Stephen Nutter.
Nutter said he is excited to partner with the plant-based franchise.
“As soon as I heard what they were doing and what their mission was with bringing plant-forward food to people and showing how regular vegetables can be incredibly delicious, it seemed like a great partnership,” said Nutter.
Dozens of Cambridge residents packed into the restaurant Thursday for its soft opening.
Cambridge resident and event attendee Wendy Feign, a self-professed long-time supporter of Veggie Grill, said she has been waiting for more than a year for the franchise to open in Harvard Square.
“I’ve been going to Veggie Grill for about 7 years now on the West Coast,” Feign said. “When I found out it was coming, I immediately got the app and I’ve been counting down for like a year-and-a-half for it to get here.”
Matthew Ayer, a pilot and vegan Instagram influencer from Boston and Los Angeles, said he believes Veggie Grill’s offerings will appeal to vegetarians, vegans, and even carnivorous fast-food enthusiasts.
“If you’re a healthier plant-based vegan or you are into the more fast food food scene like burgers and fried chicken, Veggie Grill has everything,” Ayer said. “Veggie Grill really changes your perspective on what it means to eat vegan food.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that Veggie Grill staff have shown palpable enthusiasm for the opening.
“We know how special it is, but, you know, to have other outside people talk about how much they’re looking forward to being in the Square, you know, we were really pleased to meet them,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Biologist Barbara A. Schaal charted the history of animal and plant domestication and its future implications for human society in a Harvard Museum of Natural History lecture Thursday night.
More than 150 Harvard affiliates and members of the public attended the talk, hosted by the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture as part of the ongoing “Evolution Matters” lecture series. Schall’s talk, entitled “An Evolutionary Journey through Domestication,” drew on her work as a biology professor and dean of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. She previously served as Vice President of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology during the Obama administration.
Schaal began her address by arguing that artificial selection is both a historical and ongoing genetic process.
“The domestication of plants and animals started about 15,000 or 13,000 years ago, and it is actually continuing now,” Schaal said. “Humans have a co-evolutionary interaction with plants and animals where one species as it changes influences the other species and responds to that change. [It] goes back and forth.”
Schaal primarily focused on intensified plant domestication as a practical future application of artificial selection, citing growing research on under-utilized plant species.
“There are about 20,000 edible plant species, about 2,000 of them are economically important, and about 30 of them provide most of the world’s food,” she said. “There is the potential for additional plant domestication providing new kinds of foods from the wild species that are out there.”
Schaal also argued that pursuing these untapped opportunities for plant domestication could help offset climate change.
“In a global situation where more and more population is becoming urban or in parts of the earth where agriculture is suffering because of climate change, this whole idea of expanding what we use really does rest on some of these basic fundamental principles that first came out in domestication,” she said.
Event attendee Lucas Wilbur, a senior at Concord-Carlisle High School, said he found Schaal’s theories on artificial selection to be “interesting and way different than anything else we’ve learned in school.”
Iona Brightman, a biology teacher at Vassal Lane Upper School, said she gave her 8th grade students extra credit to attend Schaal’s talk, encouraging them to hear from an expert in the field.
“Evolution is one of our units, not the one that we are doing right now, but this one is on artificial selection, so it’s right up their alley of what we are talking about,” Brightman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday he would respond to a letter penned by United States Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) last week asking him to explain the College’s decision not to renew the appointment of former Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.
In his letter, Grassley asked Bacow to respond to a series of questions about how the College made its decision not to renew Sullivan and the state of academic freedom at the University.
Bacow said it is Harvard’s practice to “always respond” to letters from senators and said he would send speeches he and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana have made that address academic freedom and the meaning of the University motto, Veritas.
“I'm going to send him a copy of the speech I gave at convocation, send him a copy of the remarks I delivered at morning prayers,” Bacow said. “We continue to advise — not just advise — but speak to our students and say that we stand for Veritas, for truth.”
Student calls for Sullivan's removal began in January 2019 after Sullivan announced he was representing former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is facing allegations of rape and sexual assault. Khurana announced Sullivan would not return as faculty dean of Winthrop House after months of campus-wide controversy and student activism.
After Sullivan announced he would represent Weinstein, students protested in Harvard Yard, held a sit-in in the Winthrop dining hall, and circulated petitions calling on administrators to remove him from his faculty deanship.
Student protests prompted the College to launch a climate review into Winthrop House, and they eventually decided not to renew Sullivan due to findings that he and co-Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson fostered an “untenable” climate within the house.
The College’s announcement came a day after The Crimson reported allegations from a dozen current and former Winthrop affiliates that Sullivan and Robinson created a toxic environment stretching back years.
Sullivan has since left Weinstein’s legal team.
Grassley wrote that his letter was not concerned with the College’s decision not to renew Sullivan and Robinson due to “individual or human resources-related reasons,” but rather about what it means for higher education more broadly.
“To be clear, it is generally Harvard College’s business as to what faculty members it employs and how it employs them,” Grassley wrote. “But this episode raises significant concerns that have implications for the state of tax-exempt higher education in the United States and how it is preparing the next generation of our Nation’s leaders.”
Bacow repeated his defense of Khurana’s decision to not renew Sullivan’s contract as faculty dean of Winthrop House during Monday’s interview.
“This was not about Professor Sullivan's representation of Harvey Weinstein,” Bacow said. “It had to do with the way in which the faculty deans at Winthrop House were discharging their responsibilities as faculty deans.”
Bacow has also spoken previously about the University’s efforts to support freedom of expression on campus. He cited his speech at freshman convocation in September, when he endorsed student activism and balanced arguments.
“I choose my words intentionally when I say standing up and speaking out are actions. They are often the most difficult when they are most worthwhile,” Bacow said at the time. “You will not regret the time you spend articulating your argument and pushing for change over the next four years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalist Naomi Klein called for immediate action on climate change and discussed her recently released book, “On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal,” at a sold-out event at First Parish Church in Harvard Square Thursday evening.
In a talk lasting more than an hour, Klein said it was necessary to declare an “all-out war on pollution and poverty and racism and colonialism and despair, all at the same time.”
Klein described the challenge of mitigating climate change as not only a natural fight, but a political fight.
“We have these very real fires of climate disruption, not just those literal fires but the droughts and the storms and on and on,” Klein said. “But we also have these political fires, these fires of hate that are also beginning to rage out of control, that are also jumping the flames from country to country.”
With regard to political threats to climate change efforts, Klein pointed to the rise of political demagogues and politicians who use natural resources for their own benefit.
“They’re tapping into that feeling of profound unease, building walls, waging war on their political opponents and the press, and this allows them to get to the real business at hand, which is plundering the last remaining wildernesses on this planet from the Amazon to the Arctic,” Klein explained.
Klein said the key to fighting climate change and the political forces driving it is in part intergenerational cooperation. She referenced the work of Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who began a worldwide school strike campaign a year ago and has since spoken before the United Nations about climate issues.
Klein said she sees Thunberg as leading a new generation that embodies another, more constructive source of fire: the “fire of our movements coming together at last.” That movement, Klein argued, is uniquely inclusive of climate justice, youth activism, indigenous rights, and fossil fuel divestment.
Fossil fuel divestment has gained increasing traction among Harvard students and faculty in recent years. Divest Harvard, the primary advocacy group on campus, has held rallies and conversations with administrators about the topic, but has repeatedly faced pushback from University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow has argued that Harvard is best positioned to address climate change if it works with fossil fuel companies, rather than divesting its endowment from the industry.
Audience member Anjali Mitra, a high school student from Brookline and member of the youth climate action group Sunrise Movement, said she believes political mobilization is a key to social change.
“The most important things are to organize, and to vote, and I guess also to strike,” Mitra said. “Everybody here has a network of people that they know and that they can help become passionate about this issue, and if every single person in this room told 10 other people to get involved, we’d start a movement.”
“I’m also an organizer for the Boston Youth Climate Strike, and so I think that leaving work, disrupting business as usual and showing our politicians and our society that we want change and we want it now is a powerful way to make a statement,” she added.
Attendee Dauro Aquino of Reading, Mass. waited in line after the event for a book signing. He said he hoped to pass on the message of climate activism to his 11-year-old daughter.
“This is one of her fights,” he said. “I hope I can catch her attention on this, and I’m in line to dedicate this [book] to her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of student activism urging Harvard Law School to publish the results of a 2017 student mental health survey, Student Government Co-Presidents Princess Daisy M. A. Akita ’15 and Daniel M. Egel-Weiss are joining calls to pressure the school to share the information.
Akita and Egel-Weiss said in an interview Monday that mental health has remained a priority during their tenure and they hope the school will commit to fulfilling this request.
“We had a very productive meeting with Dean Manning about this very issue that lasted for over an hour, and we’ve spoken with him on this topic, numerous other times,” Egel-Weiss said. “And as I’ve said, we’re very excited to see the package of reforms that he has promised, and that the administration generally has shown interest in pursuing.”
Harvard Law School Spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that the data was presented at a March 2018 meeting after data collection concluded in January 2018.
“In the fall of 2018, the School created the HLS Student Well-Being Working Group, which includes student, staff and faculty members, to further analyze the survey data and make recommendations on how we can even more effectively support students’ mental health needs,” he wrote.
While there was an open invitation for students, faculty, and stakeholders to attend the 2018 event, the mental health survey results are not online. Therefore, students who did not attend the 55-minute question and answer session cannot access the results.
Dean of Students Marcia Sells wrote in an email to students Tuesday — ahead of the American Bar Association’s Law School Mental Health Day Oct. 10 — reiterating the scope of Harvard Law School’s mental health programs.
“In recent years, the ABA, the legal profession, Harvard Law School, and law schools across the nation have rightly focused new attention on the important mental health challenges that many law students and lawyers experience,” she wrote.
Sells neither mentioned the survey results nor described upcoming Law School mental health initiatives, which Akita and Egel-Weiss said Monday they had expected to be included.
Neal wrote in his statement that the mental health working group plans to share survey findings and suggestions for future programming later this year.
“The Working Group is expected to share with the HLS community in December both a summary of survey findings as well as recommendations,” Neal wrote.
Akita and Egel-Weiss wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that they felt the Oct. 8 email was “inadequate.”
“First, after two years of analyzing the Fall 2017 survey data, the school has not released a full and anonymized report of the data, failing to deliver on promises made to our predecessors, and their predecessors,” Akita and Egel-Weiss wrote. “This data should be accessible to all students, and not simply students who are able to attend an in-person presentation. An email to students establishing a timeline for this full release would have been a good start.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) discussed his recent decision to challenge Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) for his seat in 2020 at the John F. Kennedy Jr Forum at Harvard’s Institute of Politics Thursday.
Kennedy — in conversation with Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21 and IOP Director of Student Programs Robert C. Watson Jr. ’09 — touched on a wide range of issues including political polarization, impeachment, structural reform, and the urgency of his campaign for Senate.
Kennedy, who formally announced his plans to run for Senate last month, responded to criticism from several audience members who questioned his attempt to unseat the incumbent Markey — a longstanding Massachusetts political figure who has supported progressive environmental legislation.
One audience member asked Kennedy about his family’s investments in Exxonmobil, to which he firmly defended his record on advancing climate policy.
“I’ll put my environmental record in Congress up against anybody’s,” Kennedy said. “Those assets are family assets that have been held for an awfully long time, well before I was born — I exercise no control over them whatsoever.”
Kennedy also discussed his efforts to dismantle the filibuster system, which he said inhibits efficient political action against climate change.
“I was, and am, an original cosponsor of The Green New Deal. I was on it from day one,” Kennedy said of the liberal climate action proposal. “And if you want to deliver on what the promise of what the Green New Deal is, Mitch McConnell ain’t gonna let you do it.”
With regard to issues with the filibuster, Kennedy said he is the only candidate who has undertaken meaningful work toward tackling this structural barrier to environmental action.
Attendee Luke D. M. Albert ’22 said he was initially critical of the Kennedy’s decision to run against Markey, but was reassured by his comments Thursday about his commitment to advance climate policy.
“I’d say I think the elephant in the room going in tonight was obviously a Senate primary challenge against Senator Markey, which I will say I was certainly one of the people skeptical of at first,” Albert said.
In the face of questions about his candidacy, Albert said he found the Kennedy’s responses to be direct and impressive.
“I certainly have sort of tempered my original position on it,” Albert said.
Srinivasan, who had previously worked with the Kennedy through the IOP Policy Program, said she also appreciated the straightforwardness and honesty with which she believes Kennedy responded to questions from her and the audience.
With regard to the approaching Democratic Primary for the 2020 presidential election, Kennedy voiced his support for Senator Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.).
Kennedy concluded his talk by urging audience members to vote in the 2020 election.
“This country is at a tipping point, and you all have it in your hands to actually send a message to every single other person in the United States, and every single other person around the world about what kind of nation we are, and what kind of country we will be, and what it means to be part of the United States in this moment of a vacuum of world leadership,” Kennedy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson looks to battle Cornell under the midday sun in Harvard Stadium on Saturday, history will be against the Crimson for the first time in a while.
Two years ago, Harvard entered the 2017 rendition of the contest on the flip side, boasting an 11-game win streak against the then-home team Cornell. That year was worse for the Big Red than this one, with the team playing unremarkable, having yet to post a single victory in its three former games.
The Crimson took a quick 14-0 lead by the second quarter and then didn’t score again. Cornell did though, tabbing 17 straight to break the streak.
In 2018, Harvard was again forced to make the long, winding journey to Ithaca, N.Y., for the contest. The teams looked remarkably similar to the year before, and indistinguishable to this one.
The Crimson entered 2-1, having lost a nailbiter to a strong, out-of-conference opponent in No. 20/22 Rhode Island. Also on its résumé, Harvard had bested Brown and an out-of-conference opponent in San Diego. The Big Red was 1-2, with losses to the University of Delaware and Yale, and a victory against Sacred Heart.
Remembering the loss of last season, the Crimson took a quick lead, and maintained the difference up through the fourth quarter. With 10 minutes remaining, Harvard kept a 10-point buffer, 24-14, between itself and a repeat of the year before. As it turns out, 10 points wasn’t enough. Two quick Cornell touchdowns iced the game for the home team for the second consecutive year.
This season, the scene is much the same. The Crimson is 2-1 with an out-of-conference loss to a strong team, while the Big Red is 1-2 with a win against a weak win against Marist. For some reason, this hasn’t mattered in the past.
Cornell is unique in that over the past two seasons, it has served as the foil to the Ivy League title aspirations of Harvard. The team hasn’t even been particularly good both of the seasons it has beaten the Crimson. It finished fifth and seventh in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Yet, it still beats Harvard.
“I think we’ve definitely got a chip on our shoulder this week,” said captain defensive back Wes Ogsbury. “Some of the older guys that were here for both of the losses, we have a lot of resentment for Cornell and it’s really nothing against them. It’s just the fact that we feel we’re better every year but they’ve gotten the best of us the last two years. We’ve taken those losses as lessons and we’re preparing a different type of way so far.”
This season, the location and personnel have changed.
Saturday’s contest represents the end of a three-game home stint for the Crimson which has so far been fruitful, accounting for both of the team’s two victories thus far in the 2019 season.
At a more micro level, the duel looks similar to past years as well. By virtue of being division rivals, the two squads know each other well.
“They’re big, they’re strong, they’re very physical,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They play a lot of defense. Some teams are pretty basic and you know exactly what you’re going to get. Conversely, Cornell is going to give you, three-down, four-down, bear defense, and some stuff in between. It’s a lot to prepare for.”
The Big Red looks similar to past seasons. They average high 100s in both passing and rushing per game, they maintain possession for just over half the time. One stark difference is their effectiveness at fourth downs, which — being biased by the youth of the season — is 100 percent in five attempts. On third downs, however, the team is 10 percent less effective.
Harold Coles and Mike Cantanese will be familiar names for Crimson fans. The two lead the teams offensive production in the rushing department with the former averaging 111 yards per game. Cantanese serves as one of the team’s two quarterbacks, averaging 44 yards per game on the ground and another 121 through the air. Sharing the load behind the center is Richie Kenney. He’s averaging 78.67 yards through the air each game.
“This Cornell team, if you take a play off, if you miss an assignment, it can go big,” said junior defensive back Isaiah Wingfield. “It’s just really locking in on every single rep, trying to get better.”
The two-quarterback offense is a staple of Cornell’s. Last season Cantanese served as the secondary play caller, brought in every so often to run down Harvard’s throat — and doing so quite effectively. The now-senior tallied 75 yards and a touchdown against the Crimson last season.
The quarterbacks’ favorite target downfield isn’t even a wide out, its running back Delonte Harrell. The back has 135 yards and two touchdowns on the season.
Defensively, senior safety Jelani Taylor leads the squad in tackles, with 20, while defensive lineman Nathaniel Weber has the most sacks with two for 14 yards.
“It’s championship week everytime you come up against an Ivy League team,” Wingfield said. “You have to perform. If you lose one game in the Ivy League, now you’re depending on some other teams to lose and you want to be in the driver’s seat throughout the season.”
While the Big Red’s defense has had trouble making its way into the backfield, The Crimson’s has not. The team is first in the nation in sacks per game and second in the nation with tackles for loss per game with 4.67 and 9.7, respectively. Leading Harvard in that defensive front is sophomore linebacker Truman Jones with a team-leading 13 tackles and four sacks. The team is also second in the nation in first down defense, sixth in rushing defense, and first in punt blocks.
Offensively, the team is equally robust, having tallied its highest score since 2012, last week’s 62-17 routing of Howard put the Crimson on the national map for offensive production. The team is third in the nation in scoring offense, averaging 42.3 points per game.
At the helm of that production is quarterback Jake Smith. Through three games, Smith has thrown for 737 yards and eight touchdowns, with senior wideouts Jack Cook and Cody Chrest as his favorite targets. Junior Devin Darrington leads the production on the ground with 92.3 yards per game and four touchdowns overall.
“Losing a game to Cornell, two years in a row, that early in the season, it puts you on the ropes,” Wingfield said. “It’s been a rough way to start our season for the last two years. It’s stuck with us. We’re coming into this week with greater focus and intensity than we’ve ever had, one of the best weeks of practice we’ve ever had.”
