After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust spoke to alumni in Singapore Sunday during the first stop of a trip in Asia to promote Harvard’s global impact.
At the event, Faust addressed over 400 alumni and took part in a conversation with faculty members Sunil Amrith and Tobias Walther on the role of creativity in addressing issues such as global migration and disease. Amrith teaches History and South Asian Studies, and Walther teaches at the School of Public Health and the Medical School.
Harvard Alumni Association Director and co-chair of the Harvard College Fund Geraldine Acuna-Sunshine ’92 moderated the discussion.
While in Asia, Faust will also meet with National University of Singapore President Tan Chorh Chuan and other academic leaders, before traveling to Vietnam. Faust will meet with alumni, academics, and university leaders at the Fulbright University Vietnam and the Ho Chi Minh City University of Social Sciences and Humanities, where she will give a speech entitled “Aftermath: War, Memory and History” on Thursday.
Sunday’s event was the 14th in the “Your Harvard” series, a three-year world tour organized by the Harvard Alumni Association that has taken Faust to cities such as London, Seattle, Beijing, and Berlin. At each destination, Faust speaks with alumni about “her vision for the future of Harvard, including its global reach and impact” in an effort to promote the University’s ongoing capital campaign, according to the “Your Harvard” series description.
The capital campaign, which kicked off in 2013 and is set to conclude in 2018, is Harvard’s first University-wide fundraising effort. The University surpassed its campaign goal of $6.5 billion in 2016, breaking a higher education fundraising record previously held by Stanford. With over $7 billion raised and a year left in the campaign, administrators and campaign leaders are turning their attention to unfilled priorities such as House renewal and construction of Harvard’s new campus in Allston.
Faust’s trip to Asia falls at a time when domestic policy is challenging Harvard’s global reach. Recent executive orders signed by President Donald Trump have curtailed immigration from six predominantly Muslim countries, and generated concern among international students and scholars about their ability to obtain visas in the future.
Faust voiced concerns about Trump’s most recent order, which took effect Thursday, at a faculty meeting earlier this month.
“Although the order is more narrowly drawn than its predecessor, I remain deeply troubled about its implications for Harvard," Faust told faculty members. “We face a very real risk that students and scholars from all corners of the globe may no longer see Harvard and other U.S. universities as attractive places to pursue their studies."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and Ohio State had never faced off in women’s lacrosse before the Buckeyes made the nearly 800-mile trip to Cambridge on Saturday.
In an afternoon matinee at Jordan Field, the Crimson (4-1, 1-0 Ivy League) defeated Ohio State (5-4) with an emphatic 13-7 victory. The win was the third straight for a Harvard team that has won four of its first five games for the second consecutive season.
Senior tri-captain Maeve McMahon got the Crimson on the board less than three minutes after the contest got underway. The Duxbury, Mass. native remained instrumental for the Crimson offense, coming away with eight draw controls, two goals, and one forced turnover. Harvard dominated the face-off circle, winning 14 of the game’s 22 draws.
A minute and a half after McMahon’s opening goal, sophomore attacker Nicole Baiocco scored to double the Crimson’s lead. Harvard pushed the lead to three when tri-captain Emma Ford scored with 12:52 left before the break.
“Emma Ford's coast-to-coast goal in the middle of the first half definitely provided a ton of momentum and energy for us early in the game.” McMahon said.
The energy and momentum continued for the Crimson as tri-captain Marisa Romeo finished the Crimson’s scoring for the half. Romeo’s tally was sandwiched between two Buckeye goals that would send the guests into the locker room trailing by just two goals.
The Syracuse, N.Y native led the Harvard offense with four goals to push her season total to 18. It was the third straight game in which Romeo tallied four goals. Although the Buckeyes gained momentum at points during the game, the Crimson did not allow Ohio State to lead by more than one on the afternoon. After the guests took the lead with 19 minutes to play, Harvard scored the game’s final seven goals. Romeo led the way down the stretch, scoring three of her four goals in the final ten minutes.
“Marina Burke made a huge defensive play by the checking an Ohio State girl’s stick so perfectly that not only did she drop the ball, she dropped her stick as well,” Romeo said. “It was a great play and started our comeback to win the game.”
The Crimson defense was essential to the Harvard victory as it dominated the Buckeyes with a total of 16 forced turnovers and 17 successful clear attempts from its zone. Senior defenders Marina Burke and Emma Ford and junior defender Julia Lennon each forced two turnovers. Senior goalie Meredith Brown kept out Ohio State with a total of nine stopped shots on goal.
Down 7-6, sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee tied the score with a free position attempt conversion. Feeding off the determined offense, junior midfielder Julia Glynn scored a man-up goal off a Romeo feed with 15:53 minutes of regulation time remaining on the clock.
“We did a really nice job of not getting rattled when they went on their three-goal run in the second half,” McMahon said. “We focused on playing together and responded to their three-goal run with our own seven-goal run to finish the game.”
On the afternoon, the Crimson outshot the Buckeyes, 32-17, went three-for-five in free position attempts, and held a 18-13 ground ball advantage.
“We knew this game was something we’ve circled on our calendars and really wanted to come away with a win, so we just stayed focused on our goal throughout the entire game despite when Ohio State would make runs.” Romeo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2017, at 12:20 p.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — First a Beanpot. Then a Cleary. Now a Whitelaw.
The wins keep coming, and so do the trophies. Playing in its third straight ECAC championship game, the No. 2 Harvard men’s hockey team lit the lamp in every period of a 4-1 victory over Cornell on Saturday, bringing home its 10th ECAC title in program history and extending its unbeaten streak to a program-best 16 games.
“There’s been a lot of hard work and dedication put into building a team like this, and it’s unbelievable for everything to be coming to fruition,” co-captain Devin Tringale said. “We put a lot of these things up in the locker room as goals throughout the season, and to be checking them off like we are, it’s amazing."
“This was definitely right at the top of our list,” added the senior about this championship in particular, his second conference title as a member of the Crimson. “I feel like I’ve been saying this a couple too many times, but this was a championship that we really wanted.”
One night after senior Sean Malone registered a hat trick in the semifinals against Quinnipiac, sophomore Ryan Donato took the goal-scoring baton and logged two tallies of his own in the tournament finale—both from the power play.
Donato’s first score came 14:41 into the opening period when the Ivy League Player of the Year connected from the center point to put Harvard (26-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) in front, 1-0. After a faceoff win by co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, Donato received the puck from freshman defenseman Adam Fox, faked a slapshot, then ripped a powerful wrister on net that skipped off the goaltender and in.
From there, the scoreline remained static for more than a period’s worth of action, but not for a complete lack of offensive opportunities. In fact, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said he felt Cornell (21-8-5, 13-4-5) had his team “on the ropes” several times. Yet the Crimson remained in control, largely because Merrick Madsen began to emerge as the true star of the night.
Matching his 25-for-26 stat line from Friday’s win over the Bobcats, the junior netminder made a number of stellar glove and pad saves throughout the contest to hold the Big Red at bay. Madsen held Cornell off the board entirely until only 1:17 of hockey remained, by which time Harvard’s lead had ballooned to 4-0.
“You always want your goalie to come up with the big save at the right time in the game, and I think he did that today,” Ted Donato said. “Especially when that score was 2-0, they had some great chances, and he made some incredible saves. I think when he’s on like that, which he has been in all our big games, it certainly allows the team to play with confidence.”
Madsen, whom Ryan Donato referred to as “a brick wall” in the postgame press conference, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament for his efforts. The junior was also joined on the All-Tournament team by four fellow members of the Crimson—including the younger Donato and Fox.
The other two Harvard representatives were Malone and Luke Esposito, who teamed up to double the Crimson lead with 3:52 remaining in the second period. From behind the Cornell cage, Malone set up Esposito for an in-tight attempt by Mitch Gilliam’s left post that squeaked just inside the pipe.
That was the only time Gillam was truly beaten at even strength because Harvard’s only other 5-on-5 goal was the product of an incredibly fortuitous bounce off the back boards. Three minutes into the third period, Gillam retreated behind his net to play a puck that had been dumped in by junior defenseman Wiley Sherman, only for it to take a crazy carrum back towards the goalmouth. As a result, sophomore Michael Floodstrand had an empty net to bury.
Donato added the icing on the cake—a laser from the high-slot—from the power play with 9:50 remaining, but the game had effectively already been won. Unlike Friday when Harvard had to stave off 15 shots in the final period, the Crimson allowed just six such tries to Cornell.
“I think we’re really finding form right now,” Tringale said. “Playoff hockey is obviously really important. It’s the best time of year, and it’s important that we play our best hockey now. And I think we’re doing that.”
Next on Harvard’s radar is the NCAA tournament, where the Crimson has made a first-round exit in back-to-back seasons. This year, however, Harvard will be a one-seed. As the top team in the East Regional, the Crimson will open the Big Dance Friday (4 p.m.) against fourth-seeded Providence within the Friars' own city.

The last two months after spring break are a special kind of hell here at sunny old Harvard. Students are coming right out of spring break and are caught between missing that carefree week and ticking off the days left before summer break. If the taste of approaching freedom is seriously affecting your ability to tackle your academics, consult our tips on how to inspire yourself to get through the homestretch while, you know, only crying once a day. At most.
Create an inspirational Pinterest board
Cheesy motivational posts might not thoroughly impress a ~sophisticated~ Harvard student but who are we kidding right now? You are desperate and you need this. That poorly photoshopped “Live. Laugh. Love” picture might be the answer to keeping it together during yet another all-nighter.
Make a to-do list
To-do lists can do wonders to your productivity, as crossing that pset off your list is not only oh-so-satisfying but also a pretty strong confidence booster. Your pride in finally being less of a broken mess might even motivate you to knock any upcoming assessments out of the park.
Treat yourself...
...to some new stationary. Getting new school supplies is unquestionably the best part of going back to school. So, relive that fresh new feeling of shopping at Staples with randos you met during Opening Days by engaging in some productive retail therapy. After all, that reminder to study for your LS1B quiz seems less nagging in a fancy notebook than it does in a crude push notification.
Take baby steps
Don’t get us wrong—we’re not here to promote procrastination, unless you’re procrastinating by reading Flyby ;). However, trying to tackle all of your neglected reading during the first day after break is a yugeee mistake. Please do yourself a favor and ease into your workload by dividing your tasks into manageable chunks.
Manage your sleep routine
Whether you spent the break staying up all night getting lit with your besties or wasting the hours away watching Netflix (or Netflix and chilling), your sleep schedule is probably all out of whack. Getting up for your 9 a.m. is going to be even more painful if you don’t ditch your spring break lifestyle, so it might be time to start going to bed before El Jefe's is the only place still open.
Use these tips to get back into the scholarly spirit and hold onto the fact that in two shorts months you’ll be able to shove this advice aside and embrace your inner sloth. Just hang on!
