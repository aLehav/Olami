After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few months before the 2016 election, an Indian-American classmate of mine was in conversation with two of his white female peers. “Who do you plan on voting for?” they inquired. He replied that he was unsure, and that neither candidate had appeared particularly appealing. “You’re not going to vote for Hillary?” they asked, appalled. He replied that he wasn’t so inclined, and probably would not vote at all. “You don’t know how to protect your rights as a minority,” they upbraided him.

When I heard of this incident, it set me thinking. Why do we reflexively associate minorities with liberalism and progressive thinking or, for that matter, religious people with conservatism? Surely one can be both a minority and disagree with many aspects of progressive ideology, or be religious personally but liberal in accepting others' beliefs? More generally, why is it so hard for us to understand that political beliefs don't come in neat binaries: Republican vs. Democrat, right vs. left, conservative vs. liberal? As a generation, we appear to have generally rejected perceived forms of binarism; why is it nearly impossible to accept that political views too come in a continuum — and a multi-dimensional one at that?"

Viewing politics in binary form and associating certain groups with certain beliefs (for example, minorities with progressivism) may also have disturbing implications. A recent study by professors from Yale and Princeton found that white liberals deliberately dumb down their discourse when engaging with racial minorities. The idea that minorities may consciously and intelligently choose to align themselves with ideas that are in some ways considered more “conservative” in today’s rhetoric appears, in many ways, to be an unthinkable thought.

When Kanye West, an icon of our generation, publicly embraced conservative policies, he was met with a deluge of acerbic criticism from the media. There was certainly nothing wrong with the idea of this criticism per se. West has the right to choose his beliefs and to make controversial statements; the press and media have the right to criticize him. However, West was often not criticized on the substance of his thoughts, but rather on the basis of his identity as a black man which was deemed incompatible with conservative ideas.

Media outlets made deplorable references to West’s documented mental health issues, called him a troll, and one CNN anchor viciously opined that “Kanye West is what happens when [blacks] don’t read.” I found it curious that people who claim to stand for diversity, and who often berate their political opponents for xenophobia and chauvinism, seem perplexed, even outraged, by the idea that a non-white person may disagree with them.

This behavior continues to pervade the political air on campus. In the ongoing battle between Harvard’s admissions office and Students For Fair Admissions, a standard remark of those defending the former is to point to the fact that SFFA is led by a white man who is using thousands of Asian students as pawns in his game to achieve white supremacy. Yes, SFFA is indeed led by a white man. But is it not impossibly condescending to assume that his Asian supporters lack the agency and critical thinking ability to have chosen their own path?

I am neither liberal nor conservative, nor do I identify as a Democrat or as a Republican. But in a world that views political identities in binary form, my refusal to pick a side means that I automatically get labelled as being part of the "other" side; in an overwhelmingly liberal campus, that means, most often, that I must "obviously" be on the right. We are all used to the open bigotry of the far right, but fighting this soft bigotry and asserting one's agency and independence can sometimes be just as tiring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An almost half-century-long struggle to create an Ethnic Studies department at Harvard has reignited after the departure of two tenure-track professors who specialize in Asian-American studies. In response, students and alumni penned letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and three Harvard organizations — the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, and the Coalition For A Diverse Harvard — organized a rally calling on the University to establish a formalized program for ethnic studies.
The fight for ethnic studies has long-plagued the United States and Harvard, and the loss of these two Asian-American studies professors only highlights the continued lack of resources and infrastructure Harvard provides to students and faculty interested in the field. Over the past 47 years, the University has witnessed a seemingly constant stream of petitions and demands for the institutionalization of a robust ethnic studies curriculum.
The true importance of the field, however, is not really its popularity, though we hope the University would be more attentive to student interest. The underlying importance of ethnic studies is more an issue of academic focus. Ethnic studies is an established and essential discipline of research universities across the country. Harvard’s lack of a department or center for this field places it woefully behind its peers and severely limits its capacity to be the leader in intellectual progress it claims to be.
Striving to investigate the nuances of ethnoracial identity and power, with an emphasis on the perspectives of people of color, ethnic studies provides a critical front from which to understand that which is often glossed over in by predominantly Eurocentric course catalogues. Harvard is falling behind other universities across the country in terms of recognizing the need for, and building, a formalized ethnic studies program. Yale has a Ethnicity, Race, and Migrations major. Stanford has the Center for Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity. And the University of Chicago has a B.A. program in Comparative Race and Ethnicity Studies.
The establishment of such a department at Harvard would also help to provide the necessary infrastructure to support smaller already-existing programs and the professors who are struggling to make a difference within them. In 2017, for example, the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature announced a new subfield within the concentration, allowing students to pursue an ethnic studies track. But History and Literature instructors are hired for three-year terms, so the capacity of these instructors to contribute in the long term to the department’s intellectual community is severely limited.
While we appreciate and understand that the specifics of any individual decision on granting tenure are difficult to parse, we hope the University will forge a strong commitment to Asian-American studies – among other ethnic studies fields – by actively recruiting and retaining faculty for these disciplines. The formalization of an ethnic studies program would speak to University support for an important discipline and student interest, and for its faculty. Professors do far more work than teach classes; they provide formal and informal mentorship to their students and pursue pioneering research.
The fight for ethnic studies has been long and fraught, and the field’s place on Harvard’s campus is long overdue. Harvard — embattled by a lawsuit cutting to the core of its approach to diversity — has the opportunity to bring diversity into the classroom, actualizing diversity in what it teaches not merely who it brings on to its campus. In particular, it is time for Bacow to do that which decades of presidents before have not: Introduce an ethnic studies department at Harvard’s campus, deeply affirm his commitment to creating a vibrant culture of diversity and openness across campus, and, in so doing, show he is conscious of the hopes of students, faculty, and alumni.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 25, The Crimson reported Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to defend in court Harvey Weinstein, the man whose infamous sexual misconduct and assault of over a dozen women initiated the #MeToo movement in 2017. In the following week, Sullivan upheld his choice to represent Weinstein through an email addressing the Winthrop community. Subsequent reports revealed Sullivan has also come out in public support of Harvard professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. against allegations of sexual harassment from female employees. In his comments about Fryer’s case, Sullivan disparaged both the #MeToo movement and Harvard’s Title IX procedures, calling the University’s investigations “deeply flawed and deeply unfair.”
Sullivan’s actions and statements are unfitting of a faculty dean. We condemn Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein and defend Fryer while serving as a Winthrop faculty dean. We further condemn the Harvard administration’s inaction in light of these actions.
We believe deeply in every defendant's right to attorney. But there are many lawyers who could have defended Weinstein. While Sullivan’s defense of Weinstein might be consistent with his precedent of defending the “unpopular defendant,” it is not consistent with his responsibility to Harvard students. As a faculty dean, he has a responsibility to consider how his actions will affect the environment in which his students learn and live. Winthrop students have already experienced the detrimental effects of his decision to defend Weinstein.
For survivors, hearing about other cases of sexual violence and assault can be triggering, even if only from the daily news cycle. For survivors in Winthrop, living in a House with someone who is a daily reminder of the Weinstein case could be deeply traumatic. Houses are meant to be places of refuge, where all students can feel safe and supported by faculty, administrators, staff, and peers. Sullivan’s role on the case will certainly hinder his ability to create a safe space for Winthrop survivors. His decision to designate Winthrop House Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as the House’s “point person” for sexual assault reflects his inability to properly support survivors in the community he purports to lead.
Sullivan’s comments regarding Fryer’s case further indicate a complete disregard for survivors at Harvard. Fryer has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple Harvard affiliates, meaning that Sullivan’s public defense entails casting doubt upon the testimony of members of the Harvard community. Moreover, his comments indicate a disdain for Harvard’s Title IX policy, the same policy students in his House rely on when filing complaints of gender-based discrimination, harassment, or assault.
Faculty deans are not just symbolic roles, but important “pastoral” and administrative positions for which a commitment to the well-being of members of the House community is indispensable. First, faculty deans hire and oversee all House staff, including those who implement Title IX interim measures such as deadline extensions or room changes (such as the Allston Burr Resident Dean and House Administrator), or those who provide support to survivors (CARE tutors). It is therefore the responsibility of the faculty dean to uphold the standards of Title IX. Perhaps more importantly, however, faculty deans are meant to make students of their House feel welcomed, supported, and encouraged to raise their voices against any form of discrimination. Sullivan’s dismissiveness of Winthrop students’ concerns, evident in his decision to take the Weinstein case, his emails, and his perceived intransigence when one of us attended his office hours, is a fundamental failure in his role as faculty dean.
Harvard has a history of inaction when it comes to addressing sexual misconduct and supporting survivors. In 2014, the op-ed “Dear Harvard, You Win” revealed Harvard’s inability to provide justice or even empathy to survivors. Harvard’s last climate survey, in 2015, reported that 16 percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduate females reported they had experienced nonconsensual sexual penetration or attempted nonconsensual penetration during their time at the College. Harvard failed to address sexual misconduct from Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez for nearly 40 years, and he still retains his professor emeritus status today.  The administration cannot continue to be complicit while students suffer. As others have said, the faculty dean system is a top-down structure with limited accountability. Because of this, it is the College’s responsibility to oversee faculty deans and to intervene when they can no longer support healthy House life.
We believe Harvard should do what is right for survivors. For these reasons, we demand that the Harvard administration immediately remove Sullivan from his position as faculty dean of Winthrop House. Furthermore, we demand that Sullivan formally apologize for making students and survivors feel ignored in their own Houses. Finally, as Lowell House Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck said at a student-led rally on Monday, the faculty dean role entails “a certain amount of hard decision-making.” We believe that this role must be clarified.
We demand that Harvard develop a system of accountability for faculty deans and establish clearer standards for faculty dean behavior. To start, we suggest that faculty deans should ensure the safety and well-being of all students and workers in their houses, including survivors, transgender and gender non-conforming people, BGLTQ people, undocumented, DACAmented, and TPS people, indigenous people, first generation and low-income people, people of color, people with disabilities, and people otherwise marginalized, and respect the concerns and voices of all people in their House communities.

A transgender woman filed a lawsuit against Harvard and Office for Dispute Resolution investigator Brigid Harrington alleging the University violated Title IX law and Massachusetts laws by discriminating and retaliating against her after she reported an admissions officer for sexual harassment.
The 15-page complaint — filed Jan. 22 at the United States District Court for Massachusetts — details several instances in 2017 when the plaintiff, dubbed “Jane Doe” throughout the document, said she was sexually harassed and discriminated against on the basis of her transgender status. The complaint alleges that shortly after she reported an admissions officer for sexually harassing her, she was denied admission to Harvard Business School and the Graduate School of Education.
The lawsuit states the complainant faced “two express incidents of gender-based discrimination” that the “defendants failed to either investigate or act on.” It names the University, the Board of Overseers, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, and Office for Dispute Resolution investigator Brigid Harrington as defendants.
Harrington declined to comment.
The plaintiff lays out a series of demands in the suit, asking the University and Harrington to issue a “declaratory judgment” admitting they unlawfully retaliated against her in violation of Title IX and state law. Title IX is a federal law prohibiting institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating against people on the basis of gender. The complaint names several Massachusetts laws that Harvard allegedly violated, including laws that prohibit discrimination and retaliation on the basis of gender or sexuality.
The plaintiff also asks for a “permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not discriminate against transgender students and individuals,” legal fees and other costs, and “other and further relief” that the Court feels is necessary.
The complainant alleges that, in October 2017, a male admissions officer from the Business School forcibly kissed her at a BGLTQ open house and that the University unlawfully discriminated against her in the admissions process. According to the suit, Doe received a message notifying her that she had been denied admission to the Business School “within days” of reporting the misconduct.
A Business School admissions officer allegedly told the plaintiff in 2017 that the University had not admitted any transgender students over the past three admissions cycles, according to the complaint.
The complaint states Doe then sent an email to “various Harvard University admissions personnel” in February 2018, in which she communicated her concern that she would face discrimination as a transgender individual, referencing the comments made to her by the Business School admissions officer. Several days later, Doe received a response from the Director of Admissions at the School of Education Julia B. Deland that reminded Doe of the University's non-discrimination policy. On March 2, 2018, Doe was denied admission at the School of Education.
The lawsuit states Harvard’s “intentional and knowing refusal” to investigate the alleged incidents of discrimination was a violation of Title IX policy. The suit also alleges that the plaintiff was “retaliated against by Defendants” for reporting the incident. The suit goes on to say that the plaintiff also experienced “sexual harassment” under Massachusetts law.
The January filing is not the first time the plaintiff has tried to take legal action against Harvard for the alleged discrimination she faced. The plaintiff filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on June 4, 2018, alleging the University discriminated against her based on gender identity.
The University requested the complaint be dismissed for lack of probable cause and alleged that the complainant was not a competitive applicant to the Business School and the School of Education, according to the January complaint.
MCAD later issued an investigative disposition that found a lack of probable cause, but the federal complaint said the MCAD disposition statement “totally failed” to sufficiently address the assault and how it violated Title IX policy. The complaint also alleges that the University refused to investigate or acknowledge the assault had occurred.
Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny wrote in an email that the University “does not generally comment on pending litigation” and that Harvard had not yet been served with the federal complaint, but they “can confirm” the allegations of discrimination were first raised in the MCAD investigation that was dismissed.
“Harvard Business School has stringent policies against the kind of conduct alleged in the complaint, and has thorough procedures to address it should any such behavior occur,” Kenny wrote. “Further, the School strives to attract and recruit a student population that is diverse in every dimension and to create a campus environment where every student can reach their full potential regardless of race, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religious affiliation or sexual orientation.”
School of Education spokesperson Bari E. Walsh wrote in an emailed statement that the school is “dedicated” to recruiting a diverse set of students, faculty, and staff.
“Harvard and the Harvard Graduate School of Education have strong policies against the kind of conduct alleged in this complaint, and we have comprehensive procedures in place to address it,” Walsh wrote. “In addition, HGSE is deeply committed to fostering a campus climate of inclusion and belonging.”
Doe is requesting a jury trial for the lawsuit. Doe’s lawyer Cynthia MacCausland did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Martha Whitehead, the vice provost for digital strategy and university librarian at Queen’s University in Ontario, has been named as the next leader of the Harvard University Library system, the University announced Tuesday.
Whitehead’s appointment comes months after former University Librarian Sarah E. Thomas announced her retirement last year. She led the system for five years.
“I am thrilled to be joining Harvard, where the library and the University’s mission are so interwoven, and where there is such a rich legacy to build upon,” Whitehead said in a press release. “I’m honored to be entrusted with leading the library forward during this complex period in the information realm.”
Her selection comes after an international search conducted by a committee comprising University faculty members, administrators, and library leaders. The search process also included two town-hall meetings.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to University affiliates that they are “delighted” that Whitehead will take the helm of the Harvard Library.
“The library is one of Harvard’s greatest jewel,” Garber said in a separate press release. “Martha recognizes that it is a uniquely valuable resource to our students, researchers, other members of the Harvard community, and to the world. She is singularly qualified to take this institution to the next level.”
At Queen’s University, Whitehead led strategic planning initiatives and oversaw organizational changes, including fostering digital research infrastructure and implementing new information systems, according to the release.
Whitehead joins the Harvard Library system as several of the University’s 25 libraries are in the process of digitizing their collections and renovating their spaces.
Cabot Science Library reopened in 2017 after undergoing a complete renovation. Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute began renovations in November 2018 and will remain closed until September 2019. In January, the University announced plans to renovate Houghton Library, which houses Harvard’s rare manuscript and book collection, and in December Harvard announced an upcoming merger of Harvard Library and Grossman Library that will provide full Harvard Library access to all Harvard Extension School students.
Gay said in the press release that she is excited Whitehead will be heading the University library system.
“In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, we are doubly grateful to have Martha joining Harvard,” Gay said. “Not only will we benefit from her exciting vision for the Harvard Library system, but in her role as the Roy E. Larsen Librarian she will be deeply embedded in our community and joined in our efforts to advance knowledge across the broadest spectrum of fields.”

Datamatch, a free matchmaking service run by the Harvard Computer Society, is now available to students at 13 schools.
Program organizers expanded Datamatch's reach from last year, when the service was available at four colleges and universities. HCS, which launched the program in 1994 exclusively for Harvard College students, also offered Datamatch to students at Brown University, Columbia University, and Wellesley College in 2018.
Datamatch’s efforts to partner with campus satirical publications was critical for its expansion, according to co-Supreme Cupid Russell F. Pekala ’19, who helps oversee the program at the College.
"We wanted to pair with people that would want to do the stuff we were unable to on the ground at those schools, which included writing school-specific questions, getting the word out about Datamatch, getting people excited about it,” Pekala said. “That's why we kind of targeted organizations similar to Satire V at other schools.”
This Valentine’s Day, Datamatch will share the love on thirteen other campuses, in addition to Harvard: Boston College, Brown University, Carleton College, the University of Chicago, the Claremont Colleges, Columbia University, Cornell University, MIT, Wellesley College, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Washington University in St. Louis, and Yale University.
Michael Dizon, a student at Washington University in St. Louis, worked alongside two other students to lead Datamatch’s efforts on his campus. Dizon wrote in an email that he enjoyed launching the service on campus.
“At first I became really apprehensive about taking on what felt like a massive task…and I wanted to decline the offer until next year, when I had more time to prepare,” he wrote. “But I had a long call with Russell Pekala, and I remember him saying, ‘As long as you would have fun running this, we would have fun supporting it.’ So I started to have fun with it.”
Pekala said the support Harvard Datamatch organizers have given to students at other schools has helped them bring the program to their campuses. Harvard organizers have overseen the service's matchmaking algorithm, provided students with materials to help with publicity, and helped them send mass emails to other undergraduates, he said.
Brown University’s Datamatch team will host a party on Valentine’s Day this year with Small Victories, an event promotion and management company, to provide students with the opportunity to meet their matches, according to Cashen Conroy, a Brown student who is part of the campus’s Datamatch team.
Conroy said that, though campus Datamatch coordinators worried that the “novelty” of the service would wear off after last year’s debut on campus, the party is already drawing interest among students.
“We had a lot of success with Datamatch last year,” she said. “So coming into the second year, I was a little apprehensive that a huge part of that may have just been the novelty of it in its first year. But the numbers are looking pretty good. The party is sold out which is exciting.”
Matches will be released on February 14 across the country.
Correction: Feb. 20, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Datamatch has expanded to 14 schools, including Harvey Mudd College and the Claremont College consortium, this year. In fact, Datamatch has expanded to 13 schools; Harvey Mudd is a part of the Claremont College consortium though the Datamatch website lists the two separately.

Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus C. Wickham “Wick” Skinner — an educator, strategist, leader, and philanthropist — died in his home in St. George, Maine, on Jan. 28 at the age of 94.
Skinner’s research and writings focused on business administration, specifically on the management of manufacturing. He was a prolific writer, having authored or co-authored 10 books, contributed to multiple business case books, and published more than 75 articles in the Harvard Business Review, including his well-known 1969 piece “Manufacturing — the Missing Link.” In it, he explored the role technology plays on the factory floor and urged factories to alter their manufacturing structures when introducing new equipment.
Lawrence A. Bennigson, a senior fellow at the Business School, who had known Skinner since 1968, said Skinner pioneered new strategies in the administration of manufacturing; such strategies did not exist before Skinner’s research.
“You know, you think of financial strategy, you think of marketing strategy, you’d say, ‘Well of course, there would have been manufacturing strategy.’ But you know, 50 years ago, there really — there wasn’t. And his work to help the managers and executives to frame manufacturing in a strategic way was just a major step, major step forward,” Bennigson said.
Before attending the Business School, Skinner volunteered for the army and was assigned to work on the Manhattan Project as an engineer.
Following the war, Skinner attended the Business School and graduated in 1948. He then worked in manufacturing at Honeywell, a technology company, for 10 years before returning to the Business School for his doctorate.
“He had this very sound basis — the combination of in-depth experience in industry and the master’s and doctoral training of business administration,” Bennigson said. “That combination, I think, was very important for him in what was eventually his ability to bring a new, a powerful perspective to the world of manufacturing.”
Skinner brought his insights on manufacturing with him to the classroom, as he became a faculty member of the Business School. In his 1960 course about advanced production problems, he taught about industrial situations and the variable approaches one could take to address them. In his course about manufacturing technology, he taught students that the incorporation of technology should be accompanied by other organizational changes.
Skinner frequently invited students to his home for dinner and discussion, bringing educational conversations outside of the classroom.
“He would always prepare a provocative statement or question, you know, to put on the table, probably around dessert time,” Bennigson said. “And then he would promote and contribute to it, but really encourage an open, exploratory conversation about that issue. That was a hallmark of those dinners with Wick.”
When Skinner moved to St. George, Maine after his retirement in 1984, he continued to have productive and educational conversations, according to Mary Alice Bird, who collaborated with Skinner on a capital campaign for the Farnsworth Art Museum of Rockland, Maine.
“The discussions we always had were very far-ranging about many, many subjects,” she said. “You could always count on Wick to be strong in expressing his opinions but to seek out and want to hear those of other points of view and then to bring them in to try to form a point of consensus.”
John A. Bird, Mary Alice Bird’s husband, said Skinner was an “active listener” in these conversations.
“You always felt very good when you left Wick’s presence. He was really quite extraordinary,” he said. “To me, that’s what a great teacher does. They lift your horizons and make you feel good about it, like you’re doing it yourself.”
Skinner remained active in his retirement, taking up hobbies like flying planes, painting watercolors, and writing memoirs. He also became involved in local institutions, serving on the boards of the University of Maine and the Farnsworth Art Museum.
“His approach was: if we can make it better, let’s make it better,” Farnsworth Art Museum Director Christopher J. Brownawell said.
Skinner at one point launched himself into saving the local Strand movie theater — a “flagship cultural institution” for Maine residents, according to John Bird.
When the theater’s previous owner died suddenly, Skinner took part in the deliberations over what should be done with the theater, ultimately deciding to hand ownership over to Rockland residents.
“He was right at the epicenter of these things that were happening that were good for the community, and you know, he wasn’t seeking any glory or anything,” John Bird said. “He just wanted good things to happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Legal experts say judges will likely not immediately dismiss two lawsuits alleging Harvard’s single-gender social group penalties are illegal.
Lawyers for the University filed two motions to dismiss the suits — one in state court and the other in federal court — Friday evening. But according to analysts, Harvard’s arguments are unlikely to convince the judges to throw out the cases right away.
The lawsuits, filed in December 2018, allege the College’s sanctions on single-gender social organizations constitute sex-based discrimination and infringe upon students’ freedom of association. In their initial complaints, the plaintiffs allege the policy violates the United States Constitution and federal anti-discrimination law Title IX, as well as the Massachusetts Constitution and the state’s Civil Rights Act.
The social group policy, which took effect with the Class of 2021, prohibits members of single-gender Greek organizations and final clubs from holding campus leadership positions and athletic team captaincies, as well as from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
Plaintiffs in the Massachusetts case are the international parent group of sorority Alpha Phi, Harvard’s newly reinstated chapter of Alpha Phi, and a management company for chapters of sorority Delta Gamma. In the federal suit, the plaintiffs are the international organizations for two sororities, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma; the parent groups for two fraternities, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi; Harvard’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon; and three anonymous College students who are also members of all-male social clubs.
Sean P. Callan, an attorney at Fraternal Law Partners, said he thinks it would be “difficult” for the judges in both cases to dismiss the suits at this stage.
Harvard argued in its Friday filings that the international Greek organizations do not have standing to bring the suits because they are speaking on behalf of their members. Callan, though, said he believes the courts will need more information to evaluate the University’s claims, so the cases will likely proceed.
“I think that the arguments that Harvard's advancing are inherently fact-driven, and I don't think that just on the face of these pleadings, that we can say that these plaintiffs have not alleged claims. I think it's going to take further factual development,” he said.
Peter F. Lake, a law professor at Stetson University, said he thinks it is likely the legal proceedings will continue in the short term but that he is “not so sure” that the case will move to trial.
“My instinct is that this is probably going to move forward in some form,” Lake said. “It has the earmarks of something that could be resolved after some discovery at a later date on motions for summary judgement.”
Other legal experts addressed the specific allegations in the case against Harvard.
Douglas E. Fierberg, an attorney who specializes in cases related to violence in higher education and Greek organizations, said he thinks Harvard’s policy applies equally to men and women. The plaintiffs have argued that the policy punishes students on the basis of sex.
“I do not believe that [the policy] discriminates…I think it gives fair notice to everyone that there will be certain academic privileges that Harvard will withhold for individuals choosing these particular groups,” Fierberg said. “And I think people have been given notice of that. They can go in eyes wide open to make decisions for themselves, and it doesn’t discriminate.”
He said given these aspects of the policy and its implementation, Harvard’s argument is the “stronger of the two positions.”
Attorney Gregory F. Hauser said he thinks the University took a standard legal route with its filings, while the plaintiffs’ arguments are “ones that push the boundaries of the law.”
“Harvard's made a polished argument based on very well-established legal principles,”Hauser said. “Harvard has largely confined itself to saying, ‘no, don't push the boundaries of the law.’
“Precisely because the plaintiffs are plowing some new legal ground, the short answer is I don't think it's very easy to predict what the court's going to do with this. This is a real high-level intellectual clash on what this broad language in the law means,” he added.
Lake said he thinks the outcome of the lawsuits could set precedents for future cases involving Title IX and gender-based discrimination.
“I think we’re all watching this case as a kind of test case for private colleges in particular that have decided to take management approaches to complying with Title IX,” Lake said.
The plaintiffs will file written responses to Harvard’s motions over the next several weeks. The University has requested oral hearings in each of the lawsuits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and employees joined thousands of marchers from across the country in Washington D.C. Tuesday to rally for the preservation of Temporary Protected Status, a program that provides some immigrants with temporary refuge in the United States if their home countries are affected by armed conflict or natural disaster.
“I believe in the power of marches like this one. I don’t think Trump is really scared of 5,000 people showing up in D.C. It happens often for various issues,” Salma Abdelrahman ’20, who traveled to D.C. for the march, said. “I think it’s more about what conversation this sparks. It’s easy to end TPS when no one knows what TPS is.”
The march began at 10 a.m. with a press conference in front of the White House, where Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) spoke to attendees. Then, roughly 5,000 people marched toward Capitol Hill in the rain, ending their demonstration hours later in front of Congress, according to Harvard employee and attendee Julio Perez.
Perez, who came to the United States from El Salvador and was granted TPS 18 years ago, is protected until this upcoming September or — potentially — next March, if legal efforts to prolong protections are successful. Perez said he thinks as many as 60 to 100 Harvard employees are TPS recipients.
The Department of Homeland Security announced in September 2017 that it would end TPS for six of 10 protected countries. Individuals from those countries — El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan — make up about 95 percent of TPS holders. More than 400,000 individuals from those countries are TPS holders.
Perez — who is on the Massachusetts TPS Committee, a member of the Harvard TPS Coalition, and a custodian at the Harvard Art Museums — said the march was like “a flame on the road under the water.”
“The rain was not able to shut it down, turn it off,” he said. “These people were on fire.”
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers representative Geoff Carens, who went to D.C. to support fellow Harvard marchers, said the crowd stopped at the Trump International Hotel as they proceeded through the city.
“There was a display created that was basically a wall created out of cardboard or poster-board. There was a destruction, a tearing down of the wall, a symbolic ripping down of barriers,” Carens said. “That was a very affecting display. It got a lot of attention.”
“I am aware that there is a tremendous amount of hatred and harm being inflicted on immigrants by our government and, in particular, our president,” Carens added. “Obviously, many of these people with TPS status have been here for decades, and they really don’t have connections to the places where they are going to be shipped back to. So, it’s a humanitarian crisis.”
Activism surrounding TPS holders is nothing new at Harvard. Last semester TPS advocates met with University President Lawrence S. Bacow about the University’s approach to supporting its TPS workers. Before that, former University President Drew G. Faust also urged lawmakers to protect the program.
For Perez, his advocacy for maintaining TPS protections is not easy, but it is necessary.
“I have no vacations anymore, I only have sick time,” he said. “But I’m not going to stop doing this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in four years, Harvard has a shot at taking home the Beanpot. A rough January now long gone in the rearview mirror, the Crimson enters the match against No. 7/8 Boston University red-hot on a six-game unbeaten streak.
Harvard’s last run to the Beanpot Finals came in 2015 in the midst of a historically dominant season. The Crimson entered the game 18-4-2 and would go on to appear in the Frozen Four, before losing in the national championship against the Minnesota Golden Gophers.
This year’s team posts a decidedly less dominant 10-11-3 record heading into the Beanpot, but being an underdog in the battle for Boston is nothing new to the Crimson — the 2015 championship team faced the nation’s best in No. 1/1 Boston College (27-0-1, 18-0-0 WHEA). Luckily for this year’s Harvard squad, both games of the 41st Women’s Beanpot have ended in upsets.
“The Beanpot is an unbelievable opportunity,” co-captain Kate Hallett said. “Only four teams in the country get to take part in this, and we’re one of them…. This is the first time in my career that we’ve made it to the Beanpot Championship…. It’s something that is really special to be a part of, and we’re just really grateful for the opportunity.”
Like this year’s Harvard team, the 2015 squad was fighting to give its seniors their first Beanpot Championship — and Boston bragging rights. Despite a 10-2 demolition by the Eagles early in the 2014-15 season, the Crimson pulled off a 3-2 upset for one of the signature wins of its national title-game campaign.
Before the 2015 victory, the Crimson’s last Beanpot triumph came in 2010. A common factor between 2015 and 2010? Both games were played at the Crimson’s Bright-Landry Hockey Center — the site of this year’s final.
“To have it at your own rink, it’s protecting your barn and really owning your rink,” sophomore forward Becca Gilmore said. “The last time Harvard won was in 2015 on home ice. We walk by that picture everyday. I’m excited to hopefully get another win.”
The Crimson is on a tear coming into the game, going unbeaten in its last six (5-0-1), good for the third-longest such streak in the NCAA. The team will face a tough test against Boston University as the Terriers have been even hotter of late, compiling a ten-game unbeaten streak (8-0-2) that ranks first in college hockey.
“Knowing that they are on a high right now, I think we just have to note that but not focus on that,” Hallett said. “We need to focus on our own game, what we’re there to do—kind of block everything else out.”
Over the weekend, BU flexed its high-flying offense with a 7-1 win over Holy Cross. The Terriers have outscored opponents by a margin of 26-12 in their last five.
The Terriers can also keep their cool in tight games. In the semifinals last week, BU eked out a shootout victory against No. 3/3 Northeastern after overtime ended, despite having trailed twice earlier in the game.
“They’re a team that’s not going to go away,” Gilmore said. “It’s going to take a full 60 or more minutes to win the hockey game, and we can’t take a shift off.”
Harvard should be up for the challenge. In recent tough games, the Crimson has also found the resolve to come from behind. During the six-game unbeaten streak, two games, including the Beanpot Semifinal against BC, have seen Harvard go down early only to battle back for the win.
With a nationally-ranked lineup, BU has players to watch. Sophomore forward Jesse Compher, who scored a power-play winner against the Crimson in the teams’ last meetup, ranks sixth in the nation in points per game (1.72) and second in assists (1.17). On the back end, sophomore goalie Corinne Schroeder posts a .929 save percentage.
Harvard, though, has experience against high save percentages. In last weekend’s game at RPI, the Crimson faced senior goalie Lovisa Selander, the record holder for most career saves in NCAA history. Harvard knew what it had to do, constantly pressuring the net and putting up 56 shots en route to a 2-1 win. This marked the Crimson’s second night of the month with 50 or more shots, with the other coming two weekends ago against Brown.
High shot numbers are less of an obstacle for Harvard’s defense, with freshman goalie Lindsay Reed’s nation-leading .945 save percentage. Pressure seems to have little impact on her ability to block the puck. In her first-ever Beanpot game, Reed notched a jaw-dropping 52 saves, allowing only one goal to help the Crimson to a 4-1 victory despite being outshot 53-26.
Defensive play has been a strong suit for the Crimson all year. The team is only giving up 2.17 goals per game. Strikingly, on four separate occasions, Harvard has given up one goal or fewer yet failed to secure a win (three separate 1-0 defeats and a 0-0 tie). The Crimson’s defense has been hot even in offensively cool games.
“One thing that we’ve talked about is just owning the front of our net—net-front battles, picking up sticks,” said Hallett. “If someone shoots a puck from the point or from the outside, we’re making sure that we’re man-on-man and taking those opponents’ bodies outside the front of our net so that our goalies can see the puck really well.”
The offense, however, is now finding the back of the net—and at a dramatic pace. Over its first 19 games of the season, Harvard averaged only 1.63 goals per game; in the last five, the Crimson has been averaging 4.2 goals per contest.
Part of the offensive boom could be the new line combination of Gilmore, sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich, and freshman forward Dominique Petrie. The triumvirate, assembled only five games ago, has already combined for 21 points. Having a healthy, fully-staffed roster—the lack of which was the team’s Achilles heel in a January slump—is another key.
While the game will of course require technical expertise from the Crimson, the storied history of the Beanpot will create an environment of raw competition where anything can happen — a setting that can be conducive to an underdog.
“[The seniors] are one of the most deserving classes to get a title,” Gilmore said. “You know that they’re going to give 110% of their effort, so we’re going to match that and get a huge win for them and our team.”

A scoreless third means the game will head to a 20-minute period of sudden-death overtime. Lindsay Reed and the Harvard backline held strong despite back-to-back BU power plays at the end of the final frame, withstanding 16 shots from the Terriers to keep the game tied. The Crimson, shifting its focus by necessity to defense, was held to only six shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season-high six-game unbeaten streak for Harvard came to a close Tuesday night with an overtime loss in the Beanpot Championship against No. 7/7 Boston University. Freshman goalie Lindsay Reed posted a 51-save effort — complementing her 52-save performance to best Boston College in the semifinals — on her way to earning the Bertagna Award for top goaltender in the Battle for Boston.
The effort would not be enough for the Crimson (10-12-3, 8-8-2 ECAC) as BU redshirt junior and tri-captain Sammy Davis lasered a power-play overtime winner past Reed to give the Terriers (17-6-7, 13-5-5 WHEA) a 3-2 win. The victory marks their first Beanpot title as a varsity program, and their second title in school history — the first coming in 1981.
Despite BU’s overtime clincher, Harvard earned a considerable share of zone time in extra play, putting up nine shots on goal compared to the Terriers’ six. Halfway through overtime, the Crimson looked poised to score, generating a frenzy of shots that BU sophomore goalie Corinne Schroeder turned away, Terrier defenders blocked, and BU forwards scrapped to chip out of the zone.
“Overtime was honestly our best period,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We had it going. We certainly had a lot of chances. Their goaltender came up big, and once again, our goaltender stood on her head…. I thought our players obviously deserved a better fate, but BU also earned the victory.”
After several minutes of promising chances and near misses, Harvard’s overtime offensive momentum would be quashed with a decisive penalty. With 7:06 of sudden-death remaining, co-captain and forward Lexie Laing took a penalty for roughing.
Just 34 seconds later, BU sophomore forward Jesse Compher threaded a pinpoint pass to an open Davis. Receiving the pass between the dots, Davis rifled the puck into the back of the net to earn the Beanpot title, launching the Terriers’ bench and student section into euphoria.
“I just looked at Jesse [Compher], and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, we just won the Beanpot,” said Davis. “It was crazy — we just made history. We’ve been working really hard this year, and it just paid off.”
As the scoreline would suggest, the game was a battle at all junctures, and the path to overtime was rocky for both teams. BU needed to come from behind to even the score at two, and Harvard had to fight off consecutive Terrier power plays to close regulation.
With 6:59 to go in the third, co-captain and forward Kate Hallett committed a high-sticking minor. Upon killing Hallett’s minor, a miscommunication on the post-penalty line change resulted in a Harvard penalty for too many players on the ice.
Just seven seconds after the conclusion of her initial trip to the sin bin, Hallett found herself back in the box. Undeterred, the Crimson relied on its season-long traditional defensive strength to earn back-to-back penalty kills and send the matchup to OT.
“We did a great job of killing penalties up until the very end of the game tonight,” Stone said. “Just a little miscommunication there at the end for us, but I think we’ve been doing a great job of killing penalties for a while now. We showed it tonight — they’ve got a strong power play. It was business as usual.”
Looking back to the beginning of the contest, the teams played physically and generated a number of chances through the first 18 minutes of play, yet the back of the net eluded both sides. That changed with 1:32 left in the first period when BU tri-captain Reagan Rust squeaked a point shot through traffic and into the top shelf to give the Terriers a power-play goal and 1-0 lead.
Wasting no time, another defender converted on the power play — but this time it was Harvard senior Kaitlin Tse. Gathering the puck in the high slot, Tse strung a wrister into the top-right corner to even the game at 1-1 before the first intermission.
“It was just a high-energy last two minutes of the period, both offensively and defensively, and then going back to the locker room, we were going back to the start of the game, 0-0, 1-1, tie game,” Laing said. “We tried to feed off the energy that we had when we scored the goal and then just tried to carry it out.”
Special teams played a huge role in the game for both sides. Both Crimson goals came on the power play, and BU would net two of its three scores on the five-on-four advantage.
Building off momentum from the close of the first, Harvard would add its second power-play goal just five minutes into the middle frame.
Controlling the puck on the left side of the net from just a few paces above the goal line, freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere fired to the low far side. Ricocheting off Schroeder’s pad, the puck bounced back into the slot before caroming back into the goal.
Laing had been standing in front to create the tangle of sticks and skates off which the puck deflected. In fact, the officials initially credited the goal to Laing, but the scorekeepers later changed the point to a Della Rovere tally. Regardless, Harvard was in the lead.
Just minutes later, still holding a 2-1 lead, Harvard earned its third power-play opportunity of the game. With a flurry of blocked shots, saves, and desperation clearances, however, the Terriers kept the Crimson out of the net.
“It was a huge kill, because 3-1 is a tough hole to get out of playing against an all-world goalie like Lindsay and a team that’s competing in their own building,” BU coach Brian Durocher said.
Fueled by the successful penalty kill, the Terriers emerged with a faceoff win in Harvard territory with just under five minutes left in the second. After a blue-line shot from BU junior defender Abby Cook, the puck deflected through defenders, hit Reed, then trickled off the post. As the puck remained loose, a scrum broke out for possession. Gaining inside position, junior tri-captain Natasza Tarnowski tapped the puck in to knot the game.
“We get a neat little faceoff play where Abby Cook gets it at the point and sees Tasza Tarnowski and throws a nice little wrist pass down there, and she gets a piece of it, tips it, and Lindsay [Reed] comes up and makes the save, but she [Tarnowski] somehow kept it alive or knocked it out of her equipment, and bingo it’s in the net,” Durocher said. “Now we’re there to hang around until we get deep into OT.”
Although Harvard’s Beanpot dreams have come to an end for this year, the Crimson’s season is far from over. With four games to go in ECAC play and playoff positioning still uncertain, Harvard will be flipping its focus to a pair of crucial league games. The Crimson returns to Bright-Landry at 6 p.m. on Friday to face St. Lawrence in a pivotal matchup before shifting attention to another top-ten opponent in No. 4/4 Clarkson at 3 p.m. on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two months into its season, the Harvard women’s water polo team has found itself amending the history books. Off a perfect 9-0 start, the No.16 Crimson has jumped out to the program’s best start to a season since its founding in 1997.
Starting its season in New Rochelle, N.Y., Harvard faced off against Iona and Villanova. The Crimson got out to a commanding lead against the Gaels before undergoing a scoring rally as each side tacked on goals for their respective teams. However, the Gaels were no match for the late-game heroics from first-year attacker Borden Wahl and senior attacker Kristen Hong, as the game ended with Harvard tallying 10 goals to Iona’s seven.
Against the Wildcats, Harvard doubled its output from the contest against the Gaels, scoring 20 goals with contributions from Hong, senior defender Haley Bowe, juniors Sofia Carrera-Justiz and Lana Gorlinski, and first-year Inde Halligan.
For their impressive performances, Halligan and Hong, last year’s team leader in goals and steals, were honored by the CWPA as Division-I players of the week. Halligan was also awarded the Rookie of the Week award for her performance.
The first weekend of competition included some of Harvard’s freshman talent on display. The team, composed of a balanced mix of members in each year, includes five first-year members. Inde Halligan contributed early on, netting one in her first period of collegiate play. The Sydney, Australia, native continued the scoring in the second game, contributing to the 20 goal-total that dwarfed the Wildcats’ 12.
Wahl, a Greenwich, Conn., native, scored in her first game as well, adding a goal in the final period against the Gaels. Finally, Zoe Banks’ debut in goal for the Crimson was a success, as she tallied seven saves and assisted on a goal versus Iona.
“A lot of the reason why we’re seeing success is because of the freshman class that just came in,” said Hong when discussing the factors contributing to the team’s success early in the season. “They’re really smart. Coach Minnis has recruited girls with higher and higher water polo IQ’s.”
The following weekend, the program made history in its stint at the Bruno Classic hosted by Brown University. After taking care of No. 16 Wagner and Siena on the first day of competition, Harvard faced off against LaSalle the following day. Not only did the Crimson win by its largest margin of the season, but it also recorded its first shutout in program history. To go along with the 17 netted goals on the day, the team’s defense prevented LaSalle from having a chance of its own at the back of the net. Banks sent back five shots and continued her impressive season in net.
Making history a single time wasn’t enough for the Crimson. Following the Bruno Classic, Harvard was tied for its best start in program history, as the 5-0 team last reached such a record in head coach Ted Minnis’ first season in 2011.
Looking to remain undefeated, the Crimson set its sights on the next weekend of competition at the Bison Invite, hosted by Bucknell University. Making the long road trip to Lewisburg, Penn., Harvard was set to face off against Gannon and Salem Universities on Saturday before preparing for another double-header on the following day.
In its first matchup on Saturday, the Crimson cruised to an 18-5 win, taking down Gannon with the help of a seven-goal run after taking a two-goal lead in the first quarter. The second game wasn’t much different, as the Crimson found itself with a three-goal lead at the end of the first period against Salem and eventually an 11-5 finish, taking down Salem to win its seventh straight game out of the gate. Banks shone once again, recording 21 combined saves on Saturday to go along with three steals and three assists. Hong, in her own right, contributed seven goals on the day.
The second day of the Bison Invite saw Harvard in two rematch games from the Bruno Classic, squaring off against Siena in an early 8 AM start and Wagner shortly after the conclusion of the first game.
Against the Saints, the Crimson found themselves down early, but not for long. An offensive run to respond to Siena’s goal left Harvard with a three-point lead at the end of the first quarter. The game concluded with the Crimson doubling the Saints’ total, 16-8. Harvard had six different members score in the contest.
The rematch against Wagner followed a much closer narrative. Wagner, now ranked No. 18, sought to avenge its loss to the Crimson a week prior. The contest saw a defensive struggle between both sides in the first quarter before the teams began exchanging goals in the second.
By the third quarter, the two squads were tied at nine, with both looking to capitalize on an opportunity. Once again, Harvard’s first-years were crucial in the game’s outcome. Wahl’s late goal in the contest ultimately decided the game, adding to her four other scores on the day.
Banks’ late-game steal sealed the deal, and just like that, the Crimson found itself undefeated through nine games. Banks’ excellent play throughout the weekend earned her Defensive Player of the Week honors from the Collegiate Water Polo Association.
Regardless of the historic start, coach Minnis is looking ahead to continue the success throughout the rest of the season.
“This team has a good mix of older and younger girls and we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our goals,” Minnis said.
Ahead for the Crimson is a change in venue, as the team trains for the Harvard Invite beginning on March 1st. Having such a long break between their most recent match and their next weekend of competition, the team has an opportunity to rest in order to keep its perfect season in tact. However, coming back with the right mindset after such a break is crucial.
“It’s like preseason all over again. It’s about working our butts off, getting into better shape, and having some sort of inter-team competition in order to stay sharp,” Hong said. “Time is going to make us even more excited to play, and I think that’s what’s really great about this break.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past four years, Harvard has finished third in the Ivy League behind Princeton and Penn. This upcoming weekend, the Crimson will return to Lavietes Pavilion for a chance to usurp their Ancient Eight foes when they face the Tigers on Friday and the Quakers on Saturday.
Harvard (11-8, 4-2 Ivy League) is coming off its second consecutive road split, where it fell to Columbia before outlasting Cornell. The Crimson is currently second in the conference standings, with the chance to take over the first spot from Penn with a home sweep this weekend.
Earning that coveted first spot will be no easy feat for the Crimson, however. Penn (15-3, 5-0) is currently undefeated in conference play and have a scoring margin of over 14 points a game. Princeton (11-9, 3-2 Ivy) currently sits one spot below Harvard and has always proven to be a difficult matchup.
After a tough five-game road stint, playing at home will be a welcome sight for the Crimson. Junior guard Katie Benzan acknowledges the advantage that playing at home gives her group.
“We love playing at home,” said Benzan. “It will definitely boost our confidence and our drive to succeed.”
The home crowd should help the Harvard play to its two critical strengths: scoring and rebounding. The Crimson have four different double-digit scorers with Katie Benzan and senior guard Madeline Raster leading the team with 14.3 and 13.7 apiece. The team has also managed to score over 70 points a game against conference opponents.
While their offense is potent with an array of outside shooters, the Tigers and Quakers both boast respectable defenses capable of stifling the Harvard attack. Princeton has allowed 64 points a game while Penn has let up a mere 50. Co-captain Madeline Raster noted the importance of being able to score against Penn’s zone.
“Penn usually plays a tough zone, so we need to play our offense with poise, take advantage of the gaps in their defense, and hit our shots,” Raster said. “We just have to play at our pace and not let the other team’s momentum dictate how we play our game.”
The key to a Crimson victory will be its ability to control the tempo of the game. The team’s best asset is its capacity to score both inside and out. If it can get the offense going early, Harvard can make the Quakers uncomfortable in their vaunted zone defense.
Likewise, Harvard has to control tempo against the Tigers and prevent their scoring attack from getting too comfortable. Princeton scores over 70 points a game and has the ability to go toe to toe with the Crimson offense.
“Princeton has some 3-point shooters and a talented guard-forward, which means we have to know the scout and not allow those players to be comfortable against our defense,” Raster said.
To control the pace effectively on both the offensive and defensive end, Harvard will have to continue to excel at one of its strong suits: rebounding. The Crimson is out-rebounding opponents by over 5.3 boards per game and has one of the best offensive rebounders in the country in Jadyn Bush.
If Bush continues her rate of offensive rebounding, she could potentially finish top-five in the entire nation in this category. Being able to have second chance opportunities off offensive rebounds will be crucial against a team like Penn, whose defense has stymied opponents to shots at a 32.6% clip.
If Harvard can play to its strengths and control the tempo of the game, the team will be in a position to outlast its Ivy League competitors. This weekend’s games can have a significant impact on the conference standings and give the Crimson early momentum against its potential playoff adversaries.
“Both of these games this weekend is important,” Benzan said. “The championship is on the line. We have to come out hungry to sweep this weekend.”
Look for Harvard to try to avenge its semifinal playoff loss from last year and get one step closer to Ancient Eight glory.
