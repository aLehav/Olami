After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is love letter. It’s a love letter to my friends at UCLA, my brothers and sisters in Orlando who I’ll never meet, and to the country of my past, present, and future. Being away from you hurts, and as exciting it is to travel the world, I know that my heart will always lie in the soft Southern California sand or under a light Boston snowfall.
First, to my friends at UCLA. A couple of weeks ago, just a drive away from where we grew up; where we experienced our first loves and our first heartbreaks, an armed gunman shot a professor. You were on lockdown, hiding in buildings just meters away from the site of the tragedy. When I woke up in the morning, and read the news and then your Facebook posts about how you were okay, I felt sweet relief because the United States has seen how much worse things could have been. From Manila, I send love.
Next, to my Latinx brothers and sisters in Orlando. Your faces and names cross my screen every morning. They are beautiful and radiate in bright LED. They are the names and faces of cousins and classmates. The queer, Latinx community you created at Pulse reminds me of individuals at Harvard who have made me feel part of something real, something less hostile than certain spaces around me. From Manila, I send love.
Finally, to the country I love. It’s simple—and important—to politicize your events, but today I want to appreciate you, even with your blemishes. You’ve provided me a springboard and you’ve offered my family a life better than the one my parents knew. Although hateful rhetoric pulls at your seams, your resilience makes you a home. In your darkest moments, the dream you promise shines through. From Manila, I send love.
The optimism that people’s goodness outweighs the hate they carry in their hearts is what keeps me moving and writing. In times of sorrow, op-eds, filibusters, and trauma, love cannot be ignored. The way you love your neighbors, friends, and strangers begs to be amplified, now more than ever. Remember the tender moments, and create more with everyone you encounter. For every hateful act, there will be a thousand good ones as long as we continue sending love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Thursday, June 16, at 9:29 a.m. 
Rich cigar smoke, quaint fishing trips, and a love of strong scotch are trademarks of Samuel M. Fisher ’15 that friends and family members fondly remember.  Fisher—former president of Hillel and Goldman Sachs analyst—passed away last weekend of an unexpected heart complication after he completed a triathlon race in Stamford, Conn. He was 24.
Known as a vivacious person, an inspirational leader and a family-oriented brother, Fisher was naturally kind and welcoming.
“Every now and then, when you take a step back, you realize that he never stopped—he really was always doing things for those around him,” Jacob R. Drucker ’15, a former Crimson editorial editor and classmate of Fisher’s, wrote in an email. “I think the prevailing sentiment has always been that things were just better when Sammy Fisher’s around. He didn’t give you a choice—he just made things better.”
David F. Sackstein ’14, one of Fisher’s closest friends and mentors at the College, and his “big brother” in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, said that he remembers frequenting the iHop on Eliot street late at night, where the two would buy meals for homeless people and those who they thought needed a friend.
Fisher’s friends from Hillel remember him vividly as one of the first people they encountered on campus. Edyt J. Dickstein ’17, current president of Hillel, said when she was a freshman, she couldn’t help but comment on the “smile lines” that nature to Fisher’s face.  She said his welcoming presence drew her to the organization and inspired her to take an active leadership role.
“Sam was in many ways the first friendly face at Hillel,” Dickstein said. “A lot of what I’ve tried to do since then was follow in his footsteps.”
According to Getzel Davis, a rabbi at Hillel, many current and former members of Hillel came to the organization because of Fisher’s effervescent presence and personal outreach efforts.
“He bridged a lot of gaps between the Hillel community as someone who could be involved with the different groups within the organization, and I think that’s a part of his legacy,” Elena F. Hoffenberg ’16 said.
During his time at the College, Fisher not only worked tirelessly at Hillel, but practiced music in a self-titled jazz band comprised of himself and whatever friends he could find for an event. Though the band members might have been fluid, the venue often was not: Hillel served largely as the stage for Fisher’s public performances.  Fisher, though a classically trained pianist and cellist, often played an acoustic bass guitar at these performances.
Fisher’s friends remember his humor — “corny,” at times, Drucker said, but charming nonetheless. Though funny, Fisher’s older brother Jonathan M. Fisher, a student at Harvard Medical School, stressed that Samuel held a gravitas and wisdom beyond his years.
“I felt like even though I was the older brother by a year and a few months, he always felt like the older brother to me, because I felt like I was always learning things from him,” Jonathan Fisher said.
At his core, Fisher was a family man.  Nearly every summer, Fisher and his three brothers and father congregated at Nickerson State Park in Cape Cod, Mass. for a camping trip.
“The fishing was so important,” Jonathan Fisher said. “That was like a big part of—sort of the meat with my relationship with Samuel. ”
Fisher’s family-oriented mindset was a large factor in his decision to attend Harvard, even though the choice was difficult because his older brother attended Yale.
“He was this close to going to Yale just because I was there, because our relationship meant so much to him,” Jonathan Fisher said. “I think, actually, the main reason why he ended up coming here [Harvard] was because it was close to home, it was close to the rest of the family, and it really didn’t make sense to go to Connecticut when the rest of the family was right here.”
While family was important to Fisher’s identity, his Jewish heritage was just as an integral to him. Before attending Harvard, Fisher took a gap year at Yeshivat Orayta,  a seminary in Jerusalem to study Jewish texts and Jewish law.
At the helm of Hillel, Fisher tried his best to draw in Jewish students from different heritages.
“I think over the years in this community, he really started to relate really well to the diversity that exists here in this community,” Sackstein said. “He sort of dedicated himself at the point to making sure that even if people identified Jewishly in different ways, that he would be part of giving them opportunities to relate to that identity.”
After Harvard, Fisher was accomplished. In the span of the past few weeks, Fisher closed his first transaction at Goldman Sachs, according to colleague and classmate Robert C. Kivell ’15.
“He was a model co-worker, and was ranked at the top of our Analyst class,” Kivell wrote of Fisher. “Sam’s lion-sized personality and heart made him a favorite of everyone in the office.”
Fisher’s supervisor, Gregory P. Lee ’90, said that Fisher’s personality and compassion for his colleagues made him stand out from other new employees.
“He was an incredibly useful, valuable, and creative member of the team,” Lee said. “And maybe more important than that—because everyone who graduates from Harvard, and everyone who works at Goldman Sachs is going to be at a certain high caliber—but what I think really differentiated Sam is how great of a human being he was.”
Fisher’s final weekend was spent competing alongside colleagues from Goldman Sachs at a charity triathlon in Stamford, Conn. The charity that hosted the event—Kids in Crisis—serves kids hailing from backgrounds of domestic violence.
Fisher, who was initially slated to only compete in the swim leg of the race, decided to run as well after a colleague of his expressed anxiety about completing the race alone, Lee said. He collapsed shortly after crossing the finish line.
The Harvard Hillel Society is accepting donations in Fisher’s honor through the giving page on the society’s website.

A previous version of the article incorrectly stated that the fraternity to which Samuel Fisher belonged was Alpha Phi Epsilon. In fact, the name of the fraternity is Alpha Epsilon Pi.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Thursday, June 16, at 10:39 a.m.
Harvard Business School officials dedicated the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center last week, marking the first time in the Business School's history that a building has been named after a woman and a person of Asian-American descent.
Shipping and trading financier James Si-Cheng Chao and his family foundation gave $40 million in 2012 to construct the building in honor of his late wife Ruth Mulan Chu Chao. The Chao family also allocated funds for a scholarship program for students of Chinese heritage who attend the Business School.
Of Chao’s six daughters, four attended the the Business School, making the family the only in HBS’s history to have four daughters attend the school, according to a press release. Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, the oldest daughter of the Chao family, spoke before the ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
“We could not think of a better way to give back to the place that has housed so many members of our family,” Elaine Chao said. “We hope that people will be inspired by the life and spirit of an ordinary yet extraordinary woman.”
University President Drew G. Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 joined Business School Dean Nitin Nohria at the event, along with a slew of notable public figures. Among them were Massachusetts senators Elizabeth Warren—a former Law School professor—and Edward J. Markey, Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is married to the Elaine Chao.
Many reflected on the humble beginnings of the Chao family, which immigrated from China at the height of the political turmoil of the 20th century.
Markey said the Chao family represented the “quintessential immigrant story” and that their story “inspires us because it is an uniquely American experience.” Warren applauded Chao for raising six successful daughters—a feat that she said she was “awestruck” by after experiencing raising one daughter of her own.
The Chao Center will become a hub for the school’s executive education initiatives, which serve more than 10,000 executives each year, according to the center’s website. At the dedication, Markey joked about the melting pot of individuals who attend these courses, pointing to the recent enrollment of actors Channing Tatum and L.L Cool J for a course at the school.
Musing about the origins of the Business School’s now sprawling campus, Faust said that initial architects of the campus wrote that the area had “no natural beauty in topography and tree growth.” She said that the building would now stand as a “great beauty for Harvard, natural and human made alike.”

A previous version of this article stated that the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center was the first building named after a woman in Harvard's history. In fact, there have been other buildings at Harvard named for women, such as Maxwell Dworkin. The Chao Center is instead the first building in the history of HBS that has been named after a woman.

Earlier this year, we reported that Greenhouse Cafe—literally one of the last viable food options on campus after Panera, Au Bon Pain, b.good et al decided to end their long relationship with Harvard students and pursue “other” interests—was closing down after commencement.
Cue the waterworks. Of course we were DEVASTATED.
But dry your tears because we here at Flyby just found out that the Cafe will be coming back. That’s right, you’ll have someplace to grab a decent pizza slice and an iced chai latte on your way to your LS1b lecture again. There’s just one catch: it’s not coming back for a while.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven shot us an email letting us know that Harvard is “anticipating re-opening the Library, as well as the Cafe, in 2017.”
We lowkey only care about the cafe, but I bet the daily inhabitants of the Science Center will be happy to know that Cabot’s study space will be back soon—and apparently looking pretty dope. Have you seen the design plans for the new center? Talk about a step into the future.
