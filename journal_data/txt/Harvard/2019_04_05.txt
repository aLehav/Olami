After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From director David Sandberg, whose feature filmography consists solely of horror movies (“Lights Out” and “Annabelle: Creation”), comes an unlikely bundle of superhero joy. "Shazam!" marks a clear change of tone for the D.C. Extended Universe (DCEU), which came into existence with gritty, colorless films like Zack Snyder’s “Batman V. Superman.” With a charismatic lead actor in Zachary Levi, a springy, lighthearted tone, and a solid emotional arc, this film is exactly what the DCEU needs.
The story unfolds in Philadelphia, centering on the experiences of foster child Billy Batson (Asher Angel) as he settles into his 24th foster home. He befriends his foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), a physically disabled superhero fan, who is frequently singled out and bullied at school. In one instance, Billy stands up for Freddy, but tries to escape when he gets outnumbered, jumping on a train: Here, his journey takes a sudden turn towards the supernatural. The train transports Billy to a prehistoric lair where he is confronted by the ancient wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou), who selects Billy as his champion to protect the world against the demons called the "Seven Deadly Sins.” Billy takes up the wizard's mantle by saying "Shazam!" and is magically transformed into an adult superhero, Shazam, played by Levi.
The premise behind Shazam, his appearance, and powers stay relatively faithful to the DC comics from which he originates: He shoots lightning bolts from his fingers, possesses superhuman strength, and wields the power of flight. Ironically, DC initially named "Shazam" as “Captain Marvel,” a name that Marvel eventually gave to an entirely different character — Captain Marvel — who just last month just last month made her feature film debut.
“Shazam!” is at its best when it focuses on Billy's journey as he learns to control his superhero alter-ego. This phase in the film is played for multiple laughs: Some memorable scenes include a face-off in a convenience store between Shazam and armed robbers and the montages where Freddy helps Billy test his newfound abilities. After a while, though, some of the comedic moments begin to feel formulaic. In some instances, one could guess exactly what happens next from the way earlier jokes were set up. However, these predictable moments are few and far between, and they don't take much away from the utter hilarity of Levi's performance. While the concept of playing a 14-year-old trapped in a superhero body sounds silly, Levi really pulls it off. "Shazam!" soars when it does because of Levi's genuine energy: He bounces with excitement when he discovers new powers, is awestruck when he defies the odds, and otherwise brings a boyish charm to the role.
Mark Strong plays the villainous Dr. Thaddeus Silvana, but his serious character feels out of place in a film that’s intrinsically self-aware of what it’s trying to be — a fast-paced superhero comedy. A one-note, off-the-assembly-line style villain, Silvana isn't much to write home about. Aside from partaking in one particularly gory scene, he doesn't comes across as particularly fearsome either. Sandberg establishes his paper-thin backstory early on in the film, making his motivations seem flimsy and inconsequential. In result, moments he has on screen drag the film's pace far more than they provide tension in the plot.
Moreover, some visual effects don't look as polished as one might expect from a tentpole superhero film. In particular, some of Silvana’s sidekicks look like poorly rendered adaptations of "Zuul" from “Ghostbusters.” But for the most part, these computer graphics aren't too distracting; when Levi is flying high above the city, cracking jokes, shooting lightning bolts, and taking the audience on a joyous ride, it's easy to forgive shortcomings in the visual department.
“Shazam!” works so well because of the way its emotional core can stand on its own. The overarching theme of the film is the search for belonging: Billy has been searching for that feeling ever since he was separated from his mom at a carnival when he was little, Freddy is alienated by his classmates at school, and even Silvana is driven to some extent by this need for belonging. The emotional payoffs build off these character arcs and work well, in part due to how effectively the foster family has been cast: The parents (played by Cooper Andrews and Marta Milans) are warm and comforting and the other foster children are cheerful (if slightly forgettable) additions. With its solid narrative structure, "Shazam!" rejuvenates the magic and wonder in the often cliched superhero genre.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week is the annual Israeli Apartheid Week run by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee. For the past few years, we have watched it with dismay. We have seen the annual disregard for veracity and truth. We have observed the destruction of dialogue and the harm wrought on the cause of peace. We have eyed the contempt shown to Jewish history and narratives.
And we will not remain silent any longer.
Combined, we have spent years living and working in Israel. We have volunteered for non-profits, interned in the Knesset, and worked for universities. We are proud liberal Zionists, believers that the quest for a Jewish homeland is only complete with a Palestinian state alongside it. And we are confident that our fellow Harvard students will believe in and support that quest too.
Yet, the entire premise of this week is factually incorrect. Israel, quite simply, is nothing like apartheid South Africa.
Within Israel’s 1948 borders, Arab citizens make up more than 20 percent of the citizenry. Like in other democracies, Israeli law guarantees equal individual rights for all, but minorities are subjected to discrimination not dissimilar to that in the United States. Indeed, Arab Israelis serve in the Knesset, the military — although most are not conscripted — and on the Supreme Court, and they even receive funding for religious institutions. Encouragingly, more Arab Israelis have positive views of the Israeli presidency, police, and military than hold negative ones. They approve of the Knesset at almost double the rate Americans do of Congress.
In apartheid South Africa, people of color largely could not form multiracial parties, possess full voting rights, live in the same areas, or even have interracial sex. Equating this with Israel is simply delusional.
If the organizers of Israeli Apartheid Week wish to distinguish between Israel proper and the West Bank, where Palestinians live under military occupation, they do not do so publicly. Israel captured the West Bank during defensive maneuvers in the Six-Day War, and the situation there is a military occupation. It must end. That is why we are so supportive of the 2000 and 2008 peace proposals made by Israeli prime ministers to Palestinian leadership.
Those were full two-state solutions, with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem and sovereignty in Gaza and the West Bank. They were met only with rejection. This so enraged former U.S. President Bill Clinton that he banged his fist on the table and yelled: “You are leading your people and the region to a catastrophe.”
Palestinian pain at the hands of Israeli policies — from the Nakba to the present — is real and legitimate. And understanding the history and narratives of both sides is critical. There are two peoples, and a solution demands recognizing that no peaceful future will arise through one alone.
We have worked at Harvard for years to foster this mutual understanding. We have supported progressive pro-Israel movements, helped bring to Harvard a diverse range of speakers — including Breaking the Silence, an activist group dedicated to exposing the mistreatment of Palestinians by the Israeli military — and led and backed respectively the creation of the Coalition at Harvard for Israel and Palestine, a group affiliated with J Street, a left-wing Israel advocacy organization. The cause of peace requires this mutual understanding.
But this cause of peace is harmed by PSC’s hosting of speakers like Omar Barghouti, who founded the campaign to boycott Israel. He has frequently endorsed violent resistance, including explicitly against Israeli civilians. He has said that ending the occupation will not end the boycott movement and that he opposes a Jewish state “in any shape or form.” He even explicitly traces the boycott movement not to the occupation, not to the founding of Israel, but before either, to the presence of Jews anywhere in Israel. And we will not remain silent in the face of such destructive rhetoric.
His movement is used gleefully by anti-Semites around the world to cloak their hatred. Perhaps that is why, at a PSC event this week, a participant felt comfortable ranting about the “so-called Jews” and the “myth of the Holocaust.” When the organizers finally responded, at the end of the event, they did so only by condemning “all forms of oppression” and mentioned anti-Semitism only to compare its denunciation to that deserved by Israel.
The cause of peace is further wounded by speakers like Marc Lamont Hill, who called at the UN for “a free Palestine from the river to the sea.” This exclamation, chanted again at a PSC event this week, is not a call for peace, justice, or democracy. By encompassing the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, it makes no distinction between settlements, occupied territories, and cities that have been Jewish for thousands of years. It advocates the eradication of any Jewish sovereignty in the historic Jewish homeland.
The cause of peace requires recognizing the Jewish narrative. It demands understanding that Israel is not an abstract idea but a real refuge. Seventy years ago, this importance became clear. Almost one million Jews then had a thriving culture in Arab nations, including Egypt, Algeria, and Yemen. Those countries today have just a handful left.
Arab countries robbed, expelled, and murdered their Jews. This is not new. But for the first time in two thousand years, Jews facing destruction could not be annihilated. This time, they had a homeland to which they could flee. Today, they and their descendants comprise the majority of the Jewish Israeli population. And we will not remain silent as this history of persecution is ignored.
This history cannot be forgotten. It is why in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, the founders of Israel declared that the country “will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.” They knew that a Jewish homeland is not complete until all are equal.
It is a vision that is far from fulfilled. Next week, when Israelis vote in the Middle East’s only free elections, they will hopefully bring it closer to fruition. We hope that the Harvard community, by recognizing the problems with apartheid week and the need for mutual understanding, will do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Michael Cappucci — a senior vice president at the Harvard Management Company — asked on social media why colleges did not auction off some proportion of acceptance offers as a more transparent alternative to “a system where wealthy parents have to make shady payments.” These comments, published on Cappucci’s public Linkedin page, come in the midst of the nationwide admissions scandal that has sparked broader conversations about inequities in college admissions. Though this scandal has not affected Harvard as of publication, the University has announced plans to open an investigation into a separate scandal involving the head fencing coach. The investigation comes as a response to his alleged involvement in suspicious real estate and non-profit transactions with the family of current and former team students.
It’s important to note that the comments made by Cappucci, which have since been deleted, were posted on his personal social media page; we fully recognize the distinction between Cappucci’s personal views and those of the HMC. However they remain disturbing in that they shed light on how a middle manager of Harvard’s $39.2 billion endowment perceives the role of merit in admissions.
The fact that Cappucci would suggest such an idea only serves to show how deeply entrenched the systems that exist to help wealthy families subvert the standard application process have become. While the financial health of the University is important, we believe that Harvard must first and foremost commit itself to championing merit as the grounds for admission — a commitment which Cappucci’s proposal directly contravenes. Cappucci’s suggestion that the University further institutionalize wealthy students’ privileges seems to view wealth’s role in college admissions process as intractable, and that a fair admissions system is beyond our grasp. We do not agree with this assessment.
There are concrete steps the University can take to minimize the influence socioeconomic status has on a student’s chance of admission. We have previously opined in favor of abolishing the preference given to legacy students and the children of wealthy donors in the College’s admissions process. This would mark concrete progress towards ensuring that students from advantaged backgrounds do not receive an additional boost from preferential treatment in admissions deliberations.
Even if the University does not believe the proposals outlined above or others like them are feasible, it cannot abandon the search for a fair and financially viable admissions system. The ideological foundations of an educational institution demand that Harvard not give up on the ideal of pursuing merit in admissions simply because an obvious solution has not yet presented itself.
As a research institution, Harvard has established itself as a perennial champion of inquiry and intellectual exploration. If convinced that there is no financially workable model for achieving equity in college admissions right now, Harvard should work to find one, rather than dismiss the ideals of merit-based admissions. It is with this spirit that Harvard teaches its students to approach the problems we find in our studies, and it is this spirit that Harvard must embody in striving to better live up to its own ideals.
In its current admissions practices, we reiterate our praise of Harvard for making a good-faith effort to recognize that an applicant’s merit manifests itself is shaped by opportunity. We also support Harvard’s pursuit of need-blind and race-conscious admissions policies. But these policies, while laudable, constitute only valuable first steps on the path towards true realization of the merit ideal. There remains much work to be done.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2007, I went to a protest against the Iraq War with my family. Unbeknownst to us, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was using the protest to test new technologies: Small, surveilling “insect-drones” disguised as dragonflies flew over our slogans and signs.
Since the Cold War and, more earnestly, since 9/11, the U.S. government has funneled billions into developing such technologies: Defense and security research comprise over 48 percent of the overall U.S. Research and Development budget — the Department of Defense holds the largest share of such funding by a wide margin. The impact of this funding is clear: It underlies the sordid history of the 21st century’s well-documented travesties in Iraq and Afghanistan, and others less-documented across the world.
But all this money — $57.7 billion just this year — was not spent concocting technologies of war in secret government labs. Instead, it was distributed to universities, deputizing them and their researchers to generate much-needed technologies — needed, that is, for military priorities. From scientists funded for artificial intelligence research and weapons development to anthropologists analyzing culture for “better killing,” the 21st century has seen a resurgence of government — and specifically military — control over university research agendas.
This concern is not new; universities’ relationships with institutional power have increasingly deepened since the Cold War. At Harvard, next week marks 50 years since the 1969 University Hall occupation, during which — in protest of the Vietnam War — “liberated documents” highlighted administrative and faculty collaboration on U.S. military and intelligence projects. In fact, this collaboration across American universities was the very reason for the development of many disciplines’ ethical guidelines in the 1970s. But as defense spending has increased in the last 18 years, even these guidelines have been loosened in pursuit of government funds (also symptomatic of increasing corporatization of universities).
Harvard is by no means unique in these collaborations. While our primary culprits are the Harvard Kennedy School’s national security programs and STEM research in collaboration with military research agencies (placing us in the top 100 most militarized schools in the country), schools nationwide participate in research funded by programs like DARPA pursuing U.S. military interests. Consider the Pat Robertson Intelligence Scholars Program, for example, which (like others) funds graduate and undergraduate study in return for undisclosed funding and mandatory military or intelligence conscription. Or Intelligence Community Centers for Academic Excellence, funding university recruitment of minority students for intelligence careers beginning in middle school, and aiming, as its proponents describe, to recruit “spies that look like their targets.” These programs belie a national security infrastructure that defines academic priorities across disciplines and across the country, regardless of their transparency, moral-ethical value, or alignment with the pursuit of justice.
This power, of course, is not only monetary. We all watched as Chelsea Manning’s Institute Of Politics fellowship was revoked at then-CIA director Mike Pompeo's behest. Meanwhile, this school and others grant platforms to not only orchestrators of 21st-century U.S. military operations, but also war criminals and architects of destructive policies. We continue hosting ROTC programs — not an affinity group but the military itself — on campus despite the U.S. military’s devastating and often illegal combat operations (and despite its predatory and discriminatory practices). In turn, these phenomena feed the revolving doors between government and the private sector and between the private sector and educational institutions, leading to what Henry A. Giroux calls the “military-industrial-academic complex” consuming modern universities.
***
In my first column, I identified how the modern university’s imbrication in power often renders it incompatible with the creative, transgressive projects needed to construct better worlds. The militarization of universities is central to this problem: When research goals are defined by pursuit of military domination (or, analogously, corporate power) rather than honest engagement with questions of justice, we preclude the realization of even the most modest university goals.
Globally, this is a common concern. While some contend that the military is flawed but perfectible, the fact is that modern states depend on the ability to suspend laws in national crises — that is, to dismiss legal, moral, or ethical guidelines to preserve their power. In the U.S., this has meant erosion of judicial oversight over executive power; post-9/11, U.S. courts have given the executive branch (and military) almost-free rein on the very issues government-funded university research advances today. Universities cannot — and should not — trust that government projects are in pursuit of justice or liberation. To do so is to turn a blind eye to history, to undermine the values we claim to stand for, and to impede rather than facilitate the transformation we need.
This, of course, requires a radical re-evaluation of university politics. It requires considering alternative endowment practices that prioritize academic independence. It demands analysis that moves beyond liberal lip-service into recognition and refusal of complicity in global domination, even in the purportedly leftist academy. And it requires courageous engagement — through scholarship and direct action — with deeply rooted structures of racism, militarism, colonialism, and capitalism that make possible the militarization of universities and the entrenchment of power it sustains.
From National Mall to Boylston Hall, we must find the courage to challenge the state even when most unpopular, and pursue both scholarship and politics of justice independent of state agendas. That may not mean total disengagement, but it does mean terms of engagement that truly subordinate research to moral-ethical values of justice.
Universities are not the state, and they are not the military. That is for good reason. The military-industrial-academic complex blurs these lines, embedding the university in the very logics of domination that its scholarship claims to address. Far from expanding political possibilities, this leaves us with a destructive status quo — and with universities that preclude, rather than generate, the resources we need to change it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is investigating the University’s head fencing coach after he allegedly engaged in real estate and non-profit transactions involving the family of current and former students on the team, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to FAS affiliates Thursday.
Peter Brand, Harvard’s head men and women’s fencing coach, sold his Needham, Mass. house to iTalk Global Communications, Inc. co-founder Jie Zhao in 2016 for hundreds of thousands of dollars above its valuation, the Boston Globe reported Thursday. Zhao’s younger son, a sophomore, was admitted to Harvard shortly after and is currently a member of the fencing team. His older son, who was also a member of the fencing team, graduated from Harvard in 2018.
Harvard was notified of the allegations against Brand on Monday, according to Gay’s email. The University has since opened an “independent review.”
Zhao told the Globe he decided to buy Brand’s house after he heard Brand complain about his long commute to campus. He denied that Brand sought him out for the purchase, calling it a “good investment.” Zhao never lived in the house, and he sold it at a loss of more than $300,000 just 17 months after first purchasing it.
One week after Zhao purchased Brand’s Needham residence, Brand and his wife allegedly paid $1.3 million for a Cambridge home, roughly $300,000 above its asking price.
Zhao and Brand did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Gay’s announcement about the independent investigation comes in the wake of a nationwide admissions scandal in which 50 people have been charged for participating in a scheme involving bribing university officials and falsifying test scores to earn the children of wealthy entrepreneurs and celebrities entrance to top universities. Harvard was not one of the universities implicated.
Gay wrote in her email that it is the University’s “current understanding” that the allegations against Brand are not related to the scandal and that Harvard has admissions protocols meant to safeguard the process from interference. She noted that all athletes must be interviewed and approved by the College’s roughly 40-person admissions committee.
Zhao and Brand are also tenuously connected through a separate set of non-profit financial transactions that took place around the time his older son, who was also on the fencing team, was admitted to the College. Zhao told the Globe he donated $1 million to the National Fencing Foundation of Washington D.C. in 2013, the largest donation by far that the foundation had ever received. That same year, Brand and his wife formed a non-profit foundation in Delaware which received $100,000 from the National Fencing Foundation.
Zhao’s older son said in an interview with The Crimson that he was unaware of the donations until this week and has not heard from the University or outside counsel about the investigation. He pointed out that he was admitted to the College through the Early Action program in December 2013, months before he says his father’s donation “went through.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “committed” to upholding the “integrity of our recruitment practices.”
Brand could have violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules with the acceptance of that donation, depending on how he used it and whether he took the requisite steps to record the contribution, according to Rick Allen, founder of Informed Athlete, which helps prospective college athletes navigate NCAA rules.
“There’s potential there that that could end up being a violation of the rules regarding coaches reporting and accepting outside income if he personally benefited from that money,” he said in an interview with The Crimson. “It would have to depend on whether the money was reported and how it was utilized.”
Though Allen said Zhao’s purchase of the house would likely not constitute an NCAA violation, Zhao’s decision to buy plane tickets for multiple members of the fencing team could run afoul of regulations around “impermissible benefits.”
Allen cautioned, though, that it likely depended on whether the other students on the flights were longtime friends of Zhao’s sons and if the trips were for competition or purely for leisure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Posters calling on Harvard Law School to publicly release the findings of a student mental health survey conducted in 2017 were plastered across campus last weekend as prospective Law School students visited campus for an admitted students weekend.
Harvard University Health Services distributed the survey to Law School students in November 2017 as part of a broader administrative effort across the University to address mental health issues on campus. The Law School has yet to release the full findings, but administrators presented a portion of the results at a public event in March 2018 and previous members of the Law School's student government wrote an op-ed on the results.
The posters, addressed to prospective students, accused administrators of refusing to release the entire survey because of their reluctance to address mental health concerns on campus.
“The administration is refusing to release — and actively covering up — data from this mental health survey, in part because they are trying to escape responsibility for their failing mental health support systems,” the posters read. “The student body and the broader public deserve to know how bad things are, and we must know to be part of any real conversation about change.”
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that the claims accusing the Law School of intentionally hiding the full results out of fear of public perceptions have no basis.
“The suggestion that the Law School is withholding information to protect its reputation or to wait students out is ridiculous and offensive,” Sells wrote. “The well-being of our students is an important issue that we take very seriously, and we are committed to creating substantive solutions and support mechanisms for all of our students.”
Mary C. Rockett, a Law School student involved in the production and distribution of the posters, said she decided to take direct action after numerous conversations with Sells where Rockett said the dean declined to release the full results.
“We tried to do this activism because we're not getting any response from the administration through traditional kind of meetings and follow up calls,” Rockett said.
“This process has been going on for a year. It is not really about showing up the administration, but putting these issues back into the conversation,” she added. “This is one of the only ways we really have at this point.”
Rockett she Sells told her that one of the reasons the Univerity refused to fully release the survey is that the administration is worried about student reaction to the results.
Sells wrote that in addition to presenting the abridged survey findings during a public forum, the administration has taken other steps to improve student well-being on campus. These initiatives include establishing a working group comprising students, faculty, administrators, and mental health professionals to evaluate mental health issues at the school. The Law School has also coordinated with HUHS.
“HLS is working in partnership with [HUHS Director Paul J.] Barreira and HUHS to understand the data and to consider what additional support services may be needed,” Sells wrote.
Sells added that the Law School’s results were consistent with findings at other Harvard graduate schools.
“While the survey results are in line with those seen among students in other professions and graduate programs, we are taking them seriously and they are an important indicator that all of us – in graduate programs and in the legal profession – must continue to work on this important issue,” Sells wrote.
Correction: April 23, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mary Rockett believes Law School administrators are worried about how students would react to the survey results if they were fully released. In fact, Rockett said Marcia Sells expressed this concern to her in a conversation between the two.

Harvard Medical School convened a student financial aid subcommittee last semester to incorporate student voices into financial aid policy decisions.
The subcommittee was created to bring student voices into the fold as administrators consider ways to address student debt concerns surrounding higher education, according to Sarah Carey, associate director of financial aid at the Medical School. Four student representatives sit on the subcommittee after complete an annual application process coordinated by the student council. Applicants must also meet with the director of financial aid when being considered.
“The Financial Aid Committee has long included students among its membership. This fall we convened a student subcommittee to further strengthen our partnership with students,” Carey wrote in an emailed statement. “They are volunteers who join us in working toward a shared goal of reducing student debt.”
Keizra S. Mecklai, a Medical School student on the subcommittee, said the group provides students with an opportunity to speak directly with administrators about ideas that either haven’t been tried before or “deserve to be further investigated.” The subcommittee also allows students to make more substantial contributions to larger committee meetings, she said.
“We meet the month before the full financial aid committee meeting to further investigate an idea,” Mecklai said. “That would actually allow us to have agenda time on the financial aid committee’s agenda, so that we could present the idea. It’s basically just an infrastructural way to make sure that student ideas are being heard.”
Nicholos P. Joseph, president of the Medical School student council, said the formation of this subcommittee was one of his goals coming into his term.
“I came in this year with a vision to really foster community and to incorporate student voices into financial aid,” he said. “I think one big thing is that Harvard, in general, really values its diversity. That’s one of the cornerstones of it’s admissions policies, so we have been trying to foster that community through a variety of different ways.”
Harvard’s involvement of student voices in conversations about financial aid and mitigating student debt comes in the wake of New York University Medical School’s decision last summer to eliminate tuition for all MD students. At the same, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daly ’82 informed students that Harvard would not be following suit.
Edward Hundert, Harvard’s dean for medical education, also said at the time that the school makes its financial aid decisions related to need.
“What we're trying to do is make sure that, as we allocate our scholarship funds, that we do it based on the calculated ability to pay of people who apply, so that we don't get into the possibility that a students from a family of considerable means is getting more of our aid relative to a student of more limited means,” he said in September.
Harvard’s newly formed student subcommittee met once in January, but Mecklai said she has already seen the committee’s influence.
“I think the biggest impact right now is establishing a structural way for students to have input on part of the agenda for financial aid committee meetings,” she said. “At the least, we are just offering our opinions on initiatives or agenda items that were offered by the administration and actually being able to have a hand in that.”

Dean of Harvard Business School Nitin Nohria said the school has continued to focus on improving gender diversity in recent years following a 2015 push to address deep-rooted disparities at the school.
Nohria said in recent years the school has created a number of admissions and outreach strategies aimed at attracting and retaining a more diverse student population during an interview Tuesday.
“There's a much more intentional effort to create an educational, as well as a social, experience at Harvard Business School that reflects the diversity of our students,” Nohria said.
He said the school has built its efforts around the goal of ensuring that students from all backgrounds can thrive at the school. One way the school has attempted to do this is by reaching out to newly admitted students and talking to them about the ways the school supports students who might not traditionally see themselves as part of the demographic the school serves.
“Whenever we admit someone, [we] approach that person to make sure that they understand that Harvard Business School would be welcoming of them,” Nohria said.
In recent years, the school has broadened programs like Peek Weekend, which allows students to visit campus and experience the MBA program before applying to the business school. The program, launched in 2015 alongside a series of other gender diversity-focused initiatives, at first only targeted students from traditionally women’s colleges, but has since expanded to include students from other backgrounds and schools as well.
“That's a way to make sure that the funnel of people coming into Harvard Business School is more diverse,” said Nohria.
Once new students arrive on campus, the school has also created a variety of structures and groups to fuel a more inclusive environment. Nohria said that creating specific roles in the business school’s sections — groups of students in each class year that take courses together — has helped teach the value of diversity in the classroom.
“Every section at Harvard Business School now has the students have elected a [Diversity and Inclusion] officer, they have created a [Diversity and Inclusion] council,” said Nohria.
“We meet with that group so that we're trying to work these issues not one group by one group, but even to look across things that are common across all of the underrepresented minority groups at Harvard Business School,” he added.
The school has also put in place programs aimed to increase gender diversity in the business world at large. The Gender Initiative, also launched in 2015, is a three pronged program supporting women business leaders and gender equity through greater faculty engagement with the topic of gender, according to Colleen C. Ammerman, the initiative’s director.
“The school saw a need and an opportunity to create more of a community for that work,” Ammerman said.
One of the Gender Initiative’s aspects is educational opportunities, which include the Women on Boards executive education program. The mid-career program started in 2015 and has seen an increase in enrollment from 60 women in its first year to more than 140 women last year.
Program co-chair and Business School Professor Boris Groysberg said it is meant to put women in a position to move up the corporate ladder and secure seats on corporate boards.
“We take unbelievably great women from around the world and we hope to teach them — during the period of the program — how boards work, what are the stakeholders, what are the functions and responsibilities of the board,” Groysberg said.
Nohria said the school has also worked to ensure that gender diversity efforts don’t end when students graduate. The Business School hosts periodic conferences to bring together female alumni around the world in an effort to bolster their networks.
“We had the Boston Women's Leadership Accelerator — these are women alumnae who have organized a conference where they get together,” Nohria said. “Now we have had one after that in San Francisco, we've now had one in New York, we are thinking of one in London.”
The school plans to use these conferences as a model for creating events supporting underrepresented minority groups as well, according to Nohria.
“People from some of these underrepresented groups at Harvard Business School, even after they graduate from the school, [can] be a resource to each other,” Nohria said. “How can we as a school help them be a resource for each other?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences hosted its second annual “Building Relationships, Increasing Diversity, and Growing Engineers” Week this past week, bringing together students, faculty, staff, and administrators for a series of events highlighting diversity issues in STEM.
BRIDGE Week originated after leaders of three student organizations at SEAS — the Society of Women Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers — collaborated to celebrate a SEAS alumnus who had contributed to engineering and advanced diversity in STEM, according to SEAS Director of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Alexis J. Stokes.
“They decided to do a number of events that celebrated diversity but was also about expanding our knowledge of the best practices of creating this diverse, inclusive, and welcoming environment,” Stokes said.
Sayo R. Eweje ’19, who helped organize the inaugural BRIDGE Week last year as president of Harvard’s chapter of NSBE, said he hoped the event would provide a space for people with diverse backgrounds to come together and discuss approaches to address ongoing diversity issues in STEM.
This year’s BRIDGE Week programming included a summit on gender equity in STEM and an “Out in STEM” panel discussion featuring BGLTQ faculty, researchers, and industry professionals. Guest speakers included Computer Science Professor Edward W. Kohler; President Emeritus of NSBE Boston Chiderah Okoye Nordee; and Nigel Jacob, the co-founder of a civic innovation incubator.
SEAS alumna Michi E. Garrison ’83 received the Harvard SEAS Distinguished Engineer Award at the BRIDGE Banquet held in the Faculty Club Wednesday. In her acceptance speech, she shared her experiences working in the medical device industry after graduating with a degree in Biomechanical Engineering.
Garrison said she thinks gender and racial disparities in engineering stem from an “inherent bias many people have about women and minorities, especially in the technical field.” She urged students to develop professional networks and form personal connections in order to open the door to new opportunities, regardless of the particular career path they chose to pursue.
Andrea S. Rodriguez-Marin Freudmann ’20, president of the Society of Women Engineers, said she thinks it is important for the awardee to be a Harvard graduate.
“If it’s a big struggle for you and you don’t have anybody you feel like you can rely on and you don’t feel like you’re included in the community, then you might be inclined to leave,” she said. “We’re there to try and fix that problem and I think that we thought that showcasing someone who made it — you know, providing role models essentially — would be a great way to encourage people to stick with it.”
Thursday’s BRIDGE Week event showcased a panel discussion on promoting diversity in STEM industry spaces. This event was a part of the “I’ll Make Me a World” speaker series, developed last summer by Electrical Engineering student Winston E. Michalak ’21 in collaboration with History of Science Department Chair Evelynn M. Hammonds.
The panel featured Lydia Villa-Komaroff, founder and principal of consulting firm Intersections SBD; Rubén Lozano-Aguilera, a product manager at Google; Kenneth Armstead, co-founder and principal of BHC Macro Investment Management, LLC; and Anastacia Awad, the associate director and head of emerging talent and leadership at Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research
“The aim of the speaker series is to celebrate the diversity that already exists in STEM by highlighting the accomplishments of the incredible panelists that we’ve invited tonight and the incredible individuals that we’ll invite in the future and that we have invited in the past,” Michalak said.
The conversation, which Hammonds moderated, began with brief remarks from each of the panelists and questions from the moderator, before transitioning into a dialogue between audience members and the panelists.
“For me, STEM and science and technology are about solving problems, but we need to be able to identify what the problems are,” Lozano-Aguilera said. “If we can’t identify those problems, we can’t solve them, and that’s where having a diverse workforce will be able to rectify those problems.”
Several people at the event discussed ways to increase support for diversity-related initiatives in STEM.
“I think what we haven’t done is scale the things that we know work and provide support for people and keep a lot of knowledge out there about what these things do. I think that’s the problem we’ve gotta solve at some point,” Hammonds said.
Michalak said he hopes to broaden the range of panelists invited to speak at future lecture series in order to demonstrate to students, faculty, administration, and staff that “there are people, all sorts of people, working in all sorts of field in STEM.”
“If you are a student or if you are anyone at the College or anyone anywhere, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, there is someone like you working in a STEM-related field,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is investigating the University’s head fencing coach after he allegedly engaged in real estate and non-profit transactions involving the family of current and former students on the team, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to FAS affiliates Thursday.
Peter Brand, Harvard’s head men and women’s fencing coach, sold his Needham, Mass. house to iTalk Global Communications, Inc. co-founder Jie Zhao in 2016 for hundreds of thousands of dollars above its valuation, the Boston Globe reported Thursday. Zhao’s younger son, a sophomore, was admitted to Harvard shortly after and is currently a member of the fencing team. His older son, who was also a member of the fencing team, graduated from Harvard in 2018.
Harvard was notified of the allegations against Brand on Monday, according to Gay’s email. The University has since opened an “independent review.”
Zhao told the Globe he decided to buy Brand’s house after he heard Brand complain about his long commute to campus. He denied that Brand sought him out for the purchase, calling it a “good investment.” Zhao never lived in the house, and he sold it at a loss of over $300,000 just 17 months after first purchasing it.
One week after Zhao purchased Brand’s Needham residence, Brand and his wife allegedly paid $1.3 million for a Cambridge home, roughly $300,000 above its asking price.
Zhao and Brand did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Gay’s announcement comes in the wake of a nationwide admissions scandal in which 50 people have been charged for participating in a scheme involving the bribing of university officials and falsifying of test scores to earn the children of wealthy entrepreneurs and celebrities entrance to top universities. Harvard was not one of the universities implicated.
Gay wrote in her email that it is the University’s “current understanding” that the allegations against Brand are not related to the scandal and that Harvard has admissions protocols meant to safeguard the process from interference. She noted that all athletes must be approved by the College’s roughly 40-person admissions committee and be interviewed.
Zhao and Brand are also tenuously connected through a separate set of non-profit financial transactions that took place around the time his older son, who was also on the fencing team, was admitted to the College. Zhao told the Globe he donated $1 million to the National Fencing Foundation of Washington D.C. in 2013, the largest donation by far that the foundation had ever received. That same year, Brand and his wife formed a non-profit foundation in Delaware which received $100,000 from the National Fencing Foundation.
Zhao’s older son said in an interview with The Crimson that he was unaware of the donations until this week and has not heard from the University or outside counsel about the investigation. He pointed out that he was admitted to the College through the Early Action program in December 2013, months before he says his father’s donation “went through.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “committed” to upholding the “integrity of our recruitment practices.”
Brand could have violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules with the acceptance of that donation, depending on how he used it and whether he took the requisite steps to record the contribution, according to Rick Allen, founder of Informed Athlete, which helps prospective college athletes navigate NCAA rules.
“There’s potential there that that could end up being a violation of the rules regarding coaches reporting and accepting outside income if he personally benefited from that money,” he said in an interview with The Crimson. “It would have to depend on whether the money was reported and how it was utilized.”
Though Allen said Zhao’s purchase of the house would likely not constitute an NCAA violation, Zhao’s decision to buy plane tickets for multiple members of the fencing team could run afoul of regulations around “impermissible benefits.”
Allen cautioned, though, that it likely depended on whether the other students on the flights were longtime friends of Zhao’s sons and if the trips were for competition or purely for leisure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh said she plans on reexamining undergraduate advising, improving professors’ teaching, and reforming courses that “weed” out students in an interview Thursday.
Claybaugh — who assumed her position in July 2018, replacing Jewish Studies Professor Jay M. Harris — is responsible for overseeing the College’s curriculum, the Program in General Education, academic advising, and career services.
Claybaugh said one of her main priorities in the years ahead is to “do more” with academic advising, a request undergraduates have put to her since she took office. In particular, she hopes to pair students with advisers more tailored to their concentrations and focus on identifying common sources of academic stress.
“At the College, we care about the whole student, but each of us has a particular responsibility to a particular part of the student,” Claybaugh said. “I think that what we can do on the academic side is help respond to students’ stress, student anxiety, by helping to address the root causes.”
Claybaugh said she hopes to develop a pedagogical class for faculty members to teach them “best practices” to address the “particular” needs of Harvard students. She said such an instructional program is still in its early stages, but believes that it would be well-received among faculty.
“I think it would send a very clear signal that Harvard expects its faculty to be excellent teachers as well as excellent researchers,” Claybaugh said. “I think that I very seldom meet a faculty member who doesn't care about teaching, but many of us have received no actual training in teaching.”
She noted that many professors simply teach the way they were taught as students, even if that style is not ideal for the material they are now teaching.
“There are many kinds of assignments and many models of course design other than a kind of standard lecture or seminar that faculty just didn't experience themselves,” Claybaugh said. “So I think faculty are very willing. I think it would just be helpful to give them tools.”
Claybaugh also said she wants to work with individual departments to ensure students are not forced out of concentrations because of their ability level.
“I think we are no longer willing to just watch students sink or swim,” she said. “And so that means that we need to really scrutinize where students seem to be falling through the cracks, and figure out how we can work with individual courses, with departments, to ensure that all of our students flourish equally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 30 protestors from two prominent Harvard divestment campaigns interrupted a Harvard Kennedy School event featuring University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long to continue their calls for fossil fuel and prison divestment Thursday evening.
Over the past few months, the two campaigns — Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — have ramped up their demands for the University to divest its nearly $40 billion endowment from companies related to the fossil fuel industry and the United States prison system.
Before the two Harvard administrators — who were slated to discuss how universities can promote economic opportunity — could begin their exchange at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum for the Malcom Wiener Center for Social Policy event, protesters within the crowd stood up from their seats holding signs with slogans like “Demand: Divest!” Six protestors took the stage and sat down in front of Long and Bacow.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf told protestors they could demonstrate but urged them to move to the back of the forum to allow audience members to see Long and Bacow.
“I understand that some of you want to make a point, and you can make that point, but I’m afraid [what] you can’t do is to hinder the ability of other people here to listen to our speakers,” Elmendorf said.
Elmendorf struggled to quiet the protestors for several minutes, until Bacow stood up and gave a terse address.
“First of all, I would like to tell you that Harvard has never had an experience to my knowledge in recent memory where a speaker has not been allowed to speak,” Bacow said. “I hope this will not be the first time that that happens.”
Bacow also told the protestors he would respond to “reason” instead of “pressure,” reiterating comments he made during a meeting with members of the prison divestment campaign last month. He noted that he was “happy” to meet with them again, but for the sake of those in attendance at the discussion, he planned to continue the event.
“You can hold your signs in the back, but we’re all here to have a conversation about higher education,” Bacow said. “You’re not being helpful to your cause and I suspect you’re also not gaining many friends or many allies in the audience by virtue in the way in which you choose to express your point of view.”
After protestors refused to leave the stage, Bacow, along with Long, Elmendorf, and members of the audience, left the forum to congregate in a fourth-floor Kennedy School classroom to continue their conversation.
Once Bacow had left the room, divestment protestors remained chanting “Who shut it down? We shut it down. If we don’t get it, shut it down.”
Law School student Joanna C. Anyanwu, a member of HPDC, said after the protest that the activists had succeeded in garnering the desired response from administrators.
“I mean they were obviously upset,” Anyanwu said. “And I guess I didn’t expect them to be as visibly livid. But it’s clear that we got under their skin, which is good.”
Still, Anyanwu said her group was “open to more dialogue” with Bacow.
"He has our information and if he ever wants to talk to us, he’s free to do so,” she said.
After relocating, Bacow and Long continued their conversation without further disruptions.
In an interview with The Crimson following the event, Bacow addressed his frustrations with the protestors.
“If they believe this is the way to persuade people of the rightness of their cause, they’re grossly mistaken,” Bacow said.
Bacow also referenced his “multiple” meetings with students about divestment, a trend he said he is now hesitant to continue.
“Their behavior tonight does not encourage me to meet with them again,” Bacow said. “As I said, I respond to reason, not to pressure, and what we saw tonight was not reason.”
While Harvard is not a stranger to divestment movements on its campus, the two groups have escalated their efforts in recent months. Both fossil fuel and prison divestment advocates have marched through Harvard Yard, released petitions that have garnered wide-support from Harvard affiliates, and met with Bacow himself. Prison divestment advocates also displayed a banner condemning Harvard’s investments in prison-related companies during a Tuesday gender equity summer where Bacow was speaking.
Thursday’s protest, however, marks the first time the groups have come together to demonstrate for their causes.
In addition to Thursday evening’s encounter, Bacow’s chief of staff, Patricia Bellinger, wrote an email Wednesday to fossil fuel divestment advocates declining their request that he attend a public forum to discuss Harvard’s holdings of fossil fuel-related assets. His decline comes on the heels of a Tuesday Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting in which Bacow said he would look into hosting in a forum with professors about the subject.
Ilana A. Cohen ’22, a member of Divest Harvard, said an open dialogue between students and administrators on divestment is vital to upholding the University’s position as a “responsible institutional actor.”
“We think it's essential that the administration is actually willing to engage with us in a dialogue,” Cohen said. “It's very different to simply put out positions, or make points in articles to The Crimson than it is to actually engage your students in conversation around an issue that is so pertinent.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the call for a student forum, referring to Bellinger’s email.
Correction: April 7, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the event as being hosted by the Institute of Politics. In fact, it was a Harvard Kennedy School's Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy event.

Forty-eight hours before the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences' first week of classes began, new Ph.D. student and active military member Timothy R. Bauler welcomed his first child at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Two days later, Bauler rode the train from MGH to Harvard Square, wandered around campus, entered multiple wrong buildings, and finally walked into his first class at GSAS — with spit up on his shirt.
But the trials of being both a graduate student and a parent often go much further beyond spit up-caused embarrassment.
In any given year, more than one in twenty graduate students in GSAS are also parents. Some are single parents, some are married to other Ph.D. students, and others have one, two, or three or more children. But they all face similar issues, ranging from healthcare and childcare costs to the social isolation that comes with being a student-parent.
As recently as 1995, Harvard had no significant financial or social policies in place specifically addressing the challenges student-parents face. Resources for student-parents were limited to daycare services, and the University was just starting to talk about maternity and paternity leaves, according to self-proclaimed scholar of GSAS student-parenthood Blakely B. O’Connor.
“You had your children and you just did it by yourself. There was nothing. You didn't expect that the graduate school was going to help you,” said Dean of Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana — a GSAS student-parent himself during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The lack of assistance prompted McCavana to create new student-parenthood policies and assistance at GSAS when he became dean of student affairs in 1995.
In 2012, GSAS started the Parental Accommodation and Financial Support program — what McCavana calls his defining success — a $6,516 gift to student-parents upon giving birth to or adopting a child to be used at the parent’s own discretion. Student-parents also receive a 12-week paid parental leave, dubbed a “parental accommodation,” along with the grant. McCavana said he hopes to extend the leave to a full semester in coming years.
Assistant Director of Student Services Jackie Yun said the goal of the program was to give recipients autonomy in choosing how to spend the funds.
“The idea is to let individuals have agency and let them make decisions for themselves that will best serve them,” Yun said.
But many student-parents still face issues every day — from spending much of their graduate stipend on healthcare costs to experiencing social isolation and stress. For many student-parents, parenthood is at once the most fulfilling and terrifying aspect of their lives.
On finding out she was pregnant during her first year at GSAS, O’Connor, who is a co-chair of Student-Parents Organization, said, “I was terrified. Absolutely terrified.”
“And it was really hard. It was not something that my husband and I had planned to do year one of my Ph.D. at Harvard — start a family. But we did. We did.”
Student-parent and international student Angélica Marquez Osuna put it bluntly: Parental Accommodation and Financial Support “was inadequate.” Even though it paid for one year of health insurance for her child, she wasn’t sure how she would afford insurance the next year.
Graduate students receive a stipend of approximately $36,000 before taxes, and many teach classes once they are eligible to earn more money. International students, however, are restricted in how much they can work — leaving some hard-pressed to support families.
As Osuna prepared for her general exams, she searched for a way to renew her child’s health insurance, which she said she found to be “almost impossible” to pay for. Unable to bear the financial burden, she sought advice from a Harvard financial adviser, who repeatedly told her loans would be the best option.
“I felt so sad when I was asking for money,” she said. “Then, with the support of my advisor, my mind changed.”
All eight student-parents interviewed said their professors and advisers have been the most helpful resource they’ve found at Harvard after becoming a parent. With the help of her adviser and Yun, Osuna abandoned the Harvard insurance plan and instead enrolled in Massachusetts State Health Connector, which on average decreases the cost of child health insurance by $1,500. In comparison, Harvard’s insurance plan costs $2,000 on average per semester.
GSAS administrators have said PAFS can serve as a resource for student-parents needing funding for health insurance or other costs associated with having a child.
“Supporting student parents is an important goal for GSAS and we work with individual students and with student leaders to assist and develop new programming,” wrote GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall.
Erin E. Williams, student-parent and active member of the military, receives healthcare and subsidized child care from her military benefits. She said she frequently sees other parents reduce their personal coverage to save money.
“But you don't want to do that to your kids,” Williams said. “They're too valuable to you. So that's where it becomes hard.”
SPO Co-Chair David A. Romney said he shared Osuna’s disappointment with the University’s lack of assistance with healthcare after parents use up PAFS funds. Romney and his wife took on debt to assist covering the cost of health insurance for their two children before his wife started working.
“Paying for my wife's insurance and for insurance for the two kids was, you know, $10,000 to $15,000 a year, which is...close to half of your stipend,” Romney said. “There's not a lot left after that.”
The financial burdens student-parents face extend well beyond just healthcare costs.
Though some student-parents are able to have their partner’s insurance plans cover their children, all must pay for child care. Each of the eight student-parents interviewed said child care in Boston costs between $2,000 and $2,500 per month.
“I know that child care often costs more than rent,” O’Connor said. “Boston is already one of the most expensive cities to live in, so if your child care is even one half times your rent, it makes it very difficult to manage your budget.”
Student-parent Kelsey Hanson-Woodruff called child care costs the “biggest issue” she has faced as a student.
“I’m paying more for child care than I get paid in my stipend,” Hanson-Woodruff said.
Harvard owns six child care facilities across campus. Many students said they opt for Boston-based centers instead because they are cheaper and closer to where they live.
Daycare aside, even the cost of single-night care or the use of baby sitters can get expensive. Romney said he regularly spends anywhere from $19-$22 an hour for child supervision.
GSAS recently started subsidizing online child care service “Care.com” for graduate students. Though several student-parents said they have found the program useful, they said it often serves more as an emergency resource because the school will only subsidize ten uses of the website per semester.
In contrast, Cornell’s Student Child-Care Grant Program allows student-parent families with an annual income of less than $120,000 to apply each year for $12,000 childcare grants, $1,000 of additional awards, and employment for a non-student unemployed spouse, according to Assistant Dean of Graduate Life at Cornell Janna S. Lamey.
While the Cornell grant program is application-based, Harvard provides funding and paid leave to all students who request a PAFS grant, according to Hall.
In 2018 the SPO leadership surveyed student-parents and found that more than 50 percent of respondents had ranked subsidized child care as “the most important family-related initiative that the university could undertake.”
They presented their findings to the GSAS administration and suggested the financial burden of child care could be alleviated by adding a bonus to student-parents’ stipends for each child.
Though the suggestion was “positively” received, the SPO never heard back from GSAS administration, according to Romney.
Hall declined to comment on the meeting.
Student-parents have also asked the graduate students union to address student-parent needs in the contract they are currently negotiating with the University.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers bargaining committee member Madeleine F. Jennewein wrote in an email that HGSU-UAW has supported the interests of student-parents since bargaining first started.
“The costs of having a family while also being a student are too high, and Harvard should do more to support student worker parents, both financially and with other forms of support,” Jennewein wrote. “Our union is calling for policies such as subsidies for childcare, guaranteed paid leaves, and dependent health insurance at no cost.”
Osuna said that when she lived in California with her husband who is also a graduate student, the union at his school — University of California, Santa Barbara — pushed the university to offer subsidized child care.
“[The UC’s] have a union, and that union is helpful,” she said. “If you’re an international student with a partner and you come to the university, they have a list of jobs your partner can take in the university… They also have fellowships specifically for student-parents. They also have a reduced rate for child care. It’s about $400 per month, and here it’s about $2,000.”
“There’s this cultural awareness about what’s going on when you’re a parent in the UC system that doesn’t exist here at Harvard,” she added.
Though some student-parents manage to connect with other students facing similar issues and create a supportive network, others are not as lucky.
“Socially I'm kind of a lone wolf,” said student-parent and single mother Lisa A. Kostur. “I don't have anybody around me who has the same situation with the same responsibilities… I don’t have a mirror.”
Kostur said that she “buffers” her student and parent identities. While at school, she keeps her parenthood to herself, and while at home she tries not to bring up her work.
“I'm never being a student-parent. I'm either being a student, or a parent. That's how I do it. I can't do it any other way,” she said.
The lack of a formalized path or example to follow is a common struggle many student-parents said they face at GSAS.
“There are no institutional paths that you can follow,” Osuna said. “And as an international student of color that’s very complicated. I think that Harvard is about 60 years behind where it should be.”
Yun said GSAS purposefully allows students to decide how they will spend their PAFS funding because it allows student-parents to better suit their own needs.
The time associated with child care also means that student-parents rarely have time to participate in extracurricular groups or programming, often leaving them socially isolated.
Graduate student-parents’ days usually begin before 8 a.m., when they drop their children off at daycare. For many, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is reserved for schoolwork — made difficult by the fact that collaborative projects and office hours generally do not operate so early in the day. Then, when classes end at 6 p.m., student-parents often rush home to pick up children, make dinner, and put their kids to bed.
“I’d love to be involved in student activities, but I can’t,” Osuna said.
Romney said he struggled to balance his work as a graduate student with parenting responsibilities during his first year as a father.
“It was extremely mentally distracting,” he said. “I want to do research and there's this constant nagging in the back of my mind, like, you know, we're living from paycheck to paycheck, and I don't know exactly where we're going to find the money to pay for health insurance when it comes due.”
Under O’Connor’s direction, the Graduate Student Council and SPO have worked to create programming specifically for student-parents. Their most important event of the year is the GSAS Family’s Brunch, an event during orientation week focused on connecting student-parents and creating a support network.
The GSC and SPO have also worked to gather data on student-parents and their challenges — information they regularly present to GSAS deans and from which they formulate policy proposals.
Even now, the GSC is looking to perform an in-depth assessment of lactation rooms across campus — many of which have fallen into disarray and are only accessible via a cumbersome online reservation system. After the assessment, the GSC will discuss renovating the rooms and rebuilding the online system to make it easier to use.
Despite the help that faculty and groups like the GSC and SPO offer, many graduate student-parents maintain that the work of the University is not finished.
“If there is no awareness about healthcare, housing, childcare, about the families needing help, and international students having babies, I think that’s problematic,” Osuna said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I grew up in a volleyball family. My dad played volleyball in college and at the professional level, playing in three different Olympics for the US volleyball team. Both of my brothers played volleyball in high school and one of them played at Stanford.”
For Matthew Ctvrtlik, a current junior and co-captain of the Harvard Men’s Volleyball team, volleyball had always been a part of his life. From a young age, his family had played volleyball and other sports together. So, when he made the transition to playing team volleyball in seventh grade, he found that the game came naturally to him.
“Volleyball was definitely a huge part of the community that I was in growing up. We had a middle school league and some of the teachers would even ref the games. In seventh grade, when I joined the middle school team, I really started becoming invested in the sport. I still talk to some of my great friends on that middle school team.”
As he transitioned to high school, Ctvrtlik found that his time was split between both volleyball and basketball. However, as his eye turned toward college, volleyball won out.
“Playing club volleyball in high school definitely let more college coaches see me in terms of scouting. Also, I played varsity volleyball for all four years of high school in a community of southern California that’s really strong in volleyball. But I as soon as I heard that Harvard wanted me, choosing to go here was definitely an easy decision for me. I love it here.”
“In my senior year of high school on my official visit, I was sitting outside of Eliot Courtyard and I was talking to my Dad on the phone and it was a beautiful weekend in the fall. I remember telling my Dad, ‘Hey, I think I could really see myself here.’ And that definitely summed it all up. The weather was nice, I was surrounded in a place that was wonderful and academically challenging and I loved every part of my visit.”
As a freshman and sophomore, Ctvrtlik overcame the natural adjustment from high school to college, both on and off the court. From starting college weight-training regiments, as well as focusing on fundamentals, the Newport Beach native quickly adapted to the steep learning curve.
“Definitely the biggest change is that everyone is taller and jumps higher. Physically, everyone’s a lot more gifted, and as a freshman, I hadn’t done any college training or experienced the speed of the game that college offers. It was definitely a wakeup call, as I didn’t even play the first month or so of season as I was still adjusting to college ball.”
“As a freshman, I was welcomed so quickly by the team. Being a younger guy on a team is difficult. You’re trying to fit in with the team, both on the court and off the court. Not only is there this period of your niche on the team, but for me there was also a focus on competing for that starting spot.”
However, last year, Ctvrtlik became one of the few junior captains in Harvard’s Men’s Volleyball history.
“Traditionally, at the end of the season, the entire team votes on who the next year’s captains will be. As a junior, this leadership role has definitely been one of the more challenging aspects for me personally. You need to find the balance of captaining and being a supportive friend; Everyone on the team is a grown man and is smart, intelligent, and a friend.”
In speaking about his role as a captain, Ctvrtlik put the emphasis on his team and his co-captain, senior Trevor Dow, before any personal achievements.
“I’m so proud of my team – I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but the guys are just amazing. Trev and I have worked out together really well and it’s definitely been a highlight of the season. The entire team has just blown past any of my expectations as people, players, friends, and just who they are. I’m just so happy that I’m here at Harvard playing volleyball.”
In regard to future endeavors with volleyball, Ctvrtlik could only chuckle and give a guess at what would happen in the future.
“Future volleyball career… maybe? I’m not exactly sure. I’ll be in southern California this summer which will be conducive to playing beach volleyball and indoor volleyball in my free time. I would love to continue playing volleyball. There’s always a bigger plan out there and I know hard work always pays off. So, I guess we’ll see where this path is going to lead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through March 25th, senior first baseman Patrick McColl was hitting a blistering .515, ranking first in the nation in batting average, winning three of the first four Ivy League Player of the Week awards.
Since then, McColl has cooled down to a still stellar .442, good for 6th in the nation in batting average. Hitting in the heart of the lineup, McColl has been the catalyst for a strong start for the Harvard Baseball team as they have gone 14-6 overall and 4-2 in the Ivy League.
“It feels great. It’s been pretty fun so far. You kinda go up there and try to get a hit every time you get up, and it’s been happening a good amount for me,” commented McColl on his early season success, “It definitely helps to have Jake Suddleson behind me in the order. He’s been hitting really well too, so I just think about that in the back of my mind when I’m up at the plate.”
The mentioned Suddleson is batting a hot .355 thus far, making the one two punch between the two, a key piece of the Crimson offense. The pair has accounted for just under half of Harvard runs, demonstrating their value to the team’s overall success.
In addition to his high batting average, McColl has hit 6 home runs and has batted in 25 runs. He ranks 4th in the NCAA in hits per game at 1.9 and 7th in slugging percentage at .826. It’s clear that McColl is not just a slap hitter poking singles just over the infield. He has hit for both power and average, anchoring the third spot in the order for the Harvard team. Much of his incredible success this year is due to some strategy change and dedicated hard work in the offseason.
“You’re just playing baseball, and something kinda clicked a little bit with my swing path,” McColl said about his tweaks to his swing, “[I’m] trying to get under the ball and put balls in the air - I’ve been trying to work on that over the summer and continue into the season, and it’s been working.”
There is no better way to provide context to this start than looking at the record books. If the season ended today, McColl would land second in all time single season batting average, just behind the leader Mike Stenhouse who hit .475 way back in 1977, and just above Barry Wood who hit .440 further back in 1932. The point is, this accomplishment is rare for any college athlete across the country and especially rare for any recent Crimson hitters.
However, this is not entirely uncharted territory for the infielder. As a sophomore, McColl hit a strong slash line of .355/.459/.621 on the way to All-Ivy League second team. Last season was not as strong for McColl on offense, but he found other ways to produce, leading the team in putouts and fielding percentage. This is one of the reasons McColl is more than a just a hitter. A leader on and off the field, the senior encapsulates hard work, which his teammates follow to their benefit.
“He’s so fun to play with. He’s a good leader and leads by example,” stated senior pitcher Kevin Stone on McColl, “he’s not a guy who jumps down your throat or yells at the top of his lungs all the time. He’s a quiet leader everyone feeds off. His energy he brings to the game makes him a pleasure to play with.”
McColl is a leader, incredible hitter, and the guy who the team counts on in big spots. As a freshman, the first baseman had the talent and skill to take him far, but his development has been up to him. He, every step of the way, has remained committed to making himself the best player he can be and the work is paying off this season. The effects have rippled throughout the team as the Harvard squad is playing with high confidence through the first month.
“I think that having that camaraderie and that confidence in the dugout really helps in games. You look in the dugout and you can compare our team to whatever team we’re playing - our team is usually having more fun, joking around and staying loose but also focusing in game,” commented McColl on the keys to the team’s strong performance, “I think that’s the way you gotta play baseball, because at the end of the day, it’s just a game and you’re trying to have fun.”
Looking forward, the baseball team has three games home against Yale this weekend. The team is excited for the rivalry matchup, riding the early season success. McColl will look to continue his hot start throughout the month, helping the Crimson to key victories in the process.

Sections
Each of the houses at Harvard has a very unique personality which is determined by both the people in the house and the house atmosphere itself. Since there are 12 houses and 12 zodiac signs, the stars are clear: each house clearly has its own zodiac sign.
Winthrop: LEO
This one is obvious. Besides having a lion as its house mascot, Winthrop has the aggressive personality commonly attributed to Leos. Leos and Winthropians alike tend to think they’re amazing at everything, and they’re not exactly wrong (at least where IMs are concerned).
Mather: ARIES
Aries and Matherites are both known for their unstoppable energy. While it can be a little chaotic and, let’s be real, ugly at some points, it is definitely a good time. Mather is a good house, and Aries is a good sign.
Dunster: VIRGO
Virgos are known for their perfectionist nature, and have you ever met a person in Dunster that isn’t completely type A? Both Virgos and Dunster residents are logical and practical, unless their practicality is overcome by their need for perfection.
Currier: CANCER
Cancers are known for being incredibly intuitive, and all Currierites have that sixth sense of knowing exactly when the next Quad shuttle will arrive. Cancers are also adaptable, similar to the trees of Currier house adapting to the Quad Life.
Eliot: GEMINI
A controversial house and a controversial sign. Geminis are polarizing, much like the qualities of Eliot house. On one hand you have the good location and Fete, on the other you have housing options that aren’t exactly at the top of the heap.
Lowell: SCORPIO
Scorpios and Lowellians are a powerful and a dominant force on campus. Lowellellians have a lot of passion for their own house, but you may have to remind them at some point to talk about something besides themselves.
Cabot: PISCES
We can’t get that image of the dancing Cabot cod from their housing video out of our heads, so obviously we had to put the fish together. Pisces and Cabotians are imaginative, as seen in the Cabot musical and the creative reasons they give for why you should really meet them in the Quad, rather than making them come to the river.
Quincy: LIBRA
Libras are known for being balanced but indecisive. Quincy truly is such a balanced house, but it can’t really decide if it’s in River East or the Square or River West. This gives Quincy the ability to empathize with all houses but identify with no one — useful, but sad.
Leverett: CAPRICORN
Capricorns are defined by their intellectualism and cold nature. Given the sheer quantity of math and physics nights held in Leverett, it stands that the house has an intellectual nature. The cold nature becomes clear when you try to swipe into the dhall and get brutally rejected by BonLee.
Pfoho: SAGITTARIUS
The independence of Sagittariuses and Pfoho residents really jumps out, especially those who get to live in the lovely (albeit isolated) Jordans. Sagittarius is also known as an optimistic sign, and nothing is more optimistic than believing you can really add “pf” to the beginning every word without it getting ridiculous.
Adams: TAURUS
The defining taurus qualities are loyalty and self-indulgence. With a location that close to all the food in the Square, we can’t really fault Adam’s residents for how often they go get Jefe’s or JP Licks. Adam’s residents are also so incredibly loyal to their house they were able to say that it’s “where all the action happens” in their housing day video without laughing.
Kirkland: AQUARIUS
Aquarius is known as an innovative sign, and boy did Kirkland change the game with their iconic housing day video to the tune of “We Didn’t Start the Fire”. Aquarius, like taurus, is also known as a loyal sign, and what’s more loyal than the amazing Kirkland dogs?
