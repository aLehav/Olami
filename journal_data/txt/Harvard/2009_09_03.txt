After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, the Harvard administration announced that budget cuts to the Quad shuttle service would be less substantial than previously stated. Last semester, students responded with understandable outrage to a College proposal to halt weeknight shuttle service at 1:30 AM. But now they can rest assured: The College has agreed to keep Quad shuttles running through 3:45 AM, meaning that weekday service will not be modified at all.  Students returning to the Quad from late nights studying in Lamont, socializing at the river, and engaging in extracurricular activities in the yard area will no longer be left out in the cold.	The revised set of cuts, which is limited to weekend mornings—when shuttles are little used and safety concerns less pressing—seems more reasonable. The policy reversal likely results from the vocal response to the original plan from the undergraduate population. Concerned students organized protests, circulated petitions, and made their voices heard. Students without a doubt deserve credit for organizing and expressing their displeasure effectively enough to force the College to change its plans. It is also encouraging to see that the administration kept an open mind about student feedback and revised their plan accordingly. The administration should learn from this experience, and make sure to gather greater student input before implementing policy changes in the future, rather than only learning about policy flaws after the fact. Hopefully, this welcome correction to the shuttle policy will be the beginning of a closer working relationship between the student body and the administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As shopping week draws to a close, get ready to dole out the cash. Whether you balance brimming piles of full-price textbooks and novels in a snaking line on the Coop’s top floor, log on to Half.com or Amazon and fill a virtual shopping cart, or stop by Gnomon Copy to place an order for $300 worth of bound essays, book-buying is usually stressful and costs a fortune. The worst part: There’s a good chance you’ll never even crack open that brand-new copy of “The Order of Things.” Come May, you might sell it back for a few measly dollars. But, fated as this cycle may seem, there is an alternative: considering why you lined up to buy that book in the first place.
Our insistence on purchasing texts in those early moments of the school year reflects enthusiasm—and starry-eyed idealism. This semester, we’ll do the reading. This semester, we’ll get something out of our classes. This semester, it will be different. I, for one, relish this attitude in myself and in my classmates. As long as the late-summer days stay warm and dorm-room decoration remains our biggest concern, there’s a real sense of possibility. But then reality catches up with us.
The truth of the matter: Many Harvard professors assign an inconceivable quantity of reading. Soon, overwhelmed by four (or five) classes’ worth of impossible course work, most Harvardians realize that they won’t survive unless they ditch some of their texts. Very few students I’ve met in my two-plus years here actually absorb word-for-word every assigned page (and the rare ones who review all the material do so over reading period).
But, while it may seem as if we don’t have any choice in the matter, there are ways to combat the post-shopping-period crash. The key is to prolong that initial sense of excitement that permeates the Coop in September—even once we realize we’re screwed. At that moment, instead of admitting failure, giving up, and declaring that life totally sucks, it’s hypothetically possible to stay starry-eyed. To see the coming semester as a puzzle. To pick and choose. To determine what’s actually necessary and fulfilling, and read it carefully; to skim some other, less important material; and to let go of the rest. 
My recent academic history, I admit, looks more like the first option than the second. When the wind starts to bite, generally in late October, I often find myself hopelessly facing a pile of books full of pristine, note-free margins. It’s a vicious cycle—such a situation can be so upsetting that I fail to open even one. And then, when the time comes to sell the volumes back, I can’t remember why I bought them in the first place.
Contrary to popular belief, however, there’s no Book God out there who mandates an all-or-nothing approach to reading. Who’s to say I’ll get bupkis out of “War and Peace” unless I can run my eyes over every single sentence? Instead of imposing self-defeating standards on ourselves, we burgeoning academics ought to feel comfortable engaging with a text to whatever degree we desire. Undergraduates deserve to make their academic careers their own—and to feel good about their performance even when it isn’t picture-perfect.
Idealistic as it might sound—this semester, it will be different. At least, that’s what I tell myself now.

At the turn of the 20th century, Harvard alumnus and Civil War veteran Major Henry Lee Higginson addressed the Harvard community on what he believed it most needed: a common space that all Harvard students could call their own. Higginson argued that the College exists “to furnish fit material for the building up of the Republic…good public and private citizens.”  For this task, he reasoned, “equipment is needed, beside teachers, lectures, and books, the freest and fullest intercourse between students.”  More than a century later, the major’s words still ring true.
Higginson’s grand gesture to Harvard was his 1899 gift of $150,000 for the creation of the Harvard Union, to be built on the site where the Barker Center stands today. The Union was constructed in 1902, and Higginson’s promise of “a house open to all Harvard men without restriction and in which they all stand equal” was for a time fulfilled. The New York Times concluded in 1913 that “the consensus of opinion seems to be that the Union is doing a great and much-needed work and that it is the most democratic influence in the university.”  But despite its success, the Union’s financial situation deteriorated over the years and it fell into disuse by the late 1920s.  In 1930, the space was converted into a freshman dining hall, which it remained until 1997, when it was turned into the Barker Center. 
It is well beyond time for the Harvard community to reignite Higginson’s vision. An internal Harvard memo obtained in 2005 by the Boston Globe demonstrated that Harvard students are less happy with their experience than their peers at an elite group of 31 colleges known as the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, with frustration at a lack of an adequate social life and campus community playing a significant role in that dissatisfaction. 
Fortunately, there is a movement afoot to restore the sense of unity to the Harvard community that Higginson championed. The Student Community Center Campaign, sponsored by the Undergraduate Council and endorsed by a broad coalition of students, student groups, and alumni, has taken great steps in the recent months to actualize this long-desired development for student life. It has drawn up building plans with a local architect, incorporated a non-profit foundation to oversee the project’s development, held high-level meetings with the administration, and convened a Campaign Advisory Council of student groups and a Board of Advisors of faculty and alumni. At the same time, thanks to significant negotiations, the SCCC on the verge of finalizing a deal for the purchase of 45 Mt. Auburn St., an extraordinarily well-located parcel of real estate with great potential for expansion.
In Harvard’s recent history, several stabs have been taken at this challenge, but previous top-down efforts to create a meaningful space for student life have been unsuccessful. The Loker Commons folded after great cost;  the Queen’s Head Pub, though admirable, is inaccessible to the majority of undergraduates; and the Student Organization Center at Hilles is too removed to provide a social alternative adequate for the Harvard community. If you pressed a Harvard student to name the social center of campus life, a clear majority might embarrassingly cite Lamont Café, which is, after all, in a library.
The alternative path that the SCCC presents is a bottom-up, student-driven, independent movement to bring a successful conclusion to this lengthy process to establish a social life for Harvard students. What it promises is a genuine rallying point for the entire Harvard community: a centrally located space for student groups to meet and host events, for alumni to take the pulse of the campus, for continuous planned and impromptu artistic exhibitions. Perhaps most importantly, a locale for individual students to come together and create the kind of spontaneous interactions that make it such a privilege to attend a school with so many remarkable people in it.
Harvard has been mastering the art of educating exceptional young minds in the classroom for nearly four centuries now, but it has only begun the process of integrating an extremely diverse collection of students—from different genders, races, ethnicities, religions, and socioeconomic classes—fairly recently, so work remains to be done. This drive for an independent, student-driven, fully inclusive, gender-neutral community center offers an opportunity for Harvard to continue its natural evolution, to continue its task of producing the best possible women and men to serve our republic. As Higginson put it in 1901, remembering his many classmates and comrades who had labored silently “in the background” to build up our university: “Our new house is built in the belief that here also will dwell this same spirit of democracy side by side with the spirit of true comradeship, friendship; but to-day this house is a mere shell, a body into which you, Harvard students, and you alone can breathe life and then by a constant and generous use of it educate yourselves and each other.”  
As daunting as the challenge may appear, it behooves the Harvard community to seize the opportunity before us and thereby make the most of our own educations by breathing life back into the major’s vision of an inclusive, democratic common space that all Harvard students can call their own.

Harvard College Library—which circulates over 11 million items and includes Widener, Lamont, and Cabot Science Libraries—has compiled a comprehensive online listing of its budget reductions in recent months, which range from large-scale staff reductions to thermostat adjustments and increased digitization of subscriptions.
The Web site includes various changes reported in the past, such as the relocation and streamlining of HCL Technical Services to a facility in Central Square, and the closing of the Quad library. 
But it also includes a few new changes, such as the closing of the Information Desk in the Widener Circulation room, the near-elimination of HCL’s travel budget, and an increase of the minimum lost book or item fee to $100.
In addition, several capital projects were suspended, such as the replacement of compact shelving in Harvard-Yenching Library and the heating and ventilation systems in Pusey Library.
HCL spokeswoman Beth S. Brainard declined to discuss the exact cost of those projects, but noted that the University classifies capital projects as all building work that costs more than $100,000. 
The Web site also provides more detail and context about recent changes. 
A thousand print subscriptions have been canceled in Widener alone to cut processing costs as HCL moves to a greater reliance on e-journals. 
HCL also announced yesterday that it has begun circulating 20 mini laptops in Widener to allow users to continue reading those electronic titles while freeing up stationary computers for quick tasks and searches.
The site also said that the 20 HCL layoffs announced this summer were part of a larger workforce reduction of roughly 100 that included 52 voluntary retirements and 20 job positions held open. 
Brainard said that depending on the time of year, HCL has approximately 450 full- and part-time employees, and 400 to 600 students and other workers.
The Web site said that due to the cuts, users may experience longer lines and less staff time. 
Brainard said HCL will help staff handle tasks and inquiries by cross-training reference and circulation staff, expanding student training, and offering more online services.
The recent budget cuts and costs of library maintenance has forced HCL to substantially reexamine its operations, and at a meeting for all HCL staff held on July 22, HCL’s head librarian Nancy M. Cline said that the unit “will not get by with modest, incremental change,” according to notes provided by Brainard. 
Cline reportedly said that ongoing economic turmoil could cause further cutbacks, and that HCL would likely emerge from the cuts as an organization vastly different from the one that exists today. 
She reportedly raised a host of questions examining what HCL’s primary mission should be, and asked whether there was work HCL could stop doing entirely or whether the unit would need all the libraries it currently operates, according to Brainard’s notes.
“We have not changed our mission,” Cline reportedly said at the meeting. “However, we will need to work creatively on how to do it with smaller staff and fewer dollars.”

Starting this academic year, prescription drug benefits and all lab services will no longer be covered under the mandatory Harvard University Health Services fee, and students will also see a modest hike in copayments.
Pharmacy and lab testing benefits will instead be available under the supplemental portion of the University’s student health insurance plan. Students covered under their parents’ insurance plans have the option of waiving the supplemental coverage.
As a result of the insurance policy changes, all students will now pay $1126 in student health fees for the year—down $300 from last year. The cost of the supplemental plan has increased from $1404 to $1714 this year in order to absorb the additional pharmacy and lab testing benefits.
The overall cost for the University’s two-part student health plan has gone up by only $10.
Already, more than 4,500 students have waived the supplemental plan, according to Paula Fiore, the director of Plan Operations and Member Services. 
This number typically exceeds 5,000 by Sept. 30, the deadline for all waiver requests, she added.
“We did a lot of work to keep the increase as low as possible,” said Mark L. Hurwitz, finance director of the University’s health plans. “We want to try to keep the premiums low for our students.”
Changes to Harvard’s student health insurance policy also include higher copayments, as drug prices have gone up roughly 20 percent from last year, Hurwitz said.
The Student Health Planning Committee, established in January 2003 by University Provost Steven E. Hyman to review the structure of Harvard’s student health plans every year, had to decide between raising the insurance premium or increasing copayments, said Hurwitz.
Fiore added that it “made the most sense” to raise copayments, which have remained roughly the same for the past few years.
To waive the supplemental plan, go to www.tinyurl.com/mcrnhm or call Member Services at (617) 495-2008.

A new iPhone application called “Outbreaks Near Me” that allows users to track and report local outbreaks of infectious disease was released Tuesday.
Developed by researchers at Children’s Hospital Boston and the MIT Media Lab, the application combines the GPS system of the iPhone with outbreak tracking information from HealthMap.org, a web prowling system that mines official and unofficial Internet data sources for information on outbreaks of emerging, infectious diseases.  
“Outbreaks Near Me” provides “location based alerting” of infectious disease outbreaks, according to HealthMap co-founder John S. Brownstein, an assistant professor at the Children’s Hospital Informatics Program (CHIP). Users can also choose to set alerts to notify users of new local outbreaks or when they are entering new areas.
“If people know what’s happening around them, they might be more likely to take basic precautions,” such as washing their hands and getting vaccinated, Brownstein said. 
On top of alerting users to outbreaks, the application allows users to submit reports, even photos if they want, of potential outbreaks from their own phones, which would be reviewed by HealthMap, according to HealthMap co-founder Clark Freifeld. 
UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 said that although the application will probably not be helpful in diagnosing individual H1N1 cases, it is a “very interesting technique” that could provide health officials with additional information on general incidence trends.
“Using more contemporary ways of reporting what’s going on in the community can help public health officials find out [about disease outbreaks] at the earliest possible moment,” said Donald A. Goldmann, a professor in Immunology and Infectious Disease at Harvard Medical School when asked about the application. “This is a nifty, portable way to get people’s attention, especially young people.”
Some students, however, are skeptical of whether the application will be useful in practice.
Russell C.S. Mason ’10 said he would probably not use the application. “I think it would be really stressful and incite a lot of panic.” 
And Sean R. Singh ’12 said, “I hardly use many of the apps on my phone; if it was important it would show up on my News app. I’m not going to spend my time worrying about H1N1.”
“Outbreaks Near Me” is available for download for no cost in the iTunes App Store.

In response to student opposition, Harvard Medical School is backtracking on a recent policy that would restrict student interaction with the media, school officials said yesterday.
Following the policy’s addition to the student handbook this fall, several students on campus suggested that the policy was an attempt to silence their opinions on the recent conflict of interest debate.
Over the past several years, student groups have been pushing for stricter policies to regulate industry ties at both the Medical School and at its affiliated hospitals. Tensions between the administration and a small group of vocal first-years mounted last year, intensifying when students took their campaign to the New York Times and publicly challenged the Medical School with mixed success.
Now second-year students David C. Tian and Kirsten Austad, who have been lobbying administrators for tighter conflict of interest policies, wrote in a joint e-mail to the Times that “it is hard to imagine that this new policy is not somehow related to the past advocacy efforts of students.”
In light of this negative attention, the Dean for Students, Nancy E. Oriol, said in a statement that the school temporarily pulled the policy from the online version of the student handbook, “because it has been so completely misconstrued.”
She added that “students are unequivocally free to talk to anyone at anytime,”  Oriol was not available for an interview with The Crimson yesterday, but told the Times on Tuesday that “the wording is problematic and it doesn’t really capture our intent.”
Oriol, however, did not deny that the policy was drafted in response to student attacks earlier this year on the influence of pharmaceutical companies on medical education.
In an e-mail circulated to the Medical School community on Aug. 25 detailing revisions to the student handbook, the policy addition reads: “All interactions between students and the media should be coordinated with the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of Public Affairs. This applies to situations in which students are contacted by the media as well as instances in which students may be seeking publicity about a student-related project or program.”
Though news of this particular addition likely slipped the attention of most students—as it was sandwiched in a long list of other revisions—several students and faculty protested the policy’s implications.
“Last time I checked, being a student did not diminish my rights,” said Brian S. Fuchs ‘04, a third-year medical student. “It’s something I’d expect from a medical school in Iran, not Harvard Medical School.”
But at the same time, Fuchs said that he did not think the administrators actually intended to suppress the student body’s right to freedom of speech despite the policy’s wording.
“I find it hard to believe that the administration is opposed to students voicing their opinions,” Fuchs said. “I went to Harvard for college and am here for medical school, and I have never felt that they were really trying to get in the way of what I said.”

A cross-section of Harvard’s top administrators tried to sell the College’s new General Education program yesterday to an audience of around 200, made up mostly of administrators, professors teaching Gen Ed classes, and a handful of freshmen.Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds acknowledged that the curriculum’s development process has been “a long one—sometimes exciting and sometimes exasperating.” But University President Drew G. Faust tried to shore up hope for the future by tying Gen Ed to Harvard’s past.“I see this as a historic moment,” Faust said. “Now we find ourselves in 2009 with both continuity and change—with an affirmation of the principle that there should be special courses designed, in the words of [General Education task force co-chair] Alison Simmons, to bring knowledge to the student.”Faust detailed the progression from Harvard’s first Gen Ed report in 1945 to the Core Curriculum of the 1970s to today’s Gen Ed program. Simmons discussed how Gen Ed addresses two main themes: change and globalization.“Things change, and they change quickly,” Simmons said. “The hot new computer that you just got for college will be a dinosaur by the time you’re a junior.”The curricular implementation has sparked concerns from students and faculty members about the number of requirements, the broadness of the guidelines defining the eight course categories, and similarities to the Core curriculum. “Creating and instituting a new general education program tends to create...anxiety,” said English professor Louis Menand, who co-chaired the Gen Ed task force that wrote the curricular legislation. “One reason is that the general education program represents the Faculty’s collective judgment about what every students ought to know, and since professors are all trained in different disciplines, this can be a difficult conversation to have.”“We are just not accustomed to thinking about education in general terms,” he continued. “It’s not our specialty.” Menand declined to comment after the speech in Lowell Lecture Hall about how Gen Ed’s course offerings have shaped up so far, explaining that he is not involved in the curriculum’s implementation since the Faculty voted in favor of the Gen Ed legislation in May 2007. A couple of hours later, he e-mailed The Crimson explaining, “Sorry if I was tongue tied at the gen ed event...it is a really promising launch.”After Menand and Simmons spoke, they participated in a question-and-answer session. Of the four people asking questions, at least two worked for the College. R.J. Jenkins, the Advising Program Office’s sophomore advising director, asked for Menand to expand more on “what’s happening in the classroom” since he thinks “pedagogical innovation” is “an exciting thing about what’s happening.”Following the event, administrators were available to speak with students at the Queen’s Head Pub. The College has also been marketing Gen Ed to students via course trailers on the Gen Ed Web site and communication through the Peer Advising Fellow program. —Staff writer Bonnie J.

A New York City resident charged with murdering a Cambridge man in a Harvard University dorm had his probable cause hearing, originally scheduled to take place yesterday, moved to Oct. 19.Jason Aquino, who has been charged with murder, firearm use in a felony, accessory after the fact, and armed robbery, is accused of participating in the killing of Justin Cosby, a 21-year old Cambridge resident unaffiliated with the University, in Kirkland House earlier this year.Authorities arrested Aquino this July in his Harlem apartment, and he was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court the next day.He pled not guilty in August to all four charges.The probable cause hearing, which will be held in Cambridge District Court, will allow a judge to determine whether the prosecution has enough evidence to charge a crime outside of its jurisdiction, according to the Massachusetts Bar Association Web site.Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts, 19, and Jabrai J. Copney, 20, who both live in New York, have also been implicated in the murder, which allegedly took place inside the Kirkland Annex and drew national media attention.They allegedly participated in what officials called a “drug rip” and were not Harvard students. Four ounces of marijuana were found near the body of the shooting victim.—Staff writer Eric P.

We’re back for another year of FlyBy, and your favorite series “Around the Ivies.” With some Ivy League newspapers out of hibernation and others not, here’s a sampling of what’s been going on around our friendly rival schools.
Yale
Yale is one-upping us again.  They’re moving forward with plans to build two new residential colleges—sticking to plans to demolish historic buildings including the Seeley G. Mudd Library, Hammond Hall, and Brewster Hall—while our much touted “House renewal” process won’t start until at least 2012, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith. Some locals and preservationists may be fighting for the buildings to be saved, but Yale University President Richard Levin told the Yale Daily News that the two new residential colleges will probably open in 2015 or 2016.
Meanwhile, though President Faust has taken it up as her mission to (try to) expand the arts at Harvard without disrespecting all those laid off staffers, Yale College has created a new position for an arts dean.  According to the YDN, Dean Susan Cahan’s responsibilities will include “[developing] new programs in the arts” and making room for more artistic space. While Harvard does have its own Office for the Arts, this year it will probably be more focused on budget cuts than “new programs.”
That said, Harvard did recently release reports both on the arts and on House renewal—and words clearly speak louder than actions.
Princeton
The only consistent news item that seems to have been going on at Princeton (besides budget cuts) is that sketchy men have been exposing themselves to women on campus. In fact, it’s happened four times since mid-spring, and the police have arrested two men so far. The latest incident happened at 10:30 p.m. on August 1, when a female visitor was stopped by a man asking for directions, and as she gave directions, she noticed he was exposing himself. April and May saw randos masturbating and exposing themselves on campus as well.
This seemingly random “string of incidents” must have some cause. Is it just the recession, or is it part of a larger malaise that afflicts people who have to live in New Jersey?
Columbia
Though Columbia was ranked number 8 in U.S. News' college rankings, Columbia's Bwog takes a stab at Harvard by calling us "financially incompetent," even if we beat them again next year:
60 comments ensue about Columbia's acceptance rate and...outsourcing sex to other New York colleges. "can the men at NYU integrate your curves?" inquires one commenter.
Brown
Emma Watson is coming!  Yeah. We guess they win for the week.

Stroll through the Greenhouse Café this month, and you may notice something missing. You can still get California-style tacos, Sicilian pizza, or an All-American burger, but if it’s Indian food you’re after, you can just forget it.
Monsoon Kitchen, the section of the café that served Indian cuisine, was temporarily replaced for the summer by American Barbecue, a special menu of Southern food. This is the first time Greenhouse changed its menu according to the season, and no one at the café, not even the manager Brad Hartman, could tell FlyBy why. Is it some kind of marketing ploy? Does Indian food not sell well during the summer or something? Oh well, we were just curious. And craving curry.
We’re told that the Indian cuisine will be coming back on Sept. 28, so if you actually prefer the Southern food, make sure to enjoy it before it disappears with the warm weather.
What’s on the menu? Get the dish after the jump.Here are the official offerings, as posted on the HUDS website:
•	Barbecued chicken
•	Pulled pork
•	Baked beans
•	Corn on the cob
•	Coleslaw
•	Potato salad
•	Watermelon
•	Lemonade
Today FlyBy also noticed corn bread, broccoli, Salisbury steak, and mac and cheese (which seemed particularly yellow-orange). As with most Greenhouse fare, the offerings seemed more brightly colored than your typical dining hall food, which we suppose is a good thing. Just one note: FlyBy recommends you skip the coleslaw and potato salad, unless you like your food sampled first by tiny flies. Consider yourself warned.
