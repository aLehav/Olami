After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s “break up with your significant other” season.
To be fair, every season at Harvard might as well be “break up with your S.O.” season. Never before have I seen so many messy romantic relationships (and breakups) than at Harvard. Stifling sobs in communal bathrooms, second-guessing every amorphous figure at a too-dark party, running away to New Haven. When it comes to the ends of relationships, Harvard students run the gamut of every unfortunate response to trauma.
Breakups suck — you don’t need me or astrology to tell you that. Often, when romantic relationships end, we think the issue is us. That we did something wrong. That we didn’t try hard enough to make it work. That we are simply unworthy of love.
This is the Harvard mentality of total, fatal self-agency at work, even in our most private, non-academic, romantic lives. It’s almost self-centered, the way we think that we are always in control and directly responsible for any situation we played any role, major or minor, in.
I, too, have made the jump in reasoning from breakup to self-criticism before. Personally, I’m a Mars-Venus conjunct in Scorpio. In astrology, Venus is the planet of romance, soft affection, and pleasure; Mars is the planet of feral animal instinct and unchecked aggression. My Mars and Venus are conjunct, meaning they lined up one right on top of the other in the sky when I was born. The energies of planets in conjunction smash together into one hyper-focused beam. When those planets work well together, that’s wonderful! But when they’re essentially opposites, like my Venus and Mars, they only cause problems. Like two positive magnets pushed too close together, all they want to do is flip out.
The claustrophobic tension of my Mars-Venus conjunct isn’t helped by the sign they’re in: Scorpio, characterized by brooding, dark intensity. Clearly, this is not an ideal Venus placement. My Mars-Venus Conjunct in Scorpio says a lot of things, none of them great, about how I love: too deeply, swinging rapidly from fond to tempestuous, with a throat sealed shut in rage. It’s a warning sign to anyone with any astrological familiarity: I am not a good person to date.
Of course, astrology’s not always right; it just gives you another perspective on yourself. I look at my Mars-Venus conjunct in Scorpio and, because I am only human, and because I am a Harvard student who thinks everything I am a part of that breaks indicates a part of me that is broken, I wonder. I wonder if this placement affects my romantic relationships. I wonder if it causes my breakups.
But there’s no use in thinking like that. Broken relationships are not individual failures; it takes two to tango, after all. If you’ve ever Googled “[insert sun sign here] compatibility,” you know that astrology looks at relationships based on not just individuals but the pair. Astrology teaches us that relationships are about combined synergy, not individual action; when they end, it’s not either one person’s fault, but the fault of the mismatched energy between the two of them. There is nothing wrong with either of you; you’re just not compatible.
As much as it might seem like it, as much as it might hurt to know otherwise, your compatibility with another person is not in your control. Even if you could perfectly change yourself to fit right in as the missing puzzle piece to a romantic prospect’s jigsaw, you can’t control how they feel about you. Maybe they just get the heebie-jeebies by the way you laugh, or are put off by your enthusiasm to be with them, or find the maximally-compatible version of yourself unsettlingly fake. The parameters of compatibility are always shifting in ways you can’t account for. And so tragedies, from breakups to miscommunications, happen outside of our control. All we can do is to make peace with them.
You will suffer sucky breakups. But through all of them, you remain worthy of love — no matter how complicated your Venus situation is. As the stars spin in the sky, eventually, someone is born under a configuration that clicks with your own Venus. By pure number-crunching alone, there is someone out there for you.
You are searching for that person, I’m sure. Like all Harvard students, you are always on the quest for betterment. But unlike other Harvard goals — consulting club promotions, successful midterm regrades, intramural team wins — this one will come to you in time, without trying to game the system first. Until then, treat yourself with that kindness and love you crave, through all the rough patches and breakups that feel like the end of the world. And one day, the stars will reciprocate, bringing reciprocated romantic love in spades.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Somehow, it’s already November, and with the days getting colder and the hues of the leaves getting warmer, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time reflecting on my first “real” semester of college: one with open dining halls, weekend parties, and in-person classes. And with the Dean of Students Office’s review of the blocking process underway, I’ve reflected on my own blocking group experiences and my new social life here at Harvard, which has been in stark contrast to last semester’s weeks of lounging in pajamas and hanging out with my dog.
Personally, I couldn’t be happier with my blocking group. We met through Covid-19 testing station run-ins, pre-orientation programs, extracurriculars, and mutual friends, and we were quick to stick together despite our limited interactions. Regardless of the fact that blocks during the past pandemic year formed from branching out, I’ve noticed that there is certainly an, at first imperceptible, cliquey vibe to House life. This revelation wasn’t particularly surprising; after all, the blocking structure inherently ushers most of us into groups.
And groups isolate. Since we typically choose groups based on who we want to spend time with, it’s all too easy for groups to become isolated bubbles of like-minded individuals selected based on freshman year social preferences. These bubbles collectively reinforce social stratification as they stay intact over the next three years. Rather than encouraging us to get to know those outside our usual communities, such policies can cement groups and stifle social exploration and connectivity past “our people.” After all, Harvard provides an invaluable opportunity to interact with, what is for many, one of the most diverse communities that they have ever encountered. So why sort and separate multitudes of stories and experiences into isolated groups? Instead of feeding into a culture of cliques and self-segregation that originates from the formation of blocking groups, we should dare to explore outside of them. Doing so will construct a true sense of community throughout the College and de-emphasize blocking groups as the social center of our time here.
Of course, this is not to say that blocking groups are without merit. Within them, we can find deep friendship, support, and solidarity. However, I believe similarly important benefits can be found outside of group settings. Personally, I’m fairly unfamiliar with the friend group experience. My middle school friend group dissolved dramatically and catastrophically in seventh grade, and that was truly for the better. After that, I was never part of friend groups at school and instead had very strong, powerful, and intimate friendships with a handful of best friends individually. From each of them, I learned so much about various experiences, interests, and perspectives. We grew up through the good, the bad, and the ugly in the worlds we encountered, together and apart.
Here at Harvard, it’s safe to say that things have been different. Of course, the pandemic limited friend-making opportunities. This fall, I understandably prioritized getting to know my blockmates over meeting new people, which I don’t regret at all. But on my long walks to class, I reminisce about run-ins on the street with freshman seminar buddies, anime marathons with close friends and the strangers they brought along, and a club conversation under a multicolored parachute. In calls home, I’m most excited to share the interactions outside of my social circles. I excitedly dish out the details of the times that I sat with new people in the dining hall, caught up with the summer camp friends here who knew me long before I was ever a Harvard student, and struck up conversation with someone locked out at the House gate. There’s something special and precious about these encounters, these moments in which we, virtual strangers or distant acquaintances, spark a connection that feeds a community. It’s the promise of community that drew me to Harvard in the first place.
Going forward, I hope to intentionally create space to meet people outside of my blocking group and cultivate my connections at the college. If you’re reading this, I urge you too to help break down the blocking barriers and try to step outside your social circle a bit more. If you only stay in your blocking group, never breaking the bubble, you not only disservice yourself by missing out on all that Harvard has to offer, but you also perpetuate cliquish echo chambers that chip away at a community that could uplift us all. At risk of sounding idealistic, together, we can create a much stronger, genuine, and widespread culture of camaraderie, in which “our people” are everywhere, both within and beyond the blocking group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part of the unique excitement that comes with being a freshman at Harvard is the blocking process: finding a group of up to eight peers to live with, potentially linking with another group, and eventually having all of this chaos and anticipation crescendo into being lotteried into one of the 12 College Houses.
Despite this exhilaration that comes with the blocking process, a recent Undergraduate Council survey reported that, for many students, blocking was a challenging and stressful experience. As such, the administrators at the Dean of Students Office have decided to review the blocking process with affiliates at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Let us begin by saying that we firmly understand why the blocking process feels like a stressor for so many of our peers. The blocking process can, on the whole, feel like a massive social experiment. It forces students to self-select into groups and, too often, threatens to reveal the unsettling biases that inform which characteristics students deem socially desirable. Blocking may also engender social maneuvering and networking that is inherently oppositional to the formation and fostering of genuine friendships. We have to wonder if this is ultimately worth it — to go through our very first year of college with the perception that it is essential to have a group of people with whom you certainly want to live, and who certainly want to live with you — when in reality you’ve only known each other for a few months.
For some students, the blocking process may be extremely simple and stress-free, but speaking anecdotally, it seems rare to survive the endeavor without a few relational casualties. To keep these casualties to a minimum and to make the process less cut-throat, we must shift our perception of the blocking. We believe that this starts with understanding that blocking groups are ultimately not that a big deal; you’ll find friends wherever you go.
To that end, Peer Advising Fellows and upperclassmen are the members of the Harvard community who are best positioned to set the institutional tone for newly-arrived freshmen. These upperclass students are often beckoned to provide support and guidance to others, and thus must work hard to deliver the message that blocking does not wholly define your Harvard experience. Moreover, PAFs can help to destigmatize blocking groups of one and assure freshmen that, despite the undue stress that blocking may temporarily deliver, their housing situations will ultimately be more than okay.
Our blocking system is perhaps not perfect, and we would welcome creative amendments driven by data and findings about the current system. These changes could take many forms, such as randomly generated blocking groups, but must be driven by real research on the student experience. While we wait for such metrics and analyses to be unearthed, we must in the meantime focus on improvements to blocking culture.
Finally, we encourage our freshmen, rather than toiling over blocking, to look forward to reveling in the true center of community at Harvard: House life. House culture broadly is indeed much more important than any individual blocking group, as it encapsulates a stronger microcosm of community on campus. Much of this beauty comes from the randomness of the Housing system, which helps to bring a diverse array of students under one roof and which ultimately has helped to cultivate a collection of unified, cohesive, and vibrant House communities.
The Harvard experience is, indeed, about so much more than any isolated group of one to eight. Instead, it’s about the dozens, if not hundreds, of other wonderful people whom you will meet along the way — the people with whom you might not share a room, but with whom you may share years’ worth of experiences instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 7, 2021 at 4:45 p.m.
Aknazar “Adam” Kazhymurat ’23, a student from Kazakhstan, was found dead Friday in his home country, according to Kazakh media reports.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Kazhymurat’s death in an email to College students and staff Sunday afternoon after the College spoke with Kazhymurat’s family, Khurana wrote.
According to Kazakh media reports, Kazhymurat was found dead Friday in the Bostandyk District of Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan and Kazhymurat’s hometown, after going missing two days earlier. The local police found no signs of physical violence, per Kazakh media, and a cause of death has yet to be determined.
Since completing his freshman year in spring 2020, Kazhymurat had been on a leave of absence from his studies, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Khurana wrote in his email that Kazhymurat, a Kirkland House resident, was “a deeply valued and loved member” of the College.
“Aknazar had a natural talent for mathematics. He spent his time on campus tutoring other students in math and was very committed to helping others,” Khurana wrote. “His first-year entryway knew him as someone who loved learning and was always eager to help others with homework or whatever they needed.”
When Aknazar’s freshman year on campus was cut short by the coronavirus pandemic, he said he would miss the people he met in Cambridge, per Khurana’s email.
“We are lucky to have known Aknazar,” Khurana wrote. “He made us a better community, and we will miss him.”
In his email, Khurana encouraged grieving affiliates to seek out support from family, friends, and Harvard resources, including Counseling and Mental Health Services, which operates a 24/7 support line at (617) 495-2042.
“News like this impacts all of us. There are no adequate words to capture the pain and grief you may feel while learning of Aknazar’s passing,” he wrote. “We know those of you who are grieving will seek comfort in different ways.”
Kirkland House will hold a gathering in the Junior Common Room at 7 p.m. on Sunday night to support students in the wake of the announcement.
Prior to arriving at Harvard, Kazhymurat graduated from the Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Physics and Mathematics in Almaty. The school wrote in a statement Friday that Kazhymurat’s death “echoed in our hearts with immense pain.”
“Through his example, Aknazar inspired hundreds of students in the country, that great results can be achieved through hard work,” the statement reads. “In this difficult hour, we mourn together with the family of Aknazar.”
Upon his admission to Harvard, Kazhymurat received congratulations from the president of Kazakhstan, according to a school news article in 2018. Kazhymurat said at the time that he planned to practice science in Kazakhstan after completing his Harvard degree.
In an Instagram post Friday, the Central Asian Student Association at Harvard expressed condolences for Kazhymurat’s death.
“Many of us knew him personally, and his personality trait was well-loved among his friends at Harvard. We pray for his soul to rest in peace,” the post states. “We extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this period of mourning.”
CORRECTION: November 7, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated that Kazhymurat completed his sophomore year before taking a leave of absence. In fact, he had only completed his freshman year.

The Undergraduate Council passed legislation establishing a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subsidy program and providing free laundry detergent to College students during a Sunday meeting.
The transportation legislation allocates $2,880 from the Social and Residential Life Committee to subsidize MBTA tickets for undergraduate students. It aims to eliminate the financial burden T tickets impose on low-income students.
“Transportation constitutes a substantial financial constraint on low-income students at Harvard College,” the legislation reads. “Students and low-income individuals have called for a free MBTA and have proposed resolutions in light of the financial burden it imposes.”
The MBTA offers an 11 percent discount to students at more than 50 colleges and universities in the area. Though the program extends to graduate schools at Harvard, it does not include the College.
As a result, the UC will choose 200 students through a lottery and grant them three round-trip T tickets.
The legislation also calls for the UC to communicate with the MBTA to promote future partnerships to subsidize tickets for undergraduates.
The legislation was sponsored by Pforzheimer House Representative Lisa R. Mathew ’24 and Winthrop House Representative Kimani E. Panthier ’24.
The second piece of legislation provides environmentally-friendly detergent to undergraduate dorms and houses to relieve the financial burden laundry expenses impose on students.
“Providing free laundry detergent to students will lessen the financial burden of doing laundry,” the legislation reads.
In 2020, the Council partnered with the detergent company ECOS — the most sustainable brand of detergent, according to the Harvard Office for Sustainability — to offer free detergent to affiliates living in undergraduate residential housing. The UC halted the program at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and officially reinstated it with Sunday’s legislation. The Council plans to distribute the detergent bottles to the dorms and houses over the course of three weeks.
The council said it will look into reestablishing its partnership with ECOS to expand the free detergent program in the future.
“The Undergraduate Council [will] reopen communications with ECOS to explore possible long-term partnerships regarding laundry detergent for students,” the legislation reads.
The legislation was sponsored by Ivy Yard Representative Michael Zhao ’25 and Lowell House Representative David Zhang ’23.

Researchers at Harvard and Baylor University launched a $43.4 million research initiative last month to examine the causes of “human flourishing.”
The initiative, announced on Oct. 29, is the largest-ever of its kind.
The study involves 240,000 individuals hailing from 22 countries. The study will annually collect data on various measures relating to their well-being over the course of five years. Gallup, an analytics and advisory company known for its public opinion polls, and the Center for Open Science, a non-profit that aims to increase transparency in research, have also joined the partnership.
Human flourishing means “living in a state in which all aspects of a person’s life are good,” according to Tyler J. VanderWeele, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program.
VanderWeele, who is a co-director of the study, said he hopes the study can more rigorously assess the wide variety of factors that affect a person’s well-being.
“We often do a really good job at studying physical health and studying income — those are really important, but people care about more than that,” he said. “They also care about being happy, and having a sense of meaning and purpose, and trying to be a good person, and about their relationships.”
The study’s co-director, Byron R. Johnson, who directs Baylor’s Institute for Studies of Religion and serves as a professor of social sciences there, said the concept of flourishing is “much broader than happiness.”
“That’s why the survey instrument itself is so important – because it does gauge a number of things,” he said. “‘Do you have meaning in your life? Do you have a purpose for your life? Are you satisfied with where you’re headed?’”
The survey will test six domains to establish a “flourishing index” – including questions on life satisfaction, purpose, and mental and physical health – and will use nationally representative sampling.
“It’s not a convenience sample, it’s based on Gallup’s survey infrastructure, which they’ve developed over the last 15 years,” VanderWeele said. “We’ll be recruiting into the study a group of people that at least approximately represents the demographic and cultural characteristics of the entire country.”
The study will be the “first-ever global longitudinal panel,” meaning that it collects multidimensional data over time, according to Joe Daly, a senior partner at Gallup.
“These kinds of studies are increasingly rare because they’re so expensive and they’re so labor intensive,” Johnson said. “We wanted to do something that would help us move the needle on causal kinds of analyses, so that we’re not always having to rely on correlational studies.”
Daly also said the study will be one of the first that examines all major world religions, in contrast with previous religion studies that tended to focus on Judaism or Christianity.
“We’re going to get to look at the construct of spirituality and religion and human flourishing across all those major religion sets and cultural sets in the same methodology, with the same questionnaire, so that there will be the ability to start to see what these things look like across those different religions,” he said.
In partnering with the Center for Open Science, the flourishing study will make its data publicly accessible.
“We really hope that it contributes not only to our own research, but to the research of others and the study and promotion of well-being around the world,” VanderWeele said.
Johnson said the researchers are “optimistic” that the study may extend beyond five years or expand to include more countries.
“We hope that we’ll have 30 countries before it’s all said and done,” he said. “If we can keep it going for 10 years, and 10 waves of data — at that point, nothing’s ever happened like that before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council celebrated its 40th anniversary with a banquet in the Smith Campus Center Sunday evening.
The event featured speeches from Florida State Rep. Fentrice D. Driskell ’01 and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, as well as a panel of former Council leaders, Rudd W. Coffey ’97, William A. Greenlaw ’17, Daniel V. Banks ’17, and Ajay V. Singh ’22.
In her keynote speech, Driskell told attendees her experience on the Council left her with many lasting life lessons.
“Understanding my truth and defying expectations have been two of the greatest keys to whatever model of success that I’ve had in life,” she said. “I came to better understand both of those concepts and how to deploy them effectively through my time on the Undergraduate Council.”
Driskell said throughout her career she has learned the importance of recognizing that everyone faces self-doubt.
“Maybe some of you have dealt with this feeling in your lives or maybe not, but imposter syndrome is that nagging unease that rises up when you feel like you don’t quite belong — that you’re not quite prepared enough,” she said. “I can tell you that everybody deals with imposter syndrome at some point. It’s a universal phenomenon that most of us will feel whether you're rich or poor, pauper or princess, and it’s okay.”
“Recognize that you’re not alone – it’s just that most people never talk about it,” she added.
Panelists discussed the significance of the Council in shaping their lives both during and after college.
Greenlaw, who served as finance committee chair, said the Council was his “favorite thing to do.”
“The reason that I enjoyed it is because I took heart in the idea that I was representing what students wanted,” he said. “I was representing what they asked me to do, the change they wanted to see done and I was doing my very best to try and make that happen.”
Banks, who was vice president of the Council from 2016 to 2017, said close interpersonal relationships within the Council, particularly between the president and vice president, are crucial to its functioning. He said he and former Council president Shaiba Rather ’17 were “best friends.”
“The UC could be brought to its knees by an ineffective administration, specifically the president and the vice president,” he said. “At one point in my administration, an administrator said to me and Shaiba, ‘It’s like you two are married.’”
“We weren’t married,” he added. “We were in unison at all times.”
Coffey, a former chair of the Campus Life Committee, said his experience on the Council taught him that enacting change requires patience.
“Any kind of large bureaucracy, any kind of institution, it’s not going to change overnight,” he said. “You’ve got to be patient. You’ve got to keep trying, you’ve got to come up with different ideas.”
Singh, a former chair of the Academic Life Committee, said the Council sometimes focused on “nitty gritty” legislation instead of issues that more directly impacted students.
“Sometimes we would have really important legislation,” he said. “But instead of spending time talking about those issues and arguing over the merits of that statement and what the content was, we would spend two hours talking about a really nitty gritty amendment to the Constitution that litigated what issues and what bills we should talk about first or talk about last — things that didn’t matter to the student body.”
Jack M. Swanson ’22, a Council member who attended the event, said he enjoyed hearing the perspectives of the alumni panelists.
“I think it’s pretty rare that we get to hear from people who’ve served in the past and hear their experiences,” he said. “It’s great to see them all in one room.”

Cambridge has finally hit us with the notorious cool temperatures. (Why did it lowkey catch me off guard?) As I shuffled through all my packed coats from storage, I couldn’t help but wonder what everyone else was going to be wearing now that the temp has hit below 50. So, being the very observant person I am, I took note on a chilly day and created personalities for you based on your jacket!
Pea/Trench Coat
Come through, fashion icon! You care a lot about layering and love looking put-together. (You do it flawlessly btw). Your fit is probably on my pinterest board!
Normal Puffer Coat
You’re practical and love being warm. Winter and fall make very little difference to you. You also probably give people perplexed stares when they aren’t wearing a jacket!
Short Puffer Coat
Okay influencer! Extra points if it’s a really thick/puffy one! You also like being warm but feel like it’s just a little too early to bring out the winter puffer. Your pants are usually really cute and accentuate your outfit well.
Shacket
You’re not as practical or warm as the former jacket-wearers, however you look so stylish! This does not apply if your shacket is wool-lined. If that’s the case, then you are smarter than all of us. (Note: for those who do not know, a shacket is essentially a cross between a shirt and jacket. Think plaid shirt jacket and that’s the general vibe here.)
Canada Goose
It’s not time yet, guys. Nothing further to say.
Leather Jacket
I find you very cool. It’s hard to pull off but those who do, really do it well! You probably have on cute sneakers or docs and I may or may not have a crush on you.
Hoodie
Comfort is key for you and you just care about getting to class and coming back to nap. Gotta respect it!
To those I left out, don’t feel unseen. You’re too hard to figure out and don’t fit in with the masses. Keep being original :)
