On Beyoncé’s latest single, the phrase “7/11” takes on an entirely new meaning: being fresh is a full-time job. With the Platinum Edition reissue of the 2013 bombshell “Beyoncé,” Queen Bey has released a new single that is simultaneously disarming and calculated.
The track is hip-hop-driven, propelled by a trap percussive beat and a funky vocal rhythm. The relatively straightforward opening verses simply describe the singer’s actions—she swings side to side, smacks “it” in the air (“it” being ambiguous), claps, and spins. The single’s music video makes great use of these descriptions, showing Beyoncé performing these actions with pep, often accompanied by backup dancers. After a little more than a minute of this, however, the song moves into a slightly more aggressive register with a double-time feel and more textured beats. Shouts of “drank” and wordless Nicki-Minaj-style screams are sprinkled behind lyrics about alcohol and rolling dice. The beat is infectious—this section compels one to start dancing, if only because Beyoncé tells the listener that she “[knows] you thinkin’ ’bout alcohol.”
After this bridge, the track returns to the same trap/hip-hop mixture of the first section before launching into a slightly slower, calmer outro that gestures towards winding down after a night out. Beyoncé asserts herself as she crows a drawn-out “fresher than you,” followed by a laugh. The emotions here are less frantic than those of the opening of the track, with lyrics that are more varied. A sense of control and comfortability comes through, and the calm finish complements the track’s initial burst of energy.
There are moments during “7/11” that mesh well with the sound of the “Beyoncé” album as a whole—the final section, for example, evokes the same swaggering feel of “Drunk in Love,” with Beyoncé’s lilting delivery of “Sweatin’ out my blow out / sweatin’ out my press.” But mostly, this piece stands alone as a fun, bouncing party song, which fits well with the filming style of the music video. It’s refreshing to dance around to a track that seems to be aware of how seemingly conventional it is—Beyoncé’s use of autotune is definitely not a mistake. It’s a calculated move. She knows what she’s doing, just as she indicates with the lyrics: “Clap, clap, clap like you don’t care / I know you care.” As much as we pretend to be cool and cynical, Beyoncé knows that, at the end of the day, we very much do care about having fun.
“Beyoncé: Platinum Edition” was released on Nov. 24 via Parkwood/Columbia.

The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Frank Wedekind’s “Spring Awakening,” which ran in the Loeb Ex from Nov. 14 to Nov. 22 and was translated and directed by kat baus ’15, was a piece that inspired mixed emotions. On the one hand, it was well staged and delicately acted; the text itself is a significant milestone in theater history, marking a strong effort to depart from the strictures that 19th-century Protestant propriety placed on art. On the other hand, set against those not insignificant virtues was the impression that the actual text of “Spring Awakening” is not a very good play qua play.
A group of schoolchildren undergo the trials of late childhood and early adolescence; Moritz (Colin A. Mark ’17) is struggling with school, his nascent sexuality, and his place in the universe. His friend Melchior (Samuel A. Hagen ’18) thinks that he has the answers: he is an atheist and is already aware of the mechanics of reproduction, and so he helpfully writes his friend a 20-page essay titled “Coitus.” Nevertheless, Moritz’s inner distress continues to mount. In the meantime, Melchior cedes control to his baser instincts, raping and impregnating the innocent Wendla (Elana P. Simon ’18). Bad things continue to happen without interruption for the rest of the play.
The acting was generally superb and without a doubt the highlight of the production. Hagen played Melchior with a subtlety that made one almost forget the tortured, implausible melodrama that permeated the play. The character’s absurdity (it cannot be denied that a 13-year-old nihilist is absurd) was rendered with understatement: it would be easy (and a mistake) to treat Melchior’s existential statements as unmixed high tragedy. Instead, Hagen spoke them with childlike sincerity, and this was why the audience could still love Melchior more than any other character. Although he is a philosophical pessimist, an amoral agent, and a rapist, he is still naïve. We cannot hate Melchior any more than we can hate a lion or a bull elephant: he does terrible things, but he does them without moral knowledge. When he tells Moritz that there is no god, we cannot take him more seriously than we take a child who tells us about the squirrels in the park.
Mark’s Moritz was also worthy of note. His simple angst played well against the uncomplicated self-confidence of Melchior, and his emergence in the final scene was effective and unsettling. The only false note in his performance was his extended monologue before the end of the play’s first half, which, though overwrought, also managed to be very dull. This cannot be laid solely at his feet, however: it is difficult to see how this monologue could have been played another way.
Indeed, most of the flaws of this production were attributable to flaws in Wedekind’s vision, which was beyond the control of any member of the cast or staff. The story is one damned thing after another. Scenes that are devoid of narrative or symbolic significance are interspersed throughout the general arc of Melchior’s decline in fortunes, notably an extended masturbation scene featuring a character who is wholly irrelevant to any of the major action, Hansy (Leonie A. Oostrom ’15). It is silly to insist on the classical unities, but there is something to be said for avoiding scenes that add nothing, even tangentially, to the plot. Indeed, an uncharitable critic might say that Wedekind often seems to be seeking nothing more sophisticated that puerile shock.
If baus had decided to adapt more freely, to make it a more stylized work like that of the German Expressionists who in many respects followed Wedekind’s footsteps, perhaps this incoherence would be more forgivable. Unfortunately, the original text of “Spring Awakening” never seemed to leave the uncomfortable no-man’s land between stylization, with its unlikely and even ridiculous dramatic development and climax, and realism, with its reliance on the subtlety of character performance for its emotional effect. A more interventionist interpretation on baus’s part would have been compelled to depart significantly, and perhaps fundamentally, from the original work.
Artistic freedom is a generally accepted good, and few would advocate a return to archaic obscenity laws. However, it is an unhappy state of affairs when “free” art is as bad or worse than “unfree” art, a state of affairs that raises the question of whether or not an art piece is worthy of praise and celebration solely because it champions freedom. In the case of “Spring Awakening,” which fell flat in spite of a deft treatment, one must be inclined to say that it is not.

The opening of “Hood Billionaire,” Rick Ross’s newest album, is an imagined multi-million-dollar drug deal arranged via collect call from prison. “Intro,” this conversation-turned-opening-track, is an appropriate start to the album, since it’s about as clichéd and brazen as the rest of the material on “Hood Billionaire.”
The star-studded “Hood Billionaire” is Ross’s second album in a year, featuring collaborations with the likes of Jay-Z, R. Kelly, and Snoop Dogg. But despite its celebrity power, it seems too familiar, a dragging 16-track extension of Ross’s previous work. Rapping gangster platitudes over tired beats, Ross simply struggles to add something new to his repertoire.
“Mastermind,” Ross’ first album from 2014, was an hour-long gloat about drug money, bling, and women. In it, Ross solidified his gangsta character, but another hour of the same material on “Hood Billionaire” seems like overkill.
A rapper’s image is often dependent on street cred, from Lil Wayne’s arrests to Chief Keef’s gang affiliations. But Ross—whose real name is William Roberts and whose only time in prison was spent working as a correctional officer—has always had difficulty with building the believable criminal persona he wants to inhabit. He anticipates this challenge on the album: “Ross is a boss because real bosses don’t go to jail,” goes one line on “Movin’ Bass.” However, his insecurities over his sparse criminal past are evident in the hyperbolic and predictable lyrics of “Hood Billionaire.”
Take “Neighborhood Drug Dealer,” for example—perhaps the most blatantly straightforward track on the album. Ross triumphantly declares, “I’m your neighborhood drug dealer / it’s your neighborhood drug dealer” on repeat, as if he knows it will take a lot of work to convince us of his illicit profession. But Ross’s lack of subtlety is anything but convincing: he comes off like a newcomer to the game, loudly telling the world about his edgy and lucrative job.
This signature flagrancy is found throughout “Hood Billionaire,” notably on “Coke Like the ’80s,” the album’s third track. Unsurprisingly (for anyone who has seen the song’s title), Ross wants listeners to know he sells high-quality product reminiscent of cocaine’s golden age. Of course, in a pattern similar to “Neighborhood Drug Dealer,” the phrase “I’ve got coke like the ’80s” is stated innumerable times throughout the song. The track is brimming with overused stereotypes, from Ross bragging about his white Mercedes to describing how he eliminated anonymous business rivals.
Luckily, both “Neighborhood Drug Dealer” and “Coke Like the ’80s” are saved by a catchy, albeit standard, trap beat. “Neighborhood Drug Dealer” and “Hood Billionaire,” the album’s second track, are accentuated with deceptively attractive melodies, and it’s easy to find their refrains stuck in your head. These songs don’t put enough forward to become stand-alone hits, but may help the album achieve some commercial success. Unfortunately, the album’s catchiness dies with those three songs. Tracks like “Family Ties” are lacking in energy and variety, with dull lyrics placed over equally tedious, messy electronic beats.
But “Hood Billionaire” does hold a few surprises: in the midst of his gangster manifesto, Ross’s soft side occasionally peeks through. Lyrics like “I’m from a troubled home / one bedroom, didn’t have a telephone,” indicate an upsetting background to his ostentatious life. He even briefly delves into his romantic side on “If They Knew,” rapping, “I’m catchin’ feelings for her, she take away the pain.” These moments definitely don’t fit in with the tough-guy, drug-slinging persona he has tried so hard to construct, but they are passing seconds of relief that show William Roberts might be more nuanced than the Rick Ross gangsta caricature.
These honest moments are all too fleeting on “Hood Billionaire,” so what we’re left with is Rick Ross doing what he is best known for—gloating about luxury, claiming a life of crime, and constructing a clichéd persona that turns the album into disingenuous platitude and just doesn’t seem to capture the real William Roberts.

Audiences familiar with Bennett Miller know better than to expect a clichéd motivational sports film from “Foxcatcher.” Famous for his stirring interrogations into the psychology of characters, the director of “Capote” and “Moneyball” is a pro at turning genre films into anticlimactic tragedies about ambition, power, and fame. Sure enough, “Foxcatcher” is another film precisely like that, and Miller’s intention to replicate his previous success is obvious. However, while “Foxcatcher” is even darker than Miller’s two previous films, it provides no real insight into the motives and actions of its characters. Superficial in its discussion about wealth and fame, it is ultimately a mediocre work pretending to be profound.
The film revolves around the triangle between three characters: Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), a former Olympic wrestling champion who is now living on ramen and making a living by showing his medal to schoolchildren, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), Mark’s protective brother and a more experienced wrestler, and John du Pont (Steve Carell), Mark’s ridiculously rich patron and the central figure of the relationship. Du Pont initially offers a world-class facility to Mark to prepare for the upcoming 1988 Seoul Olympics, but his morbid quest for control and vanity is the focus of the whole film.
Unfortunately, the director fails to delve into du Pont’s mentality and psychological development and instead only goes into great detail about just how creepy he is. He speaks inarticulately and walks stiffly. He is obsessed with guns and ornithology. He gives weird toasts that leave everyone confused. He demands that Mark practices at midnight and during weekends, but at the same time enthusiastically invites him to get drunk and do cocaine. Many of these weird behaviors do not link to each other or help audiences understand du Pont’s psychology, but they do have a significant role in distracting from the main storyline. It seems that the screenwriters just make a list of all the strangest impulses they can think of and stuff them randomly in the script. In the end, they attribute everything du Pont does to his cantankerous, disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave), an explanation that always comes in handy for writers seeking to create a Freudian psychopath.
Du Pont could have been a much more nuanced character: born with a prominent family name, he has been flattered and protected throughout his life, has never had the chance to really learn anything, and is not experienced enough to be brave, sociable, or independent. When he becomes aware that people respect him only for his money, he is plunged into a futile struggle to find his identity. On one hand, he wants to get rid of the superficial aura of fortune and be recognized for his true talent and virtue; on the other hand, at the painful realization of how weak and inept he actually is, he flees and hides behind his money, using it as his weapon against the world as he has always done. Clearly, the writers had this in mind when they worked on the outline of the story, as the first aspect of this struggle is the motive for du Pont to subsidize the Schultz brothers, and the second creates the struggle between him and the two. However, when they should have elaborated upon this notion with great detail, they only made him a stereotypical weirdo. The same mistake happens to the depiction of the ever reticent and cantankerous Mark, who turns out to suffer from the childhood trauma of parental divorce, another convenient and unimaginative excuse to be a creep.
Nevertheless, as flawed as the script is, the actors still give a performance that is both brilliant and sometimes even credible (a huge feat considering the weakness of the story). Carell, totally unrecognizable, immerses himself completely in his paranoid character. When he becomes unreasonably aggressive, there is always a hint of sour humiliation in his demeanor, and when he seems to crash, his eyes still shine with ambition and arrogance. Moreover, Tatum shows his maturation as an actor, which make his two-dimensional role much more natural. However, even they could not save the film or hide the imperfections of the script.
In “Foxcatcher,” almost every character has some Freudian trauma, almost every minute tries to be dark, and almost every line desperately tries to remind audiences that they are watching a serious drama about the complexity of humanity. However, these efforts only serve to demonstrate that the profundity of a film is not proportional to the madness of the characters—a great theme can be easily destroyed by crude and unconvincing execution.

After the critical and commercial success of the 2011 comedy “Horrible Bosses,” Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis return for a sequel, released on Nov. 26. “Horrible Bosses 2” picks up where its predecessor left off, with Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis reprising their roles from the original film as three friends who—now free from their oppressive bosses from the first film—plan to start a small business together. Hijinks ensue when the friends, on the verge of bankruptcy, hatch an outrageous plan to kidnap the son of a wealthy businessman who had previously swindled them.
Following the first film’s release and high international gross, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were contacted regarding production of a potential sequel. “Warner Brothers wanted to do another one, and we were certainly open to it because we had such a good time doing the first one,” Bateman said. Despite the first film’s financial success, the three actors wanted to ensure that the sequel lived up to original’s creative ambitions. “Jason and Jason and myself had a lot of lengthy conversations about what the second story could be, and we weren’t going to do a movie if we couldn’t find a story that, for us, made sense,” Day added.
Director Seth Gordon was also scheduled to return for the sequel but departed due to scheduling conflicts, so Sean Anders (“Sex Drive”) stepped in as director and rewrote the script with collaborator John Morris. The two also worked as writers on “We’re the Millers,” a 2013 comedy starring Sudeikis as a marijuana dealer who assembles a fake family to smuggle two tons of drugs across the border from Mexico in an RV. “I think they did a great job with the rewriting of ‘Horrible,’ ‘We’re the Millers’—so it’s like having two other writers on set with us,” Sudeikis said. “There’s a whole chunk in the middle where it almost looks like a Steven Soderbergh film…. Even the stuff of us starting the business, you know, all those visual elements to it feel like a Fincher movie. It’s like something right out of ‘Fight Club.’” Day agreed that the film stands out from typical comedies by exploring a multitude of aesthetics. “When it makes sense with the film to get a little more stylized, [Anders] put a little more style…and it fits the story,” Day said.
The three actors are also joined by an ensemble cast featuring actors from the original film—Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey reprising their roles as Dean “Motherfucker” Jones, Dr. Julia Harris, and David Harken—as well as Christoph Waltz, Chris Pine, Jonathan Banks, and Keegan-Michael Key playing new characters. “This is a big kind of silly commercial studio comedy, and when you can class it up with some Oscar winners it becomes a really nice balanced cocktail,” Bateman said. Sudeikis also expressed enthusiasm over the diversity of comedic talent added to the sequel. “Jonathan Banks is in one of my favorite movies of all time, ‘Beverly Hills Cop.’ And so to be in a movie with him is awesome,” Sudeikis said. “And I’ve known Keegan forever—there’s a lot of Second City people in this movie.”
With a larger cast and big-budget effects, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis all agreed that “Horrible Bosses 2” was a fun project to return to—though there’s no word yet on potentially turning this franchise into a trilogy. “As actors, it was really fun for the three of us to get back together again because we enjoy each other’s company and we had this great time in the first one,” Day said. “As characters, it’s a terrible thing for the three of these people to get back together again because they keep getting themselves into some serious trouble.”

Today’s animated films are cute. From the wholly unnecessary “Cars 2” to the “Despicable Me” franchise that spawned a thousand merchandising lines and a spin-off prequel, modern animated children’s films generally boast similar aesthetics of large eyes, disproportionately sized bodies, and anthropomorphized plush-doll animals. This is a tried-and-true formula, so it’s no surprise that DreamWorks’s new film “Penguins of Madagascar” follows it to the letter. The end result is a movie that is energetic and fun but ultimately indistinguishable from most entries in the genre.
Initially a direct-to-video film, “Penguins” features the familiar Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (Conrad Vernon), and Private (Christopher Knights), characters from the “Madagascar” film trilogy and the stars of the Nickelodeon television show “The Penguins of Madagascar.” Although “Penguins” has the same name as the television show, it actually takes place after “Madagascar 3” and in a different timeline than the show.
“Penguins” adopts a fast pace from its opening scene—an action-filled flashback that introduces the childhood friendship between Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico (and eventually Private)—and manages to maintain this level of frenetic energy throughout. Much of the film’s lively 3D action sequences are bolstered by Tom McGrath’s excellent voice performance, and McGrath’s delivery meshes well with that of Benedict Cumberbatch, who voices the character Classified. He serves as the leader of a high-tech military squad of animals named the North Wind, composed of Short Fuse (Ken Jeong), Eva (Annet Mahendru), and Corporal (Peter Stormare). Whereas the penguins are a bumbling group of lovable idiots, the North Wind is a tightly run organization complete with a secret base, a hovercraft, jet packs, and rocket launchers. Needless to say, the two teams don’t initially get along.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that the penguins have been accidentally embroiled in a conflict with Dave (John Malkovich), an octopus driven mad with jealousy at being overshadowed by penguins in every zoo he’s resided in. Much like in “Despicable Me 2,” Dave concocts a serum that will mutate penguins across the world, but instead of pursuing world domination, Dave simply wants to make them repulsive to humans. In a light-hearted animated film where the stakes aren’t very high, much of the dramatic tension comes from the audience’s implicit desire to preserve the cuteness of the penguins. Nonetheless, the film derives much heart from the relationship between Private and Skipper. Found by the other three penguins as an egg at the film’s beginning, the younger Private has always felt underappreciated as a member of their team—a problem that compounds the ongoing conflicts with Dave and the North Wind.
“Penguins” does manage to pack in some impressive visuals—directors Simon J. Smith and Eric Darnell fit in numerous flashy action sequences that flout the laws of physics and demonstrate the film’s superior visual effects compared to the show. Frenzied chase sequences have the surreal quality of “Tom and Jerry” cartoons, interspersed with witty dialogue between the penguins. The script, partly co-written by McGrath and Darnell, packs in clever one-liners aimed at astute children as well as their parents. Of particular note are the non-stop celebrity puns spouted by Malkovich’s character, as every line he utters seems to contain some deliberately roundabout turn of phrase that is homophonous with some celebrity’s name—for instance, “Drew, Barry—more power!”
While “Penguins” ultimately proves to be inoffensively charming family fare, it fails to achieve the depth of most Pixar films or previous DreamWorks hits like “How to Train Your Dragon.” However, the film comes from a franchise built on megalomaniacal anthropomorphized animals and is aware of its shortcomings. Watching the film is like a high-budget throwback to Saturday morning cartoons of years past, the kind that were packed with nonsensical plotlines that nonetheless remained engaging throughout. “Penguins” doesn’t seek to be praised; it simply exists to entertain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students joined thousands of Boston community members in a city-wide rally Tuesday evening to protest a grand jury’s decision to not indict a police officer in the death of a black teenager in Missouri.
Boston’s rally, which was organized by community organization Black Lives Matter Boston, was one of ten affiliated rallies which occurred in cities across the U.S. to protest the controversial decision.
The St. Louis County grand jury announced Monday night that it would not charge police officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.. The shooting, which took place in August, has sparked sometimes violent protests and national media scrutiny over the circumstances of Brown’s death, the police response to subsequent riots in Ferguson, and more broadly, race relations in the U.S.
Dozens of Harvard students participated in the rally, both individually and in small groups. While some opted to take public transportation, student leaders of the Philip Brooks House Association organized drivers to transport about 50 students to the rally in the organization’s vans.
The rally began in front of a police station in Roxbury, a predominantly black and low-income neighborhood in Boston. Many of Harvard’s participating students wore clothing with the Harvard name and logo, holding signs with messages such as “We at Harvard Stand with Michael Brown” and “The Progressive Jewish Alliance Stands in Solidarity with Mike Brown.” They were joined by college students from other local universities, including Boston University and MIT.
As the night progressed, participants marched towards South Bay, with some pausing to chant, “No justice, no peace!” as they passed the South Bay House of Corrections, prompting inmates to cheer from behind barred windows. The protesters ultimately dispersed after police officers blocked their entrance to the I-93 highway.
Cornelius Lee Jr., a Graduate School of Design student who participated in the rally, said he felt it was necessary for Harvard students to attend and represent Harvard and other elite institutions, which have not always been inclusive of minority groups.
Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, political action chair of the Black Student Association and another rally participant, concurred. She said that while Harvard students should not come with a mindset of “saving anybody” or minimizing the voices of the affected communities, she believed Harvard students ought to leverage the institution’s name to advocate change.
“Harvard has a lot of power, politically, economically, socially—and so if we continue to benefit off of it, we might as well use it as a platform for people who don’t have that privilege,” Wigglesworth said.
Yet some students chose not to attend the rally.
Jaime A. Cobham ’17, brotherhood co-chair of the Black Men’s Forum, said that although he had attended several rallies to protest the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin, he no longer had the “emotional energy” to attend a rally.
“I don’t know if it’s going to change what people think, and I don’t know if anything will come out of it,” Cobson said, adding that he does not believe that rallies serve no purpose or that people should not organize or attend them.
Besides participating in the rally, Harvard community members gathered and engaged in conversations this week about the grand jury’s decision.
Memorial Church was open Tuesday afternoon so people could gather and “pray silently and think imaginatively in order that we might ultimately protest courageously,” according to a press release. In addition, race relations tutors in undergraduate Houses scheduled open discussions on the decision, and student groups and offices such as the Office of BGLTQ Student Life expressed sentiments of solidarity.
Both Wigglesworth and Cobson said that members of their groups, BSA and BMF, respectively, were upset by the decision.
According to Wigglesworth, BSA plans to release a statement responding to the decision in the coming days, and she said she anticipates the group will hold related events after Thanksgiving break. She said some group members have already chosen to boycott Black Friday to protest economic injustice against black communities or companies who she said supported the “prison-industrial complex”—all actions the BSA would advocate for.
Cobson said that while BMF has not finalized their response, it plans to take yet-unspecified actions to raise awareness on campus and provide a space for its members to process their feelings about the decision.
Wigglesworth added, however, that she hopes groups outside the black community would take action and reflect on the decision.
“This is everybody’s problem,” Wigglesworth said. “I hope this school realizes that this isn’t a black issue, and if you see only black people speaking on the issue, call on that, and question [that].”
