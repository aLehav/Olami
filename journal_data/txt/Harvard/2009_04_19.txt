Going all-in? Not likely, if you gamble online.A recent study conducted by the Harvard Medical School Division on Addictions suggests that the widespread availability of Internet gambling has not led to an increase in the number of people addicted to gambling.The study actually found that gamblers who visit gaming Web sites are more likely to self-regulate their betting behavior based on their pattern of wins and losses. Those who are addicted to gambling do not exhibit such control.The study began in February 2005 and observed 3,445 subscribers to BWIN, an Austria-based gaming Web site. The participants’ poker outcomes were analyzed over the course of two years, and the number of chips they bought and sold per session was tallied. The study, which investigated online gambling as “a potential object of addictive behavior,” concluded that the availability of Internet gambling is not correlated to gambling addiction.“The very first thing we learned, which we didn’t expect, was that the vast majority, the overwhelming majority, of gamblers online gamble in a very moderate and mild way,” said HMS Associate Professor of Psychology Howard Shaffer in an interview with Gambling Online Magazine.Approximately 95 percent of players studied only bought a median of about $15.65 in chips at two poker sessions per week.“A minority of most involved players did not show such moderation,” the study noted. The remaining 5 percent of players studied bet in excess, buying a median of $116.13 in chips at 10 sessions per week.Although the number of people participating in online gambling is contested, the study showed that the percentage of problem gamblers has barely changed since the 1970s, hovering around 0.6 percent of the United States population. Andrew M. Woods, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Global Poker Strategic Thinking Society, said he did not find the results of the study surprising.He asserted that poker is less like gambling and more like “risk assessment.”According to Woods, other casino games, such as blackjack, have a built-in advantage towards the house, making it less likely for players to win money.“There is no house in poker, so no one is guaranteed to win,” Woods said. “Poker exercises your ability to make good decisions,” he said, reflecting on the mild betting habits of online players.

Amidst public outrage over Facebook.com’s storage of user information on its server, Facebook has recently encouraged its users to vote on possible changes to the Web site’s terms of service. In a post on the company’s blog on Thursday, Facebook CEO and founder Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06-’07 explained that if more than 30 percent of Facebook’s 200 million active users voted on the proposals, all of Facebook’s future amendments would go through the same voting process.Users have been given the option to either maintain Facebook’s current terms of service or to amend the document by taking into consideration users’ complaints and criticisms. Voting has been in progress since April 16, and will continue until Thursday, April 23.According to Zuckerberg’s stipulations, nearly 70 million users would need to vote on the two proposals in order to achieve the 30 percent quota.But as of 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, only about 275,000 users had voted, with the proposal to amend the current terms of service leading by a 3-1 margin.“I saw the announcement at the top of my page, and I have yet to sit down and read them carefully and think about how they are going to affect how I will use Facebook,” said Lisa S. Rotenstein ’11.   Although it appears that the poll will not draw the necessary amount of votes, Zuckerberg wrote on his blog that “even if these new proposed documents are defeated, we will still find ways to involve you in the governance process.”  Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor at the Law School and co-founder of the school’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society noted on his blog on Friday that the voting threshold is high, and the company has added barriers to participation—users must add a Facebook application in order to vote—that may also contribute to a low voter turnout.Zittrain also noted that the company did not specify what changes would be made to the terms of service even if the 30 percent threshold is reached. Facebook still retains the power to ultimately determine the details of user terms of service.“Facebook still holds the quill and frames [of] the choice. But the fact is that most companies wouldn’t dream of going as far as Facebook just has,” Zittrain wrote.Although the vote may not reach the 30 percent quota, Zittrain wrote, “I’m heartened at the prospect that the amazing engine of private enterprise may find creative ways to tap into and reinforce our civic instincts.”

CBS News’ Chief Foreign Correspondent Lara Logan visited Kirkland House on Friday afternoon for an intimate talk about her decades-long career as a journalist.The event, hosted in the Kirkland Masters’ residence, is part of the House’s speaker-series, “Conversations with Kirkland.”Logan, who is currently a correspondent for 60 Minutes and CBS Evening News with Katie Couric, focused on several events in her life that she said have shaped the way she reports.The South African-born journalist stressed the importance of her upbringing during the apartheid era, comparing the period to the time during the American Constitution’s formation. “I saw what it really means to fight for democracy,” she said. “The lessons were so bloody.”Logan began writing for the Sunday Tribune, a South Africa-based paper, at the age of 17. In 1992, she began her career in TV journalism as a senior producer for Reuters Television.But Logan spoke candidly about aspects of reporting for television that she said still concern her.“The great challenge of TV reporting is to take the full scope of an event and condense it,” Lara reflected. “The simplest [sic] you make a story the less you know, and that’s worthless to me.”As a reporter during conflicts such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Logan said that she has had to balance being a woman with her professional responsibilities.She recounted a time when her hotel was bombed and before going on air Logan, who repeatedly called herself “feminine,” said that she took the time to put on makeup and clothing appropriate for reporting from an Arabic nation.“I’ve never been to war without lipgloss,” she said.About halfway through the event, the conversation veered away from war reporting to a discussion about the complications of attractiveness in the journalism business. In a Washington Post profile last year, Logan, who recently re-married in Nov. 2008, complained that her life was being reduced to “tabloid fodder.” And at Kirkland on Friday, she acknowledged that while she has attracted undue attention because of her blonde hair and good looks, she wants to be judged based on the quality of her work.“Being a journalist is an extension of what I believe,” she said.

Former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky read six of his poems at the Harvard Advocate on Friday, accompanied by New England Conservatory senior Andrew Urbina on alto sax and by NEC professor “Rakalam” Bob Moses on percussion.The sounds of Urbina’s alto sax and Moses’ percussion were interspersed with Pinsky’s poetry. At times, the poet danced a little to the music as he read, and at other times, he  remained silent for minutes as Moses and Urbina performed. “It’s all about listening to one another,” Pinsky said of the collaboration. “We really love working together. It’s insane how much we love working together.”“You’re just an excuse,” he added jokingly to the audience.After each selection, Pinsky paused to speak with Urbina and Moses about how to proceed, giving the whole affair an impromptu feel.“The improvisational style of the music unlocked the internal energy of the poem,” said The Advocate’s president Sanders I. Bernstein ’10, who is also a Crimson Arts writer. “Pinsky and Rakalam both played off each other, the music responding to the fixed, internal rhythms of the poem and the words being given new depth by the music. What the improvisation did was that it unlocked the essence of the poem.”Pinsky served as the 39th U.S. poet laureate from 1997 to 2000. He has published nineteen books of poetry, prose, and translations.Adam L. Palay ’11, a member of the Advocate and the event’s organizer, said that the reading was a change from those usually held at the Advocate, as the organization usually holds more intimate readings by authors and poets, rather than collaborations between literary figures and musicians.“We usually don’t have a performance like that,” he said. “So I think it’s really great to do something different.”The poet performed six poems that ranged from recently-published pieces, such as “Last Robot Song” and “Samurai Song,” to some that were penned  in the 1990’s, like “The Wanted Bone” and “Ginza Samba.” Of Ginza Samba, Pinsky said that he likes the “eclectic nature of the American culture” that is conferred by the poem’s title. Ginza refers to an area of Tokyo, while the multicultural Brazilian music genre Samba, which also rings of African religion, culture and dance.Palay said he invited Pinsky to the reading partly because he remembered being impressed by hearing the former poet laureate read during high school. “I just like the way he reads more than anything. He’s a good poet, too, and just a great person to have,” he said.

A suspected outbreak of mumps at Northeastern University has forced at least nine students to seek medical attention. 
Each student has demonstrated various symptoms of the illness, which include headaches, muscle pain, vomiting, and the swelling of salivary glands that leave some victims resembling chipmunks. 
While one student has been hospitalized, Northeastern has asked that the remaining infected students stay away from large crowds and, if possible, remain in their dormitories, according to an article in the Boston Globe.
“[University Health and Counseling Services] is working closely with state and city public health officials to make sure members of the community are informed and safe,” Northeastern wrote in a statement released on Friday. 
Northeastern has also asked students to notify potential guests for its looming commencement services in less than two weeks, a move that could suggest that the epidemic is far from being controlled.
Despite the outbreak across the river, epidemic specialists at Harvard’s University Health Services say they are comfortable that its current health policies will prevent an infection at Harvard. 
“Anyone who goes to school here must be vaccinated,” said UHS Infection Control Surveillance Nurse Susan Fitzgerald. “We get documentation from everyone who starts school—you can’t register without it.”
According to the Boston Globe, officials at Northeastern say that “99 percent” of its students have also received the required vaccination as mandated by Massachusetts law. The University is offering free shots to the remaining one percent on campus. 
However, immunization does not guarantee an epidemic-free community. 
Soheyla Gharib, chief of medicine at UHS, said that Northeastern became infected when two previously-vaccinated students returned from a spring break vacation in Ireland, where cases of mumps have hit a record high for the country. 
Boston Public Health officials maintain that even with proper immunization, there is still a 10-20 percent chance of infection. 
“The probability that [students] in the community will be infected is very low,” Gharib said. “We’re not worried about this touching off a rash of mumps.”

At 10 a.m. on a Friday morning, City Councillor Larry W. Ward walks into Au Bon Pain wearing a sweatshirt, workout pants, and Crocs. He’s already been to the gym and had a cup of coffee, so he orders a peach iced tea and strikes up a conversation with the cashier, a young man he recognizes.“It’s good to see you working,” he says, “This job looks good on you.”During the 2007 election, Ward lost a bid for a council seat. But following the February resignation of Vice Mayor Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87, Ward was appointed to the Council in a special recount, becoming the nine-person body’s third black member.Trained as a guidance counselor and having more than a decade of involvement in Cambridge Youth Soccer under his belt, Ward considers his ability to connect with people one of his primary assets. But because he joined the Council only eight months before the upcoming November election, Ward has yet to simultaneously catch up on City governance and reignite his once-failed campaign.In the month since he was sworn in, Ward has sponsored two resolutions and been appointed chairman of the University Relations committee, replacing Murphy. He assumes the post at a time when the Council has been repeatedly criticizing Harvard and MIT for laying off low-income employees. But despite the current relevance of that position, he has not yet carved a distinct niche for himself on the Council.UNIVERSITY RELATIONSWard said that he would like to see less adversarial relationships between Cambridge and universities such as Harvard and MIT—ones that focus on the non-monetary resources the universities provide the city.“A lot of value is added to the city from [Harvard], but often times, that is overshadowed by the fact that it is not tax-based,” Ward said.In March, City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker proposed granting Harvard a “mini-stimulus package” that would relieve the university of a portion of its Payment in Lieu of Taxes—also known as a PILOT payment—equal to the total annual salaries of subcontracted janitorial employees who had recently been laid off. The measure, intended to shame Harvard into backing off from layoffs, has since been tabled.Last week, Ward co-sponsored another resolution, calling on Harvard and MIT to request “concessions from employees at all levels” before laying off low-income employees, a measure that was unanimously approved.Ward said that universities can play an important role in helping their home cities during difficult financial times. For example, he said, if cities are forced to cut library services, the universities should open their libraries to the public.LIVE, WORK, OR PLAYAndrew Farrar, Ward’s campaign manager and adviser, listed Ward’s accomplishments thus far: the new councillor has promoted a family-oriented focus for the city during his time on the Council. Ward also considered proposing a bill that would protect families facing foreclosure, Farrar said. In addition, he cited Ward’s involvement in mediating parking negotiations between residents of subsidized housing and Harvard realty.Ward has also discussed solutions for balancing the city’s goals for development and open space.“People who live here bought property under one set of assumptions. Over time, things change but those assumptions don’t,” Ward said.When asked whether he had any specific policy focus for his time on the council, Ward said, “My goal is, whether people live, work, or play here, they should feel good about being in Cambridge.”Ward may already have established himself enough to inspire worry among his colleagues, according to Harvard Extension School professor and local political pundit Robert Winters, who maintains a blog about Cambridge politics.“Marjorie Decker sees [Ward] as a threat,” Winters said. “[The other councillors] will do everything they can to try to make him feel awkward and make him stumble,” he added.ROAD TO CITY HALLWard has lived in Cambridge since 1989. Originally from Alexandria, Virginia, he played football for T.C. Williams High School under coach Herman Boone of “Remember the Titans” fame before going on to Boston University. He was the first in his family to graduate from college, and went on to earn a Masters in education from Maryland University and a Ph.D. in Rehabilitation Services from Boston University.Before he assumed the concillor position, Ward was a guidance counselor and the owner of a business that brings computer labs to centers for the elderly, He became involved in community activities such as volunteering for Cambridge Youth Soccer soon after moving to the city.He met Farrar when their daughters were on the same soccer team more than a decade ago. In 2006, the two men first discussed Ward’s plans to run for City Council together over coffee.“I decided that I really wanted to be a part of helping shape the growth of the city,” Ward said in an interview. “To do that, you have to run for office, so I ran.”Although his initial bid for a spot in 2007 on the council was unsuccessful, Ward got a second chance when Murphy vacated his seat to work for the state’s Executive Office of Transportation.In accordance with Cambridge’s proportional representation election system, the city’s election commission reviewed the ballots that were awarded to Murphy in the 2007 election and chose as his replacement the eligible candidate who had next highest ranking.Ward filled that vacancy, and was sworn in as a city councillor on March 3.THE PROSPECT OF RE-ELECTIONThere is little down time for the new councillor, for Ward and his advisors have already begun planning for their next campaign in November.“After the election, there is [usually] a year-long period in which to work out a relationship with the other councillors, [but Ward] doesn’t have that advantage,” Farrar said. “Everyone is trying to carve out their territory and area of focus, so he doesn’t have an interim period in which to be acclimated.” Winters said that in his experience observing the Council, the job performance of councillors has little to do with their chances of re-election. More important, he said, is a candidate’s ability to portray himself as the strongest representative of the interests of a particular group.Although he called Ward’s approach to his first month on the council “tentative,” Winters said that he still has time to position himself as a strong presence on the Council.“Right now, Larry’s stumbling,” Winters said, “But so did Anthony [Gallucio], and now he’s a state senator.”—Staff writer Danella H.

Having already clinched a share of the EIVA Hay Division and in search of an outright title, the players on the Harvard men’s volleyball team (11-7, 6-2 EIVA Hay) set out to Newark, N.J., on Friday night to claim sole possession of its division’s top honors. Instead, the Crimson traveled home after being dealt a crushing 3-0 (30-28, 30-25, 30-23) loss from league rival Rutgers-Newark (9-13, 6-2).“Rutgers-Newark was a really good team and they were ready to go,” senior Jeff Nathan said. “They came off right at the very beginning and never looked back.”Earlier last week, co-captain Brady Weissbourd broke his finger in practice while Nathan, a crucial player at the libero position, sprained his ankle. With a depleted roster, the team’s performance on the offensive side was hampered, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time.The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for Harvard but ended a seven-game skid for Rutgers-Newark. And while the Crimson and the Scarlet Pioneers split the division title, the loss gave Rutgers-Newark the edge in a tie-breaker, allowing the team to claim the top seed in the upcoming EIVA Conference Championship. Harvard will enter the postseason as the second team representing the Hay Division.“Going in, I felt that we knew what we had to do,” freshman Matt Jones said. “I feel like what might have happened was that because we’ve beat them before, and we were on this streak, we underestimated how strong they were going to come out of play. ”The Crimson found itself in a 14-8 deficit early in the first set. After calling a timeout, Harvard received an offensive spark with kills from junior Erik Kuld and Jones keeping the opening set close at 18-16. But a combination of careless service errors and attack errors made it tough for the Crimson to win over a scrappy Pioneers team that played well on both sides of the ball. With Rutgers-Newark barely hanging on to a 29-28 lead, a kill by junior Kenneth Stambaugh gave the first set to the home team.“I think that they serve the ball really well,” Nathan said. “As a unit, we didn’t pass particularly well, so that definitely was a contributing factor.”While struggles to pass and establish an offensive presence would prove to be the Achilles’ heel for Harvard throughout the game, it was the superb serving from Rutgers-Newark that would be the story of the day. In just three sets, the Pioneers racked up ten service aces, and the Crimson simply had no answer for its opponent.“Anytime a team serves you ten services aces, that’s eight points they have on you right there,” Jones said. “I personally got aced four times. As a result, we didn’t pass particularly well and they hit pretty well.”The Crimson’s offensive troubles would continue just as the Scarlet Pioneers began to warm up. In the second set, Rutgers-Newark found its offensive rhythm, and fine-tuned it to a hitting percentage of .453, with just three errors. Senior Kenny Rienecker led the way with five kills, and the Pioneers went on to take the second set 30-25. Harvard posted a respectable .250 hitting percentage, totaling 11 kills, but Rutgers-Newark was simply on top of its game, limiting Weissbourd’s damage to just nine kills on the night.“After the first game, we were close, but we could never match [Rutgers-Newark],” Jones said. “They just came to outplay us the whole night.”By the third set, it became clear who wanted—and needed—the victory more. An early 4-4 tie kept Harvard within striking distance, but the Scarlet Pioneers would not relent their strong offensive showing, extending a 19-11 lead after yet another service ace by junior Jon Keller. The lead would widen to nine at 23-14 as senior Nate Stott contributed two service aces of his own. Just when it appeared that the Crimson was ready to concede defeat, however, Harvard found itself down just four, 25-21, after a kill from Kuld and several attack errors from Rutgers-Newark gave the Crimson another chance to come back.But a timeout from the Scarlet Pioneers would disrupt Harvard’s momentum, and Rutgers-Newark would cruise to a 30-23 victory after registering 15 kills to just five errors in the third set. Meanwhile, the Crimson finished the set hitting a dismal .045 to go along with seven errors.“Anytime that you can’t pass well, it’s tough to get the offense going,” Jones said. —Staff writer Kevin T.

Before Saturday’s game against Columbia, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team honored seniors Sarah Bancroft, Shannon Flynn, Kaitlin Martin, and Catriona Stewart in their last college lacrosse game at Harvard Stadium. After the game, a crowd dominated by the Lions was wildly celebrating Columbia’s only Ivy League win of the season after the visitors scored with 39.9 seconds left to win 11-10. “We were really disappointed with the outcome,” junior tri-captain Sara Flood said. “We typically beat Columbia, and it’s always a must-win on our schedule. I think they just came in really wanting an Ivy win…they’ve really been struggling in the Ivy League, so they were really pumped.” It had been four years since the Lions (7-6, 1-5 Ivy League) defeated the Crimson (4-10, 1-5) in Cambridge, and both teams opened the game in a defensive mindset, not wanting to concede anything en route to a 4-4 halftime deadlock. Harvard opened the scoring when Flood found freshman Katie Doherty who sent one through the pipes 3:25 into play. Columbia rebounded less than a minute later to tie the game at 1-1. Freshman Tyler Petropulous and sophomore Jess Halpern both scored unassisted goals over the next three minutes to give the Crimson a 3-1 advantage with just over 23 minutes remaining in the first period. The Lions used a steady attack and efficient shooting to tie the score at 4-4 with 3:53 remaining in the first half, despite being outshot by the Crimson, 16-9. “The shots in the first half were all about the placement,” Sophomore Sam McMahon said. “We were shooting right at the goalie instead of around the goalie, and that allowed Columbia to get back in it…we gave them hope that they could come back and win it in the second half.”After the Lions opened the scoring in the second half, Doherty notched two goals in less than a minute to complete a hat trick and re-capture the lead at 6-5. Columbia responded by rattling off four straight goals in a little over three minutes to take the largest lead of the game at 9-6. Halpern broke Columbia’s scoring run, though, to pull the game within two halfway through the second half in a back-and-forth contest. “Their coach is a fighter,” Flood said. “[Harvard coach Lisa] Miller actually coached Columbia’s coach, so I’m sure [she was] excited and I’m sure she told her players to get after it hard. We’ve been having some trouble lately, and I’m sure they looked at our schedule and thought we were vulnerable.”After a lull in the action, Columbia stretched the lead back to three, giving Harvard a sense of urgency heading into the last ten minutes of the game. Petropulous scored her third and fourth goals of the contest in 48 seconds to match her career high and breathe life into the Crimson, down 10-9 with 9:13 left. Both squads played gritty and inspired defense for the next eight minutes until junior Delia Pais forced a turnover and reclaimed possession for Harvard. Pais found a streaking Halpern, who created a hat trick of her own and tied the game at 10-10 after Columbia had been leading for over 20 minutes. But with the game on the line, it was the Lions who would get the last opportunity. Although the Crimson gained six out of nine draw controls in the first period, it dropped nine of fourteen in the second, including the final draw following Halpern’s goal to set up the game-winner. “After tying it up we were really hoping that we would get the draw control,” McMahon said. “The past three possessions we had really been pressuring out and the defense just had a lapse there at the end…we definitely shouldn’t have pressed out as much on the last shot.” With many defenders out of position, Columbia’s Gabrielle Geronimos rolled the crease and hit a bounce shot to put the Lions ahead for good, securing their first conference win and extending Harvard’s losing streak to five games.“We went out there and we played hard, but the past few weeks, the little things have been costing us the game,” McMahon said. “The hustle was there, we just didn’t finish what we wanted to finish as far as details, but hopefully those things will start to fall in place.” The Crimson will seek to end its losing streak and capture its second conference win next weekend when it travels to Ithaca, N.Y. to play Cornell in both teams’ Ivy League finale.

Saturday morning marked two firsts of the season for the Radcliffe crew program, but only one of them went the Black and White’s way. The heavyweight team captured its first Cup race of the season, while the lightweights lost their first dual race to Stanford.The eights were the star boats for the No. 15 Radcliffe heavyweight crew team on Saturday morning on Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, New York and led the Black and White to victory over Syracuse and Dartmouth. The win means that the Elizabeth O’Leary Cup, named for Radcliffe heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary, will reside in Cambridge for another year.Through a lineup change during the week that moved senior Esther Lofgren to the stroke position and captain Liz Demers to the six seat, the Varsity Eight has been able to fine-tune its rhythm.“We’re really powerful, but we haven’t always been able to apply all that together. This was the first weekend where all the power was laid out,” sophomore Olivia Coffey said. “It gives our team a lot of confidence going into next weekend.”The Varsity Eight turned in a strong performance for its third win of the year, crossing the finish line with a time of 6:48.6. Both Radcliffe and the Big Green managed to get a good start, despite miscommunication between the crews and the starting officials. After staying even in the first 500 meters, the Black and White started to inch ahead. By the last 500 meters, the outcome was all but decided, and Radcliffe managed to best Dartmouth by 6.8 seconds. Syracuse finished in third place with a time of 7:09.5.“We were able to stay really internal in our boat and focus on the rhythm,” senior Sarah Moore said. “We probably had a length coming into the 1000 and just took it from there.”The Second Varsity Eight dispatched both opponents in similar style, turning in a first-place finish in 7:07.1. The closest race of the day—the Varsity Four A—did not go the Black and White’s way. Syracuse, clocking in at 7:55.2, was a mere 1.6 seconds faster than Radcliffe, which finished in second place with a time of 7:56.8.In contrast, the Varsity Four B, clocking in at 8:14.8, dominated the field in its race, which also included Black and White’s C boat. Second-place Syracuse finished a whopping 14.9 seconds behind the Radcliffe, while the team’s B boat finished in fourth.Despite a late-charge, the Black and White lightweight Varsity Eight could not prevail over the No. 3 Stanford Cardinals on Saturday morning in No. 4 Radcliffe’s first home dual-meet of the season. It was the lightweights’ first loss of the season and drops their overall record to 3-1. The Varsity Eight had to overcome an early Stanford lead that the Cardinals managed to hold going into the final 500 meters. But Radcliffe’s late charge, beginning with 350 meters left, ultimately came too late, even though the Black and White managed to close the gap from eight seat-lengths to five.“I think we came out with them at the start and then through the middle 1000, we kind of dropped off and they slowly wore us away feet by feet,” junior Grace Hollowell said. “I think we could have been more aggressive and charged hard through the middle 1000.”The Cardinals would hold on to cross the finish line with a time of 7:14.69, less than two seconds ahead of Radcliffe’s 7:16.22 finish. The Second Varsity Eight, which also competed in the race, did not manage to keep up the strenuous pace and finished in third place in 7:48.51.“I think we ran out of course,” Hollowell said. “If we had had another 100 meters, I think we would have gotten them.”Stanford dominated the novice race with a 8:22.01 finish time compared to Radcliffe’s 8:51.02.Next weekend, the lightweights will face another top national opponent, the No. 2 Princeton tigers while the heavyweights will compete in the Charles River Challenge on Saturday and Sunday.—Staff writer Robert T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing this season’s trend of consistent excellence, both Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams represented themselves well this weekend at home and afield. Both crews established themselves early on in the season as teams to beat, and have not given up their position.
This Saturday, the two crews once again demonstrated their competitive spirit, fighting respectively to maintain the heavyweight Compton Cup and the lightweight Haines Cup, honors they won last year. Both crews held onto their prizes, keeping them in Newell Boathouse for the second year in a row. 


Harvard’s varsity eight rowed a particularly strong race on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J., beating MIT and Princeton by an impressive margin of more than eight seconds. The Crimson gained a boat-length lead in the first 500 meters of the race, and steadily increased its margins throughout the next 1500 meters, leaving Princeton and MIT to fight it out in its wake. 
“We settled into a good rhythm, and we were able to move away from MIT and Princeton,” sophomore coxswain Chris Kingston said. “We were expecting Princeton to give us a fast race, but we were able to move ahead early.” 
The first varsity’s smooth victory was due in part to a newly found stability within the first boat lineup, with a rower returning from a recent injury. The ease of Harvard’s victory suggests that the Crimson has found a stride that will allow it to move ahead in future races.
Coming in second place for the first time since 1975 was the Engineers’ varsity eight, beating Princeton’s entry by a close margin of one second.
The following races were also strong performances and indicative of the overall strength of Harvard’s heavyweight program. 
“[The morning was] very encouraging, and one that gave us an opportunity to show our depth,” captain Teddy Schreck said. 
The second varsity eight finished a respectable second to the Tigers, while both the third varsity and fourth varsity beat Princeton’s third varsity eight. 
The freshmen bested the Tigers by a margin of three seconds and MIT by a margin of 15 seconds.
Harvard proved itself to be uniformly competitive, rowing well across the board. Next weekend, the heavyweights face Navy and Penn in Annapolis, Md. to compete for the Adams Cup.
Back at home, the lightweights faced more rigorous competition. Navy and Harvard met on the blustery Charles with a prevailing headwind, but the Crimson and the Midshipmen remained unfazed by the conditions. 
“The headwind slowed the times down a little, but we’re used to rowing in tough conditions and so is Navy,” captain Jeff Overington said. “It didn’t affect our rowing at all.”
The two crews found themselves closely matched in every race. 
“Navy’s always very fast, so we expected them to be a strong competitor [in the varsity races],” Overington said. 
The highly competitive first varsity race set the tone for the following contests. Navy and Harvard’s varsity eights raced down the course neck and neck until the 1000-meter mark, where the Crimson was able to gain a slight lead. The Midshipmen inched back in the following 1000 meters, but was unable to adequately respond to Harvard’s competitive edge and slight lead. 
Such a close race could almost have gone either way, but the Crimson finished the race with a one-second margin of victory, demonstrating a superior tenacity against its competition. 
Harvard’s second and third varsity eights also had extremely close, competitive races. The boats placed second in their respective races by a margin of less than two seconds. In contrast, the first novice eight had an outstanding performance, beating Navy’s opposing boat by 12 seconds. 
After this weekend’s performance, the Crimson can look forward to next weekend’s upcoming race against Princeton and Yale with confidence. Harvard is currently ranked second in the lightweight league while Princeton holds first, but among such strong crews, rankings are easily transcended. 
“It’s a good race for us to work off,” sophomore Andrew Trott said. “It also gave us a good example of what high pressure racing will be like for us.”
Harvard continues to easily produce win after win with every weekend, but keeps its ultimate goal in mind. 
“We don’t pay too much attention to rankings, but we know that Yale and Princeton are fast,” Overington said. “It’s great to win these dual races, but the really important races are the championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although conventional wisdom says that it is hard for freshmen to score, first-year attacker Jeff Cohen notched a career-high six goals at Harvard Stadium on Saturday to lift the No. 17 Harvard men’s lacrosse team over Holy Cross, 11-4. Mired in a three game losing streak with defeats to a trio of nationally ranked Ivy opponents, the Crimson (6-5, 1-3 Ivy) squared off against the Crusaders (3-11, 0-6 Patriot) in a non-league matchup. After a slow start, the Harvard attack struck early and often to stop its losing ways. “I thought the guys played hard,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “[We] didn’t always execute, play very smart or efficiently, but sometimes you have to be good enough just to work hard and grind it out.” The scoring began less than two minutes into the first period on Cohen’s first goal of the day. After gathering the ball behind the goal, the freshman circled the net, squared up in front of Holy Cross goaltender Jimmy Harrison, and slipped a shot past him down low. Harvard added two more goals in the first half, both from junior attacker Travis Burr. With 2:23 remaining in the opening period, Burr ran from behind the goal and finished top-shelf, and with 5:16 left in the second period, the junior received the ball on the left wing and fired a shot past Harrison. “Travis Burr has, through the last couple games, emerged as one of our leaders, especially on the offensive end, and it showed today,” Tillman said. The Crusaders’ only goal of the first half came as time was running out in the opening period. With fewer than 10 seconds remaining in the frame, Holy Cross fired a shot at Crimson goaltender Joe Pike. Pike blocked the attempt, but as the rebound rolled in front of the net, Crusaders attacker Chris Smirti raced in to scoop up the ball and converted on a diving shot with just 6.3 seconds left on the clock. At halftime, Harvard led 3-1, but held a substantial edge in shots, 19-8, groundballs, 14-6, and face-offs, 4-2. “We came out a little slow,” Cohen said. “We were a little lacking after the last three defeats that were pretty heartbreaking, but in the second half, we picked it up.”  “It’s not about talk right now, it’s about getting it done,” Tillman said he told his players at halftime. “It’s about somebody stepping up on each end of the field and being a better leader.” Cohen was one of the players that stepped up. Five minutes into the third period, junior defenseman Ben Smith scooped up a ground ball on the defensive end and raced downfield. He found Cohen on the left wing where the freshman fired a shot bottom shelf. A minute later, crisp passing led to Cohen gathering the ball on the right wing, where he converted on a shot to give the Crimson a 5-1 lead. Sloppy play led to three Harvard penalties that gave Holy Cross an opportunity to get back into the game. With a two man advantage midway through the third period, the Crusaders worked the ball around to Smirti who fired a shot past Pike. One minute later, another Crimson penalty gave Holy Cross a man-up opportunity and again, Smirti found the back of the net. Leading only 5-3, Harvard responded on the ensuing face-off. After gaining possession, captain midfielder Nick Smith raced up field, drove through the defense, and ripped a close range shot past Harrison. Smith’s score, his second of the season, ignited a 4-0 spurt that iced the game for the Crimson. In the fourth period, senior midfielder Nick Sapia tallied his first goal of the game, and Cohen notched number four and five for the game to complete the run. Cohen’s fifth goal, scored with 9:21 left in the contest, came after playing possum with the Crusader defense. Holding the ball behind the Holy Cross goal, Cohen waited until a defender would come out to challenge him. After a dozen seconds of inaction, a defender finally came, but Cohen simply ran past him and slipped a low shot into the net.    The Crusaders scored once in the final period, Smirti’s fourth of the game, before Harvard added two more. At 3:42, Cohen recorded his sixth goal of the game—for a team-leading 26th goal on the season, and one minute later, senior attacker Jeff Wannop scored his first and the team’s final goal of the game, for a final score of 11-4. Cohen’s six goals were the most in a game by a Crimson player since his older brother Greg Cohen ’07 scored six against Dartmouth in 2007.  “In the first half, we were shooting high, and [Harrison] was pretty tall and getting a lot of saves,” Cohen said. “At halftime, coach told us to shoot low, so we followed that. Of course, the shots were going in after that.” —Staff writer Timothy J. Walsh can be reached at twalsh@fas.harvard.edu.

Have you seen those dudes in Ratatat? They've got some nice hair. And by nice, we mean stringy and greasy. But it's understandable: they've got an alternative image to uphold, after all.
So it surprised us to know that they actually shower. According to reliable sources, a member of the duo was showering in the communal bathroom on the second floor of Weld after arriving on campus this afternoon. Members of the Harvard Concert Commission stood guard outside.
According to HCC director Julia C. Goldenheim, the Concert Commission provided showering spaces for some of Ratatat's crew. Mhmm Weld bathroom: that's some red carpet treatment. "Other people were in charge of this all day," Goldenheim said in an annoyed voice when asked to verify Ratatat's appearance in Weld. "There were different people in different places."
Well, the Concert Commission must not have done a good job cleaning up those boys because they looked pretty damn greasy up on stage later that night. Next to all that laser light and steam clouds, they nearly glistened.
More Yardfest coverage on the way.
