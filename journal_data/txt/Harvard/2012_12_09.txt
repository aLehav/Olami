After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going to miss Harvard athletics over J-term? Look no further—The Back Page has you covered. While most Harvard students will be headed home for the holidays, many Crimson athletes will be traveling the country. Read on to see when your favorite team will be coming to a town near you!
MEN’S BASKETBALL
The men’s basketball team will be cashing in its frequent flier miles as it flies cross country to California, where Amaker and Co. will be taking on Cal on Dec. 29 and St. Mary’s on New Year’s Eve. Up next on the team’s schedule will be a return home to take on Rice before the short drive up to Hanover to face Ivy foe Dartmouth. The Crimson will round out its J-term trip by going down south to Tennessee to play against Memphis on Jan. 19.
WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
 
The women will be joining their male counterparts in the Golden State, though they’ll be 500 miles away in the San Diego Surf ‘N Slam tournament before flying back to Cambridge to face UMass. The team will then travel to compete against Rhode Island before taking on Dartmouth, first on its home turf, then on the road.
MEN’S HOCKEY
 
The men’s hockey team will be looking at the bulk of its away games during J-term as it faces seven teams on unfriendly ice. After taking on Northeastern at home, the team will face Princeton for the first time all season before heading up to take on Quinnipiac. The men will then return to Boston to preview the Beanpot in its matchup against Boston University. Following suit of the basketball teams, the hockey team will then go to Hanover to face Dartmouth before going to New Haven to avenge its loss to Yale. The team will finish off its seven-game road trip in New York to try to even the series with Union.
WOMEN’S HOCKEY
Unlike the men’s team, the women’s squad will be playing the majority of its J-term games in the friendly atmosphere of Bright Hockey Center. After traveling to take on Union and Rensselaer, the women will return home to face a slew of familiar foes. First up are back-to-back games against Princeton and Quinnipiac, two teams that the Crimson has already defeated this season. After playing Connecticut on January 15, the women will take on Union and Rensselaer again, this time at home.
CREW
In a marked departure from the chilly waters of the Charles River, both crew teams will be heading south to the Sunshine State near the end of the break to get in some stroking before the spring season. Traveling to Sarasota, Fla. may not sound like training, but rest assured that these rowers will have their work cut out for them—in the words of one Liz O’Leary, there will be “miles and miles” rowed each day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s fencing team (5-0) cruised to a 26-1 win over Tufts (0-3) at the Malkin Athletic Center Friday evening. The Crimson’s foil and epee divisions posted perfect 9-0 bout records to wrap up team competition for the fall semester.
Harvard was dominant across the board against a Jumbos program that is now 0-for-20 against the Crimson all-time. In the foil division, co-captain Katherine Chou did not allow a single touch in her three bouts. Fellow co-captain and 2011 NCAA individual champion Alexandra Kiefer yielded only one.
In the epee division, freshman Nina van Loon built off her 14-1 performance at last weekend’s tournament in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with three more bout wins against the Jumbos. She, too, allowed just a single touch in her final two bouts.
“It’s hard to fence really clean with epee, but I think my last two bouts were how I wanted to fence—just really clean,” van Loon said.
The Crimson yielded its only bout in the sabre division.
Harvard has not defeated an opponent so soundly since a 27-0 shutout of North Carolina in December 2010. Following the meet, Crimson coach Peter Brand praised his team’s efforts but expressed disappointment in the Tufts fencing program, noting the absence of a Jumbos’ coach from the meet.
“Their coach doesn’t pay attention, doesn’t want to get into it,” Brand said. “It’s really discouraging.”
Last season, the Crimson defeated Tufts, 22-4. Harvard has outscored the Jumbos, 114-20, over their last five meetings and has not lost to the Jumbos since the two programs first met in 1981.
Friday night was Harvard’s last home meet of the season before the Crimson hosts the rest of the Ancient Eight in the Ivy League Championships, Feb. 9-10. As the semester comes to a close, Brand is looking ahead to the second half of the season as both his men’s and women’s programs hope to contend for titles.
“Our primary mission is to win the Ivy League Championship,” Brand said. “Both these teams have a chance at it this year. I think our men’s team is a little deeper…. But our women, if they fence the way they did today, are also going to be very competitive.”
The Harvard men’s fencing team is 4-1 on the season. The Crimson men’s and women’s only match losses of the season came against Penn State last weekend in Poughkeepsie.
Following final exams, the Harvard fencers will not catch much of a break. Most plan to train with their home club teams over the winter holiday, and the Crimson will return to Cambridge during J-term for team practices.
“You can’t take a break in the middle of the season,” Brand said. “They’re going to be working very hard.”
The Jan. 26 St. John’s Invitational in Queens, N.Y., looms large on the horizon for the Crimson. The invite will include defending NCAA women’s champion Ohio State and Ivy League rival Columbia. The Crimson will also face Notre Dame, Penn State and St. John’s—the three teams that placed just ahead of the No. 6 2011-12 Harvard women’s squad in the final national rankings last year.
“Going into January we have some really tough matches coming up, and that’s going to determine how we look this year,” Brand said.
Meanwhile, several Crimson fencers hope to improve their individual rankings in the coming weeks for national team berths. On Thursday, van Loon will take an international flight to Munich to compete at a World Cup tournament.
“It’s great for finals,” van Loon laughed. “You have to focus really hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4/5 Harvard women’s hockey team (9-1-1, 7-0-0 ECAC) went 1-0-1 this weekend to close out the first half of its season. Captain Jillian Dempsey scored the tying goal against the University of New Hampshire in a 2-2 draw on the road Saturday afternoon after exploding for four goals in an 8-1 home rout of Providence Friday evening.
HARVARD 2, UNH 2 (OT)
With less than three minutes left in the final frame of regulation, Dempsey let loose a quick wrist shot from the top of the right circle. UNH goaltender Jenn Gilligan could only watch as the puck clanged harmlessly off the left post.
Dempsey was just inches away from registering her sixth goal in less than 24 hours and completing a Harvard comeback. But the Crimson left Durham, N.H., with a 2-2 tie as the Wildcats (7-11-2, 4-4-1 Hockey East) weathered a forceful Harvard attack in the closing minutes.
“I think this game’s good for us,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “This is a good tie. For us to come back and scrap and claw back to 2-2, this makes me feel good, because our kids don’t quit. We had opportunities at the end of the game to win...and that’s all you can ask. Some days it’s not going to go click-click-click. It certainly didn’t today for us, but we found a way to get ourselves back even with them.”
The Crimson tied the game with nine minutes left in regulation as sophomore defender Sarah Edney telegraphed a slap shot from the point that bounced off Gilligan and onto the blade of a screening Dempsey. Dempsey pushed the puck past the goal line to extend her point streak to 25 games.
“I think that it was great that we were able to come back from behind,” Dempsey said, noting that Harvard had lost to Boston University in the last game that it had trailed an opponent. “There were a lot of positives, and we’re going to work on the negatives in this time off.”
The Crimson opened up the scoring in the second with a goal from freshman winger Miye D’Oench, who broke away from the UNH defense to beat Gilligan one-on-one in the crease. But the Wildcats responded with two goals from forwards Hannah Armstrong and Jessica Hitchcock less than 20 seconds apart before the second horn sounded.
Harvard outshot its opponents 9-3 in the third as Dempsey produced the equalizer and nearly pulled the Crimson ahead. In overtime, Harvard registered another three shots on goal but failed to put the game-winner between the pipes.
Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer recorded 16 saves for the Crimson. Dempsey now leads all NCAA Division I scorers with 1.27 goals per game and has tallied at least one point in 25 straight games.
HARVARD 8, PROVIDENCE 1
Dempsey scored four goals in a commanding Harvard win over Providence (8-8-4, 5-4-2 Hockey East) at the Bright Hockey Center Friday night, 8-1.
Junior Gina McDonald tipped a rebound to a wide-open Dempsey, who buried the puck with an easy chip shot for the Crimson’s final goal of the game. It was a fitting bookend for a Harvard scoring drive that appeared almost effortless at times.
“I was set up really nicely—some beautiful passes,” Dempsey said of her goals. “It all started in the D-zone with the D making great plays and then moving it up…. It’s meshing well.”
After 19 minutes of missed offensive opportunities, the Crimson broke through in the final minute of the first period with a goal from senior defender Kelsey Romatoski, who lined up a powerful wrist shot from the top of the circle that fluttered past the left glove of Friar goaltender Nina Riley. The Crimson rode the momentum into the locker room.
“That goal at the end of that first period...was huge for us,” Stone said. “Then we just came out like gangbusters in the second period.”
Harvard caught fire in the second with three goals in less than three minutes, two of which were spaced less than 19 seconds apart.
Before the PA announcer had time to read senior Kaitlin Spurling’s goal assisted by freshman Mary Parker, Dempsey tore across the blueline and launched a shot from the top of the circle that found the net for her first goal of the game and the Crimson’s third.
Dempsey added her second goal of the game two minutes and 21 seconds later. D’Oench rounded out the second period scoring for the Crimson with a coast-to-coast strike.
In the third, Romatoski and Dempsey added to their tallies, scoring their second and third goals of the game, respectively, 22 seconds apart. Dempsey added her fourth with less than four minutes left in the final frame.
The Harvard scoring machine systematically limited Providence’s opportunities as the Crimson outshot the Friars, 44 to 17, and logged only one minor penalty to Providence’s four. Junior goaltender Laura Bellamy appeared on her way to her fifth shutout in six games before Friar forward Jessica Vella scored Providence’s only goal with 10 seconds left in the game.
“[Bellamy] played well; she made the saves she needed to make,” Stone said. “It was kind of a bummer for her at the end, but, hey, it doesn’t matter. A win’s a win; that’s what we’re looking for.”
