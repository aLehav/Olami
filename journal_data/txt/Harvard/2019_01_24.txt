After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ariana Grande’s latest release, a trap-inflected interpolation of "My Favorite Things," is not entirely charmless, but following her superior 2018 releases "Sweetener" (the best album of the year by our estimation) and "thank u, next,” it is a disappointment.
"7 rings," like the singles Grande released before it, tells a personal story: The title of the track was inspired by Grande's purchase of Tiffany & Co. engagement rings as gifts for six female friends after she and SNL comedian Pete Davidson famously got engaged and shortly broke off their engagement this past year. The aspiring breakup anthem, a putative paean to the restorative pleasures of friendship and "retail therapy," is tonally off. While singing about her success isn't new for Grande, this track runs decidedly frosty, where her previous work on this subject is warmly ebullient. While one could imagine a version of this song with its cheeky, braggadocious lyrics — "Whoever said money can't solve your problems / Must not have had enough money to solve them" — that is both funny and fun to listen to, Grande's detached and half-rapped boasting about her love of "ATM machines" and "big deposits," is transactional, repetitive, and frankly alienating. The chorus, in which she flatly chants, "I want it, I got it," again and again does nothing to remedy this problem.
The chorus in particular is a bad look for Grande as it sounds suspiciously similar to the chorus from rapper Princess Nokia's "Mine” from her mixtape "1992.” As reported in Pitchfork, Princess Nokia posted a video of herself on Twitter listening to part of the Grande track and commented, “Ain’t that the lil song I made about brown women and their hair? Hmmm... Sounds about white.” In the chorus of “Mine” Princess Nokia repeats “It's mine, I bought it,” referring to her hair. Ariana’s chorus is rhythmically and sonically like Princess Nokia’s and also features a similar reference to hair: "You like my hair? / Gee thanks, just bought it.” Where Princess Nokia’s verse is a moving claim of ownership over her hair and a challenge to both invasive questioning from white people and eurocentric beauty standards, Ariana’s verse sounds appropriative.
Grande’s best recent works, hit singles like “no tears left to cry” and “thank u, next,” are moving expressions of hard-earned joy after painful personal experiences, from the bombing at her concert in Manchester to the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller. These tracks play to her musical strengths, making full use of her expansive vocal range over sparkling pop backings, while “7 rings,” illogically banks on Grande’s rapping abilities — there’s a reason she usually collaborates with actual rappers — and objectionably features verses that are appropriative in all senses of the word.
This awkward and contrived single is a notable misstep from a talented and ordinarily savvy musician.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions continued to spar over whether the College’s admissions process discriminates against Asian-American applicants in clashing court filings submitted Wednesday.
In the documents — rebuttals to the “proposed findings of fact” and “proposed conclusions of the law” that each side submitted in December — Harvard and SFFA object to each other’s interpretations of the most relevant evidence and testimony from a three-week trial that began in mid-October.
The filings are the latest development in a five-year lawsuit that could determine the fate of affirmative action at private colleges and universities nationwide. SFFA originally sued Harvard in 2014, arguing the College’s admissions protocols discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
SFFA’s brief alleges that Harvard engages in racial balancing in the College’s admissions process. Lawyers for the organization scrutinized the 259 claims that lawyers for Harvard made in their December filing, concluding that just 10 are “accurate,” while the other 249 were “inaccurate,” “incomplete,” or “misleading,” according to the SFFA document.
Lawyers for SFFA argue in their brief that Harvard’s admissions process discriminates against some College hopefuls because being Asian American has a “negative effect” on an applicant’s personal rating — a numerical rating assigned to applicants that scores them on qualities including humor and grit. They allege the University has not seriously explored race-neutral admissions policies.
Harvard’s lawyers defended the College’s admissions protocols, arguing the “Court should enter judgment in Harvard’s favor” on all issues Burroughs is currently considering.
The University’s attorneys argued a race-conscious admissions process is the only way to secure diversity on campus, and they attributed the lower personal ratings that some Asian-American applicants received to high school recommenders and alumni interviewers, rather than admissions officers. They also contended the school had explored non-race-conscious admissions options and found they would not result in a diverse enough student body.
The two sides also sparred over who should shoulder the burden of proof in the case. SFFA claimed the University has a burden of proof to show that it does not discriminate, while lawyers for Harvard argued the plaintiff needs to prove conscious “racial animus” toward Asian-American applicants in order to show discrimination.
Legal standards of proof were not the only topic of contention in Wednesday’s filings; the two sides also continued their long-standing argument over admissions data that formed a key part of the evidence presented at trial.
Harvard’s brief reiterated the University’s objections to analysis performed by Duke economist Peter Arcidiacono, hired by SFFA as an expert witness, that concluded the data showed recurring discrimination against Asian-American Harvard hopefuls. Echoing an argument they had made in multiple previous filings, lawyers for the University wrote that Arcidiacono’s decision to exclude personality ratings, athletes, and legacy students from his statistical model marked a “failure to model how the admissions process actually works.”
SFFA called Harvard’s objections to Arcidiacono’s analysis “disappointing,” and argued he designed his model to compare “apples-to-apples” and eliminate all metrics in the admissions process that race influences, including personality ratings.
SFFA also attacked the analysis conducted by David E. Card, a University of California, Berkeley professor and Harvard’s hired expert, whose statistical model found that Asian-Americans are not the target of discrimination. Lawyers for the group argued Card did not adequately investigate whether an applicant's race influences his or her personal scores. Harvard’s attorneys defended Card’s analysis in their filing.
On Feb. 13, lawyers representing Harvard and SFFA will have another opportunity to make post-trial closing arguments in front of Burroughs, who is expected to issue her decision in the months following the hearing. Legal experts have said they expect that whichever side loses will appeal, and the case could end up in front of the United States Supreme Court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Madeline Raster knew her three was going to come up short. So she raced to the hoop, grabbed her own rebound, and laid the ball in to put Harvard up 12-0.
The co-captain’s layup was one of many pure effort plays early on for the Crimson, who made a statement to open Ivy League play. Harvard (8-6, 1-0 Ivy) shut out Dartmouth 14-0 in the first quarter en route to a comfortable 56-46 win at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday.
It was clear throughout the game that the home side came ready to play. The Crimson blitzed Dartmouth from the start and finished the first half up 27-7. Junior Mackenzie Barta hit a catch-and-shoot three from the top of the key with time expiring, a big shot that served as a fitting coda to Harvard’s dominant half. The Big Green (7-7, 0-1) looked unable to keep up early on, though they looked much better after halftime, winning the third quarter 27-12 and cutting the Crimson’s lead to five points before Harvard regained control of the game in the fourth quarter and secured its fourth consecutive win.
“I just think the pieces are falling into the right places and at the right time,” said junior point guard Katie Benzan.
Junior Jeannie Boehm set the tone on both ends of the court, leading the Crimson with 12 points and 13 rebounds and adding two steals and two blocks. She was an integral part of Harvard’s domination both defensively and on the glass. The Crimson out-rebounded the Big Green 50-34, with 18 of those rebounds coming on the offensive end. Harvard gobbled up more than half of its own missed shots, more evidence that the team played with a lot of effort on Saturday.
The Crimson held Dartmouth to just 29% shooting from the field and an abysmal 19% from beyond the arc. Senior forward Isalys Quinones, the Big Green’s leading scorer, was held to just three points and three rebounds — largely thanks to a tremendous defensive effort by Harvard forwards Boehm and sophomore Jadyn Bush.
While the Crimson was dominant defensively, it did not look like the team that scored 80 and 85 points at Rhode Island and California respectively on the offensive end. Harvard shot a combined 50% from the floor and 44% from three and turned the ball over just 19 total times in the two impressive road wins that ended an up-and-down non-conference performance.
That offensive efficiency was nowhere to be found against Dartmouth’s tough defense, which allows just a shade over 58 points per game, making it the stingiest defense in the Ivy League. The Crimson shot just 37% from the floor Saturday and turned the ball over 23 times, their most since a double-overtime thriller against Quinnipiac at the end of November.
Given those team-wide offensive struggles, it is no surprise that Harvard’s offensive engine, Benzan, had a subpar offensive game Saturday, shooting just 1-of-8 from the field and 1-of-6 from three point range. The Crimson’s point guard and leading scorer was held way below her season averages, finishing with a meager five points and two assists.
Harvard was resilient enough to win despite its star’s down offensive game. Benzan was thrilled to leave the game with a comfortable double-digit victory.
“It always feels good to start off [league play] with a win,” Benzan said. “It gives us a confidence boost into this coming weekend.”
The Crimson will hope to build on its defensive success and improve its offense next Saturday in a rematch with Dartmouth. Harvard will look to start off 2-0 in the league and to complete a season sweep of the Big Green. The Crimson will be seeking to avenge last season’s seven point loss at Dartmouth, its first loss in Hanover since 2013. If Harvard can combine its efficient performances at Rhode Island and California with its stellar defense and rebounding in this game, it will be a real threat to win its first Ivy League title since it shared the honors with the Big Green in 2008.
