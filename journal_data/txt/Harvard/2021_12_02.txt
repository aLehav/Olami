After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The email landed in my inbox at 11:36 p.m. A first-year Master in Public Policy student who is deaf wrote that the economics pre-class video didn’t have any captions that could be toggled on. Without captions, she couldn’t understand the key concept in the video, and she needed to know the concept prior to tomorrow’s class. I forwarded her email to the class’s faculty assistant to request that captions be added to this video and all future videos be captioned before they are published. But how did this happen?
I’m a course assistant for the required microeconomics class for first-year MPP students at Harvard Kennedy School. Instead of teaching about budget sets, elasticity, and indifference curves, I, alongside the teaching team, found myself pleading with the disability accommodations coordinator at HKS for an additional tutor to support students with disabilities.
This fall, I discovered that students with disabilities do not merely experience one-off inconveniences. They are being systematically underserved by HKS’s bureaucracy.
Inadequate accommodations for students with disabilities began immediately in our course. On day one, a student informed me that she requested the lecture slides be emailed to her in advance due to a vision disability that necessitated that she view the slides on her laptop. She had circulated her accessibility requests, which included slides to be emailed to her in advance, to faculty heads. However, none of her accessibility needs were met. I ripped a piece of paper from my notebook, handed it to her, and said: “Please write down your email address. I’ll make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
Many able-bodied students are accustomed to frustrating experiences when navigating the HKS bureaucracy on issues ranging from financial aid to course registration. For students with disabilities, however, these inconveniences evolve into recurring headaches that impair their ability to thrive academically and socially.
HKS has a legal obligation to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the ADA, accommodations should be customized to meet the individual needs of the student with a disability. It’s understandable why HKS takes a bureaucratic and reactive approach to providing accommodations. Evaluating each disability and providing the proper support requires time and resources. Better to get the job done right albeit slowly, the thinking goes, than fast and wrong.
HKS could implement two ideas now, however, that would satisfy the ADA and improve the learning experience for students with disabilities: conduct a disability audit and adopt a proactive mindset.
A disability audit sets the foundation to comprehensively provide for students with disabilities. An MPP student who is low vision recommended a disability audit as a necessary first step in the process. She thought the buildings, the curriculum, and the extracurricular activities should all be included in a disability audit run by HKS in collaboration with disability experts, and that it should happen with great urgency. This student knew of vision-impaired students who had tripped going down the stairs between Wexner Hall and the Café. If disability experts helped to conduct an audit, she told me, they would have pointed out that those stairs needed to be outlined with tape. Once a disability audit is completed, the HKS administration also needs to publicly commit to implementing the recommendations.
Next, HKS must shift its administrative culture from being reactive to being proactive. One potential way to do this is by instilling a customer-service mindset among faculty and staff. Under a customer-service mindset, staff are not waiting for problems to arise before acting. Instead, they look at historical data and trends to anticipate the needs of the client and recommend services to the client at the outset. The service offerings would be modified and iterated based on periodic feedback from the client, and successful solutions would be scaled up and adopted.
To demonstrate what a customer-service mindset might look like in practice, the student who is deaf pointed out that once HKS is made aware that a deaf student will enroll for the upcoming academic year, they should start to prepare the necessary accommodations. They could use the accommodations that they set with her as a model, and then tailor them based on an individual deaf student’s need. That way, HKS can cover all the possible accommodation needs, and reduce the ones that are not needed — rather than doing it the opposite way. Take off what you don’t need and keep what you do, she told me.
The adoption of a hybrid-learning model this academic year in response to Covid-19 demonstrates that the HKS administration is more than capable of implementing technically complex solutions to address student accommodation needs. A school with a proactive culture and customer service mindset does not solely benefit students with disabilities. It benefits everyone. That, in itself, is a goal worth pursuing and dedicating resources to make a reality.
HKS can often appear to be a bureaucratic institution with legacy departments that were designed in a bygone era to comply with legal mandates. However, interested students can accelerate change by joining the HKS Disability Justice Caucus and connecting with like-minded students who can help make HKS a better place for students with disabilities. HKS can be an accommodating and inclusive environment for everyone. Let’s make it happen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What some Harvard students might not know are the fears other students may have around developing substance dependency issues.
College, for many, is our first time away from the pressures of home. As a result, students often experiment with substances. In a survey of 400 people, 82 percent stated that it is even normal to experiment with alcohol or drugs in college. Few would argue against social drinking. However, this leaves students like me who have had negative lived experiences with drugs and alcohol in an awkward position.
Substance dependency and addiction problems are omnipresent. From the extremes of heroin and opioids to milder alcohol and weed, the United States is no stranger to substance abuse. With 65 percent of our prison population having an active substance use issue and an additional 20 percent under the influence while committing their crime, it is also easy to see the pipeline between addiction and quality of life. Spending time in prison or falling prey to addiction can make it more difficult to lead a fulfilling life. It has the capability to ruin lives, relationships, and ambitions. There is a crisis in the United States. But is there a crisis at Harvard?
More than most places, college campuses typically teem with alcohol and other illicit substances. And Ivy Leagues like Harvard are not the exception. Clandestine behavior nestles its way into our dorms and campuses. Students looking for a social lubricant over the weekend or a mental intoxicant after a day’s stress can find it at Harvard. But, this does not change the fact that even under the influence of simpler substances, students with histories of family dependency or addiction must rationalize their reluctance towards substance use, especially in social settings.
My father was incarcerated eight different times for substance-related issues. His addictions, while not necessarily ever-present, were still subtly perceptible: present in the way he would choose to drive while intoxicated, or in how he became a gaunt figure towards the end of his life. There are always signs, despite how hard an individual tries to mask them.
So, naturally, there is a great deal of anxiety surrounding dependency fears, even at a supposed haven like Harvard. Even if addiction arises, Harvard students’ hush-hush, sensationalized, and naive approach to drugs and alcohol results in student fear to seek help and relative misuse of substances. The haven at Harvard is flawed.
Moreover, those with family addiction problems or past histories feel guilt. Harvard offers a bubble. Despite many Harvard students’ personal awareness of the illicit substances that surround them, a disproportionately low number of drug and alcohol offenses are reported by the Harvard University Police Department. In part, this is commendable. It means that the University does not take a punitive approach to drug and alcohol abuse compared to the rest of the United States. Nevertheless, students with histories tinged by drug abuse are left with moral dilemmas.
I once watched my father die from drug use. I now am in an environment where “gateway drugs” are widespread and uncritically consumed. I can read about my father’s misconduct with alcohol on the Indiana Offender Database. I now regularly see students incapacitated by alcohol on weekends. I am left ambivalent.
I do not have an answer for how to tackle drug and substance abuse for students with experiences like mine nor for students who may be currently fighting addiction themselves. It is not an easy issue to face, and the inner conflict that arises for such students in situations with alcohol or drugs is difficult to grapple with. Navigating addiction is not a normal part of the college experience. The choices these students make in such situations are diverse, unique, and contingent on past experience and current pressures.
While I am ambivalent, another person with tough memories tied to drug use might not be. Perhaps the best answer right now is to be constantly aware of who you are, your surroundings, and to recognize the strength of your limitations. And hopefully, as “what some Harvard students might not know” turns into “what some Harvard students are finally aware of,” the load will be easier to carry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has successfully formed a government in Bulgaria. Err, let’s try again: “The Harvards” — two Harvard graduates from Bulgaria, Kiril Petkov and Assen Vassilev ’00, nicknamed after their alma mater — are poised to lead the country after the political party they founded emerged victorious in the Balkan nation’s third parliamentary election of 2021.
After former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov — Bulgaria’s former prime minister, in power for over a decade — sank under corruption allegations and months of anti-government protests, Petkov and Vassilev’s anti-corruption party, We Continue the Change, is slated to assume control. The new party comes at a critical point in Bulgaria’s history, recently faced with a rule-of-law crisis, mass distrust in government, and, with the lowest vaccine uptake among the European Union, a broiling Covid-19 pandemic.
We are happy to see that the protests in Bulgaria have led to the rise of political leaders who promise change, honesty, and stability for the Bulgarian people. Though their actions in the coming months — if they manage to form a coalition — will speak louder than the words it took to get them here, the party’s victory seems to be democracy’s response to Bulgarian’s activism.
It seems as though Kiril Petkov — a graduate of the Harvard Business School — and Assen Vassilev — a graduate of Harvard College (Economics in Currier House!), HBS, and Harvard Law School — are well on their way to becoming the “citizen-leaders” our university hopes to educate within its gates. It is encouraging to see these trailblazers apply skills they gathered at Harvard, which may have been difficult to attain elsewhere, to their home communities – wherever they may be. Perhaps even more encouraging is that many young Bulgarian expats have followed Petkov and Vassilev’s lead and returned to the country to get to work reforming their home.
Yet one aspect of the election that has troubled us a bit, despite our jokes, is the outsized emphasis on these two men’s Harvard educations. After all, Petkov and Vassilev were chosen by Bulgarian President Rumen Radev as ministers in the country’s interim government – from which they launched their campaign – in large part due to the Harvard name alone. Treating a university brand as qualifying in and of itself is peculiar and potentially detrimental along two axes: Firstly, it perpetuates the falsehood that a degree from Harvard instantly renders an individual more adept at handling anything than anyone else, an idea as present in the U.S. as it may be in Bulgaria. Secondly, it erases the likely far more important achievements of its subjects beyond the favorable ruling they, often in youth, are handed by the admissions office.
To that end, we hope to see a future in which we step away from name-dropping – both domestically and as far away as Bulgaria – and instead focus on what our citizen-leaders, including Petkov and Vassilev, have done with their credentials to earn our respect.
In the meantime, we wish these two men all the best — especially as they continue the difficult and crucial work of forming a coalition government from quarreling opposition parties and, potentially, the very establishment party these groups oppose. Perhaps, in the process, they’ll find their Harvard education useful.

Harvard’s Culture Lab Innovation Fund awarded grants to 14 teams working on projects to further diversity and inclusion on Harvard’s campus, the University announced last month.
Started in 2019 as a joint initiative between the Office of the President and the University’s Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, the Innovation Fund awards grants of up to $15,000 for initiatives that “advance a culture of belonging” on campus, per OEDIB’s website.
This year’s grant cycle offered application tracks on racial justice, mental health, and rebuilding community, though applicants could also choose a topic of their choice.
The 14 chosen initiatives, which Harvard publicly announced on Nov. 16, include standardizing pronoun data for Harvard affiliates, relieving stress experienced by Black students and staff through music, and implementing race-conscious curricula at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
In an emailed statement, Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston said the Culture Lab — which received nearly 100 applications this year — looks forward to supporting the projects.
“The 14 project teams that received funding to pilot their ideas represent a shared commitment from University leadership and community members across Harvard to advance a culture of equity, inclusion, and belonging,” Charleston wrote.
The grant recipients, who learned of their selection this past summer, have been able to use the Harvard funding to begin implemention of their projects.
One of the chosen proposals, called the Peer Coaching Initiative, aims to equip students with tools to effectively support and listen to one another.
Marc O. Roudebush, a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education who is leading the project, said the initiative can help address mental health challenges for the student population.
“What the peer coaching does, that I thought could be helpful in that context, is it gives people an experience of being very open and honest and safe in talking to a peer about their aspirations and their struggles,” Roudebush said.
Roudebush said he and his team had a “great” experience applying for the grant, and that writing their application helped them further develop their idea, which was piloted at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
“It forced us to really think through, ‘How is this relevant to inclusion, equity and belonging? How is this relevant to mental health?’” Roudebush said.
Another project recipient, Pronoun Data, is working to centralize Harvard affiliate pronoun data to help affiliates respectfully address one another.
“People have been asking for it as a show of Harvard’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging,” said project leader Carolyn M. Emberley, who serves as associate director of Harvard’s Identity and Access Management Services. “So where we see it going is being able to serve the data out to a bunch of different places.”
The project Harm to Harmony, which also received a grant this year, seeks to promote the philosophy of restorative justice — which promotes reconciliation and rehabilitation — to address instances of harm on campus.
Harm to Harmony project co-lead Bonnie M. Talbert, a lecturer in Social Studies, wrote in an email that she enjoyed collaborating with her colleagues on the grant proposal during the pandemic.
“Even though there was a lot of uncertainty while planning a project during a pandemic, it felt really good to be able to keep going through the inevitable setbacks and logistical hurdles that we faced,” Talbert wrote.

Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health announced a new academic and research collaboration with Tsinghua University’s Vanke School of Public Health in Beijing in a press release on Wednesday.
Through the partnership, the institutions intend to develop a joint course, identify joint research opportunities, and create a visiting scholars program to enable researchers from Vanke SPH to spend time at Harvard.
The collaboration was announced at an event Wednesday hosted by the Asia Society Hong Kong Center featuring University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams, Vanke SPH Dean Margaret Chan, and Tsinghua University Provost Yang Bin.
In response to the pandemic, Williams and Chan have also jointly founded a Global Coalition of Deans of Schools of Public Health, per the press release. The Coalition will work to promote international collaborations in global health research and education among universities, industry, and governments.
Williams emphasized the importance of such global partnerships in endeavors to combat major health crises.
“We have seen more clearly than ever over this past year that threats ranging from microscopic pathogens all the way up to planet-wide shifts in climate can leap borders and threaten the health of billions,” she said in the press release. “Only by working together can we develop—and then enact—a global health security agenda that predicts, prepares for, and responds to these threats.”
Recently, HSPH has strengthened and expanded its numerous international partnerships to address a slew of global health issues.
In November, HSPH launched a bilateral exchange program with Zhejiang University School of Medicine in Eastern China that seeks to train Chinese doctors in clinical research, particularly clinical epidemiology.
The Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership — a collaborative research and training initiative that is Africa’s largest HIV/AIDS lab — was the first to sequence the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, dubbed Omicron.
In her prepared remarks for the event, a copy of which were provided to The Crimson in advance by HSPH, Williams stressed the significance of the present moment.
“Now is the time to show the world that meaningful collaboration can lead to genuine solutions,” she said. “Now is the time to build a multilateral coalition committed to tackling the biggest challenges in public health.”
In his prepared remarks, also provided to The Crimson prior to the event by HSPH, Garber said that “this initiative arrives at just the right moment.”
“In the face of these historically high stakes, academic scientists have an obligation to join with partners in the public and private sectors — and with other research institutions worldwide — to bring forward new solutions,” he added. “We need to think creatively and collaboratively, for the sake of our planet and the health of the people on it.”

Harvard chief financial officer Thomas J. Hollister said the University’s finances are “moving in the right direction” in a Wednesday interview, though he cautioned that officials remain alert in the ever-changing landscape of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Thanks to the stewardship of everyone across the campus, we emerged from the pandemic in a pretty good financial condition, which we’re very fortunate to be in,” Hollister said. “Consequently, Harvard is moving forward in a lot of ways.”
Though some spikes in Covid-19 cases have shifted the University’s protocols, the situation has stabilized in comparison to the beginning months of the pandemic, Hollister said.
“The financial ramifications of those ups and downs — unless we have to go completely remote or we can’t get into the labs, or the economy really starts to shake — compared to a year, year and a half ago, things are more stable,” Hollister said. “I think that’s true across the country, I think it’s true on campuses — that we’re all kind of living with this [pandemic].”
To prepare affiliates for an in-person semester, the University spent $83 million in Covid-19 testing and contact tracing, personal protective equipment, and equipment to reconfigure laboratories and classrooms for safe, in-person learning, according to an annual financial report released in October.
Now, Hollister said, Harvard is better equipped to handle pandemic-related costs because much of the virus prevention framework is already in place.
“I would say that the testing and tracing will be more, but a lot of the [costs associated with] one-time setup, get organized, try to figure out how to run the campus will be less,” Hollister said.
Despite the added costs accrued from pandemic-related expenses and losses, the University still ended the last fiscal year with a $283 million surplus in its operating budget.
Bolstered by strong financial markets, the endowment skyrocketed to a historic value of $53.2 billion based on the latest returns reported in October.
While financial experts pointed out that Harvard’s endowment underperformed compared to its peer institutions despite its record returns, Hollister praised Harvard Management Company CEO Narv N.P. Narvekar’s leadership and his performance over the past four years.
“I think the management team — Narv Narvekar and his colleagues — are doing an excellent job,” Hollister said. “Over the last four years of Narv’s leadership, the average return has been 14.8 percent, which is really excellent, and the comparative returns in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 exceeded many of our peers.”
“In fact, Narv says it in his letter, if he had the same asset allocations as our peers, we would have been much higher on our returns. But everything is moving in the right direction,” he added.
With returns surpassing 30 percent, Hollister said he expects the University’s operating budget to receive a bump in funding from the endowment’s payout.
According to the annual financial report, the University received an increase in current-use gifts — donations without specific spending restrictions — last year, which allowed for more funds to be directed to health and safety provisions and financial aid. Hollister said he hopes the University continues to receive these unrestricted donations.
“I don’t have a crystal ball on the economy or the stock market, which make a big difference to alums and graduates in their capacity or willingness to make donations,” Hollister said. “We’re very cautious in estimating what may happen, and we hope to be surprised on the upside.”
Hollister added that the University is also focused on reinvigorating the undergraduate house renewal project, which was delayed due to a citywide construction moratorium mandate at the onset of the pandemic.
Resuming construction has not been easy, however, given pandemic-related disruptions to supply chains, according to Hollister.
“Sometimes getting key raw materials or even getting people to work on the jobs has been more of a challenge, but we’re steady-as-she-goes,” Hollister said. “Adams House has been done in different phases, and those phases are very active right now, and we expect them to continue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators at the Dean of Students Office discussed plans to reopen House grilles and host Junior Parents Weekend in the spring semester in an interview last month.
House grilles — student-run eateries that offer late-night snacks — closed due to Covid-19 protocols in March 2020 and have not reopened. This fall, House grilles’ management began the process of reopening.
“A lot of the House grilles are planning to open in the spring,” Assistant Dean of Student Engagement Kate T. Colleran said. “They are completing the certification training, and they are setting up the appropriate visits with the inspections and making sure all the equipment is ready to go.”
Alysha L. Johnson Williams ’14, a tutor in Quincy House, said she has been leading the efforts to help reopen the Quincy House grille. Johnson managed the grille as an undergraduate at the College.
“We were hoping to be open this semester,” Johnson said. “The biggest challenge was just kind of the loss in institutional memory.”
“The way we’ve always run is the former grille managers train up the next year’s grille managers. They’re the experts, if you will,” Johnson added. “Given that we were a year-and-a-half without the grille, managers graduate — just trying to build up that institutional memory again has been a big challenge.”
The grille’s managers also had to obtain certifications and licenses, which Johnson explained required “a lot of meetings.”
“Grilles, as you might know, have to go through different licensing with not only Harvard but the City of Cambridge, and so we do function like a real restaurant,” Johnson said.
Quincy’s student grille managers had to be licensed and trained in different areas, such as allergen awareness, milk service, and choking safety.
“We’ve been working to get [the Cambridge] certifications and inspections scheduled and passed along with the Harvard side,” Johnson said.
Johnson said she is looking forward to the grille getting up and running in the spring.
“Oh God, I miss mozzarella sticks,” Johnson said. “I actually think the Quincy Grille is such a big community-builder in the House. So I’m really excited for the students to be able to have that sense of community back.”
The DSO administrators also said in the interview that they are planning Junior Family Weekend, which typically takes place in February.
Colleran said Junior Family Weekend would look “very similar to First-Year Family Weekend,” which took place this October.
“What looks a little different for Junior Family Weekend is that the Houses are involved,” Colleran said. “We do try to get the families into the Houses to see where their students are living.”
In previous years, House faculty deans have welcomed families with indoor receptions, Colleran noted.
“We’ll have to figure that out, just because we did a good balance during First-Year Family Weekend of not having so many people, so many outside guests in our buildings,” Colleran said. “That’s going to have to be something we’re thoughtful about with Junior Family Weekend.”
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said the DSO would rely on Harvard’s Covid-19 guidelines to ensure spring semester programming remains safe for all involved.
“We defer to the University’s Covid-19 protocols,” O’Dair said. “We’ll just await that guidance.”

Harvard Medical School executive assistant Sarah E. Hillman took a picture of her desk on March 13, 2020 — the last day she was on campus before transitioning to remote work throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
She remembers sending it to a friend, texting, “I hope I see this again. Bye for now.”
The next time Hillman returned to work in the office was 18 months later, on Sept. 10 of this year.
To this day, not every Harvard employee has returned to working on campus.
At the Graduate School of Education’s Center for Educational Policy Research, project coordinator Juda Smack has not been back to work in the office since March 2020. Instead, he is working remotely from Harlem, N.Y. Smack wrote in an email that he believes his team will likely not return to campus until next year.
Harvard’s more than 5,000 unionized clerical and technical workers have faced different transitions back to working on campus. Juggling health guidelines as well as employees’ needs and preferences, many departments switched — temporarily or permanently — to hybrid arrangements. Within teams, employees often have their own flexible work schedules.
A Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers survey conducted last summer found that 93 percent of the 2,873 respondents said they wanted to build remote work into their schedules in the short-term; 92 percent said they wanted to incorporate remote work into their long-term schedules.
HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash said she believes the pandemic has made people more open-minded about what work should look like.
“It does seem that Covid has created a cultural shift at many departments at Harvard,” she said. “Managers, HR departments have shifted their mindsets of this so they’re more open to different, creative ways of looking at schedules.”
From March to June 2020, Harvard librarian Michael B. Mellor worked from his dining table. Gradually he returned to working in person, eventually returning full time on Aug. 2 of this year.
Mellor’s colleagues had different timelines for returning to in-person work. Some returned full-time in June 2020, while others came back more than a year later.
“Even in our small library group, there has been a wide range of experiences,” he wrote in an email.
In March, Harvard set Aug. 2 as its target date for faculty, researchers, and staff to begin to return to campus.
More than a month after that August target, library conservationist Katherine Westermann Gray returned to in-person work full time. The time away from the bench fixing pages and book covers had created backlog and unexpected difficulties, she said.
“My muscles for that work have atrophied, and so I’m actually finding that I’m a bit sore trying to do that work again,” she said.
While some employees have returned to campus full time, others have continued to split their schedules between home and the office.
Leslie MacPherson, departmental administrator for the Office of Ministry Studies at Harvard Divinity School, returned to campus on Aug. 2 of this year on a hybrid schedule, usually with two days in the office and three days at home per week.
She said the Divinity School helped her create an ideal workflow — the flexibility her current schedule affords her feels like “an amazing moment of balance,” she said.
MacPherson also said spending time back on campus has enabled her to reconnect with students.
“I’m very much an extrovert, so to me, one of the great joys of my job is my coworkers, seeing the students, seeing other faculty,” she said.
Some departments had to delay bringing staff back to campus. Jason D. Gerdom, a senior technical support analyst at the Business School, wrote in an email it took longer than he anticipated for his department to get the office back up and running.
“It’s easy to say ‘return to campus,’ but the work that goes into making that happen is remarkable,” he wrote.
Scheduling when people come in, Gerdom said in an interview, has been a logistical hurdle. He also noted supply shortages have made it difficult to set up the office in an efficient and Covid-safe manner.
Even before the onset of the pandemic, HUCTW’s contract included flexible work options, and union organizers were already trained to help employees negotiate non-traditional schedules. This past August, Harvard announced it would pay state income taxes for employees working remotely in seven additional states on the East Coast.
Building those non-traditional schedules is often a dialogue between employees and managers, and some conversations are smoother than others, according to Barbash.
“We do have a lot of folks who are trying to move to hybrid schedules and for some that’s going really smoothly,” she said. “That’s been great to see. Then for others they’re having some difficulty, either with their department or their supervisor or someone above their supervisor or with HR, in some cases.”
Monica Lesar, an alumni reunion manager at the Business School, said she is grateful for the union’s engagement with members over the pandemic.
“I am so appreciative of all the work the union’s done over the last year to support its members,” she said.
Ahmed Ahmed, an accounting assistant at Harvard University Information Technology, said that though he had his doubts about remote work, he quickly saw the benefits: less commute time and more time with his son.
“I was very skeptical [about] remote work before Covid, but I became a believer and a convert and advocate for working from home, because the work gets done,” he said.
Remote work may have increased productivity — according to the HUCTW survey, 75 percent of respondents said they were more productive working from home.
For Gerdom, at the Business School, the transition to remote work at the start of the pandemic transformed his department’s workflow. When Harvard emptied its campus, Gerdom recalls the department started using a workflow it had previously used for inclement weather days, which was not sustainable.
In July 2020, Gerdom said he and a group of his colleagues approached management with a new workflow model. They suggested dividing all work into two categories: unanticipated tasks that required immediate attention and planned projects. To promote consistency, technicians only worked within one mode.
Management, Gerdom said, was “incredibly receptive” and they began piloting the program in September 2020, refining it over several months. The new workflow proved effective and even boosted morale and customer satisfaction, according to Gerdom.
“Now we’re positioned where we can come back — people can physically be on campus — but we can maintain the workstreams,” Gerdom said in August. “It gives us a lot of flexibility to still be able to work the way we are.”
Some employees have found they prefer working remotely permanently. Kelsey Palmer, a study operations manager at the Medical School, has been working remotely since the start of the pandemic. She said she currently enjoys living on Cape Cod and does not plan to come back to in-person work soon.
MacPherson also said working remotely has had benefits, including eliminating her commute time and enabling her to adjust her schedule based on her workload.
Still, she said she found remote work socially isolating. Especially later in the pandemic, she said she felt her life consisted of waking up, turning on her computer, and sitting in a chair.
Smack, who wants to remain remote in New York, said he appreciates the flexibility of remote work.
“It’s definitely opened my eyes to the fact that having this choice [of remote work] is very helpful for some people, and I hope that it does change the workforce moving forward, that people have more opportunities,” Smack said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Building off of a statement win against Brown two weeks ago, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team continued its recent strong play by outlasting the University of New Hampshire, 3-2, last Tuesday at the Whittemore Center.
The victory moved the No. 9/10 Crimson to 7-3-0 (4-3-0 ECAC) and sent the team into the Thanksgiving break on a two-game win streak.
After a strong opening period for Harvard — which saw freshman forward Paige Lester score her first career goal 15 minutes in — the Wildcats threatened in the second but were ultimately held in check before the Crimson were able to put distance between the two teams in the third period to secure the victory.
“A win’s a win,” Harvard head coach Katey Stone said after the game. “Whether it’s a pretty win, an ugly win. … On the road it’s tough to win. And so gutting out a victory on the road is a really good thing. Good teams find a way to do it.”
Entering the road contest, the Crimson was undefeated against non-conference opponents. However, two of its three losses occurred away from the home fans at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The matchup also pitted Coach Stone against her alma mater. While at UNH, she captained the women’s hockey team, leading the Wildcats to two conference championships. Heading into this game, her 40th matchup against her former team, she held an 18-16-5 record all-time.
After a 10-day layoff, the Crimson wasted no time settling into the game. Despite losing the opening faceoff, they dominated possession and fired eight shots within the first six minutes of the game. Harvard received its first advantage at the 6:54 mark, when UNH received a two-minute penalty for hooking. Although the Crimson had a five-on-four advantage, it was unable to capitalize on any of its three shots during the power play. After failing to convert on early chances, the Crimson got onto the board first thanks to Lester’s goal 15 minutes into the first frame. The forward guided a pass from senior forward Brooke Jovanovich into the goal, putting Harvard up 1-0.
The Wildcats came roaring back to life in the second period. Its 15 shots were nearly double the nine shots that it fired in the first period. UNH was presented with its best chance when it went on the power play after a minor penalty by Harvard. But the Crimson held the Wildcats to just one shot and killed off the advantage, generating momentum to build on going into the third period. Senior goalie and captain Becky Dutton kept the shutout alive by saving six shots in the period.
After a dull second period, the Crimson offense returned to its first-period form. Senior forward Becca Gilmore scored early in the third period to extend the Crimson’s lead to 2-0. The goal was her seventh of the season — the most on the team.
“A lot of that has to do with the chemistry I have with my line,” Gilmore said of her high-level play. “Generating chances by just creating great opportunities from both Anne Bloomer and Kristin Della Rovere there. And then obviously when the puck keeps going into the net for us, you can build confidence game to game and you really don’t think about it much and you just play the game of hockey.”
Three minutes later, UNH responded with a goal by sophomore forward Nicole Kelly. Over the next seven minutes, each team failed to convert their power play chances. With five minutes left in the period, Harvard senior forward Keely Moy fired a shot into the goal to give the Crimson a two-goal advantage.
UNH junior forward Jada Christian scored a goal in the waning minutes of the third period, but Harvard was able to hold on for the 3-2 win.
Coach Stone attributed much of the team’s success to the stellar play of its goaltender, Dutton, who made 19 saves in the game.
“I think Becky Dutton played really well for us today,” Stone said. “[She] made the saves we needed her to make. We kind of left her out to dry a little bit a couple times and we just need to be better in front of her. But I thought she did a great job and we just kept grinding it out.”
The Crimson will return to Bright-Landry to face Union (2-14-1, 0-8, ECAC) and RPI (5-12, 2-6 ECAC) on Dec 3-4. Harvard will seek to build its winning streak against a pair of struggling conference opponents.

As someone not native to the East Coast (yes, finally someone not from New York), fall has a different meaning. As a Southern Californian, fall used to mean pulling on a light cardigan and sipping on an iced pumpkin spice latte. So the start of the New England fall was a rude awakening — WHY IS IT ALREADY COLD?!? As the weather just gets colder and colder, here are some tips to get us through this weather.
Manifest that you are in California.
Close your eyes in your roach-infested dorm room and pretend that you are back in Southern California. Take out your Amethyst crystal, and rub it maybe? Not too sure how the whole TikTok crystal thing works... Perhaps forget your hatred for Zoom, and try a virtual background.
Bring out the 5-pound coat early.
Don't be ashamed. Bring out the thick winter coat (or dare I say Canada Goose) and the never-ending layers. You bought it for this reason. Pro tip: don’t stop until your body is completely hidden under a mountain of clothes. Maybe you’ll be the sore thumb in a sea of shorts and Birkenstocks. But hey, embrace your inner girlboss and keep warm.
Stand next to the warm spot by Canaday.
Have a class in the Science Center? If so, plug your nose and enjoy the gust of warm wind from the vent by Canaday on the way. This is the perfect place to stop right after or before a meal at Berg and contemplate life. Go ahead, make it official and put it in your G-Cal:
1:30-2 p.m. Stand in Front of Vent.
Complain to anyone that will hear it.
The tourists in the yard, the rat in your room, the “influencer” filming a day in the life, your mirror — the options are endless. In true Californian fashion, you can’t let anyone forget you are from California. Extra points if you can mention L.A. or the beach in your rant.
Think of the positives.
You’re not a Yale student.
While real cold weather is daunting, at least it calls for pumpkin-spiced everything and the once-in-a-lifetime experience of seeing a Canada Goose every 5 feet from now on. And don’t forget that you now have something to brag about every time you call friends and family back home — the aggressive winter is just another part of the ~transformative experience~ here at Harvard!
