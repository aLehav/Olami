After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UMass made the Harvard men’s soccer team work hard for the victory, but in the end the Crimson escaped with a win after a game-winning penalty kick in overtime by co-captain Scott Prozeller, 1-0. With the win on Friday evening, the Crimson (2-2) improves its record to .500 for the season.
Playing under the lights for the second time this season at the Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium, Harvard began the game by dictating the pace of play and pressing deep into Minutemen territory.  By the 18th minute of play, the Crimson had mustered three shots on goal and two corner kicks, and looked poised to score at any moment.
At 22:36, with freshman Michael Innocenzi driving towards the goal, UMass conceded a penalty to the Crimson after Innocenzi was tripped up by a Minutemen defender just inside the penalty area. When junior Brian Rogers stepping up to take his first penalty of the season, Harvard seemed assured of its first goal. But Rogers shockingly pulled the ball wide to the right, keeping the game scoreless.
But despite the penalty miss, Harvard showed no signs of letting up offensively. At the end of the first half, the Crimson continually challenged the UMass backline and outshot UMass, 6-0.
Throughout the second half, the Crimson continued to look confident and threatened UMass on a regular basis but getting a shot by the goalkeeper proved to be a difficult task. With the match still scoreless after regulation play, the game moved into overtime.
Two minutes into overtime with the Minutemen pressing into the Harvard penalty box, senior goalkeeper Austin Harms made a crucial save off a header to deny UMass what could have been a game-winning goal.
Less than five minutes later, the Crimson would have a game-winning scoring chance of its own after Michael Innocenzi was once again cut down inside the box, giving the home-side a chance to score.
Stepping up to the penalty spot this time was Scott Prozeller, who confidently buried the ball into the top-left corner of the net, giving Harvard the golden-goal victory.
The Crimson continues its two-game weekend on Sunday on the road against Vermont.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Minutes after the finish of Saturday’s race at Franklin Park, the Harvard men’s cross country team belted out a rendition of “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.” Though onlookers joked about the squad’s singing abilities, there was little doubt about the quality of the race that the team had just put together.
In what is considered to be the Crimson’s only home meet of the season, the Harvard cross country teams played host to a pair of conference rivals—Yale and Princeton. The men’s squad raced its way to a first-place finish, while the women fell to both the Tigers and Bulldogs.
Harvard sophomore James Leakos captured the individual title in the men’s dual meet, finishing the eight-kilometer race in an impressive 24:21.
“I thought it went really well for all of us,” Leakos said. “We came out here and we did what we wanted to do.”
According to Leakos, Crimson coach Jason Saretsky wanted his runners to push it, but not overexert themselves in the first five kilometers of the race. Leakos was able to change gears when he hit the five-kilometer mark, separating himself from a fairly large group of runners that formed shortly after the start.
“We went out in a nice, big pack,” Leakos said. “We had a lot more guys in that pack than Yale did. We were feeling great, so we were able to drop them, and that was that”
Harvard’s standout freshman, Billy Orman, was hot on Leakos’ heels in Saturday’s race, as he clocked in a time of 24:24 and provided the Crimson men with a one-two finish. Having a more experienced teammate with him helped Orman pace himself in an unfamiliar race.
“This was my first eight-kilometer race, so I didn’t really know what to expect,” Orman said. “When [Leakos] started breaking away, I decided that I’d try to stay with him.”
Meanwhile, Harvard senior Kailyn Kuzmuk led the way for the women’s squad. The Tinley Park, Ill. native finished in fourth place overall and was the only Crimson runner who turned in a top-10 finish.
“Our women didn’t have as good of a performance as our men’s team,” Saretsky said. “But there were definitely some positives. Kailyn Kuzmuk showed that she’s back in her form that got her to nationals two years ago.”
Behind Kuzmuk for Harvard were freshmen Alaina Alvarez and Viviana Hanley, who crossed the finish line in 14th and 17th places, respectively. Senior captain Kirsten Jorgenson was the team’s fourth runner. Jorgenson ran a personal-best 18:25 in the five-kilometer race, which was good for 20th place.
Saturday’s meet garnered an unusually high amount of fan support for the cross country team. The Harvard Athletic Department provided two free fan buses for students who wished to attend the meet and cheer on the Crimson squads. Among the spectators in attendance were members of the Harvard track team.
“It’s Harvard-Yale; this is a big meet,” said sophomore Dustin Brode, a shot putter on the track team. “We came out to support our future teammates, even though they aren’t technically our teammates for a couple of months.”
Though popular at basketball and football games, painted bodies and faces are certainly a rare sight at cross country meets.
Brode sported a crimson “V”  on his chest, as he and six other members of the track team emblazoned “Harvard” on their bodies.
“It’s fantastic,” Leakos said. “I was really happy with [the fans.] It really gives you a boost when you’re running along, and you’re hearing, ‘Go Harvard’ 10 times as much as you’re hearing ‘Go Yale.’ It just makes you run better.”
The Crimson’s victory on Saturday earned it the Main Memorial Trophy, named in honor of a former Yale cross country runner who was killed in World War II.
The history and tradition behind the Harvard-Yale rivalry was not lost on this year’s participants.
“There is so much tradition behind the meet,” Saretsky said. “Obviously, we were disappointed with losing to Yale last year. I was pleased with how our young guys went out there and executed and were able to bring the Main trophy back home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s field hockey team (2-2, 0-1 Ivy) dropped its first conference game of the year on Saturday, losing to Yale 5-1 at Johnson Field in New Haven, Conn.
The Bulldogs (2-3, 1-0) charged out of the gates, scoring three unanswered goals to take a commanding lead in the first half. Yale continued its dominance throughout the matchup, outshooting Harvard, 36-7.
“We had a tough start to the game,” co-captain Georgia McGillivray said. “I think the main thing is that Yale plays a similar style to us and they were just one step ahead of us in a lot of things especially in the first half. They were getting to the ball first and they were just one second quicker than us.”
The Bulldogs got on the board 12 minutes into the contest when sophomore Erica Borgo batted in a goal.
Yale sophomore Emily Schuckert broke the game open with two goals in the span of three minutes to push the Bulldog lead to 3-0 with 15 minutes remaining in the half.
In the second half Yale stretched its advantage to 5-0 with goals from junior Maddy Sharp and senior Mia Rosati.
Harvard co-captain Carly Dickson scored a goal off of a corner to put the Crimson on the board with six minutes left to play.

If  you're a freshman, you might have heard the name "Katalicious Def." The  real-life person behind this freshman propelled to minor celebrity by  Facebook is Katherine J. Zhou '15, who has made a bit of a splash thanks  to her unusual hobby: she pole dances. 
 Zhou confidently shoos off stereotypes of pole dancers as risque  entertainers. For her, the pursuit is all about exercise and fun. 
 The hobby first took root at a summer camp, where a fellow camper dared  her to dance around a pole. Zhou recalled, "I found myself interested  in it, so I went to the playground and did tricks on the fireman poles  and started teaching myself tricks."
 When a friend gave her a voucher for free classes at Boston Pole  Fitness, she seized the opportunity. Now she takes the T to the studio  to practice, two to five days every week.
"I  tell people I pole dance and have to explain that I am not a stripper.  My goal is to spread the word of pole fitness being a legitimate  exercise form," Zhou said. 
She  added that she first tried break dancing, but she could not perform  many of the moves and disliked the male-dominated atmosphere.
 Pole dancing, she said, "makes me feel better about the way my body  looks." She explained that pole dancers must wear skimpy attire because  they "need skin friction."
Since she took up the hobby, she said, she has started wearing more  revealing clothing outside of the gym too. "That's what I feel  comfortable in," she said.
 On her Facebook page, which hosts a reel of photos of her impressively  athletic moves, Zhou goes by the name "Katalicious Def (GET NAKED  BITCH)."
 She explained the provocative profile: "My parents didn't let me have a  Facebook. They would actually do searches, and I had to choose a name  they wouldn't think of."
 Zhou, a possible computer science concentrator who terms herself "a  huge nerd," was quick to note that her hobbies range far beyond pole  dancing, from Pokemon to photo manipulation. 
 Pole dancing, she said, is just one more activity that makes her feel good about herself.
