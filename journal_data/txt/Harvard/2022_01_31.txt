After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chloe Okuno’s thriller “Watcher” begins with American expatriate Julia (Maika Monroe) staring out a car window, half in wonderment, half in wistfulness as she rides through the unknown streets of Romania. She will soon realize, however, that to look out a window also means inviting others to look at her. Having just moved to Bucharest with her husband Francis (Karl Glusman), who often works long hours, Julia has nothing but time on her hands. She soon notices a silhouetted figure in the window across the street from their apartment, one who always seems to be staring directly at her: This unsettling revelation, compounded by talk of a serial murderer on the loose known for targeting women, makes Julia develop the creeping feeling that she’s in danger. With its somewhat formulaic and predictable story arc, “Watcher” doesn’t establish itself as a particularly innovative addition to the thriller genre. Still, Okuno uses meticulous camerawork to maintain a consistent undercurrent of suspense, eliciting fear in audiences even in the film’s most mundane moments.
With its disorienting shot framing, “Watcher” quickly sets an ominous tone and leaves viewers wondering who and what to trust. Okuno frequently positions her camera outside a window and slowly zooms out on her characters, eerily suggesting that our protagonists aren’t alone even in their most intimate moments. While the stalker plot of “Watcher” is relatively simple, it’s engrossing in the way that it portrays normal everyday activities as potentially sinister. When Julia waves to the silhouette across the street in an attempt to figure out if she’s actually being watched, there’s a painfully tense delay before the shadowy figure slowly raises their hand in greeting. Julia is not in immediate danger during this simple moment, yet the way Okuno turns an objectively friendly interaction into a hair-raising one is commendable.
There are few prominently featured characters in “Watcher” beyond Julia and Francis. Even when Julia leaves her apartment, wandering the city alone as a sort of flaneur, the streets of Bucharest are not bustling with crowds. When she goes to the movies, she is one of just a few audience members; when she goes to a cafe, she is one of the only customers. In portraying the city as sparsely populated, the film’s setting becomes influential in establishing its unsettling tone. Even when Julia’s in public, she doesn’t feel safe, and the audience is keenly aware of her vulnerability; wide shots of these largely unoccupied spaces are frequently used to emphasize her isolation.
Julia’s anxieties about being watched are exacerbated by a sinister encounter during a showing of the Audrey Hepburn classic “Charade.” The solo trip to the movies becomes a tense experience when someone sits directly behind her in a mostly empty theater, their breathing even and loud. When Julia leaves, she’s convinced this mysterious man has followed her to the supermarket. Thus begins a rather frustrating subplot of the film in which many people, especially her husband, don’t take Julia’s concerns about being stalked seriously. Despite the fact that women are being targeted by a murderer in their city, Francis doesn’t seem sufficiently worried that his wife is in danger. Glusman is well cast as the dismissive[,] everything-is-fine character that horror films often rely on to further isolate their protagonist; he captures the arrogant nonchalance of a man negating a woman’s fears with ease.
Julia isn’t a particularly detailed protagonist — there’s a throwaline line or two revealing that she recently gave up on her ambition of being an actress — but Maika Monroe allows her to feel like a realistic and likable character nonetheless. Further context on her life and her relationship with Francis would have deepened the story and complicated these often trope-consistent characters. “Watcher” seems more focused on setting its audience on edge than developing its characters — which, to its credit, it does well.  In spite of her underwritten character, Monroe poignantly captures Julia’s increasing desperation and loneliness as she is made to feel like she’s crazy, helping to anchor and uplift a well-made but largely unremarkable thriller. “Watcher” won’t keep you up at night or stir conversation, but it does keep you anxiously entertained during its runtime.

When director Alika Tengan’s first longform feature “Every Day in Kaimukī” premiered at Sundance on Sunday, he told the audience that the project was “a love letter to Honolulu, to Kaimukī, and to the AAPI community here.” Indeed, this unassuming film pulses with a quiet, ruminative love for those communities and the stories they carry. The result is a tender, atmospheric indie that draws on the real lives of its mostly non-professional actors to immerse viewers in the fine-grained world of the titular Hawaiian neighborhood.
The film opens at night, and much of its action continues to take place after the sun sets on O’ahu. Naz (Naz Kawakami, playing an exaggerated version of himself) is a night DJ at a community radio station and spends his daylight hours skating at Kaimukī Park. Though his ties to the neighborhood, and to Hawai’i at large, run deep, he plans to move to New York with his girlfriend Sloane (Rina White), who has been accepted into the ceramics program at the Pratt Institute.
When we meet Naz in the booth, he’s on the air musing on Richard Hell and artistic communities in New York, calling Kaimukī his equivalent of the famed New York bar CBGB. A new DJ-in-training shows up and Naz gives him a hard time for his underbaked musical canon. It’s a modest scene that sets up the thrum of competing forces in Naz’s head — he’s excited by the prospect of proving himself in New York, but wary of relinquishing his comfortable place in the neighborhood that’s formed the contours of his adult life thus far. The film is loosely tentpoled around the arrival of this new DJ and the approaching date of the move, as Naz grapples with his strained relationship with Sloane, his own elusive sense of being “from” a place, and what it might mean to feel at home.
If the plot is light, it’s somewhat besides the point. Naz’s radio show is called “Night Drive,” which would double as an apt title for the movie based solely on vibe. Tengan and cinematographer Chapin Hall wash their mise-en-scène in moody purples and blues, fading sunlight to a warm sepia beige and casting the landscape in a roaming haze. This visual scheme evokes both an affective dreamlike nostalgia and a sense of listless complacency, mirroring Naz’s attachment to what he’s leaving behind as well as the roots of his desire to do so. The camerawork is intimate and lyrical as the film follows Naz’s days around Kaimukī: Like Naz himself, the lens is languid in its movement but meticulous in its attention. An evocative tone poem emerges — of place, of community, of millennial antsiness anchored in a granular tableau.
The score, too, could come straight from the effortlessly cool record shelves of the radio station. Holden Mandrial-Santos — a close collaborator of Tengan’s who also stars in the film as the interloping new DJ Kayden — nails the onscreen melancholia, or rather co-creates it, with a curated playlist of lo-fi tunes that puts indie darlings like Nilüfer Yanya and Tei Shi alongside music from the artistic projects of the actual actors in the film, including Hapa Hunting and Goon Lei Goon. Dashed with Madrial-Santos’ own whimsical compositions, it’s a score fit for a night drive to anywhere.
But this is not a film about anywhere, or anyone. Tengan, the first Native Hawaiian filmmaker to premiere a full-length feature at Sundance, is committed to amplifying the lived experiences of his milieu, and the film’s hyperlocality is both an uncomplicated reflection of a real place — the film was able to shoot in the neighborhood’s actual record stores and parks — and a radical rebuttal of reductive storytelling about the Hawaiian islands that sees only beaches and tourists. (Indeed, neither appears once in the film.)
The cast is also composed largely of neighborhood locals from Naz’s own friend group. Kawakami and Tengan are friends who have long wanted to make a movie together and co-wrote the script, much of which was ultimately improvised on set. The impetus for this version of a shared project was, in fact, the real Naz’s impending move to New York, where he now resides and Zoomed in from for Sundance. The result is an effectively lived-in cinéma vérité, particularly in the improvised scenes of casual conversation. Kawakami has a natural, mellow charisma and commands the screen with ease.
The dearth of professional actors may be a factor for why scripted dialogue is not the film’s strong suit. The atmosphere is harshed, and credibility strained, when the movie demands the most of its stars to advance the plot, notably in tensions between Naz and Sloane. While White does her best to bring multidimensionality to her character — the only female lead — she’s written as somewhat shrill, unreasonable, and even uncompassionate toward her partner, ultimately flattening into a plot device for Naz.
Nonetheless, “Every Day in Kaimukī” is stunning and melodic in its most naturalistic moments, and hopefully marks a breakout for Tengan. When asked if he planned to move to L.A. anytime soon, the director said that there were endlessly more stories he wanted to tell in his hometown first. Lucky for us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Written and directed by Krystin ver Linden, the slave drama “Alice” plays out like a narrative reversal of Octavia Butler’s classic 1979 novel “Kindred.” While Butler’s book tells the story of a 20th century woman who time travels to a plantation in the Antebellum south, “Alice” poses the question: What if the opposite were to occur, and a woman is not stripped of her freedom but gains it instead? In ver Linden’s directorial debut, Keke Palmer stars as the titular Alice, who is bewildered to find herself in 1970s Georgia after escaping from slavery. Though the film fumbles in its attempt to deliver an impactful message on the ongoing fight for liberation, its compelling premise makes for an engrossing story only strengthened by Palmer’s commanding performance.
A significant portion of “Alice” takes place on what viewers believe to be a nineteenth century plantation. Along with her husband Joseph (Gaius Charles) and other enslaved people, Alice lives in a threadbare cabin, works tirelessly in the fields, and suffers abuse from her captor, the violent and cruel Paul (Jonny Lee Miller). Given these circumstances, it comes as a shock when, after an altercation with Paul, Alice runs through the woods and suddenly finds herself stumbling upon a highway. Stunned by the unfamiliarity of the landscape, she is nearly hit by several cars and faints in the middle of the road. This is when she meets Frank (Common), a Black activist and passerby who takes it upon himself to help her.
What makes “Alice” intriguing is that it is not actually a story of time travel, contrary to what audiences might initially assume. Alice soon learns that she and other Black people were kept as slaves deep in the woods while all along it was the year 1973, and unbeknownst to them slavery had been abolished for over a century. It’s a premise with exciting potential, and at first the transition from the nineteenth century-style plantation to the modernity of 1970s urban Georgia evokes a thrilling dissonance. The film almost doubles as a nostalgia piece as Alice learns about the culture and technology of the ‘70s: Frank plays Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground” for her on his record player, and they go to see Pam Grier’s Blaxploitation film “Coffy” in theaters. The subgenre was popular in the ‘70s for its empowered Black leads that were simultaneously reliant on damaging stereotypes of Blackness, with their protagonists often engaging in crime and violence. Like many Black moviegoers in that decade, Alice is inspired by Coffy’s confidence and autonomy.
While these scenes showcasing the pop culture of the era provide some surface-level excitement, the script loses its ingenuity soon after Alice joins urban society. While Frank is at work one day, Alice spends hours poring over books — Paul had taught her to read so she could entertain him — learning about the decades of history that were hidden from her. A montage sequence featuring radicals like Malcolm X and Fred Hampton is shown, but not much more is done to draw parallels between nineteenth century oppression and the racism that persisted into the 1970s. Alice keeps marveling that she and other Black people are free, but her revelation ultimately feels like an oversimplification of race relations in the ‘70s, which remained a far cry from egalitarianism. The civil rights movement is certainly alluded to, but instances of modern-day inequalities aren’t shown or discussed with the depth they deserve. Although the premise of “Alice” offers a welcome opportunity to make incisive commentary on the centuries-long fight for Black liberation, the film ultimately falls short of this potential.
Furthermore, Alice’s character development isn’t very steady or realistic upon her realization that she should have been free her entire life. In the span of just a couple of days, she transitions from a perpetually disoriented state, in which she depended on Frank to explain modern technology to her, to the unflinching confidence and determination of the lead in a Blaxploitation movie. Moreover, once Alice decides she wants to free her fellow slaves who are still sequestered in the woods, the film hits predictable and relatively cheap story beats: She has a makeover where she comes out resembling Pam Grier, and she and Frank hit the library to plan out their mission. It’s satisfying to see Alice grow more empowered as the story progresses, but the story feels tonally incoherent as it attempts to pay homage to Blaxploitation films while still trying to ground itself in a sense of seriousness.
These flaws in character and story development, however, are no fault of Palmer’s. In a significant departure from her usually more comedic roles, she captivates as Alice. While her character arc feels rushed, Palmer still moves seamlessly through the multiplicity of emotions Alice feels in her journey from bondange to freedom. When living on the plantation under the constant threat of Paul’s cruelty, she trembles with a tangible fear; when watching TV for the first time, asking “Are those small people?”, she emotes an endearing sense of wonder. When she decides to save her loved ones from bondage, Palmer’s face sets with an immovable resolve. While the script falls short in many ways — believability, character development, and pacing, to name a notable few — Palmer grounds the story with her impressive emotional range. Ultimately, “Alice” is not a particularly groundbreaking or insightful film. However, it does offer an empowering, if surface-level, story that leaves audiences wondering what else Palmer is capable of.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New spring, new term, new Covid policies — you know the drill. As of this semester, Harvard, in a sharp departure from previous terms, will no longer provide isolation housing for infected students or coordinate a broad-based contact tracing effort. Instead, students who test positive for Covid-19 will be required to self-isolate in their rooms and notify their close-contacts from their newfound, in-house confinement.
While initially shocking, we consider the University’s shift to be in accordance with the pandemic’s own shifting nature. After almost 400 million cases worldwide, Covid-19 now seems on track to become an endemic threat: a constant virological presence in our communities. Endemics vary in location and severity, spanning everything from malaria to the simple common flu; they are public health threats that, while challenging to society in their own right, are no longer characterized by the disruptiveness and unpredictability that defined the first few waves of Covid-19. If present trends continue, we will eventually have to adapt and coexist with Covid.
Against this epidemiological backdrop, Harvard’s latest policy choices start to make sense. That, too, is not surprising — since the dawn of the pandemic, the administration’s approach has been vindicated time and time again. Harvard, an institution in communication with epidemiologists from all over the world, has generally been right in the past in crafting Covid-19 policies, erring, if anything, on the side of caution. Case counts on campus have, in fact, remained commendably low throughout the course of the pandemic. As Covid-19 propagates in the form of the more transmissible but less severe Omicron variant, a shift in policy must accompany the shift in the nature of the virus. The University must strike a balance between the logistically feasible and epidemiologically ideal.
That’s not to say that Harvard should abandon containment efforts altogether. The University’s decision to close dining halls for the first two weeks and retain indoor masking, for example, reflects its enduring and laudable commitment to student safety, more lenient isolation policies notwithstanding. The question, then, is whether those efforts will be enough, particularly for those members of our community who are most likely to suffer severely from a Covid-19 infection. Will this change in policy unduly endanger our immunocompromised peers, elderly professors and Harvard University Dining Services staff, and any other Harvard affiliates at elevated risk? The answer seems, at best, uncertain.
As such, Harvard should provide more assurance that immunocompromised students will have access to the College’s limited alternative housing. Isolating in place with a Covid-positive roommate places all of us in harm’s way; for the immunocompromised, the potential risks can be terrifyingly higher. While eligible students with elevated risk for complications are said to have priority for these slots, Harvard must prove in its execution that these students will, in fact, receive fair treatment and priority access.
Moreover, with an inflated number of cases on campus, it is imperative that infected students have access to structured academic support. A positive result should not cause a student to fall behind academically at a university that has an abundance of resources available. There must be a systematized way to ensure access to classes outside of shared PowerPoint presentations and iPhone recordings.
Above all, as the University continues to make changes to Covid-19 protocols, their execution of said policies must be efficient. This is not the time for vague emails about “troubling and unprecedented times.” Harvard has a responsibility to clearly communicate why decisions are being made while acknowledging the efficacy and potential downfalls of the measures they put in place. This may include the recognition that they don’t always know precisely what is best.
Crucially, this burden does not fall entirely on the University: We must hold ourselves individually accountable. Even as Harvard’s isolation policy changes in line with Covid-19, we must keep up with common-sense mitigation strategies like KN95 masks and stringent testing enforcement in order to keep our community safe. Given the most recent changes in contact-tracing policy, students who test positive have an obligation to personally notify everyone they may have exposed to Covid-19. This action is not only quick, intuitive, and necessary — it’s also, quite simply, the right thing to do.
The Covid-19 pandemic has placed a series of unexpected hurdles in the path of everyone for nearly two full years, and in large part, we — students, faculty, and administrators alike — have adjusted accordingly. As we look ahead to a spring semester where the prominence of Covid-19 remains an unfortunate reality, we must all continue to play our part to ensure the success of Harvard’s ever-shifting policies and to keep one another safe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s newest Covid-19 policies — revised in preparation for a spring semester darkened by the tumultuous clouds of the surging Omicron variant — are the administration's most careless decision yet in regard to the pandemic. These new measures differ in key ways from the University's previous approach: Students who test positive will now “isolate” in their rooms, and the University has declined to guarantee isolation housing to those who request it. Contact tracing, it seems, is now up to us; the University will no longer inform the close contacts of students who test positive.
Rising case rates on campus and beyond certainly complicate Harvard’s mitigation policies, but Harvard’s new approach seems, to us, too close to giving up. Among our peers, even Yale College’s updated Covid-19 policies clearly guarantee that roommates of those who test positive will be able to obtain isolation housing. In contrast, Harvard’s vague language — which emphasizes that alternative housing is “limited” and “not guaranteed” — is far from reassuring, especially for immunocompromised students who rely on the safety provided by isolation housing more than others. Considering Harvard’s many properties on and around campus, we find it hard to believe that the University has run out of other options.
Meanwhile, delegating contact tracing to those infected puts an important responsibility in the hands of a student body that has shown itself too willing to disobey safety guidelines. Whenever Harvard has set a bar for its Covid-19 policies, students have managed to limbo right under it. Public health on our campus is not an individual problem; it shouldn’t be left up to individuals alone to solve.
What underlies Harvard’s entire non-strategy, in our view, is a thread of Covid-19 fatalism, if not outright indifference. It seems to us that there are two ways to interpret Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen’s recent email where he cites “the unprecedented number of cases within our community that we must support,” only to announce that university-coordinated contact tracing and isolation housing have been effectively eliminated. The first is that Harvard, of all places, cannot financially or logistically support the increased demand for contact tracing and isolation housing; the second is that the University believes the risk of Covid-19 to be so high that mitigation is no longer worth pursuing. Given the meteoric rise of the University’s endowment last year, how are we to believe anything other than the latter?
When our board endorses Harvard’s decision, this is what they claim to agree with: Two years in, the raging pandemic is simply no longer worth the effort.
The country thinks of Harvard as the gold standard in higher education — Harvard likes to think so, too. But assuming that role comes with a lot of responsibility, and Harvard’s words and actions are widely reported. Because of this, the ramifications of Harvard’s Covid-19 policy extend far beyond Cambridge. The implications of policies like these have been discussed by scholars since the start of the pandemic. The brunt of their apathy falls squarely on the elderly, the uninsured, and others who cannot afford (financially or otherwise) infection, and this is as true on campus as it is everywhere else. Besides the community of exceptional faculty and staff who support us, many of whom are older, this burden will primarily be felt by our immunocompromised peers, medically vulnerable and already overburdened by pandemic-related anxiety. The saddest part about all of this, though, is that if Harvard’s policy fails, it likely won’t be students or even staff who’ll face the worst consequences. Instead, it will be vulnerable members of communities — workers in Harvard Square, our homeless neighbors, young schoolchildren — who interact with ours.
By shifting the weight of responsibility onto students, Harvard hasn’t just weakened community-level counter Covid-19 efforts; it has also conveniently positioned itself to escape blame in the inevitable wake of its neglect. What is perhaps most frustrating about Harvard’s new policy is its insincerity: the masking of institutional indifference as pragmatic adjustment that allows Harvard to act as though we will all get Covid-19 while claiming to protect us from it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 1, 2022 at 5:15 a.m.
As people poured into Harvard Square to celebrate Biden clinching the presidency (or more honestly, Trump’s defeat), I saw a man pop a bottle of champagne and pour it into plastic little cups for smiling onlookers. One looked 10. As his little hands clenched the cup, cars honked as they passed the tangle of bodies lining JFK St. One waved a Biden-Harris flag out the window. The crowd cheered; whoever brought a cowbell rang it. So many people came carrying something — a hand-written sign, a flag. All I had in my hands was a jacket.
It was surprisingly warm for November. And as I walked along the Charles later that day with some friends I’d bumped into – the first from college I’d seen since the pandemic struck – one managed to articulate what exactly hung in the air. 2020 had been a strange, fearful, and above all, quiet year. The day was the first time in a long time we’d seen a group of people happy.
Still, something I’d seen during the celebration was so disquieting it put a lump of shame in my throat. In the center of the crowd, about 10 feet from a Black Lives Matter flag tied to a stop light, was a homeless man laid out on top of a small heap of trash bags. I recognized him from walks to class. As people wooed and cheered, they crowded him. I watched, wary he’d be trampled. I didn’t expect people to stop celebrating or to lend him any sort of hand; who knew if he even wanted to be disturbed. But to see so many people act not just as if he was dead, but as if this man did not even exist, unnerved me.
I don’t mean to moralize. I didn’t do anything but feel bad – told myself that even if I approached the man, he’d never hear me over the honking and, really, what did I have to say? But, for the rest of the day, I mostly thought of the limits of what everyone had come to the Square to celebrate.
I drove up to college having never visited, figuring Cambridge was El Dorado. Henry N. Lear ’24, administrative director of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, says that’s typical.
“A lot of students kind of look around and are really surprised at the fact that there's an incredible amount of homelessness all around us,” he says.
We’re talking in the middle of an especially hectic day for him. The weekend’s blizzard, which brought a record-breaking two feet of snow, is a day away, and HSHS is supersaturating its capacity to bring in more guests. On nights when weather can kill, “it’s kind of built into our policy” Henry says, “to set out five additional cots in our main space where our guests eat.”
Harvard’s student-run homeless shelters, HSHS and Y2Y, have reduced capacity by about 20 percent since reopening amid the pandemic.
“We’re hoping to bump up to 19” for the storm, Henry tells me.
Shelters have had to take as many people as they can while keeping beds reasonably distanced. James R. “Jim” Stewart, director of First Church Shelter in Cambridge, reminds me: “Folks who are living on the street are not necessarily hale and healthy to start with.” An outbreak could rip through their guests.
But even after the pandemic ends, Cambridge's shelter capacity will remain too small. Every day, HSHS and Y2Y hold a lottery to determine who will occupy the available of their 15 and 22 beds, respectively, and every day, students tell Cambridge residents they can’t offer them shelter. Xi Wu, a senior at Wellesley College that goes by Franny, is HSHS’s Technology Director. She breaks the system down for me; I feel naive for being horrified.
“The winners of the beds are determined through three daily lotteries,” Franny explains.
Monday, Thursday, and Sunday mornings, November to April, HSHS lotteries its available long-term beds to Cambridge’s homeless.
“And a lot of people are interested because it's like the jackpot. You get it and you can stay for three weeks,” Franny says.
At 9 p.m. and again at 11 p.m., if there are no shows, one-day beds are distributed daily.
When I ask Franny if she’s ever had to personally tell someone she couldn’t offer them a place to stay, she seems surprised by the question.
“Yeah, yeah. I mean, you have to do that.”
The number denied always varies, but there’s bad news every day. To try and make the process less personal, HSHS assigns every unhoused person a number, and then, like the local news, reads the winning lotto numbers out; sometimes by phone, sometimes in person.
“There’s this feeling of elation and you’re satisfied when you’re calling somebody and saying, ‘Yes, Mike, you won a bed,’ especially if it’s a guest you’re familiar with,” Franny tells me. “You know how much it means to them.” But, too often, the news is bad. “Sometimes guests get confused,” she says, and offer their names and assigned numbers again as she explains what the mismatch between their number and those she read out means. “More experienced guests just ask for the number and, you know, hang up if they didn’t win it. And you’re left with a little bit of emptiness.”
No shelter is meant to serve as a permanent solution. The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter in particular was designed to serve as an emergency respite for those who suddenly find themselves homeless – maybe because they were evicted, or fled an abusive partner. The shelter will protect you, feed you, and house you to its absolute capacity, but ultimately, each aims to get its guests to a place where they’re no longer needed.
To do this, HSHS and most other shelters connect guests with case workers who can help them find a job, better-paying work (many HSHS guests work jobs too low-paying to afford Cambridge housing), and access government aid they qualify for. For many, this means applying for disability and, crucially, a housing voucher.
But this model, in which shelters like HSHS serve as a band-aid until people can access more permanent resources, is utterly broken.
“Sometimes on Christmas you have HSHS alumni from 20 years ago come and volunteer with us, and those people look at the roster and will say, ‘I recognize these guests from 20 years ago,’” Franny tells me. “And a lot of them have stayed with us for years and years.”
I asked Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, in typical long-winded fashion, why. Why are Cambridge’s shelters chronically overwhelmed? How do people end up lotterying for a bed for years, and sleeping on the street?
His answer is short: “Because we don’t have enough housing.”
A housing voucher, something often given to city’s disabled, elderly, and poorest families, helps cover “the gap between what you can pay yourself and what the actual cost of leasing is,” he explains.
Unfortunately, the average wait between securing a voucher and having a roof over your head can be up to six years.
“Right now, if you tried to get on the waiting list for that type of housing, you’re looking at a waiting list of 20,000 people ahead of you,” Zondervan tells me.
Cambridge’s shocking price of housing is to blame — which is to say that Harvard, at least partly, is too. The average rent in Cambridge is $3,145, per a 2o16 report. That makes Cambridge housing 280 percent higher than the national average, placing it among America’s most expensive.
It’ll only get higher. Harvard, just named the city’s top employer for the 22nd straight year, continues to draw new residents in. As of 2020, pre-pandemic, a seismic 60,292 Harvard affiliates — students, staff, and faculty — were based in the city. While most undergraduates occupy on-campus housing, graduate students and other employees in Harvard’s ecosystem buy and rent in Cambridge. And mounting housing demand — in a city with no rent control, and zoning laws strangling efforts to increase supply — has made prices rocket.
Federal housing vouchers only cover up to a set amount of rent. To afford market rent with a voucher, essentially "you've gotta find someone in the Cambridge, Somerville, Boston area who wants to take a fixed amount of money when they could probably get more money by making the apartment available to a couple of college students, right, or a software engineer," Stewart, who assists guests with vouchers, says.
This is the hot market Cambridge’s poor, disabled, and low-wage workers lose out in.
Zondervan talks me through a typical scenario: “Market rent is $3,000, but the voucher only covers up to $2,000.”
Most of Cambridge’s unhoused, unable to cover the difference, can then only use their vouchers at housing units managed by the Cambridge Housing Authority, which have fixed, affordable housing. This housing is incredibly scarce. “So a lot of times these voucher holders end up being excluded from the market,” Zondervan says.
As they spend years on a public housing wait list, they’re effectively excluded from housing entirely.
Harvard has acknowledged its role in Cambridge’s housing crisis. It’s 20/20/2000 initiative committed $20 million from 2000 to 2020 to establish low-interest loans for affordable housing units (which, “for reference’s sake,” Zondervan says, “would buy you, maybe, 40 units of housing today.”) Since that program elapsed, HSHS and Y2Y, two student-run programs, have been Harvard’s most consistent effort to offset the housing crisis.
Harvard gave $250,000 in 2020 to help turn a high school into an emergency shelter after Covid forced Cambridge shelters to close and shrink capacity. The city certainly needs not only more, but better shelters — non-congregate, safe, and with low barriers to entry. But a renewed investment in creating affordable housing is required if Harvard truly wants to invest in Cambridge, the city it’s been molding since 1637. With help from the world’s richest university, the day could come when Cambridge shelters don’t have to lottery off beds. I can’t think of a better cause to put the University’s surprise $283 million budget surplus towards.
H. Orlando Patterson, a sociology professor, coined the term social death to refer to “the condition of people not accepted as fully human by wider society” – those whose suffering we pretend not to see. But as good as we’ve gotten at diverting our eyes, we all see this crisis; in the reflective blankets that cover those who sleep under the awning that dresses the Coop, in the woman who spends her nights by the Canaday heating vent.
The Cambridge police headquarters opened its lobby as an emergency shelter for the unhoused during the blizzard according to Zondervan; an inherent acknowledgement of the city's insufficient shelter, and of our responsibility to help the most vulnerable. “When there’s a storm or a pandemic, everybody agrees that that’s true,” Zondervan says.
But when the storm passes, we forget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 31, 2022 at 2:18 a.m.
Rail service along the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority’s Red Line was suspended for over five hours Sunday following a “medical emergency” at the Harvard T station involving “a person under a train,” the MBTA tweeted.
Shortly after 5 p.m. Sunday, first responders swarmed the Harvard T station and the MBTA halted trains in both directions. During the closure, shuttles replaced regular rail service between the Alewife and Park Street stations.
According to MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo, Red Line service was restored at 10:35 p.m. after investigators departed, having cleared the scene.
The status and identity of the individual under the train remained unclear as of Sunday evening.
Passengers reported delays resulting from incident. Finn M. Gardiner, a disability advocate, said he was stranded at the Harvard Square station for over an hour waiting for shuttle service after the incident halted his train.
“We were being ushered outside to the streets in the bitter cold onto sidewalks that were not completely shoveled because of yesterday's blizzard, and that’s not ADA compliant,” Gardiner, who himself is disabled, said. “I should not have had to lift my walker up the curb to look for buses that haven’t even arrived yet.”
Carol J. Simon was riding the outbound train when officials told her to vacate the station. Due to the cold weather, Simon — who is disabled — remained in the lobby just outside the turnstiles into the station. She was told that the next train would arrive in “a couple of hours.”
Roommates Ryan H. Doan-Nguyen ’25 and Abhi S. Patel ’25 planned to take the T to Boston’s Chinatown to dine at their favorite Thai restaurant, but were surprised to find caution tape blocking their path to the inbound rail.
Doan-Nguyen, a Crimson multimedia editor, said he almost could not believe the announcement in the station that the Red Line had been closed due to a person under the train.
Patel said his first thoughts were of the Jan. 15 murder of Michelle A. Go, who was pushed to her death in front of a New York City subway train.
“I was thinking, you know, is this like a copycat attack or something?” Patel said.
“I was really worried that it was a hate crime as well,” Doan-Nguyen added. “Just the uptick in attacks against Asian Americans and in cities like New York and Boston — you never really know what might have happened.”
John L. Pulice, a Ph.D candidate at Harvard Medical School, wrote in an email that when he arrived at Kendall Square station shortly after 6 p.m., the station was closed with over thirty people waiting outside to travel in each direction.
“People shouted that they had been waiting for [90 minutes] in the freezing cold for a shuttle bus to no avail,” Pulice wrote. “We received no information otherwise about when or if a shuttle bus would eventually come.”
Spokespeople for the Cambridge Police Department and Massachusetts State Police deferred to the Transit Police and District Attorney’s office, respectively. Neither responded to requests for comment Sunday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of its new Covid-19 public health measures for the spring semester, Harvard will provide KN95 masks to students upon request.
Harvard has allotted 30 masks per student each month, according to an email from College spokesperson Rachael Dane. Freshmen can procure the masks from Yard Operations, and upperclassmen should request them from their house building managers.
The new policy by the University comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on face masks, clarifying that cloth masks offer the least protection against Covid, while KN95s and N95s offer the most.
Each school at the University will handle the KN95 mask distribution on its own, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton. He wrote in an email that the University set up contracts to purchase the masks, but the schools can use them “based on their supply needs.”
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in Wednesday email to affiliates that the school had seen a decline in its positivity rate compared to early January, when the Omicron variant led to a surge in Covid-19 cases.
“Looking ahead, public health experts anticipate the most recent Omicron-driven surge will be in decline in the coming weeks,” he wrote. “The policies and protocols we have put in place enable us to continue on-campus academic activities, while also keeping our community safe.”
Nguyen urged affiliates to wear high-quality masks, including a “surgical-style mask or a cup-style protective mask such as KN-95.” He noted the importance of finding a mask that is both airtight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
“Masks continue to be highly effective in reducing risk of transmission regardless of vaccine status,” Nguyen wrote.
Junior Aakash Mishra ’23 said he usually purchases his own KN95 masks but had not previously heard of the option to request them from the school.
“I would definitely request it because I mean, free masks, right?” he said. “I definitely need more, and I don't want to spend more money on it.”
Rhocar B. Constant ’24 said that he does not expect to request KN95 masks, but added that the option to request high-quality masks will be helpful to others on campus.
“I think that's dope for people that need that and would feel more comfortable with that,” he said. “I don't think a lot of people use it, but I think the people that do use it will use it a lot.”
Correction: January 31, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated upperclassmen could pick up high-quality masks from their house administrators. In fact, they can pick up the masks from their house building managers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The dean of Harvard's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, discussed the launch of her new book at a virtual event hosted Friday evening.
Brown-Nagin’s book, “Civil Rights Queen: Constance Baker Motley and the Struggle for Equality,” is a biography of Constance Baker Motley, a trailblazing attorney and judge during the civil rights movement. The book was released on Jan. 25.
The book details Motley’s career as an activist and a lawyer, highlighting her experiences as a Columbia Law School student, working under Thurgood Marshall, and becoming one of the most eminent civil rights lawyers of her time.
Brown-Nagin said Motley took on a wide range of roles as a Black female lawyer.
“‘Motley morphed from lawyer to therapist, a role she often played in high stakes civil rights cases,’” Brown-Nagin quoted from her book.
Brown-Nagin said Motley dedicated her life to the civil rights movement and advocacy for gender equality, as well as mentorship.
“One of the things that I really admired about her is that she was the first but she made sure that she was not the last,” Brown-Nagin said.
“She hired law clerks, who had graduated from Harvard and Columbia, other prestigious institutions, but were not getting looks from other judges. She hired them, and she inspired them,” Brown-Nagin added.
Brown-Nagin said Motley’s persistence allowed her to become a lawyer and judge despite coming from a working class, immigrant household in New Haven, Connecticut.
“She wasn't meant to be a lawyer,” Brown-Nagin said. “Her parents were West Indian. They didn't have money even to send her to college, much less to law school.”
Brown-Nagin also discussed how Motley attended Columbia Law School — a male-dominated institution at the time — with the financial support of New Haven philanthropist Clarence Blakeslee.
“There were very few women, but she made it through, and she ended up being one of the lawyers who helped to make civil rights law,” said Brown-Nagin.
Brown-Nagin said she was driven to write the book because she felt it was important to tell the story of Motley.
“I have to say I was just determined to get it done, because I believed in the project so much,” Brown-Nagin said. “I thought it was worth my time and my effort to just make sure that Constance Baker Motley is as widely known as she deserves to be.”
Motley was nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as a successor to her mentor, Thurgood Marshall — a step that highlighted the recognition of civil rights activists at the time. Her alignment with the civil rights and prisoners’ rights movements as a Black female lawyer, however, proved to be a “double-edged sword,” according to Brown-Nagin: Motley was not selected for the role.
“Her identity was weaponized — to use a word that is tossed around today — against her,” Brown-Nagin said. “We need to ensure that that story about Motley is known and that that isn't replicated.”
Brown-Nagin also said Motley’s story is relevant given President Joe Biden’s recent pledge to nominate a Black woman to replace Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
“The [Biden] administration has to be prepared for the slings and arrows that will come, and they will come no matter how brilliant or how qualified the woman is, they will come and they need to be anticipated,” Brown-Nagin said. “I hope that telling Montley’s story will encourage people to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s nor’easter buried Cambridge in 14 inches of snow, offering students their first snowy day of 2022 — and for some students, their first snowstorm ever.
With libraries and gyms closed due to the snow, students took advantage of their extra time to embrace the outdoors by sledding, swimming, and even streaking through the snow.
Some students accustomed to warmer climates said they had never seen a snowstorm like Saturday’s.
Shwe Y. Win ’25, who has spent most of her life in Hawaii, said the storm was her first encounter with severe winter weather.
“I had never really experienced winter before, let alone snow,” she said. “Yesterday during the blizzard, I looked out the window, and it was very serene.”
Having grown up in Mexico, Jorge García Ponce ’25 said that he had witnessed his first snowfall on campus in November, but Saturday’s storm was his first blizzard.
García Ponce added that he spent almost the entire day outside in the snow, even sledding down the Widener steps using a trash can lid.
“Then we realized it wasn’t the best idea,” García Ponce said.
He said that some students then began using plastic signs or even mattresses instead.
One such student, Fasai “Prin” Pulkes ’25, said students were using any items available.
“We would just grab signs, or there were Annenberg trays as well,” she said. “There was snow at the bottom, so — crash landing!”
For members of Harvard Club Swimming, the storm presented a different kind of fun. Qijia Zhou ’24, a club member, joined a few of her teammates to take a dip in the snow in nothing but their swimsuits.
“Our club swim captain just called me and was like, ‘Hey, I know you’re in the quad, do you want to go for a snow swim?’” she said. “I was like ‘Of course, why not?’”
Pulkes added that she even saw some other students running through a snowy Harvard Yard “in their underwear.”
“I don’t know how they survived,” she said. “It was really cold.”
For those students who dared venture out to Harvard Square, a slew of store closings awaited.
Kelsey Chen ’25, a Texas native, went to the grocery store with her roommate “in the freezing cold” only to find it closed due to the storm.
“ We went out at nine in the morning in the freezing cold when nobody was out,” she said. “The store — it said it was open on Google Maps — was closed when we got there, so that was an experience which I had never been through before.”
In addition to store closures, Cambridge officials also responded by announcing a Snow Emergency Parking Ban, which prohibited drivers from parking on streets marked with “No Parking During Snow Emergency” signs between 11 p.m. Friday and 6 p.m. Sunday.
The Cambridge city government website documented more than 180 pieces of equipment working to clear the roads during the day on Saturday, and city workers continued clearing paths throughout the night.

In a longitudinal study over two decades in the making, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that Multiple Sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system, is “likely caused” by infection with Epstein-Barr virus.
The research study, a team effort led by Harvard Chan School Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition Dr. Alberto Ascherio, was published in the Jan. 13 issue of Science. It provides evidence in support of a longstanding theory that EBV is linked to the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis.
Signs of infection with Epstein-Barr virus, which affects over 90 percent of the adult population worldwide, have been found at high rates in MS patients by multiple previous studies, which suggests a connection between EBV and MS but is not conclusive evidence of a causal relationship.
“The idea that the EBV, the Epstein-Barr virus, is associated with multiple sclerosis has been around for many years, but the main problem is that EBV is nearly ubiquitous,” Dr. Ascherio said. “There is this curse of the ubiquitous exposure [to EBV] where it’s not that it cannot cause a rare disease, but it’s just difficult to prove.”
Over a 20 year time period, the researchers examined blood serum samples taken every two years from active-duty U.S. military personnel whose initial serum samples were negative for EBV. Ascherio explained that they were looking to establish the sequence of events for when patients first became infected with EBV and when they were diagnosed with MS.
“We found that they cannot get MS basically, unless they were first infected with Epstein-Barr Virus,” Ascherio said. “That clearly established that you first have to be infected [with EBV], then you can have the beginning of the pathological process that leads to MS.”
Ascherio said the study also represents a critical step towards eventually developing a cure for MS and improving upon the treatments currently available.
“The implication is that if we could prevent infection [with EBV], then we could prevent Multiple Sclerosis, so there is ongoing research on an EBV vaccine,” Ascherio said.
“We are collaborating with clinical investigators to explore the possibility of testing antiviral drugs in people with MS to see if those can improve treatment,” he added.
Despite the causal relationship between EBV and MS established by this study, developing MS is still relatively rare for people infected with EBV, according to Ascherio.
Dr. Ascherio also acknowledged the contributions of several key members of the project including Senior Research Scientist Kassandra L. Munger, and postdoctoral research fellows Kjetil Bjornevik and Marianna Cortese.

When Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer announced his retirement last week, Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 immediately rose to the top of many court watchers’ short lists as a potential replacement.
A judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Jackson is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School. Since 2016, she has also served on the Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body.
Breyer is set to step down as the court prepares to hear a slew of high-stakes cases — including a lawsuit against Harvard seeking to strike down affirmative action in American higher education. The court agreed last Monday to take up a pair of challenges to race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina.
If nominated, Jackson could face questions over a potential conflict of interest in the case.
Jackson, who was elected by Harvard alumni to a six-year term on the Board, is set to leave the body this year. The 31-member board provides input about the direction of the school and probes the quality of the University’s programs and initiatives.
Experts are divided on whether her position on the Board would warrant a recusal if she were confirmed to the bench.
Indiana University law professor Charles G. Geyh, an expert on judicial conduct and ethics, said a recusal should hinge on whether she was involved in implementing race-conscious admissions policies during her time in University governance.
“In her capacity as a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, if she was responsible for creating, implementing, or enforcing the policy that she is now being asked to review, I would probably argue that she should step aside in that situation,” Geyh said.
The Board of Overseers, one of two governing boards at Harvard, does not provide direct input on the school's admissions policies. There was no mention of the Board in a 130-page opinion issued by a federal judge in 2019 that detailed Harvard College's admissions process. The 13-member Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body, plays a larger role in overseeing the school's operations.
Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 said “there would be a strong argument that she would not need to recuse” if confirmed to the bench.
“On the Board of Overseers, neither she nor the other overseers would have had definitive say over the admissions process at the University,” he said.
But recusals often hinge on public perception, experts say.
“There’s the question of perception — public perception,” Feldman said. “For that reason, one could imagine her thinking seriously about whether she might want to recuse, so as to avoid any such perception, however mistaken that perception might be.”
Paul Bender ’54, an Arizona State University law professor, said Jackson’s time in Harvard governance could be reason enough for her to recuse herself from the case if she is nominated to the bench.
“I would imagine this Board of Overseers has some overseeing responsibility of the College and that would be enough for me to think that she should recuse herself,” he said.
President Joe Biden promised last week to replace Breyer by nominating the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. National media speculation has swirled around Jackson as a top contender, along with Leondra R. Kruger ’97 and J. Michelle Childs. If approved by the U.S. Senate, the nomination would not change the overall ideological bent of the court, which currently has a six-justice conservative majority.
The United States Code says members of the federal judiciary must disqualify themselves if their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” In the court's 2020 term, just one justice recused themself from a case after it was taken up, according to the watchdog group Fix the Court. Since 2015, justices have recused themself from a case at the merits stage just 22 times.
Even if Jackson played no role in overseeing Harvard’s admissions policies, “it is just the kind of thing that looks terrible,” Bender said.
Sanford V. Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said it would be “very dicey” if Jackson didn’t recuse herself.
“Judge Jackson is on the board even as we speak, and so it would seem to me that she would have some explaining to do if she didn’t recuse herself,” he said.
Harvard Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon Jr. wrote in an email he thinks Jackson would recuse herself in the case if confirmed.
“If Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson were a member of the Supreme Court, I think she very likely would have to recuse herself from the Harvard affirmative action case,” he wrote.
However, even if Jackson recused herself from the Harvard suit, Feldman said there is a distinct possibility she could retain her vote for the UNC suit — which he called constitutionally “more important” because UNC, as a public university, is a state actor.
Jackson did not respond to requests for comment.
At least one other sitting justice may also face calls to recuse themself from the SFFA case: Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife sits on the board of advisors of a conservative advocacy group that filed an amicus brief backing SFFA. Experts also noted that Justice Elena Kagan served as dean of Harvard Law School from 2003 to 2009 — but the SFFA suit specifically targets Harvard College's admissions process.
A single recusal would be unlikely to impact the outcome of a case given the court’s current six-justice conservative majority.
“Harvard cannot win unless it can somehow get the votes of two of those six,” Fallon wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust approved a funding request of nearly $7.4 million for an affordable housing development in the Neighborhood Nine area of Cambridge in a virtual meeting Thursday afternoon.
The trust — a fund established by the Cambridge City Council for low-income development — will finance a new 107-unit building at 52 New Street, developed by the Just-A-Start corporation, through the 100 Percent Affordable Housing Overlay ordinance.
The new funding comes on top of $10.6 million already allocated to the development through the Trust, according to Christopher Cotter, housing director for the Community Development Department.
The AHO, passed by the Council in October 2020, loosens current zoning laws to enable developers to build larger apartment complexes in Cambridge — under the condition that all of the building’s units are affordable and the developers adhere to design guidelines laid out by the ordinance.
The Council will consider housing “affordable” if its rent and utilities do not exceed 30 percent of the occupying household’s income, which must be less than the median household income for the City of Cambridge. The current median income for a four-person household in Cambridge is $120,800.
Although the passage of the AHO met with some opposition from resident groups such as the Cambridge Citizens Coalition, some city residents who had initial reservations about the ordinance were “pleased” with its implementation for the new development, according to Assistant City Manager Iram Farooq.
“Some of those who had been quite skeptical [of the AHO] were actually very pleased with the results of this process, and felt it really was a poster child for the implementation of AHO,” Farooq said in the meeting.
Harvard professor Suzanne Preston Blier, founder of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association and president of the Cambridge Citizens Coalition, said she opposed the AHO because she preferred converting “existing historic structures” to accommodate “smaller, multi-unit” affordable housing.
Blier also expressed concerns that the developments permitted by the AHO would lead to too much density in Cambridge.
“Look at core issues of environmental equity and health equity. When you have so much density, and you remove open spaces and trees, that has a major impact, and I would say the major impact to date of the AHO has been to double the density of the current developments,” Blier said.
James G. Stockard Jr. — former chair of the Cambridge Housing Authority and lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design — emphasized the importance of new developments in addressing the demand for affordable housing in Cambridge, adding that every new affordable unit has “between 10 and 20” applicants.
“It’s a huge problem, and we have to keep fighting to add more stock to the supply of housing for people with modest needs,” Stockard said.
Elizabeth Marsh — a project manager overseeing the New Street development for Just-A-Start — said that although the long timeline for large-scale affordable housing construction can be frustrating, she hopes the project will be “inspirational” for other affordable housing developers.
“I always say that it feels like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the mountain, because the need for affordable housing is so great, and it takes so long to produce it,” Marsh said. “And 100 or so units, as amazing as it is, is just a drop in the bucket in terms of the actual need — there are thousands of people on the waitlists for these projects.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite returning to campus for an in-person semester, some Harvard students attended classes over Zoom last week — a relic of last year’s remote instruction.
Earlier this month, Harvard allowed faculty members to move classes online for the first week of the semester due to the Omicron surge. More than 320 affiliates have tested positive for Covid-19 over the last seven days — a 0.85 percent positivity rate.
Though most students supported the guidance, many opted for the classroom over the Zoom room, citing Zoom fatigue and the advantages of in-person learning.
In addition to attending a General Education course offered solely online, Mina Barac ’25 chose to attend three of her classes in-person following a year of virtual learning.
“My whole senior year I didn’t go to school once,” Barac said. “I’m going back to Zoom now, which is not ideal, but at least most [classes] are offered in-person. So that’s not too bad.”
Charlotte J.P. Hannan ’25 said she prefers attending classes in-person because it helps her stay focused.
“It’s much easier to get distracted if I’m on my computer, either by other tabs or just being in my room and not being in the classroom,” Hannan said. “I can see how it would help some people, but I’m not one of those people.”
Several students praised the physical experience of an in-person classroom as opposed to a virtual Zoom.
“I’m in a STEM concentration, so one thing I’m really happy about is being able to do labs in-person,” Jackson P. Kehoe ’22 said. “That was a big drawback of online classes for sure, just missing out on that lab component.”
Lynne L. Xie ’22, whose classes were entirely in-person, said she prefers the in-person format for her smaller seminar courses.
“I can see how for discussion, it’s much better to facilitate with a lot of words and meanings which come across in body language that you can’t really get from online,” Xie said. “It also just feels more personal.”
Michael D. Wu ’22-’23 said he felt “a little bit of disappointment” upon hearing that his class at the Harvard Business School would run entirely online for the duration of the semester. Still, Wu said he was excited to attend the rest of his in-person classes.
“I like seeing other friends, other people,” Wu added. “It’s just nice to feel like you’re physically in a space, and it feels more like college than just doing a Zoom classroom does.”
Still, some students who attended class virtually said they welcomed the benefits of Zoom school.
Joseph H. Meyer ’25, whose Expository Writing course was held exclusively online, said beginning the year on Zoom helped him “ease into” his second semester.
“It was kind of nice, because you could just get up whenever, go get breakfast, and then bring it back and eat it during the class, and not have to worry a ton,” Meyer said.
Many students said they agreed with Harvard’s decision to let professors decide whether or not to begin classes virtually.
Ethan Taotafa ’23, who attended classes online rather than in person because he was quarantining, said he was a “fan” of the hybrid option.
“Forcing people to go one way or the other — I don’t agree with that,” Taotafa said. “It’s good to have flexibility.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While their home turf was blanketed with snow, the Harvard Men’s Ice Hockey team blanketed their competition on the road this weekend.
The Crimson were sent to New York face off against two conference opponents, the Colgate Raiders, who entered the weekend 3-6-2 in interconference play, and the Cornell Big Red, entering 8-2-0. Harvard itself began 7-4-1.
The weekend’s games continued a stretch of six games in 11 nights for the Crimson, putting a lot of pressure on the team’s depth, and especially its goaltending, as junior goaltender Mitchell Gibson started both halves of the back-to-back set.
“It’s definitely a challenge for us, playing six games in 10 or 11 nights,” head coach Ted Donato said. “But I think we have a lot of confidence in the depth of the team. We don’t just rely on a few players, so I think we were able to make it through pretty well as far as the energy level.”
Despite entering the weekend on a two game losing streak following losses to Clarkson and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Crimson rebounded with a 5-3 against Colgate before earning a 2-2 regulation tie and shootout win against Cornell.
“I don’t think we were in a spot where we were really concerned with how we were playing,” Ted Donato said. “It’s always a tough road trip to go to Colgate and Cornell, and I thought our guys responded really well.”
HARVARD 2, CORNELL 2 (HARVARD WINS IN A SHOOTOUT)
Facing a big test with a road game at No. 8/9 Cornell, Harvard played a strong overall game to earn a regulation tie and shootout win to take five of six possible points from the Big Red this season.
The game began ominously for the Crimson, as a boarding penalty to junior forward John Farinacci just 63 seconds into the game. Cornell forward Brenden Locke converted the man-advantage opportunity just 20 seconds later to put the Big Red ahead 1-0.
Despite conceding the early lead, Harvard carried the play for the rest of the period. Sophomore defenseman Ian Moore had a golden opportunity to tie the game on a shot from the high slot, but the puck rolled just past Cornell goaltender Ian Shane. Farinacci also set up first-year forward Alex Gaffney for a prime chance in front of the net that rolled just past Shane. After a chaotic defensive zone sequence at the tail end of the first period, the Crimson drew a penalty on Cornell’s Justin Ertel to earn a power play chance to carry over to the second frame.
At the start of the second period, Harvard began to capitalize on their strong play. Senior defenseman Marshal Rifai tied the game at 1-1 on the carryover power play with a slap shot rocketing from the faceoff circle, and first-year forward Matthew Coronato put the Crimson in front three minutes later when he corralled the rebound of his own shot just outside the crease.
Despite Harvard controlling play once again for the first half of the second period, Cornell was able to tie the game with nine minutes remaining on a goal by forward Matt Stienburg. From that point forward, Cornell regained some momentum, and began peppering Gibson with chances. The goaltender stood strong, however, and sent the Crimson to the dressing room knotted at 2-2.
“We’ve got a couple freshman defensemen, and they’ve really come into their own,” Gibson said. “Everyone’s been taking care of the little things, little details that we’re paying more and more attention to. Just blocking shots and being selfless.”
Despite the rapid pace of the first two periods, the third period was significantly tighter defensively, with the two teams combining for only 11 shots on goal. Coronato and junior forward and captain Nick Abruzzese each had quality scoring chances but were denied by Shane, sending the game to three-on-three overtime.
Despite outplaying Cornell for significant portions of the game, with Harvard outshooting the Big Red 36-22 for the night, the Crimson was unable to solve Shane during overtime, further extending the game into a shootout. With shootout goals from senior forward and captain Casey Dornbach, sophomore forward Alex Laferriere, and Abruzzese, Harvard prevailed in the shootout after six rounds, with Gibson making the decisive save on Cornell’s Sullivan Mack.
“I think no matter what you want to win,” Gibson said. “There was a lot of excitement during the shootout just to get bragging rights that you came out with a win against a good team like that.”
Donato was similarly thrilled with the outcome considering the rivalry implications between Harvard and Cornell.
“That's a game that's always special to us and to come out and play well and carry the play for most of the night and to ultimately win in the shootout was a great way to end the weekend,” Ted Donato said.
HARVARD 5, COLGATE 3
In the first game of the weekend back to back, the Crimson (9-6-1 overall) were in Clinton, NY on Friday to take on the Colgate Raiders (8-13-2 overall). After a very competitive 60 minutes of ice play, Harvard came out on top 5-3, breaking their two game losing streak.
The first period did not lack in action. Both teams erupted with energy, shift changes jumping out quickly from behind the bench. Within the first four minutes, the Crimson were on the power play, after the Raiders’ first-year forward Alex DiPaolo was sent to the box with hooking. Although Harvard’s power play unit has converted on less than 20% for the season, a clear attempt by Colgate was intercepted by junior defenseman Henry Thrun, who passed to the open sophomore forward Alex Laferriere that found the back of the net on a wrist shot.
Less than a minute later, with the Raiders back to full-strength post power play, the Crimson notched another, extending their lead to 2-0. Junior forward John Farinacci snuck one past Colgate senior goalkeeper Farrier, with Farinacci’s linemates Laferriere and first-year forward Alex Gaffney credited with the assists.
“Although they’ve only played together for a few weeks, I think they’ve looked excellent for us,” said Ted Donato of the Farinacci-Laferriere-Gaffney line, noting that the trio has previous experience playing youth hockey together.
Although down 2-0, the Raiders kept game-play competitive and aggressive, with possession staying quite even. Colgate’s senior forward Josh McKechney executed 7:27 into the period, taking Harvard’s lead down to one.
Repetitive change of possession allowed for fast breaks for both teams. The Crimson were more controlled and consistent, taking time to set up a structured offensive. This would work to their advantage, as first-year defenseman Ian Moore rocketed a slap-shot that found the twine behind Farrier after being deflected in by senior forward Jack Donato with just under eight minutes remaining in the period.
Colgate remained competitive, but so did Harvard. At 13:02 in, first-year forward Matthew Coronato was charged with hooking, causing a power play which his teammates successfully killed. However, the penalty kill unit would fail at their next opportunity, when junior defenseman Ryan Siedam was charged with holding with 3:04 remaining. While the Crimson frantically attempted a clear after junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson lost control of a save, the congestion of the goal area got the best of them, allowing the Raiders’ junior forward Matt Verboon to sneak the puck under Gibson’s glove.
Both teams remained strong in the last two-some minutes of the period.
Harvard started the second of three strong. The Crimson’s second line of Laferriere, Farinacci, and Gaffney took their first shift head on, a shot by Farinacci within the first two minutes of the period barely missed, and the frustration resulted in a confrontation among the teams in front of the net. It was broken up just before gloves dropped, and Colgate’s junior defenseman Liam Watson-Brawn was sent to the box for hitting-from-behind on the play prior.
Harvard failed to convert the power play. Consequently, on the Raiders’ first possession back to full strength, senior forward Griffin Lunn found the back of the net off of his own rebound 4:04 into the period, his maneuver causing Gibson to fall and lose awareness of the puck.
Although gameplay was competitive and both teams had an abundance of fast breaks, Lunn’s score would be the only of the period. Harvard failed to capitalize on two more power plays, while Colgate failed once, after the Crimson’s senior forward Baker Shore was penalized with hooking. The contest continued to be fast and aggressive, but Gibson kept Harvard in the game, stopping ten shots on goal within the period.
The first three-fourths of the last period continued the close competition among the teams. Gibson continued to come up with big saves, and the second line of Laferriere, Farinacci, and Gaffney continued to make big plays.
“Going into the third in a tie game, I was really happy with the way we responded,” Ted Donato said. “It was a much needed win and really a great boost to morale.”
Game play was steady and there was no clear dominance, until Farinacci punched home a backhander off of a Gaffney pass with 4:17 remaining in the game. Harvard continued their momentum, keeping possession in their offensive zone.
They drew an icing call from the Raiders, which led to a faceoff in their offensive zone, to which Crimson senior defenseman Marshall Rifai gained possession, and sent in his second goal of the season, third of his career, and Harvard’s fifth of the game, solidifying their win.
“This stretch of games is really a great learning opportunity, and I think we've come out feeling a lot better about where we are as a team and where we could get to,” Ted Donato said.
The Crimson finished the game with first-year defenseman Jack Bar in the box on a cross-checking call, but were still able to neutralize Colgate’s six man offense, as Farrier was pulled from net.
The Crimson will head across town and look to add to its winning streak in a pre-Boston Beanpot showdown against the Boston College Eagles (10-11-4) this Tuesday at Kelley Rink in Chestnut Hill, MA at 7pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite trailing by as much as 13 points late in the contest, Harvard women’s basketball (10-9, 4-3 Ivy League) completed a furious fourth quarter comeback to notch a 70-63 victory over conference foe Penn (7-11, 2-4). The victory marked the Crimson’s first win at the Quakers’ home venue, The Palestra, since 2012.
Four Crimson players reached double digits in points against Penn, led by junior guard McKenzie Forbes with 18 points. Junior guard Annie Stritzel (12), sophomore guard Lola Mullaney (11), and junior guard Maggie McCarthy (11) were the other points leaders. The two remaining starters, first-year guard Harmoni Turner and senior guard Tess Sussman, each contributed double digit rebounds. Forbes also led the way with 4 assists in the contest.
Penn junior guard Kayla Padilla started the game firing on all cylinders, going on a 9-2 run by herself to give the Quakers an early advantage. The teams then traded several baskets, but Penn remained in control, holding a commanding 13-6 lead. Harvard struggled in the first quarter against the Quakers, shooting 3-for-18 from the floor. However, with one second left in the quarter, Forbes nailed a buzzer beater three-pointer to cut Penn’s lead to four.
“Penn did play pretty good defense,” said Harvard head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith in response to her team’s poor offensive start. “But I think more was due to the fact that we just did not execute very well. We were doing things that were uncharacteristic of us.”
The Quakers continued their hot start in the second quarter, widening its lead to 18-11. Stritzel delivered an offensive spark for the Crimson when, playing the role of super sub, she tallied four points in under a minute. Following a pair of three pointers from Forbes, Harvard trailed only 23-21. However, Harvard’s offensive struggles reemerged as the team was held scoreless for two minutes until Stritzel delivered a three-pointer to end the dry spell. The teams traded more baskets, and Penn ended the first half with a 33-28 lead.
“We like to attack and run,” coach Delaney-Smith said. “But, I felt we were making too many quick, flash, bad decisions on the offensive end of the floor. That’s what I think hurt us in the first half.”
After the break, Penn came out swinging once more, holding the Crimson scoreless for nearly three minutes while tacking on seven points to extend its lead into double digits, 40-28. The lead peaked at the 2:23 mark in the third quarter off of Penn senior guard Mia Lakstigala’s three pointer, which gave Penn a 47-34 advantage. Harvard’s top scorer, Turner, was held scoreless until this point, but with her team in a deep hole late in the contest, the highly touted first-year erupted with back to back field goals. Mullaney added in a three-pointer to end the quarter on a 8-2 run for the Crimson and cut the deficit to 49-42.
Harvard continued its newfound success, embarking on a 15-6 run to begin the final quarter and took its first lead of the game 57-55. Coach Delaney-Smith explained the blueprint for her team’s comeback was her team’s persistent attack in transition, which led to fatigue for the thin-rostered Quakers. Once Harvard took the lead, it never looked back, outscoring Penn 28-14 in the final stanza to reach the final score of 70-63.
“Our philosophy as a staff is to convey confidence and that we believe in [the team],”Coach Delaney-Smith said. “But, truth be told, that is something they did for themselves, and we could see it in their faces and in their eyes. They kept telling each other we’re going to win this game.”
With its sensational comeback victory, Harvard extended its win streak to three games and retained an outright hold on the fourth and final spot in the Ivy League Tournament bracket. The Crimson will return home to host conference rivals Brown and Yale next weekend Feb. 4-5.
