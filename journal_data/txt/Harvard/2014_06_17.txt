After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW DELHI—Air conditioning, for the lucky with air conditioning, is thin paper the heat frays and rips, damping its fibrous edges, wearing it translucent. Fans do less: mix the heat and lob it over in wafts of oven air. The roads feel blistery clean and sweat tarmac, rising shivery with an oozy acrid scent. Bathwater boils from the pipe. I sweat bathing.
My flat mate and I do not yet have a refrigerator, or a water filter, or an air conditioner for my room. We buy drippy liters of water at the shop across the way, and the liquid grows hot as soon as we’re back, the cold flighty as a bird that will not roost on our shoulders. Nimbu paani turns into lemon tea. Black clothes come out warm from the wardrobe. Our own hands betray us, heating our Limca through the glass. It is too hot to eat anything: The sabziye (vegetables) wilt in the kitchen; the green beans cook in the bag. The pendants on my earrings radiate heat, so I put them in a friend’s freezer, forget them there.
This is the weather for drinking beer in the evening in Paharganj, for replacing chai with cold coffee, for eating an ice pop, for tempting a cross breeze, for pressing my sweaty limbs around the sweaty limbs of people I haven’t seen since the bathwater couldn’t warm fast enough and everyone was fat with shawls. At night, the heat is a skinny cat that wraps around and around my thighs, mewing for affection, boring in its need. The heat is the third party in every love affair this summer, the dark horse candidate in all politics, the opening gambit in all dialogues, the dry-lipped stranger in the bed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HARTFORD, Conn.—Just a few hours into my first day at the Hartford Courant, my supervisor told me that I would not be working in the main newsroom. Instead, he had me take a five-minute walk to a cluttered desk tucked away in the attic area of a state building that is ornate and, in many more ways than one, historic.
This summer, I’m writing in the Courant’s Capitol bureau, which is really just a collection of five desks in a fluorescently lit corner of the state Capitol, steps away from the sparkling office building that Connecticut’s lawmakers do much of their business in. Everything about this room—starting with the fact that I sit six feet away from a reporter who is supposed to be my competition but, so far, is closer to being my pal—is different than what I had experienced so far in journalism.
After realizing the odd competitive arrangement, which requires the reporters who work here to alternate between normal and hushed voices (so as not to tip off other outlets on news we might be breaking or angles we might be taking) I see another difference between what I expected and what I am at experiencing. Unlike at The Crimson, where we have just two or three bookshelves scattered throughout the newsroom (and I see news staffers approach those shelves maybe twice a week), everything at the Capitol bureau seems to be done on paper.
My desk is covered in papers that I am told are very important, and that I should not move: I glance at them and see that they are old government releases (Governor John Rowland’s defense papers for his 2004 impeachment hearings are by my right hand), newspapers from last week, last year, and probably even last century, and executive summaries of legislation. In other words, everything on my desk—and almost every sheet of paper in this room—represents something that I am far more accustomed to finding on the Internet.
The paper trail extends, quite literally (though there is a three-foot-wide path cleared for walking) to my boss’s desk. This reporter is a veteran of Connecticut politics, and he’s been at the helm of the Capitol bureau for most of the past 20 years. He is probably the worst culprit of paper dependence—even the other Courant reporters, who in no sense have gone green, make fun of him for this—and he is most fond of collecting phone numbers. On my third day, he brandishes an iPhone 4s, which the Courant has supplied him and other reporters. Noticing that his wall is covered in Post-it notes and his desk adorned with not one, not two, but three Rolodexes, I wonder out loud why he does not simply put the numbers into his phone’s contacts, as I have been trained.
He gives me a little bit of a look. “Well,” he says. “I know which numbers are in here” he gestures the phone “and up here” he points to the wall “and in these” he flips through a Rolodex. My boss continues, explaining that he has so many phone numbers that others frequently call him in order to get a contact. That people call him, he points out, is not at all unhelpful in the quest to break news.
The stacks of paper make the Capitol pressroom resemble a disorganized archive more than anything else. Indeed, anybody expecting a set from “The West Wing” might be disappointed at first glance. But this is exactly what the room should be: I’ve never seen so much paper, and I’ve never been around people who can sort through the stacks so quickly (my boss claims he can find anything in his piles within five minutes). What I think I’m learning is that I’ve got a lot to hoard before I have the phone numbers, legislative missives, and black-and-white printouts—and the relationships these things represent—that my colleagues do. Or maybe I have a lot to Google. I certainly have a lot to write.
But I’m getting better. On my desk are three of the last five editions of the Courant, a paper I still read almost entirely online (though I check each morning to see if I made it into the print edition). In my car is an unpaid parking ticket as well as a form letter one candidate for governor sent to me last week asking me to support him. That letter became a blog post (the guy also asked me for money and said he needs “just a small boost” in fundraising), but I’ll hold on to it for just a little while longer.

MADRID—I put in my two weeks for Madrid before I had even started working.
At first, I was terrified of her. The narrow cobblestone side streets, devoid of life or sound save an old man leaning against a wall smoking a cigarette; the empty bars at noon when the sun was high against a cloudless, salty sky—this was the stuff of nightmares, the places I crept toward, slowly, curiously, but from which I sharply turned away and ran off in the opposite direction.
The nights, which didn’t start until 10:00 or 10:30 p.m., had me convinced that every passerby was a thief, each smile flashed masking some sort of greater evil or intention within. And when a man followed me a few blocks down one of those alleyways in broad daylight, I thought everything was over. I would lock myself in my hostel at nightfall like clockwork, pull the shutters closed, blinds down (at the risk of suffocating in the Spanish heat), grit my teeth through the unbearably long afternoons, and count down each of the 56 days I was to remain in Europe.
One morning early in my first week, I had just finished brushing my teeth and looked in the mirror, into the grey bags under my eyes from the few sleepless nights I had already endured, when I said to myself, “I am not ready for this.” At 18, equipped only with a primitive Spanish pidgin and traveling abroad (and alone), for the first time, maybe I’m not. But since taking my first steps into this dusty, golden, hot country two weeks ago, a few things have changed about my relationship with Madrid.
Maybe it was the growing familiarity of all the streets I crossed in el Centro, like Atocha, or las Huertas, or Mayor. Maybe it was the comfortable lethargy of midday in the city, in which two-course lunches could last for three hours, and the only wakeup call from a food-induced daze came from a sweet cup of café con leche and a broken conversation with a waiter. Whatever did it for me doesn’t matter, really—what matters is that somewhere along the line, I found myself wandering through Madrid at sunrise, a whole night turned on its heels and into my hands, the city’s vices forgiven.
Of course, there were the tapas, the flamenco, the museums, and plazas. But then there were those nights and afternoons and mornings of walking, walking instead of taking the metro, walking to hear the people speak and to map out the city on my own by foot. El Barrio de las Letras, Lavapiés, Malasaña—these became my favorite neighborhoods once I had eaten at enough random tabernas and stumbled upon a few shanty markets and bits of colorful urban art spray-painted onto their buildings. I even grew fond of the street vendors who tried to sell their hats and whistles to tourists in Puerta del Sol, and the two women who hid under rainbow goat costumes and danced around in la Plaza Mayor.
At some point during my stay in Madrid, I began noticing the small corner stores labeled “Alimentación,” or, when translated to English, “feeding.” I never looked hard enough to see if these convenience stores had their own distinct names, or if they were all part of some large chain selling packaged food to Madrileños (though the former is probably correct, and I, just oblivious). The word has since stuck with me. It’s comfortable to carry a new Spanish word into different cities, one whose sound is soft, one that, whenever I pronounce its six distinct syllables, makes me feel a little bit more versed in the language. It’s a word I repeat in my head like a broken record when I have to walk alone in the nighttime, when leering men on the sidewalk click or chatter “ey, mami,” “guapa,” or, even worse, when they match my stride and ask, knowingly, “You are not Spanish, are you?”
And then they’re gone, because I keep walking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 17, 2014 at 5:22 p.m.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary D. Rodham Clinton attracted hundreds of people to the Harvard Book Store on Monday evening for a signing of her new book, “Hard Choices,” which has captured the attention of the national media since its release last week.
Around 1,000 tickets were sold for the event, according to Marcy Harris, marketing coordinating for the bookstore. The entrance queue stretched the lengths of both Plympton street and Linden street between Bow street and Massachusetts avenue. Many of the politician’s supporters, some of whom lacked tickets to the event, lined Massachusetts Ave., often sporting buttons and carrying signs reading, “I’m Ready for Hillary.”
While Clinton, a former U.S. Senator from New York and First Lady, has yet to declared herself as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, her 656-page memoir is oft cited as laying the groundwork for a presidential run.  The high-profile politician came in second in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.
The book discusses her tenure as Secretary of State, including decisions that she made in brokering a cease-fire in Gaza, crafting policy with regard to the Syrian civil war, and shaping her relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, among other topics.
Although Clinton did not speak formally at the book signing, which began about 30 minutes late, she did apologize to the crowd for the delay, citing traffic problems on the Mass. Pike and in Toronto, the most recent stop on her elaborate book tour.
Sofie Karasek, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, who attended the book signing, called Clinton, as a prominent female politician, a role model for aspiring women.
“I wanted to really thank her for being so inspirational to me and so many other young women, especially for being a woman in politics,” said Karasek. “It has been really inspiring to me as someone who is interested in politics to see a woman be at the forefront of so many amazing things and to be such a profound leader in public life. So I thanked her for that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to wrap up a prolific season, a program-best seven members of the Harvard Track and Field team traveled to Eugene, Or. to compete against the best of the nation in the NCAA National Outdoor Championships.
While the competition proved to be as rigorous as advertised, the young team provided a competitive effort while gaining invaluable experience and picking up a few honors in a successful end of the season.
“[The success] is indicative of how far the program has gone and the direction that it’s going,” triple jumper Efe Uwaifo said. “Many of us are [underclassmen]…. It just shows that we’re going to be here, and there are many other in the pipeline who are going to be fighting for spots here.”
The team got started early on Wednesday, with junior Erika Veidis competing in the semifinals of the women’s 800 meters. Veidis clocked in with a time of 2:06.03, placing 16th in the field, just over a second off from qualifying to the finals.
The junior was joined that same day by her fellow female team members as sophomore Autumne Franklin and freshman Jade Miller competed in the women’s 400-meter hurdles.
Franklin placed 10th in the field, while Miller was close by with a 12th place finish, pacing the race with times of 57.48 and 57.91 seconds respectively, just short of the 57.24 second performance which marked the tail end of the qualifying sprinters.
Though none of the runners were able to qualify to their respective final rounds, the top 16 performances from the three athletes were good enough to garner Second Team All-American honors.
In the women’s javelin throw, junior Hannah Mayer looked to successfully cap off a season in which she set both the Harvard and the Ivy League record with a distance of 50.04 meters.
However, the junior would be unable to record a successful throw, instead recording three misses in as many attempts.
Despite the performance, head coach Jason Saretsky believes that the result does not diminish the successful season Mayer had.
“It’s the nature of the [javelin throw], sometimes it doesn’t go your way.” Saretsky said. “[Mayer] has had an outstanding season…. She had an outstanding spring, not only scoring big points for us at the Ivy League Championships, but winning ECAC, breaking the school record and getting to this meet. She has a lot to be proud of.”
Mayer was not the only Crimson athlete to struggle however, as senior James Leakos would be disqualified from the 10-kilometer race despite a solid performance.
While Leakos would have a strong race which saw him finish ahead of many runners and even lap a competitor, he was judged to have left the area of competition during the race, resulting in his race being voided.
While the two performances were disappointing, Harvard would continue a strong showing via sophomore distance runner Tom Purnell.
In a stacked 5-kilometer field that included NCAA Cross Country National Champion Edward Cheserek and runner-up Kennedy Kithuka as well as defending champion Lawi Lalang, the sophomore would clock in at 14:14.07, good for 20th.
The Crimson would finish its performance in the triple jump, where Uwaifo, the only freshman in the field, would land a jump of 15.24 meters to place 24th.
Even though the showing was not what the rookie wanted, Uwaifo believes that the meet was a good way to gain experience and prepare for his trials with the British national team later on this summer.
“It’s definitely an honor to be that guy.” Uwaifo said. “It was good experience to compete against these guys…. It was a wake-up call. I’ve never been in a competition where so many guys are jumping so far. That was definitely a wake-up call but I’ll definitely learn from it, just watching what they were doing.”
While none of the athletes were able to place high enough to qualify for finals in their respective events or achieve First Team All-American honors, the athletes gained valuable experience.
With Leakos as the only senior who qualified, the remaining athletes will return next year with valuable experience under their belt. Saretsky believes that this will be good for the success of both these athletes and other teammates as well.
“It was great to see three of our student athletes get Second Team All-American honors,” Saretsky said. “What’s really exciting is that six of the seven [members] are underclassmen that are back next year so hopefully we can send them and some more of their teammates back to Eugene.”
