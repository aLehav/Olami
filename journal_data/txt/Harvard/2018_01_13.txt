After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just in case 2017 was too light on existential fear, “Black Mirror” handed us one last dose of technology paranoia before the year was over. The long-awaited fourth season of Charlie Brooker’s anthology series hit Netflix on December 29. From helicopter parents to space opera to Tinder, Season Four covered a variety of bases. We break down the season, episode by episode:


USS CallisterEpisode 1, Grace Z. Li
Quite possibly the best episode of Season Four, "USS Callister" reminds us how narratives are meant to be read, reread, revised, and sometimes tossed away in hyperwarp. Read more.


ArkangelEpisode 2, Grace Z. Li
Rather than being a full exploration of the complications of protective instincts and rebellious teenagehood, “Arkangel” comes off as more of a warning label for helicopter parenting. Read more.
CrocodileEpisode 3, Grace Z. Li
“Crocodile” is all gore and shock with no substance. Aside from some dreamy shots of Icelandic scenery, it’s dull watching Mia descend into her linear, murderous path. Read more.


Hang the DJEpisode 4, Caroline A. Tsai
Though the show has garnered a reputation for its handling of dark, controversial subject matter, Season Four dips a toe into somewhat uncharted territory: happy, or at least hopeful, endings. Read more.

MetalheadEpisode 5, Caroline A. Tsai
Despite Peake’s vivid acting, there’s frankly nothing enjoyable about the monotony of survival when the outcome is so transparently futile. Read more.


Black MuseumEpisode 6, Caroline A. Tsai
“Black Museum” is the show at its most self-referential, a throwback kind of fan service. It’s a treat for dedicated viewers of the show, but tends to rely on tried-and-true tropes of episodes past. Read more.

Lauren E. Brandt ‘01 will oversee student life initiatives as Harvard College’s next Associate Dean of Students, administrators announced Friday.
Brandt—who will begin working in her new position on March 5—will have a variety of responsibilities, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates publicizing the appointment Friday. Brandt will help manage housing and residential life, residential tutor training, and campus security, as well as dining services.
Brandt, who has three degrees from Harvard, has served as an assistant dean in the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct since 2014. Before that, she spent six years as the resident dean of Leverett House.
“Dean Brandt’s deep knowledge of Harvard and her established strong partnerships with many College and University offices has allowed her to be incredibly successful in supporting the overall experience of Harvard College students,” O’Dair wrote in the email. “I am thrilled that she will bring her expertise, energy, and approach to the OSL.”
Brandt’s appointment comes more than seven months after her predecessor, David R. Friedrich, announced he was leaving Harvard for MIT. Friedrich, who had served as Associate Dean of Students for over a decade, now oversees housing operations at MIT.
In Oct. 2017, O’Dair wrote that the job posting for Friedrich’s replacement had been “disseminated widely,” and the College had hoped to fill the position by the spring.
“I am very excited about the opportunity to join the OSL team and to work with students, faculty and staff on strengthening their residential communities and experiences at Harvard,” Brandt wrote in an emailed statement Friday.
Brandt will live on campus in Pforzheimer House, according to O’Dair’s email.

UPDATED: January 17, 2018 at 1:52 a.m.
Attorney General Jeff B. Session’s decision to more stringently enforce federal marijuana laws earlier this month renders the future of marijuana businesses in Cambridge hazy, local business owners and legislators say.
Sessions issued guidance to United States attorneys last week opening the door for the prosecution of local commercial and medical marijuana businesses, rescinding an Obama-era policy of avoiding prosecution in states where marijuana is legal. Session’s decision comes roughly a year after Massachusetts gave the drug the green light for recreational use—and just days after the first-ever medical marijuana dispensary opened in Harvard Square.
Nathaniel L. Averill, CEO of the new dispensary, Healthy Pharms Inc., said he feels tentatively optimistic for the future of his business as he monitors the developments surrounding Session’s new memorandum.
“For sure we’re concerned,” he said. “But we also think that the state and the people are behind us.”
In a Jan. 4 memorandum sent to all U.S. attorneys, Sessions called on them to enforce the laws enacted by Congress, which have determined that “marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime.” The memo announced that “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
Marijuana remains an illegal substance under federal law despite its recreational legalization in eight states, including Massachusetts, and legalization for medical use in over 25 states. Andrew E. Lelling, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, told politicians and businessmen in an official statement Monday that he may begin enforcing federal laws more harshly following Session’s new guidance.
“I understand that there are people and groups looking for additional guidance from this office about its approach to enforcing federal laws criminalizing marijuana cultivation and trafficking,” Lelling wrote in the statement. “I cannot, however, provide assurances that certain categories of participants in the state-level marijuana trade will be immune from federal prosecution.”
Jillian Fennimore, director of communications for Mass. Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, wrote in a statement that Healey’s office “ is committed to helping implement legalization effectively and as safely as possible.” Fennimore called on Lelling to make his enforcement priorities clear and to provide guidance to Massachusetts locals, businesses, and municipalities.
According to the Boston Globe, a congressional budget rider currently prevents the use of Department of Justice funding for prosecuting most state-licensed marijuana businesses, but that amendment expires next month and may not be added to the next federal budget.
The new enforcement guidelines have the potential to disrupt a budding industry in Massachusetts. Florida’s Merchant Services Consulting Group, Inc., a payment company that services the majority of medical marijuana dispensaries in the state, pulled out of Massachusetts after Sessions’s comments, forcing many businesses to operate cash-only.
When asked if Healthy Pharms will seek to contact the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, Averill said, “probably not directly.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the Association’s policy of supporting local marijuana businesses has not changed.
“Those of us who were following the issue knew that this was a possibility,” Jillson said. “The voters have spoken, and the city and state issued that it’s a legitimate business within the state of Massachusetts and a legitimate business within the City of Cambridge.”
Jeremy Warnick, a spokesperson for the Cambridge Police Department, wrote in an emailed statement that “we will enforce the rules as they are constituted.”

A top official at the United States Department of Justice likely helped manage the ongoing federal investigation into Harvard’s admissions practices, indicating the probe may be a high priority for the department, according to a D.C.-based civil rights organization.
The civil rights group—the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law—said Friday that internal Justice Department emails show that high-level department administrator John M. Gore partly directed the assignment of attorneys to conduct the department’s investigation into Harvard’s admissions practices. Gore is the acting United States Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.
The lawyers’ committee obtained the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request. In one of those emails, Gore wrote that “We are moving forward with detailing some attorneys to initiate a Title VI investigation of a university’s admissions policy under the front office’s supervision.”
He added that he “reviewed and signed off on” the request for attorneys.
The internal communications only reference “a university” and do not explicitly mention Harvard. The Justice Department, though, has previously said it is investigating Harvard’s admissions policies.
A Department of Justice spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment Friday. The department told the Boston Globe that “The Justice Department is committed to protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-based discrimination.”
Reports of Gore’s involvement come roughly three months after an earlier Justice Department response to the same FOIA request effectively confirmed that the department is investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants to the College.
In Nov. 2017, the Justice Department sent a letter to Harvard’s lawyers threatening legal action if the University did not comply with requests for certain student records. Harvard later offered the department on-site access to the records at the Washington, D.C. office of WilmerHale, the law firm that represents the University.
President Donald Trump appointee John Gore, a Republican lawyer and former partner at Jones Day, has represented clients in recent high-profile cases related to civil rights. He worked with the University of North Carolina in the Obama administration’s “bathroom bill” suit as well as with Republican state governments involved in controversial redistricting efforts.
Jon M. Greenbaum, chief counsel to the Lawyers’ Committee, told the Globe that Gore’s supervision of the Justice Department’s request for attorneys is unusual. He said it means the department has made the probe into Harvard’s admissions “a priority.”
Greenbaum did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement Friday that Harvard is cooperating with the Justice Department probe.
“Harvard has offered the Department of Justice access to the requested documents in a manner that seeks to prevent public disclosure of confidential and highly sensitive student and applicant information entrusted to our protection,” Jackson wrote in the statement. “We believe our position to be in full compliance with our legal obligation under Title VI.”
Harvard is not only facing federal scrutiny—the University is also confronting legal challenges in the form of  an ongoing, roughly three-year-old lawsuit filed by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. The lawsuit alleges that Harvard’s admissions policies are discriminatory against Asian-American applicants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 15, 2017 at 9:28 p.m.
Harvard archaeology professor and scholar Lawrence E. Stager ’65 died Dec. 29 after injuries from a fall in his Concord, Mass. home. He was 74.
Colleagues and family said they will remember Stager as a trailblazer in the field of biblical archaeology and as a warm friend with a genuine personality.
Stager was a graduate of both the College and the Harvard Divinity School; he earned a master's degree and Ph.D.  from the University's Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations department. After temporarily leaving Cambridge to serve as a professor at the University of Chicago, Stager returned to Harvard in 1986 as the inaugural Dorot Professor of the Archaeology of Israel. He founded and led the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon—one of the largest and longest projects in Israel—and also served as director of Harvard’s Semitic Museum.
Though now remembered as a prominent leader in his field, Stager’s path to archaeology was not always clear. He grew up on a rural Ohio farm and was recruited as a first-generation college student by the Harvard Club of Dayton, Ohio.
But Stager nearly failed to complete his freshman year. When he returned home for Thanksgiving his first year at Harvard, Stager told his father he wanted to drop out of school and become a farmer, according to Stager’s daughter, art historian Jennifer M. S. Stager ’00.
Stager's father insisted he continue studying at the College, Jennifer said. Stager obeyed and eventually graduated magna cum laude.
After graduation, Stager briefly contemplated a legal career, according to Jennifer, but changed his mind while excavating in Israel during a postgraduate fellowship. After that dig, Stager realized his passion lay in archaeology and he soon returned to Harvard for his graduate degrees in NELC.
Throughout his career, Stager helped unveil the lives of ancient Canaanites and Philistines, even discovering a Philistine cemetery at one point. His work tackled outstanding questions of ancient world history, focusing on the origins of monotheism and the rise of ancient economies and states in the Near East.
Joseph A. Greene, curator of the Semitic Museum and a former student of Stager’s, called his teacher's approach to archaeology revolutionary. Instead of simply hunting for physical traces of important biblical events and locations, Stager instead worked to build a picture of ancient lives by weaving together material, textual, and scientific evidence, Greene said.
“It was not a matter of taking a text and a shovel and in fact demonstrating that what was written in the bible was the gospel truth,”  Greene said. “It was an attempt to reconstruct ancient society using a full panoply of evidence—the textual, the material, and the scientific.”
Daniel M. Master, co-director of the Leon Levy Expedition and a former graduate student of Stager’s, also said he thinks Stager's work was groundbreaking. Master said he will never forget the time Stager sent him to the basement of the Graduate School of Design to read through the entire collection of the Journal of Garden History.
“What other archaeologist was doing that, trying to pull together these disparate strands?” Master said. “He had these ideas and was able to pull them together into these articles that I use in my classes today, even though they’re 30 years old or 35 years old, because there really wasn’t anything else like them.”
Master added he will also remember how Stager brought together experts from a wide range of fields to contribute to his archaeological digs—whether geologists, botanists, anthropologists, or ceramicists. Master said Stager was one of few archaeologists alive who could "control all of those pieces."
Friends, family, and colleagues said they will never forget Stager's candid and jovial personality. Greene said Stager was always “wickedly funny.”
According to Jennifer, Stager thrived on vigorous debates about topics ranging from archaeological theories to politics to his contempt for organic produce. But no matter how passionate the argument, Stager never stooped to personal attacks, Jennifer said.
“There was a colleague of his with which he vehemently disagreed about various academic matters,” Jennifer said. “I noticed that his bedside table had his most recent book on it, so I think for him the bonds of the academic life were stronger. He was very happy to have those debates. If anything, he was energized by them.”
Once, to illustrate a point on camera, Stager waded out waist-deep into a pool of water at an excavation site in Carthage, Tunisia, Greene said. Stager ended up proving his point: He demonstrated that an ancient landlocked harbor had sunk over time.
“He was the same in the field and out of the field, he was the same in the classroom and at a party,” Adam J. Aja, an assistant curator at the Semitic Museum and a former student and expedition coworker, said. “People have different masks that they put on for their different audiences. He was just Larry.”
Aja said she will always remember Stager’s distinctive catchphrases.
“We would always end up imitating him,” Aja said. “He captured the room when he was in it and swept the rest of us up at that time with him.”
Stager is survived by his two children, Jennifer and David Stager, and four grandchildren.
“He had a really adventurous and exciting life and it was really a life of his own crafting,” Jennifer said. “He was really a proponent of finding the thing that you loved and continuing to do it with all of your effort.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 15, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote to Jennifer Stager. In fact, Joseph A. Greene said Lawrence E. Stager '65 was "wickedly funny."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a gritty matchup, the women’s ice hockey team fell to No. 4/4 Colgate 3-2 at Class of 1965 arena in Hamilton, N.Y. The match added another win to the Raiders now-three game win streak and handed Harvard its second straight loss.
“I would say tonight was probably our best full game of Harvard hockey,” sophomore goalie Beth Larcom said. “We’ve really been stressing playing a full 60 minutes, and I think that’s what we got tonight in terms of holding our own. Obviously, they’re a quick, fast opponent with some good talent, but we definitely held our own and showed that we belong up there with the best teams.”
While the two teams remained scoreless for half of the first period, it was Harvard (8-6-1, 6-4-1 ECAC) sophomore forward Kat Hughes lit up the lamp off of a loose puck in the crease with the assist coming from freshman forward Becca Gilmore. Hughes’ goal added to her season total of eight, which leads the team.
“We broke it out, and Becca Gilmore and Bradley Fusco were on a two on one, and I was right behind the play,” Hughes said. “There was a loose puck in front of the net. I took a shot, and I took another shot, and it went in. The goalie didn’t really see it, so that was pretty lucky.”
Colgate (18-3-1, 9-2-0)  would respond a few moments later when freshman forward Malia Schneider slid a shot past Larcom for her 11th goal of the season. Schneider cleaned up a rebound off a shot from senior forward Shelby Perry, who got the assist on the play.
Perry would score a goal of her own two minutes into the second period on a breakaway. However, later in the period Harvard countered with a score from freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich, who redirected a shot from Gilmore. Gilmore’s second assist gave her her fifth multipoint game of the season, a team high.
The Crimson brought immense energy to third period, outshooting the Raiders 15-4 in the frame. However, Colgate would edge ahead four minutes into the period after senior defenseman Lauren Wildfang wristed a shot past Larcom off a pass from Schneider, handing Schneider her 15th assist on the season and three points for the game. The goal would prove enough as Colgate came away with the 3-2 victory. Earlier in the period, Jovanovich almost added her second goal of the game, but was ultimately denied by Raiders goalkeeper junior Julia Vandyk.
The powerplay was ineffective for both teams. The Crimson was unable to convert on seven attempts, while Colgate failed to capitalize on four of its own. The effectiveness of both teams’ goalkeepers may have contributed. Larcom accumulated a career-high 35 saves and Vandyk saved 25 shots of her own.
“I pretty much approach every game the same way,” Larcom said. “You can’t really take any opponent lightly, but granted, I knew going into it that I was probably going to see a lot of shots; it happened a lot last year in the Colgate game as well, but just getting out there and battling for every puck, and at the end of the day having fun, doing the job I’m there to do.”
Harvard returns to the rink tomorrow against Cornell in Ithaca, New York on Saturday and will face a couple of tough games in the upcoming schedule, including a matchup against ECAC top-ranked Clarkson.
“Our next three games are against all top-10 teams, and so was our game tonight, and I think that’s really good preparation at this point in the season,” Hughes said. “After playing Colgate today, who was fourth, we have an understanding for the pace and what we need to do in terms of hanging with the other team and how physical we need to play. That was huge going into our game against Cornell, who is sixth, which will be another hard, physical game for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early December, the Harvard men’s hockey team traveled to Princeton and Quinnipiac looking to right the ship after a disappointing stretch of games the month prior. That weekend proved to be a success, as the Crimson returned to Cambridge with four points from two decisive victories.
This weekend, the team once again squared off against these ECAC foes, only as the home team this time. And while Harvard (8-6-3, 7-3-2 ECAC) entered the weekend on better footing than it did back in December—the squad has not suffered a loss in 2018—the conference points on the line were just as crucial to the Crimson’s season.
“Moving forward, games only get harder as teams start to realize where they’re falling in the standings,” said tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen. “We need to get wins where we can…. With the Beanpot games, the way they line up we usually have some weekends where we have one game, and it’s easy for teams to leapfrog us in those situations.”
Of the four points available, Harvard claimed three in a victory over the Tigers (6-10-3, 3-8-1) on Friday followed by a draw with the Bobcats (8-12-3, 4-7-2) the following afternoon.
HARVARD 2, QUINNIPIAC 2 (OT)
Special teams almost stole the show in Saturday’s afternoon matchup between the Crimson and the Bobcats, but the tilt ended in a tie after junior forward Ryan Donato notched the game late. Five minutes of overtime proved unhelpful in deciding a victor.
With just three and a half minutes remaining, sophomore blue-liner John Marino intercepted the puck deep in the Quinnipiac zone and shoved it toward the cage. While commotion ensued around the blue paint, the puck popped out to the left of Bobcats net-minder Keith Petruzzelli, where a falling Donato punched in the equalizer.
“I saw some bodies fly,” Madsen recounted “Then I see the puck pop out to Ryan and the goalie trying to get across…. I saw him get it, and I’m like, ‘that’s got to be it,’ and he sure enough put it in. Everyone was ecstatic.”
Despite the unexciting nature of a draw, Harvard’s third overtime game in its last four contests ended in dramatic fashion, as Donato—unsurprisingly—was in prime position to score the game-winner with just five seconds on the clock.
Instead of firing a quick shot through traffic, the Boston Bruins prospect elected to deke around Petruzzelli. By the time Donato looked to score, a defender had closed on him and he was forced to take the puck behind the net, where time expired.
“It would have obviously been a really cool moment again, had we pulled it off,” Madsen said. “But I was happy that we were able to battle back…and pick up some points.”
Had Donato scored, the Crimson would have yet again stolen an overtime game in the waning seconds. Last Saturday, freshman forward Henry Bowlby buried Union with 5.1 seconds remaining in the extra frame.
“I love the fact that our guys play until the final buzzer,” coach Donato said. “I think there were a lot of good things, even though looking back, we feel like the first period wasn’t our best and put us in a spot where we were chasing more than we would’ve liked early on.”
Prior to Harvard’s equalizer, the man-advantage helped the Bobcats build a one-goal lead. In the first period, senior forward Bo Pieper drew first blood on the power play with his sixth tally of the season and his third in the last five contests.
Later, at the tail end of the second frame, Quinnipiac struck again with the extra man, this time coming from the stick of captain and defenseman Chase Priskie. Posted up at the right circle, Priskie received a wheelhouse feed from freshman forward Odeen Tufto and rocketed a one-timer over Madsen’s right shoulder. The Washington Capitals draft pick recorded a two-point night, as he picked up an apple on the Pieper goal as well.
Unlike the opposition, the Crimson’s power play was unsuccessful in Saturday’s matinee, failing to convert on any of its three opportunities with the man-advantage. Man-up struggles have been a negative trend in Harvard’s play of late, despite the squad’s lossless 2018.
“Sometimes you get some bounces and sometimes you don’t,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said, somewhat optimistically of his power play. “Tonight, we had at least two times…that the puck was rolling, where it looked like it was going in, and somehow stayed out of the net. But I thought we were moving the puck and getting the type of looks and the type of opportunities that we’re trying to get.”
Since the new year, Harvard has executed on just one of its 17 power play attempts (7.1% effective), good for fifth-worst in the country over that span. Only five programs entered Saturday’s tilt with a worse mark in 2018, with the Bobcats being one of them. Needless to say, Quinnipiac broke out of its power play slump in the draw with the Crimson.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 1
Despite a physical game that saw 13 infractions whistled against the two teams, it was ultimately not the man advantage that tipped the scale for the Crimson in its Friday night victory over the Tigers.
Sustained offensive effort had Harvard leading, 1-0, early in the second period. With the Crimson on the power play, Princeton senior forward David Hallisey found the puck on his stick and charged down the ice on a breakaway. Hallisey deked around Madsen and got a shot off, but the senior net-minder, stretched out as far as his six-foot-five frame would allow, flashed the leather and snatched up a certain goal.
The fans couldn’t believe their eyes—and neither could the referees, apparently, as the play was reviewed to confirm the save. Madsen’s acrobatics secured momentum for the Harvard icemen, who held onto their lead for the rest of the night.
“The breakaway save he made in the second was an amazing save,” coach Donato applauded. “Ryan Donato was in the slot about to shoot, and his stick broke. And a guy that had been injured for them had changed, so that’s what led to them getting a guy behind us…. They got a breakaway on it, and it really could’ve changed the feeling of the game, but Merrick just did not quit on the play.”
Madsen’s numbers show that he was once again confident between the pipes, making 35 of 36 saves (.972 SV%) and posting a shutout through the first 40 minutes.
“I thought Merrick was outstanding, especially in the first and second periods,” coach Donato said. “[He] gave our team a great amount of confidence, the way he was playing.”
The Arizona Coyotes prospect was not the only player to have a major impact on Friday night’s tilt. Donato bounced back from his first scoreless performance of the season last Tuesday with a two-goal effort against the Tigers.
The Scituate, Mass., native opened the scoring with half a minute to play in the first frame, picking up a rebound from sophomore forward Ty Pelton-Byce in the slot and shooting clear over the shoulder of freshman backstop Ryan Ferland. Though the Crimson left the ice after 20 with just a one-goal lead, the team outshot Princeton 18-6 in the first period.
“Something that we’re trying to work on is having better starts,” Madsen said. “We want to have every line get out there in the first five minutes or so…. Getting off to a good start like that helps continue through the period and through the game. You don’t want to be chasing a game.”
The home team’s offensive push continued into the second frame, when freshman forward Jack Badini skated around the Tigers’ defense shorthanded and beat Ferland glove-side, extending Harvard’s lead to 2-0. Later in the period, Donato found twine once again with a snipe to the far corner.
On Friday night, Harvard’s goal-scorers added to their impressive point totals—Donato scored his team-leading 16th goal in as many games, while Badini passed the double-digit points threshold with his game-winning snipe.
After potting the game-tying puck on Saturday, Donato has remained on a goal-per-game pace and leads the nation in that regard. In addition to his pair of tallies, the recently announced Olympian had 10 of the Crimson’s 42 total shots on goal on Friday.
“I was really happy with the urgency,” Madsen said, praising the offense. “The one thing that we’ve had a ton of this year is effort…. I think it showed Friday night—the first two periods especially.”
Coach Donato likewise appreciated the offensive push to start the tilt.
“I thought we came out and took the play to them in the first couple periods,” the bench boss said. “We were able to establish some offensive zone time and have some great opportunities. Our power play didn’t score but created a lot of momentum.”
Pelton-Byce had a good showing too, picking up two assists. The sophomore’s effort earned him a line promotion the following night and a chance to play alongside Donato, the finisher of his two helpers on Friday.
Pelton-Byce’s roster mobility was made possible by the continued absence of freshman Henry Bowlby, Donato’s usual left-winger, due to illness—an ailment that could sideline the rookie for a few weeks.
Princeton eventually generated some offense of its own and foiled Madsen’s plans for a shutout. A little over a minute into the third, the Tigers struck gold on the power play. Sophomore Jackson Cressey collected a cross-ice pass and beat the otherwise perfect Harvard tender.
Despite Cressey’s man-up score, the Crimson successfully killed off Princeton’s five other power play opportunities on Friday night. The team’s recent success on the kill brought Harvard’s man-down efficiency into the top 10 nationwide—that is, until the Crimson conceded two power play strikes to the Bobcats in Saturday’s matinee.
