After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some cootie-phobic students’ wishes are coming true: Many public schools are reverting to single-sex classrooms where boys and girls are segregated. Supporters of the 445 such classrooms nationwide insist that separating the two sexes will allow students to learn better. For the most part, they claim that females will be more likely to speak up in a classroom where there are no males and that males will focus more on learning and less on showing off to the girls by causing trouble. In general, we are in favor of innovative education methods. Yet reverting to single-sex education is an ineffective and potentially harmful experiment that simply should not be conducted.
One major goal of education is to ensure that students are sufficiently prepared for the world outside the confines of their schools. Segregating girls from boys means that students of opposite sexes are deprived of the opportunity to collaborate on projects, feed off each other’s ideas, and learn from each other. Critics of single-sex education worry that boys who are never forced to work on tasks with girls will have problems later in life working under a female boss or alongside female coworkers. This concern is certainly valid, and the effect cuts both ways: Being perpetually separated from boys may cause females to have qualms about standing up to male coworkers or supervisors. In order to be prepared for the working world, students must grow up without feelings of intimidation or inferiority about members of the opposite sex—this can only be accomplished when students learn together. 
Research has shown that many of the studies showing the benefits of single-sex education are flawed: Benefits incurred in such environments are generally due to other aspects of the schools in which such experiments are carried out, such as the small classrooms or more affluent students that are only possible at single-sex private schools. Therefore, many of the supposed benefits of single-sex education are not actually due to the segregation of boys from girls. 
There are many ways—other than segregating the sexes—to improve our schools so that girls are less intimidated in the classroom and boys are less likely to be a distraction. Smaller class sizes would mean that teachers would notice girls who are hesitant to participate and be more likely to discipline boys appropriately. Providing incentives for teachers will also, on the whole, improve their teaching and thus their students’ performances. 
There is a reason that this country has, on the whole, moved away from single-sex education. While teaching boys and girls separately may solve a few minor disciplinary issues, it does not have enough benefits to justify its enormous disadvantage: Members of the two sexes never learn to work together in an educational environment. Moreover, segregation can be unfair; catering to different needs among the sexes very well means that there may be discrepancies in what the students learn. 
With the educational gap between boys and girls closing, it is precisely the wrong time to revert back to single-sex education. Girls are finally becoming more comfortable in a mixed-gender classroom, and it is high time to fully break the vicious cycle of discomfort in a coeducational environment. 
In 1943, Radcliffe women were finally allowed to learn in the same classrooms as Harvard men—now is not the time to revert back to pre-WWII conceptions of how to educate. All students should be able to graduate from elementary and secondary school having experienced mixed-sex education and ready for the world they will face.

As usual, the gender police have arrived on the scene with much aplomb but with little information. The criticism that several public schools—especially in New York City—have elicited over the past year for their decision to separate middle-school classrooms by gender is based on a body of unfounded assumptions, and, if anything, these schools should be praised for creating an educational environment that will enable early adolescents to learn with as few unnecessary distractions as possible.
While it is true that arbitrary segregation based on gender is inappropriate and unjustified, the facts of this particular educational initiative are more nuanced. While these schools do separate boys and girls, it is unfair to say that they “segregate” students, for any student wishing to learn in a coeducational setting always has the option to opt out of the program. Also, it should be noted that such separation exists only in middle-school classrooms and, for that matter, only in certain subjects. The schools themselves are not separated, and students are still afforded normal social interaction with peers of the opposite sex. The subject material that male and female students cover in their respective courses is identical; the only difference is that single-sex classrooms present that material in a more palatable way for students entering the awkwardness of puberty. Considering these facts, applying what is in this case the irrelevant “separate is unequal” maxim to this particular method of single-sex education diminishes both the cause of gender equality and the potential benefits of this new approach to education. 
In other words, this new method is not a return to the sexual stereotyping of the 1950s or in any way a veiled attempt at recreating the “pink ghetto” of generations past; this is merely an attempt at ensuring that boys and girls learn as productively and as efficiently as they can during the brief period in which they acquaint themselves with their changing bodies and changing selves. For the first time ever, formerly sexless children are suddenly curious about members of the opposite sex, and such curiosity is confusing, disorienting, and distracting, at least for the first year or so. In a classroom setting, it goes without saying that young people of this age are preoccupied with other things besides algebra or sentence diagramming. If students spend these awkward years in single-sex rather than coeducational classrooms, the majority of those distractions are instantly eliminated. They can learn and focus in a comfortable environment in which they need not worry about the way they appear to members of the opposite sex. By surrounding students with others undergoing the same bizarre transformation, single-sex classrooms provide an atmosphere as conducive to self-exploration and self-understanding as to undistracted learning, an essential component to gender relations of any kind.
Those who unfortunately argue against this program claim that these few years spent apart might hinder a boy’s ability to relate to a girl, and vice versa, once he or she reaches “the real world.” But it must be understood that schools alone are incapable of determining gender relations. When schools segregated men and women before, such segregation was not the reason that men were allowed to feel superior to women or that women were taught to feel inferior to men. The sexism of the past stemmed from innumerable sources within society as a whole, and the schools “back then” did not create the awful sexual stereotypes; they merely reinforced them. And, since we no longer live in a society that promotes blatant sexism, we cannot therefore assume that single-sex classrooms—especially for periods as brief as a few years—could revive the disparate nature of gender relations that for so long defined this country. 
What is perhaps most unsettling, though, is that this program’s detractors are discouraging educational experimentation in a time we need it the most. It is unfortunate that the unnecessary desire to be politically correct at any expense interferes with a commitment to the prospect of improvement.

Yet again, conservatives are waging an ideological battle because they are unable to offer new ideas. In a recent Washington Post column, noted conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer argues that President Obama is using the financial crisis to force through a liberal agenda under the guise of economic recovery. “Obama sees the continuing financial crisis as usefully creating the psychological conditions—the sense of crisis bordering on fear—itself panic—for enacting his ‘Big Bang’ agenda to federalize and/or socialize health care, education and energy, the commanding heights of post-industrial society,” he writes.
What Krauthammer and other conservative commentators do not recognize is the extent to which health care, education, and energy actually affect the economy. Democrats are not the only ones who go to the hospital, attend college, or buy gas; these expenses affect liberals, conservatives, and independents alike. Given the long-standing weaknesses of our economy, Obama’s supposedly “liberal” proposal presents the most viable fix for the problems currently afflicting all Americans. 
Krauthammer claims that Obama’s plan to reduce health-care costs, make college more affordable, develop alternative sources of energy, and limit greenhouse- gas emissions is “perhaps the greatest non sequitur ever foisted upon the American people.” (In a non sequitur of my own, I wish that Krauthammer had been so sensitive to non sequiturs during the Bush administration, when a terrorist attack by Saudi nationals became justification for a war in Iraq.) While Krauthammer is right that “at the very center of our economic near-depression is a credit bubble, a housing collapse and a systemic failure of the banking industry,” he refuses to acknowledge that long-term economic recovery will need to address not only the most immediate causes of the financial crisis, but also structural and long-persisting challenges to economic growth. 
These challenges are just as Obama defines them: the soaring health-care costs that disadvantage American companies abroad, the difficulty young people—the lifeblood of any economy—have affording higher education, and, most drastically, the threat that a failure to meaningfully combat global warming will pose to both the planet and human lives. As Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote for Politico in response to Krauthammer’s piece, Obama is “not only a brilliant strategist, he is a brilliant analyst of America, understanding all the factors that contribute to economic decline and recovery.” 
It is Krauthammer’s belief that Obama should respond to the financial meltdown only so far as to rehabilitate the stock market, restore bank balance sheets, and return to the status quo of increasing income inequality once credit begins to flow again. But Obama is smarter than to think that the problems in the economy begin and end with a housing bubble or reckless banking practices. If the economy is not restructured, health care—even in a bull market—will remain unaffordable for most American businesses and families; paying for college—even in a bull market—will remain a formidable challenge for most young adults; and business practices that contribute to global warming—even in a bull market—will persist unchallenged by federal policies. In other words, Krauthammer and the conservatives offer eight years of the Bush administration all over again, whereas Obama offers the change Americans voted for.

Perhaps it was inevitable that, with the ascendance of a powerful new Democratic majority in Congress, the putrid carcass of the so-called “Fairness Doctrine” would rise again. This policy, originally established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, mandated that the federal government enforce a balance of political viewpoints expressed via the medium of radio broadcast. For nearly four decades, this flagrant violation of the First Amendment was the law of the land; it was finally repealed during the Reagan years. Since then, the left has made intermittent attempts to revive the doctrine, but—thankfully—it has not yet succeeded.
Recently, however, an emboldened tide of Democratic partisans, including former President Bill Clinton, Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, and Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow, have once more called for the doctrine’s resurrection. President Obama and the Senate, on the other hand, have wisely come out against re-imposing this “balance” to the airwaves.
Aside from the political history involved, there is a good reason that the doctrine has never been reinstated. For a policy that trumpets its supposed objectivity, it has drawn conspicuously little bipartisan support. Few Republicans ever have or ever will come out in favor of the doctrine, for it has a highly partisan objective—the muzzling of conservative talk radio.
Some promoters of this folly claim that their stake in its reinstatement consists of the elevation of our public discourse by giving both sides of any issue a fair trial in the public square. This is indeed a noble pursuit. Certain hypocrisies, however, expose the true motives of the doctrine’s supporters.
For starters, the only medium that they ever wish to see put under the yoke of the doctrine’s jurisdiction is talk radio. This singling out of a particular form of media seems arbitrary, but it takes little time or effort to discover what makes radio different from print, television, and the Internet: its domination by the right wing. Indeed, one never sees liberals calling for the Fairness Doctrine to be applied to the opinion page of the New York Times, MSNBC, or the blogosphere; the dearth of right-wing commentary in these outlets is not a mere coincidence. Moreover, one cannot even claim that the justification for this selectivity is the distinction between editorial and news content, for the reactionary bloviators of talk radio make no bones about their political opinions.
Now, some liberals will openly admit that they wish to curb conservatives’ supremacy on the airwaves, insisting that the right has an unfair structural advantage. Liberal radio host Bill Press is one of these, as he demonstrated in an interview with Senator Tom Harkin: “You know, we’re not going to take any of the conservative voices off the airwaves, but just make sure that there are a few progressives and liberals out there, right?” Press correctly points out that the doctrine does not entail censorship, but government meddling in broadcasting content for reasons other than slander or obscenity is still unconstitutional. Press’s premise, moreover, is farcical: Talk radio operates under the rules of the free market system. There is no structural advantage for conservatives; they just happen to flourish in this realm. Nothing is hindering liberals from talk radio success other than their lack of appeal to talk-radio’s conservative-leaning audience, just as conservatives struggle to prosper in the liberal dominions of print media, the Internet, and late-night television comedy. 
But even if one were to take Doctrinaires at their word and assume that they solely desire the elevation of public discourse, and even if one were to ignore the unconstitutionality of the means to this end, a critical flaw still lingers. If the FCC is given the authority to dictate what constitutes “balanced” coverage of the issues, then the FCC is given dominion over the definition of “balanced.” There are far more than only two sides to every debate, and yet the assumption goes that the FCC would only stipulate that conventional liberal and conventional conservative paradigms be represented. 
The doctrine’s opacity grants the FCC enormous powers, as it will be able to dictate which viewpoints are legitimate enough for coverage, which would lead to one of two outcomes. Either the FCC would grant every viewpoint equal time, which clearly defies practicality, or it would grant only a handful of viewpoints equal time, which clearly defies “fairness.”
Opposing the Fairness Doctrine does not make one an apologist for the rotund regent of the right wing, Rush Limbaugh. The real issue here is the violation of free speech entailed by such regulation of opinion. No matter the objectives of its well-intentioned supporters, the chilling effects of the Fairness Doctrine are clear and unambiguous.

A week ago, Obama announced that he would lift President George W. Bush’s ban on stem cell research. The announcement set the chattering classes aflame. House minority leader John Boehner accused Obama of “further dividing our nation at a time when we need greater unity.” A senior U.S. cardinal called it a “sad victory of politics over science and ethics.” Others, many of whom support stem cell research, responded with particular fervor to Obama’s claim that he was putting science before politics. The Washington Post’s Charles Krauthammer called the address an “outrage” and “morally unserious in the extreme.”
While Obama’s speech was a momentous one, concerned citizens on both sides of the ideological divide should be wary of attaching too much importance to Obama’s decision. The policy shift is simply a matter of degree. Under Bush, funding for research on embryonic stem cells was not prohibited but just limited to the lines already in existence. Though federal money could not flow to new embryonic stem cell research clinics, eight states (and big ones, too, like New York and California) funded their own labs and allowed private funding. While the opening of federal funds to stem cells will lead to an expansion of research facilities, scientists will likely still only be permitted to use embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. The fact that Obama declined to state solid ethics guidelines does not mean that the scientists at National Institute of Health will allow researchers to create embryos at will to harvest at their pleasure.
Much of the indignation on online message boards points to the efficacy of adult stem cells as an alternative to embryonic stem cells, with some even supporting the outlandish argument that stem cell advocates must be somehow connected to the abortion industry. Much of this reflects confusion over how adult stem cells work. Stem cell therapies focus on regrowing parts of the body, but adult stem cells are less versatile than embryonic stem cells since they can typically only grow into cell types found in the tissue where they originated. Many scientists hope that adult stem cells may be coaxed into transforming into a wider range of cell types, but as of now the cells are not well understood.
It’s also important to note that the majority of Americans support expanding stem cell research. A recent Gallup poll found that only four in 10 Americans support further restrictions. Claims that Obama is pursuing the pet causes of liberal scientists against the wishes of most Americans are simply incorrect.
However, the pro-stem cell contingent is also guilty of overblown rhetoric, not only for labeling the decision as a godsend but also for being too cavalier about procedures with legitimate ethical concerns. Stem cell advocates often make their case on the research’s life-saving potential, stressing the merit of destroying a five-day-old embryo to save a five-year-old girl. But this is an unfair comparison. Yes, the number of available stem cell lines will hopefully reach somewhere in the hundreds, but it will be 120 days before the NIH will even come up with new research guidelines, much less start doling out grants to scientists. Life-saving therapy derived from stem cell research is still many years in the future, and remedies for that girl may not be developed until she is old enough to have five-year-olds of her own.
Furthermore, the pro-research camp often goes too far in disregarding the significance of embryos as the origins of human life. A recent Crimson editorial (“Cell-ebration,” March 10) used highly misleading language in calling embryos “merely a collection of cells.” Embryos are a far cry from a toddler, but we should exercise caution about starting down the path toward sacrificing human life simply to harvest components for experiments.
However, far more important than the stem cell decision was Obama’s memorandum to ensure openness about science and protect scientists, released at the same time. This marks a far greater departure from the Bush administration and cuts to the heart of the debate on many issues, such as conservation and global warming, in discounting the “false choice between science and moral values.” As I pointed out in an earlier column, the Bush administration was often directly antagonistic to concerns of scientists, allegedly editing releases about global warming, silencing a top climatologist through NASA, and pressuring the surgeon general not to discuss the dangers of secondhand smoke.
Obama’s memo will encourage the spirit of free debate and may help lead to the greater dissemination of apolitical findings. But, more importantly, it promises that policymakers will accept and grapple with scientific evidence, not ignore or censor it when it clashes with the president’s policies. Obama has already made good on this promise by issuing a memorandum that will restore a provision of the Endangered Species Act that requires federal agencies to consult the Fish and Wildlife Service before taking action on endangered species. Hopefully, the stem cell decision will be seen not as the end of morality in science policy, but as the beginning of an era where science is again taken seriously by the federal government.

Harvard freshman Jeff Cohen led the No. 16 Crimson lacrosse team’s offensive charge against Hartford University’s Hawks (0-4) this past Friday night at home on Cumnock Turf. The Crimson (3-1) overwhelmed its non-conference opponent, 18-7.
Cohen netted five of Harvard’s 18 goals, setting a new career-high for goals in a game and revitalizing the Crimson’s attack that had been missing in its last outing against University of Massachusetts only a week before. 
“It was obviously a disappointing week last week,” Crimson coach John Tillman said of last week’s loss. “And, we were really challenged to bounce back; to try to respond. We started out really strongly [against Hartford.] So that’s a big credit to our guys.”

The Crimson win saw great performances from junior Jesse Fehr, who had a hat trick, classmate Travis Burr, who collected a career-best four goals, and Cohen, who recorded a career-high five tallies. But the 18-7 win was a real testament to the Crimson’s willingness to play as a team.
“We really moved the ball well,” said Cohen. “Almost all of my goals were assisted, and we played the way we knew we could play.”
Most of the games action was on Hartford’s end of the field. But, despite not facing a huge offensive threat, Harvard’s defense also delivered a solid performance on the night. Senior goalie Joe Pike made five saves in nearly 55 minutes of action, and the Crimson defense held the Hawks scoreless on three man-up opportunities throughout the game. 
“Because we possessed the ball so much on offense, there were times when we played on our heels,” said Coach Tillman. “We are best when we are really aggressive. So we will really emphasize getting back to basics [in this next week of practice].”
Harvard jumped to an early advantage over the Hawks, scoring three goals within the first five minutes of the game. Burr opened the game with a goal at 11:41. Receiving a pass from freshman Kevin Vaughan behind the net, Burr buried the shot from a front-on look at the goal.
Burr’s goal was quickly followed by a goal from senior co-captain Nick Smith and another by freshman Terry White. White fired a side-arm shot from 20 yards out past the Hartford goalie, increasing the Crimson’s lead. 
Junior Jason Duboe, Burr and Cohen added on to the lead in the latter half of the first, giving Harvard a 6-0 advantage by the end of the first period.
In the second period, the Hawks began to chip away at the Crimson’s lead, but the Crimson carried on its offensive momentum from the first quarter, soon crippling the hopes of a Hartford comeback.
Just over mid-way through the period, Vaughan caught a fast break off of a Hartford turnover, sending the ball to senior Jeff Wannop, who fired it into the lower left corner of the net. Shortly thereafter, Duboe launched another rocket for a goal, followed by a Burr tally. Harvard entered halftime ahead 9-3.
Hartford grabbed two quick goals within an eight-second window early in the second half of the game, but the Crimson answered with an 8-0 run, led by junior Jesse Fehr, Burr and Cohen. 
Fehr sparked Harvard’s scoring spree, finding the net off a pass from Cohen at 8:41 in the third period. A couple of minutes later, Fehr assisted Burr, who put in his fourth goal of the game. Cohen then added his third and fourth tallies before Fehr closed out the period with another score at 1:29.
In the beginning of the fourth period, senior co-captain Max Motschwiller found the back of the net and was the eighth Crimson player to score on the day, highlighting what was a real team effort.
“I think we shared the ball and moved the ball much faster,” Coach Tillman said of his offense. “We made better choices. We were much more unselfish. And, we stuck our shots.”
Cohen and Fehr capped off the scoring streak for Harvard in the final period, each player finding the back of the net one more time before the end of the game.

Around the Ivy League track and field circuit, Becky Christensen has been a household name for a while now. For the second straight year, it appears that the entire country has taken notice of the Harvard co-captain as well.This weekend, Christensen returned to her home state of Texas to compete in the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships for the second year in a row. In a high jump event that featured some of the best athletes in the country, the standout Crimson athlete finished fifth overall and garnered back-to-back All-American Indoor honors after clearing a 1.83-meter bar on Friday night.“I’m kind of disappointed with how I did, just because I know that I can jump higher,” Christensen said. “Overall, I’m happy with how I still ended up placing well, but I wish I could have done better.”“She was ranked third in the country going in, so you never like to say that you expect a top-five performance, but as a coaching staff we’ve been a bit spoiled with Becky,” coach Jason Saretsky said.  The lone Harvard representative also cleared the bar at 1.83 meters her junior year. And while that was good enough for a fourth place finish, a 1.83 clearing this year would only garner fifth place in a more competitive field. Texas junior Destinee Hooker won the event with a record-setting clearance of 1.98 meters.Always aiming for further heights, Christensen improved substantially over the course of this year’s indoor season. With the help of her coaches, Christensen worked on improving her approach to the bar. “I’ve always had slow approach,” Christensen said. “My coach and I have been working on running faster the whole time. If I can get a good plant, then I really get into the air well.”“She’s a very technical sound jumper,” Saretsky said. “We wanted to give her more speed on her approach…Overall, she’s taken a big step forward.”While Christensen easily handled her fellow Ivy League competitors this season, the athlete known for her work ethic and motivation continued to work on jumping even higher above the rest of the field.Christensen’s new personal-best of 1.91 meters set last month beat her previous mark by seven inches. This not only moved her into second all-time in the Harvard record books, but also guaranteed her a berth in the NCAAs, a coveted spot that hasn’t always been easy for Christensen to get.  “My freshman and sophomore year, I was one or two centimeters away both years, so last year, to even finally make it into the meet was such a great thing,” Christensen said. “To actually come out of it ranked fourth after being ranked last going in was great.”But Christensen was not at her best this weekend.“Some days it’s really on and I jump really well, and some days it’s just not on, and I jump still better than I used to, but not great,” Christensen said. “[Friday] was just one of those days where I just wasn’t on, I wasn’t feeling it right.” Nevertheless, an off-day for Christensen meant another top-five finish and another invaluable experience bonding with some of the best athletes around the country.“Yesterday was amazing,” Christensen said. “Destinee Hooker and [second place finisher] Elizabeth Patterson had great jumps. They both kept clearing bars on the first try, and Destinee got a new NCAA record. It was a really exciting meet to watch.”—Staff writer Kevin T. Chen can be reached at ktchen@fas.harvard.edu.

After taking last weekend off, the women’s water polo team traveled to Oneonta, N.Y. for its opening conference game of the season and an exhibition match-up. Despite a dominating performance from co-captain Devon MacLaughlin, who registered a total of seven goals on the day, the squad lost to both No. 13 Hartwick (14-6, 1-0 CWPA) and the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) on Saturday. The Crimson (4-6, 0-1 CWPA) dropped a shootout to NYAC, losing 17-16 in the non-NCAA match. Earlier in the day, Harvard could not prevent the Hawks’ offensive attack, suffering a 16-10 loss.“I feel like we have some things that we need to work on as a team as to how we handle adversity,” MacLaughlin said.The Crimson was missing freshman center and offensive contributor Devan Kennifer, who was nursing a sore elbow. Without Kennifer in the pool, MacLaughlin found herself tasked with the challenge of filling the void left by her fellow center.“[MacLaughlin] is a competitor,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said. “There’s no quit in the woman.”Next week, the Crimson will visit the west coast for a six-game trip, including a match-up against No. 1 Stanford. Harvard returns home to Blodgett Pool on April 4. The team will have a chance for revenge against Hartwick, followed by a match-up against Brown.“I’m excited to see how we come out against the number one team in the country,” MacLaughlin said. NYAC 17, HARVARD 16Last month, the Crimson split its two games against NYAC. On Saturday, 32 minutes was not enough to settle the rubber match, and the teams entered a shootout where Harvard could not pull out a victory.“It was definitely not one of our best games,” MacLaughlin said. “We can play much better than that.”Freshman Laurel McCarthy played between the pipes and recorded eight saves. Impressively, the first-year was able to stop a five-meter attempt in regulation as well as one attempt in the shootout, which took place instead of an overtime period, since the game was not under NCAA regulations.NYAC converted four out of five attempts, while the Crimson only successfully scored three.Sophomore Patricia Smith scored a team-high four goals in the game to go along with her three steals. Freshman Shannon Purcell and MacLaughlin each recorded a hat trick in the high-scoring affair. MacLaughlin also drew two ejections. Freshman Ita Barton-Kettleborough scored twice, and junior Kelly Peeler found the net once.HARTWICK 16, HARVARD 10The Crimson seniors on the team entered the game looking for their first victory over the conference powerhouse, as the squad has gone 0-15 against the Hawks since 2004.“Hartwick has been the perennial Northern Division champion, so obviously you want to stick a pin in their balloon,” Farrar said.After giving up six goals to Hartwick in the first eight minutes, the Crimson tried to play catch-up for the remainder of the game. “We didn’t defend the shallow end effectively in the first quarter, and that put us in a hole that we never really were able to dig ourselves out of,” Farrar said.The squad cut the lead to 8-5 in the second quarter. The teams traded three goals apiece before the Hawks went on a 5-2 run to end the game.“We just couldn’t quite close the gap,” Farrar said. “You cannot allow botched counterattacks to result in an easy goal the other way. The Hartwick players are experienced, very good opportunists, and they’re going to make you pay.”Harvard had several chances to cut the lead but could not capitalize, and instead gave the opposition plenty of opportunities in transition.Many of those breaks—although botched—were generated by freshman Lizzie Abbott and junior Kristina Bergquist, who drew a combined five ejections to create 6-on-5 situations.“We need to work on our 6-on-5s,” MacLaughlin said.The nine saves by co-captain Nicola Perlman, a former Crimson magazine chair, were not sufficient to contain the Hawks’ shooting front. Attempting to keep up with Hartwick’s offensive pace, McLaughlin tossed out four goals, while junior Roxanne Pinto and freshman Monica Zdrojewski netted two apiece. Peeler and Barton-Kettleborough each contributed with a goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring is a time of renewal and new beginnings. But for the Harvard men’s golf team, which found itself mired in the middle of the pack during the entirety of the fall season, spring play seem to be offering new results. With the kickoff to the spring season, the Crimson settled for ninth in the 14-team field at the GEICO Intercollegiate in Savannah, Ga.“It was nice to play again after resting up for five months,” rookie Mark Pollak said. “I know some of the other guys are disappointed with how they did, but we got to take it with a grain of salt because we’ve had such a long rest.”“Personally, I haven’t played a lot of golf over the winter, so it was great just getting outdoors and playing some golf,” junior Greg Shuman added.Despite the constant threat of rain and the dark clouds looming over the entire tournament, the weather held and the Crimson was able to get the full three rounds of 18 holes in.“It was good to get out into the sun and feel how it is to play again,” Pollak said.Leading the way for Harvard, Pollak finished in a four-way tie at sixth, shooting +10 in the three-round weekend. Pollack, who led all competitors at last fall’s Big 5 Invitational in par-5 holes, seems to be emerging as the indisputable anchor of the Crimson squad, despite being just a freshman.Junior Danny Mayer shot +16 to tie at 27th, while classmate Greg Shuman shot 19 over for a share of 39th. Shuman also finished as the third-best golfer on par-3 holes, averaging 3.08 strokes.“We got better as the tournament went on just from playing a ton of golf,” Shuman said.Despite settling for a share of 51st with a score of 22 over par, sophomore Louis Amira led the field in par-5 holes, finishing 5 strokes under par in those holes. Freshman Tony Grillo, at +31, took home 69th place, while captain Michael Shore finished 79th at +36, and junior Peter Singh rounded out the Crimson competitors, shooting +45 for a share of 86th.Tom Hayes of Savannah College of Art and Design led the course at three over par, shooting 72, 74, and 73 on the par-72 course.Day 1 of competition wasn’t very kind to the Harvard golfers, as almost every member of the team shaved strokes from his first round total to his second. Pollak, who finished just six strokes behind the daily leader Patrick Schiel of Southern Illinois University—who shot 71—at 77 on Day 1, improved to par on Day 2, finishing seven strokes behind the daily leader, Schiel’s Southern Illinois teammate Todd Obergoenner, who shot a formiddable 65 on the day.“I think everyone just got used to the course,” Pollak said. “And they moved a few tees a little bit.”But for Pollak, native of San Antonio, Texas, it was more than just a matter of getting used to the course, nor a gracious rearrangement of tees that helped him succeed.“I think I’m a lot quicker to pick up my game after a long break than some of the other guys,” Pollak said. “I’m from the South, which helps a bit too because the course we played on was a typical southern course.“I knew the grass and how to chip, especially around the green.”All told, the Crimson shot 317 on Day 1, 304 on Day 2, and 320 on Day 3 to finish the Intercollegiate at 941. Southern Illinois took the weekend crown, posting daily lows of 301 and 293 in the first two rounds of play, and, in the third round, the Salukis finished second to Bryant University, with 310 strokes to the Bulldogs’ 304. With those kind of postings, the Salukis easily coasted to victory at 904.On deck for Harvard, the team travels to the PGA West course in La Quinta, Calif. to take on UC Riverside over Spring Break before returning to New England to take on a slate of Ivy League opposition at the Yale Spring Opener.“Spring Break, we’re just all really excited to get out of New England,” Pollak said. “We’re all really looking forward to it. The Yale tournament is a crucial tournament. “A lot of Ivy League teams will be there, so it’ll be good to see how we do against them before the Ivy League tournament at the end of the season.”“We’re going to be really excited to get out [to California] and get some good golf in,” Shuman added. “We’re going to be competing with a lot of different Ivy league teams all season.”—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

When the Crimson scheduled its opening stretch of Southern games, it knew the risks of playing strong teams in midseason form. Harvard baseball (1-7) has benefited from challenging such high level competition in preparation for the Ivy season, but after a disheartening weekend—in which the Crimson dropped all four of its contests against UAB in Pensacola, Fla. and Birmingham, Ala.—the squad is looking to regroup and find its stride.“Honestly, [the weekend] was pretty disappointing,” freshman starter Brent Suter said. “We should have been more competitive, but we’ll learn from it and move on.”Despite a grim record, the Crimson has made some progress in its first two weeks of play. Many of Harvard’s young arms have seen action on the mound and the team’s bats have shown life throughout  the lineup.With another seven contests down south, the Crimson will have ample opportunity to prove itself against quality opponents, if it can fit all of its talented pieces together.“We’re just going to come out and keep playing hard,” captain Harry Douglas said. UAB 11, HARVARD 3The Crimson completed its four-game set at Vestavia High School but could not muster a victory after falling behind early. Suter (1-1) struggled to open the game, allowing all seven of his earned runs in the first three innings. The rookie worked out of a jam in the second, but failed to silence the Blazer offense.Harvard tried to respond behind RBI singles and two-hit days from senior Jon Roberts and sophomore Dillon O’Neill, but the Crimson was unable to spark a comeback against UAB ace Kyle Roberson (2-2). A Douglas homerun brought Harvard within 9-3 in the eighth, but the visitors’ relief pitching stumbled, as sophomore Taylor Meehan yielded two earned runs in the bottom half of the inning.UAB 13, HARVARD 7In Saturday’s evening game at Pensacola Junior College, the Crimson watched a commanding advantage evaporate once again. Harvard took an early 4-0 lead as freshman Jeff Reynolds doubled home two runs in the second inning, before being plated himself on a two-run bomb courtesy of junior Andrew Prince.Unfortunately for Harvard, the Blazers also enjoyed the long ball in Game 3, with Andrew Manning, Brint Hardy, and Austin Taylor collecting homers in the second, third, and fourth to earn a 5-4 lead.Senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich responded by unloading his second homer of the season, but UAB tacled on two more runs in the the sixth to take a 7-5 lead.The Crimson continued to fight hard, as back-to-back doubles in the eighth by Meehan and Albright tightened the contest and a Douglas single knotted the score at 7.Things soon fell apart for the visitors, though, as a solid relief effort from freshman Will Keuper (0-1) melted into a six-run frame. Through 3.1 innings of work, the rookie allowed only six hits, but fellow rookie Marcus Way and Stack-Babich allowed five inherited runners to score, saddling Keuper with the loss.UAB 13, HARVARD 0The Saturday morning contest brought the weekend’s most lopsided results in a difficult start for freshman Connor Hulse (0-2). The Blazers collected 18 hits on the day—14 against the rookie—and silenced their opponent behind starter Beau Pender’s five stellar innings. The UAB hurler struck out eight and watched the only Crimson scoring opportunity fall short, as a runner was thrown out at the plate in a fourth-inning fielder’s choice.The Blazers notched seven more runs in the fifth inning, pushing the lead to 13-0 and effectively ending the game after five frames.“We’re young and inexperienced against really good hitting teams,” said Suter of the young pitching staff. UAB 16, HARVARD 4The Crimson drew first blood in the series with four runs in the fourth inning. After struggling to solve lefty Shay Crawford (2-1) the first time through the lineup, Harvard’s sluggers found a groove as Stack-Babich, Albright, Douglas, and sophomore Sean O’Hara alternated singles and doubles. By the time Zailskas ripped a single through the left side, the Crimson enjoyed a 4-0 lead.Despite a strong outing from sophomore starter Dan Berardo, Harvard struggled after the second-year was forced from the game by a line drive into his glove hand. After allowing the tying run to score, Way yielded a three-run home run to take the loss for the Crimson.Up 7-4, the Blazers continued to build on their lead, setting the tone for an offensive weekend onslaught that Harvard could not match.—Staff writer Max N.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team met defeat and victory this weekend with a loss at Princeton and a win at East Stroudsburg.  The team, which has struggled on the road, gained its first road win of the season with the 3-0 victory over East Stroudsburg (4-7, 1-4 Hay).  In the 3-0 loss to Princeton (7-7), the team showed that it still has areas to improve on. “We’re really happy with that win,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd said. “We desperately needed a road win, and everything just came together, but now we’re looking for another before the season ends.”Freshman Matt Jones had a standout weekend, leading all players with 15 kills on a .360 attack percentage, along with five blocks and four digs in the Princeton matchup. Weissbourd turned in another outstanding performance, posting 19 kills with a .586 hitting percentage in the East Stroudsburg game.PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 0Harvard (7-6, 3-1 Hay) came out the locker room aggressively, jumping to a 6-3 lead. Princeton was able to mount a comeback to tie it up at 9-9. The Tigers then took control of the game, posting five-straight points to make it 14-9. Harvard trailed the Tigers for the rest of the stanza, but consecutive kills brought the Crimson within two at 19-17. The Tigers were able to hold on to the set, winning it 30-22.“We trailed them for most of the match, but we were always close,” junior Soren Rosier said. “Each set really came down to a couple of breakaway points.”Princeton opened up the second set with a 7-2 lead. The Tigers took advantage of Crimson errors to bring the lead to eight at 16-8. Harvard began a four-point comeback, with a service ace from junior Erik Kuld to make it 16-12. The Tigers then posted three more points, but the Crimson scored the next nine points to take the lead at 21-19. Control of the advantage then went back and forth for the next 11 serves until the Tigers posted two kills to take the stanza, 33-31.“They really closed out every set,” Weissbourd said.  “We would open strong, but they pulled away at the end of every set.”Princeton started the third set with a 3-1 lead before a kill from Kuld tied it up at 3-3. The Tigers extended their lead to 13-9, as Harvard trailed close behind. Jones posted a kill and a block to pull Harvard within two.  The Tigers took five of the next six points to make it 19-13. Princeton then pulled away to take the set and the match, 30-20.HARVARD 3, EAST STROUDSBURG 0The Crimson came into East Stroudsburg eager for a road win. Harvard held the Warriors to a .150 attack percentage in the first set to take it, 30-26. Harvard won the second set, 30-26, in similar fashion by holding the East Stroudsburg offense to a .212 attack percentage. In the third set, The Crimson tallied 17 kills with only one error for a .571 attack percentage, finishing the frame ahead 30-23. Harvard hit .390 for the match, compared to .181 for the Warriors.“We really needed the win to redeem ourselves,” Weissbourd said.  “I think we were more focused because we all wanted to finally get a win on the road.”Harvard faces MIT Tuesday at the Malkin Athletic Center, marking its second-to-last home game of the regular season.—Staff writer Evan Kendall can be reached at kendall@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s golf team enjoyed a fresh start with the beginning of spring season, defeating Lynn University Sunday at the Boca Woods Country Club in Boca Raton, Fla. Despite windy conditions, the Crimson walked away with a 309-325 victory. The squad dominated the course, posting the three lowest scoring rounds of the day.“This was a good way to start off,” senior Emily Balmert said. “The conditions were alright, and we all shot pretty well.”In addition to challenging the opposing field, the Crimson golfers also found themselves competing with each other, as junior Claire Sheldon edged out freshman Christine Cho, 75-76. The two took the first and second spots, while Balmert took the third spot, shooting a 77.“It’s always great to have three players take the top three,” Sheldon said. “They still fought hard for those spots.”Sophomore Mia Kabasakalis brought up the rear for the Crimson, shooting an 81 to take sixth place in the competition. Senior Ali Bode wasn’t far behind, posting an 83 for eighth place.“The course was fairly difficult, but we played well,” Sheldon said. “We didn’t risk a lot of shots and we were really focused. I think as a team we were happy with how we did.”Rounding out the Harvard lineup were juniors Sara Harvey and Caroline Vik, along with freshman Jane Lee. Harvey and Vik, both shot an 86, while Lee was one off with an 87.The Fighting Knights’ lowest score came from senior Katy McNicoll, who shot a 78.The 6050-yard par 72 course presented some difficulties, including some low-velocity winds that nevertheless forced the Crimson to change its approach.“The wind was mild but it still affected how we shot,” Balmert said. “The course was already challenging, but the wind made it that much harder.”The average Harvard score for the round was 82.94, indicating the depth of the Crimson squad. Harvard golfers also took five of the top eight spots on the score sheet.“We haven’t played in a long time so we were really eager to get out there,” Sheldon said. “We knew they were a decent team, but we were confident in our abilities.”The defending Ivy League champions look to establish momentum early on that will carry the team for the short season.“The season is so short that every win is important,” Sheldon said. “The first match is always important because it can really set the tone for the rest of the season.  “The spring season is really only a month long, so that win is really important in determining the rest of the season.”Coming off a championship season, the squad looks to hold onto to the top spot until the Ivy Championships.“We are really looking to remain competitive,” Balmert said. “Last season was good, but we are confident that we can do just as well this year and this match is a great start to that.”Harvard’s next match is Wednesday March 25 at UCLA.—Staff writer Evan Kendall can be reached at kendall@fas.harvard.edu.

The Sunshine State may be too hot for the Crimson to handle.  This weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team (4-6) headed south to Miami and Ft. Myers, Fla. to compete against No. 52 Florida International and Florida Gulf Coast.  The nationally-ranked Golden Panthers (11-5) and the Florida weather were too big of obstacles to overcome, and the Crimson dropped the match 6-1.  But the next day, a rejuvenated Harvard heated up the courts, taking down the Eagles (1-11) in a decisive 6-1 victory.HARVARD 6, FLORIDA GULF COAST 1With a night’s rest and a fresh outlook, the re-energized Crimson came out on fire against the Eagles. The well-rested Harvard team overcame the conditions Sunday to bounce back with newfound confidence.“Our mindset coming into the match today was to beat the heat and play hard.” Crimson coach Traci Green said.A resilient Harvard executed its game plan quite well, dominating Florida Gulf Coast in a crushing 6-1 victory.   Stepping up as the No. 1 because of an ill Peterzan, Rosekrans notched yet another win.“I approached [the No. 1 position] fairly calmly and took it one point at a time,” Rosekrans said. “It was exciting for me because I haven’t played No. 1 yet so far this season, so I felt like I had nothing to lose. And when you are given that opportunity, you have to rise to the challenge.”Playing the No. 1 spot is no easy feat, yet Rosekrans transitioned with ease, overpowering her opponent in straight sets.“We are really proud of the way she competed out there.” Green said. The Crimson has been flying under the radar, but Harvard thinks it will surprise a few teams this season.“We aren’t necessarily the favorite team,” Rosekrans said, “but we are looking to upset a lot of people in our upcoming matches.”FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL 6, HARVARD 1After battling Florida International in 90-degree, humid weather, the Crimson fell at No. 1, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 singles in straight sets.“We had a slow start, but the match was much closer than the score,” sophomore Samantha Rosekrans said.While finally seeing the sun and playing outdoors may have been a welcome adventure for the New Englanders, the wind and the heat proved to be unruly side effects that plagued Harvard throughout its play.A few of the Crimson players suffered major injuries from the conditions. Captain Laura Peterzan, filling in at the No.1 spot due to senior Beier Ko’s injured wrist, experienced heatstroke on Saturday, according to the team.“It was a difficult match because we had not been used to the outdoor conditions,” Rosekrans said. “It was a shock to all of us after playing indoor for four months straight.”Rosekrans, at No. 2, recorded the only win in the Saturday match, defeating Maria Spenceley in three sets, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.  Freshman Camille Jania, who played strongly against a fierce competitor, barely fell short. Jania faced nationally-ranked No. 120 Mariana Muci at the No. 3 spot.  She dropped the first set 7-6 (7-4), and won the second 6-4, but in the final tie-breaking set, she ultimately lost 10-4 to Muci.Realizing the challenge that it faced in such a high-caliber opponent in FIU, Harvard stuck together and maintained a positive attitude despite not experiencing much success. “We had nothing to lose [playing FIU],” Rosekrans said. “We are not a ranked team and while of course we wanted to win, we looked at it as an opportunity to build experience for Ivies and upcoming matches during spring break.”

It’s not every weekend that the Crimson men’s tennis team enjoys consecutive games on the road against “the Tribe” and “the Monarchs.”While such monikers together provoke colorful comparisons, No. 63 Harvard (6-4) offered its own contrast by recording a win and a loss versus No. 49 William & Mary (12-9) and Old Dominion (15-9), respectively.With only one point the difference in the two keenly-contested fixtures, it was a contrast not quite as vivid as tribalism and royalty.“We were outclassed in the doubles, which we thought we might be, and we fought incredibly hard in the singles,” head coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “I thought it was a great weekend of tennis.”In the absence of sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans due to illness and senior Sasha Ermakov due to injury, the Crimson rose to the challenge in a difficult weekend. In a greatly-changed singles and doubles lineup, freshman Alistair Felton competed at No. 2, while co-captain Michael Kalfayan returned to the lineup for the first time since February.“I think we went out there like tigers,” said co-captain Chris Clayton, who is currently No. 65 in the nation. “You roll with [the changes]—you never know what the season’s going to give you, and we’ve been handling it well.” HARVARD 4, WILLIAM & MARY 3 Looking to rebound from Saturday’s loss against Old Dominion, Sunday’s ranked opponent William & Mary was hardly Harvard’s ideal proposition; such concerns intensified upon the Crimson dropping the doubles point to the Tribe. However, Harvard silenced all doubt with a resounding singles performance, recording four straight wins to seal the game.“The level of play was up a level higher...it was quite a remarkable win today,” Fish said.In the doubles, William & Mary claimed an early advantage over the Crimson. At No. 1, Felton and junior Michael Hayes lost 8-4 to the Tribe’s Keziel Juneau and Sebastian Vidal, with No. 3 co-captain combination Kalfayan/Clayton beaten by the same score. Harvard secured a lone win, courtesy of the No. 2 duo of sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Davis Mangham; the pairing won 8-5 over counterparts Ilha Orre and Varun Pandit.With everything to play for in the singles, the Crimson rallied to swing the pendulum back in its favor. At No. 4, Mangham secured the equalizer with a 6-3, 6-1 win, while No. 1 Clayton defeated Juneau (6-3, 6-4) to help Harvard take the lead.“We weren’t fazed at all by the conditions,” Clayton said. “Whether it was losing the doubles point or being beaten in three straight sets in singles, at this point we are growing into a much tougher and competitive team than we’ve been this year.”With the Tribe’s advantage overturned, No. 2 Felton beat Marwan Ramadan (6-4, 7-5) for Kalfayan to clinch the decisive fourth point at No. 6 with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Pandit—the Crimson co-captain’s second singles win of the weekend.“Considering that Mike went down [with the team], had to turn in his thesis next Thursday, [and] literally studied non-stop, he played beautifully,” Fish said. OLD DOMINION 4, HARVARD 3 In Saturday’s fixture, Crimson hopes of a comeback following its loss of the doubles point rested on the shoulders of Alistair Felton—competing at No. 2 for the second time in his collegiate career, having battled back from a bagel in the first set.The score poised at 3-3, the freshman’s third-set tie-breaker against No. 106 in the nation Tobias Fanselow would decide the outcome.Unfortunately for Harvard, Felton succumbed 7-6(5), recording a 6-0, 2-6, 7-6(5) loss overall.“[Felton] was only one shot away from being up a break in the third,” Fish said. “He had the guy on the ropes, didn’t quite get it, [but] still came up with some big shots...he handled [playing at No. 2] beautifully.”The Crimson began by surrendering the doubles point to the Monarchs. No. 3 pairing Omodele-Lucien/Mangham recorded Harvard’s solitary win, defeating the Monarch’s Yakov Diskin and Alex Funkhouser (8-1).However, in a stirring response in the singles, the Crimson dominated further down the courts to set up Felton’s grandstand finish. At No. 5, Omodele-Lucien won in straight sets (6-2, 6-4), while No. 4 Mangham overturned a first-set loss to record a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph over Diskin. Finally, No. 6 Kalfayan marked his return to the singles lineup in victorious fashion, winning 3-6, 6-3, (10-7).“Our guys just never stopped competing—it was a very, very close match, a tremendous fight,” Fish said. “I thought we came incredibly close to pulling off an upset without a full group. It just showed how strong the guys down the lineup are, and how much they’ve improved.”—Staff writer Allen J. Padua can be reached at ajpadua@fas.harvard.edu.

The worst losses are the ones in which a team beats itself. Such was the case for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team Saturday afternoon in Providence, R.I, as the Crimson (2-3, 0-1 Ivy) fell to Brown (3-2, 1-0), 12-8, in a lackluster performance that left its players angry and disappointed.“I think that we shot ourselves in the foot,” senior Kaitlin Martin said. “I don’t think that Brown did anything really spectacular. We just threw it away.”Harvard sophomore Jess Halpern once again led her team with three goals, while senior Sarah Bancroft and Martin registered two scores each, but they could not match Brown’s total team effort. Eight different Bears found the back of the net, paced by senior Jesse Nunn, who had a game-high four goals as well as an assist.Coming off a heartbreaking overtime loss to No. 13 New Hampshire last Wednesday, the Crimson might have suffered a mental letdown in its league opener.“We didn’t really execute to the level we know we are capable of,” tri-captain Shannon Flynn said. “We haven’t quite meshed yet as a group.”Brown came out firing, tallying four straight goals in the first 8:07 and outscoring its visitors 7-1 in the first 20:48 of the game. Nunn scored her first goal little over a minute into the game, and freshman Katelyn Caro’s back-to-back goals solidified the advantage.Harvard could not muster any sort of response to the barrage, finding itself down 3-0 before the Crimson had taken a single shot. Finally, after nine minutes had passed, Halpern put her team on the scoreboard with an unassisted goal.“She’s so quick that she can get by any Division I defender,” Martin said. “It’s just that it takes a team to win the game, and when not everyone shows up to play, she can’t do it alone.”Nunn responded with a score of her own just 37 seconds later, returning the lead to four.The following nine minutes were scoreless, but two Bear goals, including Nunn’s second, increased Harvard’s deficit to 7-1 with 9:12 left in the half.“We didn’t show up to play,” Martin said. “We dig ourselves into these huge holes, and then we’re playing catch-up for the rest of the game, and it’s just not a way to play.”It was then that the Crimson seemed to wake up, closing the half with three unanswered and unassisted goals to cut the Bear lead at the break to 7-4. Two of those tallies came off Halpern’s stick, and one from freshman standout Tyler Petropulous, who also collected four ground balls and won two draw controls.The scoring run provided a welcome conclusion to a less than ideal half by Harvard, which had 12 turnovers and five ground balls to Brown’s three and 14, respectively.The Harvard comeback attempt continued into the second period, as the Crimson scored twice, punctuated by Martin’s eight-meter strike, to make it a one-goal game after two minutes of play.But Harvard would be unable to even things up. After a Bear goal pushed the advantage back to 8-6, Martin returned with a free-position score at 8:10. Nunn’s final tally a minute later extended the Bears’ lead, but the gap shrank to 9-8 on Bancroft’s second goal of the game.The Crimson would be held scoreless for the rest of the contest, and the Bears finished on a three-goal run to secure their first Ivy League win of the season.The statistics present a telling tale of the tape, as Harvard went 10-21 on clears and was outshot by the hosts, 19-35.“We didn’t take quality opportunities on offense, and we weren’t able to get the ball through the midfield to have that many opportunities on offense,” Martin said.The Crimson returns to action 4 p.m. Wednesday at Connecticut in a nonleague matchup. —Staff writer Dennis J.

CORRECTION APPENDED
Joining The New York Times's editorial page tomorrow in mid-April will be former Crimson columnist Ross Gregory Douthat '02, who at 29 is set to be the youngest columnist for the Grey Lady "ever"--filling in after Bill Kristol '73's illustrious yearlong tenure.  Details on his extensive views on Harvard's curriculum after the jump.
Oh, the Core.  Right after his faux nostalgia for the Core's specialized mainstays, Douthat then pours on the acid:
Douthat would be happy about the fact that the Core is getting eliminated, then--right?  No, it turns out he hates the new General Education program as much as the Core.  When Harvard's Faculty approved Gen Ed in May 2007, Douthat lambasted the new legislation in his blog for The Atlantic:
FlyBy teems with anticipation at the expected Douthat column on Harvard's curriculum, as this has been his focus since leaving his Quincy house residence.  It may be the only time a good number of Harvard students agree with the conservative columnist's thoughts.  Oh, and have you been trying out different pronunciations of his name while reading this?  FlyBy's got you covered: it's DOW-thut.
CORRECTION: The original version of "Ross Douthat and Gen-Ed" stated that Douthat would be joining the New York Times the day after the post ran.  In fact, he has been hired for the columnist position, but will not begin writing columns until mid-April.  The Crimson regrets the error.

(Hey Peter, there's always the shuttle, but be warned that nobody will want to visit you because Dunster might as well be part of some imaginary netherland tucked far, far away from human civilization. The reality is that it'll take you about 7 minutes to get to the Yard by foot.)
Rooming: Exposing. Dunster is notorious for its walkthroughs. Sure, you'll probably have a "single" all four years, but understand that you'll likely end up in the common room, all of your private thoughts and feelings unpackaged for all to see. You will be caught in various states of undress by your roommate, and you will always say "Why don't we just go to your room" after that particularly boozy shindig. But there are some nice suite arrangements for upperclassmen where common rooms can finally be used for their intended purposes.
Dining Hall: Luminous. Dunster's dhall has a rep for being the most beautiful on campus—but luckily, this often remains unsubstantiated lore because nobody really makes the effort to come all the way, and no crowds means no lines and more Mandarin orange slices for you. Also, the servery literally gleams. The napkin holders are shaped like moose (meese?). The low-hanging chandeliers soften your skin tone.
House List: Putrescent. I mean, it's called "Moose Droppings." Of the dry, flaky, uninteresting sort.
House Masters: Providers of gustatory happiness. The Porters are the parents you never had—that is, the wildly accomplished, alarmingly attractive, and unbearably nice parents you would probably not actually want. The Porters host bountiful open houses at their residence, more regularly than your girth would like (watch out for Mrs. Porter's apple pie). Besides providing Dunster residents an alternative to the grille (a great place for cheap eats—but if you live in C-entryway, be warned of the wandering fumes), the Porters will gladly be your dinner date. The couple is known to flit about the dining hall to sit down with every diner they see. If you're lucky enough, Mrs. Porter will have her glassy-eyed poodle in her arms.
House Culture: Sake bomb. Forget Stein Clubs: happy hours are pretty legit at Dunster. The themes may range from the sophisticated (specific wine and cheese pairings) to the bizarrely delightful ("1-2-3-sake bomb!!"), but one theme has been consistent this year: eventual devolution into sloppy dancing. As for non-alcohol-based modes of community-building, Dunster ensures those warm, fuzzy feelings during the seasons, particularly around Christmas time when a giant evergreen graces a corner of the dining hall and residents write thank you cards to each other and hugs abound. Someone grab me some Kleenex.
The Verdict: Junk.* Okay, so one thing you will learn as soon as you're given Dunster is that people will assume you're unhappy. And granted, you may be. But there comes a point when the following interchange gets old:
- What house are you in?
- You know, Dunster. [note: no indication of positive or negative emotions]
- Oh, well at least you have a nice dining hall. [sympathetic pat on shoulder]
Dunster's blemishes are often overemphasized and its boons underappreciated. That said, if the location and rooming doesn't get you down, the mere fact that you will get so much crap for being in Dunster may very well make living here unfortunate. Also, the upswing in House culture may be pushing Dunster towards investment-grade, so fear not, moose children.

Although FlyBy’s name evokes images of chicken salad sandwiches in shrink wrap, we’d like to think we have good taste. What could be better, then, than an opportunity to don our Sunday best and dine amidst freshly pressed linens and candlelight? But alas, in a recession, this luxury is becoming more difficult to afford. Thankfully, Boston’s Winter Restaurant Week starts today, running through March 20 and continuing from March 22 through March 27. More details after the jump.
For readers new to the scene, during restaurant week, Boston’s eateries (including some of the most upscale and celebrated) offer three course prix fixe menus at $20.09 for lunch and $33.09 for dinner. This year, 224 Boston-area restaurants are participating, and, for the first time, some restaurants are serving a two-course lunch for only $15.09.  That’s only slightly more expensive than a HUDS dinner—but instead of another variation of chicken and overcooked pasta, you can dine on seared ahi tuna, yellowtail sole with haricots verts, brandade potatoes and nicoise olive and tomato vinaigrette (at Harvest). FlyBy has some restaurant week tips:
- Make RESERVATIONS, as the venues are usually packed for most of Restaurant Week
- Read the menus before you choose a restaurant at www.restaurantweekboston.com. There isn’t much selection on the prix fixe menus, so make sure your pick has food you like.
- Don’t want to venture outside of the bubble? The following restaurants in the Square are participating: Chez Henri, Grafton   Street, Harvest, Henrietta’s Table, OM, Rialto, Upstairs on the Square, Atrium at the Inn at Harvard, and Redline.
FlyBy will be classing up to take full advantage of the occasion. We’ve already got our eye on L’Espalier and Sandrine's Bistro!

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you’ll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
When you first hear you’re in Mather House, your first thought will probably be, “ha ha, my linkmates are probably in Dunster!” Your second thought will probably be, “shit shit shit, that ugly box is so far away.” But fear not, Mather spirit will keep you warm and toasty on those long, snowy walks to Northwest Labs.
Location: Far. Nestled on bustling* Cowperthwaite Street, Mather is the most distant River House. Some might call this an inconvenience, but at least it’s closer than the quad**—and while quadlings tread through Cambridge Common every morning, the commute from Mather is 100% syringe free. Your savior on those rainy days is the shuttle, which stops right outside every 10 minutes (sometimes) and conveys you to your destination with speed and efficiency (sometimes). While the 10 a.m. shuttle is as packed as a clown car, the early-morning Rihanna on the bus' radio takes most of the beating out of the ride.
*False  **Offer only valid with Yard classrooms and dorms.  Excludes Science Center, Law School, Hemenway...anything north of Sever, basically.
Rooming: Concrete and spacious. While Mather House may look like the bastard child of Optimus Prime and a cement truck…well, isn’t that pretty badass? While the non-initiate might call it an "eyesore" or "big block of fugly," any Matherite will tell you that the exterior is redeemed by an enviable interior. Every resident is guaranteed a "cozy" single within a suite, eliminating the numbing isolation and social depravity of those lonely Quad singles. In the low-rise, sophomores and juniors get two-story suites with 4-6 singles and a party-friendly common room. In the tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in Cambridge, seniors look down on other Houses (literally and figuratively) from the commanding heights of their 18th-floor singles. Yes, the architecture, which residents have affectionately dubbed "Soviet bloc," is unlike any other Harvard House.  Prospective residents should note that, in the event of nuclear holocaust, only Mather House and Dunster’s roaches will survive. (Don't worry, they won't last long: roaches can't live in concrete.)
Dining Hall: Airport chic. Polka-dot upholstery aside, Mather dining hall is the center of House life, providing residents with comfy chairs and modern tables to eat, do work, or bro out. With enormous windows facing the Charles River, the setting sun provides automatic romance at dinnertime. The dining staff is cheerful and the food is delicious (because, hey, it's HUDS!) and many Matherites never leave. Which is fine, because unlike other Houses, Mather keeps its brain break open all night long. Until recently, the late-night food selection lagged behind other Houses', but HoCo has recently instituted plans to provide more exotic fare than bagels and cereal. Hummus and pita chips are available once a week, except when Eleganza models, doing their best to thwart stereotypes, descend upon the dining hall en masse to gorge themselves.
House list: Like drinking from a fire hose. Mather-Open, subscribers quickly find, overflows your inbox with love letters, embarrassing disclosures, heated debates, and daily requests for tower residents to turn down the Beyoncé. It’s a testament to the friendliness and community spirit of Mather House that no plea for strobe lights, bedsheets (?), blowup hammers, or the fax machine (don’t ask about the fax machine) goes unanswered.
Housemasters: Loving. Currently in their seventeenth year, Sandra and Leigh are among Harvard’s longest-tenured housemasters. Their monthly open houses (next one’s on housing day!) make you wonder how you ever endured Annenberg, with huge platters of sushi, dumplings, eggnog, brownies, chocolate-covered strawberries, and of course the famous monkeybread. Always around to offer a smile, the masters are such a fixture that the Mather mascot,* Leighdra the lion, bears their names.
*Note: the Mather mascot is also occasionally a gorilla. It’s complicated.
House culture: Unrivalled. Mather spirit is legendary, second only to Mather love. You may have seen the Mather flag proudly waving across the field at Harvard-Yale halftime. Or you may have caught venereal disease(s) from the infamous Mather Lather. Mather's very active HoCo offers biweekly happy hours (which, unlike Dunster's, last 2 hours) with carefully selected themes ranging from “Jungle Olympics” to, most recently, “Dinoswhores and Brobots.” Some houses only have enough spirit for intramural competitions (*cough* Winthrop *cough*). Mather, however, focuses its energy on the Louie Cup, a Mather-only contest spanning the year and involving such feats of endurance and displays of talent as competitive coin-flipping, staring contests, paper-airplane making, and “detecting that there is not in fact a Louie Cup event this week.” Finally, because every Mather suite is a party suite, you’ll never have to go out looking on Friday night, because it’s probably next door, and you're always invited.
Overall rating: AA.* What? Seriously? Partly because we like to buck trends, partly because even if we gave a AAAAA we'd get emails telling us that "OMGZMATHARRRIS THEBEST HOUSE EVARRR," and partly because...we don't know, this is pretty insane actually.  Kind of like Mather.  Like pornography, you know Mather spirit when you see it.
