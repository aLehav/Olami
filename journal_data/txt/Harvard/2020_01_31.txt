After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a Harvard student, you carry a unique sense of pride by being part of a best-in-class institution. You’re expected to work hard and make large sacrifices to succeed. In return, you anticipate the preeminence and integrity synonymous with the Harvard name to support alumni as they advance in this world.
In March 2019, serious doubts about Harvard’s integrity surfaced by way of disturbing attitudes and practices from both our University administration and the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the legal battle now underway about images of slaves, court documents and various media coverage depict our school’s dismissive, aggressive behavior toward descendants of slaves.
The lawsuit, filed by Tamara K. Lanier on March 20, 2019, alleges that Harvard and the Peabody have used, published, sold rights to, and displayed images of two slaves, Renty and Delia, for profit, for years.
The Laniers offer extensive genealogical research, such as census records and slave inventories, to support their claim of relation to Renty and Delia. They first reached out to Harvard in 2011 to share their research, establish lineage, and learn of the intentions for future use of their family members’ images. Sadly, neither Harvard nor the Peabody opened their doors to them, according to Lanier’s complaint. In response to being ignored, and after witnessing Harvard use images of their family repeatedly without permission, the Laniers filed suit against Harvard and the Peabody.
Students and alumni, we call upon you to ask yourselves: “Can we be proud of this?” Here are three moral challenges to consider.
Challenge One: When asked by The Crimson about the lawsuit, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said, “I think we have the law on our side.”
In a motion to dismiss filed recently, Harvard did not even dispute the Laniers’ ancestry. Instead, the University is leveraging property law to argue ownership of slave photos — while a family is fighting for the images to be recognized, respected, and surrendered to them as family property. This position is thoughtless at best.
Students believe Harvard to be an advanced, progressive institution promoting freedom, equality, diversity, knowledge, and peace. However, our administrators are not promoting these ideals, and apparently must be reminded that laws once supported slave codes and fugitive slave acts. Did Bacow forget Jim Crow or that our Supreme Court once ruled segregation legal?
This is not an issue of law; this is an issue of morality and recognizing the persistent institutional violence perpetuated by the University toward slaves.
Challenge Two: Harvard administrators claim their use and display of Renty and Delia’s images emphasize the slaves’ humanity.
But the photos of these slaves were taken in the 1850s during the height of slavery. According to the complaint, Renty and his daughter were stripped, photographed, and cataloged, all without their consent. More importantly, the photos were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, who sought evidence to support theories that humans had more than one origin (and thus that Africans were subhuman).
The disturbing context of that time and situation is frozen in the faces of Renty and Delia and can never be changed (not even by Harvard). Moreover, the persistent entitlement that Harvard and the Peabody have demonstrated to these images strongly questions their own concepts and definitions of humanity.
Challenge Three: In December 2019, the Peabody’s director, Jane Pickering, assumed and appointed the museum an “ethical steward” of both images and stories of Renty and Delia, and announced its intention to further publicly promote them.
But who anointed Pickering with the divine authority to assume stewardship over the images of Renty and Delia, and how could the Peabody suddenly possess stories of them? They have not opened their doors to the Laniers, and therefore have no new insights to offer. To insinuate otherwise is reckless.
Perhaps our most important question: Why must we remind Harvard and its affiliates that it is not their duty to own images or stories of enslaved people?
Harvard has taken some steps in the right direction. In late November 2019, Bacow admitted to institutional ignorance related to the depths of Harvard’s contributions to slavery and appointed the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery.
We also do agree with Pickering’s December statement that the Peabody “can, and should, do more” to open its doors to descendants of slaves, to support their search for stolen lineage, and to contribute to the discovery of their heritage.
But that alone is not enough. Both Harvard and the Peabody must stop promoting and exploiting images of Renty and Delia. At minimum, we must show respect to the Lanier family and wait for a ruling on the lawsuit.
The student-led Harvard Coalition to Free Renty will congregate in coming weeks to review the Lanier case and take a critical look at how our school treats descendants of slaves. We will continue to spread student awareness while calling upon Bacow and the Peabody to immediately surrender these images to the Lanier family, while continuing good faith dialogue in the exploration of reparations.
Harvard and the Peabody have a responsibility to support slave descendants, not battle families to own their stories. This lawsuit, partnered with Harvard’s entitled behavior, not only deeply wounds student morale and pride, but smears the Harvard name and the integrity attached to it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the First-Year Retreat during Wintersession this January, about fifty freshmen and facilitators were sitting in a dark hall, each holding an electric candle with a switch to turn it on and off. Then each student, one by one, shared what they were grateful for and turned the candle on. When the circle ended, they shared what they struggled with in the first semester and turned the candle off. In the end, everyone said what they were looking forward to in the upcoming semester and once again, the room gradually had all the candles lit.
What struck me most about this experience was that during my short time at Harvard, even though I wanted to so badly, I never experienced this deep level of connection with my fellow classmates on my struggles and aspirations at Harvard on this big of a scale.
Amid the never-ending string of “How are you?” and “Very good” that occurs on a daily basis, there is often limited space to discuss what is really happening in our lives. I began to notice that I preferred saying that I was “stressed” rather than admit that I was lonely and would rather say I was “tired” than sad. I remember sitting in my room during first semester, scrolling through the “Harvard Confessions” Facebook page and only there did I see admissions of any kind of struggle, rather than in my day-to-day interactions with others. It seemed like it was considered more acceptable to be exhausted to death rather than to feel normal emotions of loneliness or sadness at Harvard.
I have to emphasize that of course this was not the case with every single interaction. There were vulnerable and open conversations that helped me feel deep connection and people who were willing to go beyond the usual surface level in our interactions. Those people and conversations were integral to my growth for the last few months and helped me feel connected and at home. Nevertheless, the predominant Harvard culture seemed to disregard vulnerability as “weak” and preferred that we disguise ourselves in the endless workload.
This was why hearing my fellow freshmen share their difficulties from the tumultuous first semester and what they are grateful for despite that affected me so deeply; it was an experience I was looking for all along. The whole retreat was an amazing chance to reflect and get to know others in a more intimate and relaxed setting just before the semester. Sessions like this made me realize how much we need the same kind of openness on campus.
I am a fan of Brené Brown and her pursuit of wholehearted life of vulnerability, courage, and openness. One of the primary messages she sends through her books and talks is that vulnerability is not a weakness but is a form of courage. Genuine connections and all the good feelings of joy and belonging seem to arise from letting ourselves be seen without filters. Raw. Just as we are, with all our imperfections and struggles. Brené’s words encapsulate this idea when she says, “In one of its earliest forms, the word courage meant ‘To speak one's mind by telling all one's heart.’ Over time, this definition has changed, and today, we typically associate courage with heroic and brave deeds...This definition fails to recognize the inner strength and level of commitment required for us to actually speak honestly and openly about who we are and about our experiences — good and bad. Speaking from our hearts is what I think of as ‘ordinary courage.’”
It takes incredible bravery to let ourselves be seen and it takes open-mindedness and empathy to accept when others do the same as well.
I hope that we can cultivate vulnerability in our lives, whether it be by opening up to someone or listening to how our friends are really feeling. Step by step. Even though it may not happen overnight, we could start building a little space for being vulnerable and genuinely sharing at Harvard, even without a candle that turns on and off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Forward, a group of students and alumni concerned about climate change and seeking Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuels by electing members to the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, announced last week it had gathered nearly enough signatures to put its entire slate of candidates on the ballot for the upcoming election of new Overseers.
This petition by Harvard Forward is an embodiment of how we believe the University ought to be governed: openly, transparently, and democratically. We hope that the University can be receptive to Harvard Forward’s demands and that they can be incorporated into the Board’s plans.
Harvard Forward is a model of stellar grassroots advocacy for issues that Harvard Alumni are passionate about. We believe that the Board of Overseers election is the perfect forum to advocate for such issues.
The possible inclusion of Harvard Forward candidates on the Board of Overseers ballot is reminiscent of a similar movement that occurred 30 years ago when Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid successfully managed to nominate and elect candidates onto the Board of Overseers, including Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu. During those elections, members of Harvard’s administration supported members of the official slate of candidates in letters sent to alumni. The university changed voting guidelines to list other candidates separately on the ballot from those endorsed by the University, which HRAAA claimed was an attempt to influence the election that violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
We hearken back to this case to admonish the administration’s interference in those elections and to warn them to respect the electoral process in the event that Harvard Forward successfully nominates its candidates. If the University chooses not to put itself on the right side of history by divesting, then the least it could do is remain neutral in the elections. The Board of Overseers can only be an accurate representation of alumni sentiment if University officials do not meddle in the election of its members.
We also appreciate how Harvard Forward is united with current campus movements that we have supported such as graduate student unionization and ethnic studies. We believe that advocacy on these issues, in addition to fossil fuel divestment, is imperative. Harvard Forward is taking important steps to press the concerns of many current students and alumni within the administrative bodies of the University.
Finally, in line with our precedent supporting fossil fuel divestment, we support Harvard Forward’s efforts to ensure the University finally does divest from fossil fuels. More specifically, Harvard Forward’s work to produce thoughtful guidelines regarding best environmentally conscious investment practices is commendable. We believe informed conversations on investments are essential to facilitating the transition to a carbon-free future, and we would like to see Harvard Forward candidates help move Harvard forward toward fossil fuel divestment.

A federal judge set bail for Harvard Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber — who is charged with concealing funding he received from the Chinese government — at $1 million in cash in a hearing Thursday afternoon.
Lieber — a renowned nanoscientist who holds the esteemed title of University Professor at Harvard — was arrested on Tuesday morning and charged with lying to federal investigators about his involvement with China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a program initiated in 2008 to attract overseas researchers. The plan was labeled as a national security and economic threat by United States Senate committees.
Lieber, handcuffed behind his back in an orange jumpsuit, was escorted in and out of court by United States Marshals at Thursday’s hearing. His bail must be delivered by next Thursday, per U.S. District Court of Massachusetts judge Marianne B. Bowler.
Bowler also required Lieber and his wife, Jennifer Lieber — who is co-signing the bond — to surrender their passports. She barred them from applying new travel documents.
Bowler said during the hearing that she gave “considerable thought” to the final bail agreement, which she had already once denied on Tuesday after prosecutors labelled Lieber a “serious flight risk.”
Prosecutors initially asked Thursday that Lieber’s bail be set at $1.5 million, requesting that his Lexington, Mass. home be used as collateral. Bowler said she decided not to accept the property as part of the bond.
Bowler said that she felt “comfortable” that the $1 million bond “can be met and fulfilled in a number of days” after reviewing Lieber’s finances.
While awaiting trial, Lieber is required to stay within the District of Massachusetts. Any cash withdrawal larger than $20,000 by Lieber and his wife must be approved by the court; he is also required to disclose information about any foreign bank accounts he maintains.
Bowler also prohibited Lieber from directly or indirectly contacting Wuhan University of Technology, Peking University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Lieber received more than $1.5 million from Wuhan University of Technology in conjunction with the Thousand Talents Plan in addition to a $50,000 monthly salary, plus $150,000 in annual living expenses for “significant periods” from 2012 to 2017, per the criminal complaint in his case.
On Tuesday, prosecutors charged Lieber alongside two other Chinese researchers. Of those two researchers, one is affiliated with Harvard Medical School and charged with attempting to smuggle research to China and the other allegedly holds a lieutenant rank in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.
The charges against the researchers come as both the federal government and Harvard undertake a campaign to root out “academic espionage,” a process by which scientists pass academic research at American universities to foreign governments.
Prior to accepting the bail agreement, Lieber’s lawyers said Lieber “anticipates” being contacted via email by individuals on the prohibited list. Bowler said that so long as he does not respond, this is not in violation of the bail agreement — since “unless he deletes his email address,” he cannot prohibit people from contacting him.
At the conclusion of the hearing, Bowler said Lieber will be released after the bail agreement is signed and processed.

Harvard faculty, students, and visiting scholars crowded into the Barker Center’s Thompson Room Thursday to attend “The Legacy of Dominicanidad: A Symposium on the Work of Lorgia García Peña,” a day-long panel hosted by the Warren Center for Studies in American History.
In accordance with the Warren Center’s 2019-2020 theme, “Past, Present, and Future of Ethnic Studies,” the symposium aimed to honor Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña’s work in Latinx studies and to advocate for an expansion of ethnic studies at Harvard.
Soon after the event began at 9 a.m., a sign outside the room indicated it was at full capacity. Attendees unable to claim a seat squeezed together on the couches bordering the room or sat on the floor.
Nicole M. Guidotti-Hernández, a visiting scholar at the Warren Center, described this year’s theme as a “really important milestone” in the history of ethnic studies.
“The Warren Center wanted to have a structured conversation about it as a year-long set of programs and as an intellectual project,” she said.
The morning panel focused on García Peña’s scholarship and contribution to the advancement of ethnic studies at Harvard and beyond. Panelists praised García Peña’s 2016 book, "The Borders of Dominicanidad: Race, Nation, and Archives of Contradiction," which explores the ways well-known histories have drawn racial borders between Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.
Harvard Divinity School and African and African-American Studies Professor Cornel R. West ’74, a member of the panel, praised the “historical timing” of García Peña’s book.
“Your work is even more pioneering in the sense that it comes on the wave of this magnificent, sophisticated indictment of a U.S. empire that is in such decline and decay,” West said, addressing García Peña, who attended the event.
“Your first book is going to last — it’s going to endure,” West added.
After a lunch where attendees mingled amongst themselves over coffee and refreshments, a second panel titled “Dominicanidad's Diasporic Reverberations” continued the discussion by examining García Peña’s research more specifically.
Another panel dove into García Peña’s scholarly legacy following her recent tenure denial. García Peña was denied tenure in December, sparking students and scholars to protest the outcome.
After the panelists’ closing remarks, several students from the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition — many of whom were taught by Garcia Peña — led a demonstration at the front of the room, carrying a banner that read “WANT DIVERSITY? TEACH OUR HISTORIES.”
“It was heartening to see the students here today and their participation,” Warren Center visiting scholar Marisol LeBrón said.
In fall 2018, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said she was looking to recruit faculty who specialize ethnic studies before creating a formal program. FAS is currently undertaking a faculty search for three or four tenured or tenure-track professors who specialize in Asian American studies, Latinx studies, and Muslim American studies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Central Kitchen, a staple in Central Square for the past two decades, is closing its doors to make way for a recreational marijuana dispensary.
The new dispensary — called Western Front — is expected to open within 3-5 months, according to Dennis A. Benzan, the company’s co-founder. The company received licensing as an economic empowerment recipient through a Massachusetts program that aims to include groups disproportionately affected by past state and federal drug policies in the legal cannabis industry.
“Historically, communities of color and minorities have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs,” Benzan said. “And so now that it’s legal, it’s imperative that we do everything possible to permit the minority community to enter the cannabis industry.”
Benzan, who previously served as the Vice Mayor of Cambridge and was the first Latino ever elected to the City Council, said his company plans to hire workers from minority groups disproportionately affected by past drug policies.
“A big component of how we function is going to be the workforce development program that we’re going to have in place for the minority community,” he said.
Despite state efforts, very few marijuana business licenses have gone to minority owners.
“It’s important that the state and the municipal governments begin to prioritize and assist economic empowerment applicants in any way to enter the market,” Benzan said. “Historically, communities of color and minorities have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs.”
“Now that it’s legal, it’s imperative that we do everything possible to permit the minority community to enter the cannabis industry,” he added.” It’s incredibly difficult. It’s a very, very hard process.”
Western Front is also attempting to open a location in Chelsea, a suburb of Boston.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick urged city residents to keep in mind restrictions against marijuana use that remain on the books in an emailed statement. State law still prohibits use for those under age 21, as well as open containers of marijuana in vehicles on the road and driving while under the influence, he noted.
Massachusetts legalized recreational marijuana use with a ballot referendum in 2016 and the Cambridge City Council greenlighted legislation last year that allowed for weed dispensaries to open in the city. The legislation, passed in September 2019, prioritized individuals from historically marginalized groups in the allocation of permits.
“Cambridge overwhelmingly approved the recreational cannabis, so we believe that there is a strong adult market in the greater Boston area,” Benzan said. “More importantly is really the impact it’s going to have for the minority community in terms of hiring and really allowing them to enter into the cannabis industry.”

A decade-long project to digitize every 17th- and 18th- century manuscript and archive in Harvard’s collections relating to North America will be finished this semester, according to University Archivist Megan Sniffin-Marinoff.
The project, called Colonial North America at Harvard Library, will make more than 600,000 photographs of the documents publicly available online for the first time. Part of the collection is already accessible to the public.
The materials are “enough to make it possible to rethink the origins of education in the U.S. and in fact the origins of the U.S. itself,” Robert C. Darnton ’60, the University Librarian when the project started, wrote in an email.
For the project, workers catalogued the documents from 14 different repositories across Harvard and brought them to an imaging center in Widener Library. While the manuscripts in the Houghton and Widener Libraries could be brought in through tunnels, those from the Business School and the Medical School had to cross the Charles River.
“It's been a giant coordinating activity,” Sniffin-Marinoff said.
In the process of cataloguing, archivists uncovered historically important documents they weren’t aware they had, according to Sniffin-Marinoff.
“Truthfully, really, people didn't know some of this stuff was here,” she said. “I realized that we easily had incredible materials from about 150 years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence because of when Harvard was founded.”
College Fellow in History Zachary B. Nowak said that the archival collection will make it significantly easier for ordinary people to conduct in-depth historical research.
“You can now write not only about Roosevelt, but you can try to write the biography of Teddy Roosevelt's butler, which is a much harder history to write,” he said. “Writing the lives of everyday people — that project becomes way easier.”
History professor Joyce E. Chaplin said that the project brings together a diverse set of histories and perspectives.
“They didn't define it as British America or Colonial British America,” Chaplin said. “That would have restricted it to a narrow understanding of what early America was.”
“I think it's also great that they're including a lot of indigenous material — it's the people who were colonized, and not just the colonizers, so I think it's a really great expansive definition of whose history matters for early America,” she added.
All of these materials will be freely available online, allowing those who may not be able to travel to Harvard to view the documents in person.
“I think one really simple thing that all this digitization does is it makes those archives accessible from a distance. And I think that can't be underestimated, how powerful that is,” Nowak said.
Still, Chaplin hopes people will continue to visit the University’s collections to see the documents in person.
“I do think there's a wonderful experience of being in an archive and actually handling the stuff,” Chaplin said.

The College’s new enrollment system for its required General Education program rolled out this week to mixed reviews.
In previous semesters, many instructors teaching Gen Ed courses conducted independent lotteries to keep their course enrollment below capacity. But this spring, the Gen Ed office piloted a new coordinated lottery system, asking students to rank all their Gen Ed course choices and seek enrollment through a centralized randomization process.
The Gen Ed office began developing the coordinated lottery system in collaboration with several other University offices after noticing that some students successfully lotteried into many Gen Ed courses while others only lotteried into one.
“You told us that the lottery system was too confusing, too uncoordinated, and too stressful. We listened,” the Gen Ed office’s website states.
Some students said they were pleased with the new system.
“I lotteried into five classes and so far I’ve gotten four of the five I wanted,” Haneul H. Shin ’23 said. “It seems to work pretty well.”
Others said they had little success with the new lottery.
“I applied to four of them and none of them accommodated or let me into that GenEd course,” Brian Ma ’23 said. “I feel like this lottery system is worse than what they did last semester.”
Many experienced difficulties accessing the online course catalog through the my.harvard system Wednesday afternoon — the same day that Gen Ed lottery submissions were due.
Tim Bailey, a spokesperson for Harvard University Information Technology, wrote in an emailed statement that HUIT was aware of the problem.
“HUIT understands the frustration this causes at a critical time for course enrollment, and sincerely apologizes to the Harvard community for the inconvenience,” he wrote.
History professor William C. Kirby — who teaches GENED 1101: “The Business of China” and taught GENED 1136: “Power and Civilization: China” last semester — wrote in an email that he believes the new Gen Ed lottery system is fairer than lotteries held in previous semesters.
“In the past our lotteries struck me as often unfair: not privileging students who had actually preselected a class or those who had been lotteried out of a class in earlier years,” he wrote. “The new GenEd lottery by contrast strikes me as a serious effort to meet the highest priorities of students. I hope it works well.”
Kirby added, however, that he thinks pre-registration for courses would be a better system.
“In the absence of some form of preregistration, which allows for better academic planning, we may never have an ideal system, but colleagues who have planned the new GenEd lottery have given the challenges very careful thought and planning,” he wrote.
In 2018, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences debated a proposal to adopt pre-registration in lieu of shopping week, a period at the beginning of each semester when students may try out courses before officially enrolling. After months of discussion, FAS voted in 2019 to retain shopping week until at least 2022.

Despite declining endowment returns since current Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar began his tenure, experts say the recent performance figures are not necessarily indicative of his success in the role.
Nearly three years ago, Narvekar announced a five-year plan to overhaul the internal structure of the University’s investment-management arm.
The primary changes that Narvekar outlined in the plan included shifting from a unique “hybrid” investment model — one in which HMC retained a large internal staff in addition to hiring outside money managers — to relying more heavily on external firms, a practice consistent with many other university endowments. The plan also included laying off about half of HMC’s then-230-person staff.
Narvekar planned to pursue a broader investment strategy that involves less “silo investing” — in which employees specialize in various asset classes — and move to a “generalist” model where employees focus on overall endowment performance.
“Major change is never easy and will require an extended period of time to bear fruit,” Narvekar wrote in a letter to Harvard affiliates at the time.
Since then, HMC has reported three years of returns. In 2017, the endowment grew by 8.1 percent, which Narvekar called “disappointing” and “a symptom of deep structural problems at HMC.” In 2018, the endowment saw a 10.1 percent return, followed by a more modest growth figure of 6.5 percent in 2019.
Although returns on Harvard’s endowment — the largest of any university in the world — have lagged behind most of its Ivy League peers under Narvekar’s stewardship, experts say it is still too early to tell whether or not this performance is indicative of ineffective strategy at HMC.
Rutgers Business School professor John M. Longo — the Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager for wealth-management firm Beacon Trust — cautioned against using endowment returns alone to judge recent changes at HMC.
“It is true that, given the data, the performance has lagged,” Longo said. “Someone might just look at the numbers and say the performance is lagging, but then you have to say, what kind of risk did they take?”
In his Jan. 2017 letter, Narvekar said that mitigating overall risk was a priority for HMC leadership.
“I should emphasize that our goal is risk-adjusted returns, not simply returns,” he wrote in the letter. “Coming into 2007/2008 there was an arms race among the endowments to take on more and more risk, and many endowments, including Harvard, paid a severe price.”
Longo also emphasized that looking at recent returns is not sufficient evidence to assess Narvekar’s impact.
“Some of these assets are legacy assets which means that they had a long term commitment before Mr. Narvekar took over the portfolio,” Longo said. “You need to kind of give those investments a chance to get out of the portfolio before appropriately measuring the performance.”
The situation is further complicated by the high rate of turnover at the helm of HMC, according to experts. At the time of his hiring, Narvekar was the fourth CEO of HMC in a decade.
Christian T. Lundblad, a professor at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flager Business School, compared the situation to a football coach who is “saddled with whatever players” preceded his or her term.
“If you're gonna fire a coach after three or four or five years, you're almost penalizing them for the previous guys' players and set up,” Lundblad said. “A decent chunk of your portfolio is already governed by whatever preceded you.”
Lundblad said Narvekar has nonetheless made “significant changes” given the constraints of his situation.
Timothy J. Keating ’85, president of Keating Wealth Management, said he believes Narvekar has taken “exactly the right approach” to Harvard’s endowment woes.
“I agree with Narv’s headcount reduction — I assume he's achieved that headcount reduction. I certainly agree with the approach that it makes more sense to look at the endowment as a whole, that's no different from running anything else and a siloed approach creates inefficiencies, so I think everything that Narv has outlined makes conceptual sense,” Keating said. “My question is whether Narv has actually gone far enough.”
Longo also praised the switch from specialized managers to a “generalist” approach.
“It does seem positive that people are incentivized for the performance of the entire fund, so that should result in greater collaboration,” he said. “Having an open environment where everyone sees everything and contributes, in theory, that should be better.”
In October, University President Lawrence S. Bacow told The Crimson he remained “confident” in Narvekar’s five-year plan.
“I think we’re on target for where we’re going to be, but we’ll see,” Bacow said at the time. “Ask me two to three years from now.”

This year’s election for the Board of Overseers — scheduled for April 1 to May 19 — has brought a slate of young alumni campaigning for a chance to compete for a spot on Harvard’s second highest governing body.
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change and recent alumni representation within Harvard’s governance boards — began its campaign in October 2019. The group is campaigning in over 50 cities around the world in its bid to get five recent graduates from Harvard College, Harvard Law School, Harvard Kennedy School, and the Harvard School of Public Health on the ballot.
Though Harvard Forward endorsed its own Overseer candidates in October, Harvard did not nominate any of the group’s endorsed Overseer candidates to the ballot this month. Nevertheless, a candidate can still make it onto the ballot by submitting a petition with 2,936 alumni signatures — one percent of eligible voters — by Feb. 1.
Harvard Forward’s platform argues that the University should divest all assets from fossil fuels, reserve 20 percent of seats on the Board of Overseers for recent graduates, and develop more transparent investment guidelines, according to its website.
The group has also voiced support for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, which is currently negotiating with the University for its first contract after a nearly four-week-long strike in December 2019.
Harvard has repeatedly declined to divest its endowment and all assets from fossil fuels despite increasing calls to do so from students, alumni, and faculty. University President Lawrence S. Bacow and his predecessors have argued that the endowment should not be used for political purposes.
Meet the candidates running to divest Harvard from fossil fuels and increase recent alumni representation on the Board: John E. Beatty ’11, Lisa Bi Huang, Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, Dorothy “Thea” Sebastian ’08, and Jayson U. Toweh.
This year, Divest Harvard — an environmental activist group calling for the University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels — spearheaded prominent protests at the Harvard-Yale football game and the Institute of Politics. However, before Divest Harvard came to be, John E. Beatty ’11 co-founded Harvard’s chapter of a group calling for change, Students for a Just and Stable Future.
The organization — a New England-based student network based in Massachusetts — campaigned for fighting climate change and political inaction in government.
Representatives from a Just and Stable Future visited the State House every Friday throughout the 2011 spring semester to meet with legislators to lobby for their causes, even proposing two bills of their own to phase out coal use in Massachusetts by 2015 and create a task force to develop a plan for generating clean electricity in the state by 2020.
While at the College, Beatty also served on Harvard’s Student Review Committee for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Implementation. The University set a short-term goal in 2008 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2006 to 2016 — a goal it eventually met.
Beatty wrote in a Jan. 22 press release from Harvard Forward that he decided to run for the Board of Overseers because he wants the school to show leadership on climate change and include younger alumni in its governance.
“The university needs to engage more fully with the climate crisis than it has to date,” Beatty wrote. “Increasing young alumni representation on the Board will lead to more conversation about dedicating Harvard’s resources toward climate research and action – because it’s our future that’s at stake.”
Following his graduation from the College in 2011 with a degree in Economics and a secondary in Earth and Planetary Sciences, Beatty worked in investment, focusing on clean energy. He then went on to earn a Masters of Business Administration from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2016. Beatty now works for Amazon as a senior product manager.
Beatty was a signatory on Amazon Employees for Climate Justice’s 2019 public letter to company CEO Jeff Bezos and its Board of Directors. The letter, which includes over 8,700 signatures, urges Amazon to adopt the climate plan shareholder resolution and release a company-wide climate plan.
The first Asian executive vice president of the Kennedy School Student Government, Lisa Bi Huang studied impact investing and social entrepreneurship at the school before graduating in 2019.
During her time at the Kennedy School, Huang co-founded “OZÉ,” which provides management tools for around 10,000 Ghanian small businesses with the hope of facilitating growth and generating employment.
“OZÉ” won Harvard’s Presidential Innovation Challenge in 2018.
Huang said in a Harvard Forward press release that she was drawn to run for the Board of Overseers because of the potential impact the University can have in combating climate change.
“Its students, alumni, and faculty are in many ways already leaders in working to solve the climate crisis, and Harvard has led on other important issues before,” Huang said. “As a mom-to-be, I want my kids to be able to enjoy the same beautiful world that I grew up enjoying.”
“We often used the phrase ‘ask what we can do’ at the Kennedy School, and I believe this is what we can and need to do together,” she added.
Before Harvard, Huang earned bachelor's degrees in economics and journalism at Tsinghua University — one of China’s most selective universities — where she was valedictorian.
Huang’s career has centered on financial technology, venture capital, and impact investing. After working as a senior associate consultant for Bain & Company, she worked for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on impact investing opportunities in healthcare and financial technology for emerging economies such as Ethiopia and China.
During her time at Tsinghua, Huang served as a teaching volunteer in Taiwan, according to her blog. She also participated in debate tournaments and won several national and international awards, according to a Tsinghua University press release.
Huang’s debate instructor, Wenbo Zheng, now an assistant professor at Tsinghua University, said Huang was a “brave” person who “definitely cares about public affairs.”
“She put a lot of effort into things judging from what I know of her previously,” Zheng said. “She will be able to make her contributions.”
At Harvard, Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17 shattered records on the soccer field.
Purce not only led Harvard’s Women Soccer team to two Ivy League Championships, but also became the first athlete in Ivy League History to win both “Rookie of the Year” and “Player of the Year” awards in the same season. She went on to win her second “Player of the Year” award as a senior.
A two-time All-American and semi-finalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy, she was honored with the Radcliffe Prize in 2017 as Harvard's top female student-athlete.
Katherine I. Hess ’20, who played on the Harvard Women’s soccer team at the same time as Purce, said her teammate “led by example.”
“She’s one of those people that you can always learn something from everytime you’re around them,” she said.
Hess recalled a Yale soccer game that she played in alongside Purce on a cold and wet day. Yale was leading 1-0, but with two goals from Harvard — one of which came from Purce, Harvard emerged victorious.
“I just remember knowing that we could [win] because she was on the field, and she was pushing everyone to be their best,” Hess said.
Off the field, Purce participated in the Institute of Politics’s Politics of Race and Ethnicity program. Purce graduated from the College with a degree in Psychology in 2017.
After graduation, Purce was drafted by the former Boston Breakers soccer team with the ninth pick in the 2017 National Women’s Soccer League Draft. After a year with the Breakers, she began playing for the Portland Thorns in Oregon from 2018 to 2019, and was called up to play for the United States National Women’s Team in 2017.
Purce said in a Jan. 22 press release from Harvard Forward that she decided to run for the Board of Overseers because she believes that Harvard can inspire other universities to divest its endowment from fossil fuels if it does so.
“I decided to run for the Board of Overseers because I know that Harvard’s actions can inspire others,” Purce said. “This university is a leader in so many ways, but it hasn’t even agreed to divest from coal and tar sands. Boston, Columbia, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Oregon State, Oxford, Stanford, and the UC and California State University systems are all ahead of Harvard on this. We have a lot of catching up to do before we can call ourselves true climate leaders.”
Dorothy “Thea” L. Sebastian ’08 had a pattern of pioneering projects during her time at the College.
As an undergraduate, she co-founded the Institute of Politics Energy Policy Group and created a magazine focused on female college students.
The Energy Policy Group is part of the larger Institute of Politics’ policy program and is focused on combining policy interests and research to write policy papers for the Massachusetts State Legislature.
Sebastian also launched Freeze Magazine in 2005, which she described in The Crimson in 2007 as a “slightly more academic collegiate oriented version of Cosmopolitan or Seventeen.”
The college lifestyle and fashion publication was based out of the Harvard College Women’s Center and was available for free to students.
In a 2007 interview with The Crimson, Sebastian said she wanted to create a magazine that catered to college students.
“I remember sitting in my dorm with my three roommates, and we were all reading different magazines—‘Cosmo,’ ‘Seventeen,’ ‘Marie Claire,’” she said at the time. “They were all fun to talk about, fun to read, but none of them really addressed the issues of the college student, and I thought, ‘What if I started a magazine that filled that niche?’”
After graduating with a degree in government from the College, Sebastian went on to study at Oxford University where she earned a Masters of Science in Comparative Social Policy, The City University of New York-Hunter College where she earned a Masters in Special Education, and Harvard Law School where she earned a J.D.
She also served as a special education specialist in the South Bronx with Teach for America from 2011 to 2013, according to the press release.
Now based in Washington, D.C., Sebastian works at Civil Rights Corps — a nonprofit aimed at ending systematic injustice within the American criminal legal system — as a policy counsel.
Sebastian wrote in the press release that she is running for the Board of Overseers because she sees climate change as an existential threat.
“People everywhere can now see the climate crisis for the existential threat that it is. Saving our planet isn’t political; it’s rational and necessary,” Sebastian wrote. “As fossil fuels become a losing long-term investment, divestment will ultimately safeguard Harvard’s endowment and its reputation as a global leader.”
Jayson U. Toweh is running for the Board of Overseers to combat how climate change negatively impacts poor and marginalized groups.
“The climate crisis is global now, and it impacts all of us,” Toweh wrote in Harvard Forward’s January press release. “We face unprecedented heat waves; rising sea-levels, stronger hurricanes and more extreme flooding; and more intense wildfires, including those devastating Australia.”
“Many of them strike hardest at the poorest and most marginalized who have done the least to create the crisis, so it’s our duty to fight against this injustice,” he added.
In Toweh’s undergraduate and graduate careers at the University of Michigan and the Harvard School of Public Health, respectively, he engaged with climate-related issues such as environmental protection, sustainability, and renewable energy, according to his Linkedin profile.
In his daily job as a program analyst for the Environmental Protection Agency, Toweh evaluates the effectiveness of responses to water-related issues.
Throughout his career, Toweh approached these climate-related issues from several perspectives.
As an undergraduate in 2015, Toweh founded a student organization on “Sustainable Laundry Practices” that promoted energy-saving recommendations in student laundry rooms, chaired the sustainability commission for the school’s student government, and organized a climate march in Ann Arbor.
“We are calling on our leaders to facilitate a just transition to a hundred percent renewable energy by 2050,” Toweh said in a 2015 promotional video for the climate march.
After graduation, Toweh continued studying the environment and sustainability at the Harvard School of Public Health, where he was involved in clean energy organizations and campus sustainability groups.

To an outsider, working at the Harvard University Police Department is a dream job. Joining the force offers generous benefits, flexible hours, a vibrant work environment, and the opportunity to represent a prestigious institution.
When former Harvard police officer George F. Pierce took a job at the department in 2002, he believed that dream. Born and raised in Cambridge, he said he was proud to enter Harvard’s gates.
Two decades later, Pierce no longer believes serving as a HUPD officer is the perfect assignment. Earlier this month, he retired at 62 years old.
In 2011, Pierce filed a since-settled civil lawsuit against Harvard and the chief of its police department, Francis D. “Bud” Riley, alleging HUPD leadership discriminated against him because he is black. He also filed complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in 2008, 2009, and 2012.
In both the MCAD filings and the suit, Pierce alleged the department denied him promotions and scrutinized his actions because of his race. He also claimed the department retaliated against him for having filed them.
Harvard denied Pierce’s allegations and the parties settled. But he is far from the only HUPD officer to bring complaints against the department.
An investigation by The Crimson found repeated instances of racism and sexism in Harvard’s police department spanning the past 28 years. In MCAD filings, lawsuits, internal documents, meetings with prominent Harvard administrators, and interviews, 21 current and former HUPD employees alleged the department’s leaders have disciplined officers differently because of their race, gender, or personal relationships with the department’s top authority figures. They also identified Riley as the source of what they called a toxic culture in the department.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the specific allegations in this article on behalf of the department and Riley.
“It is the longstanding policy of the Harvard University Police Department not to comment on staffing, equipment, personnel matters, or security measures,” he wrote in an email.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain also declined to comment, writing in an email that the University does not comment on individual personnel matters.
Riley has headed the department since 1996, making him a significantly longer-serving chief than his past two predecessors. Prior to joining HUPD, he worked as a lieutenant colonel for the Massachusetts State Police.
During his quarter-century at Harvard, Riley has burnished his reputation at the University, transitioning the department to a “community policing” model and steering it through scandals. Officers compared the chief to a politician, citing his intelligence and charm — characteristics that have enabled him to cultivate strong relationships across the University.
But while Harvard affiliates see HUPD officers frequenting campus dining halls and helping freshmen move into their dorms, incidents involving female officers and officers of color divide Riley’s force.
Officers interviewed for this article described Riley’s department as an “old boys’ network.” They alleged he rewards members of his inner circle while passing over officers who voice concerns.
For officers distant from the chief, opportunities for upward mobility in the department are slim. Some of those officers have left the department; others have stayed reluctantly, afraid to start their careers anew.
Those officers said their employment at HUPD comes with a professional and emotional cost, and that they believe morale inside the department has never been lower.
Aside from Pierce, three other officers have filed lawsuits over the past two decades against Riley and Harvard alleging discrimination. Five officers have filed complaints against Riley and the University with MCAD. All of these officers agreed to confidential settlements with Harvard.
Still others alleged Riley has discriminated against them, too, but said they were reluctant to litigate their grievances because they thought they could not afford to face Harvard in court.
Current and former members of the department shared their experiences working as Harvard police officers with The Crimson under the condition of anonymity because they said they feared retaliation from Riley. Retired officers said the same, adding that they are trying to put their time at Harvard behind them.
Last September, HUPD suspended Josiah Christian, a black officer, for one week without pay after he and a white officer named Thomas F. Karns had a physical altercation. The two fought after Karns allegedly used homophobic and racist slurs, calling Christian a “f----t n----r.” The altercation occurred roughly four years ago in HUPD’s parking lot, but was only brought to department leaders last year. Catalano declined to comment on Karns’s behalf.
Officers said Karns’s comments were only the most recent of several racist remarks and incidents in the department — some of which involved prominent HUPD officials.
Roughly two years ago, a white officer named Stephen T. O’Connor called a black officer a “monkey.” O’Connor chose to resign following the incident after the department gave him the choice to do so or face termination.
O’Connor declined to comment on the situation, deferring to Harvard University Police Association president Michael J. Allen, who declined to comment for this article.
Roughly five years ago, a white officer named Thomas J. Hoey showed black officers a photo of himself in blackface taken at Halloween earlier that year. According to officers familiar with the situation, the department suspended Hoey for several days in response — a punishment some officers viewed as light compared to Christian’s recent suspension.
Catalano said the department investigates all violations of HUPD policy once it becomes aware of them. A report is then presented to the chief, who decides the specific terms of discipline on a case-by-case basis.
Pierce also alleged in his 2011 lawsuit that officers in the department made explicitly racist remarks.
“Supervisory officers in the Department have routinely made openly racial remarks, including complaining that ‘n-----s’ had ‘taken over’ baseball and basketball, in the context of questioning why the Department ‘had’ to hire more ‘n-----s’; making statements such as ‘I hate blacks’ and comments about ‘ch-nk’ food; and referring to a Latino officer as a ‘sp-c’,” the complaint reads.
Harvard and Riley’s lawyers contested Pierce’s allegations, arguing that any claims made based on these facts were “time-barred as a matter of law,” according to the defendants’ answer to Pierce’s second complaint.
The defense admitted that an officer addressed another officer as a “sp-c,” but disputed the remark’s context.
“Further answering, the allegation regarding the use of the word “sp-c” is taken out of context, as it was used in a manner than was intended to be sarcastic rather than offensive, although the employee that used the word was nevertheless appropriately counseled,” the document reads.
In his suit, Pierce described HUPD as having “created and maintained a pervasive racially-biased environment within the Department, supported by management, including top management.”
People of color comprise roughly twenty-six percent of the department’s patrol officers and detectives, according to Catalano. They comprise only nine percent of the department’s sworn leadership, according to data from HUPD’s online directory.
Some officers of color said they feel alienated as a result of the disparity. They also said they believe officers who used racial slurs faced insufficient discipline.
Still, HUPD has taken steps to promote diversity and inclusion under Riley, according to Catalano and Title IX Coordinator for Harvard Human Resources and HUPD Maria Mejia.
“The Harvard University Police Department is committed to hiring and maintaining a diverse workforce, both civilians and sworn, and is constantly looking to hire the most qualified, diverse workforce available,” Catalano said.
Mejia said HUPD began a new recruitment process to increase the representation of racial minorities and women in the department during Riley’s tenure. These efforts, she said, include targeting recruitment efforts toward minorities and interviewing all minority applicants who meet minimum qualifications.
A 2009 report that assessed HUPD’s interactions with Harvard affiliates also argued the department had made progress recruiting minority officers.
“HUPD has increased the percentage of minorities in HUPD from 10% in 1998 to 19% in 2008,” the report reads.
The department has also mandated that officers attend diversity training, but several officers said they felt the training was ineffective and that the department’s leadership did not take it seriously.
In his 2008 MCAD charge, his second amended complaint in his lawsuit, and an interview, Pierce recalled a remark deputy chief Kevin Regan made during a department diversity training program. Pierce said Regan criticized a black state trooper for filing a race-based discrimination complaint, rather than, in Regan’s words, “settling this like a man.”
Harvard and Riley denied Pierce’s allegation, according to their answer to his complaint.
In 2008, Riley created a new position in the department, called the diversity and community liaison officer, in an effort to improve the department’s relationship with Harvard affiliates. Riley appointed sergeant Kevin P. Bryant — the only black officer currently in the department’s leadership — to fill the post.
Since Riley became chief 24 years ago, only four women have been promoted to leadership positions in the department. Nineteen percent of HUPD officers and detectives are female, according to Catalano. Women are less represented among sworn leadership, which boasts just one female officer.
Several female officers have said they faced discrimination while on the job at HUPD.
They said leadership passes them over for promotions because of their gender and holds them to higher standards than their male counterparts.
At least five female officers have brought concerns about gender discrimination to University officials and police union leaders, filed complaints with MCAD, or sued Harvard over the past three decades.
In 1992, four years before Riley became chief, then-HUPD sergeant Kathleen Stanford filed a complaint with MCAD alleging that the department discriminated against her on the basis of gender by denying her promotions and paying her less than male officers who shared her rank. The commission found probable cause to credit her allegations, and the University and Stanford agreed to settle the complaint, after which she withdrew it.
In 1999, Stanford filed a lawsuit against Riley and Harvard. Stanford alleged that Riley discriminated against her on the basis of gender and retaliated against her for speaking out about perceived mistreatment, though some allegations in her suit predated Riley’s arrival.
Separately, she filed an affidavit with the Cambridge Human Rights Commission.
Stanford wrote in the affidavit and the suit that Riley harassed her by personally making disparaging and sexist remarks about her and unfairly scrutinizing her work.
“Since Chief Riley was hired in January 1996, he has subjected me to an ongoing campaign of harassment to which male co-workers have not been subjected,” Stanford wrote in the affidavit.
She alleged the harassment included “derogatory, disparaging, or demeaning comments about women in front of [her] and other female employees of HUPD; frequent unfounded accusations, frequently made in an extremely hostile and physically threatening manner, that [Stanford] had violated HUPD policy; and frequent comments wrongly implying that [she] was an unproductive employee and questioning [her] competence and professionalism.”
Affidavits submitted to the Human Rights Commission by five HUPD employees on Stanford’s behalf described the department as hostile toward women. The officers testified to Stanford’s superior qualifications compared to men who received promotions and wrote about the intense scrutiny she faced from Riley. They wrote that the department disciplined Stanford for small infractions that typically went unnoticed by the department when committed by other officers. In three affidavits submitted by female employees, they shared personal anecdotes of sexism allegedly perpetrated by Riley.
Riley and the University’s lawyers both denied in court that he had subjected Stanford to gender-based discrimination and retaliation, according to the defendants’ answers to her lawsuit. The defense also denied Stanford’s allegations that Riley harassed her, specifically that Riley made demeaning and threatening comments to her and that he frequently questioned her professional ability.
Stanford eventually reached a confidential settlement with the University. She was not the last female officer to allege gender discrimination in the department.
On Jan. 8 of this year, HUPD terminated female officer Corina F. Maher, who had sustained an ear injury resulting from sergeant Charles P. Hanson’s negligent firing of his weapon next to her at a HUPD gun range.
On August 13, 2018, Hanson, who is also a range instructor, violated department safety protocols while training Maher. An internally available incident report written by Maher and obtained by The Crimson states that Hanson negligently fired a live round of ammunition using his real gun in a simulation room where officers are only allowed to use imitation weapons.
Hanson fired his gun while standing adjacent to Maher, who was not wearing safety equipment because live weapons are forbidden per range safety procedures. With no protective gear to shield her, Maher sustained an ear injury that ultimately rendered her unable to work, according to four officers familiar with the situation.
Charles Chalmers, another officer present at the range, told Maher she could leave the scene shortly after the incident, according to the incident report, a detailed account of an event written from the perspective of an officer present and available to all officers in the department.
“Officer Chalmers told me a call was placed by Sergeant Hanson to Deputy Regan and I was informed I could leave and go home,” Maher wrote in the report.
Several officers familiar with the situation said they believed the department did not adequately investigate the negligent firing. Specifically, they called it highly unusual that Maher went home before receiving a medical evaluation or writing an incident report.
In the report, Maher alleged that Chalmers later pressured her to stay quiet about the incident. He “advised not telling anyone about it as it would likely be a cause for gossip/embarrassment,” she wrote.
Maher wrote that she did not discuss the incident for eight months, hoping her symptoms would subside. She continued to experience medical issues over the ensuing months, however. On April 30, 2019, Maher confided in HUPD sergeant Jacobo Negron, who told her to write the report detailing the range incident and its effects on her, according to an incident report Negron wrote.
Officers said they believed the department’s leadership attempted to quiet discussions of the incident partially to protect Hanson. They said Hanson is a member of the chief’s inner circle and also belongs to the same law enforcement motorcycle club, Road Dawgs, as Regan.
Officers familiar with the gun range incident also charged that the department did not thoroughly investigate the incident because Maher is a woman.
When Harvard fired Maher, several officers said the University invoked its right to terminate an employee who has been out on medical leave for at least six months. Five officers said that in recent years, the department did not terminate several male officers who had been out on medical leave for longer than six months.
Mejia said the University’s central human resources office, not the department, makes ultimate decisions regarding whether to enforce the six-month guideline. She said Harvard determines whether or not to invoke the policy on a case-by-case basis.
“[It] depends on a gamut of issues, including staffing and operational needs at the time or uncertainty of return to work,” she said.
To some female officers, Maher’s last months in the department are evidence of HUPD leadership’s broader disregard for female officers’ concerns.
Asked to describe female officers’ experiences at HUPD, one female officer compared her time at the department to being in an abusive relationship.
“No matter what we do, we have to keep taking it, and keep taking it, and keep taking it, because at the end of the day, we need to pay the bills,” she said.
“I often feel that we are at HUPD just so they can check the Equal Opportunity box. I feel that we are not recognized for our daily contribution and our ability to do the job.”
Officers interviewed for this story said incidents of discrimination at HUPD rarely happen in a vacuum — they alleged that the department’s broader culture under Riley has enabled discriminatory behavior to persist. Riley maintains a system of promoting and rewarding officers who he deems trustworthy, they said, and shuns HUPD employees who raise concerns about racism and sexism.
In his early years as chief, Riley enacted a series of changes in the department. Officers critical of those changes alleged that they enabled Riley to consolidate power and hire a staff that would be primarily loyal to him.
He axed the lieutenant position — held by six veteran officers — on May 5, 1999 and dismissed them, according to two suits filed by former lieutenants against Riley and Harvard. Riley also hired officers with connections to the state police, his former workplace. Riley also discontinued standardized tests previously used in the department’s promotion process.
Current and former officers alleged that Riley’s changes allowed him to wield greater control over hiring decisions.
“Chief Riley’s failure to consider the exam scores for the promotions to lieutenant allowed him to make a biased discriminatory decision on the promotions,” Stanford’s 1999 complaint states. The department denied Stanford’s allegation.
Catalano disagreed with officers’ characterization of the change. He said Riley altered the process to include greater feedback, including an interview component conducted by Harvard faculty or resident deans.
Two of the lieutenants that Riley fired in 1999, John F. Rooney and Edward Sheridan, seperately sued Riley and Harvard in 2001 for employment discrimination. In their suits, they alleged that the chief retaliated against them for providing affidavits on behalf of Stanford, who was their colleague.
Both plaintiffs reached confidential settlements with the University.
In a Wednesday interview, Riley said his decision to eliminate the lieutenant position was unrelated to loyalty.
Riley said that he arrived at HUPD to find a rift between the police force and Harvard students, faculty, and staff. He transitioned HUPD into a community policing law enforcement agency in order to heal that rift, he said. Members of the department who resisted this change, he alleged, included some officers who held the rank of lieutenant.
When Riley joined the department as chief, he brought in Regan, a fellow former state trooper, as his deputy chief. Many officers described Regan as Riley’s right-hand man and said he is prone to loud outbursts that frequently intimidate dissenting officers.
Officers said building a rapport with Regan pays dividends in the department. They called people who benefit from these perks “Friends of Kevin” or F.O.K.
One former officer, who said he was a mutual friend of Regan, told The Crimson that in 2007, Regan fed him the questions and answers to an interview with members of the department ahead of time to help him secure a job at HUPD. The former officer said that he had no previous experience in law enforcement before he arrived at Harvard.
Catalano declined to comment on the former officer’s allegation, citing department policy.
Other officers complained that Riley and other department leaders dispense benefits to favored officers.
Several officers said Riley grants favored deputies the privilege of using “take-home” cars, which come with Harvard-funded gas cards and insurance.
Four officers confirmed that the department has roughly 20 take-home vehicles. By comparison, MIT Police has just one and Northeastern University Police Department has two. Under the previous HUPD chief, the department had fewer than five take-home cars, according to officers familiar with the situation.
Officers said several HUPD employees use take-home cars primarily because of their relationship with the chief.
In the past, the department’s alleged misuse of take home vehicles has been the subject of public controversy. The Crimson reported in 2009 that Harvard auditors launched an investigation into alleged vehicle misuse in the department.
University employees said at the time that Riley inappropriately used his car for a weekend trip to Vermont, paying for gas using a Harvard-issued card, according to the article.
Regan took his HUPD vehicle on a personal trip to a motorcycle rally in South Dakota in 2007 and used his Harvard-issued card to pay for gas, according to officers familiar with the situation and a photograph from the trip.
Despite some officers’ criticisms, one former sergeant said he understands the changes Riley made in the department.
He said he believes Riley favored hiring state troopers because he trusted them. And he alleged that Riley disciplined dissenting officer, not out of retaliation, but because they frequently failed to execute orders.
While Pierce was still with the department, he said he felt demoralized working under Riley’s system of hirings, promotions, and firings.
“I'm not going to apply for anything ever again, because I know I'm not gonna get it. So I'm fine doing what I'm doing. Come to work, do my overtime, and go home and spend it with my family, which is the most important thing to me,” he said. “It sets a bad taste in your mouth.”
The department’s problems under Riley — whether they are related to favoritism, race, or gender — have not gone unnoticed by Harvard’s administration.
The University has commissioned three reviews of HUPD during Riley’s tenure. In 1999, George L. Kelling, a criminologist and research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, examined the department and detailed his findings in a 51-page review. In 2008, Harvard Director of Human Resources Ann Dexter wrote a report about the department, and one year later former Suffolk County district attorney Ralph C. Martin II investigated HUPD’s policing of Harvard’s campus at the request of former University President Drew G. Faust.
In his report, entitled “The Harvard University Police Department: A Strategic Analysis,” Kelling wrote about employees’ criticisms of Riley.
“Chief Riley Is Turning the HUPD into a State Police Annex” one bullet point in the report read. Kelling also mentioned that officers felt disillusioned by the chief’s alleged showing of favoritism.
Kelling went on to dismiss the latter criticism, writing in the report that divisions in the department predated Riley. He added that he believed Riley had to make significant changes to HUPD to achieve his vision, and that officers’ dissatisfaction with the chief stemmed from their reluctance to change.
Though Kelling disputed some officers’ allegations, he mentioned significant conflicts between officers and Riley.
“It is no secret that HUPD has troubles: morale is bad for some in the department and conflict exists between the chief and some mid-managers,” Kelling wrote. “[Riley] is a bit of a character.”
Many HUPD employees interviewed said administrators outside of the department have long been aware of officers’ concerns about Riley but have failed to take adequate action.
On several occasions, officers have brought their concerns directly to top Harvard officials.
Last fall, Pierce said he met with Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and told her about racist incidents in the department and its lack of diversity. He also met with Senior Advisor to the President John S. Wilson to discuss diversity in the department, according to emails obtained by The Crimson.
Wilson also met with Riley and Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp regarding “climate issues” at HUPD, according to an email.
Several officers said that they have met with ombudsman Lydia L. Cummings to tell her about their grievances with the department.
Lapp wrote in an emailed response to HUPD officers’ allegations that she believes the department and Riley play a vital role on campus.
“The public safety role of the HUPD is fundamental to ensuring Harvard is a place where every member of our community can do their best and be their best, and it’s a role I know every HUPD officer takes seriously,” she wrote. “Chief Riley’s continued leadership in community policing and engagement, along with diversity in recruiting and investment in the professionalism of the department, reflects his belief that his organization, like any organization, can do better and he is committed to doing just that.”
After more than two decades of meetings, lawsuits, and University reports, however, officers said they are skeptical that the situation in the department will ever improve.
Pierce said the discrimination he says he faced at HUPD marred a career he otherwise loved.
“You didn't know if you were going to be held accountable for something, judged, scrutinized on reports, or scrutinized on your interaction with the community,” he said. “I pride myself on being a positive role model for the community. A compassionate person with the students, the staff, faculty, citizens, the public. I prided myself on that. And I don't think you get much recognition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding an eight-game win streak, including six in a row on the road, the Crimson (13-4, 2-0 Ivy) will visit the Quakers (7-8, 0-2 Ivy) on Friday and the Tigers (8-7, 2-0) on Saturday as it continues its five-game road trip and looks to stay undefeated in conference play.
Despite having momentum on its side, coming away with two road victories will still be a formidable task. Harvard will have to contend with the unexpected adversity of Ivy League play while continuing to have a balanced scoring attack and a stalwart defense.
“In conference play, it’s always difficult and more competitive,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “It has a way of having a different gear and energy about it. You know you're so familiar with one another and the games are always close and hard-fought.”
In its most recent games, the Crimson had difficulty closing out its opponents. In both of its games against Ancient Eight rival Dartmouth, the team almost blew a double-digit lead in the second half. Playing consistently for a full forty minutes will be crucial towards maintaining leads in hostile environments like the Palestra and Jadwin Gym.
“We’re just trying to build towards a complete 40,” senior guard Christian Juzang said. “I think that’s kind of what the Ivy League is all about, especially as we’re getting closer to the tournament. I think we’ve had some trouble closing games recently, but that last final stretch of four minutes—it’s something we’re definitely working on. We’re building off our last game and just hoping to play better basketball.”
Juzang and the other members of the team have had to elevate their play in the absence of senior guard Bryce Aiken and senior forward Seth Towns. Aiken looks to be dealing with an injured ankle, so Juzang will once again have to step up and be the team’s lead guard during its road trip this weekend.
“Christian has been as valuable as any kid we've had a program for the last two years,” Amaker said. “You know he's been able to step in at various moments; we just love what he’s done. His spirit has always been intact.”
While it will be important for the Crimson’s playmakers to continue its balanced scoring attack, defeating Penn will require a strong defensive presence on the inside and the perimeter. The Quakers have a slew of versatile bigs led by senior forward AJ Brodeur who has averaged 17.2 points and 9.1 rebounds a game for the season. First-year guard Jordan Dingle also provides Penn with an outside scoring presence with 14.7 points a game.
“With [the strength of] Brodeur in the middle of the paint and their center as their post guy, they’re just as good as anybody in our league up front, and they have talent on the perimeter as well,” Amaker said. “The quickness they have with that kid Dingle, you know as a freshman has been key to their team.”
Princeton also poses its own challenges for Harvard, coming into its game against the Crimson with a hot streak of its own, having won its last four contests by an average of 18.5 points. Led by the combined 28.5 points of sophomore guard Jaelin Llewellyn and senior center Richmond Aririguzoh, the Tigers have had one of the most efficient offenses in the Ivy League, scoring on 46% of their baskets, and look to stay undefeated in the Ancient Eight by defending their home court.
To maintain its win streak, and assert itself as a conference threat, the Crimson will have to rely on the experience of its seasoned veterans. The senior leadership on this team has played a pivotal role in turning the team’s fortunes around following a 5-4 start to the season.
“We’re all really aligned this year,” senior forward Justin Bassey says. “We all have one goal; we’re all willing to sacrifice. Whether it’s minutes, playing time, or time off the court. Everyone’s all in. Our senior leadership has been phenomenal this year starting with Henry and Seth, but all of our guys have taken a step up, and that’s manifested itself in our most recent win streak. We’ve been playing some of our best basketball in four years.”
The seniors on this team have been trying to win the league and make it to the NCAA tournament for four years. They hope to continue their journey with this road and take one more step to the glory they’ve been waiting for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SCHENECTADY, N.Y. — After the first frame in Friday’s bout against Union, the Harvard men’s hockey team was trailing by a score. After another 20 minutes, the No. 16 Crimson was ahead by four.
A six-goal second period is to thank for completely reversing the course of the game. Harvard (10-6-4, 8-4-3 ECAC) and its scorching offense routed the Dutchmen (6-18-3, 4-10-1) by a final tally of 8-5 in its sole challenge of the weekend ahead of Monday’s Beanpot Tournament.
“I have a lot of respect for this program,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 of Union. “After the first, we needed a response, and I thought that we had to raise our compete level if we wanted to be able to hold onto pucks and play offense. Nice getting some goals from other lines than the first.”
Due to a strong response to open the middle stanza, the Crimson regained both the lead and momentum after a first period that left something to be desired. This abrupt turnaround defined Friday’s affair, as Union never sniffed a tie game — much less a win — thereafter.
For Harvard, once the second-period goals started, they seemingly never stopped. The visitors put in three before the midway point of the frame, quickly padding the advantage they opened up just minutes before. On the third tuck, sophomore blue-liner Marshall Rifai ripped a drop pass from classmate and forward Jack Drury, dazzling with a pinpoint snipe for his first collegiate score.
“He’s my roommate, so I’ve been listening to him talk about trying to get the first one for a long time,” said Drury of Rifai, with a grin. “Everyone was really excited. He’s a really good guy in the locker room, a huge piece of our team in terms of our character and our identity.”
Harvard cashed in another three times in the back half of the frame, including two goals by members of the top forward line. In total, Drury, sophomore Casey Dornbach, and freshman Nick Abruzzese finished with 12 points on Friday evening, showcasing the skill level that has earned each of them the status of a better-than-point-per-game scorer this season.
These dynamic skaters accounted for all three of their team’s powerplay conversions, making Friday another successful night for the Crimson man-up unit, which paces the nation at 30.7 percent effective.
“As we were able to kind of open up the game and get on the powerplay, some of our top guys made some high-end, skilled plays,” coach Donato said.
Abruzzese’s first of two notches with the extra attacker, in which a cross-crease pass resulted in a Union own-goal, proved to be the game-winner. He followed up with another goal, this time 5-on-3, before Drury found pay dirt for his second.
Harvard did not let up after its overwhelming second period, which resulted in a goalie swap for the Dutchmen, chipping in an additional two goals in the third. Union was able to find twine as well, preserving some semblance of respectability with one strike at the very end of the second and another three in the final stanza.
“There’s a little bit of a lapse in intensity on your side because you feel comfortable with the lead, but the last thing you want to do is sit on a lead at any point in the game,” Abruzzese said. “That’s something we can learn from moving forward: keep the intensity level high and keep playing on our toes, keep attacking the other team no matter the score of the game.”
A relatively uneventful first period found some life late in the frame. Three minutes before the intermission, Union senior Vas Kolias threw a pass from the point down to the goal mouth, where freshman defenseman Dylan Anhorn redirected it. The puck squeaked through the legs of goaltender Mitchell Gibson, and Anhorn followed his initial chance by punching it home.
The Dutchmen had controlled play several shifts before Anhorn’s fourth of the year and continued to carry the action through the end of the period. The Crimson’s comeback abruptly halted what initially appeared to be a surge in momentum for the home team.
“We came in after [the first] period, and the coach emphasized that we had to get more guys to the net,” Drury said. “We’ve talked a lot about momentum throughout the year, and how to manage it…. I think today was a good example of [the importance of] that.”
Friday’s capture of two precious ECAC points marks the first time Harvard has left Frank L. Messa Rink with a victory since Jan. 2010. A team effort made this possible, as all four forward lines contributed goals.
In the second period, junior forward Henry Bowlby redirected a point shot five-hole. Thirty seconds later, sophomore forward R.J. Murphy beat Union goaltender Darion Hanson (5 GA, .773 SV%) top-right with a rocket in transition. The Crimson’s fifth goal of the stanza came courtesy of sophomore center Baker Shore, whose gritty net-front presence paid off.
“When we have all four lines going, that’s kind of the standard for us,” Drury said. “That can lead to creating a lot of offensive chances.”
In addition to a two-goal, two-assist night from both Drury and Abruzzese, Dornbach played the role of facilitator with four helpers. On the blue line, rookie Henry Thrun pocketed three assists, and junior Reilly Walsh and sophomore Jack Rathbone pitched in two apiece.
Rathbone made his return to the lineup after a three-game absence due to a shoulder injury sustained in mid-January’s triumph over St. Lawrence. The Vancouver Canucks prospect, who ranks in the top five in per-game scoring among Division-I defensemen (1.06), wasted no time getting back on the scoresheet.
Despite nabbing the win, Gibson (5 GA, .839 SV%) left the door open for senior Cameron Gornet to receive the nod in the upcoming Beanpot clash with Northeastern. While coach Donato did not comment on the matter, the battle for the starting crease remains a noteworthy storyline ahead of Monday evening.
That night, a much more formidable foe will be staring down Harvard at TD Garden — a prime opportunity for the Crimson to pick up a statement win over a ranked opponent.
