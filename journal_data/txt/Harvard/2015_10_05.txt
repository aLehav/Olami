After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, public policy think tank Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth, also known as MassINC, released a study that highlights the racial and ethnic disparities in Massachusetts’ jail population. The study found that black defendants awaiting trial are greatly overrepresented in some areas of the state, attributable, in part, to far higher average bail amounts. This speaks to a larger trend of racial disparity in incarceration in Massachusetts. Though the state has one of the lowest overall incarceration rates in the country, the numbers for black residents are closer to the national average and relatively high for Latinos.
The study and its results stand as an indictment of the way the criminal justice system works in Massachusetts and across the nation, where too many people, and especially people of color are funneled into a broken prison system. Luckily, the Commonwealth has a readily available way to improve its problem: Legislation currently before the House would introduce risk assessment tools to promote a fairer pretrial process.
Imprisoning those who have yet to face a judge only perpetuates unfavorable circumstances. Approximately half a million people on any given day sit in jail due to their inability to pay bail. Setting a high cash bail amount that the pretrial detainees are unlikely to afford is unnecessary and detrimental: Awaiting trial in jail is disadvantageous to the defendant and can lead to loss of unemployment, housing, and social support.
Moreover, in Massachusetts, few of the factors currently used in setting bail have been shown to have any correlation with the risk of flight, and many characteristics that are linked to that risk are not considered. The state also does not utilize a risk assessment process to determine cash bail amounts, unlike the federal courts and other parts of the nation. The pending legislation would fix these issues.
Reducing bail would also lead to lower costs for the state by reducing the economic burden of pretrial imprisonment. In some parts of the state, the variable cost per bed is nearly $6,000 annually; the additional fixed savings generated by reducing cell numbers would further lower costs.
Attempts have been made to shape a fairer pretrial process in other parts of the country. In Washington, D.C., for example, almost 88 percent of pretrial detainees are released non-financially, to great success: Nearly all released defendants attend their scheduled court appearances and very few are arrested again with new charges. This system is a model that Massachusetts should consider following.
As it stands, Massachusetts’ criminal justice system plagues minorities and the poor, at great cost to the state. Reforming the way the Commonwealth handles pretrial detainees could also help diminish racial and ethnic disparities in Massachusetts and the nation. It is time to truly treat all citizens—regardless of color or income—as innocent until proven guilty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was slightly breathless from the climb, but it was my first time on the observatory rooftop and my first time watching an eclipse. The horizon was lined by lights: the beaming Boston skyline to the right, Harvard’s bell towers in the center, the span of twinkling suburbs to the left. It was unbelievable to be here—here at Harvard.
The warmth of new and old friends around me made me realize just how comfortable I had grown, how comfortable I finally felt in my own skin.
In between the mooncakes, random singing, and freshman-girl laughs, one friend broke into the present with a real fantasy: “Did you know that the next time we see this blood moon we’ll be 36? Thirty six! We’ll be so old.”
Her excitement pulled me into the air, and for a moment I could see two of me—me in the present and me in the future. It was the same red moon, the same enchantment, the same autumn excitement. But the future me was established, mature, and fulfilled. The dreams I dream were materializing.
“If you’re rich, you have to rent out one of those penthouses on the 30th floor in Manhattan and throw the most elaborate party you can imagine,” my friend continued. “I’ll make sure you have mooncakes made by the best chef in the world and super elitist champagne.” I laughed at the idea. It’d be very unlikely for me to run into that kind of wealth in the public service sector, but who knows? Anything in the future is possible.
But when the rust red had faded and homework had regained its throne, a lurking thought from the past rematerialized. What if I don’t see the future? What if I don’t see the next blood moon?
I feel happy and alive right now, but how many Januarys, Februarys, Marchs, Aprils, and Mays had I spent unable to remember what normal felt like? Those winters where attempts to make myself happy only made me more miserable haven’t completely faded. I haven’t forgotten how it feels when apathy grinds your personality away. I had felt so alone. It was as though the people around me were only ghosts who had to be fed “happiness.”
Sometimes the only thing keeping me alive was my inability to logically justify killing myself. But if a truck ever sped towards me, I don’t know if I would have tried to run.
Jump back to the second week of freshman year. It’s a Monday night and there’s homework, but for some reason there’s also extended orientation. The subject is mental illness, which seems to matter to me alone. I optimistically dismiss the complaints around me as only a social thing. Surely, at Harvard, people know what depression means.
But the discussion doesn’t pick up. People don’t even try to understand the three case studies as relevant to them too. I watch repeatedly as the single excuse “I don’t know how” erases all obligation for human kindness. Nick is missing classes and there are bandages on his arms? Don’t press, you don’t want to ruin the friendship. Someone is at war with themselves? Don’t confront them, that’s awkward. For a school that is supposed to be diverse and creative, it’s pitiful that deadly inaction and confrontation are the only choices.
But they aren’t. In fact, they’re probably the only two wrong ones. The problem with confrontation is that it makes someone feel as though they are a problem. They are flawed and now have to be “corrected.” If that doesn’t make you feel angry, it makes you feel guilty. Confrontation should only ever used in the most stubborn cases, cases where failure to get that person help will have awful consequences.
But, most of the time, confrontation doesn’t even have the chance to happen. Every time I fall under, I find myself searching keenly for someone who will notice the depression leaking from my smile as though my life depended on it. And sometimes my life did. The almost comical thing is that over all these long winters, no one ever saw. And the less people noticed, the harder I tried to hide. I became a master of faking the vital signs of life. Meanwhile, alI I needed was just one person to discover my secret and care enough to break the spell.
If you ever find yourself waving that flimsy sheet of counseling resources in front of my face, you should probably just let me make the jump. What I really wanted was your friendship, your conversation, your concern, your jokes, your validation, your inborn ability to make me feel as though I actually matter. Right now this form of casual, healing kindness feels rarer than a blood moon. But maybe you will notice. Maybe after reading this you won’t be scared to give me that extra inch of ground to walk on. And maybe I’ll see the next blood moon.

It’s a luxury to indulge in the visceral—and I suggest that you and I take advantage of it while we can. I hope you, as I did, saw the breaking news update on the Umpqua Community College shooting, read a few early takes on it, and sat there in front of your computer, senselessly—your lower jaw hanging open in a soundless scream. I hope you questioned your most deeply held beliefs about gun control, about your politics in general. And I hope while the blood of those nine victims cooled, yours boiled.
I hope all this because we can afford to do it: As much as we like to think otherwise, a college education—Harvard, no less—is rightfully an inquiry into Platonics. We engage hypotheticals, and strive for the ideal. When we do talk about something concrete, like public policy or a cultural practice, we’re encouraged to pay little heed to those pesky limits of plausibility. We factor out the real world.
But in a blink of an eye, we become a part of it.
There will come a time soon after we graduate when many of us reach a political ascendancy where our thoughts will matter in earnest—where the imperative to just “do something” will require us to elaborate and put forth an agenda of what to do exactly. This will necessitate rational thinking that above all appreciates that policy issues are immutably complex.
And while we don’t have to think about this yet, the current players in our political landscape can’t afford to have their heads in a cloud. If our reductionist national response to the Oregon shooting is any indication, though, their heads aren’t coming down anytime soon.
A mass shooting like this one has, right on cue, inspired unproductive rhetoric that seems to suggest that the solution to gun violence has been under our noses all along. Unbelievably, in his official statement, President Obama first admitted, “We don’t yet know why this individual did what he did,” but then prescribed “common-sense gun legislation” without entailing what this magic antidote would be.
It’s sad that this must even be pointed out explicitly, but for the sake of not being misinterpreted: The goal of both proponents and critics of gun regulation is to reduce mass shootings. Only one side, though, is willing to admit that it will take more than common sense. The other will likely bumble around for a few minutes before admitting to not having any proposals when asked: “With [all due] respect, what is your plan?”
A fair policy debate emerging in the aftermath of this tragedy should take the mens rea of the perpetrator seriously (as it should the state of mental health in this nation altogether). It should also be founded on the fact that gun control in a nation with 300 million firearms and a well-established gun culture necessitates different methods than gun control in a country with a fraction of this number. It will then examine how criminals don’t acquire guns in the way most Americans do, how shooters evade tough background checks, and how mass shootings account for a small fraction of gun violence in this country. Once we lay the cards on the table, then we can get somewhere beyond empty impulses to do something about the problem. Then we can strive for the ideal.
I too am angry about the tragedy that unfolded in Oregon, and I too want to find solutions to a problem that keeps surfacing too many times to merit inaction. But if I were a betting man, I’d put my money on leaders who understand the complexity of the American gun problem and can separate their policy ideas from their visceral reactions, rather than on leaders who chalk it all up to a dearth of common sense.

Harvard students joined a crowd of more than 20,000 people in cheers and calls for “political revolution” in Boston on Saturday as Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addressed supporters.
“When we heard about this rally, we sort of realized we had to do something. It was too good of an opportunity to pass up,” said Justin G. Curtis ’19, the secretary of Harvard United for Bernie, a group of Sanders backers who organized students’ trip to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. “It’s a great opportunity to get people excited about Bernie who haven’t heard about him, or to consolidate support if they have.”
According to its members, Harvard United for Bernie is a growing student organization founded by a group of College juniors and seniors last spring in attempts to increase support for Sanders on campus and in the greater Boston area through partnerships with other local universities. The group led more than 75 Harvard students to the rally, cheering “Harvard United for Bernie!” and bearing pins, stickers, and handmade T-shirts. 

“I’m eager to latch onto the enthusiasm of a genuine movement,” Ben P. Delsman ’19 said. “I think that there’s a buzz of authenticity surrounding Bernie’s campaign.”
Eduardo S. Cabral ’16, another supporter, joked that he wanted to go to the rally to see if he could lip sync Sanders’s speech because he had listened to the candidate’s previous ones multiple times.
“I realize how much of a fight this is going to be if he’s to become president. By coming to these rallies, by helping swell the numbers, we can increase his visibility,” Cabral said.
Although former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton is still widely considered the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2016 presidential election, Sanders continues to attract large crowds. The self-described democratic socialist has gained support among young people in particular.
Kai M. Mateo ’18, Harvard United for Bernie’s communications and outreach director, said he was not surprised at the large turnout of local college students at the Boston event this weekend.
“A lot of these issues really resonate with college students who are politically aware—things like working on income inequality, reforming healthcare, working to reform campaign finance ... and of course making higher education more accessible and more affordable for all Americans,” Mateo said.
Following speeches by Sanders’s national press secretary, a local nurse, a local transit union leader, a climate change activist, and a University of Massachusetts student, Sanders took the stage on Saturday. He spoke about issues of socioeconomic, racial, and gender disparities, high college tuition costs, police brutality, racial profiling, climate change, and foreign policy.
Attendees booed statistics on unemployment and incarceration rates and cheered Sanders’s proposals to invest in jobs and education, raise the minimum wage, and close the gender pay gap. After Sanders thanked attendees and welcomed them to “the political revolution,” the audience erupted in applause.
“It really was absolutely amazing,” Gabe S. Coonce ’19 said. “I’m from a tiny town in the Midwest. It’s extremely conservative, and this is completely unlike everything I’ve ever seen.”
Still, some students saw room for improvement. While Cabral found the rally “really phenomenal” overall, he said he was disappointed with what he perceived as the lack of diversity in the crowd.
“[Sanders] needs to not just rely on progressive white liberals to bring him to victory,” Cabral said. “I hope his campaign starts working harder on mobilizing African American voters and Latino voters.”
Mateo said he was pleased with the turnout of Harvard students at the rally. Harvard United for Bernie will launch phone banking and canvassing campaigns in the months leading up to the primary election, he added.

Ancient Mayan teeth and a mummified crocodile were among the artifacts featured at the Peabody Museum’s Amazing Archaeology Fair on Saturday. Harvard undergraduates and graduate students presented many of the exhibits at the annual event, which was held in partnership with the Harvard Semitic Museum.
“The goal is to share Harvard knowledge and expertise with the general public and to excite people about archaeology,” said Polly Hubbard, manager of the Peabody’s K-12 education programs and the chief organizer of the event. “We are really excited to be able to create this little portal into Harvard social science.”
Families with young children, Harvard affiliates, and local adults attending the event participated in interactive activities, such as handling dart-throwers like those used for the ancient hunting practice of Atlatl.
“It’s really fun to imagine yourself back in time and to try and put yourself in the shoes of somebody 30,000 years ago,” Hubbard said.
In addition to exhibits organized by the museums, the event featured undergraduate and graduate research. Sarah J. Martini ’16 returned to the fair for the third time to share research she is conducting in New Mexico with the goal of determining the original sizes of indigenous populations before they suffered major population losses.
Martini said she hopes to get people interested in archaeology so that they can “have the revelation that archaeology can actually influence people’s perception of important questions.”
Although he is not planning to concentrate in anthropology, Casey K. Moore ’18 presented findings from the Harvard Yard Archaeology Project, to which he contributed during a year-long anthropology course he took the previous school year. The class excavated a section of Harvard Yard and analyzed their findings. Moore’s presentation included pictures of the dig and different tools used to recover the artifacts.The class endeavored to gain insights about the Indian college that existed at Harvard in the 17th century.
Moore and his classmates considered the project a chance to share the story of a group that has been overlooked in many historical accounts of that time.
“For us this is another opportunity to...reach out to the public,” Moore said.
Needham resident Katherine K. Domoto was drawn to the event for the chance to see the “backside” of the museum.
“I think it’s a great idea to have it open...so you can ask people things rather than just looking at things,” Domoto said.

The Harvard College Library and the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures are creating an archive to preserve materials related to the January attack on French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo and its aftermath.
On the Jan. 7 attack, 11 people were killed when two jihadist gunmen stormed the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris in retribution for the magazine’s publication of cartoons that satirized Prophet Muhammad. Two days after the Charlie Hebdo attack, an additional four people were killed and 15 others held hostage in a kosher supermarket, also in Paris. The tragedy prompted worldwide debate about issues related to free speech and Islamic extremism.
Nicole A. Mills, the department of Romance Languages and Literatures’ senior preceptor, was in Paris in the days after the attacks and decided to collect as many related materials as she could.
“I felt this urgency, that I needed to collect as many materials as possible,” Mills said. “I collected every newspaper, every magazine. I walked around the city and I took photos of graffiti and banners and posters.”
While she originally tried to preserve the materials for use by language instructors, Mills said, she and Romance Languages and Literatures professor Virginie E. Greene instead approached librarians last March about making them available to a broader audience.
The archive will collect “as many materials as we can related to these series of events and the debate that happened afterward,” Greene said. “It’s a group of events which is very defined in time, but raised a lot of different issues.”
The archive includes cartoons, articles, journals, and other documents; it also preserves more “ephemeral” items like posters, graffiti, and banners, Greene said. The majority of materials are from France, though the archive will also feature items from around the world.
“It’s important for the library to take an active role in documenting because many of these materials are ephemeral. They could be lost forever,” said Lidia Uziel, the head of the library’s Western Languages division who is working with Greene and Mills to establish the archive.
Beginning in January, all of the materials will be made available to anyone who has access to the Harvard libraries, and some materials will be made available to the public when possible, according to the project’s leaders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year that saw a spike in faculty growth for the first time since the financial crisis, the size of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences stalled again in fiscal year 2015, shrinking by one professor, according to the school’s annual report.
In fiscal year 2014, Harvard’s flagship faculty grew to a record size of 730 junior and senior professors, the largest in its history, after remaining primarily flat since 2008.
This past year, however, FAS cut back on its ladder faculty hire searches by about a third, partly to reallocate funds for faculty research, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith. The cuts come at a time when federal funding for research at Harvard and across the country continues to decline. 
But while the size of the Faculty decreased slightly in 2015, its endowment grew to more than $16.1 billion, the highest point since 2008, marking continued recovery since the onset of the financial crisis—when the FAS endowment’s market value of $16.7 billion fell $5 billion in a single year. FAS also ran a deficit of $11.7 million in 2015, a decrease from the $77 million deficit of the previous fiscal year.
FAS financial and faculty reports—released to faculty members ahead of their monthly meeting on Tuesday and shared with The Crimson—offer glimpses of the challenges facing Harvard’s flagship faculty as it moves into the 2016 fiscal year.
The reports describe a faculty body feeling the effects of federal research funding decreases, an endowment growing and approaching its pre-financial crisis height, and an overall successful capital campaign with certain fundraising priorities lagging. They also outline a struggle with diversity: About a third of women up for tenure last academic year left FAS before their final review, a trend the annual report terms “troubling.”
FEDERAL FUNDING TAKES HOLD
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences saw a stall in growth in fiscal year 2015, cutting faculty searches by 34 percent partly in an effort to reallocate money to finance research.
The total number of ladder faculty members, including junior and senior professors, dropped from 730 to 729 in fiscal year 2015, and FAS conducted searches for just 56 tenure and tenure-track positions, compared to 85 in fiscal year 2014.
This came as federal funding for FAS research fell by 6.3 percent to $141.9 million between fiscal years 2014 and 2015, following a 2.2 percent decline between 2013 and 2014, according to FAS fiscal managerial reports. 2014 was the first full fiscal year after the federal government enacted broad budget cuts known as sequestration.
The cuts deeply affected federal entities including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense—the three agencies accounted for the majority of all sponsored FAS research in the last fiscal year.
Non-federally sponsored research also decreased by 3.6 percent in the last fiscal year, meaning total sponsored research in FAS fell by 5.7 percent to $203.2 million.
Although FAS’s external research funding fell in 2015, the school’s endowment remained strong, at $16.1 billion. Long-term investments continued several years of growth, with endowment returns of 5.8 percent, marking a decrease from the two-digit percent returns posted in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.
A ‘TROUBLING’ TREND
“Unfortunately, all is not good news in the report on faculty trends,” Smith wrote in the FAS annual report, pointing to the percentage of women who leave Harvard’s tenure track before their final review.
The report details a trend in the departure of female faculty members before they stand for full-time tenure review. Last academic year, only 66 percent of women up for the final tenure review—which determines whether or not junior faculty members will be promoted to full-time, tenured professors—actually stayed at Harvard through that review, compared to 78 percent of men, a difference the report calls “troubling.”
In interviews with tenure-track women who were leaving Harvard, administrators found a “striking” reason that they left was an uncomfortable culture in their respective departments, according to the report.
“In many cases, these faculty members found that the culture of the department was not conducive to their productivity and was a significant factor in their decision to leave,” the report reads.
To abate the problem, administrators plan to review departmental mentoring programs, create more leadership workshops for tenure-track faculty, add symposia for tenure-track women in different divisions, and increase the amount of day care provided to FAS affiliates. Mahzarin R. Banaji, FAS’s senior advisor on faculty development, said the school is also focusing on decreasing the effects of implicit biases on the faculty search process.
Still, women’s representation on the Faculty grew slightly in fiscal year 2015, up to 28 from 27 percent in 2014. Minorities also saw marginal growth, bumping to 21 percent from 19 percent last year.
HOUSING COSTS
FAS pulled $70.1 million from its endowment in part to help finance the renovation of the undergraduate Houses, continuing to shift unrestricted funds to cover House renewal costs. Meanwhile, the House renewal project lagged behind other fundraising priorities—by August, it had not yet reached the halfway mark for its $400 million portion of the FAS’s $2.5 billion capital campaign.
Smith said recently that the challenge of articulating the vision for what was long only an abstract initiative made raising funds for the project more difficult than some of the campaign’s other priorities.
Some priorities, like the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—bolstered by a $400 million gift this June—and the “Faculty and Our Scholarly Enterprise” category have surpassed or neared their fundraising goals. The “Leading in Learning” priority, along with House renewal, lag behind, not yet halfway to their goals.
According to Smith, fundraising efforts will now focus more on these lagging priorities, which he said are often difficult for alumni to conceptualize.
Overall, the FAS capital campaign raised $767.7 million in fiscal year 2015 toward its $2.5 billion goal, according to an update distributed to the Faculty prior to its Tuesday meeting. In total, the campaign has raised $2.2 billion as it enters the third year of its public phase.
Over the fiscal year, the FAS campaign attracted 44,623 donors, including individuals, corporations, and foundations, from 50 states and 107 countries.
As of August, 60,835 donors had contributed over the course of the entire campaign, 40 of whom had each given more than $10 million and a majority of the donations. Forty-three percent of total FAS funds raised, a plurality, originate from the New York area.
Some alumni classes have donated more than others. The class of 1975, for example, has raised $72 million for their 40th reunion campaign. Five years out of their graduation, 741 members of the class of 2010 have contributed to the campaign thus far.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Family and colleagues remembered History professor Mark A. Kishlansky at a memorial service in Memorial Church on Friday, a nod to Kishlansky’s lasting legacy as both a dedicated educator and vivid storyteller.
Kishlansky, who came to Harvard in 1991 as a professor of 17th-century British history, died on May 19. He was 66. 
It is “not enough to say he lived to teach, but rather that he lived to affect others with his infectious enthusiasm,” said Matthew T. Kishlansky ’00, the professor’s son.
Kishlansky enjoyed an illustrious career teaching courses on British social history and the English Revolution. He served as the associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1997 to 2001.
Sharing anecdotes about Kishlansky, colleagues and family at the service Friday remembered his boisterous laughter, liveliness, and wit.
Michael McCormick, a professor of medieval history, described Kishlansky as “one of a kind: feisty, funny, and sometimes sarcastic”. 
Kishlansky’s energy translated into a true dedication to students and his teaching. Former students Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, a History professor at Harvard, and Paul D. Halliday, a professor of history and law at the University of Virginia, both reminisced over Kishlansky’s engaging retelling of the beheading of King Charles I. Both attributed their decisions to later pursue academic careers in history to the engaging professor.
“He was truly the most hilarious man I’ve ever met,” Jasanoff said. “He has left an enduring mark.”
Kishlansky pioneered the initiative to involve senior professors in sophomore and junior history tutorials, an enduring legacy that lasts to this day, according to McCormick. He added that Kishlansky’s actions helped attract many bright students to the History Department, who went on to pursue successful careers in history, business, government, and law.
“He was not just hilarious; his axioms were amazing,” McCormick said. “He truly changed the teaching life of the History Department.”
The service included several songs by Bob Dylan, one of Kishlansky’s favorite musicians, and featured readings of his favorite writers, George Orwell and William Shakespeare. A reception ta the Harvard Faculty Club followed the service.

In addition to providing free internet access, Harvard Square now boasts a complimentary rapid phone charging station that refuels mobile devices while soliciting donations for a local nonprofit organization.
The new charging station, located in the CVS vestibule at 6 JFK St., solicits donations for Y2Y Harvard Square, a student-run youth homeless shelter that is scheduled to open this fall.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said plans for the project were initiated by Daniel E. Fraine, the senior vice president of facilities at the Cambridge Savings Bank, which owns the building that houses the Starbucks and CVS.
“The bank wanted the rapid charger to be free and available to the public,” she said.
Jillson added that including a charitable component was a priority for the project. “It’s a way of building community and also encouraging people to donate money to a social service agency rather than put money in a cup,” she said.
Y2Y Harvard Square is the first organization for which the charging station is encouraging voluntary donations. The charging station adapts technology developed by SplitNGo, a local company that enables restaurant customers to pay bills from their phones, facilitating rapid and safe donations.
“We thought that while people were standing around waiting for their rapid charge, there’s information about SplitNGo and Y2Y [available at the station],” Jillson said. “If people don’t make a contribution, it’s just helping people be aware.”
According to SplitNGo founder Andres Sarmiento, people using the charging station will see that users can go to splitngo.com, type or scan a code, indicate a donation amount, and take a picture of their credit card to donate to Y2Y.
Samuel G. Greenberg ’14, co-director of Y2Y, wrote in an email that the Y2Y team was “thrilled about the opportunity [and] incredibly grateful to all involved for their help in creating and sustaining Y2Y.”
According to Jillson, who used the charging station herself at the ribbon-cutting ceremony last week, the public has reacted positively to the new addition to the Square. It is not yet known how much money Y2Y has raised through donations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed a finalized version of its budget for the 2016 fiscal year at its general meeting on Sunday.
At its last general meeting on Sept. 20, the Council considered a preliminary version of the budget with the intent of making revisions in the following weeks. The finalized budget, which passed unanimously, remained largely similar to the preliminary one except for increases to the Council’s grants fund and the Student Initiatives Committee and Student Relations Committee budgets.
The Student Initiatives Committee budget increased to $15,000 to fully fund the number of events proposed by the committee, which is responsible for organizing and funding student initiatives, including parties, for undergraduates. To give the Student Relations Committee funding to host various House-wide study breaks for upperclassmen this year, the Council added an extra $3,600 to its budget, bringing the total to $5,100.
The finalized budget also reserves $5,000 for a “crazy idea fund,” to be allocated to an event or program proposed by a Council representative that falls outside the purview of one of the Council’s committees. Even with this fund, UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 encouraged representatives to exhaust other avenues of funding before using the money.
According to Kanuparthy, the initial UC budget and the final one passed on Sunday differed because he estimated lower levels of termbill funding that the Council would receive this year in preparing the preliminary budget. The UC receives the vast majority of their revenues from a $75 fee charged to every undergraduate on their termbill, but students have the option to opt out of it.
Elm Yard representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 suggested that the Council move $5,000 from the rest of the budget to the $15,000 already allocated for freshman programming. The Council did not take up the proposal, with Kanuparthy saying the increase in funding would not be feasible.
The Council also unanimously voted to earmark $700 to the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub to provide food and non-alcoholic beverages at a “pregame” for an event, dubbed the “Blank“ Party, planned for Oct. 9. Student Initiatives Committee chair Daniel V. Banks ’17 said he hopes the funding will “provide a safe place” for an inclusive pregame prior to the College-wide party, which is sponsored by several women’s groups on campus.
At the general meeting, UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 updated the Council on Omni, a reboot of the “Harvard” smartphone application targeted at undergraduates. Goyal said downloads of the app have surpassed 4,000.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing a line of major changes at Harvard Management Company, two high-level managers departed recently with little notice.
The departures of eight-year fixed-income manager Marco C. Barrozo and Satu Parikh, who joined HMC in 2011 as managing director and head of commodities, were first reported in The Boston Globe Friday, which cited an internal email to HMC employees.
In an endowment update at the end of September, HMC president and chief executive officer Stephen Blyth praised Parikh for his contribution to the 3.5 percent return earned by the natural resources and commodities team, writing that “the positive return from our commodity relative-value team led by Satu Parikh was impressive, and indicative of our ability to extract value from volatile and distressed markets, agnostic of market direction.”
In the update, Blyth credited the fixed income team for its “long-term, consistent run of outperformance,” but did not mention Barrozo by name.
For the time being, Barrozo and Parikh’s responsibilities will be absorbed by other managers, according to the Globe. HMC will also have another vacancy at the end of the year, as Andrew G. Wiltshire recently announced his plans to retire from his alternative assets managership.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
The departures come shortly after Harvard’s endowment rose to $37.6 billion, but with a 5.8 percent overall return trailed the rates of many peer Universities. Blyth, who took up the position in January after Jane L. Mendillo stepped down, promised serious changes at HMC in a letter to alumni last month.
“HMC must remain competitive for Harvard itself to confidently maintain its own preeminence as a University,” Blyth wrote. “However, recent performance against [the top 10 endowments] metric has been disappointing.”
Blythe listed performing in the top quartile of the top 10 university endowments as one of his goals . Last year, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Yale respectively notched 7 percent, 13.2 percent, and 11.5 percent returns on their endowments.
Under Mendillo’s leadership, Harvard did not fare well against other large endowments, often beating internal benchmarks but lagging behind its peers.
One point of controversy surrounding HMC is its compensation model, in which executives made multiples more than University President Drew G. Faust’s salary while not boasting better endowment returns than other institutions. Blyth wrote in his letter that he plans to tie in compensation more with fund-wide performance, rather than solely judging managers on individual returns. In 2013, Blythe earned $11.5 million in compensation.

Humans may soon have the ability to write our own evolution, said Janet Rich-Edwards, a School of Public Health professor who organized a one-day science symposium focused on recent advances in understanding ancient and modern DNA and possible application for future research.
“The Past, Present, and Future of DNA,” as the symposium was called, faculty discussed a range of topics, from personal genomics to the applications of modern DNA technology in legal investigations.
“We felt that DNA was particularly good subject matter, because there are people doing cutting edge work in DNA involved in biology, legal matters, anthropology, and much more, ” said Alison F. Franklin ’90, the director of communications at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, which hosted the event.
Beth A. Shapiro, an associate professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a MacArthur Fellow, spoke at length about the challenges of working with ancient DNA and the feasibility of using fossilized remains to clone woolly mammoths.
“I really enjoyed the talks this morning,” said Alison Cloutier, a postdoctoral fellow studying genomics at Harvard. “I think they had a really good level of accessibility to people who aren’t in the field, but it was also really interesting for people who do study DNA.”
Cloutier, along with many other attendees, named Shapiro’s presentation as her favorite.
Attendees at the packed venue included graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Boston University, Tufts, and MIT. Graduate students presented their research to conference attendees and speakers during two poster sessions between panels.
“The cool thing about a cross-disciplinary symposium like this is that you have people here looking at [DNA] from an evolutionary perspective, from a medical perspective, and people that are just interested in learning in general,” said Evelyn J. Jagoda, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology who presented her work during a poster session. “Everyone learns something.”
The symposium was the first part of the DNA lecture series. The next lecture, “Prospects for a Vaccine and a Cure for HIV,” will feature Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Academics, artists, corporate sponsors, and activists joined on Friday to push for action to address climate change at a concert and speaking event at Boston’s Ritz-Carlton hotel.
The event, organized by the student-led campaign Know Tomorrow, took place on the group’s “National Day of Action.” Know Tomorrow is recognized by 60 colleges across the nation, according to its website, and is affiliated with former Vice President Al Gore ’69’s Climate Reality Project.
The event’s headliners included U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey and Harvard English professor James T. Engell ’73. Engell took the stage after a musical performance by Outasight and an address by Adam Sachs of Biodiversity for a Livable Climate.
“This is a fight that’s got a stopwatch on it,” Engell said. “Whether one believes in divestment or not as a tool, there is a lot to be learned about climate disruption and what human beings are doing to cause it.”
Engell signed an open faculty letter—which now includes more than 260 signatories—to University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, urging them to divest the endowment from fossil fuel companies in 2014. The Harvard Faculty for Divestment group formed after University President Drew G. Faust argued against divestment in an October 2013 open letter.
For his part, Engell said that he hopes for environmental education to play a bigger role in Harvard’s curriculum.
“We don’t require students to study anything in the environmental line,” Engell said. “They have Gen Ed requirements and concentration requirements. I myself wish that we might be able at some point to consider a requirement in environmental education because I think it’s absolutely crucial if you’re going to connect yourself with the realities of the world now and in the future.”
Perhaps the event’s most recognizable figure, Markey has been vocal about climate reform. His appearance at the event came a day after he released a statement calling for stricter pollution controls.
Emma Marshall-Torres, a student at Boston and an organizer of the event, said she liked how the function helped contextualize climate change for attendees and might make the issue “real for a lot of people.”
Cara Kennedy Cuomo ’17, another student organizer, called the event a success.
“It’s the kind of event that encompasses all different aspects of climate change and climate change activism,” Cuomo said. “I think students have a voice, and they should absolutely use it no matter what they believe in no matter where on the political spectrum they fall.”
Divest Harvard, an on-campus activist group that demands that Harvard divest its $37.6 billion endowment from fossil fuels, was offered an opportunity to participate in the event but did not send a group presence, according to Talia K. Rothstein ’17, a co-coordinator of the group.

The Harvard women’s volleyball team got back on track towards its goal of repeating as Ivy League champions with a clean sweep of rivals Penn and Princeton this weekend.
The victories were crucial for the Crimson (6-7, 2-1 Ivy) after the Cambridge squad dropped its Ivy League opener to Dartmouth. No team in the last eight years has won the Ancient Eight title after losing more than two games, making each matchup for Harvard pivotal at this stage in the season.
“Our mentality was a lot stronger [this weekend],” said senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace. “We came in with a fire and a passion, which we had at Dartmouth but we didn’t maintain as well.”
HARVARD 3, PENN 0
In front of a large crowd in the Malkin Athletic Center, Harvard marched its way to a 3-0 victory over Penn (8-7, 2-1 Ivy), snapping the Quakers’ four-game win streak.
The first set would turn out to be the closest. Penn clawed its way back from a large early deficit, but still fell six points short to the Crimson.
The Harvard momentum carried over into the next two sets, as the Quakers only managed 27 total points. In each frame, Harvard took an early lead and never allowed Penn back into the game.
“I think we did an excellent job and we stuck to the game plan,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “Everybody really did a great job. We want to keep this momentum going.”
The Crimson’s efforts were spearheaded by Wallace, who finished the night with a team-high 13 kills, followed by freshman middle blocker Christina Cornelius with eight and junior setter Corinne Bain with seven.
Senior outside hitter Alexis Genske led Penn on the night with seven kills and six digs.
Genske’s efforts were not enough to stop the Crimson, however, as six different Harvard players recorded three or more kills, and the Cambridge squad improved to 2-1 in the Ivy League.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
The Crimson started and ended the weekend in the same fashion, taking off quickly in its game against Princeton (5-7, 0-3 Ivy) and never looking back, en route to a straight-sets victory over the Tigers.
The Crimson made some important adjustments to rebound from its loss against Dartmouth and demonstrated improved defensive play as it finished the weekend without giving up a set to its Ivy conference opponents.
Princeton’s play was anchored by senior Kendall Peterkin and freshman Nnenna Ibe. Both players finished with eight kills, a subpar showing for Peterkin, who has otherwise averaged over 13 kills per games for the Tigers this season.
Princeton drew first blood in the game, but Harvard responded swiftly and pulled away to take the first and second sets by a combined score of 14 points.
The Tigers finally found their footing in the third frame, and the teams traded a narrow lead back and forth for much of the set. Eventually, with the score knotted at 19 all, three unanswered kills from Wallace helped Harvard pull away to take the game.
Wallace led Harvard’s efforts all night, and finished with a game-high 16 kills. The senior had been sidelined by an injury for the previous several games, and her return to the court was a welcome sight for the team.
“It’s great to have [Wallace] back on the court,” Weiss said. “She’s playing hard and she really did a fantastic job.”
Bain also totaled 10 kills and nine digs, while Cornelius had another breakout performance, racking up five kills and five blocks.
“[Cornelius] is always so dynamic, she’s always crafty with her shots, and her blocking is incredible,” Wallace said. “Being a freshman and stepping up to the plate, she’s really made a huge impact on the team.”
It was an important night for co-captain Caroline Holte as well. The senior bested the Harvard volleyball program’s all-time record for block assists, surpassing Suzie Trimble ’08 for the top spot. Holte now has 303 to her name.

Entering his 40th season as the Harvard men’s tennis head coach, Dave Fish ’72 has worked with an abundance of young tennis players during his tenure with the Crimson. Even then, the four-time ITA Regional Coach of the Year has been particularly impressed with this year’s youngsters, who performed well this past weekend at the MIT Beanpot, one of Harvard’s fall invitational tournaments.
Freshmen Michael Peters and Christopher Morrow continued their fine starts to their Crimson careers against MIT on Saturday morning, a match in which Harvard teamed up with Dartmouth men’s tennis to play the Engineers. Peters won both of his matches against MIT, partnering with sophomore Kenny Tao to defeat MIT freshmen Tyler Barr and Alex Cauneac before defeating Henry La Soya in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4.
Peters, a 6’5” former football player, is playing tennis year-round for the first time since the start of high school. His development has been rapid as a result which is reflected in his recent results.
“With someone like Michael Peters, who has a gigantic forehand, we’re trying to help him…[move] more north-south, from the baseline to the net, rather than east-west along the baseline,” Fish said. “There are a lot of guys who can go east to west, but when he comes forward, he can scare the hell out of people. Anytime he can hit a second serve and come to the net, or step around and hit a forehand, or serve and volley—that’s a pressure package play.”
Morrow and sophomore partner Xavier Gonzalez defeated the MIT junior duo of Moseley Andrews and Kristopher Bronner, 6-2. Gonzalez won his singles match against Engineers freshman Sean Ko, 6-4, 6-3. Morrow, meanwhile, upset senior Dennis Garcia, 6-2, 6-4.
“Christopher Morrow has a very all-court style,” Fish said. “He’s very fast, has wonderful balance, and is adding some offense, some penetration with his groundstrokes.”
This tournament provided an excellent opportunity for younger members of the team to get more game action and work on their skills and conditioning. A key aspect of this weekend’s matches at MIT was getting used to playing indoors, something the Crimson’s less experienced players will have to deal with much more frequently going forward.
Another benefit of the low-key nature of the tournament was the chance for Tao to work his way back to full fitness. Tao, who is currently recovering from a bout with influenza and early-season shin splints, played extensively this weekend, winning both of his doubles matches with Peters against MIT and Amherst, and splitting his two singles matches. His one loss, at the hands of MIT’s Cauneac, was tightly contested. After winning the first set 6-1, Tao fell 6-4 in the second before losing the deciding tiebreaker, 10-7.
“On the second day, my shoulder started getting really sore, which is why I couldn’t keep my performance up throughout the whole match,” Tao said. “Overall, I’m very happy with how I played.”
Harvard also had split-squad action against Amherst on Friday afternoon and Boston University on Saturday afternoon. Peters, Tao, and several other Harvard players were victorious against Amherst, getting the weekend off to a strong start. Only Peters and senior Kelvin Lam featured against the Terriers in the Saturday afternoon match.
After appearing in the NCAA tournament for the past three seasons, the Crimson are looking to repeat that feat while perhaps picking up some Ancient Eight silverware in the process. Winning the conference, however, will be a tall order given the league’s depth.

With a cool breeze blowing from the Oklahoma river, rowers from all walks of life racing past in competition with one another, and the banks of the river teeming with even more spectators, the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team found itself on familiar waters on Saturday in Oklahoma City as it prepared to compete in the Head of the Oklahoma regatta. The Crimson looked to maintain its place at the head of the Head, building off of its two-win streak that it had established in the 2012 and 2013 seasons.
“There was a little bit of pressure on us to stay ahead of some pretty solid schools that we wouldn't normally get to race,” senior Adam Janes said. “The trip is usually meant to be a lot of fun, and lets us break out of our usual routine to race in a new location.”
The team handled the pressure well, placing first out of the collegiate boats in its final race and in the process besting its 2014 time by four seconds. Battling it out in a nail-biter that went down to the end of the race, the Crimson edged out the second place collegiate-finishing boat, Oklahoma City, by less than a second. Harvard’s boat, led by captain James Croxford, Janes, and senior Achim Harzheim, finished the race in 1:18.98. Oklahoma City’s boat finished with a time of 1:19.96.
The Crimson’s day began in the late afternoon with a night sprints qualifier. The boat featured a lineup that included a sophomore and two juniors in the traditionally-senior boat.
“The senior class boat which raced today had a lot of quality athletes on board,” Janes said. “It was a fantastic experience to relive some great memories of our freshman year together.”
Though this group was relatively untested and faced a strong headwind for a long portion of the race, the boat had a strong showing in the qualifying race. Harvard pushed off first in the event, with the second starting the event over 30 seconds later. To deal with the feeling of rowing in a vacuum by itself, the team just focused on its own performance.
In addition to stiff competition from the other collegiate boats, the team raced against a U.S. Rowing team. This did not faze Harvard though, and the team stayed in close competition.
“We started ahead of Oklahoma City Rowing Club, who proved to be the toughest opposition that we had to face,” Janes said. “We were able to keep them in our sights all the way down the course.”
The boat which also held sophomore Cole Durbin, senior James Green, senior Stefano Belfiore, junior Ross Jarvis, and junior Henry Kennelly in addition to Croxford, Janes, and Harzheim, came out strong, getting into a rhythm that helped it gain and never never lose the lead. It cruised past the finish line with a time of 13:15.13.
Oklahoma City University’s A boat came in second place almost nine seconds later at 13:23.86. Oregon State’s A boat, OKC’s B boat, and and Washington’s A boat rounded out the top five for the Men’s Collegiate 8+ race with times of 13.32.18, 14:15.25, and 15:15.59, respectively. With its win Harvard advanced to the 500 meter Grand Final race later that night, along with the other Top 3 finishers from its preliminary race.
“It's definitely exciting to have some success early in the year,” sixth position rower Croxford said. “However we are mindful that we have some more very competitive races coming up towards the end of the Fall and throughout the Spring so we are doing our best to continuously improve and put ourselves in the best position possible to be successful at those events as well.”

Third time was truly the charm for the Harvard men’s golf team this season. In its third tournament of the fall, the Crimson came away with a first-place finish and brought the Macdonald Cup home to Cambridge this weekend.
Thirteen squads made the trek to the Yale Golf Course in New Haven, Conn., to participate in the event, which was hosted by the Bulldogs. Joining Harvard and Yale were fellow Ancient Eight teams Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell, Brown, and Penn.
“It was really good for us to be able to play well against the rest of the Ivy League,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We’ve been improving week-by-week, and this week we were finally able to go out there and put it all together. We’re in a good position moving forward.”
The course played at par 70, with only two par-5 holes of the 18. The invite featured an abbreviated schedule of play, with just two rounds of play.
Harvard jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, shooting a round 1 score of 285. This was good enough to position the team four strokes ahead of Dartmouth after Saturday's play.
The Crimson played even better in round 2, shooting a 283 to extend its lead to 12 shots over runner-up Minnesota. Overall, Harvard finished just eight strokes over par as a team.
“Everyone on the team had a great attitude this weekend throughout the tournament,” sophomore Hale Furey said. “We didn’t let the rain and wind deter us at all throughout the day, and I think that shows how mentally tough we are. I think the weather really fit our team’s personality.”
On the individual side, Crimson players dominated the leaderboard, laying claim to four of the top five players. Junior Robert Deng finished the day in second place, one shot behind Minnesota’s Jon DuToit. Deng’s first-round 73 and second-round 67 put him at an even-par 140 for the tournament. His score of 67 was tied with DuToit for the lowest single-round score of the event.
“I think this week we finally saw all the guys get fully settled in,” Rhoads said. “Sometimes it’s hard for players to adjust to the school year and balance their time coming back in from the summer. This week we saw a lot of the team playing at the top of its game and that’s something I hope we can continue moving forward.”
Finishing right behind Deng was a trio of teammates. Junior Daniel De La Garza fired a 142, good enough for third place. Junior Kendrick Vinar and freshman Aurian Capart finished just one stroke behind De La Garza, tying for fourth place. Rounding out the board for Harvard was Furey, who finished in a tie for sixth place.
Freshman Seiya Liu came out of the gates hot, shooting a first-round 69 that led all participants. He finished the day tied for 19th overall.
“The problem we have is the best possible problem,” Rhoads said. “We have a whole team of players who could be among the best in the league having to compete every week to make the team, [and] it really speaks to the depth of this year’s team.”
Captain Rohan Ramnath was again out of action this weekend due to injury. The team hopes he will back and healthy for the fourth and final tournament of the fall half of the season at UCLA in November.
“This is the most competitive the team has ever been before,” Furey said. “It’s really hard to make the team each and every week because of the number of high-quality players we have, so I think we have a chance to be really successful moving forward and building momentum.”

Bracing torrential downpour and icy winds for most of the weekend, the Harvard women’s golf team edged Princeton out by one stroke to rise from fourth on Saturday to first place on Sunday in the Princeton Invitational.
“I feel really proud because the conditions were definitely tough,” senior Courtney Hooton said. “It was raining the first two days… [and] the course still wasn’t in the best condition. Just the fact that we were able to push through all those conditions and have a great performance really speaks to our level of our ability right now.”
Hooton led the Crimson this weekend at the Springdale Golf Club in Princeton, NJ, a plus-3 score on Sunday boosting her from ninth place to tie for second place. Freshman Michelle Xie finished close behind Hooton, shooting up 24 spots with a plus-1 score in the second round to tie for fifth place.
Four of five Harvard competitors placed in the top-10 by the end of tournament. While the Crimson previously trailed Princeton, Columbia, and Rutgers, a plus-10 finish in the second round allowed the team to overtake the top three schools, who scored plus-23, plus-23, and plus-30, respectively, on Sunday.
“We all just stayed focus and everything worked out,” junior Anne Cheng said. “We were really surprised, but we were also really happy and excited about the end result.”
Due to a storm in the area when the team arrived on Friday, it had to forgo its typical pre-tournament practice round, which allows to the competitors to see the course and get a general feel for it. Harvard did not play in the Princeton Invitational last year, and the lack of familiarity proved to be an obstacle on Saturday.
“The first day the conditions were definitely really tough, and for our freshmen it was the first time they’d ever played the course,” Hooton said. “There are definitely a few holes that are very tricky if you don’t know where you’re going, so I think because we weren’t able to play a full practice round, playing the course for the first time [was] definitely a tough thing to do.”
With clearer skies on Sunday and an increased familiarity with the course, however, all Harvard competitors showed vastly improved scores. Hooton went from plus-5 to plus-3 and Xie from plus-6 to plus-1. Cheng, who tied for eighth overall, scored plus-11 on Saturday and plus-2 on Sunday, while Christine Lin, who also tied for eighth, went plus-11 then plus-4. Rounding out the team, Anna Zhou improved from plus-18 to plus-6.
“Our first day of the tournament was just playing it as it is without having much information about the course,” Cheng said. “That could have been part of why we played better in the second round, because we knew what to expect and we knew how to approach each hole.”
Strong individual performances highlighted the second round. Hooton started the day facing a particularly long and treacherous 10th hole but managed to get up and down from the bunker and stay par.
“That’s a really tricky hole, and I usually just consider a bogie a good enough score on that hole, so I started off on a good note and that was fun,” Hooton said.
Hooton’s final plus-8 score fell short only to Georgetown sophomore Jacquelyn Eleey.
Cheng also felt the effect of better conditions on Sunday.

This past weekend, the Harvard field hockey team (6-3, 1-1 Ivy) recovered from an overtime loss to Ivy League rival Penn (5-6, 1-2) to dominate Fairfield (4-5), 4-0.
HARVARD 4, FAIRFIELD 0
In its final game of the weekend, the Crimson rebounded by recording its third shutout of the season.
“The team was pretty disappointed with the loss yesterday, obviously,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “I think they wanted to redeem themselves, and I think that created a lot of energy for us.”
Six minutes into the game, the Crimson utilized a penalty corner to get on the board. Junior forward Marissa Balleza, Harvard's top scorer, connected with sophomore midfielder Hannah Wellington for her first goal of the season.
The Crimson tallied its second goal of the half when junior forward Sarah Finnemore passed to senior midfielder Madison Jung, who scored with a quick shot into the corner of the net.
Harvard kept up its momentum in the second half by opening the period with a goal from freshman forward Kathleen Young, assisted by Balleza, two minutes in. The duo connected again less than eight minutes later when Young shot into the right side of an open goal.
“A freshman scoring two goals is always strong,” van Herwaarden said.
Balleza’s three assists bring the junior into a tie for eighth place in Crimson history in points. Balleza is also only one goal away from joining only six Harvard players with 30 career goals. Co-captain Elizabeth Jacobson also has her name in the record books, as she is ranked 10th in points and fifth in game-winning goals.
Fairfield nearly broke the shutout, but the team's lone goal of the game was dismissed by the referees after a long conference. Most of the action took place on the Stags' side of the field, as Harvard recorded 14 shots on goal compared to only six for Fairfield.
In the latter half of the second frame, Harvard relieved senior goalie Issy Davies with sophomore Olivia Startup, who played for 14 minutes without facing one shot on goal.
Co-captain Caroline Code praised her team’s ability to rebound following the tough loss to the Quakers.
“We were pretty angry, but I think it says a lot about a team who is able to turn a loss into motivation to win the next day,” Code said. “I’m happy that we had today to prove that.”
PENN 2, HARVARD 1
After recording four shots on goal within nine minutes of the first half, Balleza found the back of the net to score her eighth goal of the season. Young set up the junior by passing from the top of the arc off a penalty corner.
In the second half, Harvard nearly secured its lead when Jacobson capitalized on another Crimson penalty corner to score. However, the potential game-changing goal was waved off after a referee conference.
“The second goal that was scored against—I thought was a clean goal,” van Herwaarden said. “But eventually they took it away from us. That was a breaking point.”
Harvard’s defense held the Quakers scoreless for almost all of the regulated time, until Penn’s Gina Guccione broke through and tied the game with only 3:43 left to play, forcing the Crimson into overtime for the second time this year.
The Crimson led in shots on goal after the first half, but the tables quickly turned in the second half as the Quakers dominated the count, 11-2. This trend continued in overtime where Penn mostly stayed on the attack with six shots on goal.
The Quakers managed an overtime shutout of sorts against Harvard, holding the Crimson to zero attempts on goal. Eleven minutes into overtime, Penn’s Elizabeth Hitti sent an initial shot on goal that was knocked in by teammate Elise Tilton.
The conference loss broke Harvard’s four-game winning streak, leaving the Crimson tied for third in the Ivy League alongside Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth and Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forward Midge Purce recorded her first collegiate hat trick as the Harvard women’s soccer team cruised to a 4-0 victory over Yale on Saturday in New Haven. The women’s soccer edition of The Game saw the Crimson produce its most goals of the season and post its largest margin of victory.
“Every game we play in the Ivy League is a huge game,” Purce said. “It’s really important to the whole season because we only have seven of them. Every single team we play is a contender to be the Ivy League champion.”
Harvard (4-6-1, 2-0-0 Ivy) put the game out of the reach of the Bulldogs (3-5-2, 0-2-0) within the contest’s first six minutes. Purce picked up a goal in the second minute and another one in the sixth, while junior defender Bailey Gary picked up the first goal of her collegiate career, an unassisted tally that was sandwiched between two assists on her classmate’s goals.
“It definitely was a really good defensive performance,” senior Brooke Dickens said. “To have a defender [score and have two assists] is really awesome. We really limited Yale’s scoring chances and played well in the back. Our defense in the middle, all the way up to the forwards, was really good too.”
The Crimson dominated in all facets of the game, registering 21 shots, including 11 on net, while only allowing four Yale shots all afternoon. Through a pair of Ivy League games, Harvard has registered 22 shots on net and six goals—one more score than the team had through its first nine contests.
Even after going up 3-0 in the first, the Crimson did not let up on either end. The offense unleashed eight more shots and had four corner kicks, while the defense only conceded two Yale shots both before and after halftime. The barrage was led by Purce and sophomore midfielder Dani Stollar, who both had five shots apiece on the game.
The final goal of the hat trick and fifth of the season for Purce came in the 51st minute. Co-captain Haley Washburn sent a pass to Purce and the Olney, Md., native beat Bulldogs goalkeeper Rachel Ames for the third time. It was also the fourth goal for Purce against Yale in her career.
For Harvard, the fast start was something the team has not been accustomed to this season. The three first half goals were the most the team has had since the first round of last season’s NCAA Tournament. The team had tallied only two first half goals all season before Saturday.
“It definitely gives your team a boost because you know that you’re ahead,” Dickens said. “It happened, but you play afterwards because you can’t have an attitude of complacency. It’s definitely a nice extra pad when you’re playing, but you have to keep playing the rest of the game as if those goals don’t exist.”
The cold and windy weather in New Haven, Conn., did not seem to bother a Crimson attack that scored its most goals in an Ivy League game since October of last year against Princeton.
The win was not only big for Harvard’s momentum, but it also gave the team a boost in the early Ivy League standings. The Crimson sits at the top of the table, along with Princeton, after a perfect first two weekends in conference play. It was the team’s first road victory since the season opener against Army on Aug. 30.
“Our team sat down and we made clear what our goal was,” Purce said. “We had a very rough preseason, we played absolutely incredible teams and we took from every team and learned something about our own team. At the end of that, we went back to the drawing board, all 27 of us, and said ‘this is what we need to do,’ and we were all in.”
The Bulldogs have not won a game since ousting Villanova on Sept. 11. Harvard’s last loss to Yale was in 2007, and the team is 7-1-1 all-time against the Bulldogs during Crimson coach Ray Leone’s tenure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 5, 2015, at 3:18 a.m.
With two minutes to go, the outlook looked grim for the Harvard women’s rugby team (3-1, 2-1 Ivy) in its home finale. Despite a late-game deficit, the squad came from behind to steal the win from its Princeton opponent by a 17-10 score.
Down 10-5 and on the Tigers (0-1, 0-1 Ivy) goal line, the Crimson looked to rally before the referee delivered what appeared to crippling blow with an offside call.
Freshman Susie Clements sprinted over to the ref and argued the call, and suddenly Harvard had possession again. This time, the group capitalized with a hard-fought try to even the score up at 10-10.
With 30 seconds remaining, the Crimson did it again. When junior Claire Collins received the ball, she was 10 yards from the end zone with a wall of orange and black standing between her and a comeback win. She ran full throttle into the sea of opponents, dodged, then broke through the tackle of a Princeton player before throwing herself past the try line to secure the victory as the clock ticked to expiration.
In a game that was characterized by a series of difficult calls that could have cost the Crimson the match, Harvard continued on for the close win. There were multiple calls against Harvard at the try line that cost the team the ball, but the team rallied against one of its biggest Ivy League rivals.
“I think it was a significant improvement in our composure and trust in each other to come from behind in the second half, and to overcome some unfair calls from the ref,” Parker said. “We pulled a victory really out of the claws of defeat. [This match was a] huge improvement in terms of mental strength from the past few weeks.”
Once the team did get rolling, it scored twice in five minutes, with Clements clinching the victory with a conversion with seconds left in stoppage time. The theme of mental strength prevailed from coach to player.
“I thought it was a fantastic mental game for us,” freshman Sarah Lipson said. “We had a huge conversation about the mental aspect of our game yesterday, and I think that helped. We played all the way through and never stopped. “
Lipson was often the last line of defense when the Princeton wingers broke from the scrum. She was tasked with slowing down the runners and making several crucial tackles. She would do so more than a few times during what turned out to be Harvard’s closest game of the year thus far.
The Crimson got off to a red-hot start with a try in the first three minutes of the match on a 30 yard run from freshman Caitlin Weigel. She broke multiple lines of defense without a touch, and from then on, Harvard controlled the much of the match.
Princeton never really got a foothold in the game, with Harvard holding possession throughout most of the match. With 22 minutes remaining in the half, the Tigers’ Allie Eakes picked up the ball from the scrum and ran for 60 yards before Lipson could make another tackle. On the very next play, Princeton’s Jessica Lu managed to get around the Harvard defense for a quick-strike score.
The rest of the half went by without much action. Harvard controlled possession but did little, while Princeton did not get the big breaks that it needed to score. The teams went into halftime with the teams tied at five points apiece.
The second half was more of the same. Harvard controlled possession, but once again, the Tigers broke free and although Lipson made a successful tackle to bring down the runner, a flip to a trailing teammate put Princeton ahead, 10-5.
While less than enthused with the officiating, Parker was happy with of the outcome of the Crimson’s last home game.
“Once we we actually able to run our game plan with the laws of the game upheld by the ref, then our game plan flowed,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Just one yard from a touchdown, senior Jason Holdway, recently converted from safety to running back, took the handoff and ran into a wall of Georgetown defensive linemen at the line of scrimmage. On second down, same result.
In came rookie fullback Noah Reimers to try his luck on third-and-goal. Seconds later, Reimers was in the end zone for the third time that night, and the rout was complete. Behind six rushing touchdowns from three different players, the Harvard football team (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) continued its impressive 2015 campaign on a chilly Friday night, dismantling Georgetown (2-3) for its 17th-straight win, 45-0.
If the Georgetown defensive seven’s mantra was to bend and not break, that certainly didn’t hold against the Crimson’s stalwart offensive line. Whether it was senior running back Paul Stanton, Reimers, or Holdway in the backfield, Crimson rushers routinely found clean running lanes, forcing the Hoyas to make the tough open-field tackles or tack another seven points on the ever-mounting deficit.
“This is as good an offensive line as we’ve ever had here,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You put those three seniors, Adam Redmond, Cole Toner, and Anthony Fabiano, and tremendous athletes, they’ve all started about 30 games apiece…. That’s the heart and soul of our offense. If you have a great offensive line, you can do a lot of things.”
Stanton continued his ascent in the Crimson record books, surpassing Treavor Scales ’13 and Mike Giardi ’94 after his first touchdown Friday night to take the sole second-place slot in career rushing touchdowns with 30. The senior tallied 113 yards on the ground along with two scores, including a 37-yard dash down the sideline. Friday night marked the 10th-consecutive game that Stanton has found the end zone for the Crimson.
After taking a 31-0 lead to end the first half, Murphy elected to save Stanton’s legs, and Reimers shouldered much of the rushing load for the remainder of the game. The freshman took advantage of the support of a veteran offensive line to record 64 yards as well as three touchdowns.
“[Reimers] is a hard worker, great kid, so I’m just really excited that he’s flourished so quickly,” Stanton said.
NO LUCK FOR NOLAN
While Crimson quarterback Scott Hosch enjoyed pass protection that hasn’t allowed a sack yet in 2015, Georgetown play-caller Kyle Nolan wasn’t as fortunate.
Early in the second quarter, Nolan, flushed out of the pocket by three red jerseys, scrambled and tried to throw the ball away, but junior defensive end Miles McCollum was too fast. McCollum stripped the ball from Nolan, and captain Matt Koran was there for the easy recovery. Less than two minutes later, Harvard capitalized on the turnover, and the lead increased to 24 as Reimers plowed into the end zone.
The Hoyas moved the chains just 11 times on the night, and the Crimson defense made sure that each first down was hard earned, bringing pressure from the front seven or throwing corner blitzes at Nolan on each third down. Georgetown converted on just 27 percent of its third downs, and the Hoyas’ punter got a workout, punting the ball eight times for 259 yards—37 more yards than the visiting squad’s offense.
“Coach puts us in the right position to rush the quarterback on third-and-long or whatever it may be,” said senior defensive end James Duberg. “Definitely chalk a lot of it up to the coaching and putting it in the right place.”
SO CLOSE YET SO FAR
Down by just three points in the first quarter, the Hoyas appeared poised to at least even up the score. After a 34-yard kickoff return, Georgetown began its second drive near midfield, and Nolan moved the squad down to the Harvard 35-yard line.
But on third down, Nolan’s screen pass to running back Jo’el Kimpela wasn’t enough for the first down, and on the ensuing fourth down, Kimpela found himself wrapped up in the backfield by Koran on a failed option play for a turnover on downs.
The Hoyas’ next possession—now down 10 points after Hosch and company marched down the field, this time completing the drive with a Stanton touchdown—didn’t fare much better. Fueled by a 40-yard dash from Kimpela, Georgetown drove down from its own 25 to Harvard’s 25-yard line before stalling at a 4th-and-14.
With the squad just out of field goal range, Georgetown coach Rob Sgarlata elected to attempt the long conversion. The Hoyas moved the ball down just three of the required 14 yards but caught a break when sophomore linebacker Luke Hutton was called for an illegal use of hands penalty, and 4th-and-14 became 4th-and-1. This time, Sgarlata sent out his field goal unit, but the kicker missed wide left, and Georgetown remained scoreless.
“When you stop a team that early in the game, you can see it in their expressions, body language, everything,” Duberg said. “To get a stop like that two times in a row, it’s unbelievable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Crimson opened the scoring under the lights of Reese Stadium against Yale in 2013, Harvard men’s soccer coach Pieter Lehrer appeared to be well on his way to a win in his Ivy League coaching debut up a goal with less than five minutes to play.
But with two unanswered scores, the Bulldogs played spoiler, handing Lehrer the first conference loss of his Crimson tenure.
As of Saturday night, Yale skipper Kylie Stannard now has a story to match.
Coaching in his first career Ancient Eight matchup, Stannard watched his side jump out to an early edge just seven minutes into the game. But three unanswered Harvard goals, including a deciding header from senior forward Jake Freeman, lifted the Crimson (2-4-2, 1-0-0 Ivy) to a 3-1 victory over the Bulldogs (1-7-0, 0-1-0) at Reese Stadium.
With the score even at one in the 63rd minute, Freeman put the finishing touch on an attack which saw eight Harvard players touch the ball in less than 30 seconds. After the flurry of passes, senior midfielder Michael Klain broke free from his defender on the right wing, giving him room to launch a cross into the box.
Seeing the separation, Freeman crashed the net, and Klain dipped a cross in his direction toward the near post. From there, Freeman lowered his head and tucked the ball just inside the pipe, leaving rookie goaltender Kees Schipper with no time to react.
“Jake’s run was superb,” senior striker Tim Schmoll said. “Jake’s absolutely stepped up big time as a leader on this team. He’s very calm and poised on the field. He really is someone who doesn’t let the context of the game get to him and just knows what he’s good at. And that was textbook Jake, that goal.”
Freeman aggravated his knee on the play, forcing him to leave the game. But not before the senior got a chance to celebrate—karate-kicking the corner flag in the aftermath of the game-winner.
“My whole leg went numb,” Freeman said. “But my adrenaline kind of just took me. I had to celebrate.”
Without Freeman—as well as co-captain defenseman Mark Ashby, who has missed all eight games this season due to injury, the Crimson managed to stave off any chance of a Yale comeback, holding the hosts to just one shot on net in the second half.
Harvard sealed the deal with 1:32 remaining. Waiting for a long ball to land inside the box, senior forward Oliver White barreled into the extended left leg of Bulldog captain defender Philip Piper, sending both players crashing to the ground.
The collision prompted the referee to point to the spot. Schmoll then stepped up and drilled the penalty into the bottom left corner of the net to cap a two-goal win—marking the first time in eight years that the two sides have been separated by more than one goal.
Yale got out to a near-perfect start, finding the back of the net off sophomore midfielder Archie Kinnane’s corner kick under seven minutes in. Kinnane drove a pass on the ground to junior midfielder Henry Albrecht inside the box, who sent his first touch to space, where only rookie midfielder Nicky Downs could get to it.
On his first touch, Downs curled a shot from the top of the 18-yard box into the top right corner of the net for his first career goal off what Schmoll called a “well-crafted set piece.”
“It wasn’t something that we had seen them do, so I think we were a bit taken aback by that certainly,” Schmoll said. “But it did not change our game plan whatsoever.”
The Bulldogs’ lead lasted for less than seven minutes, as Freeman also helped produce the Crimson’s equalizer. Getting his head on a Schipper goal kick, Freeman sent the ball right back in the keeper’s direction, prompting him to vacate his net in pursuit of the ball.
But with White attacking hard, the ball never ended up reaching Schipper. Piper tried to poke a pass to his keeper, but the ball slid right past him and into the net, marking the beginning of a night to forget for the Yale captain and a night to remember for Freeman.

Life is full of change. Semesters end in the blink of an eye, friends come and go, and my future career options change with every week. Change is good, I’m told, and I’ve come to accept this.
However, I cannot keep up Harvard’s constantly evolving political stance on grass in the Yard.
You see, I grew up in Sunny Florida, home to old people, alligators, and copious amounts of venezuelan food. Florida has warm weather year-long, so our grass stays green even during the worst of winter.
Harvard, however, seems to be unable to make up its mind as to the grass in the yard. One week, Harvard is using ‘organic’ fertilizer—probably just poop mixed with old plants—to encourage grass growth. Then the next week, Harvard does something to hurt its grass.
Two weeks ago, for example, I was walking to my class in Sever when I noticed a loud machine drilling holes into the grass in Tercentenary Theatre. Why? Good question. I’m no expert in grassology, but I expect Harvard just really hates grass and was trying to hurt its feelings.
Then, just last week, esteemed Flyby writer Kyle E. O’Hara ’18 snapped this picture of violence being inflicted upon a poor, unassuming patch of grass.
We talk a lot about socioeconomic inequality at Harvard, but we should also talk about how Harvard unevenly favors some grass plots over others. Take a look at this gross example of shameless favoritism:
Harvard, this Reign of Terror has to stop. All grass is created equal, and obvious displays of hatred or favoritism will be met with resistance.
The truth will come out eventually.

It has already been some eight months since Harvard got its first Snapchat filter. Since then we’ve seen some really exciting additions to Snapchat (read: we’ve seen everyone and their mother puke rainbows). I am all for watching failed Snap videos of friends raising eyebrows with no spectacles appearing, but wouldn’t it look so much better with a brand new Harvard filter? Wouldn’t it be nice to have a new and hip way to remind your friends which East Coast Ivy League you attend? Probably not, because that aging spectacle filter flatters no one and probably offends all old people, but it’s worth a shot.
If This Is CS50, then make some new Harvard Snapchat filters. We just need David Malan et al. to stop wasting precious coding hours taking staff selfies and start working their Javascript magic on Snap filters. Here are some ideas I’ve come up with:
1. The 12 Houses – It’s simple, but nothing screams house pride more than showing off your house’s new filter in a Snap story. It could become like the next IM competition. And think of how much it could enhance people’s drunk housing day selfies! Think about the day-to-day potential: want to grab lunch with some friends? Send a mass snapchat with your location, and someone will be sure to show up.
2. The Big Three – Pee on John Harvard, run Primal Scream, have sex in the Widener stacks; the Big 3 have potential for some new snap filters in the Yard. Plus, it’ll make invitations to the stacks so much less confrontational.
3. The Pilgrim – Most colleges have mascots, so most colleges have mascots in their Snap filters. According to Google, “John Harvard, the pilgrim” is our mascot, so either turn that into something cool, or create some hip new Crimson mascot.
4. Crimson - Speaking of our lack of a real mascot, why not create an exorbitant Ivy League filter that really gets the message across that you are a real-life student at Harvard? Our current filter is a little unglamorous, and nothing says “oldest college in America” like a pretentious filter to match.
