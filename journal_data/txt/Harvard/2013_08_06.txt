After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to members of the Ivy League media, the Harvard football team will finish the upcoming season in the same spot it ended 2012: second place.
Although the Crimson received five first-place votes in the annual media poll released Tuesday, its 121 points were not enough to push it over top-ranked Penn. The defending Ancient Eight champs amassed eight more points than Harvard.
“Regardless of where they are, [the Quakers] find a way to be extremely tough, extremely physical, and extremely competitive,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They’re coming off a tremendous run with a great senior class last year and another great senior class this year. To pick them first, I think that makes a lot of sense.”
It’s not just Harvard and Penn that were predicted to repeat their 2012 performances – the ranking of the top six teams in the preseason poll were identical to the end-of-season standings last year. According to the poll, Brown will finish in third, though it did receive one first-place vote. Following the Bears are Dartmouth and Princeton, with Cornell slotted behind them in sixth.
The only change is a reversal in the bottom two slots of the conference, where Yale is predicted to finish seventh followed by Columbia in the bottom spot.
Harvard finished with an 8-2 record last season and went 5-2 against Ivy League opponents. The de facto conference championship came against Penn in the penultimate game of the season, when the Quakers outlasted the Crimson to seize a 30-21 victory. Harvard’s other defeat came at Princeton when the Tigers shocked their opponents by scoring 29 points in the final 12 minutes at play.
The Crimson will face off against Penn on Nov. 16. A week later, Harvard will end its season in New Haven with the 130th playing of The Game. Nonconference matchups include a trip west to take on San Diego in the first game of the year, a contest with Holy Cross, and a home game against Lafayette.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Allston Task Force debated aspects of Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for Allston development at its meeting Monday evening, with some residents and task force members questioning whether the University’s construction projects will have a positive short-term impact on Barry’s Corner.
The University has pledged to revitalize the quiet intersection, which sits at the crossing of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue.
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident who sits on the task force, expressed skepticism that Harvard will be able to revive Barry’s Corner in the next five years because several planned projects in the area are not scheduled for completion until years later.
“The incredible location [that we want is]...not coming in five years,” Mattison said. “It might be coming in 10 years, it might be coming in 50 years, but if this is an important area to us, and if we’re still going to view this as the hub and focal point in our new place where the University and the neighborhood are going to meet...we need to think of something to do.”
Mattison’s comments followed a presentation from Harvard detailing its master plan, which outlines nine projects the University intends to implement in the next 10 years. Residents have a 60-day period to submit comment on the master plan, which the University submitted to the Boston city government last month and hopes to have approved in October.
At Monday’s meeting, task force members and residents also expressed concern about traffic congestion in Barry’s Corner and the neighborhood more broadly.
Brent C. Whelan ’73, a  task force member who lives in Allston, criticized the University’s decision not to include in its 10-year plan “Stadium Way,” a road that would connect Harvard’s proposed science district with Barry’s Corner.
The road, which was proposed in 2007 as part of Harvard’s since-downsized 50-year plan for Allston development, remains part of the University’s long-term vision for the neighborhood. But Whelan said that delaying that development “is setting up an almost inevitable congestion.”
In response to the criticism about the immediate future of Barry’s Corner, Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that there will be other improvements to the area in the next few years, including road improvements and green space accompanying the projects. By way of example, he cited the planned construction of a grove of trees in Barry’s Corner.
“It is true that our IMP is about nine projects and renovations, but those include those things that come with it,” Casey said.
Residents also raised several other concerns about elements of the master plan, such as the proposed basketball arena and what they described as a large amount of planned parking space.
Although the meeting featured sometimes heated criticism of the master plan, Tim McHale, a Brighton resident who sits on the task force, called the master plan “pretty well thought-out” and “really impressive.”
“It’s a lot of years of work, and I think Harvard needs some acknowledgement that they’ve done a good job,” McHale said. “Now, we have a lot of concerns with it…but as a document it turned out really well.”
Christina L. Marin, a task force member, also expressed some optimism about the planning going forward. She wrote in an email after the meeting that “the neighborhood will go through some growing pains as it transitions into the community we all envision.”
“Many of us are looking forward to the neighborhood that Allston can become,” Marin wrote. “Right now, we are looking to minimize the impact of construction and ensure even the minor details in the Institutional Master Plan have been thought through.”
In future meetings, the task force plans to move forward with further discussion of the master plan and possible community benefits, including transportation and education. Weekly meetings are planned through early October.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard football team is the highest ranked Ivy in the FCS Coaches Preseason Poll, which was released Tuesday. The Crimson received 48 points as the 29th highest vote-getter. Despite winning the Ancient Eight last year and starting this season as the Ivy favorite, Penn received just 13 points in the poll.
 
Harvard also finished ahead of the Quakers in the poll at the end of last season. The Crimson was slotted 27th with 60 points, five slots higher than Penn, which received seven points in the Jan. 7 release.
 
The only other Ivy squad to garner a vote in the 2013 poll was Brown. The Bears, which were also the only other team to get a first-place Ivy vote, received one point.
 
Harvard’s first opponent of the year, the University of San Diego, got two points in the poll. The Crimson will face the Toreros Sep. 21. No other Crimson opponent got a vote.
