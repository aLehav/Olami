'Modern Family'
Another year means another sweep during awards season for ABC’s “Modern Family,” which recently picked up three Primetime Emmys out of six nominations. The mockumentary sitcom about a multigenerational family living in suburban Los Angeles will begin its sixth season on Sept. 24. Although a lesser show this far into its lifespan might be content to coast, “Modern Family” embarks on its new season fresh off some of its best episodes, such as season five favorite “Las Vegas,” a delightful comedy of errors which masterfully controls the chaos and misunderstandings of its narrative. After Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) were married in the two-part season five finale, season six kicks off straight into their honeymoon. Meanwhile, Steve Zahn (“A Perfect Getaway,” “Dallas Buyers Club”) joins the cast as Ronnie, the patriarch of the hellish new family next door.
'The Legend of Korra'
After the heart-shattering finale of Book Three: Change, “The Legend of Korra” returns to Nickelodeon on Oct. 3 for its final season, Book 4: Balance. A sequel to “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” the show is set 70 years after the events of the original series and features a new Avatar named Korra (Janet Varney). Despite being an animated children’s show, “Korra” has gained a massive cult following among older viewers for its high production value and moral complexity, so much that Nickelodeon is exclusively distributing the final season online. After a tumultuous fight that left major antagonists dead and Korra emotionally traumatized, the haunting final shot of Book 3 lingers on a close-up of Korra at a celebration, motionless in a wheelchair, a tear rolling down her face. The arrival of Book 4 will likely bring balance to Korra’s world, and showrunners Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino have teased a tweaked character design for Korra’s recovery.
'Bob’s Burgers'
Fresh off its first Emmy win and a guest-star studded season, “Bob’s Burgers” returns to the small screen for its fifth season on Oct. 5. The animated series portrays the lives of the middle-class Belcher family, who live above a burger restaurant owned by patriarch Bob. Its upcoming season continues the show’s tradition of featuring complex and idiosyncratic one-off characters, with Bill Hader, Zach Galifianakis, Nick Offerman, Jordan Peele, and Keegan Michael Key all set to make guest appearances. Bolstered by consistently strong writing and non sequitur musical numbers, “Bob’s Burgers” is reminiscent of “The Simpsons” at its peak yet still maintains a completely unique atmosphere. The season five premiere, “Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl,” depicts a conflict between oldest Belcher child Tina (Dan Mintz), who performs in a school musical inspired by “Working Girl,” and middle child Gene (Eugene Mirman), who produces a competing underground production of a “Die Hard”-inspired musical.
'The Walking Dead'
With last year’s conclusion of “Breaking Bad” and the imminent finale of “Mad Men,” AMC’s “The Walking Dead” is slated to become the network’s lone powerhouse scripted drama when its new season premieres this fall on Oct.12. Based on a series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, the show follows protagonist Sheriff Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and an ensemble cast of 16 other series regulars as they struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by the undead. The new season promises important plot developments and a resolution to the previous season’s cliffhanger, which left Rick and gang trapped inside a storage container by a malicious group of strangers (and potential cannibals). More importantly, the new season teases revelations about the source of the zombie plague in addition to a potential cure, while the survivors travel to Washington, D.C., for some much-needed answers.
'Parks and Recreation'
The seven season saga of Leslie Knope finally comes to an end this fall. “Parks and Recreation” begins its final season after a three year time skip in the previous season’s finale, which depicted a post-pregnancy Leslie (Amy Poehler) happily working at her National Parks job in Pawnee while raising triplets with Ben (Adam Scott). Filming for the final season began in August, with a premiere set for later this fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zaneta H. Hong, lecturer in landscape architecture, calls the central studio in Gund Hall the “heart” of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and for someone regarding the space for the first time, the description holds true. The space is dominated by a five-tiered collection of desks, each one designated for a specific graduate student’s personal use. A clear span roof and large windows let in rays of light that seem to emphasize the concept of the studio as the core of design education.
Behind the central studio, however, a much smaller, much less formidable space serves as a classroom for a small group of students. This is the HILT Room, a new space at GSD meant to revolutionize how design is taught. The acronym refers to the group that funded the space: the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching. While it is located in Gund Hall, the HILT Room primarily serves undergraduates—specifically, those pursuing the new architecture studies track in the History of Art and Architecture Department.
Established in 2012 and administered by both the HAA Department and GSD, the architecture studies track is itself divided into two branches: history and theory, and design studies. The former emphasizes the study of the history of architecture; the latter, contemporary theories and applications of design. K. Michael Hays, a professor of architectural theory and associate dean for academic affairs at GSD, believes that the establishment of the architecture studies track filled a conspicuous gap in the liberal arts curriculum at Harvard. “[The HAA Department and GSD] have often talked about how disappointing it was that Harvard, who has one of the strongest and progressive liberal arts curriculum, never saw architecture as a liberal arts pursuits,” Hays says.
Still, Hays admits, the nature of architecture as an academic discipline makes it difficult to teach in the non-pre-professional context of a liberal arts college. “Because architecture has a very technical dimension, to teach it as a liberal arts study requires a little more effort,” he says. To address this challenge, the track forged a unique connection with the GSD. “What we decided was that by doing a jointly administered program, we would bring the expertise of both departments to bear.”
Students and faculty members associated with the track acknowledge that close ties to a profession, as well as to the pre-professional program at GSD, make it difficult for the program to strike a balance between the academic study of architecture and its technical application. But the achievements of the fledgling track suggest that the struggle yields success. Since its establishment, the program has provided a niche for students whose interest in architecture had previously been unaddressed by the college, and has served as a frontier for the promotion of a philosophy that seeks to broaden people’s ideas about the scope and application of architectural knowledge.
OFFICE SPACE
At just three years old, Harvard’s architecture studies track is quite young compared to those at most other institutions. Two T-stops away in Kendall Square, the MIT School of Architecture and Planning boasts five tracks within its undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Architecture program. The five-year Bachelor of Architecture program for undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. These undergraduate architecture programs all feature a studio component—the aspect of Harvard’s architecture studies track that sets it apart from the rest of the HAA Department.
In addition to architecture-related classes in the HAA Department, both branches of the track require students to take two architecture studio courses at GSD: Architecture Studio 1: “Transformations” and Architecture Studio 2: “Connections.” But Professor Hong is adamant that studio courses do not a pre-professional program make. “It’s just meant to give a very enlightened preview of what an architecture program should be,” she says.
The logistics seem to support Hong’s opinion; the studio courses required by the architecture studies track only meet for six hours per week—half the time of most studio courses at GSD and of those at most nationally accredited undergraduate programs.
Hong, who teaches “Transformations,” says the studio utilizes diagrams and models to help students acquire a perspective crucial for understanding design. “Transformations” is really about developing certain knowledge and language that’s found in architecture,” Hong says. “The way that we do this is through visualization…. A lot of the products that you see from the studio are a lot of physical models, and these physical models are meant to engage a lot of larger architectural concepts—pattern, density, flow.”
According to Hong, the studio courses also provide students with the opportunity to learn the language, the terminology, and the methodology of architectural design. In her opinion, this kind of knowledge provides a solid foundation for a career in architecture, if it is what the student wants, but is by no means valuable only for this purpose.
Jeremy Ficca, an associate professor of architecture at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture, agrees that studio time is essential to understanding architecture on a technical as well as a theoretical level. “[Studio work] begins to establish a way and an instrument to address ideas through the design process. Quite literally, the students are working on projects that become the vehicle to explore ideas,” Ficca says. “The studio is generally understood as being the backbone...the place through which you can...bring what you’re learning in other classes to bear on the ideas that you’re exploring in the design studio.”
For Alaina R. Murphy ’14, the required studio classes were the highlight of the track. “[Studio class] was the defining thing that made it architecture studies instead of HAA,” she says. “I personally wish I had time to do more [studio classes], and I wish there were more offered. One [class that I took] was a construction studio—we were in the GSD and physically making things every week…. We had to use computer software and our own drawings, and in the end we had to produce a structure. We got to use tools, use our hands, and that was something really special.”
Stella Fiorenzoli ’15 would also have welcomed more studio time. “I love to make things, I love to draw, I love the hands-on experiences,” she says. “That ability to go to the GSD and make those things has been met by Harvard negatively. It’s taken as being too pre-professional, but I wish we had more of those experiences.”
For students like Murphy and Fiorenzoli, the pre-professional bent of the architecture studies track, far from undermining its legitimacy, is an asset. In Fiorenzoli’s case, the studio component was the deciding factor that led her to pursue the track. “The studio courses and the ability to make something that comes from yourself...[provide] proof of the theories you learn,” she says. “If the architecture track didn’t have those things, I wouldn’t have applied [to the program].”
BUILDING A RESUME
Architecture studies student Benjamin Lopez ’15 believes that the program’s attempt to reconcile theoretical and technical components has led to deficiency in the latter. “I expected a lot of my courses to be heavily design based and project based so you could build a portfolio,” Lopez says. “I was hoping to come out of Harvard with a few more projects, but what I found was the track doesn’t have too many design courses.”
Though Lopez does not intend to pursue a career as an architect, he is doubtful as to whether his undergraduate experiences would have provided sufficient preparation for an MArch program. “If you want to be an architect and have a comprehensive architecture education, Harvard is not the best place,” he says. “I feel that I don’t have the comprehensive skill sets a lot of students at competing schools do have…. Architecture programs and employers want to see what you’ve done, not your classes.”
But how helpful a pre-professional undergraduate program is for aspiring architects remains unclear. According to Renée A. Caso, administrator for academic programs in the MIT Architecture Department, the criteria for admittance into the MIT MArch program are flexible. “I often see and notice that a lot of the students who apply and get into the program do not come from architecture programs,” she says. Caso also stresses that securing admission into a graduate program should not be the only goal of an undergraduate program in architecture studies. “To help students really decide whether or not [architecture] is the direction they want to go in is as equally important as training them for...an MArch program,” she says.
For some Harvard undergraduates, the architecture studies track has achieved this second objective, providing them with clarity about their professional ambitions and reaffirming their love for design. Murphy’s post-graduate experiences make clear that this love need not manifest in the form of a career as an architect. Since graduating in June as part of the first group to complete the track, Murphy has started working at Touch Of Modern, a startup that sells modern design items. “I knew after college that I wanted to be in the design world, but I didn’t know if I wanted to go to the graduate school,” Murphy says. “But one gap that I knew that I had in my knowledge of design was...design in terms of money.” While Murphy’s career has led her away from architecture, she cites her undergraduate studies as being influential in her job choice. “The concentration definitely secured my desire to be surrounded by design and to learn more about it,” she says.
ONE HARVARD
In addition to raising questions about the place of pre-professional studies at a liberal arts college, the required studio component of the architecture track necessitates close ties to GSD. The workshops and materials used by architecture track undergraduates were once used almost exclusively by graduate students. While the undergraduate track undoubtedly benefits from the wealth of resources available via the school, the connection between the track and the graduate school is not devoid of complications.
“Our interactions with the GSD are the highlight, but it’s not so fluid and seamless as it would seem,” Lopez says. “I wish we were more immersed in graduate classes, [and] I think we should take more…. The GSD is definitely opening their doors, [but] I guess you just get greedy and ambitious and wish the doors were more open.”
Fiorenzoli is thankful for the relationship between GSD and the History of Art and Architecture Department. “The whole environment gave me a really nice glimpse into the graduate school for architecture,” she says—a glimpse that has strongly influenced her decision to apply to graduate design school. However, she characterizes her personal connection to GSD and the HAA Department as unequal and acknowledges that the imbalance can be problematic. “I’ve made some really close connections with faculty at the GSD but less so with the HAA Department,” she says. “When I was looking at who would be my senior adviser for my thesis, I didn’t really know anyone at Harvard.”
Hays, too, admits that a seamless connection between GSD and the architecture studies track has been difficult to achieve. “[President Drew Faust] had a slogan...of ‘One Harvard,’” he says. “Her plan has been to bring together the different schools, including the graduate schools and the different departments in the College…. Despite the power of that plan, there’s such a built-in inertia to the institution.”
According to Hays, this inertia also contributed to the difficulty of making the architecture track a reality—an roughly three-year process that required an intensive approval process and concerted efforts on the part of both GSD and HAA faculty members. “The school as an institution has policies made to resist…connections and innovations,” Hays says. “It took a group of faculty working from the ground up and pushing it through the FAS processes…. There was a lot of emphasis on the combined efforts of two schools.”
ARCHITECTURE AS A MINDSET
Though many architecture studies students seem to view the track as a means of realizing a career in design, Hays is adamant that the program aligns with Harvard’s commitment to providing undergraduates with a liberal arts education—one that does not feed into a specific career. For Hays, architecture is not merely a discipline but a mindset. To study architecture is to develop a way of thinking and of seeing the world that is distinct from that cultivated by other areas of study.
“Architects learn different ways of representing data. We can represent data in a very graphic way rather than numerically and textually,” he says. “Imagine someone going into biology with the ability to represent the interaction of complex systems in a different way than a normal biologist would represent it…. It would expand the kind of way you can learn about things. The hope is that [studying architecture] will contribute to an expanding potential of thoughts in other fields.”
Professor Ficca agrees that the study of architecture has implications far beyond the acquisition of technical, applicable knowledge. “I know it’s a very simplistic analogy saying [architecture] is the merging of the arts and sciences, but despite being a technical field of study and practice, it is implicitly a cultural act.”
Fiorenzoli affirms that the study of architecture informs and is connected to other areas of study. A joint concentrator in music and architecture studies, Fiorenzoli sees the disciplines as deeply connected and is currently at work on a thesis that combines the two. “Architecture and music have very similar languages,” she says. “Architects will often talk about the rhythm to a façade—how quickly you eyes move across a facade, what are the pattern of the movements on the building, how do they interact…. The two worlds are definitely related in that sense.”
Meanwhile, Abigail Harris ’16 hopes that her design training will enable her to combine her interest in architecture and her secondary in women, gender, and sexuality studies in a socially impactful way. “In WGS, we see that all institutions are constructed by…heteronormativity,” Harris says. “I’m interested in seeing how we can construct some of those social implications in our designs.”
CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGE
Ambitious philosophy aside, the architecture track is young, and students and faculty members alike acknowledge that there is room for improvement. Harris feels the track still doesn’t have a specific focus and lacks complete definition.“I wish that I wouldn’t be such a newbie to the program because it’s definitely only getting up and running, and the classes that we have to take aren’t exactly defined,” she says. “Right now, I don’t have a really specific focus on my architecture studies.”
Hong cites a variety of ways in which the track could be improved: “There needs to be a much larger infrastructure, more staff, more student interest.”
Yet, students find plenty to praise about the track—notably, its tight-knit community and the specificity with which the program caters to their interests. Harris admits that the existence of the track cemented her decision to go to Harvard. She had been considering Princeton, which is well known for its undergraduate program in architecture, but chose to attend Harvard after discovering that the architecture studies track was being implemented.
Also attractive to students is the relatively small size of the track—out of the 70 sophomores that declared HAA concentrations last November, nine opted for architecture studies. This results in smaller classes and more personalized teaching. Lopez recounts a time when the students expressed disappointment that none of the course offerings for a particular semester dealt with modern art. Hays heeded their complaints and was able to implement a new course about modern architecture for the following semester.
Additionally, students are excited by how the newness of the track enables them to have a real impact on its development. “That ability to control what will happen for the next generation—that is something I’m very thankful for," Fiorenzoli says.
It is this commitment to improvement that breeds positivity about the track’s future. Hays hopes the track can expand beyond architecture into urban and landscape studies. Fiorenzoli, too, has a grand vision for it. “I see it as being its own concentration,” she says. “I see it expanding in numbers full of students who come here knowing that there is an architecture track, knowing there is a space for them.”
Even as it endures growing pains, the architecture studies track seems to be in the midst of a multifaceted bloom, simultaneously opening Harvard’s doors to students who might previously not have felt that the school’s definition of liberal arts included a place for them, and encouraging the development of a different way of thinking about the nature of architecture. “Right now, architecture is a profession,” Hays says. “I would like to define it more as a discipline and a mode of knowledge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first, it’s tempting to dismiss “On Bittersweet Place” by Ronna Wineberg as one of the numerous Jewish immigrant novels that have been published in recent years. It is a coming-of-age account of Lena Czernitski, a young Russian Jew whose family fled Ukraine after the October Revolution. After an arduous journey to Poland, Lena and her family finally resettle in Chicago, where misfortune seems to beleaguer them constantly. Although the plot seems standard for an immigrant book, “On Bittersweet Place” largely escapes cliché through the protagonist’s incredibly endearing voice. With Lena’s narrative, the book becomes instantly relatable. “On Bittersweet Place” persuades the reader to stay until the end—and to root for Lena through her ups and downs.
Perhaps the greatest strength of “On Bittersweet Place” is its simple prose, which makes the book easily accessible. Oftentimes, a book is written from a child’s perspective yet is narrated in an embellished, complicated voice. However, this novel maintains a straightforward voice, one that Lena could have had. This prose not only renders the story more compelling but is also appropriate for one of Lena’s bigger struggles: communicating boldly with those around her. At one point her uncle rapes her, and Lena reports having lost her voice. “I had been losing it ever since we left Russia, and now that I’d felt my uncle’s cold hands on my skin I could no longer speak from my heart.” As the reader knows about Lena’s struggle to stand up for herself, the book reads almost like a diary—a child reporting her intimate, unfiltered thoughts. In addition to her thoughts, the book reproduces the mental lists that Lena creates, which further engage the reader. Her lists have titles such as “My Fears” and “What I Want,” with items like “I will fail in school—and no one will help me.” These simple and vulnerable feelings are powerful, and draw the reader more intensely into Lena’s story.
Among her relationships with those around her, the most complicated is Lena’s relationship with her parents. At first, Lena views her mother in a frustrated, almost resentful manner. For Lena, her mother represents everything that was left behind in Ukraine: the constant longing for the past, for something that cannot be restored. Lena is quick to fault her mother, even when her father cheats on her. If Lena is decidedly unfair to her mother, she turns a blind eye to the faults of her father, as he comes to symbolize her life in Chicago. He speaks English and supports her drawing, the medium through which she expresses herself. The time Lena spends with each character is unbalanced: Lena seems constantly to be in conflict with her mother as they both spend time in the house, while the father is barely home. But Wineberg maneuvers the pacing so that as Lena comes to understand her mother and be more critical of her father toward the end of the book, the time she spends with each parent is more balanced. This device is effective, as the reader experiences the evolving relationships temporally as the novel progresses.
However, the story concentrates so much on Lena’s maturation at times that the immigrant conflicts seem to be forced, almost as an obligation. A mean boy at school bullies her, mocking her for her heritage. Her teacher turns out to have been unfair to her due to racism. Her boyfriend Max’s father changes the name of his laundry shop to hide his Jewish heritage. In comparison to her coming-of-age story, her immigrant status seems to matter only marginally. Only the constant Yiddish phrases and sentences, followed by the English translation right afterwards, effectively unite the coming-of-age story with struggles of a young Russian Jewish girl.
But the more disappointing aspect of the novel is its ending. After building up such a beautiful momentum of maturation through which Lena seems finally to have the courage to confront and combat her problems, the book ultimately fails to deliver on this early success. Its conclusion is overly fast-paced, and Lena’s problems seem magically to resolve on their own. The teacher who threatened to fail her in school and her Uncle Maurice disappear from Lena’s life. Max, whose love Lena has always doubted, unambiguously confirms his true feelings. The ending is clichéd and candy-wrapped. Because such a deep, intriguing narrative is sidelined by a conventional ending, “On Bittersweet Place” appears to be just what its title suggests: gratifying, but leaving a longing for something slightly more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christopher Marlowe—author of “The Jew of Malta” and “Doctor Faustus,” Shakespeare’s rival and influence, bon-vivant, spy, atheist, reputed homosexual and, worse, reputed Catholic—died in a drunken fight on May 30, 1593. After quarreling with associates over financial matters, he was stabbed above the right eye, dying (by the coroner’s account) instantly.
Marlowe’s own beliefs and habits are the matter of ultimately irresoluble historical controversy. For the critic, however, the questions about Marlowe’s person are subordinate to the question of whether or not Marlowe, the author, is relevant to the interpretation of his work. New Historicism, with its niggling concern for ever-more minute details of authors’ lives and these details’ effects, has reigned as a preeminent critical school for some 30 years, and, as its proponents delve into what seem to be increasingly unsure waters—did the reading of Lucretius really start the Renaissance, after all?—it seems that the time is ripe for a reexamination of the question. It is this question that Éric Chevillard examines in his new novel, “The Author and Me,” translated into fine workmanlike English by Jordan Stump. Purportedly setting out to prove the independence of the voices of narrator and character from their originator, he presents a haunting argument for the inescapability of the author.
A foreword sets out Chevillard’s reputed intentions. After the publication of an earlier work, “Demolishing Nisard” (“Démolir Nisard”), he found himself entangled in disputes with readers about the opinions of his narrator. He describes his attitude: “He [the author] is nonetheless in the habit of mocking—oh, the many things he mocks!—those novelists who claim that their characters suddenly spring to life and escape their control…. The real phenomenon, which does actually happen, is entirely different: it’s rather the author who finds himself snatched up by his fiction.” He then declares his project: “This cannot go on. The author has his pride, and his autonomy. He stands before you determined to keep his distance from the narrator of his new book, to distinguish himself from him as sharply as he can, and thus to hold fast to his mastery.”
To this end, in addition to the voice of his narrator, he adds his own voice as the “author” by means of footnotes commenting on what the narrator is saying (especially to note contrasts between himself and his narrator) as well as the voice of the young lady whom the narrator accosts in a cafe and to whom he pours out his story. Her comments are interspersed within the text in italicized parentheses. The narrator is defined primarily for his love of trout amandine and his loathing for cauliflower gratin, which lead him to murderous excesses.
Two points arise in opposition to this project. First, much of the author’s time becomes absorbed in describing and distinguishing himself from his creation, so much that this description acquires a life of its own and subsumes an enormous portion of the novel: of the 141 pages, 42 are spent on a single footnote describing the author’s life, which begins with a cheeky declaration: “Surely there can be no better way for the author to ensure his mastery and to stand up to his character than to drag him out of his soliloquy by one ear and cast him without warning into another fiction.” The author’s words always bend toward his own experience, as is especially evident in the his discussion of his religious experience, when the narrator’s utterance, “My God!” leads to an extended footnote on the author’s Catholic upbringing.  Second, and more subtly, is not defining a narrator (or any other character) in opposition to the self of the author a true separation of the two, or is it just another determinism? Does one paint the light by painting the shadows? On the narrator’s utterance, “...take that…bitch!…you like it, you know you like it…!” the author comments, “Never would the author have written such a thing.”  But writing a thing because one would “never” write it is being as obedient to external stimuli as writing a thing because it is the sort of thing one writes.
Chevillard’s project is very important, but he retains a wonderful humor that prevents it from dropping to the valleys of pomposity that many of his postmodern brethren populate. His narrator in one instance declares, “If all cauliflower and even all memory of cauliflower were abruptly to vanish from the face of this earth—O miracle!—then, I swear, I would don mourning clothes of red and gold, with a pointy hat and a party whistle unrolling from my lips with every breath.” Regardless of the direct importance of the author, his humor is preeminent in Chevillard’s vision.
While asserting the conventional modern critical opinion that the author cannot be separated from his text, Chevillard probes the question with a discernment that cannot be attributed to the hordes of petty Historicists who treat authors like computers, with straightforward biographical inputs leading to straightforward literary outputs. “The Author and Me,” with its insights into the interactions and even struggles between the creator and his creation, should be required reading for every would-be student of literature in this generation.

Electronic musician Richard James, who primarily records under the moniker of Aphex Twin, hasn’t released a single since 1999. But judging from “minipop 67,” the lead single off the upcoming “Syro,” it might be impossible to tell. The beat is a little less aggressive than we’re used to hearing from Aphex Twin, but the momentum, vocoded vocals, and barely tonal melodic lines all carry over from his previous discography and make their mark on “minipops 67”—perhaps because the single is one of the older tracks on “Syro,” dating back seven or eight years.
Employing his old tricks nearly one-and-a-half decades since his last LP, James carefully interlaces augmented and minor modes to create a harmonic push and pull that competes with the labyrinthine but steadfast rhythmic pattern for dominance over the track. James has carefully crafted entire albums in this way before—tracks that supply energy transition into tracks that consume it, polarizing the album into moments of dynamism and stasis. However, “minipops 67” is neither a “Cock/Ver10” nor an “Avril 14th” but contains elements of both, the soft synths and intimate vocals rubbing warmly against the scattered, unrelenting percussion.
“minipops 67” is an appropriate track to reintroduce Aphex Twin after 14 years of silence. It showcases the electronic composer’s often overlooked ear for harmony while breathing life into an upcoming album that now promises to stay true to his discography. For many years, James has experimented with combining his sounds in new ways, and with “minipops 67,” he seems to be suggesting more of the same on “Syro.”
“Syro” is out Sept. 19 via Warp Records.

The pet project of one-woman army Shara Worden, My Brightest Diamond has been out of the spotlight for several years. However, with the release of “This Is My Hand,” it’s clear that the songstress is back with a more defined sound than ever. From the moment the album’s opening snare drum line jars the senses into submission, “This Is My Hand” sports a distinct, mesmerizing sound that is both carefully constructed and spontaneous.
The lineup starts off with “Pressure,” the leading single off the release, which was accompanied by a shining, trippy, and prismatic music video. The song is catchy and surprisingly structured for an artist known for such ethereal orchestrations as 2011’s “The Sea.” The strong brass hits beginning here continue to interject with carefully balanced energy throughout the album. Also established early on is a waxing and waning pattern of intensity; Worden plays with building and removing layers of accompaniment at precisely engineered moments.
From this theatrical start, the LP progresses like a funky, modern opera. Worden’s classically styled voice directly contrasts with the modern and surreal instrumentation, but somehow the juxtaposition has the effect of emphasizing each separate part rather than supporting one at the cost of another. Still, it’s clear that although the voice and the rhythm are never at odds, Worden is always in control. Her delivery is equal parts drill sergeant and nurturing mother, a hybrid especially effective on driving-yet-cool tracks like “Before the Words” and “I Am Not the Bad Guy.” The result is a hook-filled, pulsing sound achieved without overwhelming instrumentation, maintaining creativity without becoming formulaic. It’s maximum energy for minimal orchestration.
Worden’s tight rein over her creative process surfaces as a main theme of the collection. Drawing inspiration from the world of fine art, songs explore color, shape, space, and form. Listening is like peeking into the unlocked private art studio completely absorbed in their creations. In “Pressure,” Worden gives us a run-down of the hues emanating from her musical prism: “Pink, purple, green, red, yellow, blue / I am in that mood indigo.” The album’s namesake track “This Is My Hand” is an exploration of the singer’s body through the constructive mindset of a skilled sculptor, while “Shape” captures Worden’s dreamy musings about her shape-shifting soul, swelling and fading as she declares, “You’ll never know how I may appear…You’ll never know what shape I might take, I might be the ghost or I might be hiding in smoke.”
The critically artistic eye Worden brings to the table with “This Is My Hand” is at once mature and youthfully whimsical, evidence of a creatively controlling mind with her musical ideas clearly laid out before her. The structure of the songs is ever-evolving and complex; in fact, at times the singer’s artistic vision seems to be overly dominant. Some songs are so artistically drawn-out that they come off as unfinished works, as if Worden moved on to her next great idea without defining the first. It’s a shame, because while all the songs have a strong underlying skeleton, some bare tracks are outshined by their more fleshy neighbors.
Still, her iron grip over her music comes through consistently. Her articulate, confidently composed vocals ooze control. In this surreal, operatic world of fine art set to synth-laden, calmly funky tracks, Worden is the reigning queen. Somehow, even with some individual tracks giving the listener a feeling of incompletion, the album manages to present itself as a comprehensive work. It’s a display of creativity in various forms of finality, and any more development would lessen the personal nature of the music. Its instability is no doubt far more carefully balanced than meets the ear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are increasingly studying economics, hard sciences, and computer science, leaving the humanities to suffer a widely lamented drop in popularity. Over half of the freshmen originally planning to pursue art and the humanities ultimately choose a different route, leaving under 17 percent of students concentrating in the humanities. It seems as though something they encounter during their years at Harvard—perhaps self-selection toward concentrations with greater employment opportunities, or the very culture of the University—alters their thinking.
In messages to students, the administration touts monetary gains and quantifiable scientific research as its key measures of success. In President Drew G. Faust’s end-of-the-year email in June, the only message last year’s freshmen received offering Faust’s thoughts on student life, Faust focuses on finances and scientific research results.
Art, social sciences, and the humanities are only briefly mentioned in the conclusion, and no contributions to these areas, whether research or otherwise, are mentioned. This sends to students the implicit message that the administration values these pursuits less.
The administration’s value judgments are also evident in its hesitation to provide the Undergraduate Council with $250,000 in additional funds to support student groups, club sports, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, and the Phillips Brooks House Association. UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos has pointed out that while the UC’s budget is $500,000, other colleges’ student governments control multi-million dollar budgets, and that these funding increases could dramatically enhance student life. The administration can certainly afford to spend $250,000 on extracurricular endeavors, since it allocates over $7 million annually to undergraduate students pursuing research outside the classroom. Their refusal is therefore a reflection of the administration’s view that extracurricular activities are of secondary importance.
While research is arguably generally an extension of the classroom, for some academic areas, extracurricular activities serve as their more natural expansion. For students of drama, for instance, theater productions are most relevant to their study. Literature students, on the other hand, might focus on student publications and writing competitions. Therefore, when the administration allocates its resources, it should give areas outside research due priority.
The current neglect of other fields departs from Harvard’s liberal arts objectives. The General Education requirements highlight “art, ideas, and values” as key aspects of students’ lives. And the school advertises itself as a “transformative experience” where students pursue their interests in any field to their fullest possible extent. When the administration prioritizes certain interests, it does not fulfill these objectives.
An overemphasis on scientific research harms the school’s culture. Extracurricular activities, arts, the humanities, and other related fields offer more than a diversity of opportunity on Harvard’s campus. They provide a wealth of new ideas and ways of thinking that make the community interesting and vibrant.
The remedy to this negative focus has several components. First, the administration should actively acknowledge research accomplishments in an array of fields, including the social sciences and the humanities. Second, it should recognize and encourage great moments in literature, art, and public service outside the realm of research. For instance, emails could reflect on published creative and artistic pieces, and discuss strides in public service and policy awareness made on campus.
Finally, while securing funds to further research opportunities and financial aid is critical, and the school is rightfully grateful to the donors who so generously give to the university, fundraising efforts should not define us.
We are more than our endowment. We are our culture of intellectual curiosity, our pursuit of ideas to the fullest, our belief that we can accomplish anything, and our dedication to pursuing our dreams. It is important that the administration recognizes that this, more than anything else, is what makes our school flourish.

This Thursday, there will be a referendum in Scotland to decide whether that country should leave the United Kingdom and become independent. Most Americans are only tuning in now, if it all. As a friend in New York wrote to me: “Since I'm employed by an American television news outlet, I think my official response to the Scotland thing is supposed to be: Huh?!?”
But Scotland is offering the world a way to rethink the nation-state in the 21st century—and for that reason alone, we should all be paying better attention. Unusually, the Scottish referendum has focused on issues of economic and social justice; whether voters opt for independence or not, it will be a model for other European nationalist regions and, I hope, for the United States, too.
The United Kingdom came into existence in the early modern period, when many European countries were undergoing a process of centralization around a strong state. Scotland and England shared the same monarch from 1603; just over century later in 1707, the Acts of Union formally united them under the Parliament at Westminster. In some ways, this was about imposing cultural and political hegemony, violently if necessary. But Scots found much to gain through union, too. There’s a reason we call it the British Empire and not the English Empire: Scottish men and women were among its central builders and beneficiaries. And Scotland was never entirely subsumed. Instead, for example, it retained its own distinctive legal system as well as its own state church.
The nation-state emerged as the dominant form of global political organization over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was always a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it offered political self-determination and a way to move beyond the dominance of empires. On the other hand, nationalism often seemed to fuel violence along lines of ethnicity or religion. Scotland, unlike Ireland, appeared to stand aside from this turbulent history. The Royal Family has vacationed at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire since 1852; British institutions such as the BBC and the National Health Service knitted the component parts of the UK ever closer.
Still, there were murmurs of interest in a more independent Scotland. The real game-changer was oil, which was first discovered off the Scottish coast in 1969. The Scottish National Party launched the “It’s Scotland’s Oil” campaign, rhetorically challenging the notion that Scotland was too poor to be independent. A proposal to transfer more powers to direct Scottish control, known as “devolution,” failed narrowly in 1979, but the idea persisted. In 1997, a Scottish parliament was established with jurisdiction over a range of mostly local and financial matters. Scotland has consistently voted to the left of England, widening the gap in perspective.
The debate over Scottish independence has hinged on economic concerns: from the practical problem of what currency an independent Scotland will use to larger questions of economic justice and inequality. A recent ad urging a “yes” vote for independence imagines the future of Scotland through the eyes of a baby born on the day of the referendum. Will she grow up in a more equal and optimistic society, or one marred by the greed of a distant elite? The sense that this vote is about the political and economic future of a state, not the apotheosis of a people, is reflected in the voting rules, too: Everyone aged sixteen or older living in Scotland may vote, regardless of national or ethnic identity, while Scottish-born or Scottish-identified people living elsewhere may not vote.
An independent Scotland has the potential to reimagine what a new nation’s priorities should be. It will inevitably be an example for other regions of Europe considering a similar move, such as Catalonia in Spain. Independent Scotland could set a precedent for the 21st century, whereby new states come into existence on the basis not only of historical traditional but also through the desire for a new social contract. This is a profound shift in focus, from the nation as the expression of personal identity to the nation as the structure for a better community.
What if Scotland votes no? I’m hopeful in that case, too. Britain has suffered a grinding recession characterized by sweeping cuts and a dubious austerity policy. In the wake of a no vote, Britain will have the opportunity to revise and reform how it works as a composite state, not only in Scotland but also in Wales and Northern Ireland and perhaps in northern England, too. The debate over independence has invigorated public discourse about core constitutional and economic issues. In the United States, we should pay attention to how the United Kingdom moves forward: It will be a lesson in how a federal state can grapple with large regional inequalities and different visions of economic and social justice.
The Scottish Enlightenment of Adam Smith and David Hume gave us a framework for understanding the modern world. After a century that saw nationalism linked more with pain than triumph, I am hopeful that Scotland is once more helping us dream it all up again.

Massachusetts has earned its reputation as one of the country’s most liberal states. It got rid of capital punishment in 1984, legalized same-sex marriage in 2003, and enacted a health reform law in 2006 that served as a model for President Obama’s reforms. But electing women to executive positions in the Commonwealth has always been difficult. Massachusetts has never elected a female governor.
Last Tuesday, Massachusetts voters made great strides toward shattering proverbial glass ceilings. We only wish that more Massachusetts voters had taken part in these historic primaries: Turnout is estimated at a meager 17 percent. This was a banner day for diversity, but voter turnout must improve.
As the Portland Press Herald noted Saturday, Massachusetts primary voters—particularly Democrats—put female candidates in a position to capture four of the Commonwealth’s six constitutional offices, including the governorship. The Democratic primary also saw strides in LGBT representation: the Democratic nominees Maura Healey and Steve Kerrigan would be the nation’s first openly gay attorney general and lieutenant governor, respectively. These demographic trends are heartening, and signal that Massachusetts political life may be moving away from the “old boys network” that has too often characterized it.
Yet low voter turnout suggests a serious problem with civic engagement. We aren’t convinced that the partisan primary system itself is to blame: States that have instituted non-partisan, “jungle,” primaries have seen no significant increase in turnout. California switched to such a system in 2012 and witnessed a 90-year low for primary turnout. Still, with solidly Democratic precincts quiet last week during a competitive primary, Massachusetts politicians need to do far more to attract the attention of their constituents, and voters themselves must engage more with the political process.
One possible source of voter disengagement is the lackluster campaign run by Attorney General Martha Coakley, the Democratic nominee for governor who bested Treasurer Steve Grossman and Dr. Don Berwick in the primary. As the Boston Globe noted in their endorsement of Mr. Grossman, Coakley’s campaign has rested on the laurels of her long tenure as Attorney General, and evinced little in the way of detailed policies.
Coakley’s opponent, Republican nominee and former healthcare executive Charlie Baker, has also failed to run a transformative campaign. The Globe again correctly diagnosed Mr. Baker’s shortcomings: While he presents a clear plan for reforming a state government mired in recent scandals, he has few other overarching themes.
In short, voters have every reason to believe that neither party’s major candidate is concerned enough with enacting bold, detailed policies. Low turnout across the state is a sign that too many of citizens still feel alienated from Massachusetts public life, or are simply too uninterested to become involved in even the most basic manner. Ms. Coakley’s and Mr. Baker’s uninspiring efforts have not helped matters.
Massachusetts primary voters should be proud of their tickets’ diversity, but not quite as proud of the campaigns their gubernatorial candidates have run to this point. In the general election, we hope that both campaigns do a far better job refining their platforms and reaching out to a voting public that deserves more from its politicians.

On September 15, 2001, the Sikh-American community was terrorized after learning about the murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi. Sodhi was shot and killed outside of his Mesa, Arizona, gas station. The assailant wanted to “kill a towel-head” in retaliation for the attacks on 9/11.
Sodhi, like many practicing Sikhs, kept unshorn hair, beard and a turban. Because there are so few Sikhs living in America, the Sikh turban and beard was often mistaken with images of Osama bin Laden, leaving many to be victim of hate crimes since the fall of the Twin Towers in 2001.
On August 5, 2012, as I was sitting at the local Sikh Temple, I received an alert regarding an attack at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The assailant went on a deadly rampage at the temple, fatally shooting six worshipers and wounding six others before turning the gun on himself. This was one of the worst attacks at a place of worship in America since the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama.
Such attacks continue to happen. This past July, a driver in Queens, New York, yelled racial slurs at Sandeep Singh, a married father of two, and ran over him in his pickup truck. Singh is now in critical condition at the local hospital. Last month, ten teenagers in Roosevelt Island, New York, attacked a doctor named Jaspreet Singh Batra. He was punched in the face and back of his neck. The assailants called him “Osama bin Laden” and told him to “go back to his country.”
President Lincoln once said that the “legitimate object of government is to do for the people what needs to be done, but which they cannot, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, for themselves.” Last year, the FBI decided to finally track hate crimes committed against Sikhs in particular, ensuring more accurate reporting and accountability. But more needs to be done.
A recent study presented by the Sikh Coalition in a briefing to the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus documented that Sikh children had been punched and kicked and had their turbans ripped off by fellow students. Slurs such as “terrorists,” “go back to your country” and “bin Laden” were yelled during the assaults.
We need a comprehensive approach to prevent hate crimes against the Sikh community. Local and state governments should include references to the Sikh faith in our curriculum, so our young citizens can be made aware of Sikhs. The U.S. government also needs to address the issue of racial profiling at the airports.
Each time, Sikhs are asked to step aside for “random screenings,” our fellow citizens implicitly assume that Sikhs pose a threat to our society, and that it is acceptable to single us out for unwarranted scrutiny. Finally, the U.S. government needs to end its presumptive ban on Sikhs from serving in our country’s military because of uniform regulations conflicting with the Sikh commandment to keep beards and unshorn hair. By not being able to freely serve our nation, we are unable to demonstrate our commitment to our nation, defend our freedoms on the frontlines, and win the hearts and minds of our fellow Americans.
While these actions won’t automatically end biases and acts of violence against Sikhs, they will solidify our nation’s commitment to ensuring Sikhs can fearlessly practice our faith, and that the government is doing for our people “what needs to be done.” In the end, we can only remember the victims of hate crimes and create a stronger union, if we strive to learn more about our neighbors, spread love, and eliminate any prejudices against others.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has further expanded its graduate program in Computational Science and Engineering, which now includes both a master of science degree and a master of engineering degree.
The one-year master of science degree was introduced in fall 2013, while the two-year, research-focused master of engineering degree began just this fall. Both degree programs are housed under the Institute for Applied Computational Science.
The CSE graduate program, which was first introduced in 2011 as a secondary field for doctoral students, was developed under the supervision of SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray with the help of an external advisory committee.
According to Daniel S. Weinstock, assistant director of graduate studies in computational science and engineering, 29 students are enrolled in the CSE programs this year—nine more than the first cohort who graduated last May.
Weinstock said that the introduction of the degrees came as a response to the “real need” for computational skills in industry. Computer science and applied mathematics courses make up the core curriculum of the two new degree programs.
“The master of science students that graduated last year were very successful in finding jobs,” he said, adding that CSE teaches degree candidates to apply methods from computer science to a wide variety of disciplines.
“I think this whole effort and enterprise is aimed at helping students understand how useful computation can be in today’s scientific environment but even in a broader sense how important computation is for doing all sorts of interesting things in the real world,” said physics professor Efthimios Kaxiras, founding director of the Institute for Applied Computational Science.
Kaxiras also said that SEAS is now considering offering a secondary field in CSE to undergraduate students as well.
“There is a lot of interest among undergraduates,” he said, adding that several of them have enrolled in CSE courses and others have jointly completed a bachelor degree and a master degree in CSE.
“Some people refer to [computation] as the third leg of science, the other two being theory and experiments,” he said, adding that the discipline is essential to a number of scientific fields.
According to Catherine A. Chute, executive director of the Institute for Applied and Computational Science, the CSE program is one of the ways in which Harvard is promoting twenty-first-century skills and knowledge.
“It’s a very interesting and exciting part of what Harvard is trying to do both out in the world and for its students,” she said.

UPDATED: Septmeber 16, 2o14, at 11:30 a.m.
Undergraduates taking Anthropology 1130: “The Archaeology of Harvard Yard” will soon begin excavating in Harvard Yard for a fifth year as part of the Harvard Yard Archaeology Project.
The anthropology course, which is composed of 22 undergraduates, meets weekly to excavate the area adjacent to Matthews Hall, one of Harvard Yard’s freshman dormitories. Students taking the year-long course will then analyze the items throughout the spring semester and develop a catalogue of all the items, which will be used by the Peabody Museum.
The excavations will take place in the Yard near the former locations of Harvard’s earliest buildings such as the 1638 Old College, the first university building in the United States, and the Harvard Indian College, the Yard’s first brick building, which was erected in 1655.
The project, which was initiated in 2005 following the 350th anniversary of the Indian College, focuses on exploring the archaeological remains of the Harvard Indian College. It is a collaboration between the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the Department of Anthropology, and the Harvard University Native American Program.
According to Patricia Capone, Curator and Director of Repatriation and Lecturer on Anthropology, previous archaeological digs in Harvard Yard have taken place in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011. She said that the project provides a cultural resource for students and praised the student-driven nature of the project.
“It seemed like a natural match to conduct a course by which students would both gain an opportunity to be trained in the methodology and the specifics of Harvard’s past,” Capone said, adding that the they hope to find structures that would provide a better idea of the extent of the building.
During the fall of 2009, students located a foundation trench they believe made up part of a wall of the Indian College. Seeking to explore the early days of the University, Capone said the project’s archaeological finds reveal how students lived at Indian College and colonial Harvard.
Teaching fellow for Anthropology 1130 Adam Stack said that he sees the project as an opportunity for students to engage on a deeper level with University’s history.
“[The course] really reaches beyond just the practical aspect of learning how to excavate,” Stack said. It puts us all and especially students in the class in a bigger relationship with the history we often walk past and don’t realize is there…. The students are researching the history and traditions they are a part of.”
Many of the items that have been discovered in past excavations are now a part of the Peabody Museum’ ongoing exhibition, Digging Veritas, which is co-curated by course instructors and students.

While the eight class marshals elected to represent the Class of 2015 hail from seven different Houses, more than half study Economics, and only two are female.
Nearly 1,000 members of the Class of 2015 submitted ballots for class marshal in the final round of voting, according to an email sent to seniors by the Alumni Association and Harvard College Fund on Monday. After weeks of campaigning on Facebook, through email, and in person, the eight were chosen from 16 candidates—whittled down from the initial 49 in the first round of voting.
All of the marshals expressed their surprise and delight upon receiving notification of their election.
Megan B. Prasad ’15, an inactive Crimson magazine editor, emphasized the large number of qualified candidates who ran for the eight positions this year.
“I felt like anybody that got it would be so great for the senior class and would make senior year really fun, so when I found out that I was picked I just felt really humbled,” she said.
Chisom M. Okpala ’15, named Second Class Marshal, said she was thrilled when she saw the results of the election.
“I couldn’t be more excited, working with such an incredible group of senior class marshals,” she said. “They’re all my friends, and we are going to have such a great working dynamic.”
Many of the newly elected marshals stressed the importance of planning inclusive programming for, what they described as, a very diverse senior class.
First Class Marshal Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who also serves as the vice president of the Undergraduate Council, called for an “inclusive community,” and Aleja A. Jimenez Jaramillo ’15 said he wants to make events “accessible for all students,” regardless of socioeconomic status, racial and cultural diversity, and physical disabilities.
Joshua B. Scott ’15 said he plans to reach out to his fellow seniors to determine what types of events they would prefer.
Bob Wu ’15 emphasized the significance of the traditional “Last Chance Dance” during Senior Week, particularly after the Class of 2015’s “First Chance Dance” was canceled due to an impending hurricane at the start of their freshman year.
Sudheer R. Poluru ’15 said he envisions such projects as a “thesis fairy” network and celebratory activities to support the seniors writing theses throughout the year.
In addition to planning events for seniors, the Senior Class Committee is tasked with inviting the Class Day speakers. Prasad said she believes humor befits Class Day, pointing to speeches in previous years by guests like Amy Poehler and Andy Samberg, and hopes to see someone with similar comedic skills take the stage in May. Jimenez Jaramillo noted that Beyoncé and Mindy Kaling would provide ideal Class Day entertainment and inspiration.
Though their on-campus activities run the gamut from House Committees to Crimson Key Society to the Expressions Dance Company, Prasad noted that the eight marshals are already a close-knit group.
Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15, an inactive Crimson photo editor, said that he has collaborated with many of his fellow marshals in various capacities, and that he is excited to work with them on planning senior events.
“I wasn’t surprised by any of the choices; they’re all incredible candidates,” he said. “They’re all very responsible individuals, and they’re all very well-loved in the community at Harvard.”

One hundred and three undergraduates have declared candidacies for 44 open spots on the Undergraduate Council, marking a nearly 20 percent increase from the number of candidates in last year’s elections.
The election data, provided to The Crimson by UC Elections Commissions chair Matthew C. Estes ’18, reveal the highest number of candidate declarations in at least three years, according to UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15.
While Estes and Mayopoulos both expressed excitement at what they believe will be competitive elections,  the spike in candidates came only after the UC extended the deadline for all undergraduates to submit their intention to run and platform from noon to midnight last Friday.
By the time the original deadline had expired, only one undergraduate had submitted a platform for the three open spots in Pforzheimer House, according to Estes. Six more candidates submitted platforms following the extension.
Estes said that he and the Elections Commission granted the extension because they share a desire with the UC to “have as fair and competitive a race as possible.” Mayopoulos added that the UC often grants such extensions.
As in previous years, the most competitive races will be held among freshmen candidates, with 14, 10, 13, and nine first year students running for three spots in Crimson, Elm, Ivy, and Oak Yards, respectively.
In Dunster House, however, only three students will compete for three spots, meaning that, notwithstanding campaign violations or write-in candidates, the three on the ballot will be elected. In all other Houses, the number of candidates running equals or exceeds the number of vacancies, indicating that all UC openings will be filled.
Mayopoulos pointed to the overall growth in candidate numbers as indicative of what he says was the UC’s increased visibility last year.
Referring to the joke campaign he ran on with Samuel B. Clark '15 in the UC presidential elections last year, Mayopoulos acknowledged that the “energy boost” he believed that campaign created might help to explain the increased competition in this year’s elections.
Addressing the broader trend of fewer upperclassman candidates than freshman candidates, Mayopoulos said he did not believe fewer upperclassmen run for UC positions because of less faith in the effectiveness of the body, but rather due to busier schedules.
“I think it’s very possible that upperclassmen are more jaded with the UC and don't see the UC as effective, but I don't believe that that explains why there are more freshman candidates as opposed to upperclassmen candidates,” he said.
Voting for the UC will open at noon on Wednesday and run until noon on Friday.

The Cambridge City Council voted Monday to continue funding affordable housing units with money set aside for community preservation. The policy order, which was proposed by City Manager Richard C. Rossi, stipulates that 80 percent of community preservation funds be spent on housing, 10 percent on open spaces, and 10 percent on historic preservation.
The plan, which has been abbreviated as the 80-10-10 plan, draws from money provided by the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) and local and state resources. The issue of affordable housing has been one of constant interest for the councilors, and nearly all of them expressed support for the plan, including Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher.
“I support the 80-10-10,” Maher said during the meeting. “Affordable housing should be in every neighborhood of the city.”
All in all, the plan's total expenditures exceed $12.5 million for fiscal year 2015, with $1.25 million spent on historical preservation and open spaces and $10 million allocated to the Affordable Housing Trust. Of the $12.5 million, $7.8 million will come from local funds, $1.7 million will come from the state, and the CPA fund will contribute $3.01 million.
The Trust was established in 1989 and is comprised of a nine-member board that is in charge of policy advice and loan distribution.
Councillor Marc C. McGovern noted that although over $130 million had been spent on affordable housing in Cambridge since 2002, there was a need for even more to combat the current “housing crisis.” He cited a study conducted in the local area which identified the minimum family income required to live “service-free” in Cambridge as $89,000.
Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan expressed his support for the concrete steps taken by the council, noting that Cambridge’s Affordable Housing Trust has helped countless families.
“We have long been talking about affordable housing in the abstract. It’s time to commit to affordable housing,” he said.
Still, Benzan expressed reservations about the fact that this proposal did not necessarily call for the development of new housing units. He noted the density of affordable housing developments in certain areas of town and lack thereof in others, adding that he hoped for more integration of affordable housing moving forward.
The plan was also favored by Cambridge residents, young and old, who appeared during the public comment portion of the meeting. Cambridge resident Sonia Anduya echoed the idea that increasing affordable housing creates a more diverse and inclusive Cambridge community.
“For us, the community preservation act is exactly that; about preserving diverse communities,” Anduya said.
The open spaces to which the funds will be allocated include the Cambridgeport School Playground and the Sennott Park Basketball courts. The historic spaces that will receive funding include the YWCA homeless shelter and O’Connell Branch of the Cambridge Public Library.

Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 defended the compensation of top managers of the Harvard Management Company in a letter sent late last week to a group of alumni that had previously criticized the University's investment arm.
Repeating the University’s standard defense, Rogers argued that the salaries are justified by HMC’s performance-based compensation model and its practice of managing many of its investments in house.
“HMC’s compensation system is designed to align the interests of investment staff with those of the University,” she wrote in the letter, dated Sept. 12.
Rogers was responding to a group of nine Harvard graduates, most of whom are from of the Class of 1969, who sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust dated Aug. 20, detailing their concern with the compensation levels of HMC employees. They wrote that they believe these salaries have, in the past few years, become increasingly less justifiable, as the endowment “struggles to recover” from the financial crisis.
HMC currently employs a performance-based compensation system. Rogers wrote in the letter that “approximately 90% of the bonus compensation paid to individual portfolio managers is based on investment performance over and above market benchmarks.”
In 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, outgoing HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo earned $4,801,347. Andrew G. Wiltshire, head of alternative assets for HMC and the company’s top earner, received $7,896,277 in compensation.
At the same time, HMC’s returns have fallen below those of the University’s peer institutions. In fiscal year 2013, for example, Harvard’s endowment was outperformed by every other Ivy League institution and Stanford.
In her response letter, Rogers pointed to HMC’s hybrid model of investing, in which HMC manages about 42 percent of total assets through internal managers and outsources the remaining 58 percent to external managers. She wrote that this model has saved the University more than $1.5 billion in the past decade in money that would have been paid to external managers.
Rogers also emphasized the importance of competitive salaries in attracting and maintaining talented managers.
David Kaiser ’69, an author of the alumni letter, said on Monday that he was not satisfied with Rogers’s response. He said that he does not believe that HMC salaries at their current levels are necessary to attract good portfolio managers, given the nature of the institution their investments support.
“I don’t think anyone whose main goal is to maximize their wealth should work for a university because I don’t think that’s what universities are supposed to be about,” Kaiser said.
Kaiser’s comments were consistent with the final two paragraphs of the alumni letter, which sought to center the conversation about compensation around values. The authors placed the HMC compensation debate in the context of Thomas Piketty’s recent book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” and questioned more broadly the values that HMC, as an institution that supports Harvard, should have.
“Has the time not come to ask ourselves whether we need our universities to promote distinctive values both in theory and practice, rather than simply lining up with institutions whose only professed purpose is to accumulate more wealth, promoting the profit motive and free markets,” the authors ask in the letter. “What values does Harvard stand for today, and are they truly reflected by the compensation scheme for Harvard Management?”
This is not the first time that the group of 1969 alumni has been critical of HMC’s compensation structure. The group wrote similar letters in 2009 and 2011 that also focused on changes in salaries since the recession.
While the recent letters have been met with what Kaiser calls very similar response letters from the University, the group played a role in the surge of criticism that ultimately resulted in a change in compensation policy in 2004.
In advance of their 35th reunion in 2004, in letters to then-President Lawrence H. Summers, they criticized what they alleged to be the inordinate salaries of HMC’s top-earners—two bond managers, Maurice Samuels and David R. Mittelman, earned $35.1 million and $34.1 million, respectively, in 2003.
Less than six months after the first letter, HMC President Jack R. Meyer announced that the maximum compensation for fund managers had been lowered, a change that the authors of the letter said was still not enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 16, 2014, at 7:00 p.m.
Two founding members of the Russian punk rock protest group Pussy Riot spoke out strongly against Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday night at a forum at the Institute of Politics, raising awareness of what they consider to be oppression propagated by Putin in their country.
Masha Alekhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova, who have become the public face of the group, told a packed John F. Kennedy Jr. forum about their experience of political imprisonment, reflected on Russia’s recent incursions in Ukraine, and advocated for the right to free speech.
“We think no one should be banned from something because of nonviolent expression of their opinions,” Tolokonnikova said.
Tolokonnikova and Alekhina attracted international attention when they were arrested on charges of hooliganism in August 2012 after attempting to perform the protest song “Mother of God, Drive Putin Away” at Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Their arrest and sentence—other members of the group avoided jail time—were met with significant criticism in the West. The two were granted amnesty and released in Dec. 2013.
Later in the evening, the activists appeared outside the Cambridge Police Department, where, according to their Twitter account, they had gone to investigate the arrest of a Harvard alumnus who had violated a ban on entering University property to attend the forum. The man, who had been banned from Harvard property after a previous protest, was released shortly thereafter.
Since their release the two artists have travelled internationally to advocate several causes, including feminism, rights for the LGBTQ community in Russia, and political freedom. Monday’s event, dubbed “A Conversation with the Feminist Protest Art Collective Pussy Riot,” was relatively rare for the IOP, which usually hosts politicians, political operatives, and journalists rather than artists like the members of Pussy Riot.
When asked about the pair’s major objections to Putin, Tolokonnikova noted that the president’s actions have resulted in a severe "brain drain” in Russia.
"The problem with Putin is that he brings the level of political discussion to the Stone Age,” Tolokonnikov said. “People are leaving because his international actions are dictated by paranoia."
While in prison, the two women participated in hunger strikes to protest the harsh conditions they faced. Upon their release, they founded a prisoners’ rights NGO called Zona Prava (Zone of Rights).
"You should just see prisoners and their problems as human problems, problems that all of us have," Alekhina said.
The activists added that they encountered support, and even autograph-seekers, among the prison staff during their sentence.
Despite their critiques of the state, they asserted that they do not intend to leave Russia.
"No. It's our language, our culture, not the culture of Putin,” Tolokonnikova said, suggesting that Russia remains the state of its people.
The lotteried event was moderated by former Shorenstein fellow and CNN Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty, while Tolokonnikova’s husband interpreted for the artists.
When a member of the audience attempted to ask a question after identifying himself as a reporter with The Huffington Post, Dougherty interrupted him, explaining that journalists are not allowed to asked questions at John F. Kennedy Jr. Forums. Half-jokingly, the reporter asked: “Is this Russia?”
The forum was also itself a venue for an act of protest, as Roman J. Torgovitsky, a Russia-born alumnus of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Health, violated a ban on entering Harvard property.
Torgovitsky was arrested for disorderly conduct in Sanders Theatre last May when he stepped onto the stage to confront violinist Vladimir T. Spivakov, a supporter of Putin’s policies in Ukraine.
On Monday, his presence and that of allied protesters outside the venue was intended to draw attention to the alleged injustice of the ban. Torgovitsky and supporters argued that the Harvard University Police Department misrepresented what occurred during the Sanders incident and that University administrators have subsequently ignored the issue.
After he stood to speak during the forum, HUPD quickly arrested Torgovitsky for trespassing. He was briefly held at Cambridge Police headquarters. Tolokonnikova and Alekhina arrived at CPD headquarters before Torgovitsky was released and tweeted several messages about his cause.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement on Monday that the University has alerted the Distaric Attorney's Office that it "does not plan to pursue the further prosecution of criminal charges."
"Our only interest is preventing the disruption of events at Harvard," Neal wrote.
Still, despite the presence of the protesters, the event went on undisrupted.
Many audience members responded positively to Tolokonnikova and Alekhina. Parth C. Thakker ’18, who was in attendance, said the event was “engaging.”
“You don’t usually have two members of a punk rock band on this stage which usually hosts dignitaries…. To have these two young people who do cool things was an offbeat experience itself,” Thakker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard women’s volleyball team (4-2) tied at 23 points apiece in the fourth set against last year’s SEC champion Georgia (5-3), the team needed someone to step up.
Sophomore setter Corie Bain did just that. The Manhattan, California native assisted on two straight points, giving the Crimson a 3-1 victory. The moment was indicative of the team’s growing trust in Bain, whom teammates say is playing well beyond her years.
“She is a leader both on and off the court,” sophomore outside hitter Grace Weghorst said.
And as the Crimson is quickly learning, trusting Bain pays off. Against the Bulldogs, Bain led the team with 14 kills as Harvard fought its way to its first victory of the Benson Hospitality Invitational.
“We know what kind of team we are,” Bain said. “We are a very good finishing team.”
Despite Bain’s flashes of brilliance, victory was not certain for most of the contest. Georgia started strong, taking a close first set and reaching set point late in the second set with a 20-18 advantage.
That’s when Bain took over. She assisted the next two points, 25-23, which yielded two kills by fellow second-year player Grace Weghorst and junior Caroline Holte. Two subsequent assists on the final two points sealed the set for Harvard.
Weghorst said that part of Bain’s value to the team is her ability to perform in these tense moments—not just to record the timely kill, but also to have the level-headedness to make the right assist at the right time.
“[Corie is] super calm even in situations that are pretty stressful,” Weghorst said.
Besides her calm in the clutch, teammates say, Bain has plenty of talent. As a freshman, she set the school record with 50 service aces.
But the sophomore’s skill set extends beyond that. The second-year player recorded six triple-doubles in her first campaign, which ranked second among all NCAA freshmen. The Ivy League recognized her standout season at the end of the year, unanimously selecting Bain as both Ivy League Rookie of the Year and a first team All-Ivy pick.
Bain’s diverse abilities were on display throughout the game against the Bulldogs. When Georgia appeared ready to run away with the game in the first set, four kills in five points kept the Crimson within striking distance.
Again in the fourth and final set, a Crimson run of 11 of 16 points to start the set, which included four kills by Bain, led to a Harvard lead that proved insurmountable. Although the Bulldogs pulled within two points, winning seven of nine points in the final stages of the set, the Crimson pulled away late.
“I was really proud of how we were able to deal with a high-ranked team,” Bain said.
Standing out in clutch situations is nothing new for Bain, who starred for four years at Mira Costa High School. In three of those four years, her team won the league championship, and she was named league MVP twice.
This season, Bain looks poised to take on a leadership role with Harvard, which has only three seniors on a team of 16. She already leads the team in kills and assists, with 55 and 153, respectively. Her 45 digs on the year are good for second on the team.
It was no surprise, then, that the volleyball found its way to Bain during the final two points of the match. Twice she set the ball for a Crimson teammate, and twice the teammate smashed the ball for a kill. It was Corie Bain at her finest—calmly and quietly leading Harvard to a team success.
It will be crucial for the team’s fortunes if Bain can continue her strong play as the team begins to wrap up nonconference play and heads towards Ivy League competition.
After a second place finish in the Ancient Eight last year, the team’s first finish in the top half of the league since the 2009 season, Bain and her teammates have their eyes on usurping last year’s winner and archrival Yale and taking home the conference championship.
“I am very confident in our team [this year],” Bain said. “We have a lot of talent and a very good bench…I’m excited [for the beginning of conference play].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second year under coach Pieter Lehrer, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-3-0) has endured a second rough opening to the season. A year ago, the Crimson was outscored 8-2 as it dropped its first three contests to Iona, Davidson, and Providence. In 2014, the quality of the opposition—two of Harvard’s first three opponents, St. John’s and Georgetown, are likely tournament teams—and scoring margin (2-6) have improved, but the record remains the same.
The early struggles have largely come on the offensive side of the ball. Heading into Tuesday’s home opener against Boston College (3-1-1), the Crimson has struggled to score—just two goals in three games—despite generating 21 shots on goal. That translates to a meager 10 percent conversion percentage, less than half of what Harvard achieved in Lehrer’s first season.
“Creating lots of chances and making sure we hit the back of the net are the important things,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “We are almost there.”
Boston College junior goalkeeper Alex Kapp, who has given up only three goals all season, will test the offense throughout the game. After giving up one goal in a double-overtime tie against Iona, he posted three straight shutouts before giving up two goals to Clemson in a 2-0 loss Friday night. Against a Crimson squad that has not scored more than one goal in any game, Kapp will look to get back on track.
However, the lack of goals belies what has been an across-the-board general improvement in the Crimson offense. Harvard has averaged 14.0 shots through the first three games, a full two better than last year. Albeit in a small sample size, corner kicks and shots on goal per game are up 24 percent and 32 percent, respectively.
“All the parts are there and we see it day in and day out and it hasn’t gotten to the field yet but we are not far off,” Lehrer said.
Lehrer says that this team has the same potential to flip a switch as the 2013 squad. Having won only one of its first nine games, the Crimson turned its season around with a 2-1 midseason win over defending league champion Cornell. The victory jumpstarted a stretch of five consecutive Ivy League wins as the team surged from last place to first.
“This is a team that can make a very deep run in the playoffs,” Lehrer said. “I know [that] where we are at that doesn’t look like the obvious answer.”
The Harvard defense—whose performance Ashby called “unacceptable” on Sunday—will be forced to defend a multifaceted Eagles attack. Boston College has generated nearly 15 shots a game, twice what it has allowed, in racking up eight goals across its first five games.
Sophomore forwards Zelko Lewis and Isaac Normesinu anchor the Eagles’ attack up front. The two have combined for five goals and 32 shots early on. Putting those numbers in perspective, the Eagles’ opponents have combined for just three goals and 36 shots.
Co-captain Kyle Henderson noted that even though the team has given up few shots on goal—just 13 through three games—its lapses have been quickly exploited.
Henderson said that leading up to the game, the team will focus on quickly identifying and correcting the errors that have led to the scores.
“For whatever reason, we are giving up goals and we need to find out what that comes down to,” Henderson said. “You can defend well 95 percent of the game, but if there is five percent that doesn’t go well, that’s enough.”
Henderson said that there is no panacea for the Crimson’s problems, and the team will have to work hard to turn it around.
“There is no magic fix,” Henderson said. “It is just looking at the film and seeing what we do well to keep moving things forward.”

Happy Tuesday, Harvard! We hope that all your new classes are still as exciting as they were the first day of shopping week, or if they didn’t seem exciting even then, that they're picking up a little now. The slight chill in the air makes it seem like summer was ages ago, even though fall hasn’t officially even started yet. We’ve recently been amused by the attempted transition clothing choices made by our fellow classmates, from the girl wearing a full on parka with a mini-skirt, to the guy in a bro tank and Tims, and the person in the classic midday sweatshirt and sweatpants combo. The last isn’t something one sees often here, but that just makes it all the more special, right?
IN THE ATMOSPHERETomorrow’s high is a pleasant 72 degrees, with a low of 51. It’ll be cloudy in the morning before clearing up in the afternoon, which works perfectly when you don’t wake up until the afternoon anyway.

College students can barely take care of themselves, much less their pets. This hasn’t stopped a few brave souls though—read their horror stories, their delights, and that one time they brought their mouse to Lowell Lecture Hall in a Starbucks cup. 
Flyby: How did you name your pet?
Pet Owner: Over the summer, I knew I wanted to get a fish. I specifically remember writing in my notes in my phone what I wanted my fish’s name to be, but then when I got my fish I couldn’t remember it. So I was looking through my notes, looking and looking, and I just had a note that said Piñata and a bunch of numbers, and I was like ‘Oh my gosh, this is it.' It had to be Piñata. Also it really fit his personality. He loves to party. He’s a really social, fun fish. He gets so excited when everyone comes into his room. He’s a really fun guy.
Flyby: When did you first get your pet? (brought from home, bought at college, adopted, etc.?)
Pet Owner: I got him at the start of the year with my mom. She was a huge supporter of the fish, so we went to Petco together and there was a whole rack of fish. Piñata and I had an immediate connection: I just knew he was the fish for me. We got him a vase. He sits on my dresser.
Flyby: What type of fish is Piñata?
Pet Owner: He’s a Beta Fish. He’s red with blue speckles. He’s really pretty. And he knows it.
Flyby: How easy is it raising a pet? How do you find time to take care of him?
Pet Owner: It could not be easier. First of all, he’s super agreeable and I only have to feed him once a day. He’s also always happy. There’s a thing with Beta Fish where they make bubbles when they’re happy, and his tank is filled with bubbles. One day, there were no bubbles in the tank and he looked really under the weather and I was like ‘Oh my god, I’m killing this fish,’ but I realized I forgot to put in some of the drops into his tank and then he was back in action. So I saved him.
Flyby: Does your pet have any cool tricks? Weird tricks? Any tricks?
Pet Owner: He follows me around the room. Kind of. When I’m standing in front of the tank and then when I move over he’ll move with me. He’s very energetic. He’s moving around all the time. He’s also a partier. He loves to go out. I really contemplated taking him somewhere with me in his little travel case. I’m planning on taking him to one of our blocking/linking group dinners.
Flyby: Is it hard keeping your pet a secret?
Pet Owner: I don’t even try. I tell everyone about him and take all my friends to meet him. I tell people he’s a really wise fish, and so if anyone needs advice on anything, find Piñata. I talked to him a lot about which classes to take, he gave me the best advice out of anyone. Advisor, no. Piñata, yes. He’s a man of few words, but he still has a lot of insight into life.
Flyby: Who do you like more—your roommates or your pet?
Pet Owner: This is really hard. I feel like Piñata really adds a lot to our group dynamic. He just really fits in with my whole friend group. Actually, that’s a lie. One of my roommates loves Piñata; the other one is so-so about him. Some of my linkmates think Piñata is stupid, which really hurts me and him. He’s been sort of offended by some of them. Most people have been very receptive to Piñata and welcomed him to our friend group.

The truth about your classes is now coming out: Study cards have been signed and the glitz and glam used to hook students in is gone, revealing what the semester will actually be like. Here's what the course descriptions should say.
Expos 20
If you thought you would never have to take an English class at college, tough luck. Now you have the opportunity to choose from 30 with misleading names such as “Darwinian Dating.” While you are told to rank your Expos choices, it’s more or less arbitrary, and you’ll probably wind up with your fifth choice. But that’s okay, it’s not like you wanted to take any of these classes anyway. In Expos, you will learn how to write like a college student, which on paper means delving deeper into texts and getting a better grasp on the material, but for you will mean staying in the library until 3am, trying to BS your way through a first draft with an argument you don’t actually agree with.
LS1A
Welcome naïve pre-meds and potential science concentrators! This class is designed to weed out those of you who will never make the cut as a science concentrator. If you don’t totally hate everything about chemistry and biology by the time you finish this course, congratulations! You can make it as a scientist. If not, you should have just put your pride aside and taken LPSA. Psets are hard, but at least you get to collaborate with friends, and have a week to complete them. The punch line is that the tests are just as hard, if not harder, and you only get 2 hours to do it, all by yourself.
Ec 10
We know that you’re going to take this class anyway, so we’re not going to waste our time putting an effort into getting you to like it. I mean, just look at the course description. You think you’re living the true Harvard experience by attending a class taught by one of the country’s best economists, but he only lectures six times the entire semester.
SLS 20
We know that most of you guys are humanities kids trying to fulfill that SLS gen ed, so we’ll try to put as little science as possible into this course. You’ll love it too, because you get to watch crazy videos of blind people making their way through an obstacle course and babies being their adorable dumb selves. You’ll learn about how the mind works, but never actually apply any of it to your life. For example, memory is better consolidated if you start studying weeks ahead of time, but you’ll still start only the day before the exam. Speaking of exams, this class is basically a huge psychological experiment seeing how far we can push you guys until your heads literally explode while taking a test. So will you a) take this class b) not take this class c) maybe take this class d) both a and c e) all of the above except d?
Gov 20
This class ensures that you can understand what the pundits on CNN and MSNBC are discussing. Hopefully after this class, the world won’t seem as confusing as before. However, you’re gonna have to do a ton of readings to get to that point. Sure, you’ll dread it, but you’ll still love Levitsky and you know it—have you seen that 4.20 Q score? Killin’ it.
CS 50
Computer science is taking over the job market these days, so for those of you who want a job after college, you should probably take this course. You and 800 other kids—good luck on finding a seat. Most people who take this class don’t even have any experience in CS, which means that this is going to be hard for them, oh well. The struggles serve to unite students, and then pull them into a cult known as CS 50. Join us. Don’t question us.
