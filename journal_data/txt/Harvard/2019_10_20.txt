The CW’s “Batwoman,” the latest installation in the “Arrowverse,” a fictional comic universe, delivered a shaky first performance, resting on the well-trodden stones of the many superheroes and villains that came before it.
The drama begins, in the grand tradition of superhero network dramas, with a quest and somewhat unfounded savior complex. Kate Kane — the future Batwoman, played by a vaguely Australian-sounding Ruby Rose — returns to Gotham City after spending several years abroad, training in the hopes of joining the Crows, a private security company founded by her father after Batman’s mysterious disappearance. She comes to save her ex-girlfriend, Sophie (Meagan Tandy) after her kidnapping by a new supervillain: Alice (Rachel Skarsten), a sinister parody on Lewis Caroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Alice has no real superpowers or distinction save for clear insanity — she lacks both the supernatural bite of Poison Ivy and psychological thrill of the Joker, the latter compounded perhaps by a lackluster performance on Skarsten’s part.
Alice’s character epitomizes the primary problem with “Batwoman”: its cloying unoriginality. Every piece of the plot, every character trait and flaw, has been repurposed and refitted from somewhere else. Kate grapples with the childhood tragedy of losing her mother and sister in an automobile accident, but her devastating backstory is merely a variation on Bruce Wayne’s theme. Her stepsister, Mary (Nicole Kang), appears at first glance to be superficial and self-obsessed, but later reveals a hidden “deep” side in an anticipated character reversal. At the end of the episode, Sophie introduces Kate to her husband, thus unveiling a tidy love triangle.
Archetypal characters and tropes have the inevitable effect of a predictable plot. Superhero series in particular, like hospital dramas, find themselves all too-often lapsing into a formulaic progression revolving around a villain, a victim, and a superhero setting out to do one thing but actually realizing or discovering something else, usually about themselves and their personal lives. What distinguishes one good drama from the next, however, are the depths of the characters and the different twists and turns along the way. Even the grand reveal at the end of the episode was not shocking so much as expected: Alice is Kate’s sister. This comes as little surprise. The deaths of Kate’s sister and mother are left intentionally ambiguous, and the motif of their matching ruby necklaces pops up at convenient, significant moments.
The larger problem, though, is that “Batwoman” attempts to hide its plot flaws behind the guise of representation. True, the cast is diverse, with a lesbian protagonist and lead love story. True, also, that Kate does not parade around the show in a parody of a sexualized femme fetale; instead of 24/7 latex bodysuits, she wears black leather jackets and jeans. She has character traits and talents beyond a pair of long legs and the ability to aim and fire.
Unfortunately, the storylines associated with this representation are still not all that original. Kate and Sophie have a secret romance at a military training school, and when discovered and given the choice of either denouncing their sexuality or being expelled, Kate leaves and Sophie stays. It’s a stereotypical depiction of lesbian romance a tried-and-true recipe. When these tropes are mixed with supposedly-representative characters and conflicts, they have the ill-fated effect of coming off as focus-group pandering.
All this is not to say that “Batwoman” has been rendered completely irredeemable by its premiere. The show has an undeniably political undertone that has the potential to become compelling food for thought rather than fodder for repetition. Kate and Sophie’s threadbare relationship drama is saved by their classist differences. Sophie does not stay at the military academy out of shame, but rather because she does not have the financial security to leave. Mary, who studies medicine, opens up a free clinic to give medicine to the less-fortunate, a somewhat pointed attack at the healthcare system in the United States.
The family dynamics, too, have the potential to make interesting drama. Kate’s father (Dougray Scott) clearly has unresolved feelings for his late wife and daughter. This is particularly apparent when he tells Kate, “You’re all I have left.” Nonetheless, he has an image-conscious, viciously-ambitious wife and stepdaughter who prevent him from reaching any sort of resolution about his tragic past.
Batwoman’s character ultimately has the most potential. She stands as of now at a fork in the road: could either go the route of the stereotypical superhero, resolving her tragic backstory piecemeal and struggling to reconcile her abilities with her desires, or she could fall off the path altogether and become someone new to the screen. The show, after all, is called Batwoman. At the end of the day, she determines its success or its failure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you looked up at the skies recently? While we hop between puddles and huddle against a fresh wind in the Yard, fall blossoms. With the sweeping away of summer, the world begins to look like a setting fire. Pinkish hues at sunset cool the atmosphere. Then the colors touch the leaves. This season of splendor and solemnity makes poets of us all during the moments we look and listen. Here is a collection of three short poems by American poets from the past century to get you in the autumnal mood.
Fall Song
Joy Harjo
A call to remember what’s most important (and forget midterms...)
The ephemerality of fall evokes the preciousness of the present moment in this poem by the new Poet Laureate of the U.S., Joy Harjo, the first Native American to hold the post. Taught sensorial observations of fall’s darkness and dampness spring into a meditation on the “divine”: Don’t we all need “a song that will keep sky open” in our minds? Yet the season’s imperfect, overcast skies resist the search for perfection in a single moment; rather, we should be in the moment, don’t “lose now,” of which the rest of time will make sense. The precise concluding lines return us to the empirical world as the narrator comes home from an autumnal walk. There in the hallway, two coats hang beside each other as precarious leaves. In this one terse metaphor, fall is love burnished by a consciousness of human life’s brevity.
Fall in Massachusetts
Isabella Gardner
To herald Halloween, a hellish poem that embraces the witches of history!

An actress hailing from Newton, Massachusetts, Isabella Gardner was also a notable writer and editor of poetry during the mid-20th century. The name Isabella Gardner may bring to mind the art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner whose eccentric wonderland of an art collection is housed in Boston, and there is in fact a familial connection: Isabella Gardner was the latter’s great-niece. In this particular poem, fall is invoked as a pathetic fallacy of the observer’s condemnation of witch trials. Gardner mocks charges of heresy by subversily associating both heaven and nature with flames and kindling of destruction. Most disturbingly is how the “starving field” through such witch trials implies a spiritual autumn resolved by sowing death. The autumnal notion of fall is thus intertwined with the Biblical notion of postlapsarian man. Gardner deploys theological concepts against persecution on religious grounds. The “Fall” of the poem’s title, when read as man’s descension into sin, characterizes the witch trials and not the witches. Hell yeah!
Four Poems
Lorine Niedecker
A light-humored meditation to ward off the cold
The mid-20th century American poet Lorine Niedecker remained largely removed from the city-based poetry scene and lived most of her life in Wisconsin where she was born. Her sweet and spare poetic language embraces flora and fauna. The seasons, meanwhile, are her spectacles, and in part three of this poem she humorously perceives the autumnal in us: “Fall / We must pull / the curtains — / we haven’t any leaves.” Niedecker reads us as newly-naked trees in another play on Biblical connotations of “fall.” To keep warm when icy gales blow, consider the branches up above shaking not because of the wind but out of embarrassment that someone’s looking at them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass. — The 2019 Harvard Crimson football team has not been one for hot starts. Every game, giving up a quick score has seemed like a rite of passage. The team, however, has capitalized directly following the sluggish starts. Even within the context of the season as a whole, an early stumbling has given way to a four-game winning streak.
“We still do this thing where we seem to give up a touchdown in the first series, and then we seem to play pretty much lights out for the rest of the game,” said senior defensive lineman Brogan McPartland. “It worked today, but we're going to try to cut that out.”
While the trend was continued in Worcester, the Crimson (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) wasted no time in taking control of the game after an initial stumble to race ahead to an early lead that it would never relinquish. Boosted by defensive takeaways and 24 consecutive points in the first 20 minutes of the contest, Harvard swiftly retook the driver’s seat and spoiled a well-attended Holy Cross (3-4, 1-0 Patriot League) homecoming game, 31-21.
“It's huge, the ability to get takeaways by our defense, because the opponent's not getting anything,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It created short fields, created scoring opportunities, and it flat out was the difference in the game. Neither team was able to mount long drives, so when you had an opportunity, you better cash it in, and we were fortunate to get that early in the game.”
On just the third play of the game, Holy Cross lined up to attempt a conversion on third and one. Quickly darting between defenders just behind his offensive line, senior running back Domenic Cozier hit daylight just after crossing over the line of scrimmage. For the next 66 yards, he would go untouched into the end zone for the first score of the game, just 76 seconds into the contest.
“We've had three of our five games this year [where] the opponent has scored on the first or third play in the game,” Murphy said. “We've come back to win two of those and our coaches have done a great job making adjustments.”
Harvard, hoping to match the Crusaders on its first possession, did little to swing the momentum back in its favor before even running a play. A delay of game set the Crimson offense back five yards prior to ever snapping the football.
Setup by a Holy Cross pass interference, Harvard capped off a nine play, 75 yard drive as junior quarterback Jake Smith found senior receiver Jack Cook streaking down the sideline. The passer fit the ball into an over-the-shoulder window for an 18 yard touchdown to tie the game at seven points apiece.
Despite an unsportsmanlike penalty on Smith following the touchdown setting the kickoff back to the Crimson’s own 20, a fumble recovery on the kickoff sent Harvard’s offense right back onto the field. Poking the ball away was sophomore defensive back James Herring, whose special teams playmaking ability was highlighted last week by two blocked punts.
“Our defense came up huge on forcing some takeaways in the first half, and that really was the biggest focal point of the game,” Murphy said. “To have short fields and be able to punch those in and jump on these guys was really tell of the game.”
Harvard was propelled by impressive playmaking ability from its defense. The Crimson forced four fumbles, recovered three, got to the quarterback for five sacks, and added on an interception, all without captain defensive back Wes Ogsbury.
“I thought our defense played very well today,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You know, we had some guys that were nicked up, we played a lot of different guys on the defensive line and we still managed to get pressure, and we still managed, to most of the time, be able to dominate the run or at least contain the run.”
This impressive defensive line performance was spearheaded by McPartland. The senior exploded for three sacks, gashing the Holy Cross offensive line. The veteran, playing in only his second game of the season, brought his season total to an impressive seven sacks.
“It feels good to be back,” McPartland said. “This my second game back, so I’m just excited to be back with the boys playing football again.”
 For the Crusaders, McPartland’s performance was no surprise.
“You know there were times we had two guys on [McPartland] and he’s still able to get to the quarterback,” Holy Cross coach Bob Chesney said.” He's a very good football player, and I think that's something that we had anticipated and had an idea of, and he just had his way with us at times.”
Chesney was not the only person in attendance to recognize McPartland’s impressive play. The senior was honored as the Johnny Turco Memorial Trophy winner following the contest.
“I didn't even know they did a trophy, it's cool that they give a trophy to the other team and I'm just happy to receive it,” McPartland said. “It's gonna get dedicated to the D-line as a whole. That’s not just me, that’s a whole group effort.”
The defensive line certainly earned its stripes against the Crusaders’ offensive front. After the early 66 yard burst, the defense allowed only 16 rushing yards to compliment its five sacks.
“We've had to make that our identity this year, we just try to nut the run and then we know they're going to have to drop back and that's where we really strive, we’ve got a lot of guys can get after the quarterback,” McPartland said. “We thought they were probably the best O-line we’ve faced so far, but that's our bread and butter so we love that, we love competing trying to get at the quarterback.”
 Following a four minute drive of only 16 yards, senior kicker Jake McIntyre put a 36 yard field goal right down the middle to swing the lead in Harvard’s favor.
Despite the slowing of the game’s tempo, Harvard kept the momentum in its favor behind the line of scrimmage. Following a sweep blown up four yards in the backfield by senior defensive back Cole Thompson, scrambling Crusader quarterback Connor Degenhardt was stripped on just the second play of the drive, setting up yet another short field for Harvard.
This time around, the Crimson wasted no clock in capitalizing on the turnover. A 22 yard pass from Smith found junior tight end Ryan Reagan in the back of the end zone, putting Harvard up 17-7. Following its model of consistency, another unsportsmanlike conduct followed the score, setting the kickoff back 15 yards once again. Senior receiver Cody Chrest was the culprit this time around.
Despite the improved field position, a quick three-and-out ended in a quick Holy Cross punt. By the conclusion of the first quarter, the Crusaders had only controlled possession for three and a half of the first fifteen minutes of play.
Unfortunately for Holy Cross, the second quarter started much like the first. First, the Crimson floundered just as they did to start the game. Two negative plays set Harvard up for a third and 20, yet junior punter Sean McKeogh pinned the Crusaders on their own five yard line.
Again, however, the tide quickly turned back to Harvard. The Crusaders’ third lost fumble in their own territory came at its own three yard line, setting up the shortest field yet for Harvard. Yet another score on the first play of the drive came from junior running back Devin Darrington, who darted, juked, and spun around three missed tacklers in the backfield before waltzing into the endzone to add to the Crimson’s now 17 unanswered and give Harvard a two possession lead.
Holy Cross did little to quell the swinging the Crimson tide. A holding on the ensuing kickoff, despite a fair catch touchback, was followed by a false start to start the drive on the Crusader’s own 10 yard line. A negative rush, a dropped pass, and another fumble ended the drive before it even got the chance to get off the ground. Luckily for Holy Cross, its fourth fumble squirted out of bounds and allowed the team to mercifully punt.
Possibly uncompelled by the Crusader’s minimal efforts to shift the momentum, a ferocious block that sealed Smith’s 30 yard scramble to start Harvard’s next drive was called back for a questionable blind-side block penalty. The Crimson would punt to Holy Cross, setting up another seesaw that would result in a total of seven consecutive punts, a trend broken up only by halftime.
This back-and-forth continued throughout the entire contest, with a combined third down conversion rate below 25 percent and a total of 19 punts between the two teams.
The break offered more excitement than the the last 11 minutes of the first half thanks to the Crusaders’ fire-wielding baton twirler.
This slowing of offensive playmaking heading into the break was a new development for Harvard, yet came as no change for Holy Cross. The Crusaders finished the half with only 66 total yards, the same amount gained on their rushing touchdown on the third play of the game. This play also served as the Crusaders’ only first down of the first half.
Despite a three-and-out from Harvard, a booming 76 yard bomb from sophomore punter Jon Sot pinned Holy Cross on its own 10 yard line flipped the field and gave the Crimson better field position following the Crusaders’ respective punt.
“A 76 yard punt,” Chesney said. “Damn. It got over our kid’s head. Our kid was at 55, not thinking [Sot] could kick 70 something in the air, and he did.”
Following a 10 yard loss due to the third errant Harvard shotgun snap to touch the ground, the Crimson pinned yet another punt inside the Crusaders’ 20 for the third time in the contest.
“I was a little disappointed in the special teams field position as well,” Chesney said. “But you know that little bit of wind, and the two different punters pose a little bit of a problem.”
For the second week in a row, the punt game proved immensely important for Harvard. Coming off of an impressive week against Cornell averaging 56.3 yards per punt, Sot’s 76 yard boot topped his previous career high by a single yard.
“You feel like you're in an alternate universe, the way that our punters are punting the ball,” Murphy said. “We knew they were good. Obviously Jon was the first team All-Ivy kid as a freshman, but the combination of both those guys in different situational punts has been a weapon beyond even what we expected.”
Jon’s counterpart McKeogh finished the game having downed five of his six punts inside the Holy Cross 20 yard line.
“We knew they were talented,” Murphy said. “All of a sudden they're really embracing their role as being able to impact the game.”
 Not one to break trends, Harvard started the third quarter with an interception across the middle of the field on its first play of the second half, gifting Holy Cross its first play run in Crimson territory on the day. On the second play of yet another Crusader drive devoid of a first down, a 17 yard scamper from Cozier made the score 24-14 just 33 seconds into the second half.
Outside of this early score, the back-and-forth punting was finally broken in a bizarre manner. A short punt taking a huge Harvard bounce was inexplicably jumped on by Crimson senior linebacker Joey Goodwin, despite the punt never having been touched. Instead of taking the advantageous field position, the mistake allowed Holy Cross to take over from Harvard territory. Luckily for the Crimson, sophomore Crusader kicker Derek Ng pulled a 49 yard field goal wide left.
Harvard wasted no time in capitalizing on the miss. For the third time this game, the Crimson would find the endzone on the first play of the drive, this time from 68 yards out on a deep catch and run from Chrest to give Harvard a 31-14 lead.
After Harvard’s next drive, a punt from McKeogh pinned Holy Cross on its own six yard line, the fourth time the Crimson and the third time McKeogh forced the Crusaders to start a drive inside its own 20. The ensuing punt setup helpful Harvard field position at midfield, a position that helped McKeogh pin Holy Cross inside its own red zone once again. Despite finally gaining another first down, consistent pressure on the quarterback forced the Crusaders to punt yet again.
Having been bottled up for an underwhelming average of 2.9 yards per carry in the first three quarterbacks, Darrington showed off his speed and elusiveness to start a Harvard drive with two consecutive carries for 43 yards to eclipse 90 rushing yards for the fourth straight game. He would finish with 28 carries for 125 yards and a touchdown.
 As a team, Harvard carried the ball a whopping 51 times for 161 yards. While only throwing the ball 19 times, Smith showed off playmaking abilities when necessary, finishing with three touchdowns.
Harvard was able to start in the red zone deep into the game thanks to another turnover deep in Holy Cross territory on a diving interception by junior linebacker Jack McGowan at the 16 yard line. On the first play of the drive, Smith threw a poor ball into traffic, but a sure Crusader interception was soiled by a second defender colliding into the defensive back and inadvertently breaking up his own team’s turnover. An incomplete Crimson pass on fourth down a few plays later saved Holy Cross from the costly mistake.
With just over three minutes to play, the Crusaders finally started to show more life in their offense. Back-to-back screen passes for 48 total yards setup a 30 yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Tenio Ayeni and cut the deficit to 10 points with just 1:42 left in the fourth.
The score proved much too little, too late, as an unsuccessful onside kick gave Harvard possession once again. Just before the clock expired, McKeogh booted the ball down to the Holy Cross six yard line for his fifth inside the 20 on the contest, sealing the 31-21 victory for the Crimson.
