After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is night in the arctic, and the ice has begun to crack. Augustine (George Clooney) desperately attempts to drive his snowmobile onto solid ground. As he revs up the engine, the ice below him gives and he goes under. For a moment he tries to go after the snowmobile. Tense music plays as he struggles to swim faster. Then suddenly, serenity; he stops fighting, and the music cuts out, and he watches the snowmobile slip underwater. This scene perfectly embodies the major themes of “The Midnight Sky.” When is it time to give up? And once it is too late to fix anything, what do you do next?
In “The Midnight Sky” (which George Clooney also produced and directed) the battle is over before the film even starts. Earth is no longer a habitable planet due to a sudden unspecified disaster. Humans are still around, but it is only a matter of time before everyone dies out. Augustine, a planetary scientist with a terminal illness, decides to stay behind at his arctic research facility, as everyone else quickly evacuates underground. Soon after, he discovers a little girl (Iris) has seemingly been left behind at the facility. Together, they embark on a mission to communicate with a group of astronauts who are still in space, warning them not to return to Earth in light of the catastrophic disaster. The movie splits its time between Augustine and Iris on earth and the astronauts in space, showing them as they grapple physically and psychologically with the imminent destruction of humanity.
“The Midnight Sky” is strongest in scenes where Clooney depends on striking visuals, rather than dialogue, to propel the story (such as the scene with the snowmobile). Under Clooney's direction, the bleak white arctic setting is rendered almost as other-worldly as the distant planet the astronauts visit. The images of Augustine and Iris making their way across this lifeless and seemingly endless landscape captures the desperation and even futility of their journey far better than any dialogue could. While both the arctic and space are shown to be harsh and deadly, Clooney portrays real beauty behind that harshness. Most strikingly, towards the end of the movie, the astronauts catch a glimpse of the earth engulfed in black clouds — polluted beyond saving. Even with the pollution, Clooney’s framing feels similar to that of “The Blue Marble” (the first-ever photograph of the planet from space). Earth may be distant and strange as it floats in a sea of vast nothingness, but it is still recognizably home. In using this reference, the earth Clooney presents remains awe-inducing, despite being in the midst of destruction. Through these images, Clooney is able to communicate one of the main arguments of the film: that even if everything is past saving, there is still something inherently beautiful and worthy about this planet and about humanity — in a film largely devoid of hope, it's a surprisingly moving takeaway.
Unfortunately, Clooney’s masterful visual storytelling is not enough to fill two hours of cinema, and the actual viewing experience of watching “The Midnight Sky” is a primarily dull one. This is partially due to the fact that Augustine is not a particularly compelling character. In the tradition of similar space movies like “Ad Astra,” Augustine is haunted by regret from having prioritized the search for a habitable planet over his relationships with loved ones. Clooney does not quite manage to capture this angst in his performance, and often comes off as more grumpy than haunted. No more interesting is Iris (Caoilinn Springall), his child companion who is functionally mute, occasionally cute, but mostly a bit off-putting. Iris and Augustine’s storyline is strongest in the more tense moments of the film when their relationship is used to explore what a parent’s responsibilities are if death is imminent. However, during the long portions of “The Midnight Sky” where the two are just spending time together, traversing Antarctica, the movie suffers pacing problems and lags horribly.
While the astronauts are much more interesting than Augustine and Iris, they don’t get significant screen time until the second hour. As a result, they never feel completely fleshed out as living, breathing characters. Still, thanks to solid performances including two standouts from Felicity Jones and David Oyelowo, the astronauts are charming, fun to watch, and move the movie forward in a way that almost makes up for the lethargic first half. Generally, “The Midnight Sky” gets better as it goes on. In fact, the highlight of the movie is its ending, which features a twist that is both heartbreaking and paints the entire story in a new light. Yet "The Midnight Sky" takes so long to get to this admittedly stunning finale that audiences are likely to have lost interest when the moment comes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 12, after a day of classes at Harvard Law, I drove to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston to get my second dose of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine. After a blood draw and a Covid-19 test, I rolled up my sleeve and received the injection, which was quick and painless. I had a low-grade fever and flu-like symptoms for a few hours the next day, but by the evening I felt great and even went on a run around Cambridge (mask included).
I signed up to participate after reading about the vaccine trial in October, and I received the first dose just a few days later. I was inspired by the heroic efforts of the millions of essential workers in hospitals, grocery stores, restaurants, nursing homes, and schools who are courageously stationed on the front lines and risking their health to serve the collective good in a time of uncertainty and fear. Many of them were forced by economic exigencies and governmental failures to place themselves in harm’s way, but many acted voluntarily. Thinking of their sacrifice, I was eager to roll up my sleeve and contribute in whatever way I could — knowing there might be some risk.
This year has been one of misery, isolation, and death as the coronavirus has torn through our society and devastated our deteriorating civil and political infrastructure. Millions of workers have lost their jobs and filed for unemployment, facing misery and indignity as their families slip into poverty. Thousands have been evicted from their homes, forced into overcrowded shelters, hastily thrust into remote learning, social gatherings have been canceled, and many of us have gone months without seeing friends and family. Millions of individuals have been infected with the virus and, most tragically, hundreds of thousands have died from it, hooked up to ventilators, separated from their loved ones, and surrounded by medical workers in protective gear as they struggle to take their final breaths.
Unsurprisingly, the virus has struck with particular ferocity at the margins of our society: among the poor, minorities, the undocumented, and the elderly stashed away in nursing homes like old furniture. The most affected have been those who are surplus to the profit-seeking needs of corporate executives and the vote-seeking needs of politicians, and perhaps that is why the government response, particularly at the federal level, has been so incredibly impotent. While exhausted medical workers have made courageous sacrifices to protect the health of their communities, some in positions of power have been more concerned with preserving the “integrity” of the financial system and securing corporate profits than with preventing the spread of the virus, protecting the public, or providing the relief that workers, hospitals, small businesses, and communities so desperately need.
Overcoming such an unprecedented public health crisis requires cooperation, compassion, sacrifice, and solidarity, so it is hardly surprising that our social system, governed by individualism, competition, exploitation, and atomization has failed. This pandemic has only exacerbated the preexisting structural failures of our society and exposed the delusion of shaping economic and political systems around the principles of narcissism and greed.
But moments devastated by crisis are also moments pregnant with opportunity. The lockdown has given many of us a valuable chance to slow down and reflect — to question our priorities, reimagine our economic system, and wonder if our society should be, or could be, organized differently.
This moment of reflection arrives at a critical point in human history, at a time when humanity faces grave challenges. Pandemics, famines, plutocracy, fascism, nationalism, nuclear proliferation, ecological devastation, climate change — it is no exaggeration to say that the very existence of human civilization is threatened. All these seemingly unrelated crises are merely different aspects of the same underlying crisis: a society organized around greed and competition rather than compassion and cooperation. Our generation will be forced to resolve this conflict, whether we like it or not. We will either transition to a more democratic and sustainable society or we will witness the decay of human civilization.
It is a hopeful moment as vaccine distribution has begun, and in the next few months things will start to get better. This current crisis will fade, but we must not throw away the powerful moment of reflection that it provided and ignore the other very real, if less visible, crises that threaten humanity, like the hidden pandemics of poverty, violence, ignorance, inequality, and climate change. My hope is that, through the tragedy and misery of this pandemic, our generation has been collectively inspired to organize a more just, equitable, and sustainable society in order to overcome the calamities that threaten to destroy us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 100 Cambridge residents fled their homes last week, forced out by a fire originating on the third floor of a condominium in Harvard Square that spread throughout the building.
Cambridge Fire Department was notified of the fire the night of Jan. 12, the, which occurred at 14 Concord Ave., at 11:48 p.m., according to Cambridge Fire Chief Gerard E. Mahoney. Firefighters worked for approximately one hour to put out the flames and ensure no one was left inside.
Mahoney said the fire originated in an apartment on the third floor of the building and its cause was likely a defective refrigerator compressor.
He also said there were no fatalities. Two occupants were transported to the hospital and two cats died in the fire.
The building contains 44 units, 35 of which were occupied by permanent residents, Cambridge spokesperson Lee Gianetti wrote in an email.
First-responders were able to rescue everyone in the building through its interior stairway, Mahoney said. He added that the firefighters did “a phenomenal job.”
One resident, Michika Onoda, said he awoke the night of the fire to an alarm but did not immediately smell smoke. Police officers knocked on his door, prompting Onada, his wife, and their six-month-old baby to leave the apartment and evacuate outside.
At around 3 a.m., Onoda said he was able to briefly return to his apartment, escorted by a firefighter, to rescue his cat and retrieve his cellphone, wallet, and food for his baby.
Mahoney said that the fire “never would have gotten to the extent that it did” if the building had a sprinkler system installed. Due to what he called “a very unfortunate exemption” in Chapter 148 of Mass. General Laws — which contains the state’s fire prevention codes — the state did not require the condominium to install a sprinkler system.
Mahoney said he hopes the Commonwealth will use last week’s fire as an impetus to revise the law.
“I think this is a perfect opportunity for the fire service to seize the opportunity to make a push and to use this fire as a perfect example,” he said. “Fire sprinklers save lives, fire sprinklers save buildings.”
State Fire Marshal J. Peter Ostroskey said the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services encourages the installation of sprinkler systems in any residential setting.
“Certainly we’ll continue to work with stakeholders to try and improve the availability of sprinklers to protect the public,” he said. “We would encourage people to install sprinklers at the time of construction whether or not there’s a regulation in place.”
To house 25 displaced residents who “didn’t have other means and places to stay,” the Red Cross, with the assistance of the City of Cambridge, helped subsidize the cost of several nights’ stay at the Sheraton Commander Hotel, said Jeff Hall, a spokesperson for the organization’s Massachusetts chapter.
“We worked with the owner of the affected building to help pay for those hotel rooms, and we provided food and other basic needs,” Hall said. “We’ll follow along with the people probably for the next two to three weeks to make sure that they have a plan to get resettled somewhere.”
Gianetti wrote that the city is providing financial support to residents affected by the fire through the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund.
Onoda said he and his family stayed at the Sheraton until Sunday when they relocated to an Airbnb. He said he hopes he will be able to return to his apartment within a few weeks.
“The apartment manager said they will clean the entire building in this week,” he said. “The City of Cambridge will check the situation of the apartment, and if it’s okay, I will be permitted to [go] back to the apartment.”
Onoda said that though the fire did not spread to his top-floor apartment, his belongings smell like smoke and will need to be either thoroughly cleaned or completely replaced. He added that he does not have fire insurance.
Before residents can safely return to the building, Mahoney said the City must inspect the property to ensure it is safe and make sure all repairs were done according to code.

There’s a magical time at Harvard, when the temperature drops and the overpriced puffer coats and boots are finally brought out. This year, many of us may be enjoying this classic season from home, where things are probably a little different from the snow-covered (and tourist-covered) Yard we know and love. Don’t worry! With Flyby’s help, you can still enjoy a true Harvard winter from the comfort of your own home.
Studying for Classes
Being at home during the winter means no Lamont to serve as your study space for endless midterms. Fret not, you can recreate this same experience at home! Just sit at a table until 3 in the morning and feel terrible about yourself. Even without Lamont, you can still have those classic bags under your eyes and back pains to remind you that you’re probably not made to sit at the same desk for 10 hours without moving.
Wet Socks
Normally, this is around the time where you would be forgetting your boots and stepping in piles of wet snow in a pair of Vans. To enjoy this same experience, just dip some socks in cold water and put them on! Soon enough, you’ll be transported back to Harvard, cursing at yourself for forgetting your boots and wondering how long it takes to get trench foot.
Walking to the Dining Hall
Don’t you miss being able to put on all your winter clothes just for a short trek to the dining hall? At home, you can do the same! Just put on every item of winter clothing you don’t have stuck in storage. Then, walk outside in circles for a minute or two, and walk back inside, where you can begin eating. Alternatively, if you’re one of ~those people~, you can run outside in sandals and pretend that you don’t feel the cold since you’re “a different breed”. We get it. You’re originally from Massachusetts.
Eating at Tatte
Missing a nice warm drink from Tatte during this time of year? What if we told you that you could have Tatte right at home! Just take a $10 bill, burn it, and then make some avocado toast. Was it worth it? That’s for you to decide.
Canada Goose
What says Harvard winter more than Canada Goose? Time to wear one for absolutely no reason. If you don’t have one, just look up videos of them. That’s good enough, right?
Most of all, though, don’t forget to keep in touch with your classmates! Spending this winter at home may be rough, but soon you’ll be able to spend an absurd amount of time at all our favorite Cambridge restaurants once again. For those of you somewhere warmer, enjoy it while you can. Everyone else, well, stay warm.
