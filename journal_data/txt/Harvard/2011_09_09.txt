After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spring of 1976, a young woman graduated from Harvard College with a degree in History and Literature. While in school, she had acted in Noel Coward plays and had written a thesis on the unemployed in Britain during the Great Depression. On top of all this, she had contributed to Time Magazine during her years at the College and, after graduation, decided to embark on a career in journalism.
She got her start at American Lawyer and covered the 1976 presidential election for Time. Ten years out of school, she was named editor-in-chief of Legal Times, and eventually became a reporter and deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal before moving on to even greater things. Today, that same young woman—Jill E. Abramson ’76—is the executive editor of The New York Times.
In our perspective, one of the great ironies of journalism—an allegedly progressive industry devoted to public accountability and, in some cases, advocacy—has always been the historic homogeneity of its editors and reporters, who, in this country at least, have remained products of the white establishment even after the various social movements of the late twentieth century began to change social mores. Even though other industries have slowly begun to embrace diversity in the workplace, journalism continues to lag behind. In the last decade, for instance, the International Federation of Journalists released data that showed that of the 44 percent of American journalists who are women, only five percent of them occupied decision-making positions. In that sense, it’s heartening to see that Abramson has taken the helm of The Times, arguably the most prestigious news organization in the country if not the world.
From the perspective of students currently navigating the job market, the message that women can and will succeed in corporate America is among the first things recruiters assure potential job applicants. Even still, the highest ranks of the corporate ladder are, in almost every industry, predominately occupied by men—and, while we’re at it, white men. In fact, just over two percent of Fortune 500 companies are run by women (the last survey doesn’t account for Carol Bartz’s recent departure from Yahoo).
Although, of course, many women do exercise power in various capacities and in various industries, there is still much to be done in terms of equalizing the power gradient in the workplace. And while journalism doesn’t exactly fall within the boundaries of corporate America, its potential to impact society and to shape public discourse remains considerable. In that sense, we look forward to a greater diversity of voices that can shape such a collective conversation, and we hope that Abramson’s appointment will be an important step in that direction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just as groups of blockmates celebrated each others’ return last week as students returned to campus after the summer, Indian-Americans in Cambridge were rallying in favor of the 74-year-old Anna Hazare. Hazare, a so-called Gandhian activist, recently ended his 12-day fast for an anti-corruption bill in India that is, at best, an ineffective piece of legislation. At worst, it’s a damning law that will curse the government into even more crippling corruption.
In a nutshell, India has recently been plagued by discoveries of massive conspiracies that seem to extend to all corners of the government, the press, and the private sector. As much as $40 billion may have been swindled out of the government through mispricing in contracts of wireless 2G networking. And this news only follows another recent discovery that the Jharkhand chief minister had personally benefited by nearly $1 billion through an intricate corruption scheme.
In protest of this stifling corruption, India’s citizens united and began to protest. And rightfully so: The corruption and general government incompetence has slowed the speed of infrastructural development and encouraged a switch in the net capital outflow to a stunning negative.
As the millions coalesced, they rallied behind Hazare, who claimed to look for inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi, the universally respected non-violent freedom fighter and father of the nation. Gandhi was known for staging occasional hunger strikes in protest of religious strife. When he fasted, he fasted for peace.
Yet the current activists—Anna Hazare included—are doing no such thing. They are fasting for the passage of their bill, the Jan Lokpal, or “People’s Ombudsman” bill. According to some reports, as many as 150 people joined Hazare in his fast to support his cause.
But the protests are just killing Indians, and uselessly so. They do not support a credo; they simply hold peoples’ lives hostage in order to force the government to pass this bill with little negotiation or discussion. This sort of activism amounts to the near political terrorism that the Tea Partiers exhibited in the debt ceiling debates. Anna Hazare is no Gandhian. He is a media-happy fraud.
Jan Lokpal is infeasible and irrelevant. The bill calls for a selection committee of top judiciary members and parliamentary leaders. Presumably, these are the best of the best, even though recent allegations in the 2G have surfaced of the prime minister’s knowing about the dealings. But we are placing our trust in the hands of a select few who will sit on an executive bench of Lokpal, and we are trusting that they stay trustworthy—which might be idealistic.
Further, this organization would have sweeping investigation powers into nearly any branch of the federal government or private sector. In other words, the members of the bench just have to point, and their police dogs will be unleashed on whomever they choose. While the bill does provide compensation for whistle-blowers, incentivizing them to become an anticorruption militia, this might wrongly incentivize citizens in a broken system to ask Lokpal to investigate every Tom, Dick, and Harry—costs that will only get transferred to the citizens themselves.
But the biggest issue is that the bill undermines the legitimacy of the government. Yes, India is upset that her politicians ask for fees under the table as coolly as they order their lassi, but that doesn’t mean that we should support a bill that has the power to overthrow the government. Corrupt or not, the government is better than anarchy. The passage of this bill, because of its unfortunately naïve interpretations of India’s legislative needs, might promote a disastrous political end.
We need to consider new and innovative ways to combat corruption on a large scale. The chief economic advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Kaushik Basu, had an interesting idea: Instead of fining and incarcerating both the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker, why not only prosecute the bribe-taker, retrieve the black money, and give it back to the bribe-giver? In his paper, he modestly acknowledges his creative idea as “small,” but it might be able to affect profound changes to the daily bribes solicited by bent public officials.
We could follow one Hazare’s supporters, Kiran Bedi, who is encouraging citizens to carry around his trademark white hat (a favorite sartorial staple of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, as well), and wear it whenever an official approaches for a bribe.  This exemplifies a non-violent protest against corruption and an intelligent shaming technique that is more in line with Gandhi’s philosophies.
Gandhi is famously quoted to have said,  “Be the change you want to see in the world.” Hazare clearly wants to see change in the form of a proud India, without corruption. But he must redirect his admirable discipline and energy to that cause, instead of fighting just for the Jan Lokpal bill. Granted, it’s a tougher fight: While Anna Hazare’s current battle might end with the passage of the bill, that doesn’t mean the true war is won. India’s fight for corruption doesn’t end with the Prime Minister’s signature on this bill. It ends when the farmers no longer have to bribe their exchequers. When we have that India, we may break our fasts.

My interest in alternative energy technologies was sparked by an eye-opening trip to India with my family nearly seven years ago. At first, I was just upset about having to sit in 110 degree heat without air conditioning because the power was out (the local utility had instituted a program of “load shedding,” whereby it intentionally shut off power to certain districts and neighborhoods over the course of the day in order to curb skyrocketing electricity demand). However, over the past several years, as I see such problems grow worse via my annual summer trips to India, I have begun to develop a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between energy availability and economic development in one of the world’s fastest growing economies. I quickly realized that gasoline in India is several times more expensive than gasoline in the United States, so that it is often the biggest obstacle to owning a car. State governments in India schedule power cuts everyday in an effort to conserve limited fossil fuel supplies. The price of electricity is so high that energy conservation is not the product of a guilty social conscience, but a necessity to keep the utility bills manageable. And this paltry list of symptoms is just the tip of the iceberg in regards to the malaise that is pervasive in India’s energy industry.
But there is some good news. If you look at the energy policies of nations around the world, you will notice that even though countries differ dramatically in their approaches to energy policy, there seems to be one idea that many (albeit in differing degrees) have subscribed to: diversifying their energy supply portfolios to include more than just traditional fossil fuels like oil and gas. Countries around the world, including India, have finally begun to make progress in finding solutions to the energy crisis that has become a very palpable obstacle to economic growth.
They understand that as fossil fuel resources are depleted and energy prices subsequently rise; as the prospect of global climate change threatens land use patterns, strains the adequacy of our food production capabilities, and places a disproportionate adaptation burden on the populations of developing countries; as an ever increasing global population and burgeoning middle class demand cheaper  and more abundant energy supplies, it will become ever more critical that we develop a viable long-term solution to the current energy crisis. Though perceptions of scientific uncertainty plague discussions of climate change, estimates of future fossil reserves are highly variable, and the entire debate regarding energy policy has become radically polarized, one thing is certain: The laws of supply and demand ensure that fossil fuel based energy will continue to get more expensive in years to come. Hence, regardless of whether the public reaches consensus on climate change theories, basic economics urges immediate global action in regards to energy supply, if for no other reason than to keep energy prices down (nobody likes paying $4 for a gallon of gas). Luckily, as technological improvements decrease the expense of alternative energy technologies, bringing them closer to cost parity with traditional fossil fuels, many of the aforementioned problems could be mitigated in the long-term by increasing the penetration of resources like wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and nuclear.
Because other nations have already made significant strides towards implementing policies that benefit technology development, manufacturing, and demand creation for clean energy, there exists great potential for the United States to learn from and adapt such policies for domestic implementation. Germany’s feed in tariff has quickly catalyzed (though, admittedly, with its fair share of difficulties) the solar and wind industry so that renewables now supply almost 10 percent of Germany’s energy needs and Germany has the world’s highest installed capacity of solar. The United Kingdom has an aggressive policy portfolio in place that uses a mix of energy taxes, feed in tariffs, and renewable energy credits to help the country meet not only its domestic renewable energy and energy efficiency targets, but also the European Union mandates. India has instituted an innovative energy efficiency credit trading scheme, and is working diligently to improve its somewhat overambitious and confusing portfolio of renewable energy policies. Brazil, thanks to its unparalleled hydro and sugarcane resource, meets almost 90 percent of its energy needs with renewables and is especially leading the way in affordable biofuels development. And even South Korea–a relative newcomer in the renewable energy race–is pushing hard to establish a Renewable Portfolio Standard and a cap and trade program within the next five years.
Despite seeing the positive strides taken by other countries, the United States has been uncharacteristically slow to follow suit. In recent years, China has moved past the United States in total installed wind capacity, while Germany leads the world in solar. While we can, and should, applaud the efforts made by these countries, their rapid growth poses a potential problem for the United States. If we don’t regain the lead in the clean energy arena, rather than being a boon for domestic manufacturing and a solution to our over-dependence on foreign fuels, renewable energy technologies will become another foreign obligation that will strain budgets and require massive international military engagements exactly like the ones we bemoan today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson reported that this year’s freshmen were asked to sign a pledge upholding certain moral values Harvard College hopes to instill in its students. This pledge has since been referred to as the “Freshman Values Pledge” and has been a source of much campus discourse. On Tuesday, Pforzheimer House Co-Masters Erika L. Christakis ’86 and Nicholas A. Christakis opined on the freshman pledge, rightly noting that our strength as a world-class university depends on our ability to embrace the reality that “we live in an increasingly interconnected world and depend on one another.”
The Freshman Values Pledge has been in development since last spring, and was a central component of a broader Moral Development Initiative that came out of the Freshman Dean’s Office. Even if the perception that Harvard students are becoming increasingly inconsiderate to their peers is incorrect, there is certainly no harm done by exposing new members of the Harvard community to the values for which the College and the greater University stand. During their first week in college, freshmen are given the opportunity to sign on to a pledge which, in the end, really only says that they will value kindness and integrity just as much as they value their academics. Anybody who takes issue with this should perhaps examine how much they value genuine kindness and positive social interactions in their day-to-day lives before dismissing the pledge’s intent.
In dining hall conversations over the last week, I have heard some contend that the pledge is unacceptable because Harvard is first and foremost an academic institution, and should not waste its time and resources dealing with the morality of its students. This claim is fundamentally flawed. Those who come to Harvard for a purely academic education are not in the right place. Presidents of Harvard have delivered sermons on the necessity of morality in a Harvard education, and morality has been an important aspect of Harvard education for years. In the 1962 Baccalaureate Service, for instance, President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 asserted that “[character], discipline, and civic duty are not things which can be driven into a person from the outside…such qualities may grow in a person in a favorable environment if the heart set upon them.” The Graduate School of Education has its Civic and Moral Education Initiative; and the College’s Ethical Reasoning General Education requirement used to be known as “Moral Reasoning.”
Other students have griped that morality is relative, and at an international school with students from different backgrounds, prescribing one version of morality is inappropriate. This criticism is unsound as well.  The pledge is general enough that one could easily envision a system in which an honor system’s specific aspects were debated amongst current students each year and a consensus could be organically formed.
In the middle of Wigglesworth Hall on the Massachusetts Avenue side of Harvard Yard stands Dexter Gate, erected in 1890 and a favorite landmark of students and tourists  alike. According to its engraved maxim, Harvard students are commanded to “Enter to Grow in Wisdom,” and “Depart to Serve Better Thy Country and Thy Kind.” Construing the freshman values pledge issue as one borne of a useless administrative desire to establish dictatorial rule over the freshman class is not the right approach. Instead, Harvard has taken a step in the right direction to fulfill its obligations to us as students. In our formative years, we read Locke, debate questions of normative economics, write papers in comparative governance, and slave away finishing problem sets in the applied sciences. But not describing in words the ideal community–President Pusey’s “favorable environment”–in which all this should take place leaves Dexter Gate’s noble charge sadly unfulfilled. By establishing the ground rules for incoming freshmen before Convocation, we enable a better community. If these specific moral values are experientially reinforced throughout our time at Harvard, we are given a true academic and social education. If, after Commencement, we leave the Yard with integrity, respect, and—yes—kindness engrained into our minds and hearts, we are better citizens of the world and Harvard will have done its job.
Perhaps this year’s pledge is the beginning of a larger movement towards instituting a larger honor system on Harvard’s campus. If the recent debate on this pledge builds momentum for such a reform, then it will have been a success. A system that can stand the test of time and one day be spoken of with such reverence as is given honor codes of schools like Haverford, Princeton, and West Point is not one developed in one fell administrative swoop. Only with student input and acceptance will Harvard truly respect a declaration of values; something like this cannot be top-down. Instead, students and administrators need to work together to build a strong culture around an honor system for people to incorporate it into their existing value set. This is our university. Let’s seize this moment and invest our energies now into making this possible, to enable future generations to serve better their country and their kind.

AlcoholEdu, the online alcohol prevention course completed by incoming freshmen at Harvard and over 500 other American universities, is only effective in reducing harmful drinking habits of students for their first semester of college, according to a study released last week by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
Organized by researchers at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Berkeley, Calif., the study tracked self-reported alcohol use from students at a total of 30 schools—half of which mandated their students to complete the course, and the other half of which were controls that did not offer the course.
The course consists of five online modules, four of which are completed the summer before students arrive on campus, and the last in the early fall. Topics covered include the definition of a standard drink, alcohol laws, and harm-reduction strategies.
The study found that students who had participated in the online course reported reduced incidences of binge drinking, physiological problems such as hangovers or vomiting, social problems such getting into fights, and sexual assault, according to lead author Mallie J. Paschall. However, the researchers found no significant differences between the alcohol use of the two groups of students in subsequent semesters, suggesting that the program has only short-term benefits.
While the study recruited both private and public schools of varying sizes, no Ivy League schools were involved, according to Paschall.
Harvard has been using the AlcoholEdu system for six years. In addition to these internet sessions, freshmen at Harvard participate in September workshops with Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors (DAPA).
According to Paschall, one of the most effective lessons in AlcoholEdu is geared towards changing the incoming freshmen’s “perceptions of drinking norms”—namely, that heavy drinking is more prevalent than it really is.
“If you’re someone who goes out, it seems like everyone is going out every week,” DAPA Andrew J. Harris ’14 said. “It may seem, because you see a large number of people going out or drinking, that everyone drinks.”
Harris added that explaining the particulars of Harvard’s drinking culture—particularly the amnesty policy, which protects students seeking treatment for alcohol-related sicknesses from disciplinary measures—is a major focus of DAPA’s work with freshmen.
Results from this recent study support the importance of the College’s ongoing development of a “comprehensive substance abuse prevention program,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said.
“While we will continue exploring ways to support the health of our students, we will also continue to ask students to exercise good judgment,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said. “While we can educate students, they must ultimately make the right decisions for themselves and their friends.”

Six rooms in Cabot House’s D entryway were evacuated around midnight Thursday morning after a burst pipe flooded room D-41.
According to messages sent to the House email list, the water headed downward to rooms D-31, D-21, and D-11, causing more than 10 students to move to friends’ rooms for the night. It is unclear what caused the sprinkler pipe to burst.
Richard Y. Ebright ’14 of D-41 was typing on his computer when he heard a loud bang coming from the sprinkler closet in the hallway of his suite. Two of his roommates then noticed that water had built up in the locked closet and flooded into the hall, even seeping from the top of the door frame.
“[G]allons upon gallons of brown water flooded over the top of the pipes closet” Ebright wrote in an email to the Cabot open list at the time of the incident.
Ebright and his roommates sought help from House personnel to turn off the water while the fire alarm went off in their suite. Ebright also noted that maintenance staff had been working on the fire alarm system in the closet on Wednesday afternoon.
Campus maintenance personnel responded to the scene by draining the water from the closet and setting out fans to dry the affected rooms.
Emails from students offering pillows, blankets, and couch space bombarded the House email list.
The evacuated students were able to return and retrieve valuables at about 9:30 a.m. after an inspector checked the rooms, according to an email from Cabot Resident Dean Jill Constantino to the House list. At 10:30 a.m., affected students were permitted to move back in.
Though the extent of the damage will be unclear until students examine the rest of their belongings, Constantino explained that firefighters were able to minimize damage by picking up things from the flooding floor when they first walked through the rooms.
Ebright’s roommate Jaehyuk You ’14, who had gone to bed before he was woken by the sound of the alarm, said Thursday afternoon that they did not suffer much property damage from the flooding. You, a Crimson editor, said he blocked the entrance to his room with a towel to prevent further flooding inward.
“[I]t seems that we weren’t hit too bad,” Constantino wrote in an email to The Crimson.
“Cabot was great, taking back the title of Fish Bowl from Currier,” she added, reflecting on the quick response of the Cabot students who had offered the evacuees a place to stay.

Harvard College announced the appointment of its first director of bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer student life on Thursday.
Lisa “Lee” Forest, who currently heads the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Allies Pride Center at Bridgewater State University in Mass., will assume the position at Harvard in November.
The new position was created by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds last spring. At the same time, Hammonds announced the opening of a space dedicated to BGLTQ issues in Boylston Hall, replacing the Queer Resource Center in the basement of Thayer Hall, which had been criticized by students for its lack of a paid staffer and gloomy, underground location.
According to Assistant Dean of Diversity Relations and Communications Robert P. Mitchell, the space in Boylston will house a student lounge, an office for Forest, and working space for undergraduate interns at the new center and for Emily J. Miller, a student at Harvard Divinity School who was also named yesterday to the post of graduate assistant for BGLTQ student life.
Both the new space in Boylston and the creation of the director’s position sprung from the recommendations of the BGLTQ Working Group made up of students and staff which Hammonds convened last year.
Miguel Garcia ’12, a founder of the student group Gay, Lesbian, Or, Whatever (GLOW) and a member of last year’s Working Group, said he was glad to hear that an appointment had been made.
“I am very pleased with how the report of the Working Group is being treated,” Garcia said, adding that Forest faces “a huge job.”
Based on his experience in the Working Group, “I think it’s going to be a lot of work for [the new director] in determining where to start, especially considering we’re very far behind our peer institutions,” Garcia said.
In Hammonds’ estimation, the chosen candidate is up to the task. “Lisa Forest is a talented and experienced administrator who can take the College’s existing supports for BGLTQ students and make them more robust and accessible. I’m very pleased that she has agreed to take on this new role,” Hammonds said in a statement.
Though Forest did not respond to requests for comment yesterday, she said in the College’s statement that she was eager to take on the work ahead of her at Harvard.
“This new program will be a valuable resource for the campus community, and it represents an exciting new chapter in Harvard’s history,” Forest stated. “I am eager to collaborate with Harvard’s outstanding students, faculty, and administrators who have paved the way with an impressive array of BGLTQ-related initiatives, and I look forward to working together toward a shared vision of social justice.”

The total amount of money pharmaceutical companies paid Massachusetts doctors promoting their products decreased in recent years—indicating that beefed-up conflict of interest policies are shutting down the profitable circuit of speaking engagements for Harvard doctors and other medical professionals.
Total payments by pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline in Massachusetts decreased from $1.2 million in 2009 to $884,850 in 2010. Eli Lilly, another drug company, saw a decrease in its fees paid from $1.6 million in 2009 to $866,910 in 2010.
Many Harvard-affiliated doctors and researchers have cut ties with company speaking engagement bureaus, according to the Boston Globe.
Harvard medical professionals collected a significant percentage of the speaking fees doled out by pharmaceutical companies in 2009 and the first half of 2010. But recent data shows that many Harvard affiliates ceased making promotional speeches in the second half of 2010 and first quarter of 2011 as tighter University and Medical School regulations have taken effect.
“It’s not surprising that, as institutions such as Harvard say that these doctors and researchers shouldn’t be participating in these kind of speaking engagements, that doctors obey them,” said Medical School Associate Professor Eric G. Campbell, who studies the interaction of medical professionals and the health care industry.
Campbell attributed this decline in part to a cultural shift among doctors.
“For a long time in medicine, not just at Harvard, but everywhere, there was a culture that said doctors were entitled to industry perks, but that culture is breaking down,” Campbell said. “Doctors no longer assume it is their right and duty to accept these perks from industry.”
The change has been reflected in institutional policy. Over the past decade, Harvard Medical School has revised its conflict of interest policy several times, but when a recent scandal made nation-wide news, the school implemented its strictest regulations yet.
In June 2008, the Medical School was embroiled in debate after U.S. Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) reported that psychiatrist Joseph Biederman of Harvard-affiliated Mass. General Hospital had received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs he had used to treat children for bipolar disorder.
This allegation spurred the Medical School to launch an 18-month internal review process. New restrictions stemming from the investigation took effect last January.
The rules prohibit faculty from accepting personal gifts and giving industry-sponsored talks at events where the material is prepared in advance by the company. Additionally, the limit on annual faculty compensation from outside companies has been slashed in half, to $10,000.
Campbell said that Harvard has led medical schools in revising its conflict of interest policy.
“Harvard University... [has] been recognized as a national leader in addressing these issues for many years,” Campbell said. “Not every institution forbids [speaking engagements].”
Gretchen A. Brodnicki, the Medical School dean for faculty and research integrity, could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two years of concentrating on everything from cutting visiting lecturers to trimming paper supplies, departments are turning their focus back on curricular and academic development.
“It’s high time for Harvard to go back to being Harvard,” History Department Chair James T. Kloppenberg said.
Departments are strengthened by this year’s increase of 4 percent in the endowment distribution, the revenue that schools of the University annually receive from Harvard. By contrast, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences faced a 12 percent reduction in the distribution for fiscal year 2010 and an 8 percent cut for FY 2011.
Although this year’s 4 percent increase is modest in the face of the steep 19 percent drop over the past two years, department administrators have finally received some respite from the weary task of budget cutting.
“Before, we were holding our breaths when trimming budgets. Now, we can finally breathe,” History of Art and Architecture Administrator Deanna Dalrymple said.
In the December 2008 Faculty Meeting, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith presented a harrowing future. Departments were forced to cut their budgets by 10 to 15 percent, over 75 staff were laid off, and faculty searches were restricted. Department administrators became fastidious accountants, penny pinching to meet the budget standards and reduce the school-wide, two-year $220 million deficit.
At the end of the 2010 fiscal year, the deficit had been cut in half. And at the close of the 2011 fiscal year in June, Smith reported that FAS was on track to balance its budget by the end of the current fiscal year, FY 2012, with only a $35 million deficit outstanding. Smith plans to dip into the FAS reserves, which stood at $138 million in 2008, to bridge the remaining gap.
With the deficit nearly closed, FAS begins this year on a more optimistic note. With the endowment distribution on the rise, department administrators said that they have begun considering bringing back programs that were cut.
“There’s a sense that we’re getting back to the business of creating and planning—it’s not all just reduction, reduction, reduction,” said Allen Aloise, director of laboratories for the department of chemistry and chemical biology.
In particular, Kloppenberg noted the history department has begun searches for five faculty this year.
“It would not have been possible in the past few years,” Kloppenberg said. “The University financial picture looks much brighter than it has in recent years.”
Though the financial markets continue to bounce like a yo-yo, the Harvard Corporation has re-established its criteria to normalize its distribution.
The Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—used to tie its distribution more closely to the Harvard Management Company’s annual return on investments. This policy fared well when HMC’s returns regularly scored in the double digits. But as the financial crisis rattled markets worldwide, the University endowment plummeted by nearly 30 percent, reducing the distribution amount. The recent effort to maintain more consistent distributions will, administrators hope, maintain a stable payout through highs and lows.
While the endowment distribution value will finally increase for this fiscal year, administrators underscore that it will take time for departments to again receive the same amounts[funding levels] that they took in before the cuts. Last spring, FAS administrators reported the school will need until 2018 to reach pre-crisis spending levels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the three weeks since Google began hosting @college webmail accounts, 98 percent of the 5,610 students using @college email addresses made the switch.
With the exception of a few security breaches, most students reported successful shifts to the new email client.
The switch to Google’s Gmail email client was done in tandem with the merger of two Harvard information technology departments into one unit, Harvard University Information Technology.
That organization, founded June 15, united Faculty of Arts and Sciences IT with University Information Systems, bringing together over 450 Harvard staff members.
According to administrators within HUIT, the synergy between the members of the new organization facilitated the email shift.
“The combination of expertise and bench strength allowed us to make the change from one email platform to another in an incredibly short time-frame and without problems,” IT spokesperson Sarah F. O’Connell said.
In particular, O’Connell noted that the team prioritized efficiency in the process.
In mid-May, FAS IT and UIS still served as independent bodies, but together they began examining the new infrastructure for @college email.
Administrators formally decided to make the shift on June 9, hoping to get the new system in place before students returned to campus in late August.
This short time-frame required “all hands on deck” according to O’Connell, who said that HUIT even decided to put some undisclosed projects on hold.
“We are pleased to hear that this is making it easier for students to do their work,” she said.
The new infrastructure replaces the former @college webmail client, Mail2World.
While often criticized by students for being clunky and difficult to use, Mail2World, a Los Angeles-based company that the College turned to two years ago, was never meant to be a temporary fix, HUIT officials said.
In fact, Harvard considered Google when it created @college email accounts but opted for Mail2World instead.
“At the time, it was determined to be the solution that best met all of our requirements, which Google did not,” O’Connell said.
Two years ago, students expressed apprehension over perceived security threats associated with an external company managing @college emails.
“With any outside vendor, there’s a serious concern about privacy and data ownership,” Joshua A. Kroll ’09 said at the time.
But current students have not expressed the same worry.
Alaina Alvarez ’13 said she isn’t concerned about having Google manage her email account.
“It’s a school email so I’m just using it for school purposes,” Alvarez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United Airlines Flight 175 took off from Boston Logan Airport at 8:14 a.m. with brothers Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi strapped into business class seats 9C and 9D.
Thirty minutes later the al-Ghamdis and three others took control of the plane, killing two pilots and stabbing members of the flight crew in the process. At 9:03 a.m., the aircraft slammed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.
The effects of that day have been permanently seared into the national consciousness. But before the al-Ghamdi brothers helped kill thousands on September 11, they spent their last four nights sleeping, and waiting, at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge and at a Days Inn less than a mile from Harvard Stadium.
During the three months the pair spent in America—mostly in Florida—they didn’t attract attention. They had already trained in Afghanistan. Now, they had to wait.
"They dressed and acted like Americans, shopping and eating at places like Walmart and Pizza Hut. They came into different cities, moved around a lot and did not hold jobs," FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III said about the 19 hijackers, speaking before Congress.
During their time in the U.S., the al-Ghamdis had gym memberships, went to Kinko’s, paid for dry cleaning, shopped at Winn-Dixie, and bought blazers, dress shirts, and shoes.
In the four days they spent in Cambridge and Boston, the brothers kept a low profile, spending mostly cash. This picture of the al-Ghamdis’ time in Cambridge—which comes from documents cataloguing the FBI’s investigation into the hijackers—is incomplete. But through interviews and by examining phone and financial records, the FBI established a number of details.
At the Charles, they called fellow hijacker Marwan Al-Shehhi from the hotel room and pay phone outside. Al-Shehhi, the youngest of the 19 hijackers, was a hijacker with pilot training—making him a de facto leader of the Flight 175 team.
After the two brothers spent the night at the Charles—known for hosting visiting politicians and celebrities—the al-Ghamdis searched for a cheaper hotel, leaving behind a room that overlooks the Harvard Kennedy School.
According to FBI documents, the brothers rode in a taxi cab for nearly 45 minutes, looking for a more affordable place to stay. At one point, they called the Inn at Harvard to inquire about rates. Ultimately, they opted to spend the last three nights of their lives at a Days Inn.
The Days Inn, which is flooded with Harvard families during Commencement season, is 1.5 miles from Harvard Yard.
The al-Ghamdi brothers spent their time meeting with other soon-to-be-hijackers, eating at the Charles River Bar and Grill, and, at one point, ordering a pornographic movie for $12.55, according to FBI records.
On Sept. 10, the day before the attacks, the al-Ghamdis brothers followed a detailed plan for spiritual preparation in their hotel room—the same plan the other hijackers, positioned near airports on the east coast, undertook.
At 1:30 p.m. that day, housekeeping knocked on the door to room 241 for a routine cleaning. Refusing cleaning service, Hamza al-Ghamdi instead handed a maid two full trash bags. An hour later, housekeeping knocked again, and this time, the brothers allowed hotel staff to clean the room.
A maid recalled seeing three men in the room, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Ghamdi, and another man, also a hijacker.
The maid would later tell the FBI that it looked as if the men slept on top of their sheets and placed light silk clothes over their pillows. In the room, the maid discovered copious amounts of body hair and water left on the floor. The maid also noted that all the room’s lotion bottles had been emptied.
The brothers had shaved off all of their body hair, symbolically purging themselves of their sins. This was just one of many instructions provided to them, so that they could prepare for their martyrdom.
"Do not leave your apartment unless you have performed ablution before leaving," the list read in Arabic, "Because the angels will ask for your forgiveness as long as you are in a state of ablution, and will pray for you."
By 6:45 a.m., the clean-shaven al-Ghamdi brothers arrived at Boston Logan, Terminal C. A taxi driver had driven the two to the airport from the Days Inn. The brothers gave him a 15-cent tip.
That morning, 10 hijackers maneuvered through Boston Logan airport. All were cleared through security. The al-Ghamdi brothers boarded the plane with mace and knives hidden away.
They took their seats.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having already made World Championships history at the junior, U23, and senior levels, Harvard sophomore Andrew Campbell now looks to tackle his next big challenge­: the Olympic double.
“The focus is on London 2012,” he says. “I’m not rowing for Harvard right now, unfortunately, so this fall will be focused on finding a double partner and transitioning to the double ... In the spring, I will take a leave of absence and train full time to get ready for London.”
Already a star on the international scene, Campbell’s bronze medals in the lightweight single at the 2010 Junior World Championships and 2011 U23 World Championships both stand as the highest U.S. finish ever in each event. The 19-year-old also took fourth at last weekend’s World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia.
“He was doing quite well in the finals in Bled; [he] had a little bad luck with a bad oar handle,” lightweight coach Charley Butt notes.
But even with the oar handle, Campbell still posted the best U.S. finish in the lightweight single since another Charles River denizen, MIT grad Steve Tucker, took bronze in 2002.
“Each race this summer, since I’m so unproven ... was a really important stepping stone into a higher level of sport,” Campbell says. “Each was kind of a step up from the previous one, so I’m pretty proud of each race.”
Given his recent run­–which includes a victory in the lightweight single in this summer’s Elite Nationals in addition to his trials and worlds success–Campbell’s introduction to the boat may seem somewhat surprising.
“I actually originally got into rowing the single because I was the odd man out,” he explains. “When I started rowing in middle school, there were five of us that were kids my age getting involved in it. And I was the slowest out of the five, so they would go in a quad, and they would stick me in a single, because they didn’t have anywhere to put me. It’s kind of funny that I got started rowing the single because I was the worst one in the group.”
The single proved to be a perfect fit for him.
“He’s very self-motivated,” says fellow sophomore standout Michael Wales. “He has the ability to go out there and just keep going and going. He has this attention to detail, and he excels in all his classes. He is just focused on perfection. He’ll work on taking the same perfect stroke over and over.”
Wales competed against Campbell in the double in their junior and senior years, and last year the duo teamed up as stern pair of the freshman eight, which improved consistently over the course of the season.
“He has this undying will to win—that he’ll do whatever it takes to get his bow across the line first,” says Wales, who stroked the crew. “It was really awesome to have him as my seven seat; it was something every rower would want. He’s an incredible person and an extremely powerful athlete.”
Campbell and Butt are hoping that top U.S. scullers are similarly enthusiastic about rowing with the sophomore sensation.
“He demonstrated starting power, the ability to race the boat in the middle 1000, and he also demonstrated the ability to sprint,” Butt says. “I think there’s a lot of value [in rowing with Campbell] for someone who wants to have a good shot at [the Olympics].”
Campbell and Butt plan to bring several top lightweight scullers to the Charles in order to determine which double combination is most effective.
“The double’s one of those finicky boats where just because you have the two fastest singles doesn’t necessarily make the fastest double,” Campbell explains. “There’s a lot of chemistry involved, so it’s important to try out a lot of different people and see, you know, who you gel the best with.”
Then comes the hard part. To make the Olympics, Campbell and his partner will first need to win the National Selection Regatta II and then place in the top two at the Final Olympic Selection Regatta. Because the US did not place in the top 11 at last week’s World Rowing Championships in the lightweight double, the winner of NSR II will need to place in the top two at the Final Olympic Selection Regatta, a last chance race between crews that did not qualify at Worlds.
“It’s a long road—by no means easy,” Campbell says.
But while challenges await him in the future, the rower is currently taking a well-deserved break before throwing himself into his next project.
“I’m taking a little bit of time off because it’s been such a crazy run,” he says.
To say the least.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s golf team walks across the freshly cut grass of Sebonack Golf Club on Long Island, N.Y., this Sunday, it will not only be sporting new Swedish designer clothing but a fresh outlook on the upcoming season.
The Crimson will take part in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton match this weekend, which will provide an early test for a team that has added four strong freshman recruits to a roster that didn’t graduate a single person last year.
Top returners include senior Mark Pollak, who was named second-team All Ivy after taking 11th at last year’s Ivy League Championships.
Right behind him was sophomore Theo Lederhausen, who finished 13th at the event.
The team also welcomes Sam Barrington, Frederic Fisher, Jordan Mann, and Akash Mirchandani.
While in school in Workingham, U.K., Mann captained the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire County U18 Elite team as well as his school team at Wellington College.
“We are definitely confident going into this weekend with everyone returning from last year and are excited to get back out there,” Lederhausen said. “Our goal is to start off strong with a win over both Yale and Princeton.”
The Crimson is looking to improve upon last season and challenge the defending Ivy League champion Bulldogs.
“We all want to come out strong in our first outing and show how our work during the summer really helped to improve our game,” Pollak said.
The challenge that Harvard will face this weekend is one that they have prepared for all summer and fall.
“All of us worked on our game during the summer to try and improve different aspects of our game,” sophomore Michael Lai said. “We’ve even changed up our practice strategy some to become even more effective in the coming tournaments.”
Playing rival schools adds a certain fire to every tournament, even the first of the fall.
“Though this type of tournament is somewhat casual and friendly, we are going in with the mindset that we have to win to prepare us for the rest of the season,” Pollak said. “The goal is simple. Win.”
Yale and Princeton both finished above Harvard in the Ivy League Championship last year.
The Bulldogs won the tournament by 20 strokes. The Tigers, meanwhile, finished fifth, only four shots ahead of the sixth-place Crimson.
“Yale lost a key component of their team in the graduation of Tom McCarthy last year but they are still the defending champs and are going to be strong,” Lederhausen said. “That is why we have to prove ourselves with an early victory after this weekend.”
The Bulldogs still have a strong team, especially with the return of junior Brad Kushner and senior Jeff Hatten, who tied for fourth at last year’s Ivy League Championshiops.
Yale also welcomes back Ivy League Rookie of the Year Sam Bernstein, who was second team All-Ivy.
Harvard is looking to move up in the Ivy Leagues and challenge for the Ancient Eight title.
“We’re expecting and hoping to be the best in the Ivy League at the end of the season,” Pollak said. “We just have to go out and play our game every tournament and we will end up in the position that we want.”
Also on the horizon for Harvard this fall are the McLaughlin Cup in Farmingdale, N.Y., the MacDonald Cup at Yale, the Big 5 Invitational in Philadelphia, Pa., and the Windon Memorial Classic at Northwestern Univeristy in Stokie, Ill.
While the Crimson played in Farmingdale, N.Y., New Haven, Conn., and Philadelphia, Pa., last year, this year will mark Harvard’s first year at the Windon Memorial Classic.
“The Northwestern tournament will be a great opportunity for all of us because we will get to play against some of the best golf teams in the nation which will really help to show where we are at individually and as a team,” Pollock said.
Though its match with the Wildcats is in the distant future, the team has plenty to keep itself occupied in the meantime.
“If we maintain the dedication that we have had in the past few weeks, though it’s early to gauge, our team has some great potential, “ Lederhausen said. “This weekend will help us to get a feel of where we are at right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a dramatic victory that stayed undecided until less than four minutes remained on the clock last Sunday, the Harvard women’s soccer team (1-1) hopes that there is still some home field magic left as it prepares to take on Massachusetts (2-1-1) under the lights tomorrow night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
This weekend also marks the first time this season that the team will see live game action at Ohiri Field, where it will play Connecticut (2-2-0) on Sunday afternoon.
“We’ve got a couple of tough opponents in UMass and UConn this weekend,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “Of course, we would love to be 2-0 going into this weekend, but knowing that we could be 2-0 gives us all the motivation to practice even harder for these upcoming games. Plus it’s been good to go out and get some tough practice in for the rest of the season.”
“It’s always tough to give up goals like we did [last weekend], but we responded really well,” Harvard coach Ray Leone added. “It’s those types of things that you look for in a team, because that tells you whether or not they’re going to give up or fight for the win.”
Last season, Harvard defeated the Minutewomen, 3-2, but since then UMass has added one big piece to their roster, senior Julie Morrissey. Morrissey, a transfer from the University of Cincinnati had nine game-winning goals in three years, including five as a freshman.
The senior is already off to a hot start this season, leading her team with three goals in her first four games.
She scored both goals in UMass’ 2-1 victory over Elon last week, with her first game winner as a Minutewoman coming against the Phoenix in the 84th minute.
“The season is still young, so we haven’t gotten to see too much real game action,” Baskind said. “These games [are] against some really tough opponents, but we’re really optimistic about how we’ve done so far and looking forward to how we’re going to do this weekend.”
Recent history favors the Crimson, which has won the last three meetings between the two schools, But with new talent combined with veteran leadership on both sides, it could be anyone’s game.
“Being an Ivy League team, we’re at a slight disadvantage compared to these teams because we’ll be playing our third game of the season while they’re already six or seven games in,” Baskind said. “We might be playing some catch-up, but we’re definitely up for the challenge.”
The Crimson’s opponent on Sunday is no slouch either. The Huskies defeated UMass, 3-2, in an exhibition game earlier in the season.
UConn comes to Ohiri Field behind the leadership of senior goalkeeper Jessica Dulski, who was named the Big East Goalkeeper of the Week due to her performance in the recent Wake Forest Nike Challenge.
Dulski recorded 16 saves against two nationally ranked opponents in the tournament, tallying 11 saves and a 2-1 win over No. 18 Wake Forest and holding off 5-0-0 No. 25 Virginia Tech admirably before giving up the sole goal in the game in the 80th minute.
“We’re working together right now to get up to speed for the season,” Leone said. “We played hard these last couple of games, and we practice hard. It’s still early in the season, but we’re doing all we can to make sure we get to where we want to be.”
“We’re hungry this year, and we’re not going to settle for anything less than the top,” Baskind added. “This is the first time that this senior class has not started the season as the defending champions of the Ivy League. It’s my goal this season to make sure that this does not become a trend, and we’re going to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Right back here in Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been raining all week in Cambridge, and now the Harvard men’s soccer team is about to be hit with a red storm.
Coming off a dramatic season-opening win against Northeastern on Sunday, the Crimson (1-0) travels to Queens, N.Y. tonight to take on No. 25 St. John’s (2-1) in what will be an early-season test for a Harvard team looking to reestablish itself as one of the nation’s elite.
“St. John’s is a really good team, and they pressure the ball really well,” explained junior forward Brian Rogers, the team’s leading scorer in 2010. “If we get rattled, if we get disjointed because of that pressure, then it’s going to be a long night, but if we’re able to keep our composure and play our game and withstand the pressure, then I think we’ll have a lot of success.”
After falling to No. 2 Maryland in its season-opener, the Red Storm responded with road wins against then-No. 8 William & Mary and Boston University before returning home to face the Crimson tonight in what will be the first-ever meeting between the two teams.
St. John’s is led offensively by senior Pablo Battuto Punyed, who tied for the team lead with five goals last season. Junior Jack Bennett has paced the squad thus far with four points on two scores, both of which were game-winners. In net, sophomore Rafael Diaz returns after sporting a 0.84 goals-against-average as a rookie and has five saves on the year thus far.
Last season, after winning its first two games, the Crimson went 14 consecutive matches without scoring more than one goal. On Sunday night, the team again struggled to generate any offensive firepower until the 82nd minute, when Rogers broke a scoreless tie with his game-winning score.
If Harvard is going to win against a tougher opponent this evening, Rogers says a faster offensive start is imperative.
“We struggled a little bit with this last year,” the junior explained. “Offensively we didn’t score that many goals. It was something as a team we worked on a lot over the offseason; it’s always easier to win a game if you score early. It gives your team extra energy and deflates the opponent.”
But getting off to a quick start in Queens will be no easy task, as St. John’s allowed just three shots-on-goal in its recent pair of shutout wins, including zero against the Terriers. Red Storm senior Connor Lade is coming off a Big East Defensive Player of the Week accolade.
“We’re not going in there scared at all,” senior midfielder Jamie Rees said. “We’ve got to go in and play well. It’s going to be hard because it’s on the road but we’ve done it before.”
Two days later, the Crimson will come back home to play Rhode Island in a Sunday afternoon contest. Coming off a 3-13-2 season, the Rams (1-4) have gotten off to a slow start once again in 2011, losing three one-goal contests before being trounced, 4-0, at Florida Gulf Coast last time out.
In 2010, four players paced the team with just two goals and four points, while senior Peyton Warwick allowed 2.07 goals-per-game. This season, freshman Matt Sykes and junior Matt Ribbens lead the team with 13 and 12 shots, respectively, while sophomore Joey Haught and senior Franco Lo Presti have each scored a goal.
That Rhode Island offense will attempt to make something happen against Harvard senior goalie Austin Harms, who was brilliant in recording his 17th career shutout against Northeastern. Though the keeper finished sixth in the conference in goals-against-average last year, continued strong performances from Harms would go along way towards mitigating the Crimson’s offensive struggles.
“As long as we’re winning games, we’re happy,” Rees said. “I think we know that [points] will come ... [and] as long as we don’t give up any goals, we can’t really lose.”
Facing a squad that went 0-9-0 on the road last season, Harvard knows Rhode Island is a team it should beat at home.
“I think they have some talented players, and they’re a team that’s looking to bounce back,” Rogers said. “It’s definitely going to be a hardworking team, similar to Northeastern, and a team that we can’t have a let down against after a big game against St. John’s if we want to beat them.”
After witnessing how a 2,500-person crowd can help will a team to a dramatic victory, Rogers knows the importance of home field and believes the momentum stemming from the Northeastern game has the team going in the right direction heading into this weekend.
“It was a great way to open the season,” the forward said. “Winning is something that’s contagious, and when things are going well people are more optimistic, there’s more confidence, so I think we’re all excited.”

The road wasn’t friendly to the Harvard men’s soccer team tonight, with the Crimson dropping its first away game to No. 25 St. John’s, 2-0.
Playing at Belson Stadium in Queens, N.Y., the Red Storm (3-1) came out strong on the offensive, putting Harvard (1-1) immediately under pressure. After the 17th minute, St. John’s took five corner kicks in nearly the same number of minutes, with junior midfielder Ido Ligety ultimately converting on a header to give the Red Storm the lead. The St. John’s defense limited the Crimson to one shot in the first half, ending the period with a 1-0 edge.
And the Red Storm showed no signs of letting up, continuing to challenge the Harvard defense in the second half. Less than six minutes into the period, senior forward Walter Hines tallied another point for St. John’s with a chip shot from 12 yards out off an assist by freshman midfielder Daniel Herrera. Although the Red Storm had seven corners in the latter half to the Crimson’s one, the Harvard defense stayed strong to keep the final score at 2-0.
St. John’s outshot the Crimson, 14-3, in the match, with senior goalkeeper Austin Harms recording five saves for Harvard.

If you put in the work, Harvard is not only a school where one could end up with an exceptional degree, but also a decent husband. Harvard recently ranked in YourTango.com's list of top ten colleges for finding a husband.
The website prioritized factors such as school rankings, graduate salaries, and alumni generosity as metrics for quality husband hunting.
 
Harvard was chosen alongside Stanford, Princeton, and Williams College. Williams was selected as a result of its ranking as the number one liberal arts college in the country and its high mid-career salaries. Harvard was chosen for its notoriety as the number one university in the nation, as well as the "legacy factor" in admissions.  Aside from Harvard and Princeton, no other Ivies made the list (a noticeable lack of Yale, one might note).
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: September 10, 2011
The September 9 post "Harvard Ranks on Top Colleges for Husband Hunting" incorrectly identifies Harvard as fourth in YourTango.com's list of top ten colleges for finding a husband. The list is, in fact, unranked.
