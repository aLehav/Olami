After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As reported in The Crimson on Tuesday, various members of the Committee on Women, Gender, and Sexuality are saying that the next step for WGS at Harvard is to become a full-fledged department. We could not agree more.
Founded in 1987, WGS—for the last quarter century—has brought to the Harvard community voices and perspectives typically underrepresented and often ignored in the academy. It is high time that the University officially recognize the value of this discipline by transforming it from a degree-granting committee into a department on equal footing with its peers.
Of course, WGS is not the only discipline embodied in degree-granting committee. In fact, there are nine of these, which include interdisciplinary fields such as Social Studies, History and Literature, and Folklore and Mythology. In advocating for the departmental recognition of WGS, we are in no way denying the value of these other committees or arguing that they do not deserve the resources that departmental status affords. We merely believe that WGS—because of what it represents—deserves recognition now.
Our reasoning is not based on the impressive fact that WGS courses are increasingly popular: After all, the number of undergraduates enrolled in these offerings rose from 388 in 2008-2009 to 545 last year. Nor does our argument rely on the reality that some students are made to pursue WGS-related plans of study elsewhere in the University because the current committee cannot always provide them with the breadth, structure, and faculty supervision they need. While these are credible reasons themselves, they do not address the heart of the issue. In other words, WGS must become a department because a university ostensibly committed to “Veritas” has an obligation to support, promote, and advance perspectives that add to the collective conversation inside its gates in order for that conversation to influence and even improve the larger societal conversation outside its gates.
Although committee-status does not necessarily imply a lack of commitment on the part of the University, the University has the opportunity to join the ranks of the few universities across the country that has recognized this discipline with departmental status. It should go without saying that questions of gender and sexuality are common to all cultures and all periods of history, and it is time that Harvard recognize the universality inherent in the study of women, gender, and sexuality.
To that end, making WGS a department would afford the program several key advantages it currently lacks. It would enjoy greater resources than it does as a committee, the ability to craft a more substantial body of course offerings, and the ability to have more faculty tenured in the discipline itself rather than in a different department. All of these changes would encourage more students to encounter this area of study, and an official WGS department would bring the study of women, gender, and sexuality the increased support and recognition it deserves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am on Facebook while I am writing this article.
We college students all use our Facebooks in a mostly banal way: to send dumb links to friends, to keep tabs on exes, to look at pictures of others (and, let’s be honest, ourselves). We use Facebook to interact with people in ways that we couldn’t otherwise—though I’m not convinced that my life would be incomplete without most of those modes of socializing.
This statement may seem like an indictment of social networking; I certainly thought so, before I interned at Facebook this past summer. My job was with the global policy team based out of Washington, D.C., focusing on policy challenges that Facebook confronts around the world, with a particular focus on Asia. I learned a tremendous amount about many issues and opportunities that confront social networks around the world, from telecom regulation to the way that people from different cultures conceptualize identity online.
But the single thing that changed my understanding of social networking the most came from an unlikely quarter: Studying and thinking about how these sites could be used in developing countries. People with less social and economic opportunity than those of us who attend Harvard can certainly use Facebook in all the everyday ways that we do. However, they can also take advantage of the things that social networking sites do best—connect people, spread information, facilitate openness—to transform their lives.
In the developing world, many problems are exacerbated by the inability of crucial segments of the population to connect with their larger demographics. From working women who are the first generation in their countries to take on senior management positions to doctors working to combat the spread of tuberculosis in rural regions, social information is a crucial resource. Social networking sites, as they gain penetration outside of developed countries, are just beginning to be used in this way. We have barely begun to see how bold thinking about how to use social technology can help to overcome economic and social barriers in the developing world.
One example of these uses is a Facebook Page—“Cambodian Women in Business”—with nearly 2,000 fans. “Women in Business in Cambodia have created this page to share experience in doing business and working in the Kingdom,” the page description reads. “We also hope this page will be a good platform to network, support each other's activity but [as well] to celebrate our success.” Women are able to discuss issues they face, strategies for dealing with common problems like misogynistic bosses and sexual harassment, and to make connections that have real professional value.
Pages like “Cambodian Women in Business” serve as a useful model (and, indeed, could easily be replicated in many other countries where professional women are increasing in number but facing difficult workplace dynamics). But even more creative uses of social technology are possible.
This next wave of uses of social media could take projects that international development organizations such as the World Bank and USAID fund, and amplify their impact through leveraging sites like Facebook, Google+, and Orkut, which have rising penetration around the world. Let’s say the World Bank is working to bring doctors in East Africa who are combating the spread of tuberculosis into contact with each other, to monitor the spread of the disease from village to village, and provide early warning, as well as to facilitate the sharing of best practices. Rather than creating a separate website, the World Bank should go to where the doctors already are—Facebook—and create a page that serves as a location for this information sharing and networking.
This kind of use could be replicated for other diseases, from AIDS to the West Nile Virus, anywhere in the world, for essentially no cost. And there are many other uses, far more than space permits in this article: for a village of basket-weavers in Thailand to access a global consumer base, for dissemination of information about infant care or water potability standards, and so on. Even more importantly, as mobile uses of social technologies are on the rise, computer access is not even necessary to access these incredible potential resources and to participate in the development projects that these platforms can support.
College students were the initial Facebook users, who showed that a service that initially resembled a dating site could be used to drive political change, economic opportunity, and connection across great distance. We can also help to push this next wave of uses for social networks.
Many people on campus are involved in advocacy for the developing world; these programs and projects should count social networking tools as key strategic assets. Students who spend time abroad during the school year or over the summer should encourage their friends to think about using the Internet creatively and ambitiously. International students should not only connect online with their friends back home but also publicize at Harvard the causes that those friends are rallying around. All of these efforts will help spur people in developing countries to take advantage of the full panoply of twenty-first century resources that are available to them.
They are on Facebook while you are reading this article—and thank goodness.

The crowd was flush against the stage, close enough for our conductor to crowd surf, should he have chosen to do so. From the back, behind the timpani I was playing, I could see that the audience was an odd, mud-smeared crew—a mixture of college students and middle-aged alumni-turned-flash-mob dancers. We had waited backstage in Memorial Church for hours before the lightning subsided enough for us to begin performing. It felt reminiscent of some strange Woodstock, and I wouldn’t be the only one to think so.
But I’m no rock star. I am a percussionist in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO). We were not about to share the stage with Jimi Hendrix and Santana, but rather with President Drew G. Faust and Yo-Yo Ma ’76. They had visited us earlier to make sure we were staying focused for our performance at Harvard’s 375th birthday celebration on Oct. 14. Members of the Glee Club serenaded President Faust with an impromptu a cappella jam; Mr. Ma called us to arms before our great battle with the ferocious elements in Tercentenary Theatre. Our adrenaline was pumping. Or maybe that feeling was indigestion from the Welsh rarebit HUDS had served at dinner that evening.
In general, being an orchestral musician is not that cool. On more than one occasion, I have uttered the phrase, “This one time at band camp,” because in reality, I’ve been to band camp. In fact, I’ve been to several band camps, on numerous instances even, so I occasionally reference a story that might seem funny as someone who has been to band camp but that, in reality, is deeply unfunny to most everybody else. Sometimes, selling tickets to fellow students for my orchestra concerts is like pulling teeth out of somebody who doesn’t have any teeth. If they do agree to come, I am surprised by such a disarming gesture. Orchestral music is decidedly unsexy, a truth I will just have to accept until the New York Philharmonic is invited to perform at Yardfest. (They had an easier time going to North Korea.)
But while classical music may not always be in style, it is other things: significant, beautiful, historic. This is why HRO and members of Harvard’s choruses were asked to perform excerpts from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 at Harvard’s birthday party.
We began with the second movement. It is fast, upbeat, and likely familiar to many members of the audience. Throughout the Yard, screens depicted images of Harvard over time. Spectators shouted enthusiastically from the front row, ignoring the normal decorum of orchestra concerts. After a brief pause, we started into the famous “Ode to Joy” theme of the final movement. They began to applaud, in a delayed moment of recognition reminiscent of live recordings from “Best Of” albums. The classical music energized the crowd, though the brightly colored lights shooting across Tercentenary Theatre probably helped, too. When the chorus entered for the final two excerpts—a recapitulation of Ode to Joy, then the Prestissimo finale—the audience lost all control. This was their favorite song! At least, temporarily.
Then, to shrieks from the audience, Yo-Yo Ma ascended the stage. A modern-day Elvis on the cello, Mr. Ma is a real rock star among musicians, an exception to the nerdiness often associated with classical music. His appearances at Harvard and elsewhere are highly anticipated affairs. Mr. Ma performed two movements from Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1, his amplified cello only enhancing his rock star status. He might as well have been playing “Living on a Prayer.” Instead, he opted to end with own rendition of “Happy Birthday.” The crowd went wild.
After the performance, I maneuvered through the crowd, sizing up the atmosphere at the celebration. Harvard certainly had its own take on the normal sights of an outdoor concert. Thousands of slices of red velvet cake and vendors handing out socially conscious snack bars replaced the Zippo lighters and marijuana fumes one might expect at such festivals. After sinking my concert shoes into the mud apparently serving as a moat for the chocolate fountain tent, I found firm ground on the steps of Widener Library. From there, I had a perfect view of the Jimmy Vali Band, which skillfully performed covers of popular songs by Journey and Michael Jackson. The crowd loved them. Normally, I might have been jealous. But that night, I didn’t resent the band. Because for one evening, classical and rock musicians could share the same stage. For once in my life, I could finally feel like a rock star.

As the United States continues to face a spiraling deficit and attempts to “do more with less,” the spotlight has rightly fallen on our nation’s leaders to creatively cut spending and look for new revenue. The legislative “supercommittee” charged with the formidable task of trimming the federal budget is currently combing through thousands of financial commitments, each valued by some segment of the national population. This fundamental reassessment of our nation’s finances will ultimately impact all of our lives in many startling and subtle ways. For example, we may have to wait on the phone a little longer to speak to a representative at the IRS. We will probably not receive as comfortable a social security check as our grandparents, if we receive one at all. We will eventually be forced to pay higher taxes regardless of any unlikely miracle of budget policy. Nobody likes longer lines, cut services, or higher taxes. However, in confronting such challenges and developing creative cuts to spending, America must not sacrifice its longstanding commitment to the international community and its established leadership in the United Nations.
As the World population is set to eclipse the seven billion mark on October 31st, the challenges of food scarcity, environmental sustainability, and health remain dire. One could provide pages of statistics on devastation in Somalia, flooding in Thailand, or the resurgence of polio. Security issues and questions of governance continue to plague Africa and Central Asia and fledgling democracies struggle in the Middle East and North Africa. With an ever-increasing population and increased challenges with global repercussions, the United States cannot abandon its commitments to international aid and engagement. On the world stage, America has been a leader, ensuring peace and security, promoting democratic values and rule of law, and improving countless lives through investments in health and infrastructure. Now is not the time to sacrifice American foreign aid for isolationist policies under the banner of cost-cutting.
While I do not reject the need for reform or ignore the organization’s inefficiencies, the United Nations is the only global body and forum for all nations to discuss and develop solutions to the world’s problems. Over its 66-year history, the U.N. has accomplished much in many fields including eradicating smallpox, controlling nuclear technology, improving woman’s rights, managing trade relations, reducing child mortality, adopting environmental protocols, and more. Yet, the United Nations needs sustained leadership and funding to deliver success in such initiatives. Much of that funding comes from contributions of its member states, especially the United States (about 22 percent of the U.N. budget).
The United Nations (as well as aid programs in general) has come under scrutiny of congress and political campaigns in the past. As the international community is not a registered voter and politicians are eager to show commitment to a domestic base, the United Nations and other expensive international projects are often criticized in political rhetoric. For example, the U.N. Withdrawal Act of 1995 went so far as to require the removal of the U.N. headquarters from New York. Although the bill failed, it highlighted America’s general anxiety of international organizations—namely, questions of American sovereignty and national interests. Yet international apprehension at the bill also highlighted America’s critical leadership role in world affairs and the responsibilities inherent in that role. The United Nations, the only global forum inclusive of all nations, faced extinction should the United States give up on the project.
This month, the House introduced a similar bill to restrict United States’ commitments to the U.N. “The United Nations Transparency, Accountability, and Reform Act of 2011” would make U.S. contributions to the United Nations voluntary and reduce all U.S. contributions by fifty percent if the U.N. does not receive 80 percent of its international contributions on a voluntary basis. Interestingly, the text of the bill unilaterally requests reforms of various U.N. bodies for continued U.S. participation and specifically withholds funds from any U.N. entity that recognizes the existence of Palestine. Luckily, the bill has no chance of passing. It should, however, serve as a wake-up call for the State Department to pursue cost-cutting reforms of the United Nations though effective auditing and removal of bureaucratic inefficiencies. Such a multilateral approach will ultimately allow us to expand our international leadership, show that the United States is committed to international engagement, and in turn achieve constructive U.N. reform for the betterment of all nations as well as the U.S. treasury.
On the domestic level, the Federal government must eliminate its own inefficiencies by cutting duplicate positions and reassessing priorities. It must increase communication and shared resources between departments to learn to “do more, with less.” We all can agree that the United States needs to confront its financial difficulties, yet it cannot come at the expense of decades of international engagement and leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students made a case for the recognition of Harvard’s fraternities and sororities as official student organizations during a meeting of the Committee on Student Life on Thursday morning.
The conversation comes at a time when students and administrators alike look to find a place for a growing Greek presence in Harvard students’ social life.
During Thursday’s meeting, members of Harvard’s Greek organizations laid out what they saw as the benefits of recognition, ranging from the ability to use College space for philanthropic events to the promotion of inclusiveness by utilizing the student activities fair to advertise Greek life.
Phillip J. Morris ’12, president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, called Thursday’s CSL meeting “very productive.”
“What’s frustrating for me is that I don’t feel like the conversation has seriously occurred about the college’s policies regarding recognition before,” Morris said.
Harvard has not recognized sororities and fraternities since 1984, when the College revoked their official status due to the gender-discriminatory recruitment practices of the social organizations.
Administrators cite the gender discrimination policy, as well as Greek groups’ ties to national organizations, as reasons why the College is unable to recognize Greek life—concerns echoed by Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson during Thursday’s meeting.
During the meeting, Nelson indicated that she has met with fraternity and sorority members about recognition for Greek organizations in the past, telling the student leaders present that “not a lot has changed since the last time we talked.”
Nelson promised to share the contents of their presentation with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
“I was a little frustrated that we came out, essentially, in the same administrated place that we started in,” said Bonnie Cao ’12, UC vice president and a member of Delta Gamma, of the meeting. “But what got me really excited is that I think it gave us the chance to really talk one-on-one with the deans, administrators, and House Masters and address the concerns they may have about Greek life at Harvard.”
Cao and UC president Senan Ebrahim ’12 proposed that Greek recognition be the topic of Thursday’s meeting given growing student dialogue about fraternities and sororities as Harvard’s Greek scene continues to expand.
During the past two years, Greek organizations have become increasingly popular as social groups on campus. Last spring, a record 268 women rushed Harvard’s three sororities, representing the largest rush class in Harvard history, according to sorority leaders. In 2008, The Crimson reported that the sorority rush class averaged about 150 people.
Fraternities also reported an increase in numbers—over 100 men attended Sigma Chi’s first rush event and about 72 signed into SAE’s first event, according to each fraternity’s leader. Both declined to provide rush numbers from past years.
As of this year, five of Harvard’s six Greek organizations possess real estate near Harvard.
Greek members cited the growing interest in Greek life as further evidence for why the College should reevaluate its relationship with sororities and fraternities.
“[Recognition] is a step-by-step process and I think we made a huge step today by really getting in the same room with some of the decision makers and really getting to address their concerns. From there, hopefully, will come recognition,” Cao said. “Starting that conversation is a huge step.”

Alan A. Khazei ’83 dropped out of the Massachusetts Senate race Thursday, citing difficulty raising funds in a field dominated by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren.
“She has struck a chord, no doubt about it,” Khazei said of Warren to the Boston Globe. “It’s definitely affected my position. So fundraising has been tougher, and in terms of attention ... It’s challenging. Things have definitely shifted.”
Khazei’s departure all but guarantees that Warren will be the Democrat to challenge Sen. Scott Brown next fall. And, if fundraising and polling are any indication, Warren will put up a strong fight against the incumbent Republican. Warren raised more money than any other Senate candidate in the nation during the third quarter, bringing in a total of over $3.15 million, dwarfing Brown’s $1.55 million. Polls conducted earlier this month show that Warren trails Brown by five points or less.
In polls of the Democratic primary, however, Warren leads other candidates by 30 points or more. Still, many—including Warren—expressed shock when Khazei quit the race. Khazei vowed three weeks ago to fight Warren until the end—pointing to the over $365,000 his campaign raised in the second quarter. But in October, “the money dried up,” according to spokesperson Scott Ferson.
“At some point, we were not going to be able to sustain the campaign,” Ferson said.
In addition to fundraising difficulties, Ferson said that Khazei, after positioning himself as a candidate of the people and against establishment Washington, had trouble gaining support in a field opposite Warren, who is known nationally as a fierce advocate for the middle class.
Announcing the end of his campaign on Thursday, Khazei slammed Brown but declined to endorse his Democratic rival.
“I’ve said throughout this campaign that Scott Brown does not deserve to be re-elected because he has failed to lead when our country is crying out for game-changing leadership. I don’t want to do anything that could prevent the defeat of Scott Brown in 2012,” Khazei said at a press conference on Thursday.
Warren, who said she was surprised that Khazei quit the race, praised his many years of public service in a statement released after the announcement.
“He has set the standard as a leader who listens and gets results with innovative ideas and new approaches,” Warren said.
Like Warren, Khazei has extensive connections to Harvard. Khazei, who is an alumnus of both the College and the Law School, founded the service organization City Year while living as a tutor in Currier House. In 2006, Khazei returned to campus as an IOP fellow.
Khazei is not the first to quit because of trouble raising money. Newton Mayor Setti D. Warren and activist Bob K. Massie also ended their campaigns due to lack of funds.
This is the second time that Khazei has unsuccessfully run for the Senate. Two years ago, Khazei ran in the special election to fill the vacated seat of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 but lost in the Democratic primary to Martha M. Coakley. Khazei was the only candidate from that race to return as a challenger to Brown.

Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz defended on Thursday Israel’s decision to secure the return of captured soldier Gilad Shalit in exchange for the release of around 1,000 Palestinian prisoners as part and parcel of Israeli democracy, something that he said Western observers do not take sufficient care to understand.
Dershowitz made the remarks at a talk alongside Rabbi Jonathan H. Sacks, the chief religious leader of British Jews, and said that Israel’s decision to agree to a swap represents a vital democracy insofar as the movement to secure Shalit’s freedom was a popular one that was led by his family and carried out in the court of public opinion.
“No matter what we may think in the halls of academia ... ultimately, the decision has to be made by Israelis,” Dershowitz said.
Many observers have criticized Israel’s choice to release a large number of prisoners in exchange for Shalit’s return, a decision that many say will lead to further kidnappings of Israeli soldiers to be used as bargaining chips. Dershowitz pushed back against American criticism of Israeli policy by saying that American critics of Israel do not adequately take into consideration Israel’s status as a democracy, which he said entitles it to a greater degree of independence than some of its critics grant.
In the wake of the exchange, Dershowitz and Sacks both said it was important for Israel to retain its Jewish identity even in the hailstorm of conflict, adding that the long-standing tension between Israelis and Palestinians should, in principle, be able to lead to a sense of understanding between the two peoples.
“If there is anyone on earth who should be able to understand Jewish struggles, it’s Palestinians,” Sacks said. “And if there is anyone on earth who should be able to understand Palestinian struggles, it’s Jews.”
Dershowitz said that while the conflict is headed in the wrong direction politically, it is moving in the right direction intellectually.
“It can’t be based on ‘it’s our home’ or ‘it’s your home,’” Dershowitz said. “It’s the home of both people and both people have to live in peace with each other.”
Both Sacks and Dershowitz, two highly vocal advocates for a Jewish state, recognized the difficulty of the conflict. For all their expertise on the matter, neither Sacks nor Dershowitz had a clear view of whether the effort to achieve peace is progressing in the right direction.
Both men said that there was an inevitability to the tie between the Jewish people’s history and today’s Israel. Because Jews are unique in their perpetual homelessness, Israel remains a product of Jews’ history of trauma and expulsion, Sacks said.
“Jews discovered that there was not one inch on the face of the planet that they could call home,” Sacks said.
“It’s hard to see how, in a world in which there are 56 Islamic states and at least 82 Christian states, there isn’t room for one Jewish state,” Sacks added. “Whatever criterion you use, Jews have a right to this very small space.”

A recently released book by Harvard Kennedy School Economist Ricardo Hausmann and MIT Physicist Cesar A. Hidalgo claims to offer the best model for predicting the economic growth of nations.
The colorful, 362-page volume—entitled the “Atlas of Economic Development” is filled with bright graphs and figures representing the economies of each nation.
Hausmann and Hidalgo chose to represent economic complexity visually, saying that the brain is much better at processing graphical representations than manipulating symbols. “We are exploiting the part of the brain best suited to absorbing information,” said Hausmann.
The atlas ranks 128 nations on “economic complexity,” a measure that describes the diversity of a country’s knowledge and how it is combined for the economy to grow.
“It has incredible properties,” said Hausmann. “It explains why countries are poor or rich, and predicts which countries will have an easy time of growing and which countries will face headway in expanding knowledge.”
Every country in the atlas is illustrated by a “product space,” a web of nodes that represents its economy. Each node signifies one product; they are color-coded based on industry and clustered near other nodes that require similar pools of knowledge to make.
“By looking at the product space, we can predict not only how fast countries are going to grow, but which industries they’re going to enter and which industries they’re going to exit,” said Hidalgo. “The predictive power of economic complexity, when it comes to future economic growth, is a thousand percent more effective than measures of education, governance, or competitiveness.”
The atlas predicts faster economic growth when countries have a greater difference between economic complexity and income. China, India, and Thailand top the rankings for “expected growth percentage of GDP in 2020.”
“Surprisingly, several East European countries, such as Belarus and Ukraine, rank highly in the measure, as well as Mexico, which is contrary to most economic models,” said Hausmann.
Although the U.S. comes in 91st place for expected growth, the model projects that the U.S. will still contribute the most—22 percent—to world GDP growth through 2020. The U.S. economy was ranked 13th most complex overall.
The authors said they hope that their research is used by countries to maximize their economic development.
“We would like people to use this to better understand the position of their countries in the global economy based on what they’re making, not necessarily how much, to then strategize better when making decisions of how to allocate businesses and how to help their economy more forward,” Hidalgo said.

Bates College will rename its nearly century-old Bates College Chapel “The Peter J. Gomes Memorial Chapel” in honor of Harvard’s late Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister at Memorial Church.
Gomes, who graduated from the Maine liberal arts school in 1965, was a frequent preacher at the chapel to be named in his honor, and a friend of many in the Bates community.
“Peter Gomes is adored still at Bates. He so loved this college,” said Reverend Bill Blaine-Wallace, a multifaith chaplain at Bates. “Having a friend like Peter certainly made me feel blessed.”
Blaine-Wallace’s connection with Gomes was indicative of the close ties the late Reverend Professor maintained with the Bates community.
When Blaine-Wallace first arrived as a minister at Bates in 2006, a letter from Gomes awaited him on his desk, Blaine-Wallace said. Gomes wrote that it would be a privilege to serve at Bates and that Blaine-Wallace should not hesitate to contact him if he needed anything. Blaine-Wallace said he took up Gomes’ offer, consulting him mainly on pastoral matters.
Gomes was a frequent visitor at Bates, last speaking in the chapel at the college’s 2010 reunion.
In a 2005 piece published in Bates Magazine, Gomes described one of his first experiences in the chapel, which occurred soon after he matriculated.
“I shook my father’s hand, kissed my mother, and then they drove off. I went back into the chapel to cry in privacy,” Gomes wrote. “There I saw a tall, spare, bald-headed man slowly picking up the litter in the pews. I took him to be a janitor. He noted my distress, and in a solemn but friendly voice said that I’d soon feel better about college.”
The man turned out to be Dean of the Faculty Harry W. Rowe, who remained friends with Gomes for the remainder of his life.
Speaking at the college’s reunion nearly 50 years later, Gomes still saw the chapel as a central place for his relationships at Bates.
“True reunion is not just a meeting of those who may be walking around, but is that reconnection with those whom we do not see, whom we do not hear, but whose names we know,” he told the audience.
The Bates Chapel is a Gothic house of prayer open to all religious faiths complete with a 36-stop organ and stained glass windows depicting mostly secular figures.
Bates plans to officially dedicate the chapel to Gomes next spring in a series of events in his memory, according to Blaine-Wallace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students made a case for the recognition of Harvard’s fraternities and sororities as official student organizations during a meeting of the Committee on Student Life on Thursday morning.
The conversation comes at a time when students and administrators alike look to find a place for a growing Greek presence in Harvard students’ social life.
During Thursday’s meeting, members of Harvard’s Greek organizations laid out what they saw as the benefits of recognition, ranging from the ability to use College space for philanthropic events to the promotion of inclusiveness by utilizing the student activities fair to advertise Greek life.
Phillip J. Morris ’12, president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, called Thursday’s CSL meeting “very productive.”
“What’s frustrating for me is that I don’t feel like the conversation has seriously occurred about the college’s policies regarding recognition before,” Morris said.
Harvard has not recognized sororities and fraternities since 1984, when the College revoked their official status due to the gender-discriminatory recruitment practices of the social organizations.
Administrators cite the gender discrimination policy, as well as Greek groups’ ties to national organizations, as reasons why the College is unable to recognize Greek life—concerns echoed by Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson during Thursday’s meeting.
During the meeting, Nelson indicated that she has met with fraternity and sorority members about recognition for Greek organizations in the past, telling the student leaders present that “not a lot has changed since the last time we talked.”
Nelson promised to share the contents of their presentation with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
“I was a little frustrated that we came out, essentially, in the same administrated place that we started in,” said Bonnie Cao ’12, UC vice president and a member of Delta Gamma, of the meeting. “But what got me really excited is that I think it gave us the chance to really talk one-on-one with the deans, administrators, and House Masters and address the concerns they may have about Greek life at Harvard.”
Cao and UC president Senan Ebrahim ’12 proposed that Greek recognition be the topic of Thursday’s meeting given growing student dialogue about fraternities and sororities as Harvard’s Greek scene continues to expand.
During the past two years, Greek organizations have become increasingly popular as social groups on campus. Last spring, a record 268 women rushed Harvard’s three sororities, representing the largest rush class in Harvard history, according to sorority leaders. In 2008, The Crimson reported that the sorority rush class averaged about 150 people.
Fraternities also reported an increase in numbers—over 100 men attended Sigma Chi’s first rush event and about 72 signed into SAE’s first event, according to each fraternity’s leader. Both declined to provide rush numbers from past years.
As of this year, five of Harvard’s six Greek organizations possess real estate near Harvard.
Greek members cited the growing interest in Greek life as further evidence for why the College should reevaluate its relationship with sororities and fraternities.
“[Recognition] is a step-by-step process and I think we made a huge step today by really getting in the same room with some of the decision makers and really getting to address their concerns. From there, hopefully, will come recognition,” Cao said. “Starting that conversation is a huge step.”

An 18-year-old MIT freshman was discovered dead in his dorm room on Tuesday afternoon.
Satto Tonegawa, a son of a Nobel Prize-winning MIT professor and a cum laude graduate from Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., is the second MIT undergraduate to be found dead in a dormitory this school year.
University and law enforcement officials declined to provide details about the circumstances of his death.
The death does not appear to be suspicious or involve foul play, said Cara O’Brien, a spokesperson for the Middlesex district attorney’s office.
O’Brien said the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will conduct an autopsy to find out the cause of death.
MIT’s student newspaper, The Tech, reported that Tonegawa had not been seen for a week prior to his death. Some students said they had noticed a strange odor near his room.
“This is a very sad situation, and the entire MIT community shares a deep sense of loss and grief,” MIT Chancellor Eric Grimson said in a statement. “Our thoughts go out to the family, friends, classmates, and dormmates of Satto, as well as to the graduate resident tutors, housemasters, and others in the student-life system who knew and worked with Satto.”
Susumu Tonegawa, Satto’s father, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1987 for work on the genetic mechanism that creates the diversity of antibodies. He could not be reached for comment.
Hidde Tonegawa, Satto’s brother, said in a statement to the Boston Globe that the family is struggling to understand what happened.
“Everyone’s still in shock,” he told The Globe.
Those who knew Tonegawa in high school said he was not only bright and talented, but also kind and sincere.
“If you didn’t know him, you probably thought he was quiet,” said Doriane Ahia ’15, a classmate of Tonegawa’s at Milton. “But he was a really smart, funny, and nice guy. He had a lot of friends who cared about him, and that just shows how great a person he was.”
Ahia said she had a few classes with him in their freshman year.
“It’s surreal that I will never see him again,” Ahia said. “You never expect something like this would happen to someone you know.”
Grant M. Jones ’14, who knew Tonegawa since the third grade, agreed.
“Satto was always super gentle, very kind, and clearly extremely smart.”
Jones said he learned of Tonegawa’s death when he saw several friends’ statuses about the death on Facebook.
“One of the statuses said, ‘RIP Satto,’ and I thought, ‘That couldn’t be right,’” he said.
“He was such a happy-go-lucky, awesome guy. He was very kind and sincere.” Jones added.
An exceptional pianist and a cellist, Tonegawa was selected to perform at Carnegie Hall while in high school. He was the recipient of Milton’s Science Prize, which is awarded to students who have demonstrated “enthusiasm as well as outstanding scientific ability” in physics, chemistry, and biology.
He was one of 24 in a class of 180 students to graduate cum laude from Milton Academy.
Tonegawa is the second student in just two months to die at MIT. In September, sophomore Nicolas Del Castillo died in an apparent suicide, just three days before classes began.
According to a 2000 report in The Tech, MIT’s suicide rate among undergraduates was well above the national average. More recent data were not available.
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention showed that the national average in 2008 was 11.84 suicides per year for every 100,000 people. Comparatively, the MIT undergraduate suicide rate from 1996 to 2000 was 18.1 per year for 100,000 students.
Paul J. Barreira, director of behavioral health and academic counseling for University Health Services, said the rate at Harvard is fewer than 5 per year for 100,000 students.
Barreira added that Harvard has created new freshman workshops to introduce students to a variety of mental health resources available on campus. Harvard also conducts depression screenings in the dining halls every fall.
“Besides giving away free J.P. Licks gift cards, there are three things we aim to achieve,” Barreira said. “To reduce stigma in talking about depression and anxiety, to raise awareness of the symptoms, and to find students who are depressed and have not been treated.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor Emeritus Richard S. Rosenbloom ’54—who served on the faculty of Harvard Business School for 40 years—passed away in New York City on Oct. 24.
Fellow Emeritus Professor Thomas K. McGraw described Rosenbloom as passionate about technology, saying it was no accident he was the inaugural occupant of the David Sarnoff
Professorship, named for the father of color television. Over his years at the Business School, Rosenbloom taught courses on innovation and the management of technology.
His son Joshua L. Rosenbloom, himself a professor at the University of Kansas, said he once watched his father in class and was awed by his ability to engage the students.
Joshua said his father never stopped teaching, even at home. Discussions at dinner would often include someone running to get an encyclopedia to settle a dispute. He would also frequently point out how customer service and management could be improved. “But it was never direct—it was always in a very gentle, instructional way,” Joshua added.
During a stint as director of research at HBS, Rosenbloom excelled at allocating the School’s research funds, colleagues said.
“He had a very good sense of what kind of project would work. Dick was replaced with four people—that’s what a big job he was doing,” McGraw said.
Professor Joseph L. Bower ’59 noted Rosenbloom’s instinctive ability to carefully consider big decisions. “Sometimes it’s easy when the place is busy to just do things casually, but he would never do that. It was wonderful for HBS that he was there making decisions,” Bower said.
Richard Selig Rosenbloom was born in 1933 in Springfield, Mass. He came to Harvard as an undergraduate, and then chose to stay at the University his entire career.
Emeritus Professor Stephen A. Greyser ’56, who entered Harvard College two years after Rosenbloom, noted that Rosenbloom kept the same phone number from the time of his undergrad days at Lowell House, eventually passing it onto his daughter Rachel, who still lives in Cambridge.
“He was a very devoted member of many different communities—the HBS, Harvard, Cambridge, and Jewish communities,” Greyser said.
During his days working at WHRB as an undergrad, Greyser noticed that Rosenbloom, the student head of the radio station, stood out as a leader even among a college full of them. Later, Rosenbloom continued his involvement as chairman of the WHRB board of trustees. He also served as Chairman of Harvard Hillel.
Above all, however, Rosenbloom will be remembered as a tireless mentor and supporter, Professor Regina E. Herzlinger said. Herzlinger, the first tenured woman at HBS, met fierce opposition when she first attempted to begin teaching. “The dean couldn’t picture a woman teaching; he thought riots would break out,” she said.
But Rosenbloom, the only colleague with whom she discussed the situation, was adamant in his support of her.
“He was incredibly prescient,” she said.
Professor Clayton M. Christensen, too, noted that Rosenbloom had influenced or nurtured today’s most prominent scholars in the field of technology and innovation.
“One of the world’s greatest mentors of the next generation is gone, and that puts the onus on the people of my generation to do what he did for us,” he said.

Teenagers who consume large amounts of soda are more likely to display violent tendencies, according to a study recently conducted by David Hemenway ’66, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Hemenway, along with his co-author, University of Vermont Economics Professor Sara J. Solnick ’86, found that teens who drank more soft drinks were between nine and fifteen percent more likely to be violent.
The study’s results were published in Injury Prevention, an international peer review journal.
The research was conducted using questionnaires collected from over 1,800 inner-city Boston public school students between the ages of 14 and 18. The majority of the students were African-American, Hispanic, or interracial and came from similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
Among other questions, the students were asked how many non-diet soft drinks they consumed in an average week, whether they carried weapons of any kind, and whether they had been involved in violent acts.
According to Hemenway, the questionnaires covered many different aspects of violence. These included witnessing violence and fearing violence, as well as partaking in violence.
“The more soda the students drank, the more likely the students were to perpetrate violence,” Hemenway said. “It was violence in all areas—against peers, against dates, against siblings—and they were even more likely to carry guns.”
After finding the initial correlational relationship, the researchers set out to control for a number of other factors, including gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index, alcohol use, tobacco use, and sleep. Hemenway said that several of these factors—particularly alcohol and tobacco use—are themselves heavily associated with violence.
Yet after this analysis was conducted, “the relationship [was] still there and ... incredibly strong,” Hemenway said.
According to Solnick, previous studies have suggested that soft drinks have been linked to mood disorders in teenagers.
However, Solnick said that there is not enough data to firmly conclude that soda is a direct cause for an increase in violent tendencies. High soda consumption may simply indicate a poor diet in participants.
“People who drink a lot of soda are missing out on other proper nutrition, and that may lead to aggression and violence,” Solnick said.
Solnick said that she and Hemenway will continue their research by looking at other types of violence, studying the relationship between soft drink consumption and suicidal behavior or self-harm.
“There are so many different factors that contribute to the problem, and we want to untangle all of them,” Solnick said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite winning a national title in April and a flurry of subsequent rumors that Radcliffe Rugby would be granted varsity status, the Black and White will maintain its club team status for the foreseeable future, according to Assistant Athletic Director Kurt K. Svoboda.
Members of the women’s rugby team and representatives of the athletic department have been holding private meetings over the course of the past year to discuss Radcliffe’s progress as a team, and although the Black and White’s officers proposed to the Athletic Department last year that the team be promoted to varsity status, the possibility has since been ruled out, according to team captain Megan A. Verlage ’13.
“The Athletic Department has been meeting with our women’s club rugby program, which asked us to help them in some aspects, to see how we can help them put forth a program that meets their needs,” Svoboda said in an emailed statement on behalf of the department. “Varsity status has been mentioned among other elements that could help students in this program,” the statement continued.
Though he confirmed on an earlier occasion that varsity status has been ruled out as an option for the team, Svoboda declined to comment on whether it would be considered in the future.
Verlage said the officers of the rugby club were told in a meeting last semester that due to financial constraints, the Athletic Department will be unable to fund another fully fledged varsity team.
“During the Athletic Department meeting they said, ‘No, you are not going varsity, and don’t spread rumors that you are,’” Verlage said.
Two sources on the team, who both asked to remain anonymous to protect their relationship with administrators, said that due to the confidentiality of the meetings, Radcliffe’s varsity status has become a highly sensitive issue. Members of the team, they said, have been instructed not to speak to the media about the topic.
“We got another email [from Verlage] today saying not to talk to the press about it—it’s obviously a really sensitive issue,” the first source said.
According to Verlage, the team originally wanted to become varsity in order access certain athletic resources only allotted for varsity teams. But through negotiations with the athletic department, the Black and White has been granted access to these resources, lessening the need to attain varsity status, Verlage said.
“I will [say] right now we have no intention of going varsity,” Verlage said. “We asked [the Athletic Department] for a trainer and weights, things club sports don’t usually get ... We have everything we need, so right now we don’t want to go varsity.”
But according to members of the team, it remains a contentious topic among club members. While some players are satisfied with the additional resources granted by the Athletic Department, other players believe that Radcliffe’s recent success warrants a promotion to varsity status.
“The girls on the team are talking, and some of them are upset that we’re still not varsity,” the second source said.
The source said certain members of the department have encouraged Radcliffe officers to continue to fight for varsity status, indicating that there is some dissension within the department over whether the team should be promoted.
Svoboda said he is unaware of such discussion within the Athletic Department.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When English Professor Stephen L. Burt ’94 was an undergraduate at the College, his choices about where to purchase textbooks were largely limited to Harvard Square. Burt, like the majority of Harvard students at the time, used the Coop to buy all his coursebooks each semester.
Since the rise of internet sales, Harvard Square has seen a decrease in the number of bookstores, but the Coop still remains the sole seller of official textbooks for Harvard University classes, except for foreign books. After a significant decrease in textbook sales and criticism from students about high prices, the Coop is now debating what role it should take. The Coop released a survey on Wednesday to all members asking this question.
“We see this time as an inflection point. We want to see what opportunities there are to better serve as we go forward,” says Jeremiah P. Murphy, Jr., the president of the Coop. “We’re putting everything on the table.”
HISTORY OF THE COOP
In 1882, students in conjunction with University professors tired of Harvard Square businesses’ inflated prices, and decided to pool their capital together to buy books and supplies for students cheaply and with little overhead.
“The University did not provide those materials and students thought maybe we can provide this function and do it better collectively,” Murphy says.
The Coop continues to run as an independent entity from the University, collecting all information from Harvard courses directly from faculty, according to Harvard’s Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin.
The Coop operates as a cooperative society, which means it is owned by its members and its structure its predicated on a rebate that has certain tax implications. The Coop has over 55,000 members, including 22,000 students from Harvard and MIT, who pay $1 to receive a membership card.
“Going in to the Coop as a freshmen and getting my Coop card printed out for me with my name on it was like I was initiated into being at Harvard,” says Elly Brinkley ’13-14.
The Coop used to serve as a department store and had its own pharmacy, tailor, and dry cleaning services when the Square was less competitive. But its foundation was always selling books.
However, the Coop has altered its product offerings in the last few decades. After the 1970s, when the college began to enroll women, the Coop no longer catered its sales only to men. In the 1980s, more competition came to Harvard Square, causing the store to drop out of the music industry when it had once been the largest seller in Harvard Square. In the 1990s, the Coop focused on being an academic bookstore that sells some department supplies.
In 1995, the Coop entered into an agreement with Barnes & Noble that made the company its manager of operations. Before the 1960s, the Coop’s board, comprised of students, non-students, and a president, made the decisions on what the store sold until they hired professional managers.
“The board sets the policy, direction, and strategy, and the managers implement it,” Murphy says.
While the Coop is still the brand, the software that sells and keeps tracks of the books is Barnes & Noble and the sales people are Barnes & Noble employees.
Through this agreement, the Coop has been able to expand its tradebook business and better organize business, according to Murphy.
PROVIDING TEXTBOOKS
As the main provider of textbooks for the University, the Coop collects the International Standard Book Numbers for all books. This service has been required of all schools that receive federal financial assistance, as part of a 2008 amendment in the Higher Education Opportunity Act.
“Because the Coop is the primary purveyor of textbooks to Harvard students, the University did enter into an agreement with the Coop last year to ensure compliance with a new federal mandate requiring better disclosure of textbook pricing information to students,” Galvin says.
Providing the ISBN numbers allows students to easily purchase their books at other stores or online. In 2007, a group of Harvard students protested for the Coop to publicize the ISBN list for Harvard courses. When the Coop refused, the students went to the store to copy names and ISBNs.
“We didn’t have a problem with them doing it, but just don’t come here in the middle of rush period,” Murphy says.
The Coop now provides this service for the University for free.
Students and professors have criticized the Coop for having high textbook prices. Murphy acknowledged the markup, explaining that the books must be priced higher  than in internet sales to cover overhead costs.
“We think the price is fair relative to the cost and our value. Is it competitive to what we find online? No, you can always find a book cheaper somewhere,” Murphy says.
The Coop experimented with selling textbooks at cost in the spring semester of last year, but saw no significant increase in purchases.
“It’s a scandal. I buy textbooks, which are very specific and research-oriented, and they are much cheaper. I don’t understand why textbooks can be so expensive. It’s a mystery to me,” says Oliver R. Knill, who teaches Math 21a.
While some students refuse to purchase books from the Coop, others value the store for its location.
Brinkley sees value in going to the Coop and seeing all the books in one place.
“I’ll go to the Coop and look at what books there are as a way of shopping,” Brinkley says.
Due to Harvard’s shopping week, many students do not know their class schedule until study card day. The proximity of the Coop allows students to buy their books immediately, instead of waiting for shipping from an online source.
“If I want to get started on my reading early, I purchase the books immediately there. I do believe it has high prices, but I’m willing to pay the premium there,” says Patrick M. Duffy ’12-13.
Some courses, including Life Sciences 2: Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy, require books that are custom made by professors with only select chapters. These books are only available at the Coop.
This fall, the Coop began renting textbooks. Across the college textbook industry, bookstores are offering more options to students, including new, used, digital, and most recently, rented materials.
Aleah C. Bowie ’13 rented a book for Anthropology 1010: The Fundamentals of Archaeological Methods and Reasoning this year.
“Unless you really want to save a book, it’s really the best option,” Bowie says.
Even before the Coop began renting, Bowie took advantage of online renting websites.
Instead of selling the book back to the Coop as used, students can rent it at about 50 percent of the retail price, according to Murphy.
The issue with renting textbooks is that in order to meet profit margins, books must be rented multiple times, which can be a problem when new editions are frequently released.
Approximately 35 to 40 percent of the books at the Coop can be rented, and approximately 20 to 25 percent can be purchased as used, according to Murphy.
Murphy sees the benefit of with working with Barnes & Noble on the rented books program. Barnes & Noble’s partnership with universities across the U.S. means that if a Harvard coursebook is only assigned for one year, Barnes & Noble can transfer the books to another store for future rentals.
The Coop pays all profits from member purchases after taxes and operating expenses to its members. Each year, the rebate changes. There are years when the Coop does not have a rebate. This year, the rebate is 8.5 percent after receiving over $42,000,000 in annual revenues.
However, many students do not pick up their rebate checks and fail to take the discount of the rebate into consideration.
“When you’re buying the book, you don’t think about the rebate. I completely forget about it until they send it,” Bowie says.
“The concept of a rebate is confusing and not well communicated, and we want to address that. We’ve been questioning what is the best value. We’ve had a rebate since the founding, but maybe we should have different discount structure,” Murphy says.
OTHER BOOKSTORES
The Coop is not the only provider of textbooks for the University. Schoenhof’s provides all foreign books.
“This relationship was like a gentlemen’s agreement. Because we were a niche, the University decided that we would be the one who provided foreign language course books,” says Store Manager Eleni Sacre.
Schoenof’s opened in 1856 and has remained a small, family-owned business that provides coursebooks based on professors’ requests. The store caters to students by offering a 20 percent discount on European publications and 10 percent discount on domestic publications.
While the number of bookstores in the Square has decreased from 26 to 3 in the most recent decades, the Harvard Book Store is another milestone bookstore, founded in 1932. Although the store does not keep many textbooks in stock, it will order any book that a student requests.
“We don’t in a classical sense provides textbooks to students. We’ve always viewed the Coop as that place,” says Harvard Book Store Owner Jeffrey Mayersohn ’73.
The bookstore sells standard literature, which can often be seen as the coursebooks for English classes. As a humanities concentrator, Brinkley can purchase the majority of her coursebooks at the Harvard Book Store to support local business.
While the Coop sells tradebooks too, Mayersohn sees it as a friendly competition. The Harvard Book Store also does custom printing through their bookmaking machine dubbed Paige M. Gutenborg.
Mayersohn says some professors use the machine to print coursepacks and students have printed their theses or their own novels.
Professor of Armenian Culture James R. Russell uses the machine to print specialized Armenian materials that are not longer copywrited for his courses. The Harvard Book Store also has access to all the scanned books from Widener for print.
Brinkley noted that the Harvard Book Store could never replace the Coop in textbook sales since it could not handle the volume as a small independent store.
“Problems are inherent in big university bookstores. The alternative to the Coop is Amazon. There just isn’t a viable independent,” Brinkley says.
Regardless of the changes the Coop makes, students and professors see a purpose in having the Coop and other bookstores.
While libraries also offer some course books, Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology Jeff W. Lichtman says he sees an advantage to having a bookstore.
“In a library, not all the textbooks in the same fields are in the same place. There’s an advantage to seeing that and being able to purchase new editions,” Lichtman says.
“The Coop serves multiple purposes. It provides a place of social gathering with an academic focus and scholarly atmosphere,” says Russell, who often does work at the Coop Café.
The Coop’s board will meet again in December to discuss a plan of action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the southwest corner of Harvard Yard, graduate students and alumni sipped Dudley Daiquiris and snacked on Dudley House-themed green and yellow candies Thursday evening, as part of the 20th anniversary celebration of Harvard’s graduate student center.
Dudley House, founded in 1991, provides a meeting place and social center for the 4,000 students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
University President Drew G. Faust spoke at the event, and thanked the graduate students for their dedication to scholarship.
“The best thing about Harvard University is the people who are in it.” Faust said.
“We have to make sure that all those students have a chance to intersect with one another.”
Faust also joked about the weather conditions—which were similar to those at Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebration two weeks ago—by saying that she was “a little sad” to see that the graduate center had the foresight to holds its festivities indoors.
According to Dudley House Master James M. Hogle, Dudley House was founded as an “experiment” and was designed to give students in GSAS a communal space to relax and interact across disciplines.
The house employs 25 graduate students, who serve as Fellows. They collectively host events including art and music classes, outings to Boston, intramural sports, monthly book clubs, and theme parties.
“In general the offering are so diverse that people often find they will be participating in one way or another,” said Coordinating Fellow Anshul Kumar.
Another attendee, former Dudley House Master and GSAS Alum Everett Mendelsohn, said there was no real common space when he came to graduate school in the 1950s.
“One of the things we had in mind as masters was to bring into the house some of the things we missed as grad students,” said Everett, who is also a History of Science professor.
The House’s offerings now include a dining hall, game rooms, a cafe, and even a shower.
“It really is a place for students to come and take a break,” said Graduate Student Council President Cammi N. Valdez.
Some in attendance had Dudley House to thank for more than just its social offerings. Graduate students Katie M. Rose and Jonathan Ruel met at the 2008 Spring Swing Party hosted by Dudley house. They are now married and expecting their first child.
Rose and Ruel are in different departments, and if Dudley House did not exist, they say they may have never met.
According to Dudley House Administrator Susan Zawalich, who has been working at the house for 19 years, Rose and Ruel’s case is not unique.
“Several couples who meet here have married,” she said. “The place means a lot to the students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students emphasized the importance of representing oneself, not just one’s ethnic group, in an panel discussion entitled “Ousiders Allowed” on Thursday night. In particular, the discussion focused on the ways in which “outsiders”—or students that are of different racial, religious, and ethnic backgrounds—are perceived when they participate in other on-campus cultural organizations.
The six-member panel consisted of a diverse group of Harvard students who were all members of different social and cultural organizations, and was moderated by Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña.
In defining the meaning of the word outsider, panelists stressed that outsiders were not merely people who did not fit the majority religious, ethnic, or racial makeup of a student group.
Rather, they said that the term outsider can refer to students of the same background who simply do not feel comfortable or identify in groups in which they share cultural commonality. Basing the definitions of outsiders on physical and cultural characteristics undermines the individual diversities of students within these groups, they said.
“Within the Harvard Islamic Society there are individual pockets of ethnicities and sects of Islam that have varying types of practices and understandings about what it means to be Muslim,” said the organization’s president, panelist Rashid M. Yasin ’12, offering an example of how diversity exists even within religiously, ethnically, and racially homogenous student groups.
Ravi N. Mulani ’12 and Ge “Andy” Zhang ’13 held the distinction of being the only two panelists representing student groups in which they were ethnic or racial minorities.
But both students said that despite their ethnicity and race, they did not feel like “outsiders” within their organizations.
As the only Asian board member of the Black Men’s Forum, Zhang is not the first or only non-black member of the organization. In detailing how he joined BMF, Zhang said, “I really missed having cultural discussions,” of his earlier time as a member of the Asian American Association.
“One thing that drew me to BMF was the discussions they had about what it meant to be black or a minority at Harvard.”
For Mulani, his involvement with the Asian American Brotherhood extended from his search to find people with whom he felt most connected—despite the fact that he is the sole South Asian member.
“I’ve been in other organizations where I was ethnically a fit, but not one socially,” he said.
Beyond the discussion on outsiders, panelists spoke about the need for students to join organizations whose people, core values, and overarching purpose they most related with as well.
“I think it’s important for underclassmen to try different things and keep an open mind and people within social groups should be open to accepting new types of people,” said Zhang.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are worse ways to begin a school year than a week of undefeated competition in international hockey in Vierumaki, Finland. Competing for the U.S. national team at the 12 Nations Tournament in August was as good of a preparation for the upcoming season as juniors Josephine Pucci and Jillian Dempsey could have hoped to find on campus.
Now back in Bright Hockey Center, the duo are using their experience at the national level to raise the team’s performance on the ice.
“The level of play was much higher,” said Dempsey of the national team. “The game was definitely faster. You had to make quicker decisions with the puck and play faster and play bigger.”
While Dempsey felt that playing for the U.S. team helped her speed up her game, Pucci had a somewhat different takeaway.
“It’s not always best to go at full speed and not be aware of the right play,” she said. “Every situation calls for a different speed ... hopefully this coming season, I’ll be able to adjust accordingly,.”
Dempsey and Pucci have already had to adjust quickly. In the past two seasons, they were precocious underclassmen. Last year, the skaters were the only Crimson players on a senior-laden squad to earn first-team All-ECAC honors. Dempsey and Pucci were also the team’s first and third leading scorers, respectively.
As the team’s most highly decorated returning players, the duo will be responsible for leading the younger athletes on their respective ends of the ice. Pucci is an assistant captain, along with junior goaltender Laura Bellamy.
“She’s someone I look up to,” freshman defenseman Michelle Picard said. “She definitely is one of those players who makes everyone around her better.”
Dempsey, who was voted the team’s Most Valuable Player for the 2010-2011 season, will have heightened responsibilities with captain Alisa Baumgartner currently sidelined by a shoulder injury.
“I think it’s just a little more pressure, but ... if there wasn’t any pressure, it wouldn’t be as much fun,” Dempsey said. “I think the biggest thing is going out on the ice and working hard.”
Teammates and coaches say work ethic is one of Dempsey’s strengths.
“Jillian Dempsey is also one of those kids who just works hard—no matter what—and makes things happen on the ice,” Picard said.
“They are two pretty intense kids,” Stone added of Pucci and Dempsey. “Their work ethic is unbelievable, and it gives them a lot of confidence. That brings it back to us, and we hope it is contagious for all of our kids.”
Dempsey and Pucci have taken full advantage of the offseason both years to bolster their game. This past April, Pucci and Coach Stone helped the U.S. National team win gold at the International Ice Hockey Federation World Women’s Championships, along with alumnae Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08.
Dempsey and sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman later joined Pucci that summer to train for the Women’s National Festival, and Pucci and Dempsey were both selected to compete under Stone at the Four Nations Cup.
A drawback of Harvard’s success at the national team level is that Stone, Pucci, and Dempsey, along with freshman Michelle Picard, will miss away contests against league rivals Colgate and No. 3 Cornell on account of the Cup, which will take place this year in Nykoping, Sweden.
The trio and rookie will be especially missed in the Crimson’s game against the Big Red. Cornell, the two-time defending ECAC champion, lost in the NCAA championship game to University of Minnesota Duluth and made the Frozen Four last season.
“When they go to the Four Nations Cup, we’ll be without them for a weekend,” Bellamy said. “It’s an invaluable experience; they’ll come back playing good hockey … and be that much stronger and faster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the finals of the 2011 Women’s World U18 Championship, freshman Michelle Picard and classmate Sarah Edney suited up against each other as captains of their respective national teams. And although Picard’s American squad took home the gold over Edney and Team Canada, both defenders capped off their final year of high school by earning international hardware.
Donning the Crimson uniform for the first time, Edney and Picard will join forces and help the Harvard women’s hockey team compete for the top spot in the ECAC this season.
“We’re excited to see what they will bring to the college level,” said junior defender Josephine Pucci, who will serve as one of the Crimson’s assistant captains this year. “They’ve been pushing us on the ice and adding that great positive attitude and ... enthusiasm on the ice.”
The dynamic defensive duo will be joined by two Minnesotan forwards and goaltender Tiana Press as incoming freshmen look to improve upon a 2010-11 season that saw the Crimson end its year just shy of an NCAA berth.
Freshman forwards Sami Reber and Hillary Crowe—both of whom were top-10 finalists for Ms. Hockey last year, an award given to Minnesota’s top female high school hockey player—also bring valuable experience to the ice for a Harvard team with only one senior.
“[Having such a young team] is almost better for freshmen,” Reber said. “It makes us have to step up and not so much play like freshmen on the ice. We’re young all around, so we don’t want any freshman to be scared to rush the puck and play with confidence.”
The talented recruiting class appears poised to make an immediate impact on the ice this season, as the Crimson carries a relatively small roster of 18.
“This year, because we have such a small team, the five of us are going to have to step up and play with no transition period and be ready to be thrown in there,” Picard said.
Despite boasting an array of national and international experiences on the ice, the freshmen must adjust to the pace and style of college hockey quickly if they hope to help Harvard compete with the best of the ECAC.
“It’s a big transition,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Our kids are doing a great job of getting on board, communicating with one another. The strength and conditioning piece of it is a whole other commitment level, so I say they’re getting there.”
Harvard has set its sights on its first ECAC victory since the 2008 campaign, and rookies will likely play an integral role in that quest. But luckily for the Crimson freshmen, veterans on the team have been leading the way.
“It’s hard to come in as a freshman and to play with confidence,” Reber said. “The situation we’re in, our teammates are incredible and they’ve helped us out a lot.”
Picard—along with Pucci and junior forward Jillian Dempsey—will have a unique opportunity to get more international experience under her belt during the 2011-12 campaign, as the trio was recently selected to compete for the United States at the Four Nation’s Cup this year. And despite removing three key players from Harvard’s lineup for a weekend, the competition will likely aid the Crimson in seeking national contention this season.
“I’m really excited to be able to play at that level, although I’m bummed we miss a weekend of Harvard hockey for it,” Picard said. “All of those players [on the national team] are amazing. I hope to learn something and be able to bring it back. I want to go there to play hard and get better and bring it back to Harvard hockey.”
Leadership is key on any team with underclassmen outnumbering veteran players. And although the upperclassmen are few in number, the squad’s lack of experience is not as great as one might think, as most of its returners have seen considerable action in at least one season at the college level.
“We’re a young team, but the leadership is great,” junior goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “Our captain, Alisa Baumgartner, has done a great job as a senior to show [the freshmen] how it is coming in. The junior class is seven kids strong, so we’ve been trying to as well.”
Harvard will need all 18 of its players, including the five freshmen, if it hopes to contend for a national title this season.
“All of us are going to have to step up, every grade, every position, because of how young we are,” Pucci said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team is used to having a few seniors to look up to for guidance and example. But this season, the Crimson has just one senior: captain Alisa Baumgartner.
Baumgartner has had to step into a leadership position on the team this season after being the sole player in her class since her sophomore year.
“The reason why this team looks ready to play is because of her,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She’s gotten the team to [put in work] off the ice, and her commitment, attention to detail [exemplify] what it means to be a Harvard hockey player. Thus far, [she] has been a tremendous captain.”
The senior said that the transition has been a bit challenging, but that the experiences she has had on the team in the past three years have prepared her for her leadership role.
“In high school, I came from a [senior] class of nine, so going to a class of one is … tougher,” Baumgartner said. “I’ve been the only one in my class for the past three years, but…[there aren’t] really class distinctions on our team.  And … the seniors, [from] my freshman year, really taught me what it means to be part of Harvard hockey.”
Baumgartner has set the tone and expectations of the small but close-knit team for the year.
“The culture of Harvard hockey separates us from a lot of other ... teams throughout the league,” Baumgartner said. “Everyone is part of the team. It doesn’t matter if you’re a freshman [or a] senior; everyone is expected to contribute. Everyone’s a leader in their own way.”
Baumgartner will have to wait to showcase her hard offseason training.
A shoulder injury in the offseason has prevented her from handling a puck while she is on the ice.
“[Injury is] really hard when you [have] worked so hard at a sport,” Baumgartner said. “It’s been part of your identity your entire life and then, the last season, you have to give it everything you have and move on to whatever you’re going to do in life. It’s hard to watch from the bench.”
Baumgartner’s shoulder injury kept her from playing in the Crimson’s first exhibition game against McGill last Saturday, a 3-1 victory for Harvard.
Although she has to stay on the bench while she recovers, Baumgartner has refused to let it keep her down.
“I’m slowly getting back into practices,” Baumgartner said. “The only thing I can do is be positive and try and get my teammates fired up for the season and keep them motivated and keep them positive.”
Although Baumgartner can’t touch a puck until she has healed, she has been working hard to stay active with approved training, so that she is ready to go when her injuries heal.
“She’s been working so hard … she’s lifting with us, she’s on the ice with us,” junior defenseman Josephine Pucci said. “She’s sacrificing so much time … Her heart [is] totally in it … She’s positive for the team. Even though she can’t be there [playing] on the ice with us and doing everything we do, she’s still such a strong presence. It takes a lot to be able to do that with the amount of setbacks that she’s had.”
Freshman forward Sami Reber agreed that Baumgartner remains a strong leader and continues to encourage the team.
“Her leadership on and off the ice, being the only senior on the team and being hurt, is incredible,” Reber said.  “She really motivates everyone … She’s working her butt off to keep in shape and to get back at it. We all know she’ll be ready to go as soon as she’s cleared to play. She’s done an incredible job as captain so far.”
Stone is looking forward to Baumgartner’s recovery, so the captain can build off her  2010-2011 season, in which she accumulated three goals and six assists.
The team graduated five of its top 11 scorers, making Baumgartner’s return to the ice even more important.
“We want to get her into the lineup, but she’s incredibly valuable whether she plays or not,” Stone said. “She’s been a huge piece of how this team has gotten up to speed so quickly.”
Baumgartner has received support not only from her teammates but also from team alumnae as she takes on the challenges of the upcoming season.
“I’ve already received a lot of emails from alumnae who have already graduated,” Baumgartner said. “Just words of support … It’s going to be a new challenge for me, but I’m ready for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team enters the 2010-11 season with the same ambition it always has.
“Our season goal every year is a national championship,” junior defenseman Hilary Hayssen said. “We set the bar high because you have to have high expectations for yourself.”
Harvard—which enters the season ranked second in the highly competitive ECAC—graduated four of its top six point scorers.
But the cupboard is not bare for the Crimson.
A talented crop of freshmen and ample returning talent should fill the holes left by the graduates, including forwards Kate Buesser, Liza Ryabkina and Katherine Chute, and defensemen Leanna Coskren.
A pair of juniors should figure prominently into the equation: forward Jillian Dempsey and defenseman Josephine Pucci. Dempsey led the team in points last year with 28, and Pucci led the team with an impressive +/- of +24. They also combined for five game-winning goals.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle Harvard will have to overcome will be its youth. The roster includes 18 women, five of whom are freshmen, and only one senior, captain Alisa Baumgartner. A strong group of juniors will have to step up and take on an increased leadership role.
“The biggest thing we can do is support Alisa,” junior goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “There are seven of us, but we’re very well represented positionally. We’re hoping for a lot from Kaitlin Spurling, Dempsey, and Margaret Chute offensively. Defensively, three of our six defensemen have two years of experience … The best, biggest thing we have is [the ability to] represent all of the positions.”
Having upperclassman leadership spread across different positions should help the talented group of freshmen adjust—something they will have to do quickly.
“We’re really fortunate this year to have six strong defensemen,” Pucci said. “The two freshmen that came in—they have a lot of experience, but they’re going to need to step up and not play like freshmen.”
The five rookies, including defensemen Michelle Picard and Sarah Edney, will have to do more than just integrate themselves if the Harvard women hope to achieve their lofty goals.
“We don’t have freshmen,” Hayssen said wryly. “The freshmen can’t be freshmen. We’re too young for that.”
Luckily for the Crimson, its youngest class is seasoned both in high school and national competition.
“We have a great recruiting class coming in with two national team defenseman, two forwards, and a goaltender,” Bellamy said. “They’ve all been doing well. The national team experience will definitely help us a lot.”
Another interesting feature of this year’s team is its roster size. Having only 18 players means more ice time for everyone. The small numbers have also made the team tight-knit and cohesive.
“I think we are a very close team with a lot of chemistry,” freshman forward Sami Reber said. “We have a lot of talent this year, and I think that will take us far.
With the combination of how close we are as a team and the talent that we have, it should be great season.”
Harvard will need this cohesion to get through one of the toughest schedules in the country.
It will face No. 3 Cornell twice in its conference slate and will face No. 2 Minnesota in a pair of Thanksgiving skates in Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson also has three more opponents from the top 10 on its schedule.
“As far as I know, I think Cornell is always a big competitor in our league, and Dartmouth as well should be a big game,” Reber said. “Overall, we’re going to take everything one game at a time and see where it takes us. Our main goal is to win a national championship, but right now, we’re just focusing on one game at a time.”
But for some upperclassmen, playing the two-time defending ECAC champions means more than simply beating a league competitor.
“Cornell is the team we have in our crosshairs,” Hayssen said. “Every day we’re working hard, we’re working to beat Cornell, of course along with everyone else.”
But the team’s aspirations don’t end with Cornell, as the captain, the veterans, and even the freshmen hope to compete on a national level this season.
“I’d say [winning a national championship] is a goal for us,” Picard said. “It’s not impossible if we can do the little things right and come together as a team.”
“We compete hard, we battle hard,” Baumgartner added. “We’re here to outwork, outhustle, outplay every other team and so whether we’re on the road or whether we’re at home, it doesn’t really matter, we stick to our game plan. So in practices, we’re just focusing on the simple things, the little things, and that’s what’s going to get us through.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard doesn’t often send many athletes into professional sports. But the freshmen of the Crimson men’s hockey team are on their way to bucking that trend.
Of the nine freshman listed on the Harvard roster, five have already been drafted by NHL teams—four in June’s 2011 amateur draft, and one in 2010.
With one of the strongest recruiting classes in recent memory coupled with key losses from the class of 2010, the Crimson may rely heavily on its group of rookies.
It was a transition two years in the making. Harvard began recruiting this year’s batch of freshmen when they were juniors in high school, but the Crimson could not have anticipated the success that it would have in bringing talent to Cambridge. Harvard is just one of three college teams to bring in four 2011 NHL draftees in its freshman class this year.
“I think we’re excited because we brought in some very good prospects,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I guess we have as many people drafted by the National Hockey League as any team in college hockey … The other side of that is, I once heard that ‘prospect’ just means you haven’t done anything yet, so I think that it’ll be a challenge getting everyone on the same page.”
Since day one, the corps of talented freshmen have worked off of each other—both on and off the rink.
Of the drafted freshmen, defenseman Patrick McNally went earlier in the draft than any other pick, with the Vancouver Canucks selecting the Milton Academy graduate in the fourth round of the 2010 draft. He scored 14 goals and registered 21 assists in just 28 games during his senior season in 2009-2010.
“I was just really comfortable with the coaching staff, and Harvard is obviously the best school in the world, so it was kind of an easy decision,” McNally said of his choice to come to Cambridge. “It’s been good so far, the guys are great with bringing us along, and it’s been fun.”
In the 2011 amateur draft, two Harvard prospects—right wing Petr Placek and goaltender Stephen Michalek—were selected in the sixth round while two more were taken in the seventh.
With the loss of Kyle Richter ’11 and Ryan Carroll ’11 in goal, Michalek will likely see action in the net, splitting time with sophomore Raphael Girard.
“We feel [Michalek] has a chance to be a very, very high-end goalie,” Donato said. “[But] there will be some growing pains, just like there always are.”
The other two 2011 draftees on the Harvard roster both went in the seventh and final round. Center Colin Blackwell was the 194th overall pick by the San Jose Sharks, and defenseman Max Everson—brother of junior forward Marshall Everson—was taken nine picks later by the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Much like junior Danny Biega, the younger Everson has demonstrated offensive prowess even as a defenseman. As a high school senior, he had 21 points in 22 games.
“Max and [McNally] are great. Both of them, I think, are ready to play right away,” Placek said. “They’re going to be a big help for the team … I’m sure as we keep on going into the season, [the freshmen] are going to have a bigger and bigger impact.”
But their newly-developed chemistry extends beyond ice. All of the rookies talked about the importance of their camaraderie away from Bright Hockey Center, and how that has greatly impacted their college experiences so far.
“I’ve played against a couple of them [before college], but I didn’t really know anyone that well,” McNally said of meeting his classmates on the team. “We basically met for the first time [on the] first day. We all met up at [the] John Harvard statue and from there just became really good friends.”
His freshman teammates agreed, pointing out just how close the group has become in the few months since the start of the year.
“We eat a lot of meals together and hang out a lot,” Max Everson said. “It’s really nice. It’s good to have a group of guys I can get along with and hang out. Obviously, they play hockey with me, so they have the same schedule type.”
“We’re together all the time. I was actually really surprised—all the guys are great,” Placek agreed. “We hang out a lot; there’s not fighting or whatever. There’s really good chemistry between us.”
The impact from the class of 2015 won’t be limited to the drafted prospects. Forward Ryan McGregor, who played twice in the World Junior Championship with Team Switzerland, could become an important member of the offense after he returns from injury. Others, including forward Tommy O’Regan, have already played a role, registering two assists in last week’s exhibition against Western Ontario.
The Crimson has recruited the talent. Now, as Donato recognizes, comes the real challenge.
“We feel like we have a pretty well-rounded class, a pretty international class,” he said. “We’re excited about the class and we feel that now is when the real work begins. We get to work with them, develop them, and hopefully they’ll be great players in the future of Harvard hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a weak offensive performance for much of the 2010-2011 campaign, the front line of the Harvard men’s ice hockey team knew it had to make big changes.
There were certainly improvements in the offseason regimen. For the first time in its history, the team had access to Bright Hockey Center over the summer, allowing skaters to improve over the break. But questions remain, as the team must fill the void left by the loss of some of its top offensive weapons.
If the first period and a half of last Friday’s exhibition game against the University of Western Ontario serves as any indication, the offense will have no trouble getting going.
While the Mustangs didn’t manage a win on its four-game NCAA exhibition tour, none of its opponents matched the Crimson’s seven goals, including five in the first 26 minutes en route to a comfortable 7-4 victory.
Junior forward Conor Morrison, who was born in the opponent’s hometown of London, Ontario, punished his childhood neighbors, leading the team with four points. Assistant captain and forward Alex Killorn also had a big day, tallying an additional two goals and an assist.
Harvard also dominated the power play, scoring four times with a man advantage, including twice in the third period to put the game away.
Though the game was just an exhibition, the Crimson looks more like it did in last year’s second half of the season than in its first, when it consistently struggled on the offensive end.
While Harvard averaged 2.3 goals per game last season, it did almost a full goal better over its last 21 contests, averaging 3.2 per game. Its 32.7 power-play percentage during this span was a drastic improvement on its season average of 19.4 percent.
The team attributed this success to a change in mentality going into the season’s final stretch.
“I think towards the end of the year, we stopped trying to look so much for the pretty play and tried to get players and pucks to the net,” said captain and defenseman Ryan Grimshaw. “We are looking to establish that right now and get it started from the get-go.”
As a result of the Crimson’s late-blooming offensive firepower, Harvard didn’t lose in its final seven regular season games. After an upset in the opening round of the ECAC playoffs, the surprising contenders finally bowed out to Dartmouth in the second series of the tournament. In the best-of-three playoff, the Big Green needed all three games, barely skating by Harvard with a 4-3 victory in the final contest.
But if the Crimson wants to remain competitive this year, it will have to fill some sizeable holes. Harvard graduated four senior forwards last May, including Michael Biega ’11, who scored 11 goals and had 16 assists last season. Both marks were second-best on the team.
Junior forward Alex Fallstrom, who missed much of the beginning of last season due to injury, should provide some of the necessary spark.
“I think for him to be in the lineup is huge because he can protect the puck so well and be such a dominant player,” Killorn said.
According to Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91, a host of players have the potential to step up and fill the seniors’ void.
“[There is a] second wave of guys that has been good but hasn’t really met its full potential just yet,” Donato said. “That list of guys includes Marshall Everson, Alexander Fallstrom, and Conor Morrison. I think those guys are very good players, and we expect them to have breakout years.”
Defensemen have also been a source of offense in the past. Junior Danny Biega, the younger brother of Michael Biega ’11, was the team’s leading scorer last season with 30 points. The defenseman may need to play an even greater role, as he will have to account for the hole left by Chris Huxley ’11, one of the top point-scorers last season.
Perhaps the biggest question mark for the Harvard attack lies with its five incoming freshman forwards, many of whom are expected to contribute immediately.
Among the talented players are Mike Seward, who was named The Boston Globe All-Scholastic Athlete of the Year, and Colin Blackwell, dubbed ESPN Boston’s Mr. Hockey Player of the Year. In addition, both Blackwell and fellow freshman forward Petr Placek were selected in the 2011 NHL draft.
For the Crimson, there are many potential sources of offense. But Harvard will have to get going early in the year, something that has been a struggle over the past several seasons.
In the past three years, the Crimson has a 5-18-4 record in the month of November. Last year, it only registered 16 goals in nine games played.
“I think, any year, there are people you can point to that are big losses,” Donato said. “But to me, I feel like we have an upgrade of talent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Danny Biega was a senior at Salisbury High School in Connecticut three years ago, he decided to break the rules.
He wasn’t allowed to have cable in his dorm room, but there was something he really wanted to watch—his brothers.
So one of his friends snuck in a television, and in study hall, Danny watched Harvard’s opening round game of the 2009 Beanpot against Boston University. Michael Biega ’11, then a sophomore forward, scored the Crimson’s first goal. Alex Biega ’10, then a junior defenseman, tied the game at the final horn—only to have the shot overruled because it came a second too late.
The following year, Danny joined Michael and Alex in Cambridge. Playing together was nothing new to the Biegas; doing so merely continued a tradition that went back to their childhoods in Montreal, where the trio and their youngest brother Marc—now 17, and also quite the hockey player—spent their youth skating on a rink their father built by himself.
The rink had a tree in the middle—good for both checking people into and knocking pucks off of—but as the boys grew older, they eventually outgrew the family yard and moved to a lake next to the Biega home.
“[Montreal] was a great city to grow up in,” Biega recalled. “It’s really hockey-oriented; we basically grew up in skates there. Especially at a young age, it’s what most of your friends do ... So I just naturally followed.”
Though their father never played and there was no history of hockey in the Biega family, the trio of brothers fell in love with the sport.
They would compete and hone their skills through the frigid winters—with games only ending because of fights—before all three attended Salisbury.
“[Being the younger brother] made things easier,” Biega said. “I followed their training programs, and they made me a better player just because of the competitive spirit we had between each other.”
At Salisbury, Danny designed an ambitious plan for himself that included extra classes and summer school so he could skip ahead a year and play with Alex and Michael at Harvard. That he did in 2009-10, when the threesome shared a power-play shift and became just the second trio of brothers to ever suit up for the Crimson at the same time.
“Obviously you don’t get to [play with your siblings] very often,” Biega said. “It was a really unique experience and I really cherished it. That’s something I’m going to remember for the rest of my life.”
Danny finished with nine points on five goals, a solid freshman season. But with Alex captaining the team and Michael finishing second in points, the rookie was overshadowed by his two older brothers.
In 2010, though, with Alex graduating to the NHL’s Buffalo Sabres—who drafted him in the fifth round in 2006—and Michael in his senior campaign, it was Danny who became Harvard’s star.
Despite being a defenseman, and thus not involved in the squad’s offense at all times, Danny led the team with 19 assists and 30 points—the most of any Crimson blueliner in 17 years—and tied with Michael for second on the squad with 11 goals. He was one of just three defensemen in the nation to lead his team in scoring and the first to do so for Harvard since Mark Fusco in 1982.
The awards poured in for the sophomore: first-team All-Ivy League, second-team All-ECAC, the John Tudor Memorial Cup as Harvard’s MVP, and the Inside College Hockey National Player of the Week for Feb. 21.
“[Danny] was outstanding,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “He was able to create a lot of offense and put some numbers up, and it wasn’t at the risk of being weaker defensively. That’s the sign of a very good player.”
Biega’s play improved as the season went on, as the defenseman registered a goal and two assists in the Crimson’s playoff sweep over Clarkson.
That performance came two weeks after he scored goals in four straight games—including a game-winner at Cornell and the first score in Harvard’s upset Beanpot consolation win over No. 15 BU—helping spark a streak in which the Crimson won eight of nine contests.
“It really has a positive effect up and down the lineup if you can get the defense involved in the offense,” Donato said. “It’s very difficult to gameplan to stop a defenseman offensively, so I think [Danny] gives us a little bit of an x-factor ... I’m excited to see how he follows up a great sophomore year.”
Though his team struggled for most of the season, Biega shined, setting the bar even higher for the defenseman in 2011-2012.
“I’m just going to go game-by-game and focus on doing my job out there, manning the puck and playing strong defense,” Biega said.
The junior’s NHL rights are owned by the Carolina Hurricanes, who drafted him in the third round (67th overall) in 2010. With Alex making his way through the Sabres minor league system and Michael working in finance in Boston, the third Biega brother says he hopes to play in the pros one day.
“That’s my dream, that’s my aspiration,” the defenseman said. “I’m going to do everything in my power to accomplish that goal.”
Who knows—maybe one day, then, it will be Alex and Michael doing whatever they can to catch a glimpse of Danny on television.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team started off last season in a rut, dropping 15 of its first 18 contests. But something clicked in February, and the Crimson finished the year on a tear en route to a 12-21-1 (7-14-1 ECAC) record.
“Overall, our record last year was not where we wanted it to be,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.  “But I think at the end of the year … we pulled it together and really finished very strongly and had a good showing at the playoffs.”
Even after the Crimson’s momentum carried the team to a strong—and surprising—finish, the team still feels it can learn from last year’s early woes.
In a schedule that pairs the Crimson with ECAC foes from the first game of the season, there is little margin of error.
“If we just work hard and get our power play going right off the beginning, we’ll see much more success,” senior forward Alex Killorn said.
The team looks to benefit from a strong freshman class, highlighted by five NHL draft picks.
This year’s new crop should bolster the team in a number of dimensions, as it features a good balance of forwards and defensemen and a strong goaltender.
Even before the start of the year, the freshmen have already made an impact, tallying four assists in Harvard’s 7-4 win over Western Ontario in an exhibition.
The Crimson begins its regular season next week with a series of home games, kicking the year off on Nov. 4 against Princeton, a team coming off a solid 17-win campaign. The next day, the team takes on Quinnipiac, a squad that had a middling finish in the ECAC standings a year ago.
In addition to pulling its game together in the season’s early contests, the team will also focus on playing as a cohesive group.
Despite some concerns, Donato remains confident that his team can buck recent historical trends.
“We feel that we have some guys that have some talent and have some ability to make plays in pressure situations that will be beneficial for us immediately,” Donato said.
The team will have to come together quickly to prepare for a perennially anticipated contest, a game at home against rival Cornell on Nov. 11.
After travelling to Princeton on Dec. 10, the team takes a long break for finals and Christmas, not seeing action again until Dec. 30.
And heading into the new year, Harvard will face one of its toughest stretches of the season. On Jan. 6, the Crimson hosts Union, which finished atop the ECAC standings during last year’s regular season.
The Dutchmen may prove to remain a tough opponent, as their top offensive players—senior forward Kelly Zajac, junior forward Jeremy Welsh, and sophomore forward Daniel Carr—are all returning for another season.
The following day, Boston University, ranked in the preseason top 15, travels to Bright Hockey Center to face Harvard.
The Crimson hosts an Ivy League showdown a few weeks later, as Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth come to town at the end of January.
Coming off a season in which they were briefly ranked No. 1 in the nation, the Bulldogs return without some of its offensive leaders, including forwards Denny Kearney and Broc Little.
But junior forward Brian O’Neill—its top goal scorer—and sophomore forward Andrew Miller, are both back, and Yale remains a top ECAC contender yet again.
Like the Bulldogs, Harvard has a pool of talented players in the class of 2011. Seven icemen graduated, including both goaltenders that received significant playing time last year and two of the team’s top scorers.
“Losing two of the senior goalies … is tough,” Donato said.  “We don’t have the experience that we’ve had, but we feel like ultimately [the talent we’ve acquired] … will be a strength for us over the course of time.”
The rest of the team remains optimistic as well.
“We lost some key guys, but I think our core group is still here,” Killorn said.  “I think we’re going to build off of what we did last season.”
The Crimson kicks off what are always the biggest non-league games of the year on Feb. 6 at the Beanpot.
The squad faces off against Boston University in the tournament’s first round.
Harvard will be looking  to end a 19-year drought, the longest in school history.
As the season draws to a close, Harvard meets the Bulldogs and the Bears once again on the road before concluding the season against Clarkson and St. Lawrence on Feb. 24 and 25.
But instead of cruising through these final games while struggling at the season’s start—like the team did last year—the Crimson believes it has the tools to become a constant threat in the league.
“We’re most excited to see how this team does,” captain Ryan Grimshaw said. “We’re excited to see how we mesh together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two games, two wins. That’s all that separates the Harvard women’s soccer team from a guaranteed first-place finish in the Ivy League and a chance to compete in the NCAA tournament for the third time in four years.
The Crimson (10-4-1, 4-0-1 Ivy) faces the first of these two tests on Saturday afternoon against league rival Dartmouth (3-11-0, 1-4-0 Ivy) in Harvard’s final home game this year—and the last for its senior class.
For the Harvard class of 2012, a win on Saturday coupled with a Penn tie or loss would guarantee a third Ivy League championship since suiting up for the Crimson as freshmen in 2008.
But the team is first focused on the Big Green, hoping to continue its four-game win streak.
“It’s just about playing good soccer,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “That’s all we can focus on, keeping possession and trying to play the way we want to play.”
Harvard is coming into Saturday’s matchup having won or tied its last eight games, including a 2-1 triumph over Princeton last Saturday.
Dartmouth, on the other hand, is riding a four-game losing streak, coming off a heartbreaker to Columbia in which the squad gave up two goals in the final seven minutes en route to a 2-1 loss.
Despite its record, the Big Green has had some close matches, including a 2-0 defeat to then-16th ranked Boston University, holding the Terriers scoreless for 80 minutes. The Crimson players acknowledge that despite Dartmouth’s poor record, the team cannot be taken lightly.
“They are very good. They played BU, who is one of the best teams in country, neck-and-neck,” Leone said. “They’re always a tough opponent. It’s going to be an excellent game.”
Dartmouth’s offense has struggled this year, netting only seven goals so far, including three from freshman Tasha Wilkins’ three.
Defensively, the Big Green has been solid, allowing 1.64 goals per game, but in the defensively-oriented Ivies, that still is not in the top half of the league.
Dartmouth co-captain Erin Fleischli anchors the Dartmouth back line, while Tatiana Saunders and Colleen Hogan have split time in net.
Harvard co-captain Melanie Baskind, with seven goals and a league-leading eight assists, will lead the attack in Saturday’s game. Freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby and sophomore Elizabeth Weisman are also threats to score, with five and four goals, respectively.
“It’s really going to be about each team trying to establish what they want to do,” Leone said. “And our thing is obviously keeping the ball and attacking from that standpoint.”
Passions will run high on senior day, and the match is bound to be a tightly contested one.
“Dartmouth is a very talented team,” junior Aisha Price said. “They’re a physical team, and they play with a lot of fight, so I think in this game coming up on Saturday, we have to match their intensity and really come out of the gate ready to play a hard game.”
The Crimson leads the Ivy League with 13 points in the standings with two games remaining, followed by Penn with 12.
The Quakers face a challenge of their own this weekend against third-place Brown.
Before the game, there will be a senior day ceremony honoring Baskind, Lindsey Kowal, Sophie Legros, Rebecca Millock, Hana Taiji, and Patricia Yau as they play their last game in front of a home crowd.
These six seniors have accomplished a great deal for the Crimson, earning two berths into the NCAA tournament in 2008 and 2009. But they have also been a shining presence off the field as well.
“They are wonderful young women,” Leone said. “They’ve given so much to the program. They’ve obviously had a great amount of success on the field, but off the field they’ve done a lot for Harvard, and academically they’re so strong. They’re just remarkable, resilient, young woman.”
“They’ve been great leaders throughout the entire season,” Price added. “I think all the underclassmen look up to the seniors, and this kind of one game where we can play hard and for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all have to make tough choices sometimes. This college or that one. Finance or consulting. Homework or television. Soup or salad.
But at the end of the day, we have to make a decision. What’s it going to be once and for all—chicken Caesar or tomato bisque?
That’s where Harvard finds itself. Having choices is better than not having them, though it certainly complicates things.
The Crimson doesn’t just have two talented quarterbacks—it probably has the best and the second-best passers in the Ivy League. And to be honest, I’m not sure which is which.
Junior Colton Chapple started four times for Harvard, but his two most recent games are the ones worth mentioning. In those contests against Cornell and Bucknell, he threw a total of nine touchdowns, the best two-game performance in team history.
Like most rational Harvard fans, I assumed that the man responsible for 63 points in just about six quarters would start the game against Princeton. And of course, I was wrong.
Instead, senior Collier Winters got the start, and he one-upped his teammate with six touchdowns, five in the air and one on a scramble. In the post-game press conference, Crimson coach Tim Murphy said that Winters was the starter for the rest of the year, and he said it without any reservation.
Should we believe Murphy? I’m not sure. After a season of unsuccessfully trying to predict his next move, I’m thinking about going with tarot cards, though I’m open to basically any kind of divination at this point.
We’ll assume for the sake of argument that Winters is starting tomorrow’s night game against Dartmouth. But I wouldn’t bet the rent on that one.
Whichever quarterback plays will face a tough but inconsistent Dartmouth defense on Saturday night. The 6 p.m. start marks the first time in program history that the Crimson has hosted two night games in the same season.
This probably won’t be the best game of the week, even if the Big Green is much better than its lackluster record indicates. That distinction belongs to the Penn-Brown matchup.
After a fourth-quarter scoring barrage against Yale gave Penn yet another comeback win last Saturday, the Quakers face a tough opponent for the second week in a row.
Brown has an outside shot at the league title, and the team is certainly talented and capable of taking down the preseason favorites. It will be Penn’s biggest test before it comes to Cambridge in two weeks.
YALE (3-3, 2-1 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (0-6, 0-3)
For seven of its last eight quarters of football against Ivy League opponents, Yale has looked really impressive.
As it so happens, one bad quarter was one too many. Against Penn, the Bulldogs squandered a 10-point lead in the fourth and then gave up a bunch more for good measure, losing to the Quakers, 37-25.
The loss puts a big dent in Yale’s Ivy League title hopes. But by no means is the team out yet—it just needs to win every game for the rest of the year and count on some losses from Penn and Harvard. And that can certainly happen.
Though the Bulldogs need to win every game they play, that does not mean they need to worry about every one of them. Against Columbia, there’s no reason Yale should work up an elevated blood pressure.
The Lions have struggled all season, losing in a convincing shutout to a Dartmouth team that has had issues of its own.
Death and taxes may be the only certainties in this world, but another sloppy Columbia performance isn’t far off.
Prediction: Yale 30, Columbia 13
PENN (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) at BROWN (5-1, 2-1)
I think Harvard is really lucky that it played and beat Brown so early in the season. The more I watch Bears football, the more impressed I am.
Yes, Brown’s last two wins have come against Princeton and Cornell, but that doesn’t detract from how well the team is playing. The Bears are clearly talented, and a win over Holy Cross proves that. Kyle Newhall-Caballero is one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and he can be a threat on any given week.
At this point in the season, no one is surprised to see Penn sitting on a 3-0 Ivy record. What is so shocking about these three wins for the preseason favorites is how it got them.
It doesn’t seem to matter who the Quakers are playing. In all three league games, Penn has been just good enough.
It started with a last-second, come-from-behind win at Dartmouth. It continued against lowly Columbia, when the Quakers needed a last-minute touchdown to avoid overtime with the winless Lions.
And last week against Yale at home, it happened again. Penn was down by 10 going into the fourth before an explosive quarter opened up the game. The Quakers won, 37-25, but the game was much closer than the score indicated.
Despite its league record, Penn is a weakened team, and it has fallen well outside the FCS Top 25. You could say that the Quakers have gotten lucky with their close wins, but when you’re that lucky, you’re probably just good.
But you can’t keep counting on wins like the ones Penn has had. It will eventually catch up to you.
Prediction: Brown 28, Penn 26
CORNELL (2-4, 0-3 Ivy) at PRINCETON (1-5, 1-2)
Princeton is by no means the best team in the Ivies, but Harvard witnessed last week that the team can still be explosive. The Tigers rallied from a 26-point deficit to pull within three.
Harvard pulled away in the end, but it became clear that, at any given moment, Princeton might be able to turn its offense—and its season—around.
Cornell’s offense has a major upside as well. If Winters and Chapple aren’t the one-two in the Ivy League quarterback rankings, it’s probably because of Big Red sophomore Jeff Mathews. And with two years left, he’s only going to get better.
To some extent, I think Princeton’s third quarter last week was a fluke. The team certainly has offensive firepower, but not that much. Though Cornell hasn’t picked up a win in the Ancient Eight yet, almost all of its games have been tight. Advantage Cornell in the matchup of off-and-on offenses.
Prediction: Cornell 31, Princeton 21
DARTMOUTH (2-4, 1-2 Ivy) at HARVARD (5-1, 3-0)
As good as its offense has been all year, the Crimson’s defense has been a little bit like an old car—it always seems to get you there, but the ride is sometimes a little shaky.
Granted, seniors Josue Ortiz and Matt Hanson missed part of the game last week, which certainly hurt. But the 30 points that Princeton put up in under 15 minutes still demonstrates some vulnerability.
Here’s a week-by-week rundown of the number of points the Crimson has surrendered this year, starting from the first game: 30, 7, 3, 31, 3, 39.
So which defense will show up in tomorrow night’s game? It remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, Dartmouth has consistency issues of its own. Yale shut out the Big Green earlier this year, but Dartmouth scored 37 in its shakedown of Columbia.
If Harvard’s quarterbacks keep playing like they’ve been doing all year, it won’t matter which Big Green team takes the field.
Prediction: Harvard 38, Dartmouth 24
RECORD LAST WEEK: 4-0 (To date: 16-6)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard football team kicks off against Dartmouth tomorrow night at 6 p.m., both teams will be making minor history. It’s the first time that the Crimson has ever played two night games at Harvard Stadium in the same season, and it is the Big Green’s second game ever under the lights.
But few beyond the most fanatical football history buffs know the historical significance of tomorrow’s game.
Ninety years ago to the day, playing at the same stadium, Harvard hosted Centre College, a small school from Danville, Ky.
Coming into that 1921 matchup, Harvard hadn’t lost a game since 1916, excluding exhibitions during World War I that generally aren’t counted as official. The Crimson was just about two years removed from its first and only Rose Bowl win in 1920, and the team was still at the top of the football world.
A week before that game, Harvard tied Penn State, 21-21. Despite signs that the Crimson might not be as strong as it had been a year prior, no one in Boston gave the tiny school in Kentucky a chance.
But against all odds, in front of more than 40,000 fans at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson lost, 6-0.
It was an embarrassing loss for Harvard. Alumni and fans alike expressed both shock and frustration in the defeat at the hands of the Centre Praying Colonels.
“Centre College triumphed because they outrushed, outpassed, and out-maneuvered their Crimson opponents,” said R. B. Wigglesworth, class of 1912 and member of the football advisory committee, to The Harvard Crimson the Monday after the game. “If victory is to be achieved over Princeton and Yale the team must demonstrate on the field a complete reversal of form.”
The Crimson’s sub-headline captures the school’s sentiments on the game: “Raging Kentuckians Humble University Team by 6 to 0 Before Packed Stadium Crowd.”
Bo McMillin, Centre’s quarterback and a consensus All-American, scored the team’s lone touchdown, and he became an icon in the state of Kentucky for it.
“I’d rather be Bo McMillin at this moment than the governor of Kentucky,” Edwin Morrow, the governor of Kentucky, said after the game.
The 1921 Harvard-Centre game is remembered as one of the all-time major upsets in the history of college football, and the Associated Press called it the greatest upset in all of sports in the first half of the 20th century.
Even today, it is still considered one of the most shocking victories in the game’s history, on the same level as Appalachian State’s stunning 2007 win over Michigan.
“Centre admired the boys from Harvard … but they also wanted to beat them so they could enter into the level that Harvard was playing,” said Robert Robertson, a Centre graduate and author of a book on the Centre football team in the early 1920s. “During that era, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale were the powers. They were the Big Three. From the conception of the game in 1869 until the early ’20s, the big powers were in the East.”
CENTRE FOOTBALL
Though Centre’s win over Harvard on Oct. 29, 1921 stunned the University and sent ripples through the college football world, it may not have been the great upset that everyone assumes it is.
Though it was a small school with hardly any history of football prowess, the team developed into a national power almost overnight.
“It was a very unique situation in that they burst upon the scene out of nowhere to become a major school, and then just that quickly disappeared,” said Kent Stephens, museum curator and historian at the College Football Hall of Fame. “If you look at the best teams in the nation in, say, 1919, Centre would probably be in the top five. So the upset against Harvard in 1921 … is not nearly as extreme as you think it would be.”
Centre College stumbled onto gridiron success as much as it created it. It’s a story that begins with Robert Myers, known better as “Chief.”
Myers, a Centre graduate, was a high school football coach in Texas, a job he landed without much prior experience in the game. After a few years at the helm at the Dallas school, the coaching job at his alma mater opened up, and, despite a lack of any experience at the college level, he was offered the job.
When he left Texas, he brought some of his graduating seniors along with him. One of those seniors was McMillin—the hero of the Harvard-Centre game.
But Myers quickly realized that he was not qualified for the job, so he hired Charley Moran, a Major League Baseball umpire, and promoted himself to a position something like an athletic director today.
Even after the switch, Myers remained the visionary behind Centre’s program.
“[Myers] comes to Moran, and he says, ‘I’ve got this great plan: first we’re going to be the best team in Kentucky, then we’re going to become the best team in the South, and then we’re going to be a national power,’” Stephens explained. “And they pull it off.”
The Praying Colonels quickly rose to power late in the 1910s, and by 1920, the team had a game with Harvard on its schedule.
'C6H0'
Coming off a 7-6 win over Oregon at the Rose Bowl, Harvard was slated to face Virginia, Princeton, Yale, and other tough opponents during its 1920 campaign.
Its first game against Centre was not expected to be much of a contest. On Oct. 23, 1920, Harvard beat Centre—spelled “Center” in programs—handily, 31-14. The game was tied going into the half, but the Crimson had little difficulty coming away with the win.
After the loss, Centre completely shifted the focus of the program.
“Coming into the ’21 game, Centre for an entire year had keyed its whole program to going back and beating Harvard,” Robertson said. “It just became one of those missions for the school and for the boys.”
The Praying Colonels did just that. When Centre came back to Cambridge in 1921, both teams were undefeated.
Though The Harvard Crimson acknowledged that the Colonels were greatly improved from the 1920 team, the newspaper never gave the team a real shot.
“The southerners enter the struggle today with odds, as far as actual victory is concerned, against them,” The Crimson wrote in a preview of the Harvard-Centre game. “Centre undoubtedly has a stronger combination than that which faced the Crimson last fall. This fact, however, does not necessarily imply that the southerners have as powerful a team as the Penn Staters.”
Once again, the two teams went into halftime tied, 0-0. But this time, the Centre defense continued to stifle Harvard’s offensive efforts, and a touchdown from McMillin was all the offense the Praying Colonels needed.
For Centre, it was—and probably still is—the biggest win in the history of the program.
“It put Centre on the map. Of course, Harvard was already on the map, but it put Centre on the map,” Robertson said. “It was a very defining period for Centre, to be able to be at least associated in the same sentence with Harvard.”
All around the tiny town of Danville, people celebrated with what became an iconic set of four symbols: C6H0. Centre 6, Harvard 0.
The signs popped up all around the town, and, even 90 years later, a few of the original markings still exist.
“[C6H0] was anyplace you could reach with a paint bucket and a brush,” Robertson said. “It was on the front of the main administrative building … Every building, every store window, [and] many of the houses had C6H0 written on them.”
Both schools had a few more seasons as national contenders, but the game came at the tail end of dominance for the Ivy League and for Centre.
“I think it wasn’t so much that the Big Three [of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton] got worse. It was just that everybody else just caught up to them and got so much better,” Stephens said. “The quality of play at the Big Three probably stayed the same, but the quality of play everywhere else improved.”
Harvard and Centre faced each other one more time in 1922, a 24-10 Harvard victory. The two haven’t met in the 89 years since.
A REMATCH?
According to Centre’s athletic website, the school has offered the Crimson rematches on a number of occasions, including as recently as the 75th anniversary of the game.
But Harvard has declined every one of the invitations from Centre, now a Division III athletic program.
According to Robertson, the two were engaged in serious talks of a rematch at the 50th anniversary of the game, with both sides expressed interest. Logistically, it didn’t work out, and the potential Harvard-Centre matchup was dropped.
These days, the Crimson rarely plays teams outside of the Ivy or Patriot Leagues. There are exceptions—for the first time, the team plays the University of San Diego of the Pioneer Football League next year—but these matchups are uncommon.
Alumni with a connection to a game, like Robertson, remain hopeful that the two teams could meet again in 2021. But with the discrepancy in the caliber of play so great between Division III and the Football Championship Subdivision, the chances of a reprisal between these long-forgotten rivals grow increasingly unlikely.
“If we can occasionally get an Army, Navy, or an academic school like Duke, that would be great,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “But [to play Centre] wouldn’t make a lot of sense. … Nothing to gain and everything to lose.”
