After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Right now I am logged into Facebook and just finished watching a Youtube video that was Tweeted to me by a Friend.  How about you?
If you're anything like me, and millions of other Americans, you’ve probably been here before. It’s evident why social media are so popular from the user side, but they have also created a boon for businesses as well. Firms have caught onto the fact that adding an aspect of community to their websites can create a viral growth effect on their popularity. The poster child of such a scheme, Facebook, boasts 500 million active users, and countless other websites follow behind with millions of active users. Clearly, both users and businesses are excited about how the various forms of social media are the “big new thing” right now, as the endless list of websites riding on Facebook’s coattails suggest—maybe a bit too excitedly.
The surplus of excitement is causing these websites to be worth a lot more than they should, and the current valuations are shocking. The micro-blogging service Twitter was recently valuated at $7.7 billion, which seems ridiculous considering that this is almost 100 times its yearly revenue. Facebook was valued 83 times greater than its yearly revenue, at $50 billion dollars. The overvaluation doesn't stop here: Groupon is valued at ten times more than its yearly revenue, and social-gaming behemoth Zynga is overvalued at 12 times more.
But it isn’t the first time something like this is occurring. In the late 1990s, new Internet-based retail companies were the “big new thing” of the time, and investors starting throwing as much money at them as they could in an attempt to get in on the action. But even though these new websites were popular and convenient for consumers, they actually didn't make as much money as their buyers expected. The addition of the “.com” suffix to company names wasn't enough—the IT bubble burst, and the nation was met with an economic recession when stock prices plummeted.
Fast-forward to 2011, where history is repeating itself.  The social networking bubble is growing. It should be clear that the bubble is poised to break sooner, rather than later, just given the prices of these companies. The Internet allows for essentially free entry to the social networking market, and as soon as a company decides to charge users for its services it loses its valuable user base to competition. This means that the opportunity to monetize these days is becoming harder and harder to do. The best example of this is Twitter, which can't seem to monetize off of its large user base and will probably never be profitable. It seems that making money on the Internet through a free service is becoming increasingly difficult. While some companies do it well, the others that find it unsustainable will eventually contribute to the bursting of this new bubble.
The American economy has seen the ebb and flow of various economic bubbles throughout its history.  The signs of a new bubble are here, and while the first Internet bubble caught many people off guard, we can be prepared this time. The Internet is certainly here to stay, but its use changes dramatically from year to year. Large Internet firms could be worth billions one day and then nothing the next. In these uncertain times, conservative and safe investments are superior to those that try to ride the “big new thing.”  Social media is definitely “it” right now, and they are certainly a successful means of getting people together online to build a community. But it could be soon when replaced by tomorrow’s next big thing. We've seen it with the housing market, and we've seen it with the Internet bubble—when upward trends suddenly stop, assets become much less valuable overnight, and the country dips into a recession. This time, however, we’ve see the signs beforehand, and hopefully we can prepare accordingly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have been at Harvard for almost three years, and, frankly, I don’t see what the fuss is about. Not to say that Harvard isn’t a wonderful school or that it doesn’t provide a quality education; in spite of its best efforts, it is and it does. But nothing justifies the iron stranglehold that Harvard, along with Yale, has on the levers of power in American society—to the exclusion even of comparably esteemed institutions like Princeton and Stanford.
Let’s take stock. Twelve presidents have gone to Harvard or Yale, including the last four. The next commonest alma mater is William and Mary, whose paltry three presidential alumni exceeds Princeton’s two and Stanford’s one.
In the current United States Cabinet, Harvard and Yale graduated six of 22 members, while Princeton and Stanford only produced one apiece. In fact, the highest ranking Princetonian in the executive—EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson—isn’t even a secretary, only a Cabinet-level officer. Her Stanford counterpart—U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice—is similarly lacking secretarial status.
The most patent manifestation of the Harvard-Yale bias, however, is the composition of the current Supreme Court, all nine of whose justices graduated from Harvard or Yale or both.
What distinguishes Harvard and Yale from Princeton and Stanford so dramatically as to legitimize this massive disparity? Princeton and Stanford are both younger than Harvard and Yale, so perhaps in the early days of the Republic, the ascendancy of the latter two was appropriate. But that hardly justifies the persisting preeminence of the Cambridge-New Haven axis into the modern day, whereas erstwhile rival William and Mary has long since abdicated its relevance. Superior academics is similarly unsatisfactory as an explanation. Princeton and Stanford’s undergraduate programs are consistently ranked alongside Harvard and Yale’s, and Stanford’s graduate programs perform likewise.
As tempting as it may be for us Harvardians to defend the Harvard-Yale duopoly as the inevitable culmination of American meritocracy, the evidence demonstrates otherwise. As trite as the derision of George W. Bush’s purported intellectual deficiency is and has always been, even his apologists could scarcely argue that his impeccable Ivy League credentials proved that he was a man of exceptional academic prowess.
Furthermore, the domination of the two schools is, at the presidential level, largely recent. While the last four commanders-in-chief passed through Cambridge and New Haven, there were only four others that did in the 20th century and only four in the 19th. The stacking of the High Court exclusively with Harvard and Yale graduates, likewise, is a trend, not a tradition. It was only the recent departure of Chicago and Northwestern Law grad John Paul Stevens that ended the presence of a non-Harvard or Yale perspective on the bench.
Now, this is not to say that we ought to emulate Bush’s unfortunate habit of elevating mediocrity by enlisting 150 graduates of Pat Robertson’s fourth-tier Regent University into the executive branch. None but the rankest populists would argue that the way to fix a compromised meritocracy is to abolish meritocracy altogether. But there is unmistakable peril in allowing such an incestuous method of selecting the nation’s leaders to persist.
The name of that peril is groupthink. In 1972, David L. Halberstam ’55 famously refashioned the phrase “the best and the brightest” to encapsulate the irony of how Presidents John F. Kennedy ’40 and Lyndon B. Johnson’s faith in well-credentialed, Ivy League theoreticians like Robert S. McNamara and McGeorge Bundy resulted in the catastrophic mismanagement of the Vietnam War. Today, too, we risk depending too heavily on “the best and brightest,” over-relying now not so much on an inexperienced intellectual elite as an inbred intellectual elite.
The lazy analogy between our time and Halberstam’s is Afghanistan and Vietnam, but this is comparison is imprecise, as the escalation of the former is the brainchild of the military brass, not of academics and intellectuals. The more interesting similarity is between Vietnam and the financial crisis. A salient critique of President Barack H. Obama’s management of the crisis and its aftermath was of his employment of a veritable rogue’s gallery of Rubinite deregulators, namely Harvard’s own Larry H. Summers. Upon his return to Cambridge, Summers was replaced as National Economic Council director by another ex-Clintonista, Yale’s Gene B. Sperling. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner was a protégé of his predecessor, Harvardian Henry M. “Hank” Paulson, who graduated five years before his successor at Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75.
There cannot be much intellectual diversity among America’s leaderly caste when so many of them went to one of two schools. Yes, universities encourage debate and inquiry, but there is something to be said for diversity of perspective. While racially and socioeconomically diverse, Harvard sorely lacks other forms of diversity, including ideological diversity, as the sorry state of Harvard conservatism demonstrates.
In the end, however, the most obviously problematic element of the Harvard-Yale duumvirate is its rank unfairness. With the unabashed inequity of the status quo privileging those who graduate from Harvard and Yale over those who don’t, it is hardly surprising that this kind of clubby exclusivity so rampant in the corridors of power breeds resentment among those on the outside looking in.

If you turn on the radio these days and switch to a Top 40 station, you’ll notice that all the songs sound the same. Well, they do at least in one crucial category: Every pop singer has amazingly perfect pitch. Of course, the trend doesn’t come from a sudden influx of talent but from software. Auto-Tune, created by Antares Audio Technologies, can re-tune a singer’s pitches so that a tenor’s high A sung a quarter-tone flat lands at a perfect 440 Hz.
On the surface, Auto-Tune sounds like trickery, and it is to some extent. But while attempts to stop the use of technology have failed in the past, the industry’s obsession with Auto-Tune will eventually fade, and there are signs that that day is nearly here.
Most people know of Auto-Tune through the work of artists like T-Pain, who exaggerate the effect to achieve a distinct sound, or from comedy clips like “Auto-Tune the News,” which apply the technology to flat speech to give the impression that the person is singing. Fewer realize that the technology also is responsible for the remarkable pitch of nearly every pop record of the last decade and a half, or that live music at concerts is often filtered through software boxes that ensure a pitch-perfect performance.
The original Auto-Tune algorithm was devised in 1996 by the creator of an oil-surveying technique, and it uses a mathematical trick involving autocorrelation functions to correct the pitch of sound waves. Almost immediately, mild doses of Auto-Tune were used to fix mistakes and avoid doing extra takes of songs, but the 1998 Cher song “Believe” became the first major hit to exhibit the characteristic “yodel” effect that occurs when the algorithm is cranked up to full-strength and the retune delay is set close to zero milliseconds.
Auto-Tune unquestionably degrades the art of singing, largely because it makes pitch control a matter of a few mouse clicks rather than a challenge that once took many years to master. Worse, a generation of listeners accustomed to the centered pitches of Auto-Tuned recordings might have trouble enjoying jazz and blues singers, who often slide in and out of notes for effect.
However, to say that AutoTune takes talent out of the equation is an exaggeration. The technology can’t make your little sister’s shower singing sound like Aretha Franklin. An average singer using AutoTune simply sounds like an average singer who has amazingly perfect pitch placement (see Katy Perry’s entire oeuvre).
Auto-Tune may have lowered the bar for pop hits, but it only caps a half-century of movement away from conventional notions of talent and musicianship. Rap already showed that you can have a popular record without any singing at all, just rhythm and a story. Furthermore, aside from rare exceptions like Mariah Carey, pop singers of the past 30 years or so have become famous because of their style and their dance moves, not their dulcet tones, and AutoTune doesn’t make it any more or less true.
It’s hard to imagine that, had Auto-Tune existed in the 1980s, the music of Madonna or Duran Duran would sound much different. If anything, Auto-Tune can be credited with bringing melody and songwriting back to the pop charts. If performers like Ke$ha want to use pitch-correction software to add a simple melody to the chorus of their rap songs, so be it.
In addition, while AutoTune appears ubiquitous in the rarefied world of the Billboard Top 40, it hasn’t had nearly as big of an impact in other genres where musicianship has traditionally been more important, such as jazz. Furthermore, contestants on American Idol regularly serenade viewers without the software, and their pitch problems don’t seem to faze the show’s voters.
After the auto-tuned comedy segment at the Oscars last month, I’m confident that the public is now aware enough about Auto-Tune that it is no longer a sneaky deception but simply a tool at an artist’s disposal. The comments that Auto-Tune blurs the line between reality and artifice could easily be made about digital editing, which allows engineers to create Frankenstein versions of vocal tracks cobbled from multiple different takes or even different singers. Yet no one would write songs about the “death of editing” the way Jay-Z urged other recording artists to stop using Auto-Tune.
As music continues to grow and evolve, obsession with perfect pitch will eventually subside. After all, it is boring to hear song after song where every pitch is perfectly centered. Untalented celebrities will always rely to studio magic to truss up their singles, and engineers may quietly use pitch correction algorithms behind the scenes to avoid doing additional takes. However, a new wave of artists who eschew pitch-correction will soon rise, just as punk emerged as a backlash against over-produced disco hits.
That is, until some new technology emerges that can remove the need for talent altogether.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across the river, the Allston community remains distant from the bristling intellect and verve of Harvard Square. Throughout the 80s and 90s, Harvard bought large tracts of Allston under the names of proxy companies and then announced plans for an expansive campus in the area, centered on a $1 billion Science Complex. However, in 2008, the University halted construction in Allston, after the financial crisis made it impossible to continue building. Today, the Science Complex building site and other Harvard-owned properties remain largely vacated, waiting for new tenants or restarted construction. 
 
In light of growing concerns about Harvard’s level of commitment and the crucial, mission-defining period the capital campaign is in, we are compelled to opine again on the future of Allston. Last week, we advocated that Harvard refocus its capital campaign on resuming construction in North Allston, and we argued in broader, more philosophical terms that a desirable conclusion to what has been a painful episode for Allstonians takes precedence over House Renewal. Now, however, we write to articulate what we would like to see materialize across the river. 
 
Harvard needs nothing short of a defining vision for this project and must retool its approach to developing Allston to actualize the vibrant community it initially vowed to create. 
 
True, Harvard has spearheaded certain valuable community initiatives, such as the Harvard-Allston Education Portal, the Innovation Lab, and a seasonal skating rink. This speaks to some level of dedication to replace the literal and figurative hole in North Allston. Nonetheless, the University’s long-term commitments to its developments in the community need further conceptual development and increased clarity. There may be conflicting goals as to what explicit direction Allston’s redevelopment should take, but Harvard must distill these ideas into a true mission that is both attainable and agreeable to the University community.
 
The Harvard Allston Work Team, made up of the deans of each school in the University system and co-chaired by former Institute of Politics Director Bill Purcell, is due to give University President Drew G. Faust suggestions on Allston development in the middle of this year. We urge that their report be taken very seriously by Faust and others involved with the project. At times, Harvard paid only lip service to the reports and opinions of task forces, such as the Undergraduate Council’s Budget Cuts Task Force and the Committee to Review the Administrative Board. This should not be the case with the Harvard Allston Work Team’s findings, which should be made public to the entire community, so we can better understand the University’s commitment to and plans for Allston. They will, after all, impact the undergraduate community, like they will all facets of the University, in a significant way. 
 
Additionally, Harvard should be consulting the residents themselves even more than they do already. We are no experts on the specific needs of the Allston community, but there are those who are—and, to a certain extent, they have been struggling to make their voices heard. The Harvard Allston Task Force, composed of Allston and Brighton residents, which has been making recommendations on the future of the project, should take a more proactive role in conceptualizing development. The scope of Allston renewal goes beyond that of cutting a budget or introducing a program; people’s lives and livelihoods have been affected in ways infinitely more consequential than many understand, and Harvard would do well to take their input more than lightly. True, the University has indeed said all of these things before, and President Faust has reassured the community that Allston remains a priority. But words mean only so much, and at some point they need to be translated into measureable plans.
 
A most prosperous future for Allston will result from neither a purely academic nor a purely communal vision—Harvard should seek to create a locus of scholarship and service in which the academic and local communities interact and intermix.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Elizabeth F. Weisman ’14 and her blockmates waited nervously yesterday morning, they heard a knock on the door and cheers of “Dunster!” But as she opened the door, a crowd of people in head bands, suit jackets, and boxers welcomed them into Adams.
“It was our first choice,” Weisman said yesterday, wearing her new yellow Adams shirt based on the Sam Adams Beer logo, at lunch in Annenberg.
Yesterday morning, the class of 2014 received their House assignments, and by 8 a.m. a crowd of upperclassmen had gathered around the John Harvard statue to prepare to welcome their newest House members. Upperclassmen dressed in House t-shirts and House mascots—including a bunny, polar bear, penguin, and fish—rallied in the Yard, while freshmen waited for the delivery of the envelopes that contained their Housing assignments.
Hannah C. Donoghue ’14, who lives in Canaday, said she could hear the upperclassmen screaming and running around the Yard this morning.
“It was a little overwhelming,” Donoghue said of receiving her Mather assignment.
For many freshmen, the excitement began last night with the “Fresh Fest” in Annenberg and, for some, an under-the-radar River Run, an unofficial and relatively new tradition in which freshmen take shots in the courtyards of the Houses they want to be in.
Ginny C. Fahs ’14, who was placed in Quincy, said she got two hours of sleep last night after her entire blocking group slept over in her room in Wigglesworth. Fahs, whose first choice was Quincy, said that the first indication she got of her placement was a text from her linkmates, who got into Lowell.
“We were jumping for joy,” she said, showing off her new “Quinception” t-shirt, based on the Quincy housing day parody of the film “Inception.” “We ripped open our letter and took pictures of it.”
The day was exciting for upperclassmen as well as they welcomed their new House members and relived their own Housing Day experiences.
Dressed in the Leverett Bunny suit at lunch, Leverett HoCo social chair Clare E. Miller ’12 said that the reaction of the freshmen was overwhelmingly enthusiastic.
“I’ve had a secret desire to be in the bunny suit since my freshman year,” Miller said.
For others, yesterday was a chance to show off their Houses to freshmen.
“For my Housing Day, we didn’t have a lot of Cabot people,” James E. Hawrot ’12, the Cabot HoCo Co-Chair said. “This year we’re pumping up the energy ... You can tell from my voice that we’ve been pretty loud. It’s been good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Matthew P. Cavedon ’11 wanted to attend a scholarship dinner in the Eliot dining hall, he had to plan ahead. Cavedon, who uses a motorized wheelchair, needed a special ramp installed for the ceremony. For one day that year, the Eliot dining hall was accessible to people with disabilities.
Students with physical disabilities face the daily challenge of navigating Harvard’s Houses, most of which were built long before federal and state governments passed laws requiring buildings to be accessible.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal, 9 out of Harvard’s 12 Houses are not accessible enough for wheelchair-bound students to live in them.
But as Harvard embarks on its long-planned House renewal project, beginning with the renovation of Old Quincy in 2012, administrators say that improving accessibility is a priority in the construction plans.
The College’s 2009 report outlining its vision for House renewal mentions in a footnote the legal requirements that the renovated Houses must meet—five percent of the suites in each House must be accessible—and also addresses the more elusive concept of “visit-ability.” While stating that the College will aim to make every student room accessible enough that a student in a wheelchair could visit it, if not live there, the report acknowledges that this will likely be impossible due to the historical nature of the structures.
To avoid making some difficult renovations, the report states that the College will need to seek exemptions from state laws.
Between the lofty goal of vastly increased visit-ability and the practical concerns which renovating neo-Georgian buildings entail, it is not yet clear exactly what changes will be made to the existing House infrastructure in order to improve the undergraduate experience for students with mobility impairments.
LIFE IN THE YARD
For students with physical disabilities, the housing process begins from the moment they open Harvard’s acceptance letter.
“When you have a disability, you learn to get the ball rolling fairly early on,” Cavedon says.
Students with physical disabilities say that arranging freshman year housing is often the first and most important step in their transition to college. According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, about 20 students per class request accommodations for housing, with a half dozen needing arrangements for some sort of mobility impairment. Students who are blind, deaf, or otherwise disabled account for the rest of the accommodations.
These students typically talk to the FAS Accessible Education Office and work directly with Harvard Yard Operations in the summer before they arrive on campus.
Weld and Thayer are the only two fully accessible freshman dorms, according to Neal, and Greenough, Matthews, and Canaday are partially accessible.
Lauren E. Faraino ’13 lived in a room on the second floor of Thayer last year with a connecting room for her live-in aide. Faraino, who uses a wheelchair and writes with her feet, requires a specialized desk for taking notes in class and completing exams, in addition to an accessible shower and restroom in her suite.
Cavedon, who spent his freshman year in a single on the first floor of Weld, says that the College was willing to make personalized changes to the already-accessible room, including changing the toilet and sink heights, installing an automatic door, and ordering a custom desk that his raised wheelchair could fit under.
“He was perfectly willing to rip open walls,” Cavedon says of Anthony Pacillo, senior manager of Harvard Yard and freshman dormitories. “He made it possible to live independently.”
LIMITED ACCESSIBILITY
After leaving the Yard, students with mobility impairments find themselves constrained by the existing House infrastructure.
Currier, Quincy, and Pforzheimer are the only Houses accessible to students in wheelchairs, according to Neal.
Even these options, students say, are not ideal. Faraino was originally placed in Currier with her blocking group. However, she says, “I realized toward the end of the year there were certain obstacles to living in the Quad that I wouldn’t be able to overcome—obviously distance-related.”
Now, she is affiliated with Quincy House and lives in DeWolfe, though she takes the shuttle to visit her blockmates and linkmates in the Quad almost every day, she said.
Students with disabilities say that Harvard’s many inaccessible dorms make it difficult for them to visit friends and attend social events.
“It’d be great if they could make every single dorm accessible. That way I could visit friends,” Valerie J. Piro ’14 says, noting that in her wheelchair, she cannot access rooms in most Yard dorms, where vertical entryways centered around staircases are the predominant architecture. “I feel guilty asking friends to come here all the time.”
Even everyday socializing can be difficult due to the structure of many Harvard dorms. While Cavedon has lived in a single in New Quincy for the past three years, most Quincy sophomores lived in Old Quincy, a building with vertical entryways.
“I was one of three sophomores in New Quincy. Not being able to visit friends was hard,” Cavedon says of his first year in Quincy. “One of the things I enjoyed in Weld was flitting between rooms.”
For now, Cavedon’s solution to the problem of attending social events in inaccessible Houses is unorthodox: He relies on friends to carry his chair up stairs to parties.
“I haven’t ended up with anything broken yet,” he says. “Is it annoying? Absolutely.”
ACCESSIBILITY AND THE LAW
Both students and administrators say they hope Harvard will create more accessible living spaces as House renewal—the ambitious planned renovation for the undergraduate Houses—moves forward in the coming years. And under the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act and state regulations, improving accessibility must by law be a part of the renovation plans.
State accessibility codes order that buildings be made fully accessible whenever a property owner undertakes renovations of a public building which cost 30 percent or more of the value of the building being updated.
Thomas P. Murphy, chair of the Disability Law Center of Massachusetts, says that if the cost of House renewal tops this cutoff, “they will have to meet the standards of accessibility that would be required as if it were new construction.”
The exact cost of House renewal is not yet known, but Harvard administrators and disability law experts both forecast that Harvard’s renovations will exceed the cap, thus bringing the Houses under the auspices of state codes and the ADA.
According to lawyers, the ADA—which was passed in 1990 after the construction of all 12 Houses—stipulates that a certain percentage of rooms in each House must be accessible, as well as all common spaces, such as dining halls.
The rules have their nuances though. Dingman recalls that in the early 1990s, when Yard dorms were renovated, Harvard decided that it would be nearly impossible to make all of the dormitories—which date back as far as 1720—accessible.
Dingman says the interiors of some dorms, including Thayer, were converted from their previous vertical entryway format into horizontal floors, making them accessible. But to get around the challenge of changing the interior makeup of dorms such as Wigglesworth and Straus, Dingman says that Harvard obtained permission from the city of Cambridge to group the Yard into four quarters and ensure that each zone had accessible rooms, rather than every individual building.
However, Murphy does not believe that treating multiple Houses as one building would be legal today.
“If they’re doing renovation to each of the Houses, then each individual House renovation should meet the standards. Within each one, there should be fully accessible common areas and a disbursement of accessible rooms,” Murphy says.
However, there are other ways to avoid the ADA requirements.
“In some circumstances you can ask for release—for a variance from the requirement,” says Ann M. Sobolewski, an attorney who specializes in real estate law. “Depending on the age of the building and whether or not they have any historic protections—which some of these buildings very well may—you can get some exceptions.”
Murphy agrees, “They have to do it if it’s feasible, and it’s possible, especially with buildings that are very old, that it may not be structurally or architecturally feasible for them to make certain areas accessible.”
However, he says that Harvard would be hard-pressed to make a case that it cannot afford to update its historic buildings.
“The age of a building or the fact that it would be difficult to do isn’t alone a defense for not doing it,” Murphy says. “For a school like Harvard that has the resources that they do, I don’t think the financial argument would carry much weight.”
GOING FORWARD
Irrespective of potential legal exceptions, administrators say that accessibility is a major goal of House renewal.
“Apart from the law, we want to have options as much as possible,” Dingman says.
For current students in wheelchairs, the changes promised by House renewal are welcome, even if House infrastructures may limit the extent of these accommodations.
“I think they’re going to have difficulty making some of the more historic buildings accessible,” Faraino says. “A lot of these places, it’s not as simple as just putting in an elevator.”
The consensus among students is that Harvard should prioritize creating universally accessible common spaces, even if individual rooms may not all be possible to reach.
“I expect most public spaces to be accessible in the near future,” Cavedon says. “I’d be a little stunned if they didn’t, if the law would allow them not to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long and heated planning process, the real estate development non-profit The Community Builders anounced that they will commence in April the construction of a new cluster of low-income housing units that will replace the older Charlesview Apartment complex currently located near Harvard Business School, according to Community Builders Director of Development Felicia Jacques.
The new housing complex will be located a few blocks down Western Avenue on land which is currently occupied by several vacant buildings in the Brighton Mills shopping center. The housing complex will consist of 26 townhouses and a few apartment towers, Allston resident and community activist Tim McHale said.
The new location—formerly owned by Harvard—was officially given to Charlesview in 2009 in exchange for University ownership of the lot on which the current housing complex stands, in an effort to consolidate Harvard’s Allston land holdings.
The land swap—first proposed in 2003 by Charlesview—and new construction plans drew criticism from some Allston residents, who said that the project would go against the urban planning principles of mixed-income housing and create an income-segregated North Allston neighborhood.
The Community Builders will present its Western Avenue construction plans and discuss logistics with Charlesview residents and community members next Wednesday.
The Community Builders will also present sketches of what the site will look like during and after construction. According to McHale, the apartment towers will be the first to be constructed, followed by the townhouses.
The general contractor, John Moriarty & Associates, and other members of the construction team will also be present to meet Charlesview and other neighborhood residents.
The University expressed excitement about the progression of the project.
“The Charlesview development in Brighton Mills will bring new and improved housing to Charlesview residents and much-needed jobs for the men and women who build it,” University spokesperson Lauren Marshall wrote in an e-mail. “We’ve supported this project and are pleased that it is progressing towards a groundbreaking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard arts community anticipates the culmination of the extensive renovation of the Fogg Museum—currently slated for late 2013—will physically unite the Busch, Sackler, and Fogg Museums and will realign the way that students interact with art.
The building renewal—estimated to cost $350 to $400 million—began in early 2008. According to Harvard Art Museum Director Thomas W. Lentz in 2007, the structure has been overdue for renovations for over 50 years.
“Our goal is to consolidate them on one site, under one roof, as one destination,” Lentz said in an interview last year. “What we like about this idea is that it allows us to have a much greater dialogue between those three collections.”
While initially blueprinted for development in Allston, the Prescott Street museum started the process of its renewal in 2008, after the University’s plans for a centralized museum across the river fell through due to the financial crisis.
No longer to be called the Fogg, the new Harvard Art Museum will encompass collections from the Fogg, the Sackler, and the Busch. The singular institution will have improved storage facilities and a more organized exhibit layout.
In addition, students and faculty will have the chance to contribute to the curating of exhibitions in a more interactive process.
“Students in HAA, History, Hist and Lit—there’s no limit to who can stage an exhibition,” History of Art and Architecture Professor Joseph L. Koerner said.
Much of the artwork displaced by the Fogg renovations is currently being stored in the Sackler, and faculty have turned to increased use of Harvard’s depository in Somerville to compensate for the temporary loss of Fogg classroom space lending itself to interactive art instruction.
“The Somerville depository has seminar rooms in which the faculty have brought students to look at works of art,” Koerner said.
But the renovations have prevented a generation of Harvard students from ever stepping foot into a completed Fogg museum.
Director of Communications for the Harvard Arts Museum Daron J. Manoogian said that the target date remains at 2013 for the completion of the project.
“However, we are continually reassessing that date based on construction logistics,” Manoogian said. “We are still working on the below-grade portion of construc tion before any new construction begins above ground later this year.”

As the national debate over the 2011 federal budget stretches into its sixth month, two Harvard economists called for U.S. lawmakers to tackle long-term spending reforms—including changes to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—in order to regain control over the ballooning federal deficit.
Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who chaired former President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005, criticized Obama’s initial 2011 budget proposal for not endorsing the suggestions of the bipartisan Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to increase the eligibility age for Social Security payments and raise taxes.
“The Commission’s proposal is on the right path,” Mankiw said. “Obama’s budget is pretty much on the wrong path.”
The House Republican budget proposal—which included over 60 billion dollars in cuts to non-mandatory government spending—was shot down by the Democrat-controlled Senate on Wednesday. Mankiw, however, described the proposal “more symbolic than anything else.”
Although Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron expressed support for proposed cuts to federally-funded programs such as NASA, he agreed with Mankiw that the measures do not go far enough. According to Miron, these proposals are “almost irrelevant” if Medicare and Medicaid are not addressed.
“Such a huge fraction of the problem is Medicare and Medicaid, so unless you’re proposing cuts to those it’s almost irrelevant,” he said. “Everything else is basically rounding error.”
While the House Republicans proposed severe cuts to discretionary spending totaling $61 billion, the projected budTget gap for this year is $1.6 trillion.
Even though Senate Majority leader Harry Reid indicated that rejection of the Republican proposal paves the way for negotiations about long-term fiscal sustainability, it is unclear how long it will take for major reforms to be drafted and passed through Congress.
Professor Linda J. Bilmes, Senior Lecturer of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, teaches courses in budgeting and public finance. In an e-mail yesterday, Bilmes threw her support behind the President and warned of the dangers of significant fiscal austerity soon after the financial crisis.
“The country needs a short-term plan to help the economy rebound and a long-term plan to address the imbalance between revenues and expenditures,” she wrote. “Right now we should be investing in the economy, particularly in helping states and cities which provide basic services.”
While the President typically submits a budget for Congressional approval, this is the first time since 1974 that the budget failed to pass the House in time for the beginning of the fiscal year.
In order to keep government operations running, Congress has implemented temporary financing measures, the third of which will expire on March 18.
“Having this budget deficit and looming problems is a little bit like having termites in your house,” Mankiw said. “It’s not like we have to do it today, but the longer we prolong it, the bigger the problem it becomes.”

Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer was appointed acting Pusey Minister of Memorial Church while the search for a permanent appointee begins, the University announced yesterday. He will fill the position left open by the death of Reverend Peter J. Gomes last week.
Meyer, who was appointed as associate minister for administration at the Church this past December, was the associate minister at Memorial Church under Gomes from 1997 to 1999.
“I am enormously grateful that Tad Meyer has agreed to take on this role during such an important moment in the life of Memorial Church and the University,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement.
“We are very lucky to have someone of Tad’s experience, intellect, and sensitivity willing and able to step in during this time of transition,” she said.
Meyer, who previously served as rector at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Beverly Farms, Mass. before returning to Harvard, expressed his enthusiasm for assuming his new position in a statement to The Harvard Gazette.
“I am honored and humbled to be asked to serve the University in this way,” he said. “I look forward to working with colleagues at the church and across Harvard to maintain an active ministry and engaged congregation as the University seeks to identify a permanent leader for the Memorial Church.”
In addition to his role overseeing the general operation of the church, Meyer will act as a liaison to the Harvard chaplains. He will also face the task of operating Memorial Church without Gomes.
Gomes held his position as Memorial Church minister for 35 years, during which time the Church retained a strong presence on campus.
“While attendance at some college churches has dwindled, it has not at all at Memorial Church,” Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey G. Cox Jr. said last week. “Part of the reason for this is the eloquence of Peter’s preaching and his welcoming attitude.”
In a statement, Meyer acknowledged the large size of the shoes he has to fill.
“I think of this assignment as my small but tangible way to honor the memory of Peter Gomes, who was a cherished friend and mentor to me and to so many others,” he said.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chaplain Robert M. Randolph said that Meyer would lead a successful transition.
“Tad has the confidence of Peter Gomes. It assures the transition the church is going through will go well,” Randolph said. “He’s known in the Memorial Church community. He knows the staff and he has their confidence. It’s a master stroke for Harvard.”

After a protracted and controversial process, Stone Hearth Pizza Co.—a local family-style restaurant chain that recently leased a Harvard-owned property in Allston—received approval yesterday to proceed to the next round in its application for a beer and wine license, according to Stone Hearth owner Jonathan Schwarz.
“You don’t know when things can get sidetracked or stopped in the process,” Schwarz said. “I’m thankful that they approved it, and grateful to the community that endorsed us.”
Moving forward on a beer and wine license is the latest step in Harvard long-term effort to bring new tenants to Western Ave. after many business leases expired and University properties were left vacant amid Harvard’s efforts to construct the now delayed Allston Science Complex.
In order to acquire a beer and wine license, Stone Hearth must receive approval from both the City of Boston Licensing Board and the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission.
The City of Boston Licensing Board initially granted Stone Hearth’s application for a license in December, but then revoked its approval due to a zoning discrepancy.
Stone Hearth had applied for a beer and wine license reserved for businesses in “urban renewal areas”—special zones that the Boston Redevelopment Authority designates in need of revitalization.
Schwarz and his business partner, Christopher Robbins, said they did not realize the “urban renewal area” across the street does not include their own property, according to Schwarz.
The Allston Civic Association had also recommended against Stone Hearth’s proposal to occupy 182 Western Ave. in an 8-6 vote in October that hinged on residents’ concerns with Stone Hearth’s plan to request a beer and wine license.
Stone Hearth’s lease is part of the University’s effort to revitalize Western Ave. and fulfill its long-held promise to transform the avenue into a thriving “main street” since halting construction on the Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009.
“We are working very hard to attract the kind of locally-owned, family-friendly use that our neighbors wanted  to see in the former Citgo gas station and are pleased that Stone Hearth is finalizing their plans and will be enlivening Barry’s Corner in just a few months,” wrote University spokesperson Lauren Marshall in an e-mail.
Over the past 12 months, the University has leased property in Allston to 13 businesses and non-profit organizations—including Genzyme, the Silk Road Project, and the Boston Boxing Club—according to University spokesperson John D. Longbrake. The University’s lease to Stone Hearth at 182 Western Ave. is the most recent such agreement.
“I hope this will transform an abandoned gas station to what I hope is a warm and welcoming space for everyone who lives and works around us,” Schwarz said.

Harvard has the best university reputation in the world, according to the Times Higher Education’s seventh annual 2011 World University Reputation Rankings.
The British publication, affiliated with Thomson Reuters, scored Harvard a perfect 100, matching a similar top placement in the Times’ general rankings released last year.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology followed in second, with Ivies Princeton and Yale receiving ranks of seven and nine respectively.
Calculated based upon 13 key indicators, the World University Reputation Rankings assesses survey responses on learning environment, prevalence of research, and student-staff diversity, according to the report.
Information was gathered from more than 13,000 surveys distributed to university faculties from 131 different countries.
The other top five contenders included, in order, Cambridge University, the University of California at Berkeley, and Stanford University.
Harvard was the only university to receive a 100 in the reputation rating, and the five schools directly below ranged from 68.7 to 85.0 points.
Below these rankings, the reputation ratings drop significantly. Princeton received a 36.6 point rating and Osaka University in Japan—the 50th ranked school—received a 5.9 rating.
“Our survey suggests that there are only a handful of globally recognized brands in higher education,” the report states.
According to the report, a well-known brand or international reputation can serve as one of the most important features of a university in attracting the top students.
Indeed, the Times reported a wide range between reputation rankings and rank and academic scores for some universities.
The University of Massachusetts, for instance, was ranked 19 in the rankings based on reputation, while it received a 56 in the Times’ general rankings.
Students at Harvard said a strong reputation has its advantages, including in the job search.
“People take your ideas more seriously if you have something like Harvard to back them up,” Aticus A. Peterson ’14. “It makes people listen.”
But others maintained that reputation is not everything.
“School rankings did not play a big role in my decision to come here,” said Melissa J. Sieffert ’14. “It was not the numbers it was the community.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: MAR. 16, 2011
The Mar. 11 article "Harvard Wins in Global Brand Rankings" incorrectly stated Yale's ranking in the survey. It ranked ninth, not tenth.

Those who had been closest to President Reagan glowingly praised his pragmatic political outlook and persistent sense of humor at the Institute of Politics last night where a panel gathered to celebrate President Reagan’s legacy in the year that would have been his 100th birthday.
Moderated by Mark Halperin, a senior political analyst at MSNBC, the panel included Lou Cannon, a former White House correspondent, Ken Duberstein, President Reagan’s Chief of Staff from 1988 to 1989, Kennedy School Professor Roger B. Porter, the director of the White House Office of Policy Development during the Reagan administration, and Sheila Tate, Nancy Reagan’s press secretary from 1981 to 1985.
All the panelists—each of whom had a personal connection to the former president—agreed that much of Reagan’s political success could be derived from his pragmatic attitude, which helped him turn his ideas into policies.
Duberstein quoted President George H.W. Bush in calling Reagan the “ultimate pragmatist” who realized that the only way to success was to approach progress in “bite sized pieces.”
“He knew why he wanted to become president,” Duberstein said. “He knew what he would do when he became president and he knew how he wanted to get that done.”
Porter added that this pragmatic approach was particularly important to Reagan, who had to work with a Democratic legislature both as governor of California and during his time as President.
“I never got the impression that he thought a lot about the political calculations of how [his actions] might affect him electorally, but he thought a lot about how I am going to get [his policies] accomplished,” Porter said.
Cannon said that another of Reagan’s greatest strengths was his ability to identify with the American people. When asked on the eve of Reagan’s presidential election what the American people saw in him, Cannon said Reagan responded by saying that he saw himself as one of the people—a feeling he said he could never separate himself from.
“The greatness of Reagan was that America was inside of him,” said Cannon.
Looking behind the scenes of the administration, Tate elaborated on the role that the former First Lady Nancy Reagan played in caring for her husband. According to Tate, she worked diligently to maximize Reagan’s potential, whether by monitoring his schedule to prevent it from becoming overwhelming or by helping him navigate his political relationships.
“Ronald Reagan trusted everybody and Nancy was the verifier,” Duberstein said. “He was always better when she was in the equation.”
Although the event provided the audience with personal insights into the Reagan presidency, Can Soylu ’14 said that he wished that the event had provided a slightly more critical approach to the events of Reagan’s political career.

Eight writers for feminist publications gathered in Ticknor Lounge yesterday to discuss feminist activism in the blogosphere as part of Feminist Coming Out Day, a campaign started by Harvard’s queer and feminist student groups in 2010 to raise awareness about diversity among supporters of gender equality.
“After Feminist Coming Out Day last year, we asked, ‘Once you come out as a feminist, what do you do then?’ We provided a platform for people to speak about what feminism is, but we had no platform for further action,” said Abby P. Sun ’13, co-president of Feminist Coming Out Day and co-chair of the Radcliffe Union of Students.
Sun said the panel was designed to expose students to online outlets for feminist activism.
The discussion featured Chloe Angyal and Lori M. Adelman ’08 from Feministing.com, Julie Zeilinger from The F-Bomb, Cherie Hannouche from The Daily Femme, Andrea Plaid from Racialicious, Sady Doyle from Tiger Beatdown, Anna North from Jezebel, and Lena Chen ’10, creator of The Chicktionary.
“The idea among older feminists is that younger feminists aren’t doing anything or have given up goals of feminism,” said event organizer and moderator Samantha A. Meier ’12. “Our generation of feminists has a different set of tools and a different style of organizing than feminists in the 80s,”
Panelists highlighted the challenges inherent in the blogging medium, which include integrating the voices of men, queer women, and people of color into the mainstream blogging community and coping with inflammatory comments by readers.
Chen, a former board member of Queer Students and Allies, described her “feminist click moment” as a college sophomore when she started a blog about her sex life, which attracted a negative backlash.
“My junior year I decided that putting too much of my life online made me and people in my life vulnerable,” Chen said. “So I shut down that website and started Chicktionary, which still used my personal experience as a lens to inform my writing, but to a lesser degree.”
Racialicious blogger Andrea Plaid discussed how social media has been employed in feminist organizing projects. Recently, feminist groups mobilized to take down an anti-abortion billboard that read, “The most dangerous place for an African American is in the womb.”
Sady Doyle from Tiger Beatdown discussed her recent Twitter campaign to respond to the “victim-blaming” and “rape apologism” that she said has characterized Michael Moore’s dismissal of Julian Assange’s sexual assault allegations.
“Its important both to understand the limitations and the potential of Facebook and Twitter, and how social media can add to and complicate traditional activism,” Meier said. “This isn’t a dead movement.”

Even  in what an anonymous senior has  called "possibly the jokiest semester at Harvard yet,"  the Crimson’s athletes often have to rely on hearsay and history to find  light courses with their already busy schedules. Team lists, Facebook  threads, and text messages are all used to balance the demands of  critical coaches and courses.
 
When  picking comfortable concentrations, less jarring general education  courses, or easy electives, some teammates may flock to seniors and  captains for how to navigate through arguably the most challenging  curriculum this country has to offer. 
 
Some  3,000 miles away, in the calm repose of California, Stanford’s athletes  have been lucky enough to go to a school which does this for them.
 
Every  quarter since 2001, the University’s Athletic Academic Resource Center  has come out with a list of options, titled "Courses of Interest", sure  to be low in the work category and chock full of other athletes to  better accommodate for afternoon practices and away trips.
 
Interestingly  enough, more than 200 courses, which still fit in between the golden  hours of 10am to 1pm and never met on weekends, were left off the  list.
 
Even strangers is the fact that most of this has been done in secrecy. Besides  athletes and the athletic staff, most Stanford students and  administrators have been largely unaware of the list’s existence.
 
Wondering  what was actually on this holy grail for one of the country’s top-tier  programs? Courses like a drama class in Beginning Improvising, Social  Dances in North America III, and dozens more of easy electives for general education.
 
Expecting  Harvard to follow suit? Don’t count on it. Stanford has been said to  have discontinued the list after reporters began to inquire into it last  week.
 
Keep dreaming, Crimson.

As the Harvard men’s basketball team’s fans stormed the court in ebullient jubilation last Saturday evening in celebration of the squad clinching a share of its first ever Ivy League Championship, there was one thing they understandably might have forgotten—this wasn’t quite over yet.
No, Princeton could still force a one-game playoff with a win over Penn in its final game of the regular season, and the Tigers did just that by knocking off the Quakers, 70-58, on Tuesday night. Now, a rematch is required between the league co-champions for the right to represent the Ancient Eight in the NCAA Tournament.
“It would’ve been nice [to avoid a playoff], but it wouldn’t have been right,” sophomore forward Kyle Casey said. “This is the way it should be, and everyone’s excited to play them again ... it’s definitely going to be a fight.”
Harvard has not participated in March Madness since 1946, when a 39-37 Crimson victory over Yale earned Harvard an at-large bid. Now, the Crimson will have to go through New Haven again, the neutral site where the playoff will be played at the John J. Lee Amphitheater tomorrow at 4 p.m.
“We’ve been able to accomplish incredible goals so far,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “It would be an incredible opportunity for us if we could take this on into the NCAA tournament, and we certainly recognize how much of a challenge, how difficult that will be against a really good Princeton team.”
The squads split their two matchups this year, with the Tigers winning, 65-61, at home on Feb. 4 and Harvard emerging victorious, 79-67, last Saturday.
Casey led the team in the most recent game, putting together his best performance of the season by scoring 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting.
But the sophomore also fouled out once the contest was out of reach, and if the Crimson is going to win tomorrow, it will be essential that Casey and junior center Keith Wright—named the Ivy League Player of the Year Wednesday night—stay out of foul trouble.
That will be no easy task against the Princeton frontcourt of senior Kareem Maddox and sophomore Ian Hummer, who like to attack the basket and have caused matchup problems for Harvard in the past.
“Those guys are great players,” Wright said. “They work hard, especially on the offensive end, so it’s going to be a tough matchup.”
In addition to containing Maddox and Hummer, the Crimson defense will also need to do a good job defending Princeton senior guard Dan Mavraides, who kept his team in the first half of Saturday’s game by torching Harvard for 18 points on six-of-eight shooting. The task of stopping him will likely be left to sophomore point guard Brandyn Curry–the team’s best perimeter defender–who after switching to Mavraides in the second half held the senior to just 3-of-12 from the field.
If Mavraides or junior backcourt mate Doug Davis do get hot from the perimeter, the pair’s shooting ability will likely need to be matched by the Crimson wings—specifically sophomore Christian Webster and freshman Laurent Rivard—stepping up and knocking down threes.
The Crimson shot 41 percent from long distance in wins this year, compared with 25 percent in losses (including starting out 1-of-16 at Princeton). It is thus key that Harvard comes out hot from behind the arc. But Princeton had the best three-point field goal percentage defense in the conference during the regular season, making that task all the more difficult.
The Crimson and the Tigers were one-two in the conference in scoring margin during the regular season, and both feature deep rosters with multiple players that can carry the team for any given stretch. Maddox, Hummer, Mavraides, and Davis all ranked in the top 20 in Ivy scoring for Princeton, while Wright, Webster, and Rivard did so for Harvard.
The game could come down to a battle on the glass, with Wright, Maddox, Hummer, and Casey all averaging over six rebounds per contest. That quartet was also ranked one-through-four, respectively, in in the Ancient Eight in field goal percentage during the regular season.
“We’re going to have to defend the three-point line and really rebound and box out,” Wright said. “That’s going to be a big key.”
Amaker also stressed that Harvard would be much more comfortable with a quick, high scoring game, such as the one at Lavietes Pavilion last Saturday.
“We need to have a pace to our game,” the coach said. “When you think about the losses we’ve had against Princeton, the scores were in the 50s, and low 60s. [Last] game it got up and down the floor.”
Both Amaker and Casey also acknowledged that it would be important to not let the high of last week lead to a letdown tomorrow.
“They definitely have the edge,” Casey said. “They sat and watched us celebrate. But there’s not going to be any letdown.  We know what’s at stake, and what we have to come out and do ... we’ll be ready.”
Amaker has not coached in the NCAA tournament since 2000 with Seton Hall, when he reached the Sweet 16. Harvard, of course, has not reached the tournament in far longer a time period.
“The best thing we can do to turn anything around is to have success,” Amaker said at his introductory press conference in April 2007. “I certainly feel like it is going to be a joyous ride.”
The ride has been long, but the joy and success have come. All that’s left to do is dance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a sweep of the seventh-seeded Clarkson Golden Knights, the 10th-seeded Harvard men’s hockey team (11-19-1, 7-14-1) reached the quarterfinals of the ECAC Hockey Championship last weekend.
If the Crimson hopes to advance to the ECAC semifinals for the seventh time in 10 years, it will need to pull off another upset.
Harvard’s quarterfinal opponent is a familiar foe, third-seeded Dartmouth College (12-8-2, 6-3-1 Ivy). The two teams have squared off on the ice twice this season, with the Big Green coming out on top both times by scores of 8-2 and 5-2. This weekend’s best-of-three quarterfinal series will kick off tonight at Dartmouth’s Thompson Arena in Hanover, N.H.
One key player to watch in this matchup is the Big Green’s Nick Walsh. When the Crimson met Dartmouth earlier this season, it had little success defending the junior forward, as he tallied up a hat trick in the first game and scored again in the second. The Big Green is hopeful that Walsh can continue his good fortune against Harvard on tonight and tomorrow.
On the Crimson side, key contributors will be sophomore defender Danny Biega and junior forward Alex Killorn. Biega and Killorn have come up big for Harvard all season, and were awarded All-Ivy honors.
Also look for senior forward Michael Biega to make an impact on the ice. Michael Biega was recently named ECAC Hockey MLX Skates Player of the Week for his performance in Harvard’s road sweep of Clarkson in the first round.
In the most recent game between Harvard and the Big Green, Michael Biega was inactive. With him on the ice this weekend, members of the Crimson squad insist that this game will be a different story.
“Those losses came at a time in our season when we weren’t playing too well,” said Harvard co-captain Michael Del Mauro. “We’re looking at this game with a completely different perspective because we’re a completely different team.”
In recent weeks, Harvard has been playing at a higher level. The team’s early-season losses to Dartmouth were part of a seven-game losing streak. Coming into this weekend’s series, the Crimson has won five straight and is still looking to improve.
“Right now, we’re playing the best hockey we’ve played all season,” Harvard co-captain Chris Huxley said. “But we can still be better.”
The Big Green is heading into its matchup with the Crimson having lost three of its last four games. In its most recent game, played at home against Clarkson, Dartmouth took an early lead and watched it disappear as the Golden Knights scored four unanswered goals.
But the Crimson is not underestimating the Big Green, even after its recent woes.
“They play good hockey,” Huxley said. “They had a week off because they’re a top-four seed, so we know they’ll be rested.”
Whether or not Harvard will be able to stick to its style of play will be instrumental in determining its success in the quarterfinal matchup.
“This weekend’s outcome is contingent upon us playing the game that we’ve been playing the last ten games or so,” Del Mauro said. “It’s about us being committed to our game plan and what gave us success against Clarkson.”
Last weekend’s sweep of the Golden Knights boosted morale inside the Harvard locker room. Players are pleased with the two games that they put together against Clarkson and are eager to try to carry the trend of this year’s upset-ridden ECAC Hockey Championships.
“When you sweep a team on the road, it provides a lot of confidence,” Del Mauro said. “More than that, the fact that we played the game like a team that we are really proud of gave us more confidence than simply winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As most students head out to warm destinations or back to their hometowns, many of the Harvard sports teams are gearing up for trips to warmer weather as well, or are dedicating time to focus on their athletics without the stress of academics.
First, the men’s and women’s crew teams will be staying in Cambridge and training for the spring season.
The teams have just finished the indoor season and began rowing outdoors on the river on Sunday.
“Many of [the crew team members] are excited about getting to row on the river,” sophomore heavyweight Courtney Diekema said. “But, the indoor season was an awesome time to build fitness.”
Even though the crew teams aren’t travelling during Spring Break, the Crimson went on a major trip to Orlando during winter break.
The teams’ trip gave Harvard an opportunity to train outdoors while most of New England was covered in snow,.
In Florida, the Harvard and Radcliffe crews were able to focus solely on rowing without the normal constraints of the school year.
“It was great to train without having to worry about [academics],” Diekema said.
The crew team has its first competition the weekend after students return from spring break on March 26 at Tulsa.
Spring break will give the team the opportunity to continue a difficult training regimen before having to gear up for competition season the following week.
The track and field team will be heading down to Houston on Sunday for a weeklong training camp.
“Spring break is a great chance to train outside and get warmed up for the outdoor season,” said senior distance runner Claire Richardson. “[The spring break trip] is also a great time to bond with the team and train without having to deal with the colder weather.”
The track and field team’s itinerary consists of a full week of training, culminating in two competitions at the end of the week at the Rice Multi Meet on March 16 and the Texas Southern Relays on March 18.
The multi-event meet will give heptathletes their first javelin competitions of the year, and the sprinters now will return to the traditional 100m and 110 meter hurdles, in contrast to the 60m sprint races during the indoor season.
The softball team is headed west, and the baseball team is headed south for their spring break training trips.
The baseball team has an 11-game road trip from March 11-20, during which the Crimson will visit Wofford, Mercer, Kennesaw State, Georgia State, and Charlotte.
The team looks for its first win after a four-game opening skid against Jacksonville State last weekend.
Harvard will face stiff competition as each of the teams they will be matching up against boasts a winning record.
The softball team will head to the west coast for its Spring Break, visiting Riverside for the UCR Tournament from March 11-13 and the San Diego Classic II from March 17-19.
The squad travelled to Boca Raton, Fl., for its opening tournament at Florida Atlantic.
The softball team is looking to build on their 3-2 start last weekend and will head to St. Louis, which should provide tough competition for the Crimson.
The Billikens are riding an 11-4 start and went undefeated in the Magic City Classic.
Even though this spring break will not be filled with classes, the Harvard athletic teams will have a busy workload with competition throughout the break.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the entire campus caught up in basketball fever, some of Harvard’s other winter sports are due recognition as well: in particular, the Crimson men and women’s fencing teams, who are heading to Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., this Sunday to compete in the NCAA regional championships. Last year Harvard qualified the maximum of 12 fencers for national competition and is hoping to repeat the feat this year.
Competition is divided into three blade classes: the foil—a light thrusting weapon, the epee—a heavier blade used for thrusting, and the sabre—used more for slashing. Each gender can qualify two fencers in each class, and the national championship will take place in Columbus, Ohio, later in March. Men’s and women’s competition points are combined at the end of competition, so everyone who makes it to the championships will be representing the Crimson together.
The men’s team has found incredible success this season, both as a team and individually. The squad goes into regionals with a 19-2 record, and several of its members have received international acclaim. Freshman Michael Raynis from California was selected to represent the United States in the World Junior Fencing Championships (WJFC), and his teammate sophomore Ben White will also attend as a representative of his home country England. The WJFC will be held in Jordan only five days after the NCAA championships.
The women’s team has had a strong season as well. Led by freshman Alexandra Kiefer, sophomore Katherine Chou, and junior Shelby Macleod, the team marched to an 18-5 record over the course of the season. It swept the Beanpot last month, making Harvard’s women fencing the only team to ever win the Beanpot title over its four-year history.

After weeks of anticipation—punctuated by the release of YouTube videos promoting every House—Housing Day has finally come and gone. Two Houses snuck into the video melee at the last minute with flicks to charm freshmen just before they received their housing assignments.
Pfoho released yet another in a long string of videos, an ode to the House called "Pforget You" to the tune of the similarly titled Cee Lo Green song.
 
Currier's latest video attempts to fight the stereotypes associated with the Quad. The video showcases a variety of House residents whose hobbies range from filmmaking to drinking to running for Congress, all proudly proclaiming, "I'm a Currierite."
