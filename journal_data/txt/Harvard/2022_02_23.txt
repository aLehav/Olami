After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was in middle school, my history teacher taught my class about “the shot heard round the world”: the first gunshot fired by a soldier at the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 18, 1775. This marked the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, a rebellion that would inspire other nations for decades to come. As a child, I was fascinated by this idea that the entire world could feel the impact of a single person’s actions. Eventually, I would come to learn that this was not the only time that the world had come to a halt — nor would it be the last.
At least once in our lifetimes, we all hear another shot — a tragedy that stops the world. In that moment, time freezes. For my father, it was the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. For my mother, it was the murder of John Lennon. For me, it was the murder of George Floyd.
In the summer of 2020, George Floyd was everywhere: my Instagram timeline, my Twitter feed, my television screen. Everywhere I looked I was reminded that, much like Eric Garner, a police officer choked George Floyd until he could no longer breathe — all because his Blackness was seen as a weapon.
We live in a world where Black people have to hold their breath and fear for their lives when they spot flashing lights of red and blue in their rearview mirror. A world where a police officer gets to decide whether a Black man deserves to breathe. While George Floyd was not the first Black man to die while in police custody, his death prompted more public outrage than I had ever seen. Protesters took to the streets demanding that justice be served and change be made. I watched the world stop as it cried for George Floyd, recognizing a reality that I had known for years: our country was flawed and our system was broken.
The murder of George Floyd was a wakeup call to the American public and my generation. A magnifying glass that exposed the cracks in our system to the untrained eye. But these issues are not new. We were not the first generation to take to the streets to fight back against this unjust system. Nor were we the first generation to look at the world around us and shudder at the horrors we saw. This fight began years ago, with our mothers and our fathers. With our aunts and uncles. With our grandparents and our great-grandparents. My own family’s fight trails all the way back to my great-great-uncle and aunt who marched alongside Dr. King and other Civil Rights leaders in the March on Washington and the Selma to Montgomery March.
Yet, here we are, decades later, facing the same problems they faced, fighting the same fights they fought, and marching the same streets they marched.
The sound of a gunshot can last three to five milliseconds, and, for a single moment in time, that shot can be heard around the world. While the entire world stops in that moment — stunned silent and recoiling from the impact — it does not take very long for a state of normalcy to return and for everything to be set back into motion. Life goes on for those who do not have to worry about a similar fate. They return to their daily lives until they hear the next shot, moving on without healing the country’s previous wound.
As we take time this month to celebrate the beauties of what it means to be Black in America and all of the rich history that comes along with it, we mourn all of the Black lives lost simply because of the melanin that enriches their skin. And so, as we smile, laugh, and cry, we will also wait. Wait for the other shoe to drop. For the next life to be lost. For the next trial to begin. For the next sentencing to occur. For the next shot to be heard around the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alfred B. Nobel’s 1895 will reads, in part:
“All of my remaining realisable assets are to be disbursed as follows: the capital, converted to safe securities by my executors, is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” including “one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement.”
Though Nobel’s family was dismayed at this prospect, after five years of debate, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1901. Since then the Academy has continued to do so annually, save for eight years throughout the 20th century when no winners were awarded. Honorees of this prestigious award receive a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of Swedish crowns equivalent to approximately $1 million.
Chemistry undergraduates will immediately recognize the first three laureates’ names. We encounter Henry van ‘t Hoff, winner of the 1901 prize, through the van ‘t Hoff equation in thermodynamics. Organic chemistry students become familiar with Emil Fischer, the 1902 laureate, via the Fischer esterification reaction and learning to draw Fischer projections. And every student of kinetics has analyzed at least a few Arrhenius plots, named for 1903 laureate Svante Arrhenius, at some point in their career.
What chemist wouldn’t want to join this pantheon of great scientists? Of course all scientists want their work to “confer the greatest benefit to humankind.” At what point, however, does pursuit of the Nobel lose its nobility?
The truth is that “Nobel fever” has infected many chemists and scientists, seeping into undergraduate educations and institutions everywhere. From the very first semester of organic chemistry, a graduate student half-jokingly suggests that for solving a great question in chemistry, you’ll win a Nobel prize. The importance of the Nobel becomes increasingly clear as professors tell us which concepts in our curriculum had won a Nobel prize in this or that year, as if its importance were validated by only the prize and not its effect on the greater world. We talk about great chemists in class as dying controversially without a Nobel, (like cross-coupling pioneer John K. Stille) as if the prize were divine judgment, with Saint Peter at the gates of heaven asking to see your gold medal before granting entry.
Frequent talk about the Nobel is not particularly motivating to undergraduates, though. More relevant to us is the content of the science — not the industry’s plaudits. The abstruse rules of the prize, such as only three individuals maximum being allowed to share one award, are inconsistent with the collaborative nature of science that we are taught to embrace and value. The system perpetuates itself: Students impressed with the Nobel’s importance will go on to view scientific achievement through this golden lens that overlooks the crucial contributions of every team member. Harvard flaunts its faculty Nobel laureates, posting extensive interviews and reaction videos with them, as if to set the expectation that professors here should be attracting Sweden’s attention. Former Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber’s recent conviction, in which he cited Nobel aspirations, is just another consequence of working with an eye towards the Nobel.
Chemistry is widely called “the central science” for its middle position between the physical and life sciences. Lieber himself straddled the two, his research focusing on developing nanomaterials and electronics to help treat brain diseases and injuries. Chemists worldwide come to work every day to advance not just chemistry, but physics, materials science, biology, and medicine as well. Our field’s interdisciplinary work is one of its most valuable and irreplaceable strengths. We hope that this spirit of collaboration will continue to animate chemistry research everywhere.
Chemistry’s centrality has never been more apparent: The solutions to many of the world’s most pressing issues, from Covid-19 to climate change and global hunger, all depend, in one way or another, on the work of chemists and the entire scientific community. As students who make up the next generation of scientists, we affirm the power that chemical institutions have to fight diseases, preserve the natural world, and improve humanity’s quality of life. We are grateful to have role models who believe the same.
It’s time for science to free itself from Stockholm’s yoke. After all, those who stay up late waiting for a certain midnight call will sleep through saving the world in the morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dearest Readers,
It is with great concern that I announce the presence of a pernicious and rapidly growing infestation throughout Harvard’s campus. In a matter of weeks, it has found its way into every classroom, dorm, and dining hall, and while protocol is already in place for handling such infestations, this particular occurrence has proven highly resistant to conventional treatments. The CDC has issued a statement describing the situation as, “really bad… probably? I mean, I dunno. We really only do disease stuff,” and that one guy from your Gov lecture has called it, “hella wack.”
It is therefore strongly advised that all residents proceed with extreme caution, for Harvard has become hopelessly and completely infested…by negative attitudes. Yup. Now I know that sounds like something your second grade teacher might say after little Johnny decides to break all the purple crayons, but you know what? Second grade teachers know what’s up! And surely, you guys have noticed this too.
Harvard students love to complain. A lot. Like, it borders on ritualistic.
A typical interaction might look like this: someone asks you how your day was. You sigh and explain that “it all started when the dining hall ran out of lemon smoked salmon.” Of course, what you should be saying is, “Woah. The dining hall had smoked salmon? That’s crazy!”
Too often, our minds tend to fixate on the negative. We obsess over things we don’t have. We constantly compare ourselves to others. We critique before we compliment. To be fair, as a satirist – and more importantly, as a low-income Latina – it’s abundantly clear that an elite institution like Harvard has a lot to critique. But that work gets tiring, fast. And if we forget to take stock of the amazing gifts we have, we risk losing our ability to see them in the first place.
So, because Harvard no longer has a Gen Ed course devoted to “Positive Psychology,” I’m gonna give us all a crash course the only way I know how – through the educational medium of obscure insects! Here’s how this will work: I’ll present you with an imaginary scenario, and together, we’ll talk through some possible positive and negative responses. Naturally, insects will be featured prominently. You’re welcome.
Okay, it’s time for class so you begin your daily trek from the Quad. Some people might complain that the Quad is “too far,” but this is because they are dead inside. In truth, the daily exercise means you are now hot as hell with legs for days.
You enter your first class. Some people complain that the professor is boring, but judging by her faculty bio, the Pulitzer Prize committee disagreed. In the middle of the classroom is a giant millipede, otherwise known as “Archispirostreptus gigas.” There’s no metaphor here. It’s literally just a giant millipede. Some people might complain, “Uggghhh. It’s sooo annoying when non-sentient millipedes audit Harvard lectures.” But they are just jealous of the millipede’s 4.0 grade point average. In truth, millipede’s have tons of rad traits!
For example, the “Archispirostreptus gigas” is the world’s largest species of millipede, and has anywhere from three to four-hundred legs. Talk about athletically gifted, am I right? Not only does this make them every crew team’s dream, but you just know all those appendages would look great in a varsity sweater.
Moreover, giant millipedes are self-proclaimed pacifists. If threatened, they simply curl into a ball and secrete an odorous substance to fend off the attacker. Coincidentally – curling into a ball and releasing odors is an excellent way to win a fight in real life. If the Harvard wrestling team adopted this strategy, I’m sure they would end their season undefeated.
Now, if you’ve read this far and find yourself thinking, “Wow, Mireya. This was such a great exercise! It’s so refreshing to focus on the good in things, and, although we’ve never met, it seems like you’d have a great taste in music!” Then congrats. You are now ready to face Harvard’s infestation with a renewed appreciation for life’s gifts.
But if, instead, you instead find yourself thinking, “Wow. This article had, like, zero foreign policy references. So lame. Also, millipedes aren’t insects – they’re arthropods. How does Mireya not know that?!” Then it seems you are beyond my, or the millipede’s, help.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yamba Market, Cambridge’s first recreational marijuana dispensary, will open in Central Square by the beginning of March.
The Black-owned business received the green light from the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission earlier this month. Entrepreneurs Sean D. Hope and Sieh Samura plan to open the shop at 580 Massachusetts Ave.
Hope said he believes the business’s opening will pave the way for future minority-owned businesses to participate in the marijuana market.
“Oftentimes people say that Cambridge is America's classroom,” he said. “The lessons learned in this case is that if you provide minority and small businesses an opportunity — even during an international pandemic, even when retail really is changing, because everyone is so used to using your phones and getting things brought to you — that an innovative Black-owned business like Yamba Market can come forward and can thrive.”
Hope’s involvement in the cannabis industry includes legally representing one of the state’s leading medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries. Samura, a longtime activist for cannabis legalization and policy, said he first got involved in cannabis advocacy after learning the benefits of medicinal marijuana.
“We've been on the frontlines fighting for real social justice,” Samura said. “There's a lot of people coming into the space, but I represent the people that made this space and that maintained this space and that advocated for this space when it wasn't cool.”
Hope and Samura’s goal is for Yamba Market to operate as both a dispensary and educational resource on cannabis for residents in the greater Boston area, according to Samura.
“We want to be the first place that they come for cannabis knowledge,” Samura said. “We are an authority for supporting a positive adult cannabis lifestyle and the communities that benefit from that.”
“We normalize, we remove the stigma, we change culture, we support people to experience cannabis in the best way,” he added.
Hope said Yamba Market differentiates itself from other dispensaries by offering all visitors an “experiential” visit, regardless of whether they purchase product. At its entrance, the business boasts an open space adorned with lounge areas, artwork, and baskets imported from West African artisans.
Attached to the main dispensary is The Joint, an additional space where visitors who do not consume the product can enjoy artwork, purchase non-regulated merchandise, and attend regular art events.
By June, Hope and Samura aim to open their next store — Yamba Boutique — in Harvard Square. The pair also hopes to launch “Yamba Life” as a “lifestyle brand, focusing on health, wellness, art and creativity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pair of top political pollsters said Tuesday that the fast-moving foreign policy crisis in Ukraine and the uncertain trajectory of Covid-19 in the United States have cast uncertainty over the 2022 midterm elections, which will shape the latter half of President Joe Biden’s first term.
The pollsters — John Anzalone and Tony Fabrizio, who worked for Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, respectively, during the 2020 presidential campaign — spoke at a forum held Tuesday by the Harvard Institute of Politics. The talk was moderated by Gerald F. Seib, the Washington Street Journal’s executive Washington editor who currently serves as a spring 2022 IOP resident fellow.
The firms led by Anzalone and Fabrizio jointly conduct a quarterly political poll for the Wall Street Journal. The first iteration of the survey, which was released in December, showed that Americans hold largely pessimistic views of the future. Sixty-three percent of respondents indicated they believe the country “is headed in the wrong direction,” a change from previous sentiments.
“People were optimistic that things were going to be better for the next generation. Now, the answer is no,” Seib said in an interview following the event. “That’s a very big change.”
Fabrizio said the country’s poor expectations for the future present a problem for the Democrats in the midterms.
“When people … don’t see light at the end of the tunnel, that’s when it really becomes problematic for the party in power,” Fabrizio said.
The poll also showed a split between the issues that Americans believe each political party is equipped to manage. Voters trust Congressional Democrats more to handle healthcare affordability, the pandemic, and Social Security, the survey showed. But it showed higher levels of trust for Congressional Republicans on the economy, combating crime, and how to “deal with China.”
The panelists also discussed the domestic political impact of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
“There’s a lot of little problems that can spill back here, exacerbating problems that already exist,” Fabrizio said. “What are we going to do about the prices of ground beef that have gone up and the prices of avocados?”
The Wall Street Journal poll estimated that 14 percent of voters remain undecided going into the midterms — including a disproportionate number of people of color and young people.
“The media consumption for young voters has just plummeted to a point where we’re almost not reaching them now,” Anzalone said. “The big concern for Democrats — because they’re mostly Democrats — is that they just don’t come out to vote.”
In an interview after the event, Seib pointed to disillusionment among young people as a reason behind low turnout at the polls.
“There’s a tendency, or at least a temptation, for young voters to get so discouraged at the difficulty of changing the system for the better that they simply give up and walk away,” Seib said. “I think it takes work by the parties, by candidates, and by people like the groups on this campus to keep reminding voters it does matter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students in the Phillips Brooks House Association phoned Massachusetts state representatives at a Tuesday event held by the group in support of a Covid-19 housing equity bill making its way through the state legislature.
Student volunteers in attendance were members of PBHA’s Housing Opportunities Program, an undergraduate group focused on combating homelessness in the Greater Boston area. The bill intends to extend eviction and foreclosure prevention measures instituted by the state during the pandemic.
More than 100,000 Mass. households struggled to pay their mortgages in September 2020 due to recent unemployment, according to estimates from the Boston-based Metropolitan Area Planning Council. Most of the legislation pausing evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic is coming to an end early this year, and some policies have already expired.
HOP kicked off the phone banking event Tuesday to raise awareness about ongoing housing issues and recruit more volunteers, according to the program’s Director of Advocacy Sophie S. Goodman ’25.
“It really aligns with a lot of our mission in terms of eviction prevention, keeping people in housing,” Goodman said. “The measures in this bill are really important, especially at this time.”
“One thing that we, as a group, found really appealing about the bill is measures to ensure that landlords work with tenants to find rental assistance before giving an eviction notice,” she added.
The bill aims to support both homeowners and renters and increase the accessibility of rental assistance, including for low-income individuals and people of color.
Goodman said accessibility remains an issue with the current housing assistance programs available.
“Something that we’ve discussed is that there’s assistance out there, but a lot of it is difficult to access,” she said.
Goodman also said she believes Tuesday’s event serves as a reminder that housing instability wrought by the pandemic persists.
“Especially in places like Harvard, it’s almost like we’re feeling like, ‘Oh, the pandemic’s a little bit over,’ and we’re almost forgetting how much of an impact it’s still having on people,” she said.

Legal and medical experts discussed how to support families struggling with substance abuse in a Tuesday virtual panel jointly hosted by Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Law, Brain, and Behavior and Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.
Stephanie Tabashneck — a senior fellow in law and applied neuroscience at the centers — moderated the discussion and began her presentation with an anecdote about an expectant mother of three children who suffers from opioid use disorder, anxiety, and depression.
“Julie desires to have a healthy pregnancy but feels ambivalent about going to the hospital for treatment right now and is worried about how her pregnancy will be viewed by [the Department of Children and Families],” Tabashneck said.
Former family court judge Beth A. Crawford, a panelist at the event, noted how those struggling with addiction — like Julie — rarely have the resources to stay the course of their treatment plan.
“Julie was given a service plan to address her opioid use disorder and was given contact information about how to do so,” Crawford said. “Her substance use disorder and her lack of city housing, lack of a telephone just made it really impossible for her to do what she needed to do.”
Crawford said introducing a family drug court would have enabled Julie to be substantially more “successful.”
“Julie would have worked with the program's family social worker to learn skills to safely parent her children and also to understand her children's experience with substance use disorder,” Crawford said. “She would have been in the program for about 18 months before graduating.”
Panelist Davida M. Schiff, director of perinatal and family-based substance use disorder care at MGH, focused on medical care that could support people in early recovery during pregnancy.
Schiff began her presentation by discussing MGH's Harnessing Support for Opioid and Substance Use Disorders in Pregnancy and Early Childhood Clinic, or HOPE Clinic, which provides care for pregnant women with substance use disorders.
The effectiveness of early intervention programs like the HOPE clinic, according to Schiff, are manifold and are directly linked to “improved maternal and neonatal outcomes with lower preterm birth, lower placental abruption and less fetal demise.”
On the role of the law, Schiff commented on the ineffective and detrimental prosecution of pregnant people who struggle with addiction.
“Prosecution of pregnant people with substance use disorder drives them from treatment, and it risks poor outcomes — for both mom and baby,” Schiff said. “Despite almost all professional organizations affirming the need for a public health response, we're seeing actually an increasing number of punitive responses from states [toward] perinatal substance use.”
Schiff also critiqued the “stigmatizing” nature of Massachusetts’s 51A Statute — a law that mandates reporting suspected child abuse.
“It harms the health of pregnant people and their infants because we know that this mandated reporting results in people avoiding the recommended care for them and their baby,” Schiff said.
Crawford emphasized empathy when dealing with parents experiencing substance abuse.
“It was very clear to me that these parents who came into our program with substance use disorder had long trauma histories like Julie did,” she said. “ I just would always say to myself, how lucky I was, I could have very easily been in that same situation. And how would I want to be treated in that situation?”

The Harvard University Police Department is set to close its Mather House substation following years of outcry from students and faculty.
The Mather facility, which opened in 2005, is one of four HUPD substations on Harvard’s campus. Students have long complained that the outpost — the only such facility attached to an undergraduate house — is more intimidating than it is helpful.
HUPD decided last week to close the facility, according to department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
“The decision to close the Mather House substation was made last week in response to concerns raised by Mather House staff and students as well as the amount of use of the substation by officers and community members,” Catalano wrote in a statement Tuesday.
Mather resident Faith A. Woods ’24 said she did not feel safe having the substation attached to her house.
“I am well aware that the police are not there to keep me actively safe,” Woods said last week, before the department said it would close the facility. “Having a police car sitting outside of Mather every night — which it does — doesn’t bring me any sense of safety.
“Instead,” she said, “it implies that we’re being watched and policed, which is not a pleasant feeling.”
Eleanor M. Taylor ’22, a Mather resident, said the substation does not fulfill a purpose other than eliciting fear, pointing to the office’s small size.
“The real effect that the presence of the HUPD substation has on the Mather community is simply a violent, visual intimidation tactic that students are forced to see every time they enter the house,” she said.
Taylor said she reached out to Mather’s faculty deans about concerns that armed HUPD officers regularly ate in the dining hall alongside students during the 2019-2020 academic year, which she said made many residents feel uncomfortable.
Mather House’s faculty deans, Amala Mahadevan and L. “Maha” Mahadevan, wrote in an email to The Crimson last week that they raised concerns about the substation with HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay in fall 2021, soon after he took over as the department’s head.
The deans wrote that Clay’s appointment as HUPD chief provided an opportunity to bring up student concerns about the department, including the Mather substation.
Since campus reopened last fall, armed officers have not been permitted to eat in upperclassman dining halls, according to the faculty deans.
Taylor said the new dining hall rule represents “forward progress,” but criticized the slow pace of reform and a lack of transparency in the department’s decision-making process.
While the Mather facility is set to close, HUPD continues to operate substations at the University’s Longwood Campus, the Smith Campus Center, and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Wexner Building.
“The closure will not impact the Department’s ability to respond to calls from the community in an effective and timely manner,” Catalano wrote.
According to the department’s website, the substations are part of a broader focus on “community-oriented problem solving,” aimed at building trust between the department and Harvard affiliates through increased communication and interaction.
But an external review into HUPD conducted in 2020 recommended that the department reevaluate its current approach to “community policing,” noting that many students and faculty saw the HUPD’s outreach efforts as “superficial and perfunctory.” The University has since pursued several recommendations from the report, including the formation of an advisory board composed of Harvard affiliates.
Mather House resident Kai D. DeJesus ’24 said HUPD’s decision to close the substation is a “really good first step” but added that more work needs to be done to address students’ concerns. DeJesus pointed to a 2020 incident in which an HUPD officer was accused of using excessive force while arresting a Black man in Harvard’s Smith Campus Center.
“It’s really important that we keep these violent institutions outside of residences,” DeJesus said. “Ultimately, HUPD remains the police force that disproportionately targets Black and Brown people here on campus and in Cambridge.”
“For real justice to exist on this campus, HUPD must be abolished,” DeJesus added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The return to in-person activities has drawn mixed reviews from Harvard club athletes, who report facing new team dynamics created by the pandemic and related safety protocols.
Club sports returned in fall 2021 as campus came back to life for the first time in nearly two years. But club athletes were greeted with markedly different Covid-19 policies than varsity competitors, who are not required to wear masks while competing.
Morgan K. Sokol ’24, a women’s club soccer captain, said there have been no major Covid-19 outbreaks this year, even as the team has traveled across the country for games.
“We didn’t really have any Covid issues in the fall, which was great,” Sokol said, adding that players were required to take tests before and after competing at away games.
Cynthia Chen ’24, who joined the women’s club volleyball team this year, said an influx of new members following the virtual year helped her to feel more welcomed to the squad.
“A lot of us are new and there were not too many returning players, so I definitely think that it was an interesting opportunity to bond with everyone,” Chen said. “I honestly really liked the fact that there were so many new players on the team because [it] created a really welcoming environment.”
But Matthew Z. Mu ’22 and Maia J. Alberts ’23, the club swim team captains, said team bonding amid Covid-19 protocols has proven to be difficult.
“One of the biggest things that we love about club swim is that it’s so community-oriented and really inclusive,” Alberts said. “But it’s just harder during Covid, because what can we do to keep socials safe, keep our community safe at the same time?”
“There’s definitely a challenge of us knowing what old club swim traditions were prior to Covid and figuring out ways to adapt them to make them Covid safe and in line with the Harvard Club Sports policies, and still keep that essence of what the club sport is,” Mu added.
Mu and Alberts said club swim practices prior to Covid-19 were open to all members. But now, the group requires signups to meet Harvard’s pandemic-era pool capacity limits — two people per lane — and make sure members get equal opportunities to pool space and time.
Jaylen C. Wang ’22, captain of the men’s club tennis team, said scheduling practice spaces has been difficult because of a surge in interest after the return to in-person activities.
“There have been people who haven’t played in a while and got back onto campus and saw the opportunity and so I think even from that we’ve had a lot of demand,” Wang said. “Just from scheduling courts, it’s been a little difficult because the amount of people we’ve had coming out to practice. But that’s kind of a good problem to have.”
Still, Wang said that club tennis “feels really normal right now,” with consistent practices back in place and high underclassmen engagement.
Nia S. Warren ’24, a captain of the club dance team, said Covid-19 policies required the group to abide by club athletic rules for practices but follow different requirements when performing at varsity games.
At the beginning of the semester, as Covid-19 cases were surging due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant, club sports weren’t allowed to practice, Warren said — but the club dance team was still expected to perform at some varsity contests.
“We could go and support athletics — which like we like to do, it’s great — but we just didn’t get to practice before,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed three bills at its second meeting of the year on Tuesday after it failed to meet quorum when debate on legislation began an hour and a half after roll call, causing a delay.
Only 34 representatives attended the meeting — some for just a portion — with the assembly barely squeezing past its 28-member quorum at points. The two-hour-long meeting had six pieces of legislation on the agenda, including club grants, procedural reform, and financial support for transgender students.
Also on the docket was a bill to officially return the Council’s weekly meetings to Sunday after they had been moved to Tuesday by UC President Michael Y. Cheng ’22. Cheng claims the move was made to accommodate a faculty mediator but has received extensive criticism from UC members who said the new time presented a logistical challenge.
At the outset of the meeting, Cheng announced that he would shift the schedule back to the regular Sunday time.
The meeting began with an address from the mediator, Assistant Dean of Student Engagement Kate T. Colleran. Colleran reiterated her role in the debate and implored council members to make use of parliamentary procedure.
Lowell House Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24 then took to the floor to provide an update on the Citizens’ Assembly. The assembly, proposed by Cheng during his presidential campaign, is tasked with drafting a constitution to fundamentally restructure the student government — a prospect that has been met with skepticism by some UC members. The body, which is composed of randomly selected students and UC members, began meeting earlier this year.
After the presentation, Cheng and Estabine, a member of the Citizens’ Assembly, took questions from other UC members, who expressed concern about a perceived lack of transparency in the process. Cheng said that the group convened privately to allow free discussion among members.
“We didn't want people to feel like they couldn't express a view that might be offensive — that might be unpopular — and then get called out for that,” Cheng said.
“They are planning to start hosting public events very soon, really in the next few weeks,” Estabine added.
The council also briefly discussed the status of their efforts to preserve Shopping Week, but as debate stretched on, some members of the Council became anxious that other businesses would not have time to be considered.
UC Finance Committee Chair Daniella M. Berrospi urged Cheng to begin deliberation on a bill to fund club grants but was informed that quorum had not yet been reached.
After additional UC members joined the meeting via Zoom, the Council reached quorum and passed three pieces of legislation, including two grant funding bills totaling $10,339.83.
Corrections: February 23, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Undergraduate Council passed just two bills at its Tuesday meeting. In fact, it passed three pieces of legislation.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Undergraduate Council failed to reach a quorum until an hour and a half into its Tuesday meeting. In fact, it failed to maintain a quorum throughout the meeting after initially starting with one, subsequently falling below the threshold, and then regaining a quorum when members rejoined.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated 29 Undergraduate Council members attended Tuesday’s meeting. In fact, 34 members attended the meeting, including five who were only present for portions of the assembly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a dominant performance on Saturday night at Blodgett Pool, Harvard Women’s Swimming and Diving capped off a victorious season with a win at the 2022 Ivy League Championships.
After leading the points total for all four days of the competition, Harvard finished the meet atop the points board to reclaim the Frank Keefe trophy. This achievement is the Crimson’s 15th title in program history and eighth title under Stephanie Wriede Morawski '92, The Costin Family Head Coach for Harvard Women's Swimming & Diving.
After finishing the home and away season with back-to-back losses against rivals Yale and Princeton, the Crimson bounced back with a powerful performance on a bigger stage The team finished with 1,503.5 points, beating second-place Yale (1,258), third-place Penn (1,256), as well as the five other Ivy schools.
Day 1 saw Harvard capture the 800 free relay, the night’s second and final event.. Harvard's relay team of senior Felicia Pasadyn, junior Samantha Shelton, sophomore Addie Rose Bullock, and first-year Molly Hamlin took the 800 free relay with a time of 7:06.66, marking the Crimson's fastest time in the event this season.
On Day 2, Samantha Shelton kept up momentum and won the 200 IM in 1:58.03, edging out teammate Pasadyn (1:58.25) for her second career title in that event. The Crimson then swept the top four spots in 1-meter diving, led by first-year standout Katie Laverty, who posted an impressive score of 288.15.
Day 3 saw Felicia Pasadyn bounce back from her second place finish on Thursday with a win in the 400 IM, this time beating fellow senior Mikki Thompson for an NCAA B cut time of 4:10.45. First-year Aleksandra Denisenko put her first mark on the competition, winning the 100-yard breaststroke with another NCAA B cut time of 1:00.96.
Harvard stormed home on the final day of the competition, with four event wins to cap off a successful championship. Sophomore star Elizabeth Miclau won the 3-meter diving event, first-year Abby Carr claimed the 200-meter butterfly, while Pasadyn and Denisenko both won on back-to-back days in the 200 backstroke and 200 breaststroke, respectively.
Senior Georgina Milne won the Ron Keenhold Career High Point Diver Award for cumulative points over four years, while Katie Laverty captured the Rick Gilbert Award as the High Point Diver of the meet. Eight Crimson student-athletes combined for NCAA B cut times in 14 events over the course of the four days.
After finishing the season 6-2, it took a comprehensive team effort across multiple disciplines to rise atop the Ivy League in 2022. Harvard won a total of nine individual events, four of which were won by first-year athletes - a testament to the depth of the team and an exciting sign for the future of the program.
Harvard will look to send representatives to the NCAA Zone Diving Championships (Mar. 7-9) and NCAA Championships (Mar. 17-19) in Atlanta, Georgia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard women’s basketball (12-12, 6-6) continued down the home stretch of its regular season this past weekend, a pair of road matchups with the Columbia Lions (19-4, 10-1) and Cornell Big Red (9-13, 4-7) presented key opportunities for the Crimson to solidify its spot in the Ivy League women’s basketball tournament in March. On Friday night, Harvard traded baskets in a competitive, high-scoring affair with Columbia before losing, 74-70. The Crimson was then unable to repeat its 42-point victory over Cornell on January 22, falling to the Big Red on Saturday night, 52-49.
HARVARD 70, COLUMBIA 74
The Crimson took the floor Friday night without two of its starting players, junior guard McKenzie Forbes and senior guard Tess Sussman. The combination of missing Sussman’s leadership and versatility on both ends of the floor and Forbes’ scoring prowess–which was on full display in her 30-point outburst in last Saturday’s game against Penn–posed a stiff challenge to a young Harvard team facing Ivy League second-place Columbia.
Not having Forbes and Sussman, however, provided opportunities for Harvard junior guard Annie Stritzel, first-year guard Elena Rodriguez, and others to step into increased roles against the Lions. Typically Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s first substitute off the bench this season, Stritzel delivered a strong performance Friday night as a starter, shooting six-of-ten from the field for 17 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists. Rodriguez, who has shown flashes of stellar play in her first college season, logged 27 minutes as a starter and finished with seven points and four rebounds. Fellow first-year guard Elle Stauffer also recorded a career-high in minutes (20) and tied her career-high in points (9) for the Crimson.
“[Rodriguez, Stritzel, and Stauffer] primarily did [step-up], and I thought they did a great job last night,” said Delaney-Smith. “We just fell short at the end. I would say we're in a position to win last night despite missing two starters, and I was pretty proud of how everyone stepped up last night and I really liked our defensive effort. We missed some key rebounds at the end of the game that took us out of his ability to be able to win. But again, proud of how we stepped up.”
Harvard’s star first-year guard Harmoni Turner picked right back up from her 23-point showing last weekend with the Crimson’s first bucket of the game on Friday. After trading baskets through the first eight minutes, Rodriguez finished an and-one layup to trigger an eight-to-two run that earned Harvard a 19-18 lead entering the second quarter.
The Crimson finished the game with 14 steals, and this defensive intensity was on full display before halftime. Three consecutive Columbia possessions ended in turnovers for Harvard with two minutes remaining in the half, including two steals from Stritzel that she turned into transition scores. After Columbia’s sophomore guard Abbey Hsu knocked down a three-pointer at the buzzer to put the Lions up 35-31 at halftime, a seven-to-nothing Crimson run at the start of the third quarter narrowed its deficit to one, 41-40. Delaney-Smith described the message to her team at halftime that helped produce the scoring burst.
“I think [our halftime messages] are usually very similar. [...] We just try to tweak what offenses we're running and pay attention to who's hot from the other team and talk a little bit about our rebounding efforts, because we're so undersized against everyone. Columbia had two pretty athletic, tall players that played the forward spots in both the four and the five. I think [one player was] 6’1”, but they do play taller than that because they're extremely athletic and big. We're stretched because we're undersized.”
Turner, who led Harvard with 20 points on the night, unleashed her ability as a facilitator throughout the third quarter with a pair of assists to Stritzel and Rodriguez, and her floater with two minutes left in the period tied the score at 50.
The Crimson kept up defensive intensity in the game’s final stretch, but poor shooting (6-of-22 from the field and one-for-five from the three-point line) allowed Columbia to slowly stretch its lead to 68-59 with three minutes left to play. The Lions would hold onto their lead, winning 74-70 and solidifying their second-place position in the Ivy League conference standings.
HARVARD 49, CORNELL 52
After a four-hour bus ride that got into Ithaca at 3:00 a.m. on Saturday, Harvard took the floor against Cornell for their second game of the back-to-back. The game appeared to be a good opportunity for the Crimson to rediscover their winning ways; when the two teams met last month in Cambridge, Harvard came away with a 42-point victory.
But this time around, as the seconds ran out in the third quarter, Cornell found itself up two and with the ball under their own basket. Handed the ball for the inbounds play, Big Red guard Shannon Mulroy noticed Harvard’s Lindsay Lawson with her back to the basket. Mulroy quickly passed the ball off Lawson’s legs, collected the ricochet, and went up for a layup. After getting fouled on the shot, Mulroy buried two free throws to put her team up 38-34 heading into the final ten minutes.
The play seemed to be a microcosm of the night. Cornell met a shorthanded and weary Crimson team and caught them off guard, sending Harvard home from their road trip with a bitter loss. After the game, Harvard’s bewilderment was evident. “I don’t know what happened tonight,” said Coach Delaney-Smith. “We looked like we were a second behind in everything we did, and honestly, we didn't deserve to win.”
Just one day removed from losing to a two-win Dartmouth team, Cornell was aggressive from the start of the contest, keeping Harvard off-balance on both ends of the floor and outrebounding the Crimson 16-7 in the first quarter. While the last matchup between the two teams saw Harvard score the game’s first 22 points, this time around, the Big Red led 14-10 after ten minutes.
The Crimson shut down the Big Red in the second quarter, holding the hosts to four points. But the shorthanded visitors failed to capitalize, shooting just 5-16 from the floor to go into the break up by four. After halftime, Harvard quickly reached their biggest lead of the night at 28-21. After that point, however, Delaney-Smith’s team shot 2-14 from the field over the next seven minutes and watched their lead dwindle and disappear.
In the fourth quarter, Harvard tried to find the late run that has saved them numerous times this season. But Cornell managed to keep the visitors just out of reach, always staying one or two possessions ahead of the Crimson. With under two minutes left in the game, Harvard showed some life. Guard Lola Mullaney knocked down a deep three to make the score 48-50. The Crimson then executed a full court press to perfection, resulting in a Turner steal. But over the next minute and a half, Harvard was unable to convert multiple chances. After Turner had her last-second desperation heave blocked, Cornell rushed to center court to celebrate knocking off the Crimson for only the 14th time in the two teams’ 86-game history.
It was a game where Harvard’s lack of leadership and steady play in the form of Forbes and Sussman was glaring. Only four players scored a point for the Crimson, and the offense struggled to find a rhythm all game. Delaney-Smith noted that without Forbes, Cornell was able to pressure Harvard’s other primary shot creators into more difficult shots. “Our shooting percentages were down, though, for both Lola [Mullaney] and Harmoni [Turner],” Delaney-Smith said. “Defenses can zone in on them, so you look for some other people to put the ball in the basket. And no one's consistently showing that kind of confidence right now, unfortunately.”
After a five-game winning streak, the Crimson are now in the midst of a three-game skid as they look to lock up an Ivy League tournament spot in the season’s last two games. In each of the last three contests, Harvard had chances to win. But instead of sitting at 9-3 in league play, comfortably ahead of Yale in the standings, the Crimson are 6-6, with a shrinking path to the third seed. They now sit just half a game ahead of Penn, but they still control their own destiny, and have a chance to right the ship by giving Princeton their first Ivy League loss next Saturday at Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 6/6 Harvard women’s hockey team has already raked in hardware this season, including the Ivy League championship and Beanpot title, but it entered its two final games hoping to add another to the trophy room — the ECAC regular season championship.
However, it would need a little bit of help. Since No. 7/7 Yale (22-6-1, 16-5-1 ECAC) was two points ahead of the Crimson, Harvard would need to win out and hope that Yale would falter against one of its last two opponents. After defeating Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (9-23, 5-17 ECAC), 4-1 on Friday, the Crimson got what they needed, as the Bulldogs fell to Quinnipiac 4-1. As Harvard prepared for a Feb. 19 battle at Union, it knew that a victory would guarantee it the ECAC title. For the Crimson, it marked the culmination of a two-year journey after the 2020-21 season was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The year off has been a factor in not taking any game for granted,” senior forward Becca Gilmore said. “It is something that is in our hearts everytime we step on the ice.”
Harvard would go on to claim a 3-0 win over the Dutchwomen (5-28-1, 2-20 ECAC), capturing the eighth ECAC regular season title in school history and the first since 2015.
Entering the weekend slate, the Crimson had played seven games within the span of 14 days. Although this span included the Beanpot title, it ended with a loss to No. 9/9 Quinnipiac (23-8-3, 15-7 ECAC) and a tie with St. Lawrence (14-13-7, 10-8-4 ECAC). Due to this, Harvard head coach Katey Stone emphasized mixing on-ice results with off-ice recovery while preparing for the road trip to Upstate New York.
“We played a ton of hockey games in a two-and-a-half week stretch, so making sure we got the proper amount of rest to fill our tanks again was the focus,” she said.
HARVARD 3, UNION 0
Knowing that a win would guarantee it the ECAC regular season crown, the Crimson traveled to Schenectady, N.Y., to do battle with Union.
“You don't have to say too much in those situations. Our kids know what’s at stake and what they’re playing for,” Stone said.
Harvard would not be able to jump out to an early lead, as Dutchwomen goalie Sophie Matsoukas blocked every shot to amass 17 first period saves. Union would also fail to generate offense despite a first period power play chance.
Twelve minutes into the second, junior forward Kristin Della Rovere broke the tie with a power play goal that was assisted on by first-year forward Taze Thompson and junior defender Kyra Willoughby. However, this would be the only goal the Crimson would score in the second period, failing to convert on a power play shortly before intermission.
Ultimately, Harvard’s title chase would not be denied, as it found its championship-winning goal with five minutes left in the third, when senior defender Emma Buckles found the back of the cage following passes from Hyland and senior forward Dominique Petrie. After assisting on the previous goal, Petrie salted the game away with an empty net goal in the final seconds.
HARVARD 4, RPI 1
In the first game of the road trip, the Crimson traveled to Troy, N.Y. to take on RPI. In her first game back after a three-game absence, sophomore forward Shannon Hollands scored the opening goal. The goal came six minutes into the game, as a near-post wrist shot slipped past Engineers goalie Amanda Rampado. Later in the first period, Harvard got another opportunity to score, as RPI’s Delaney Weiss was assessed two minutes for hooking. The Crimson seized the opportunity, as Gilmore found the back of the net only a few seconds into the power play.
One minute into the second period, Harvard went on the power play again when the Engineers’ Riena Jahnke was called for a two-minute minor penalty. This time, the Crimson failed to convert, as shots by junior forward Anne Bloomer and Willoughby were all saved by Rampado. Harvard was not to be denied for long, though; halfway through the period, sophomore forward Courtney Hyland extended the lead to three off of a nice dish by Thompson. Later in the second, after RPI was given two minutes for roughing, the Crimson scored their second power-play goal of the night, as Thompson netted her eighth goal of the season.
Although the Engineers entered the game with an ECAC-best 91.3% penalty kill rate, Harvard managed to add two power play goals to its total, its 26th and 27th, good for fourth-best in the NCAA.
“The difference was our shot selection and our net front presence screening the goaltender, '' Stone said.
Asia Taylor-Walters got RPI on the board early in the third. However, the goal would not be enough to spark a comeback, as Harvard held on for the 4-1 victory.
The Crimson will return to action on Feb. 22 in the ECAC quarterfinals. They will play host to the Princeton Tigers (11-13-5, 9-10-3 ECAC) at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The game is the first of a best-of-three series to determine who advances to the ECAC semifinals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We knew we were the one seed, we knew we had a target on our back,” junior Harris Walker said. “So it was all about staying disciplined, going out there and taking care of business, doing nothing fancy.”
There were two main themes of this past weekend for No. 16 Harvard Men’s Tennis as it secured the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Championship: composure and execution. The Crimson men competed for a grueling three-day stretch against their Ivy League counterparts in the first major team tournament of the spring season as they took on Brown, Princeton, and Columbia on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, respectively. With high hopes as the top seed in the tournament and the memory of losing in the ECAC final two years ago still fresh on their minds, the Harvard men came through with stellar performances across the board to take home its first team hardware of the season.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 0
The Crimson came out firing on all cylinders in its opening match against Brown. In doubles play, first-year Daniel Milavsky and senior Brian Shi defeated a duo from Brown in a quick 6-2 performance, followed by Walker and sophomore Ronan Jachuck securing the doubles point with a 6-4 victory of their own.
“[Jachuck] and I have played every match together, and we keep getting better,” said Walker about the doubles performance. “We had a couple of tough losses at the beginning, but we’ve found our groove, our chemistry has gotten much, much better, and we’ve been focusing on honing the patterns that we really like. It’s all about looking to find a volley after our serve, and if we’re returning on big points, it’s about attacking.”
In singles play, Harvard found its rhythm, with Jachuck and Milavsky making quick work of their opponents in straight sets, 6-2, 6-0 and 6-1, 6-2, respectively. Walker remained on the court after those two singles games wrapped up, putting the Crimson on the brink of a day one victory up 3-0. With an impressive first set performance score of 6-1, Walker followed up with even more dominance to secure the team victory in the second set by a 6-1 margin.
“Slowly but surely the pressure mounted and I ended up running away with it, which felt good to get it done quickly when you’re going into the rest of the weekend knowing it’ll only get tougher,” Walker said.
HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 0
On the second day of the tournament, Harvard knew it was going to face a tougher test against the Tigers. The Crimson, however, stepped up to the challenge and executed their plan perfectly en route to a 4-0 victory to move onto the final round of the tournament.
Walker noted that while the team got off to a rocky start in competitions this year, it was this performance that highlighted just how far the team had come in building chemistry and gaining momentum.
“Now everyone’s together and we’re starting to fire on all cylinders,” Walker said. “It’s exciting.”
Building on momentum from the first match, Walker and Jachuck helped take the doubles point from Princeton 6-4, while the duo of sophomore Henry Von Der Schulenburg and junior Steven Sun brought it home with a 7-5 victory.
Harvard then proceeded to win on the first and sixth courts in singles play, again leaving Walker to finish the job and secure the team victory. After two straight positive sets with a 6-4 margin, the junior advanced the Crimson to the next round for the second day in a row.
“It was great to clinch [the match against Princeton], and I know if I hadn’t, it would’ve been a very, very tight match,” Walker said. “Even though [we won] 4-0, it was much closer than the score indicates.”
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 2
The final match of the tournament told a bit of a different story: for the first time all weekend, the Harvard men were backed against the wall.
In doubles play, Von Der Schulenberg and Sun gained an early lead on the third court with a dominant 6-3 win, but the other two Crimson duos lost, resulting in Columbia taking the doubles point.
“We were all really looking forward to the match against Columbia, and I think that actually worked a little bit against me, specifically,” Jachuck said. “I was playing a little bit tight, you know, I wasn’t really playing my game.”
In singles play, Harvard got back on track, as Walker and Milavsky were able to each take down their opponents by scores of 6-1, 6-3 and 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, respectively. On the third court, Shi battled closely against Columbia’s Max Westphal, going to the wire in the first set with a 7-6(3) performance. Shi followed this clutch performance with an identical 7-6(3) second set, putting the Crimson up 3-2 in the match and on the brink of victory and an ECAC Championship. This left Jachuck to seal the deal.
“It got interesting because the matches next to me finished, and as matches started to come down I knew the score was getting close, but I had no idea how close we were to clinching the match,” Jachuck said. “I was pretty in the zone, focusing on myself, not worrying what was going on the other side or on the other courts.”
Jachuck dropped the first set 5-7, but then came back to take the second set 6-3. And if it hadn’t completely come together before, it was in this moment –in this last set, on the brink of a tournament victory –that the team realized its goals for the season were starting to come to fruition.
“[Jachuck] has always been composed, and he’s a great example of someone who regardless of the ups and downs stays level-headed,” Walker said. “We’ve all believed in him, I’ve believed in him. Even a set down, I knew he was going to come back. He deserves it more than anyone.”
Up 5-4 in the set, Jachuck stepped back to serve, stepped up for his opponent’s return just to see the ball hit right back into the net, ending the match and securing the ECAC Championship. Jachuck’s teammates immediately rushed the court to congratulate him and celebrate the win.
“I didn’t realize we won until all my teammates rushed the court and bulldozed me,” Jachuck said.
Harvard went into this spring season with lofty goals, a top 25 national ranking and a hunger to prove themselves worthy of national recognition after a year of no competition. And with this victory, dreams of an Ivy League Title and a run in the NCAA tournament feel a bit closer to reality.
“I really don’t think there are ten teams in college tennis that can beat us,” Walker said. “To have a banner that says we went far in the NCAA tournament, that’s something that lasts forever.”
Next up for the Crimson are two home matches against Vanderbilt and Northwestern this weekend.

It seems all too convenient that there are just as many houses as there are zodiac signs, especially because they’re both admittedly random categories that still somehow have unique vibes. We’re not sure if people will be more upset at the zodiac sign their house is assigned, or the house that their sign is associated with. But what are we here for if not to sow Housing Day discord? So, without further ado…
River West: Fire Signs
Who but River West can house the passionate energy that fire signs spend so much time trying to pass off as “leadership skills” rather than “too much for section” and “really loud at 7 a.m.”?
Kirkland: Aries
Both Aries and Kirkland will get really mad if you forget about them, so they get to be first. Only the impulsive Aries can handle a new week every week. And rams and boars are basically the same thing if you ignore everything but the horns.
Eliot: Leo
Dominant, creative, bougie: traits of Eliot, and also traits of Leos. A Leo is the perfect person to actually enjoy Fête without getting embarrassed by the sheer opulence of the ice sculptures. Also: E-LEO-t. Enough said.
Winthrop: Sagittarius
With all its common spaces recently renovated to perfection, Winthrop is the perfect house for Sagittariuses to gather and use their famed open-heartedness to gossip about how every other house sucks at IMs. They’ll also use their boundless cleverness to point out that we should have put Leo and Winthrop together because they’re both lions, to which we say, use some of that creativity to open your mind.
River East: Water Signs
Besides the obvious river/water comparison, these two groups have the same creative, friendly but mysterious vibe… what is even going on over there? Are their smiles just a facade? Are they okay?
Dunster: Cancer
Cancers can say they never leave Dunster because of its ~pristine facilities~, not because they’re scared of other people. And they can use the courtyard to gaze at the river, thinking about their feelings…
Mather: Scorpio
Introverted Scorpios will rejoice in the guaranteed singles that Mather promises them. Then they can literally judge the rest of us from above in their ivory concrete tower.
Leverett: Pisces
The biggest house is the perfect support system for the hyper-sympathetic Pisces. So many people to care too much about! So many nooks and crannies where they can space out for hours uninterrupted!
The Square: Air Signs
The intelligent, unemotional air signs don’t need river views or quiet streets to be happy. All they need is convenience. And that’s what the Square provides.
Adams: Aquarius
*Quirky* Aquarians will meet Adams’ artsy, lowkey, our-tunnels-are-cooler-than-yours vibe. “Drag Night is my favorite holiday. Also I wake up at 8:57 for my 9 a.m. classes.” — An Aquarius, probably.
Lowell: Libra
Lowell and Libras are both all about balance. They can have a squash court AND a maker space. A newly renovated building AND super nice overflow housing. TWO courtyards. Why choose?
Quincy: Gemini
As “The People’s House,” Quincy has to be as flexible and outgoing as a Gemini when every other house comes crawling for a hot breakfast. Just think of Stone Hall and New Quincy as its two faces.
The Quad: Earth Signs
Earth signs are loyal and down-to-earth, and if you’re placed in the Quad, you better learn to be those things too. Gotta stay grounded to escape the nine diss tracks that come your way each March.
Currier: Taurus
Currierites and Taureans are both stubborn — they will defend the Quad to the grave. But, they’re also dependable, just like the S-tier food at their dhall. And the constant Treehouse and Ten-Man parties will fulfill their *need for social stability* by making the instability extremely stable.
Cabot: Virgo
Perfectionist yet practical Virgos will not be disappointed in Cabot House, which is a first because Virgos are disappointed in everything. The rooms are big enough for obsessive pacing, and when they want to micromanage House Events, they can simply apply for a grant to fund them.
Pforzheimer: Capricorn
Capfricorns (pretend that works) like to keep a tight-knit circle, and Pfoho’s unrelenting house pride will match their energy! They’ll enjoy the impromptu communal study sessions in the dhall every night almost as much as they’ll like speed-walking to and from the Quad, just to prove that they can.
Basically, we’re not saying that the stars can tell you what house you’ll be placed in on that fateful day, but we’re not not saying that. Check your sun, moon, and rising, then pray to the Housing Gods
