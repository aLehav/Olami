After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two of Harvard’s most prominent interdisciplinary scholars have been named University Professors—an honor that gives them the opportunity to teach in any Harvard school.
University President Drew G. Faust has appointed Government professor Gary King, a quantitative social science expert, Harvard’s second Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professor, replacing the late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. Medical School professor Marc W. Kirschner has become the third John Franklin Enders University Professor—a post named for the Harvard researcher who played a crucial role in developing the polio vaccine.
King and Kirschner, who will be joining Harvard’s 20 other University professors in the prestigious post, have emphasized interdisciplinary developments in the social sciences and biology, respectively.
“In the past, there were always physicists and mathematicians who came into biology…. But they essentially had to abandon their previous fields completely,” Kirschner said. “Now, there are many important questions in biology that require very specific quantitative and mathematical training.”
Kirschner has cultivated an interdisciplinary community at Harvard in systems biology—a field that brings together biology with engineering, mathematics, computer science, and physics. Kirschner compares systems biology to engineering: “When we ask how an airplane can fly stably in all different kinds of conditions, we are close to the kind of question of how the human body in various environments can also avoid crashing.”
Kirschner founded the Medical School’s Systems Biology department six years ago, and still serves as its chair. Kirschner also helped develop a systems biology committee in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and a University-wide master’s program in systems biology.
But when Faust called Kirschner’s office several times on July 15 and left a voicemail asking him to call her back, Kirschner said he looked at the caller ID with the apprehension of someone being called to the principal’s office.
“I couldn’t figure out why she was calling me, and I couldn’t think of any bad reasons,” he said. “I figured I have tenure; they can’t really fire me.”
King—both a statistician and social scientist—has developed an interdisciplinary research community of his own: he helped found the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and is currently serving as its director.
King said that the social sciences are undergoing a historic transformation in response to the computer revolution. Out of necessity, he said, the field is becoming a “team sport” led by “collaborative interdisciplinary teams” akin to labs in the natural sciences. “There isn’t any other way to cope with the onslaught of data of different types and ever increasing quantities,” he said.
“Where at one time social scientists worked by themselves in their offices thinking great thoughts, we are now getting to the point where many more of these thoughts are associated with hard empirical evidence,” King added.
King’s colleagues said that this new numbers-based trend creates a need for interdisciplinary scholars. 
“He is probably a triple-threat professor,” political scientist and former University Professor Sidney Verba said of King. “He believes in the social sciences deeply, and his goal, I think, is to try to make it as scientific as possible.”
But King is not solely focused on the social sciences’ quantitative side, said Government Professor Kenneth A. Shepsle. “He’s actually interested in getting young scholars to take whatever evidence they have in whatever form it comes in—whether qualitative or quantitative—and simply be systematic about it,” Shepsle said.
Now that King and Kirshner are allowed to freely teach across Harvard’s schools, King said he’d like to teach in the School of Public Health, and Kirschner said that he’d be interested in teaching an FAS seminar on evolutionary biology, based on an FAS seminar he co-taught a decade ago.
As for other perks, Verba said that University Professors receive higher compensation than most other faculty members. But the professors and administrators contacted for this article declined to comment on how much University Professors are generally paid. “It’s considered bad taste,” Verba said of discussing faculty salaries.
While King said he’s received a number of congratulatory e-mails asking whether his professorship allows him to graze a cow in Harvard Yard, the description of the Albert J. Weatherhead III University Professorship makes no mention of cows.
“There’s no real special perk except it looks good after your name,” Verba said of University Professorships. “The problem with professors is what we live on is prestige.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prosecutors revealed Monday which of three suspects arrested in recent months they believe pulled the trigger in a fatal Kirkland House shooting in May.
According to the Boston Globe, Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Daniel Bennett alleged that Jabrai J. Copney, 20, shot Cambridge resident Justin Cosby, leaving the 21-year-old dead just hours later. The news came at the arraignment Monday morning of Jason Aquino, 23, another of the three suspects.
Copney pleaded not guilty to all five of the prosecutor's charges, including first degree murder, at his arraignment in Middlesex Superior Court on July 22.
Bennett said that Copney, Aquino, and Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts, 19, arrived at Harvard from New York on May 18. Armed with a 9 mm handgun, they met Cosby in Kirkland’s basement to steal $1,000 in drug money. Jiggetts then handed the gun to Copney, who shot Cosby after a struggle, Bennett said.
After Cosby was shot, the three suspects fled to Lowell House—the residence of Brittany J. Smith ’09, who was dating Copney—to hide the gun. Meanwhile, Cosby had stumbled out of Kirkland and collapsed onto Dunster Street. The three then escaped to South Station, where they took a bus back to New York City, Bennett said.

The third suspect arrested in connection with the fatal May shooting in Kirkland House pleaded not guilty Monday to first degree murder and three other charges.
Jason Aquino, 23, who was arrested at his home in Harlem on Thursday, was charged with first degree murder, accessory after the fact of murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm in Cambridge District Court. Judge Roann Sragow-Licht ordered Aquino to be held in jail without bail.
Aquino’s next appearance at court—a probable cause hearing—will take place at the Cambridge District Court on Sept. 3, according to Corey Welford, a spokesman for the Middlesex District Attorney’s office. Boston attorney Matthew A. Kamholtz will represent Aquino and was present at the arraignment on his behalf.
Aquino was arraigned in the Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday afternoon on a fugitive affidavit—wearing the same white-and-blue-striped shirt that he wore at today’s hearing—and agreed to be extradited to Massachusetts.
The second suspect in the shooting to be detained by police, Blayn Jiggetts, 19, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., was arrested in Harlem on June 9, but has refused to return voluntarily to Massachusetts to face charges. He is being jailed without bail in New York. Prosecutors are seeking a governor’s warrant—which requires the signatures of both the Massachusetts and New York governors—to extradite Jiggetts to Massachusetts to face charges at the Middlesex Superior Court. Jiggetts is scheduled to appear at an arraignment at the Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday.

He’s back. After a two-season absence, Bobby Jay has renewed his assistant coaching position with the Harvard men’s hockey team. Jay’s return not only brings a familiar face back to Bright, but his homecoming may also restore the Crimson to its glory days.
“We are very exited to have Bobby Jay back,” incoming captain Alex Biega wrote in an email. “He is an unbelievable teacher who has experience both in the collegiate and pro game...He knows what it takes to win and knows how to develop players to their full potential.”
Jay first assisted under head coach Ted Donato ’91 from 2004-2007. During this time, Jay worked closely with the Crimson’s special teams unit. Under his leadership, Harvard’s power play was among the nation’s best, with the 2005-06 and 2006-07 squads killing penalties at 85.2 percent and 80.8 percent, respectively.
“Bobby Jay has a large influence on special teams because he reminds players of the dedication and commitment to special teams that is needed for a team to have success,” former co-captain Jimmy Fraser ’09 wrote in an email. “His knowledge of the game was his main contributor to the penalty kill.”
“When he pulls you aside to tell you something, you listen carefully and do it,” Biega added. “He simplified my game dramatically, and I felt like I improved in every area in my game because of him.”
His expertise, which stems from 10 years playing professional hockey, an assistant coaching position with the Manchester Monarchs, and work as a general manager for the American Hockey League franchise in San Antonio, Texas, also helped the Crimson reach two ECAC championship games, culminating with the league title and a berth in the NCAAs in 2006.
Since Jay’s departure, Harvard has struggled to meet the same level of success. The past two seasons have featured two of the longest winless streaks in Crimson history, and although Harvard has typically been able to bounce back in the spring, its hopes of securing an ECAC title and a pass to the NCAAs have not been achieved since the 2006 championship victory.
The Crimson expects Jay’s experience and personable coaching style to provide a much-needed lift to the incoming squad.
“I think Bobby Jay will bring the feeling of success and confidence back to Harvard hockey,” Fraser wrote. “The past few years, Harvard hockey has gone through a few situations where the player's confidence and morale was down as a result of certain losing streaks. Although the previous years have demonstrated the strong level of resiliency that Harvard hockey endorses, Jay will undoubtedly help with the attitude of confidence in the locker-room.”
Jay replaces former assistant coach Sean McCann ’94, who has recently accepted a head coaching position at St. Sebastian’s School in Needham, Mass.
