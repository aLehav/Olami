After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The middle of February has brought seemingly never-ending cold, the start of midterms, and, of course, Datamatch. For those at the College who spent Valentine’s Day unattached, and even for some who did not, the 25-year-old algorithmic matchmaking program run by the Harvard Computer Society used students’ answers to a set of silly questions to “match” them with other participants for dates over sponsored free meals in Harvard Square. The program is a fun staple of our spring semesters, lying almost as close to students’ hearts as Primal Scream or Housing Day, especially given the potential for a free meal with a new potentially special someone. For all the matches, mismatches, and most importantly, for the free Zinneken’s waffles, we are happy to see Datamatch continue as a tradition — not only for Harvard students, but for those at other schools where the program has recently expanded.
Over the years, Datamatch has changed significantly, growing to include about two-thirds of students at the College, and more than a dozen colleges and universities across the country this year. We appreciate the effort and initiative that the team of students and coders at HCS have taken to spread joy to our busy campus, and are heartened by Datamatch’s success in Cambridge and California, even if not all can enjoy the benefits of free food yet. We also commend HCS for ensuring the program runs smoothly for all involved, even despite occasional hiccups like its servers crashing Thursday morning after results came out, due to overwhelming demand.
We especially love the way in which Datamatch works to build a tighter-knit campus. The matches, which connect students across Houses and years, encourage students to meet others whom they might not have met before. Whether one comes in looking for a ‘bestie’ or ‘true love,’ as the survey puts it, Datamatch encourages new connections for everyone, no matter what happens after one walks out of Zinneken's. We also appreciate the Harvard Square establishments that have partnered with HCS to ensure the program runs smoothly, and for keeping their doors open for these coveted dates. Given the overwhelming popularity of some of these locations, we would love to see the number of meal spots for oversubscribed restaurants expand in future years, given how limited they can be.
We also applaud HCS’s continued efforts toward fostering inclusivity, such adding a non-binary gender option in the survey — a move we encouraged two years ago. Changes like this one demonstrate a clear commitment on the part of Harvard students to make our school’s traditions more accessible to a broader array of students.
Though we would love to see some features from previous years brought back, such as social media connectivity and Spotify sharing to ensure we don’t run out of conversation fodder during our dates, we look forward to the tradition of Datamatch continuing for years to come — one full of laughs, awkward matches, and lots of waffles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My last column contained a disparaging reference to criticisms of course syllabi. In making it, I was referring to those student activists who disregard various Western thinkers on the grounds of their white male status; who hold the attitudes that helped overturn the core curriculum at Stanford and are currently threatening humanities courses at Columbia, Reed, and Harvey Mudd. I was not referring to those who are advocating for Harvard to create an Ethnic Studies department, nor to those who continue to press it to instate a great books-based core curriculum.
All three of these groups share the belief that the purpose of a higher education should not be purely vocational; that despite operating within a society that prioritizes personal and financial success, universities should strive to create critically thinking and culturally literate human beings. They also share the belief that an understanding of non-Western thought is integral to this project; that a Eurocentric approach to the humanities is short-sighted and close-minded.
What they do not share, however, is a view of how the status quo can be remedied. While all three see modern-day humanities departments as failing to live up to their larger function, they differ drastically in their diagnosis of how those departments can properly do so.
The first group disregards any attempt to teach the Western canon. The West was built on oppression and any attempts to instill its values are inherently oppressive. An understanding of Shakespeare, Plato, and Locke does nothing but reinforce unjust systems of power; any effort to understand the works of another region is rendered oppressive by the same systems.
The second shares a disdain of “Eurocentric course catalogues” but does not recommend tearing them up. The way forward is to create new fields of study that investigate “the nuances of ethnoracial identity and power”; to offer interested students the opportunity to challenge conventionally accepted intellectual traditions.
The third is similarly concerned about the absence of non-Western voices in university curricula but is skeptical of granting students more freedom over their course choices. Distributional requirements encourage obscure learning over intellectual discomfort; meritocracy coupled with grade inflation tempt students to take easy classes. A university should decide upon and enforce a vision for an undergraduate general education that encompasses an array of global perspectives.
Dismissing the first group is not a difficult task. Any critique of Western culture requires an understanding of Western culture. And if one believes that a white man has no place to discuss a minority perspective, by extension one believes that a minority perspective has no place outside of its minority community.
Despite clear merits, I do not consider the second group’s solution perfect either. To take the Harvard case, an ethnic studies concentration would likely be self-selecting; it would attract those who are already likely to pursue cultural literacy and leave untouched those students who could benefit from it most. Secondly, data suggests that it would be self-segregating; it would further the racial and socioeconomic divides between university departments and perpetuate the notion that non-Western cultures cannot be placed in conversation with Western ones. Finally, evidence indicates that it might sacrifice academic rigor; its self-proclaimed political status may prioritize ideological uniformity over stringent scholarship and, in doing so, further self-marginalize the study of marginalized peoples.
While I support attempts to explore how these costs could be diminished and agree that students deserve recognition for this line of study, it is naïve to think that the core problem will be solved by merely granting such recognition.
That is because the core problem is a substantial one: the absence of a rigorous, wide-ranging, required humanities curriculum in most modern-day American universities. Addressing it, as the third group desires, would be difficult but not impossible. Harvard has come close to doing so in the past, and it is high time they deemed it the project of the future. Using Columbia and the University of Chicago’s seminar models as a framework, it could institute a program that embraces real intellectual diversity.
What would such diversity look like? It’s an intimidating and exciting question. Luckily, answers are already being put forward. I am enrolled in the newly introduced course Religion 22: “Interpreting Humanity, Interpreting Religion,” which seeks to understand the important questions of humanity by reading narratives from dramatically different traditions. The class is refreshing to me because it makes a positive claim about underrepresented cultures; it does not establish itself in opposition to an understanding of Western traditions but argues for the additional wisdom present in non-Western traditions.
It is impossible to deny the need for a humanities curriculum that teaches its students to think beyond the civilization they happened to inherit; one that encourages critique, reimagines the canon, and is open to the study of all cultures on their own terms. But a recognition of what is beyond need not bring with it a renunciation of all that is within; a study of non-Western ways of thinking need not mark an end to the study of Western ones.
Ideas do not have a color, nationality, or gender; everyone from Du Bois to the Dalai Lama has recognized this fact. If we demand a core curriculum that places Confucius and Rumi alongside Plato and Arendt, we could pioneer an education that celebrates it. If we study the genius of Ibn Rushd and Gandhi in the same departments that we do Douglass and Dickens, we might realize that all of these works have more to say to our lives than we think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are the loneliest generation, and our mental health suffers accordingly.
So argues a study published last year by Cigna, a global health services provider based in Philadelphia, Pa. Cigna’s study, among other findings, suggests that 18 to 22 year olds in America are lonelier on average than even the elderly boomer population. This in part explains the recent uptick in depression rates among college students – we have less meaningful social interaction on average than our older counterparts, leading to a toll on mental health.
It is in this context of a national reckoning with mental health that Harvard attempts to support its students, members of this loneliest generation, as they navigate four years of comparatively intense academic and social pressure. And indeed, though Harvard’s practices are necessarily imperfect, they do provide a broad range of options to students suffering from mental health conditions. But in perusing options available to students, one notices that each resource requires a student seeking support to reach out in person or by phone. This creates a hole in the support network for students who don’t feel confident presenting their issues in a position of vulnerability.
Harvard’s mental health resources would do well to take a lesson from volunteer organization Samaritans, a Boston-based crisis support and suicide hotline, and make counseling services available over text message.
In 2015, after seeing a spike in suicides among young people, who are less likely to feel comfortable with phone conversations, Samaritans made their hotline accessible via text. As of 2018, their volunteers had responded to 10,000 text conversations in three years, suggesting a broad demand for the service.
Currently, Harvard’s primary source of general peer-to-peer crisis counseling is Room 13, an excellent and compassionate service staffed by two student volunteers every night from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. during the school year in the basement of Thayer Hall. Like Samaritans, Room 13 also has a phone line.
Real-time text-based counseling would be a wonderful addition to Room 13 as well as the other student peer counseling organizations. It would help reach students who are struggling deeply with mental health issues but don’t feel confident meeting a peer counselor face-to-face or talking on the phone. Furthermore, it would give students greater confidence that their anonymity is protected when they seek help. Students might feel comfortable sharing more over text than they would in person or by phone.
Well-meaning mental health agencies should realize that a face-to-face conversation with support services could be too far of a bridge for introverted students or those looking to protect their privacy. An effective text support system would guarantee confidentiality so students can be confident in the protection of their identity.
The apparent lack of an anonymous text-based support service is a gap that Harvard’s student and staff-operated mental health resources would do well to focus on. After Samaritans introduced texts to their lifeline, in a study period between Oct. 2015 and March 2016, half of texters Samaritans identified by age were found to be between the ages of 14 and 24, compared to just 9.3 percent of callers, according to statistics provided by the organization.
Furthermore, 96 percent of Samaritans texters had never called the hotline before, suggesting they were reaching a new audience with text. And the organization found that texters were ten times more likely to be at imminent risk of suicide, affirming that the added service reached those most in need.
Harvard would not be the first campus to introduce text counseling. Currently, seven schools use the text support line Lean on Me, a peer-to-peer service first launched at MIT in 2016 and inspired by Samaritans. Though Lean on Me volunteers are not crisis-trained, nor is their service designed to handle suicidal ideation, its use of text to connect students with supportive volunteers is an admirable first step.
We cannot expect Harvard to be immune from the national trends of poor mental health. But we can expect them to suit up for the challenge of fighting for the mental health of its students. Currently, our resources are deficient in at least one key resource that has proven effective in mental health at other schools. We should recognize that deficiency, and respond accordingly by providing students with a robust and trusted text counseling resource.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pointed to faculty members’ “academic freedom” in an interview Friday when asked to evaluate Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent film producer Harvey Weinstein.
“I think a faculty member is given academic freedom to make decisions that are right for them,” Khurana said. “I also think that every individual is entitled to a vigorous defense. It's a cornerstone of our justice system.”
In January, Sullivan confirmed his decision to join Weinstein’s legal team as he faces five counts of sexual assault. In the weeks since, some students have protested the decision, circulating a petition calling for Sullivan’s removal and accusing College administrators of taking insufficient action to address how his representation affects victims of sexual harassment and assault on campus.
Khurana wrote in an email last week that he has spoken to Sullivan about the “responsibilities” he holds as a faculty dean to address students’ concerns. On Friday, Khurana said he has passed along feedback from College affiliates during those conversations.
“We've been actively engaged with Professor Sullivan and so I'm actively in communication with him, specifically sharing what I'm hearing from members of the community and what they're describing their needs so that Professor Sullivan can adjust to those needs,” Khurana said.
He added that he aims to ensure that the houses — and their faculty deans — meet the needs of the student body.
“My focus is on how well the community is doing and the well-being of the community, to make sure that the goals of the house system are being met,” he said.
Khurana’s comments echo Sullivan’s own defense of his decision to represent Weinstein. In a Jan. 25 email to Winthrop residents, Sullivan wrote defendants have a right to legal representation, including those he called “unpopular.”
“It is particularly important for this category of unpopular defendant to receive the same process as everyone else – perhaps even more important,” Sullivan wrote. “To the degree we deny unpopular defendants basic due process rights we cease to be the country we imagine ourselves to be.”
In a second email to Winthrop residents, Sullivan outlined new “processes” the house will follow to respond to sexual assault and harassment, including designating Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as a “point person” for issues of sexual misconduct.
Sullivan has also received criticism for publicly defending Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., who faces three Harvard-led investigations into allegations that he sexually harassed women in the research lab he founded. In a Jan. 29 RealClearInvestigations article, Sullivan — who is described as Fryer’s lawyer in the article — called Harvard’s inquiries into the allegations against Fryer “deeply flawed and deeply unfair” and said witnesses in the investigations had been coached.
While Sullivan did not directly answer whether he represents Fryer, parties involved in Title IX proceedings are discouraged from publicly discussing them, according to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s sexual and gender-based harassment policies.
Khurana deferred a series of questions about Sullivan’s comments on Fryer to FAS administrators.
Khurana’s comments follow FAS Dean Claudine Gay’s Feb. 7 criticism of Sullivan’s response to student concerns, calling it “insufficient.”
Asked if he agreed with Gay’s criticism, Khurana answered indirectly, saying his “highest priority” is students’ confidence in the house system.
“I think all of us, as faculty deans, recognize that importance that we need to make sure that our students feel that they have a full sense of understanding of what's happening in the house, and that it's an environment that they feel that is advancing their experience at the College,” Khurana said.
In addition to supervising the College’s faculty deans, Khurana has served as the faculty dean of Cabot House alongside Stephanie R. Khurana since 2010. On Friday, he reflected on his own approach to the role when discussing Sullivan’s response.
“The faculty dean plays a critical role in the house. It is where we are really thinking about how the students' academic, social, and personal well-being come together,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As some departments belatedly come into compliance with faculty recruitment guidelines set out by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, certain faculty members are bristling at what they believe to be a reduction of their role in the process.
Though already “firmly established,” these procedures are newly salient because certain departments — including Math — have long been negligent in adhering to FAS guidelines around searches, according to FAS Dean Claudine Gay.
“Not every department has abided by those processes as faithfully as we expect them to,” said Gay. “And Math is one of those departments that has been slow in fully adopting what are standard FAS processes.”
Math Professor Wilfried Schmid publicly criticized what he viewed as administrators’ undue influence in the department’s current search at the Faculty’s meeting earlier this month.
Schmid and a colleague in the department, whose identity Schmid did not disclose, emailed Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs in December to complain that the search committee tasked with filling a tenured professorship slot maintained the power to remove candidates from consideration without the majority approval of the department.
Stubbs responded by citing the need to preserve professors’ time — which he called the faculty’s most valuable resource — and that the process aligned with that of other departments, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Crimson.
But Schmid said that process leaves the rest of the department largely “powerless,” citing one instance in which a “leading” applicant was “almost” eliminated by a search committee without majority consent. Pushback from faculty members ultimately kept the candidate in consideration.
“It came close to happening,” he said. “I cannot tell you the details, but yes, it was close to happening.”
Math Department chair Curtis T. McMullen did not dispute that the committee could winnow down a list of names without the full department’s approval, though he noted that the entire department would have the final say in whether to extend a formal offer to a candidate.
“We will not make an offer to any candidate without the approval of the department as a whole,” he wrote in an email.
Stubbs said in an interview that the administration has taken an active role in shaping the composition of faculty short lists in order to uphold institutional standards of “inclusive excellence,” especially in departments in which many of the tenured faculty members are older and less diverse, such as Math. The department hired its second-ever female senior professor last April.
“We are populating the low end of the career stage distribution with a much more diversely representative group than the upper end of the career stage,” Stubbs said. “So, as we move to populate the faculty with more junior people, there’s an approval process where our office and the Dean’s office approves the short list of candidates that are brought to campus to ensure that it’s appropriately diverse.”
At February’s faculty meeting, Schmid also cited the presence of an administrator — albeit a non-voting one — who sits in on the search committee meetings as a “violation” of faculty autonomy.
Stubbs said some faculty members’ concerns could simply amount to growing pains.
“This is the first year in which the searches that are being undertaken by the Math department are being brought into conformity with FAS expectations,” Stubbs said. “I think that the history is that the Math department appointments have been conducted in a really idiosyncratic fashion.”
“It’s not surprising that people who have experienced only one way of doing things find it disruptive and uncomfortable to do business in a different way,” Stubbs added.
Correction: Feb. 21, 2019
A previous version of this article misquoted Christopher W. Stubbs as saying "lowland." In fact, he said "low end."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Smith Campus Center has given many a new place to seek refuge from the Cambridge winter, repeated instances of homeless individuals violating the building’s no sleeping policy has prompted security guards to call Harvard police multiple times.
Harvard University Police Department officers have been dispatched to the building almost daily in recent months, often to address reports of an “unwanted guest in the area,” according to the department’s daily crime log. Sleeping in all areas of the building is prohibited, and security guards will check anyone who appears to be asleep or unconscious, according to the Building User Guide.
HUPD Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that police have intervened only in instances with non-Harvard affiliates violating campus policies and Cambridge law.
“All of the persons we have dealt with for both disorder issues and criminal behavior have been non-affiliates,” he wrote. “The majority of the behavior has been sleeping, but we have responded to disorderly behavior as well as threats and assaults and batteries.”
After two years of construction, the Smith Campus Center reopened at the start of last semester to both Harvard affiliates and the general public. The building has “Common Spaces” open to everyone, including a first floor pavilion and other attached locations, along with areas accessible only to Harvard ID holders.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke said Harvard has cultivated a positive relationship with the Cambridge community and general public.
“Harvard is proud to maintain an open campus,” she wrote. “The University welcomes thousands of visitors from both near and far to all areas of our campus daily. We are fortunate to be located in a vibrant, densely populated urban area, and are happy to share our campus with our neighbors.”
Though the policy states building staff are responsible for enforcement, Catalano said that HUPD has assigned officers to patrol the common spaces during operating hours.
“In the event that misconduct, including sleeping in the Common Spaces, or criminal activity is reported to the HUPD, officers will respond to the location and take appropriate action,” he said.
Many people who frequent the Smith Center say that they have seen individuals who they identified as homeless sleeping in the building.
Cambridge resident Sheila T. Dillon, who often plays chess on the ground floor of the building, recalled witnessing a security guard checking on a homeless man who appeared to be asleep in December.
“Someone I know is a chess player and homeless and he was dozing off and the security guy respectfully said ‘are you ok?’” Dillion said.
She said he woke up and remained in his seat awake.
Harvard Graduate Student of Education Kristen J. Park has similarly observed security guards waking up homeless people on the building’s first floor.
“I’ve seen people who are visibly homeless sleeping and security guards aren’t too happy about it,” he said. “They gently nudge them and say they’re not allowed to sleep here.”
Sleeping itself is not grounds for removal from the building. Catalano wrote that removing people from the building or issuing no-trespass orders depends on how people react to being asked to wake up.
Harvard students, too, fall asleep in common spaces, according to frequent visitors of the Smith Center.
Ariel G. Silverman ’22 said that she has seen students sleeping on a couple occasions without intervention from security guards.
“I didn’t see a security guard wake them up but I wasn’t around for awhile, so it’s possible,” she said.
Suyeon Lee ’22 also said that she often sees her classmates sleeping at the Smith Center without disturbance.
“I come to Smith almost every day and every time I see them,” she said. “Maybe they’re not asleep but just like closing their eyes, you know.”
She said that she has never seen a security guard wake up students.
Others, however, have observed security guards waking napping Harvard students.
Harvard Extension School student Larry A. Gil said that he typically comes to the Smith Center a couple times each week. He said that each time he’s there, he sees “young people,” whom he infers are Harvard students, sleeping on a couch in the common space too.
“Security comes and wakes them up,” he said.
Catalano underscored HUPD’s commitment to enforcing the rules without prejudice.
“Although some of the complaints have been associated with persons who self-identify as homeless, the Department is concerned about inappropriate or illegal behavior committed on campus regardless of the status or affiliation of person(s) involved,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When attorneys for Harvard and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions returned to the courthouse last Wednesday to present closing arguments in a high-profile trial centered on the College's alleged discrimination against Asian-American applicants, they decided to focus on the facts.
Wednesday’s arguments — which fixated heavily on statistical analysis of admissions data, particularly applicants’ personal ratings — are indicative of the significance data will have if the case proceeds to an appeals, according to multiple legal experts. Experts have said it is likely the case will be appealed regardless of federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs’ ruling.
Statistics were also a central feature during the main three-week trial that began in mid-October. Both Harvard and SFFA hired experts to conduct statistical analyses of admissions data. SFFA’s expert’s findings revealed evidence of bias, while Harvard’s did not.
Michael J. Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, wrote that statistics were central to the post-trial arguments because the factual record for any future appeal is established in the district court and will guide future judges’ legal interpretations.
“Trial courts are designed to handle the taking of evidence and factual disputes, while appellate courts consider whether trial courts got the law right,” he wrote in an email. “This means that parties should be aggressively trying to put into the record the facts that support the violations of the law they have identified and the harms hurting the their clients from those violations.”
If the case is appealed, the higher court will not overturn any factual findings set earlier on unless they are “clearly erroneous” and determinative in the interpretation of law, Gerhardt wrote.
Michael J. Klarman, a professor at Harvard Law School, also indicated that appeals courts would be very reluctant to reverse the findings of fact Burroughs establishes.
“The trial judge will make findings as to whether Harvard discriminates against [Asian Americans],” he wrote in an email. “Such findings would be difficult, but not impossible, to reverse on appeal.”
The lawsuit’s heavy reliance on statistical analysis and data interpretation places a lot of weight on Burroughs ruling, regardless of how far an appeal effort goes.
“This could be a case where the district court’s decision is by far the most important part of the case,” said Michael W. McConnell, the director of Stanford University’s constitutional law center.
While legal experts agree that the case will be appealed regardless of who wins, many said it is impossible to predict whether an appeals court would be willing to take up the case past the district level.
“Typically a very small percentage of appeals are successful,” said Vinay Harpalani, a law professor at the University of Savannah. “This case may be a little different, though. It is looking at a hot button issue where there is a good amount of disagreement on what the law means.”
That disagreement concerns Harvard being a private university subject to different constitutional protections than public universities that have previously had the policies challenged. Plaintiffs in Grutter v. Bollinger and Fisher v. University of Texas — previous high-profile affirmative action cases — relied heavily on charging that the public institutions infringed on the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, which does not apply to private universities.
“Harvard is not bound by the Equal Protection Clause,” UNC Law Professor Theodore M. Shaw said. “Nonetheless, there are statutes that reach private institutes, including Title VI under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”
Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity that, like Harvard, receives federal funding.
“Title VI can reach private actors unequivocally, there is no doubt about it,” Harpalani said. “I think SFFA is trying to completely redefine intentional discrimination in terms of Title VI, a novel development in the law...What the standard would be under Title VI is not established at all when it comes to discriminatory intent versus disparate impact.”
Adam K. Mortara, the lead attorney for SFFA, cited the Civil Rights Act when building his argument against affirmative action, citing Teamsters v. United States, an employment discrimination suit from 1977. Mortara has argued that the Teamsters case — which ruled that statistics are sufficient to prove racial discrimination — means “statistics alone” can prove that Harvard’s admissions policies are biased without evidence of intentional discrimination.
Harpalani said, however, that even if this legal interpretation was accepted, he does not believe SFFA’s statistics are sufficient evidence.
“If you wanted to do it off statistics alone, which is what SFFA is trying to do, it would have to take really stark statistics, much more impactful than what SFFA has now,” Harpalani said.
Harvard’s attorneys have argued that another suit, Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp., is the applicable precedent in this case. That case ruled that plaintiffs must show proof of intentional discrimination, which is “near impossible” to prove, according to Harpalani.
Under that precedent, anecdotal evidence raised in post-trial arguments may be used to show intent alongside the statistics. Attorneys dedicated some of their time in last week’s hearing to reestablishing or disputing the existence of such evidence.
“Even under Arlington Heights, there’s significant circumstantial evidence,” Mortara argued last Wednesday.
Harvard attorneys disagreed.
“At the end of the day, under Teamsters or Arlington Heights, the court still has to resolve the question whether Harvard intended to discriminate, and it still has to do that considering all the evidence, non-statistical and statistical,” Seth P. Waxman, one of Harvard’s lawyers, said in his closing argument.
Burroughs is expected to issue her decision in the coming months, but the case’s future in appellate courts remains uncertain.
“It is too soon to make any judgments,” Shaw said. “Trying to figure out where this case will go is a fool’s errand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Adams House renovations timeline, previously slated to begin in June 2019 and take three years, will now extend another year and conclude by August 2023, Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators announced at a Tuesday town hall.
The announcement came as FAS Assistant Dean for Physical Resources Merle Bicknell, Faculty Deans Sean G. Palfrey ’67 and Judith “Judy” S. Palfrey ’67, and architect Nathaniel F. R. Rogers ’05 presented the three-stage renewal plan – designed to improve accessibility, address overcrowding issues, and expand student social spaces – to House affiliates. Bicknell said in an interview that the renovation will take longer than previous renewal projects due to factors including “cost reasons” and Adams’s location in the center of Harvard Square.
“We’re in such an urban environment that there’s really no kind of area for staging and things of that sort,” Bicknell said.
“If you’re thinking about cash flow, it’s better to phase it out for cost reasons as well,” she added.
The newly announced plans are the latest development in the over $1 billion House Renewal initiative, which has included the complete overhaul of several historic dormitories in Harvard Square. Winthrop House and Dunster House each underwent one-year renovations, and Lowell House is set to re-open prior to Commencement this spring following its “most complex” two-year restoration.
The project has faced financial woes in recent years, relying on donations and increasing pools of debt financing as the University’s Capital Campaign came to a close in June 2018 and the Harvard Management Corporation faces historically low endowment returns. Former FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in a 2017 report that financial constraints were a major component of the decision to extend the Adams construction timeline to three years. Now, it will last four.
Adams will be the first house to see construction span three separate phases. Claverly Hall and Senior House are scheduled to open in August 2020; Randolph Hall and Apthorp House in August 2021; and Russell Hall, common spaces including the dining hall, and Westmorly Court in August 2023.
Rogers – an architect from Beyer Blinder Belle, a New York City-based firm that worked on renovations for Winthrop, Dunster, Quincy House, and Leverett House – said Adams will meet LEED Gold environmental certification standards after renovations. He added that the House will be more accessible following the addition of eight elevators throughout the buildings.
The renovations will add air-conditioning to public areas including the dining hall and the library, and suites will feature fans, central air circulation, and the necessary infrastructure for future air-conditioning installation in residents’ rooms.
Rogers said the renovations will include creating a 2000-square-foot multipurpose loft above the dining hall, adding new meeting and social spaces, relocating the gym, and modernizing the Pool Theater with features like an adjustable seating configuration.
“We’re not restoring the pool function,” Rogers said to laughter from student attendees.
Rogers said the redesigned physical layout will better fit Adams’ current population of 450 students to minimize the number of students who opt to convert their common room into an additional bedroom. The renovations will also add more hallway bathrooms, though not as many as have been added to Dunster and Winthrop.
Unlike Lowell students, who were all required to vacate their residence for the Inn at Harvard and other University-owned apartments around the Square for the duration of their house’s renovation, Adams housing will be split between current dorms and swing accomodations over the next four years. Though Adams dining hall will be open the first two years of renewal, facilities at the Inn will take its place during the third phase of the renovations.
Administrators held several town halls in spring 2018, during which students could offer input about the issues they would like to see addressed in the renovations. Student concerns included congestion of common areas and the preservation of distinctive spaces like the Lower Common Room and the dining hall. They also said they wanted Adams to retain its “weird” and “Hogwartsian” character.
Bicknell said in an interview that preserving Adams’ hallmark culture was a “giant priority.”
“This was something we heard from students a year ago when we met with them: Keep Adams ‘Adams,’ keep all the special quirkiness of Adams,” Bicknell said. “People will be able to come back and this room will feel exactly like it does, but it will have air conditioning and it will have all those other things.”
Adams administrators will host another information session for residents on March 26 to outline a much-anticipated housing lottery process for the 2019-2020 academic year; the lottery will begin on April 15.
Interested Adams students will have the opportunity to join a committee tasked with brainstorming the design of new common spaces, furniture selection, and decorations throughout the House.
Correction: March 3, 2019
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that FAS Assistant Dean for Physical Resources Merle Bicknell cited “cost reasons” and Adams’ urban location as reasons for extending the renovation timeline from three to four years. In fact, Bicknell was explaining why the Adams project is phased along a timeline longer than the other renewal projects."

A tenacious cold is something we wouldn’t wish upon our worst enemies. These colds are relentless. You try to quell them with “resting” and “staying hydrated,” but a week later, you’re still going through tissues at a rate that would make the Lorax cry. If this sounds like you, read on for some unpleasant things you can do in order to recover.
Consume your Weight in Vitamin C
We all know Vitamin C is good for your immune system. Fill your backpack up with dhall oranges and get to work — but fair warning: By the time you’re done eating them, you might never want to see a citrus fruit again.
Sweat it Out
Keeping warm is essential when you have a cold. Sweating will also get you feeling good about your bod again after the dreadful Freshman 15. Gulp down a cup of hot tea, layer on four sweaters, and proceed to stand in the bathroom while your roommate is showering. If you’re feeling really inspired, make the trek to the Malkin Athletic Center and do some running on a treadmill in full attire. This remedy is guaranteed to make you feel like you deserve a speedy recovery — whether the unpleasant part is dripping sweat in your itchy makeshift sauna or being subjected to your roommate’s shower music is up to you.
Clean Everything 
After rudely intruding on your poor roommate’s shower, you probably owe them a favor. Douse the room in disinfectant spray (citrus-scented, if you can still handle it) and clean like you’re back in Fall Clean Up. If there are no more germs around you, we should hope your symptoms won’t get worse.
Suffer Through Juice Shots
Trust me — when health bloggers describe ginger juice immunity shots as “spicy,” they really aren’t lying. College students have a reputation for tolerating fairly unpleasant drinks, but a ginger-lemon-cayenne-gosh-knows-what health combo clocks in at whole new level. Nothing says “I’m putting in work to get better” like actually buying an immunity-boosting juice shot and somehow managing to drink the whole thing.
You don’t have to argue with us — we know these tips might not seem the most appealing. But haven’t you ever heard the expression no pain, no gain?

On Sunday, Feb. 17, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New England hosted Boston’s 2019 Lion Dance Parade to celebrate the Year of the Pig. The parade featured ten local lion dance troupes, including the Wah Lum Kung Fu Athletic Association, the Boston Chinese Free Masons Athletic Club, and the Calvin Chin Martial Arts Academy.
Around 9:30 a.m., members of the Wah Lum Kung Fu Athletic Association gathered in their second-floor studio above the Moon Villa Restaurant. Before performers braved the Sunday morning cold, Master Instructor Bob Rosen delivered a short speech briefing them on the coming celebration. Performers then carted equipment into the streets and headed to the staging grounds for the parade’s opening ceremony.
Spectators and performers alike waited as dance troupes filed onto Harrison Avenue in preparation for opening remarks by the event’s organizers.
After a series of speeches and a short performance, the Boston Chinese Free Masons Athletic Club took to the streets to kick off the parade. Led by teams of drummers and percussionists, each dance troupe performed a series of rituals at each Chinatown storefront.
Dancers from Calvin Chin’s Martial Arts Academy visited the inside of the Gourmet China House on Beach Street. A restaurant employee then presented the lions with a cabbage, an orange, and a red envelope containing money before lighting a string of firecrackers. The ritual is a part of the "cai qing" custom: The lion dance is believed to bring businesses prosperity and good luck in the new year.
Spectators “fed” the lions money, both as a donation to the performers and a symbolic gesture good luck.
As dance troupes made their way through the streets of Chinatown, the cacophony of drums, symbols, and firecrackers drew the attention of restaurant-goers.
