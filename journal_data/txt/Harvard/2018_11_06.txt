After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The memoir “You’ve Been So Lucky Already” isn’t interested in anchoring itself in one experience. Its author, Alethea W. Black ’91,  has written a reflection on both mental and physical health: a study of the kaleidoscopic feelings of anxiety, worry, and depression that reoccur in her life — particularly after the tragic loss of her beloved father, MIT professor and mathematician Fischer Black. Though at times its narrative feels unstructured and unmoored, Black’s memoir humorously and quite touchingly presents an account of external loss and personal discovery.
Death and tragedy have always revolved around Black. Her father’s death is foreshadowed very early on, and Black insists to her readers that she has always been somewhat in touch with a darker world. She frequently hears voices at night, the most prominent of which comes during her teens after a classmate, Andrew, commits suicide. Though he wasn’t a close friend, Andrew visits her dreams with a disturbing urgency, his death fast becoming an life-altering experience for Black: “All these things conspire to make me suspicious about the nature of existence.”
This tragedy is presented in conjunction with the events that occur leading up to her father’s illness and eventual passing. Black recounts many anecdotes about their time together, describing in rich detail the feeling of security he exuded, the brilliance and wit he displayed. She also captures the strife in their relationship as they grow apart due to her parent’s divorce. When it comes to the logistics of his actual illness and death, Black strangely pulls away. This is perhaps symptomatic of her desire to keep parts of the memories untouched.
In general, the book unabashedly probes the many obstacles she faces and the experiences that change her. Black is not afraid to open herself up to the reader, telling us about her eating disorders, the hurt from countless failed relationships, and even an abortion.  By the end, however, we encounter a woman tough as nails — a self-proclaimed “woman on fire”: “A woman on fire is a woman who speaks, who is not cowed, who is not too polite, but who takes the reins of her life into her hands and blazes brightly.”
Black’s post-Harvard life is quite the pilgrimage: She explores her shell-shocked state following her father’s death during which she aimlessly wanders around New York, struggling to contain her depression. She eventually speaks to her successful experience working in magazine publishing, and the sickness that consumes much of her adult life as well as the years she spends in and out of treatment or else lost on the internet determined to cure herself.
For each of the three parts of her book, Black has an introduction describing the current status of her life using a present tense, second person narration. The “you” of this narrative is of course her, but the technique forces the reader into her shoes: “You don’t give the finger to the black pickup truck that tailgates and passes you aggressively, then let go of the wheel to give it two fingers when you see a rainbow-colored peace sticker on its bumper.” Just for a moment, this forces you to be in the wild world of Alethea Black in the most terrifying and exhilarating way. These chapters are particularly rife with her razor-sharp humor.
During one such chapter, Black is babysitting her friend’s six-month year old baby. She is about to read him a story, but finds all the books unworthy of being read. Her solution is downright hilarious: “You decide to give him a taste of John Keats, to expand his horizons.” Surprisingly, the baby likes it.
Another humorous anecdote recounts the visit of a college roommate — a serial dieter who is so competitive that she even takes losing weight or dieting as a competition: “She begins to monitor what I eat, and comment on it. The she starts monitoring what the dog eats.” This makes her realize that her friend has always been a bit of a bully — but perhaps more importantly, that Black has allowed these situations to happen to herself. In the end, the heart of the matter is that Black always comes back to self-realizations, which give her memoir purpose. Since there is a distinct lack of organization in its structure, this purpose is a particularly welcome feeling.
With humor and candor, “You’ve Been So Lucky Already” makes serious discussions of health, illness, and tragedy much more palatable. Yet she manages to strike a balance, never losing the emotions and the struggles that come with this territory. Though its structure could have been tighter and some of its anecdotes are less funny than others, it is an altogether rather compelling tale of journey and recovery.

John Ashbery’s complete library has just been donated to Houghton Library’s Woodberry Poetry Room where Ashbery delivered his first poems as an undergraduate in the 1940s. This month, the cataloging of six- to seven-thousand manuscripts, papers, and books will commence, slated for completion in 2020.
Christina Davis, the Woodberry Poetry Room’s curator, made this announcement on Thursday, Nov. 1 in an introduction to a reading by acclaimed American poets Ann Lauterbach and Dara Wier, both of whom knew Ashbery throughout his career.
“I learned that they were all dear friends at this memorial service [in Dec. 2017],” Davis said. “When I was trying to find a meaningful way to make this announcement, it seemed like the legacy of his friendship would be the perfect portal through which to announce it.”
Previously stored at his homes in Chelsea and Hudson, NY, the comprehensive collection of Ashbery’s works is what Davis describes as “the 20th century iteration of what a poet’s library could be.” Already, Houghton is home to the Emily Dickinson library, to which Davis pointed as an exemplary collection of a 19th century poet. The Ashbery library, she says, will be an immersive experience: For example, visitors of the Woodberry Poetry Room will even be able to sit at Ashbery’s own writing desk.
Ashbery’s poetry triangulates well with Lauterbach and Wier, Davis added. “For both of these poets, his death is still very raw.”
“I think I was lucky to be a good friend of his for most of my adult life,” Wier said. At the reading itself, Wier stood first and declaimed four of her poems. The first came from her collection “In the Still of the Night” and is titled “The Usual Ratio of Banality to Wonder.” This, she explained, was a newspaper headline that had caught her attention: She didn’t understand how such a ratio could possibly be known.
The poems she selected meditated on the power of poetry and the boldness of art. For example, “The Usual Ratio of Banality to Wonder” says that “Embarrassed poets are pretty worthless to humanity.”
Wier then read three of her newer poems: “Things Art Can Do,” “Waiting,” and “During the Time You Are Deceased.” This last poem, she said, hopefully had a “slight leavening effect” on the audience, shedding a light on the “truth we all have to face with our loved ones.” Wier’s late husband, the poet James Tate, was friends with Ashbery as well.
Lauterbach’s reading closed the event. Kate Colby, who introduced both poets, remarked that Lauterbach’s poetry is distinctive for its metaphysical rigor; by contrast, Lauterbach praised Wier’s poetry for being “straightforward” without being literal. Lauterbach, like Wier, has known Ashbery since the 1970s, when they met while working in London.
At the reading, Lauterbach presented several short poems, which played with ideas of time and art-making. They included “Of This,” “Intent, Intend” (a prose poem from her new collection, “Spell,” “Spell” (the title poem of this same collection), “After After Nature,” and “Thread.”
While reading, Lauterbach uses one hand to swoop and trace arcs through the air, like a conductor. “I’m drawing the space of sound, which is not the same as conducting,” she said, but rather a visualization of her words.
Lauterbach, like Wier, expressed faith in the power of poetry to influence an audience.
“One fundamental desire [of mine] is for people to love language, and to feel that language actually can make some impact on the world,” she said. “We’re living in a time when language is so damaged in the public sphere that to awaken to a resistance is what I would like to see happen.”

Kathy Wang’s debut novel “Family Trust” consists mostly of financial minutiae and organ failure. The novel is not, at first glance, a light read. Topically, “Family Trust” traces the fight over a controversial will; thematically, the pun in the title (“trust” as in finance, “trust” as in faith) gives a good indication of its subjects. When the slow, excruciating death of a father is your book’s comic relief, then you have a very serious book — and still, somehow, Wang has written a debut novel that is sharp, considerate, and endlessly engaging.
“Family Trust” begins (and later ends) with Stanley Huang, the book’s temperamental patriarch. Within a few pages, the reader learns that Stanley is dying of pancreatic cancer, and the following book centers around his death and — much more contentiously — his will. In the running to receive Stanley’s supposed millions are his ex-wife (the comically dry Linda), his son (Fred, an aspiring venture capitalist), his daughter (Kate, the perpetual caretaker), and his current wife (the young, bland Mary). With the cast thus set, chaos ensues. There’s adultery, the collapse of several marriages, and the destruction of a major financial scheme — all culminating in a remarkably effective, throw-the-book-across-the-room kind of plot twist.
The most important thing to understand about “Family Trust,” however, is that it is primarily a book about money. Wang herself is a Harvard Business School alum, and the novel highlights both general business and the HBS landscape (the Cambridge pizza icon Pinocchio’s gets a shoutout on page 10). The text’s focus on finance is relentless. At every emotional, climactic moment, a character, usually Linda, can be counted on to break the tension with a thought about mortgages. “Family Trust”’s big moral conclusion is a scene in which Linda decides to go outside and enjoy the sunshine — and even that level of sentimentality feels out of place. “There is a deal between every couple, though it isn’t between husband and wife,” a minor character tells Kate. “It is between who has the money and who doesn’t.”
At times then, “Family Trust” can be hard to warm up to. Characters are rarely open and almost never nice. Kate, usually the most sympathetic of the bunch, also has less of Linda or Fred’s comedic bite. Stanley, the least sympathetic, is probably the funniest (“Your father’s a fool,” Linda says to her children, and she’s right). Wang is more likely to humiliate her characters than to humanize them — in any other book, her graphic descriptions of Stanley’s death would feel brutal. The scene where it becomes clear that Stanley needs adult diapers, for example, lies somewhere in between horrifying and heartbreaking. But even when Wang details her characters’ failings at length, and even when those failings are serious or sad, its constant interest in money is what saves “Family Trust.” After all, upon realizing that Stanley can no longer make it to the bathroom, Mary observes only that “it was too late for him to sign anything else over or fix his past financial mistakes.”
This is not to say that “Family Trust” is heartless. Wang is not synonymous with her characters, and she makes a good faith effort to — as the book’s inside flap puts it — “skewer the ambition and desires that drive Silicon Valley.” If Wang’s cynicism makes her characters feel cold, then it also offers a lively commentary on the tech world. Kate, for example, is a victim of sexual violence (her world is “filled with violent, thin-skinned men”), while Fred is something of a perpetrator. Wang’s sympathetic juxtaposition of the two is jarring: After Kate is harmed, she uses the event to catapult her career, while after Fred gets accused, his career is temporarily over. Both of them, however, are somewhat unlikeable, and it’s unclear which — if either — is supposed to be more sympathetic.
Racial discrimination, too, is frequently the subject of Wang’s dark and ambiguous humor. “Can the company definitively state it is not deliberately limiting Asian and Indian hires in order to meet certain diversity standards?” Fred asks a human resources worker in a job interview. “We are committed as a company to the concept — the concept of equality,” the worker stammers in reply. In both cases — that is, in Wang’s treatment of race and her treatment of gender — her characters’ sheer unlikability mutes. Nevertheless, the commentary is ever-present, and Wang’s snark keeps her politics from becoming heavy-handed.
To her enormous credit, Wang also holds very little space for stereotypes. Although her characters are all, in a generic sense, bad people, Wang never allows them to devolve into the banal. Men and women alike are gold diggers; Asian Americans and white people are both abusive; the old and the young are equally out of touch. This is “Family Trust”’s modus operandi — it is cynical and biting, but the moral compass behind the humor feels honest.
Linda, so often the bitterest character, is also the best example of the novel’s underlying good nature. When, towards the book’s end, she is placed in danger, the amount of pathos injected into the novel is almost startling. Linda, however, is doggedly stoic. “Life is very difficult,” Mary says to Linda in one of the book’s final scenes. “I never knew how terrible it could be.”
“Life is about solving problems,” Linda replies. “If you cannot respect this, then I have nothing more to say to you.” The line is “Family Trust” all over. Wang’s debut is undeniably harsh and edgy — but it is also clever and, in a pecuniary way, enormously big hearted.

Joking with his wife and three children after a press screening of his new film, Sean Anders and his kids seem like any other American family. Except for one detail: All three kids are adopted. Based on his personal experience fostering and then adopting his children, Anders wrote and directed the movie “Instant Family,” a film about a married couple (played by Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne) who suddenly decide to start a family by fostering three siblings: argumentative, teenage Lizzy (Isabela Moner), anxious Juan (Gustavo Quiroz), and stubborn Lita (Julianna Gamiz).
Unlike how classics like “Stuart Little” or even “Annie” have typically depicted adoption in family films, Anders’s film tells the unglamorized version, filled with emergency room visits, arguments, tantrums, and sheer exhaustion. It was important for him to depict the realities of foster care — in which a couple and several children are thrown together and expected to become a nuclear family overnight — as opposed to the Hollywood ideal, pulling from a variety of stories in order to represent as many different experiences as possible. “From the beginning the idea was that we were going to tell a fictional story that was inspired by my own story, but [that was] also inspired by the stories of a lot of people that we have met along the way,” Anders said.
Anders stressed how important it was for him to reflect the entire fostering process in the film, not just the happy parts. “There is a scene where Mark and Rose are sitting in bed and talking about what a terrible mistake they’ve made and how there's got to be some way back to the clean, happy life they had before,” Anders said. “And my wife and I have had that conversation a number of times, and we’ve come to find out that that’s a pretty relatable scene for a lot of adoptive families, and even [for] people with biological kids.”
While Anders shared that he and his wife were intimidated by the notion of adopting, they ended up connecting with a teenage girl and her two younger siblings, exactly like in the movie. “We got matched with them, and they were going to be our kids,” Anders said. “And we got excited about it actually. And then we got a call from the social worker, and she said that the teen girl had been in care for four years, and she was understandably very connected to her birth mother, and she was still holding out hope that her birth mom was coming back for her. The social worker didn't think that that was very likely, but the girl had turned down the placement for her and her siblings because she wanted to remain available for her mom... That’s where the Lizzie character was born.”
Another important factor in creating the film, Anders explained, was casting actors who were truly invested in his mission of telling the humorous, yet often difficult, truth behind adoption. “Mark [Wahlberg] had met a lot of kids in [foster] care over his travels, so when I suggested the idea to Mark, he jumped in right away and was really excited about doing it,” Anders said. Rose Byrne was equally committed. “The first thing she did is she sat down with my wife, and sat down with a bunch of adoptive moms, and she really did her homework,” Anders added.
Pondering the relationship between comedy and social commentary, Anders said, “If you engage people emotionally and get them to feel something emotionally and then turn that into a laugh, it gives you the best feeling that you can have… Throughout the movie, we’re trying not to shy from the tragedy and the trauma that’s involved with kids coming out of the foster care system, but the reality is that [with] any family that you meet that goes through it, they’ll tell you that there’s a lot of laughter, that you have to laugh, and you have to find the sense of humor in some of these dark things.” Anders laughed himself as he explained his kids’ reaction to seeing themselves on the big screen. “Now they’re sick of it. They’re kind of like, ‘Okay, enough with this movie.’”
“I’m hoping that when people come see the movie, they laugh a lot and they have a good time, and that they have a different idea of who these kids are, and then hopefully if someone in their family or someone they know wants to foster kids or wants to adopt, that they’ll be supportive about it and positive rather than maybe cautioning them or being worried about it,” Anders said. “I think when people hear the words ‘foster care’ it brings to mind a lot of negativity and fear, and what I found in my travels through the system, over and over again, is that you meet the kids, and you go ‘Oh, they’re just kids. They’re just kids, and they need families and they need love, and they have love to give, just like any other kids.’”

 William Forsythe, American dancer and choreographer extraordinaire, spent most of his time overseas in Europe for the past 50 years, working extensively first with Ballet Frankfurt and then founding his namesake dance troupe in 2015, The Forsythe Company. This fall, Boston Ballet and the Institute of Contemporary Art are partnering to welcome Forsythe back to the States for his five-year residency agreement, including a full program of Forsythe’s work in the spring season. At the ICA, “William Forsythe: Choreographic Objects” is on display from Oct. 31 to Feb. 21.
“Choreographic Objects” has previously been presented at global venues, such as London’s Tate Modern and Grande halle de la Villete in Paris. Forsythe now brings these interactive, site-responsive works to the Seaport area in Boston, marking his first comprehensive exhibition in the U.S.
As hybrids of sculpture, artwork, video, and architectural spaces, “Choreographic Objects” invites participants to stimulate and interact with the ideas and movement of choreography. The choreography is as much pieces of artwork as they are spaces for performance and movement.
“Choreography is possible anywhere, and I believe in some ways that this exhibition is the most democratic expression of choreography,” Chief Curator of the ICA Eva Respini said.
With each “choreographic object,” Forsythe included specific physical instructions for visitors to follow, creating a unique space for individualized experiences in the gallery.
In “City of Abstracts,” which consists of a video wall, camera and computer software to delay the playback movements, Forsythe plays with the natural curiosity of humans. Each small movement is converted by the software into dragged out, spiraling movements and shapes. A simple wave of the hand becomes an enthralling spiraling snake of the entire arm.
“What ends up happening is not just a call and response, but what you see on the screen is in fact a score for the piece itself,” Forsythe said at the opening.
In another room of the exhibition, “The Fact of Matter” features 600 polycarbonate gymnastic rings attached to the ceiling by polyester belts and steel rigging. Forsythe’s only instruction is simple: “Please traverse the space using only the rings.”
“The title will speak to you more clearly if you attempt to even go two feet into the work. You normally conceive of yourself as you are an integration of your self-image, of your weight, coordination, and strength,” Forsythe said. “These three aspects are not always going to have integrity under all conditions.”
It is through the struggle of traversing the room that Forsythe sees the choreographic moments.
The ICA exhibition is also premiering two new Forsythe works, including “The Differential Room,” which was made specifically for the museum. It features a series of chalkboards inscribed by Forsythe with a series of assignments, like “take five steps away from the bench then with your eyes closed, walk backwards and sit down.”
“In many of the works, it isn’t about the result, it’s about the effort,” Respini said.
In a following room, Forsythe continues this concept with a steel door titled “Aufwand” that looks like any ordinary door yet is incredibly hard to open due to spring mechanisms.
“You are employed by yourself to produce the work for yourself, not for others. The work can only be made through the work you wish to give to it,” Forsythe said. “We assume that these things are made for us, that the contemporary world of architecture is at our service. But what happens when you encounter uncooperative things? There’s a brief moment where you go ‘what?’”
Participants’ bodies naturally react to the struggle of opening the door. This is the choreography moment: when the knees bend, back arches, hips thrust back, and feet slide then grip on the ground.
“We have a variety of different choreographic objects. We have massive sculptural room size filling site responsive works but also more intimate haptic individual experiences,” Respini said.
Other pieces of Forsythe’s exhibition include a video of breakdancer Rauf “Rubberlegz” Yasit and Julliard alumnus Riley Watts, a room of 80 swinging pendulums, rubber knots, and more.
When describing Forsythe during the ICA talk, Artistic Director of Boston Ballet Mikko Nissinen places Forsythe as the Michael Jackson of the dance world — a “demigod of art.” The exhibition at the ICA shows just why Nissinen gives Forsythe these titles.
“When Bill works with the dancers, I can see them grow,” Nissinen said. “At the San Francisco Ballet, within one single hour when I was working with Bill, I changed as a dancer, I thought about dance differently, and I danced everything differently.”

In a country where suicide is the tenth leading cause of death overall, where a suicide attempt is made approximately every 28 seconds, and where only 10 states mandate that healthcare professionals complete suicide prevention training, mental illness is a pressing concern. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most stigmatized. Though research on the topic is sparse, a 2007 survey demonstrates the pervasiveness of suicide’s stigma, expressions of which range from avoidance and unhelpful advice to the active blaming of victims or their families.
Professionally recommended methods of combating the stigma include talking openly about mental health and humanizing those afflicted by mental illnesses. Music has long been a favored medium for encouraging the abandonment of prejudices. So it is no surprise that artists have turned to musical theater as a forum for shedding light on these topics.
Since its Broadway debut in 2016, smash-hit “Dear Evan Hansen” has been hailed for starting conversations about suicide with potentially life-saving results. Featuring a main character who is in therapy for his severe social anxiety, the original musical unflinchingly addresses themes of perceived isolation, attempted suicide, and the innate desperation to be loved. Yet, while certainly important, the musical is not the first to tackle such subjects.
Before “Dear Evan Hansen” captured the national spotlight, “Fun Home” had garnered popular and critical acclaim as the hard-hitting, Tony-winning surprise of 2015. Whereas Evan Hansen grapples with his own mental illness, Alison of “Fun Home” — which is based on the life and memoir of Alison Bechdel, a cartoonist best-known for creating “The Bechdel Test” — attempts to come to terms with her guilt regarding the suicide of her closeted gay father, which occurs just months after Alison comes out as a lesbian to her parents. Structured around the adult Alison remembering her childhood and college years, the show is subtler than “Dear Evan Hansen” yet still delivers a poignant message of self-acceptance.
Still before “Fun Home” came “Next to Normal,” an influential show that the New York Times referred to as “Mental Illness, the Musical.” The eighth musical in history to win a Pulitzer Prize, “Next to Normal” premiered in 2009 to mixed reviews but a general consensus that the show was broaching new ground. Diana, a suburban mother, struggles to cope with worsening bipolar disorder, undergoing accurate treatments such as medication, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. Her destructive behavior, suicide attempt, and memory loss are not romanticized whatsoever, although the show’s end shares a pragmatically hopeful tone with “Fun Home” and “Dear Evan Hansen.”
Acknowledging the importance of accuracy, the creative teams of “Next to Normal” and “Dear Evan Hansen” have emphasized their consultation of mental health experts and suicide prevention groups throughout the writing process, and many productions of “Fun Home” are accompanied by post-show discussions about mental health. Unlike shows such as “Les Misérables” and “Miss Saigon” — both of which use the suicide of a major character as mere plot points — these musicals unapologetically feature mental illness as an integral element of their stories. Each show has its own distinct tone, style, and appeal, yet they share a determination not to belittle, romanticize, or ignore the gritty reality of these themes. Instead, the musicals combine the compelling power of music with the influential platform of Broadway — as well as the now unlimited reach of cast albums via the internet — to create stories capable both of helping audiences rethink their preconceptions and of comforting those with personal ties to mental illness.
America seems to be at a turning point in its willingness to discuss mental illness. More TV shows are openly addressing mental health than ever before. Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” while problematic and heavily criticized by mental health experts, certainly sparked conversations. The CW’s musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” includes the respectful and very specific diagnosis of its main character with borderline personality disorder. Television reaches an even broader audience than does musical theater, and so the manifestation of these themes in such popular shows might suggest the nascent end of the stigma.
While progress has certainly been made, the stigma is far from broken. Even these niche musicals seem caught between fully embracing mental illness and appealing to a mainstream audience. Perhaps noting the instant branding of “Next to Normal” as “Mental Illness, the Musical,” the marketing teams of both “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Fun Home” initially universalized their taglines and advertisements to avoid being known as “the suicide musical” or “the lesbian suicide musical,” respectively. This does not necessarily represent a reluctance on the part of creators to defy stigma. Rather, the vague marketing strategies suggest something about their audience, reflecting a fear that to brand themselves as “suicide musicals” would be to dissuade some audiences from attending. Moreover, the goal of these musicals is to reach precisely the audiences who would rather avoid the theme.
Although public discussion of suicide and mental health is slowly and tentatively being normalized, continued efforts will be necessary to enact lasting change in research standards, legal policies, and America’s ingrained cultural mindset. The importance of spreading awareness and starting conversations must not be undervalued. If “Next to Normal,” “Fun Home,” and “Dear Evan Hansen” have been crucial steps in increasing suicide awareness, it is equally crucial that future works continue to combat the stigma.
— Contributing writer Jessica N. Morandi’s column, “The Might of Musicals,” explores the societal implications of musical theater, with a focus on Broadway and off-Broadway shows.

To Enya Umanzor, being Latina is a joke.
Enya is a Vine star: She has made her name posting Vines, seven second videos filled with slapstick comedy, cursing, and child-like ridiculousness, on social media for her thousands of followers. Enya’s comedy is deeply intertwined with her Latinidad and womanhood. But, both in content and form, it also challenges notions of how laughter and marginalized identity can coexist.
Enya challenges us to ask: What does it mean to laugh, not with, but at, Brown bodies? What does it mean, that is, to be a minstrel?
Minstrelsy is the performance of caricature. As in caricature, the political and ethical power of the marginalized body is neutered, reduced to the status of a plaything. And, as has caricature, minstrelsy has largely disappeared from the realm of high art, while low art’s resistance to standards of taste opens itself up to the practice. No low art form better demonstrates this than that guerilla, pubescent form of comedy we call Vines, which even after the official site was archived have continued to circulate across social media. Dubbed digital Blackface, social media comedy has seen a rise in the use of Black and Brown mannerisms and bodies for comedic effect. Enya is no exception.
In one Vine, Enya complains: “How are some kids so fucking rude to their parents? If I was that rude my parents would throw a tortilla so fast at me it would chop my head off!” Enya often plays off of her Latinidad. Her urban femme Latinx identity is a punchline. Enya listening to Big Poppa is a punchline. Enya not liking President Trump (because he will buy more toupées!) is a punchline. Enya liking tacos is a punchline.
Enya does not portray a Latina woman, but a racist, misogynistic notion of a Latina woman. She, in a move reminiscent of Auntie Walker, lets herself become a caricature. Enya is a force, a pubescent bruja who reeks of inner-city-Miami absurdity and Gen Z transgression. She barrels through life, camera in hand, loudly cursing at her parents, God, and country. She mimes “sitting on dicks”; she screams “We want some pussy!”; she punches her siblings.
In so embodying caricature, Enya lets those watching her, including and especially white folks, laugh at her being Latina. What can this be but minstrelsy? And why should we ever embrace such an aesthetic?
How can a marginalized artist be other than a minstrel? Like SOPHIE, they would have to construct a presentation of their identity that frees itself from the gaze of those in power.
But this depends on a hermetic art, an art that exists solely for marginalized people. Is this possible, in a world where mass art is made accessible for all, where low art is defined by its universality, where white consumption of Brown art is not an exception, but the rule? Perhaps the attempts of marginalized artists to escape the racializing, gendering glare of the powerful are futile.
If freedom is impossible, if the marginalized artist will always be viewed by those in power, and in that consumption be rendered into an object stripped of humanity, a caricature, then what hope is there for an aesthetics of freedom, an artistic project of self-definition?
Enya is not the first artist to become a minstrel. The theorist José Esteban Muñoz explores minstrelsy through the Cubano performance style of choteo, an underground, low form of theater in which the performer both becomes and mocks the role performed. Performance, in choteo, becomes an interrogation of, not assimilation into, socially mandated roles.
This is exactly what Enya does. She performs, for the sake of her white viewers, the American nightmare of the sexed-up, drugged-up, foul-mouthed Latina girl. Minstrelsy has never been an accurate representation of authentic Blackness or Latinidad. It is a performance thereof, an absurd heightening of the features of marginalized existence that does not align with the lived experience of those identities. And in this performance, there is power.
The performance of the minstrel, to quote Muñoz, is “forced labor.” The slave dances, twisted grin like a noose wrapped around their neck, because they must, or they will die. They play the part they are given, because they must, or they will die.
But Enya chooses to perform. If we think of performance as the playing of a role that one is not, Enya reveals that the twisted notion of Latinidad that America holds dear is a joke in reaching so far away from the standards of good taste — in heightening Latinidad to levels of absurdity.
Enya’s performance is parody. And like all good parody, it utterly deconstructs the object of its humor. For Enya, this object is not Latinidad (Enya is not advocating for postracialism) but rather the twisted caricature forced upon Latinx people. Enya deconstructs this caricature not by rationally arguing against it, nor by presenting an alternative, but by leaning into it. To laugh at Enya is to laugh at the racist caricature itself.
Low art, that is, gives us a final, thrilling possibility. We need not become lost in a desperate game of respectability politics. That will only bind us to a never-ending game of power and privilege. Nor do we need to make futile attempts to escape the gaze of those in power.
The raw materials for liberation are already at hand. They are not the master’s tools, but rather the master’s garbage, that which he has foolishly cast away. The minstrel embodies every distasteful notion and expectation placed against marginalized peoples. Rather than flee these notions, the minstrel causes them to self-detonate.
It is in the most profane moments, when one is most firmly in the dung-filled chasm of the low, that the cracks in the crystal castle of whiteness begin to show.

All it takes is one good laugh, one sharp outtake of breath, and it all comes crashing down.
—Contributing writer Nicholas P. Whittaker’s column, "Low End Theory,” digs deep into the archive of bad, taboo, and ugly art, seeking political liberation in the low.

This November, as the homesickness sets in, the stress of midterms heightens, and the dining hall food fails to satisfy, it’s time to cozy up with a few good reads. Compiled below is a roundup of autumn’s best prose featuring family, fall leaves, rainy weather, and of course, turkey.
5. “The Wind in the Willows” by Kenneth Grahame
A heartwarming classic, this children’s tale actually contains countless poignant lessons that even college students can benefit from. Written in 1908, the tale follows the adventures of several anthropomorphic animals as they navigate the worlds of friendship, adventure, and class systems. Filled with descriptions of nature and landscape, it is the perfect fall adventure. Not simply a children’s story, Grahame’s classic comments on the nature of social hierarchy and the relationship between a luxurious country-house upper class and a revolutionary working-class. This tale will pique your imagination, leave you feeling nostalgic about your childhood, and remind you to treat everyone with a little more kindness this season.
4. “The Secret History” by Donna Tartt
Following a California boy named Richard as he navigates the world of an elite liberal arts college, this novel may hit a little too close to home. However, it follows several snobby and elitist classics students and their professor as they deal with the aftermath of the murder of one of their classmates, so let’s hope it isn’t too true to life. With tales of betrayal, immorality, and intrigue, all set in a quintessential New England liberal arts university, this book is the perfect read to delve into from the comfort of your dorm room.
3. “The Cider House Rules” by John Irving
This heart-wrenching novel by John Irving is considered one of his best. Set in early 20th century Maine, the plot follows Dr. Larch, who runs an orphanage and is an abortion doctor, and Homer Wells, the orphan Larch practically raises. Irving deals with a quite controversial and difficult topic, the book is a thought-provoking look at the realities of abortion at a time when it was illegal in America. Perhaps most poignant, however, are the relationships depicted in the novel and the stunning characters that are easy to empathize with. The beautiful descriptions of mist and never-ending fog throughout make this the perfect book to read cozied up in a coffee shop or wrapped in a blanket. Thoughtful, nostalgic, and incredibly well-written, “The Cider House Rules” is a beautiful coming-of-age tale that will not only make you think, but make you feel.
2. “An Old-Fashioned Thanksgiving” by Louisa May Alcott
One of the “Little Women” author’s lesser-known short stories follows the Bassett family in New Hampshire as the children are tasked with preparing Thanksgiving dinner while the parents are called away by a family emergency. Having grown up in Concord, a mere half-hour drive from Harvard — and where “Little Women” was subsequently set — Alcott is no stranger to the autumnal allure of Massachusetts. A light read, this sweet tale will remind you of everything you love about fall in New England, offering everything a short story set in November should: humorous family dynamics, a cozy indoor setting with a roaring fire, and descriptions of warm apple pie. Pick this up in between psets for a wholesome study break that will have you yearning for a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal with your family.
1. “Wuthering Heights” by Emily Brontë
Set against the Yorkshire moors of England, this Victorian classic is the perfect book to curl up with on a rainy day. Bonus points if you’re sipping a cup of tea. The descriptions of the gloomy weather will perfectly match the scene outside your window, and the wild English setting is a kind of comforting chaos. Set as a frame tale — or a story within a story — it is a difficult yet engrossing read, exploring the lives of an isolated and not so socially acceptable family. While the characters are neither heartwarming nor particularly likeable, Catherine and Heathcliff’s tumultuous relationship is a deep look into the flaws that make us human. There is an elusiveness to this book that simply demands it be read.

 “We’re politicians, not murderers.” This line, spoken by an advisor to the British Home Secretary during police inquiries, reflects a central theme in BBC One’s hit television series “Bodyguard,” now available on Netflix. The show does a superb job of raising questions about Britain’s involvement in the war in Afghanistan and the rehabilitation of soldiers all while providing fast-paced action. With compelling acting and a tense soundtrack that engenders serious vicarious anxiety, this series will both enthrall and terrify.
The dashing Richard Madden stars as an Afghanistan war veteran turned cop, Sergeant David Budd, who, after thwarting a terrorist attack on a train, is assigned to protect the staunchly conservative home secretary Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). Budd has reservations about becoming her bodyguard, because she supported the very war that shattered his life — one that left him physically scarred, suffering from PTSD, and separated from his wife Vicky (Sophie Rundle). In his new role, Budd quickly becomes exposed to the dubious world of politics. His superiors at the Metropolitan Police, boss Lorraine Craddock (Pippa Haywood), and head of counter terrorism Commander Anne Samson (Gina McKee), ask him to spy on Montague, suspecting her of corruption and fearmongering. This assignment makes him uneasy, but only more so when he begins an affair with Montague. As continual attacks are made on the home secretary’s life due to internal leaks, Budd struggles to trust those around him. He begins to suspect and investigate a larger, more dangerous, power at hand.
Madden is exceptionally strong in the role of a traumatized Scottish vet. We often see events through his eyes, learning clues when he does or else travelling with him as he investigates. Though he tries suppress it, Budd’s PTSD often gets the better of him. He suffers from frequent panic attacks during which the camera zooms on his face, blurring out the surroundings as intense buzzing blares. These instances are particularly useful in exposing Budd’s frame of mind and allowing access to his tumultuous feelings. Moments like these are also intended to bring to mind the government’s involvement in recent wars draw particular attention to the difficulties that veterans face in reintegrating into society after witnessing unfathomable atrocities.
Hawes is riveting as Montague. Though in many ways her character presents controversial opinions, she is a formidable force of power and her unapologetic attitude is refreshing. She and Madden have excellent chemistry, which almost comes at a surprise given how their relationship begins. Generally speaking, strong female characters bolster the cast — particularly Haywood and McKee with their biting sardonic comments — who prove to be quite a match for many of the condescending males in power.
The show is also concerned with how governments weaponize fear and deeply ingrained xenophobia in order to control citizens and strip them of civil liberties. Montague is most emblematic of this as she plays on people’s distress over terrorism to gain power within her government, but the show also implies that most of the upper-level members of government are equally susceptible to these manipulations.
During a scene early in the first episode, David re-watches Montague’s latest interview, repeatedly rewinding a section during which she gives her thoughts on British interference in the Middle East. Her sentiments on past actions could not be any more clear: “The PM has been very clear on how we deal with the present and build a secure future. That doesn’t require apologizing for the past.” The camera moves in closer to Madden’s livid and fuming face, as the words loop over and over, his rage and trauma growing increasingly palpable. This disapproval and criticism over the Afghanistan War is not a particularly fresh opinion, but this excellently constructed scene exemplifies how the show manages to capture important issues and portray them in electrifying ways.
The excellent soundtrack composed by Ruth Barrett and Ruskin Williamson is also a star of the show. It almost single-handedly enlivens and intensifies the fighting and bomb defusing scenes. Altogether, the combination of high-quality stylistics and frightening, slightly melodramatic action scenes makes the show lively.

In the director’s note for “Next to Normal,” Kier Zimmerman ’20 described the show as a portrayal of “the ugly of mental illness” — the pain it can cause and the suffering it can bring. Zimmerman insisted that the performance was eschewing the use of mental illness as an “empty buzzword” by Harvard organizations. The show, which played at Farkas Hall from Nov. 1 to 3, attempted to bring a voice to this “ugly,” lending a realism to this complex, powerfully-constructed performance.
“Next to Normal” is a 2008 musical written by Brian Yorkey with music by Tom Kitt. The show explores the lives of the Goodman family as they navigate Diana Goodman (Sarah B. Rossman ’19), who has bipolar disorder, and her struggle with bipolar disorder. Delving heavily into questions of loss, dysfunction, and intimacy, this production of “Next to Normal” was produced as part of Rossman’s TDM senior thesis.
The strong cast was key to defining the production: The acting was remarkably realistic, feeling exposed and intimate. The rich vocals were matched with emotional weight. Rossman did an excellent job in her portrayal of Diana Goodman, capturing the audience’s attention with her intensity and ferocity. She gave Diana a depth of emotion that carried the entire show. Having said this, however, another stand-out easily included Sara Bobok ’19, who played Diana’s daughter Natalie Goodman. Bobok successfully showcased the profound anxiety that characterized Natalie. Natalie’s father, Dan Goodman, played by Jake A. Corvino ’19, showed a similar range, performing with rawness and authenticity. On the whole, the cast’s performance was incredibly compelling and marked by realism.
The music pit, composed of undergraduate students from Harvard, Berklee, and Boston University, was equally strong, especially due to an extraordinary string section. The septet skillfully coordinated with the vocals and maintained an impressive dynamic balance. They also successfully paid tribute to a complex and nuanced soundtrack, merging rock styles with more traditional harmonies quite seamlessly. The lighting was the silent hero of the show — it subtly created intermittent moments of otherworldliness through a harshness that helped to sustain the play’s unique atmosphere.
Despite the strength of the performance, it is worth noting that no singular narrative about mental illness is all-encompassing or ideal. The production explicitly acknowledged this difficulty, forcing the audience to ask question what it means to portray mentally ill characters and how we consume content on this topic. In the playbill, Rossman acknowledged that narratives about this topic are never without flaws and encouraged audience members to continue the conversations beyond the boundaries of the show. This commitment to continued conversation was another critical part of the production and what made it all the more significant.
“Next to Normal” was a storied look at the complexity and ugliness associated with mental illness and grief. It forced the audience to engage in the recreation of loss and pain, while simultaneously taking a critical lens to the way we talk about and cope with mental illness. The Goodman family’s struggle with mental illness and its impacts didn’t end with the closing number. Rather, the show’s central takeaway relies on the ways we continue to live with pain.The production is a powerful homage to endurance in an imperfect and painful world.

Actor and comedian Steve Carell may be well known for his comedic characters, but he spoke of far more somber subjects on his recent trip to Boston. Carell, who hails from the local suburb of Concord, Massachusetts, made a red-carpet appearance at the AMC Loews Boston Common screening of his new film, “Beautiful Boy,” on Oct. 18. The film, which was released on Oct. 12, traces the duo-narrative of father David Sheff (Steve Carell) and son Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet) as Nic battles a methamphetamine addiction. The two perspectives are based upon memoirs written by Nic Sheff and David Sheff, a contributor to The New York Times.
Meth, which Carell called an “insidious” drug, has seen a rise in recent years. The New York Times published a feature on it this past February, titled “Meth, the Forgotten Killer, is Back.” In 2014, over 3,700 people died from methamphetamine overdose — more than doubling the number from 2010 — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Carell touched upon the film’s nod to the opioid epidemic at his carpet appearance.
“It's terrifying to see what's happening across the country,” Carell said. “I think even in a small way, a film like this can get some awareness out there.”
Even though humor wasn’t his character’s focal point of the film, Carell said it wasn’t all “doom and gloom,” either. This is also not Carell’s first time diving into a serious character. In 2015, Carell pulled off a complex John E. Du Pont in the sports drama, “Foxcatcher,” earning him an Academy Award nomination.
“There was never any inclination on my part to be funny per se,” Carell said. “But there's also humor and joy even within the darkest moments, so I think we look for those little moments too.”
Although his classic humorous side was missing from the film, Carell said he related to Sheff’s character from a parenting perspective. For Carell, who himself is a parent with two kids — Elisabeth, 17, and John, 14 — he admits how hard it is to imagine Sheff seeing his own son go down the path of addiction. He said that from the moment he had kids, he’s been terrified of “something bad” happening to them, calling it a “parent’s worst nightmare” to see their children in pain.
“To imagine what David Sheff was going through when his son was spiraling out of control with the methamphetamine addiction — it's hard to wrap my head around,” Carell said. “It's hard to comprehend how bad that must've been for him.”
As for his acting relationship with Chalamet, Carell said they worked hard to foster the lived-in father-son relationship of the story. The two actors spent two to three weeks together getting to know each other and rehearsing before filming actually started.
“I think it's important to always feel like there's a bit of a history with the person you're acting with and a comfort level,” Carell said. “We wanted that relationship to feel lived-in, you know, that we had been father and son for all of these years and that we had gone through a lot together before you even see the movie start.”

Even as lead singer Tyler Joseph told the crowd he’d see them again the next time around, Twenty One Pilots’ set at TD Garden felt like the end of the band. Much of this had to do with the subject matter of their most recent album, “Trench.” Lyrics like “They know that it’s almost over” from the album’s closing track allude to the fact that the band’s “Bandito” tour may be their last. Regardless, singer Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun gave it their all in Boston, demonstrating that their spectacle was not without substance.
The band’s entrance set the tone for the rest of the night. Dun initially took the stage after the curtain fell from its rails, masked and holding a lit torch. Joseph then rose up through the stage floor on top of an old car engulfed in flames, also masked. They opened with a few new tracks — ”Jumpsuit” and “Levitate” among them — and performed with remarkable intensity.
The show’s set pieces matched that intensity. Fittingly, risers on the stage levitated during “Levitate.” In the middle of “Fairly Local,” Joseph climbed up onto a riser that elevated him about 20 feet. He then fell backward into a pit in the center of the stage and disappeared. All was black and silent until Joseph reappeared in one of the lower bowl sections and finished the song, taking his mask off after the final chorus to prove he was not a double. A red beanie, reminiscent of the band’s “Blurryface” era, descended from above before “Stressed Out.” Twenty One Pilots transitioned into the show’s quieter moments by physically moving to a b-stage at the other end of the stadium. Their paths to the stage mirrored each member’s personality: Joseph walked over on a descended light fixture, while Dun simply walked.
If any part of the show felt lacking, it was when the band brought Awolnation (of “Sail” fame) and Max Frost, the openers, back onto the stage. They did a good job with the covers — Goo Goo Dolls’ “Iris” and The Beatles’ “Hey Jude” — but their inclusion felt like an unneeded tonal departure. The duo quickly rebounded, though, with their hit song “Ride,” as they left the covers behind as the only questionable part of the night.
The b-stage featured the show’s most emotional moments. Joseph justified the change of pace by saying the band members’ fathers wanted a time to rest their legs. He then told everyone in the crowd to sit down. A new curtain fell over the stage, with a video projected on it. Joseph told a story about “Taxi Cab,” off their eponymous debut, mentioning that it was the first song he ever added a rap to. He delivered that rap — which focuses on an encounter with God after a suicide attempt — flawlessly, never losing the crowd during its emotional rollercoaster. Returning to songs on “Trench,”“Neon Gravestones” matched that emotion with its timely discussion of celebrity suicides. The song and its accompanying visual played off the album’s vulture motif. The other songs on the b-stage, while not as blatantly emotional, dealt with topics like acceptance and writer’s block. “Pet Cheetah,” a song structured around Joseph’s obsession with tinkering with “Trench” before its release, served as a transition back to the front stage. Joseph rapped the entirety of the song on the descended light fixture, which disappeared into the ceiling after the song’s ending.
Joseph and Dun displayed remarkable stamina throughout the concert. Joseph’s voice was able to hit both high notes (especially during “My Blood” and “Morph”) and intense yelling (“Car Radio” and “Holding On To You”). And even throughout a 22-song, drum-heavy set, Dun never missed a beat. He looked like he was enjoying himself, at one point taking off his shirt to reveal “Go Red Sox” written in Sharpie on his chest. Joseph took particular interest in the World Series game, at first refusing to say the score out of respect for those who DVR’d it, before eventually motivating the crowd before the show closer by mentioning that the score was tied but that the Sox would find it in them to win. His prediction was a bit off: The Sox lost to the Dodgers in the early hours of Saturday after 18 innings of baseball.
The show was also physically demanding for both members. At one point, Dun backflipped off a piano, while Joseph made parkour-esque jumps at multiple times during the show. At some points during the set, however, certain members of the pit had to show their own strength. Instead of crowd surfing, Joseph sang while being held up by the crowd after returning from the b-stage. Dun performed a drum solo during “Morph” on a platform also being held up by some strong concertgoers on the floor. Before the show closer, “Trees,” Joseph asked the crowd if they had one more song left in them. At that point, it was astonishing that they had enough energy to keep going. With another set piece, this one involving both members drumming while being supported by the crowd, the band left the stage with Joseph proclaiming, “We’re Twenty One Pilots, and so are you!” With bursts of confetti and uplifting synths, “Trees” encapsulated a night that showed Twenty One Pilots at their best: spectacle without compromise.

When Italian singer-songwriter Andrea Bocelli released his duet with Sarah Brightman, “Time to Say Goodbye,” in 1996, it took Europe by storm, topping billboard charts all over the continent. Then, his 1999 collaboration with Celine Dion, “The Prayer,” was a critical sensation, garnering a Golden Globe and nominations for an Oscar and a Grammy. Now, Bocelli’s new album, “Si,” — the first album of new material he’s released in 14 years — is poised to top this week’s Billboard 200 charts. As with Bocelli’s previous hits, “Si” integrates elements of classical art-song, film scoring and pop music in a way, though tried-and-true, that innovates enough to be as interesting as it is ear-satisfying.
On the surface, much of the album feels very — almost too — familiar. The album’s overarching themes are, on the whole, quite ordinary: They almost never veer far from friendship, love, hope, or the passage of time. Most songs showcase Bocelli’s undyingly smooth yet powerful tenor voice overtop friendly harmonies and lush, cinematic orchestration. There are a smattering of duets with big-name artists, among them Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, as well as Bocelli’s own son, Matteo. Initially, it feels as if “Si” checks off all the boxes a classical-pop crossover album should satisfy — and nothing more.
But where “Si” sparkles is in how faithful it is to this notion of crossover music — it embodies the genre in its entirety. The album’s intentionality manifests itself particularly through its emotional depth and musical nuance. “Un’Anima,” for example, artfully captures the individual’s dichotomy between struggle and hope by means of achingly profound trattenuto vocal lines from the opening minor key to its eventual relative major, which, in turn, is mirrored poetically by transient “shadows” and “mirages” being replaced by massive “cathedrals” and “shooting stars.” On the other hand, “Meditation” — a lyricized version of Jules Massenet’s piece — returns an even more wistful quality than its original theme imparts through an extended use of Bocelli’s delicate lower range and through its equally vulnerable guitar accompaniment.
Bocelli’s album also explicitly — and cleverly — interweaves classical references into his songs. The album opens with an arpeggiated figure almost identical to Johann Sebastian Bach’s first Prelude and Fugue from “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” Indeed, just as Bach’s piece literally represented a founding foray into a new realm of harmonic possibility, Bocelli’s “Ali di Libertà” paves the way, thematically, for the rest of the album, in its simultaneous lyrical uncertainty and hope (mirrored vocally by high passages that are as tender as they are powerful). “Dormi Dormi” layers a stringed version of Bach’s “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” above a synthesized ostinato to create a lilting yet comforting lullaby. “Gloria The Gift of Life,” meanwhile, seamlessly imparts a veritable sense of reverence in its use of melismatic vocal lines typical to the “Gloria” movement of the Roman Ordinary mass.
Perhaps the most daring song on this album is “Vertigo,” a collaboration with pianist Raphael Gualazzi. Lyrically depicted as a ballad toward an enigmatic woman who somehow puts the singer between “vertigo and madness,” it convincingly takes on an imbalanced — yet somehow perfectly poised — musical rhythm, full with mazurka-like accents and roughly delineated rubati. Unlike the rest of the songs, which are imbued with clean, friendly chord progressions, “Vertigo” stumbles in and out of consonance, trying to organize itself somewhat with Gualazzi’s Chopinesque chord repetitions and Bocelli’s robust voice. The solidity of Bocelli’s singing equally contrasts with the capriciousness of the woman of the story and the deftness of the pianist’s performance, all which add to the inherent juxtaposition of ideas — i.e., the crossover — that forms this song-dance.
It is worth noting, too, both the musical effectiveness and emotional beauty of the album’s duets. “Amo Soltanto Te” and “If Only,” Bocelli’s joint works with Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa, respectively, are mellower, more introspective versions of “Time to Say Goodbye,” sharing in its organic, nonlinear phrases and contours but also embody — in a sonorous yet impeccable way — the crossing of two artists: Bocelli’s continually pulsing voice complements both Sheeran’s smooth lines and Lipa’s soulful flare. Meanwhile, “Ave Maria Pietas,” a duet with soprano Aida Garifullina, melds the melodic lines of Romantic art songs with cinematic instrumentation to express impassioned lamentation. It is Bocelli’s duet with his son, “Fall on Me,” however, that is most poignant: Matteo’s English intersects with Andrea’s Italian; his soft, pure voice resonates against the depth of his father’s. Through impassioned verbs followed by soft repetitions of “if you want,” the Bocellis explore trust and family, simply and honestly — and together.
Indeed, Andrea Bocelli’s “Si” serves as a reminder that crossover music is not simply a juxtaposition of elements from two or more different places or times; instead, it is an active, sustained, intentional effort to bring these elements together. What “Si” presents isn’t particularly revolutionary, but it revisits crossover music authentically and with pride. Through his album, Bocelli doesn’t dive into much unfamiliar territory, but he brings us joy by sharing what makes his musical home so great. In that, Bocelli’s album is beautiful.

After “American Teen,” Khalid was almost immediately heralded as one of the voices of our generation. And with five Grammy nominations, collaborations with Kendrick Lamar and Logic, and a certified platinum album, he has the accolades to prove it. But he’s inevitably grown since then. At 20, he is no longer a teen — a label that largely shaped the presentation of his identity, narrative, and success — but still has to undertake the famed name that precedes him.
On Oct. 19, Khalid released “Suncity,” a seven-song EP, his first major project since his debut album. Whereas “American Teen” became the summer anthem for, well, the American teen, “Suncity” captures Khalid on the cusp of adulthood and all the uncertainty that comes with it. Naturally, he has less to say and more to ponder, and his songwriting uncharacteristically (but perhaps inevitably) comes up short. His vocals are as smooth as ever, but he chooses to explore the uncertainties of adulthood through synthesized instrumental expression rather than through the storytelling upon which he established himself, and his palpable inexperience weakens the EP’s cohesion and overall depth.
In a nod to “American Teen,” he covers some of the same themes, albeit less convincingly. In “Saturday Nights,” he describes vague family tension and teenage angst: “And all the things that I know / That your parents don't / They don't care like I do.” The simple guitar progressions and snapping give the song a familiar intimacy, placing all focus on his silky voice, but his lyrics lack the depth that he’s previously shown to possess. The picture he paints is one too applicable, too commonplace to ring as personal, perhaps because he is catering to the demographics of his audience that are changing along with him. His love song fails to create the captivating and vivid stories of “8Teen” and “Hopeless,” which seemed to come so easily for Khalid at the time, making his new attempt feel superficial and juvenile in comparison.
He continues on to explore his uncertainties, fears, and insecurities about adulthood and love through a dreamlike trance, using his voice not for articulation but as another layer of sound. In “Motion,” his words slur together, blending into the swaying and swirling synths that envelop his voice. “Vertigo,” by far the star track, sets his voice against swelling orchestrals as he blurs the line between reality and dreaming: “Are we alive? / Or are we dreaming?” He also inserts voice recordings of unidentified people liberally, both at the end of songs and as the interludes themselves — “I think I'm fearful of things like traveling / I'm fearful of failure / I'm fearful of being embarrassed / Things like that I think hinder me from the best that I can sometimes,” says a female voice in “Salem’s Interlude” in what sounds like an unscripted voicemail — which complicates the narrative continuity within the EP and seems to put forth the many voices swarming inside Khalid’s head.
This dreaminess nearly permeates the EP — that is, until the title track, a Latin pop duet with Empress Of. It’s undoubtedly catchy, but it feels distinctly out of place with its bouncy, sensual beat. They sing in Spanish in unison, “Llévame, llévame / Donde dejé mi corazón” (Take me, Take me / Where I left my heart). It’s starkly different than his usual, nostalgic ballads in a way that feels unsubstantiated, and Empress Of takes control with her ethereal singing and a rhythm characteristic of her own electronic pop, leaving Khalid largely in the background.
“Suncity” lacks the cohesion — tonally and thematically — to be great, but maybe it was inevitable for an artist whose initial success capitalized on an ephemeral life stage that he articulated geniusly well. He’s between decades and nearing the edge of adulthood — “Suncity” is not an end product but, as Khalid himself puts it, the “start of a new era”: a coming of age, and a stepping stone in establishing himself as an experimental forerunner in R&B.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After nearly a decade-long hiatus, the Black Eyed Peas are back, but not as the band the world knew them as. With the release of their new album, “Masters of the Sun Vol. 1,” the Black Eyed Peas rebranded themselves as returning back to their hip-hop, pre-Fergie roots. In fact, Fergie does not show up on this album at all. While the album is a clear move away from the pop, dance song days that built up the Black Eyed Peas’ popularity, it is a successful example of incorporating activism into art, focusing more on imbuing their music with meaning and soul rather than giving it the pomp that would appeal to the masses.
The album was produced by will.i.am, with the title seeming to reference his graphic novel “Masters of the Sun ― The Zombie Chronicles,” published by Marvel Comics. Like the album, the comic deals with expansive issues like that of gang culture, but it is clear that the comic allows for more creative leeway. While the album is full of nostalgic hip-hop tracks addressing various societal problems from gun control to police brutality in America, the songs do so in very subtle manners.
The album opens with a song titled “BACK 2 HIPHOP,” rebranding the trio as going back to their roots, with gentle ’90s beats. The bridge, in particular, has a very ethereal sound, as featured artist, Nas, and the band sing, “Bring it back / It’s a resur-re-rection bring it back.” The song establishes the way in which the album was not just going back to the hip-hop genre in sound but also in content, with more pointed songs in meanings that can double as slam poetry without the background sound.
However, it is clear which songs were written in relation to particular events and more focused on making a statement, with substantially stronger lyrical content compared to the rest of the songs on the album. “RING THE ALARM pt.1 pt.2 pt.3” and “CONSTANT pt.1 pt.2” were written and released ahead of the full album after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson and the election of Donald Trump, respectively.
“RING THE ALARM pt.1 pt.2 pt.3” begins with “Wake up! / I wanna say what’s on my motherfuckin’ conscious / The whole world right now is fucking bonkers” over jazzy instrumentals and steady synth beats, and is broken up into three main verses. The most powerful part is the third verse as the trio raps “Villains in the White House, heroes in their coffins / Leaders double cross while we kneeling to our crosses / Whose policing the police, why they stalking? / All lives matter ‘til your color is the target.”
Similarly, “CONSTANT pt.1 pt.2” is lyrically heavy, but is able to more successfully strike the balance between having deeper meanings and implications and being a catchy, potential radio hit. The song references the larger project will.i.am has created as the group sings, “Master of the Sun, we rocking these comics / Better beware, spiritual warfare.” As a more fast-paced track compared to other songs on the album, the song is a tribute to the old Black Eyed Peas days.
Though none of the songs on the album are as catchy as past hit songs like “I Gotta Feeling” or “Boom Boom Pow,” remnants of their EDM and pop days can also be heard in “DOPENESS” and “BIG LOVE.” Fergie’s voice is replaced by other featured female artists, from CL to Nicole Scherzinger, giving songs variation in sound and a lighter mood.
“BIG LOVE,” in particular, is a standout because it sounds like the follow up to one of the Black Eyed Peas’ most popular songs from 2003, “Where Is The Love?” As a pop rap song, it holds the same, upbeat catchiness as “Where Is The Love?” and is the perfect conclusion to the album. It addresses the issues of “a day in a life of a kid in America,” focusing particularly on gun violence, but it also spreads a hopeful message of how “all that we're made of / Is big, big love.”
With “Masters of the Sun Vol. 1,” the Black Eyed Peas attempts to use their status as one of the most successful groups in the world 10 years ago to address prominent issues in society today. While many of the songs on the album are not made for the radio or the dance floor, the messages they spread on the album are clear. Inspired to use music for social justice, the songs are able to capture the intensity of the current political and social climate of America and a desperation to fix all the issues of today.

It was a whirlwind summer for Ariana Grande. The death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and her highly publicized engagement to “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson coincided with the lead-up to the August release of her album “Sweetener.” All the while, Grande continued to struggle with her mental health in the aftermath of the Manchester concert terrorist attack. With all of it came the internet’s usual storm of vitriol and anonymous hate. The dust around her never seemed to settle.
How does a celebrity respond to cruel gossip and internet toxicity without stooping to its level and replicating the cattiness herself? In “thank u, next,” the single she dropped on Saturday, Grande opts for brazen self-empowerment, reaffirming that she has never depended on a man to be relevant.
For all intents and purposes, “thank u, next” is a diss track. The kicker is that it’s disarmingly polite. Grande forgoes both the swaggering braggadocio and the desperate regret typical of breakup songs, choosing to espouse acceptance, forgiveness, and self-love instead : “I’m so fucking grateful for my ex,” she asserts in the chorus. In the age of internet takedown culture, the same one that often has Grande in its crosshairs, kindness feels particularly radical. “no drags.... no shade..... jus love, gratitude, acceptance, honesty, forgiveness ... and growth,” she tweeted recently. (A brief, indirect exchange earlier this week between Davidson and Grande seemed to suggest some vestigial rancor: In an SNL promo, Davidson jokingly proposed to Maggie Rogers, and Grande tweeted, “For somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh.” However, in the song, Grande is even gracious toward her most recent ex: “Even almost got married / And for Pete, I’m so thankful,” she sings in the opening verse.)
Lyrically and compositionally, “thank u, next,” could be faulted for its simplistic chorus. With another singer, the repetitive four-note verse motif and two-note chorus melody might have sounded grating. But with her four-octave vocal range, Grande makes difficult riffs sound like off-the-cuff vocalizing. She’s effortless, from the notoriously difficult bel canto whistle register of Mariah Carey’s “Emotions” to a belted rendition of “The Wizard and I” for an anniversary special of the Broadway musical, “Wicked.” While it doesn’t reach the upper limits of her (seemingly infinite) register, “thank u, next” is no exception when it comes to exquisite vocals. Grande is a powerhouse, and she flexes in smooth, floaty melismas and layered, multi-part harmonies.
As impressive as Grande’s vocals are, what’s most satisfying about “thank u, next” isn’t sonic, but thematic. As a self-described feminist, Grande has previously embraced empowerment as part of her ethos. In a viral video from three years ago, she defiantly declined to comment on the rumors about her love life, saying, “I’m not Big Sean’s ex. I’m not Niall’s possible new girl. I’m Ariana Grande, and if that’s not interesting enough, don’t talk to me.” The same badass energy both shrugs off the rumors and unequivocally asserts her own self-worth in this single. Even the title is blasé, unbothered by drama: “thank u, next,” is punctuated with the same dismissive syntax of an “I’m over it” text message or tweet. Not only does Grande turn failed love into potential for growth, but she also embodies an iteration of herself who learned her lessons and returned better than before, self-assured and fortified by loss. “I know they say I move on too fast / But this one gon’ last,” she sings. “‘Cause her name is Ari, / And I’m so good with that.” The second verse flips the script on who’s got the power: “She taught me love, / She taught me patience / How she handles pain / Yeah, that shit’s amazing.”
The strongest suit of “thank u, next” is its precision. Here, Grande moves past the oversimplified rhetoric of generic female empowerment (“You’ll believe god is a woman,” “I’m so successful”) and the gauzy sugar of love songs (“I’m so into you,” “I need to be the one who takes you home”). This level of specificity is a territory where few singers have gone before. Even Taylor Swift, a certified pro at thinly veiled references to exes, tries to keep a front of mystery, in hopes of leaving room for interpretation. Ariana Grande puts a new spin on that tradition by lifting the veil and dropping names. She doesn’t want to be excluded from that narrative. She wants to write it herself.
And the song is a smash.

Today marks the conclusion of a dramatic midterm election season that has roiled the country and this campus in innumerable ways. The seeds of change sown today could affect this campus for years to come. Therefore, there is only one thing to say to our eligible classmates: Go vote!
There are numerous reasons why voting is important, and we do not plan to reiterate them all here, but readers should remember that voting is both a power and a right. There is power in casting one’s ballot — especially in memory of those who dedicated their lives over the centuries to secure this right. We also must remember our undocumented or international peers who cannot vote but whose lives may change as a result of this election.
Voters have perennial concerns that a specific candidate or issue may be uninteresting or unimportant. Yet every ballot item has consequences. As citizens, we have an obligation to be informed about all issues on the ballot and vote for them, as just because an issue may not affect one personally does not mean it does not exist.
This is especially important if one is voting in Cambridge, our home for most of the year. Harvard is not Cambridge; the issues on the ballot have repercussions stretching beyond the Square. The nature of the ballot itself, with its binary “Yes” or “No” options on ballot questions, and the choice between parties’ nominees (with, admittedly, a write-in option), can often belie the complex truth and debate behind initiatives and candidates. We must do our best to break beyond this and fully understand the stakes of our decisions.
We have appreciated the various initiatives our community has put together to encourage Harvard to vote; for instance, we reaffirm our appreciation of the Harvard-Yale Votes Challenge, now down to the wire (especially in the face of The Game next weekend). But these get-out-the-vote efforts may potentially reinforce the notion that voting is only important this election. This is not the case. Voting is always important, not just now or in two years, and eligible students should use this election as an opportunity to reinforce this good habit of voting for the rest of their lives.
Regardless of which party or ideology is dominant in the country, voters must participate in every single election cycle. Today is not a one-off event. We hope that the Challenge and similar initiatives are mindful of this and do not end their work tomorrow, continuing through 2020 and beyond.
The most we can ask of our peers and fellow citizens is to use the power of the critical thinking skills we develop here at Harvard to spend meaningful time considering the various issues on our ballots. It is paramount that voters choose what they believe is the best decision, regardless of what the wider world may say.
This staff editorial is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

To the Editor,
Jay Gonzalez’s recent op-ed in The Crimson seeks to defend a severely misguided tax proposal to the very community it would harm. The truth is that the elimination of tax-exempt status for nine Massachusetts college and universities would have far-reaching and negative consequences for students, research, and the state’s knowledge-based economy.
Harvard’s tax exempt status reflects its sole commitment to a non-profit education and research mission that is directly supported by private donations to Harvard’s endowment over centuries. For Mr. Gonzalez to call his proposal “modest” and “fair” shows a lack of understanding of how endowments work and how these resources directly enable our academic community to advance our mission and its public good. Nowhere is that more evident than in support for financial aid, which Mr. Gonzalez blithely dismisses.
One hundred percent of Harvard College students can graduate debt free. All aid at Harvard College is given on the basis of need. The University’s commitment to expanding access and affordability means that families with an annual income of less than $65,000 pay nothing toward the total cost of their child’s education, while families with incomes between $65,000 and $150,000 contribute no more than 10 percent of their income.
In this past fiscal year, Harvard invested $191 million in undergraduate financial aid. That path to a debt-free college education, open to every student at the College, is enabled by the endowment that Mr. Gonzalez seeks to tax by more than $550 million in the first year.
Mr. Gonzalez also inaccurately labels nonprofit status as a “subsidy” and fails to recognize the financial and programmatic impacts of colleges and universities at the local level. Harvard pays taxes on property it owns that is not used for academic purposes and has a long tradition of making voluntary payments-in-lieu-of taxes to its host communities. In the last decade, payments to the cities of Boston and Cambridge alone totaled more than $177 million and are complemented by hundreds of mission-based community benefit programs.
Colleges and universities are tax exempt for a reason. They expand knowledge, not for commercial gain, but for the benefit of society by making possible new discoveries, spawning new companies and creating new jobs. The medical breakthroughs, the scientific innovation, the museums, and community programs that are abundant throughout our region are testament to a deliberate policy. This is exactly why China, for example, is heavily investing in higher education, recognizing that it is a proven way to advance their economy and create better lives for their citizens. This proposed endowment tax would be a step back and would directly undermine Massachusetts’ strong higher education sector and all that it enables.
Thomas J. Hollister is the University's Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a series of gauche emails lately appearing in my inbox, Sex Week began on Sunday. I have long thought the name of this carnival deceptive: If it meant that the student body was henceforth going to confine its illicit activities to a single week of the year, that would be a vast improvement over the present situation.
Alas, no. Instead it means that a few dozen Harvard affiliates will occasionally convene in Sever or Emerson to display their “sex positivity” under the tutelage of people with Ph.D.s in made-up subjects.
I confess that when I was a freshman my reaction to these emails was surprise at their shamelessness, but this year I am more prone to wondering whether Sex Week is the result of true nymphomania or merely lack of diverting reading material. Shock, as all radicals know, wears off quickly, so the desire épater le bourgeois urges them to bolder and bolder excesses until — what seems the next logical step — Harvard begins sponsoring a week of learning about how to have sex.
Or rather, learning about how not to have sex. The whole program of Sex Week promotes the punctilious observance of methods and practices designed specifically to replace sex with grotesque approximations. Indeed the only inappropriate thing one could say at these events would be that sexual relations and childbearing are in any way connected.
After all, when somebody declares in grave tones that I need protection, my first thought is “From what?” The marital act does not strike me as a battle to be undertaken only when heavily armed. The sexual revolution has persuaded Americans that in sex they encounter a problem that can be solved only by the revolution’s own merchandise. It has invented an enemy in order to sell weapons. In most aspects of life, that is called fraud; in sex, it is called liberation.
The subject matter of the various events during these eight days ranges from the repulsive to the stupid. What, for instance, are we to make of “Like a Virgin: Exploring the Concept of Virginity”? The entire civilized world has had that concept down pat for several thousand years, and one doubts the reliability of a lecture based exclusively on second-hand sources. Most of the other events advertise little more than the fact that Sex Weekers and good puns exist in total estrangement.
I suppose amateurism is to be expected from amateurs, even the most devoted, so the orchestrators have enlisted the help of the professionals, Planned Parenthood and Good Vibrations. As regards the first, we have another misleading name: One expects this to be a group of vocation counselors advising marriage for those who plan to be parents but are not aware of how that result is achieved. No again — it is a Margaret Sanger fan club that found forced sterilization an outdated barbarism and so adopted abortion as a more modern one.
The other organization, however, admits no double entendre. Since the Crass Menagerie took up residence on JFK St. (where it is, by present standards, only the second weirdest establishment, the Curious George store being the first), it has grown less and less interesting, capable now only of intruding impotently in undergraduate perversion and of being easily confused with the bong shop next door.
The assistance of both companies at this teenage onanist coagulation is, at any rate, amusing. I had not thought that distributing electrified tchotchkes to college students would be a fulfilling career choice, but if it turned out that Sex Week was merely an elaborate charade to disguise a networking event for Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrators facing unemployment, my eyebrows would remain level.
One day soon, perhaps, we will have Purity Week, wherein the lascivious revolutionaries might be taught decency and virtue, or even T.M.I. Week, during which no events will be held. Meanwhile, we shall have to endure the sound of faraway ululations, which politeness will ascribe to World Series euphoria.

Look, I get it. Voting is important. From the upcoming Harvard Undergraduate Council elections to the national midterms, hourly emails remind me that I’ve got to perform my civic duty. (Though, I’m not sure the Mather House get-out-the-vote zealots would be so eager to provide me free stamps to mail my Colorado ballot if they realized it might not necessarily be part of the alleged “blue wave.”) Inbox fatigue and jaded cynicism aside, I do believe casting a vote is a critical function of civilian civic duty.
In all kinds of election cycles, the creative energy and “do-something” impulses of ambitious office-seekers never cease to astound me, especially at the campus level. Gosh darn it, all of Harvard’s intrepid UC president and vice-presidential candidates have so many things they want to do for students, and by golly there they’re the ones who will do them best. Another Crimson columnist has already written a delightful piece about the quixotic quest of indistinguishable UC candidate platforms, so I won’t subject them to additional satirical scrutiny.
I am genuinely glad that there are students who want to lead and serve Harvard in this way, but I would pose the following question to these candidates: What would you take away? So many campus organizational efforts seem additive in nature, whether a resource to be created, a supportive administrative post to be established, or another initiative to be funded. Such efforts make for great slogans and hashtags, and no one wants to be the villain that doesn’t want more “resources” and “support” for anything even mildly relevant or important. Yet, is it possible that there are programs or initiatives that can be struck?
This is not to say that student government, other student leaders, or University administrators shouldn’t pursue creative and innovative solutions to problems. But we need to think hard about our tendencies to generate constant institutional growth to solve problems. If we think that improving the student condition can only be done by more programming, more training, more online modules, more administrative resources — just more in general — then we will only become more entrapped in increasingly unwieldy bureaucratic machinery.
We don’t have to look much further than our tuition bills to see part of the real cost of adding more cogs and wheels to the machine. Research from the American Institutes for Research estimates that the number of non-academic administrators and professional employees at American colleges has more than doubled over the past 25 years, far outpacing increases in student or faculty attendance. The College Board reports that tuition and fees have doubled or even tripled at public universities over roughly the same time period.
Now, as any good statistician or economist knows, correlation does not equal causation. But it is far from unlikely that no relationship exists between bureaucratic expansion and rising tuition. While the forces driving that expansion certainly can’t be solely attributed to student efforts, demands for more resources, and simply more stuff, students play a non-negligible role in perpetuating a culture that is often ignorant of the realities of scarcity.
As a good friend remarked to me over dinner once, I also wonder if our striving for “more” can be destructive to fostering community. There are two possible arguments here: The generation of more programming, initiatives, groups, etc. (while not intrinsically bad) has a dispersive effect on the student body, in the sense that students scatter to ever more niche and varied outlets for their interests and zeal. Again, that’s not intrinsically a bad thing, but it seems to me that the more we extend ourselves outward in such a way, the weaker our connections become to what anchors us to our larger community. Second, it is simply a fact of scarcity that all of our efforts necessarily compete with each other to some extent, which can foster discord and division.
But scarcity is far from salient at most American universities, especially at Harvard. It is easy for us to promise resources and funding for all kinds of initiatives and organizations because most of the time, we can actually get it all. The belief that we can have it all seems is woven deep into the Harvard psyche, as we fill up the Google calendar with endless blocks of class, extracurriculars, sports, job-seeking, and what not. However, every Harvard student knows intimately well the personal cost of this belief.
Perhaps it is because we as a student body and society are so stressed and burdened by the destructive scarcity of time that electoral promises of resources and initiatives and creative impulses become such sweet sounds to our ears, such attractive platforms for campaigns of all levels. As I cast my absentee midterm ballot and look towards the UC elections, I know that there likely won’t be many calls for any kind of resource prioritization, audit of spending, or meaningful consideration of ever-expanding administrative machinery. We will still inevitably be drawn to the promise of more, and to doing more ourselves at some cost. What will it take to convince ourselves that sometimes, less is more?

Panelists discussed the future of democracy in Europe at a Center for European Studies summit Monday.
The annual event, entitled “Summit on the Future of Europe,” provides a forum for scholars and public leaders to discuss the condition of Europe and its people. Migration, rising populism, and other topics were debated throughout the day-long conference.
In the second panel of the day, speakers diagnosed a rising tide of authoritarianism as challenging democratic ideals.
“Today, the values that make up the European Union are in danger of being replaced by an emphasis on identity,” Ayse Kadioglu, CES visiting scholar and chair of the panel, said.
CES Director Grzegorz Ekiert discussed the declining quality of Poland’s and Hungary’s democratic institutions.
“For the first time in the history of European Union, we have two countries [Hungary and Poland], two member states, which are formally charged with assault under rule of law, and we have two countries which breached the fundamental European values,” he said.
He specifically referenced a photograph of Polish governing officials next to the fascist flag and the rise of anti-semitism and nationalism in Hungary as evidence of this trend.
Other panelists sought to describe the sources of these sentiments.
“The main problem of the European Union right now is migration. Rule of law, values, justice, they matter but not like migration,” said panelist Monica Macovei, a member of the European Parliament from Romania.
Macovei characterized some of the responses to the European Union’s controverial package deal for immigration — which required EU members to allow a certain number of immigrants into their countries — as xenophobic.
“The cause of this is populism and nationalism, which are the tools of extremism,” she said.
Some panelists also drew parallels between the political climate in Europe and in the United States.
“I sit before you as a transatlantic phenomenon,” said John Shattuck, a professor of diplomacy at Tufts University. Shattuck mentioned the connections between President Trump and other populistic leaders, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary.
“Trump, as you know, reached out to Orbán, and Orbán was one of the first people to congratulate him on his election,” Shattuck said. “Trump is, in some ways, following the Orbán playbook in the way he is operating in the United States.”
Panelist Karen Donfried, a senior fellow at CES, said politics overseas are very relevant to people living in the United States, including students.
“I think there’s a critical role for students in your generation to play in this,” she said. “Because it’s not just the policymakers and the heads of state of government that effect these political trends — it’s citizens, and each of us has agency in this.”
Robert Rosenberg, a policy advisor who attended the conference, said the forum was a necessary step towards change.
“The talks and discussions were very important for the future of the global countries,” he said. “Discussing these issues is where you start to formulate the solutions.”

An elderly woman was punched in the back of the head after getting on a Red Line train car at the Harvard Square station on Friday, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority police announced.
The assault occurred at rush hour, when the 71 year-old female stepped from the Harvard stop into a crowded car, according to an article tweeted by MBTA Transit Police. With all of the seats in the car taken, the victim saw another female, identified as 23-year-old Boston resident Jada Campbell, occupying one seat with her purse on the adjacent seat.
According to the MBTA Transit Police Department website, the victim “politely asked Campbell to hold her purse so the seat could free up and the victim could sit down.” Campbell refused, and when the victim handed her the purse and began to sit down, Campbell threatened to physically harm the victim. The elderly woman began to move away, fearing for her safety, when Campbell struck her in the back of the head with a closed fist. Campbell then began threatening witnesses who alerted transit police to the situation.
After a “struggle,” police arrested Campbell on charges of assault and battery on a person over 60, intimidation of a witness, and resisting arrest. She was then taken to transit police headquarters for booking.
MBTA Superintendent Richard Sullivan spoke out against the assault at the Harvard MBTA station.
“We are judged as a society by how we treat our most vulnerable citizens, our children and our elders,” Sullivan wrote in an emailed statement.
“This was a disgusting display of violence,” he wrote. “It is our sincere hope Campbell's arrest will serve notice, behavior such as this or any acts of violence on the MBTA will will not be tolerated.”
Sullivan also wrote the MBTA will work with the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office to “ensure Campbell is held accountable for her egregious conduct.”
The transit police website noted that all events remain allegations at this stage. “All defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” the statement reads.
This is not the first incident on the Red Line this fall. In September, a 66-year-old man was struck and killed by a train at Porter Square station.

Harvard may be required to change its current Title IX policy to comply with new federal dictates if the U.S. Department of Education publishes a new set of guidelines under consideration, experts say.
The new draft guidelines would require schools to allow students accused of sexual assault to cross-examine their accusers, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. They are aimed at shaping implementation of Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law that underpins universities’ approach to handling sexual assault.
A 2011 Dear Colleague letter that first set federal recommendations for campus sexual assault adjudication stated that the Office for Civil Rights — a subset of the Department of Education — “strongly discourages schools from allowing the parties personally to question or cross-examine each other” during hearings, since this “may be traumatic or intimidating, thereby possibly escalating or perpetuating a hostile environment.”
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded that Obama-era letter in Sept. 2017.
Colby Bruno, a lawyer with the Victim Rights Law Center, wrote that allowing cross-examination by the accused could be “seriously traumatizing for the accuser.”
“Survivors face many obstacles to reporting and disclosing. These new guidelines would create more obstacles for them to report and be safe. Sadly, that seems to be exactly what the Department of Education’s goals are,” Bruno wrote in an email.
A spokesperson for the Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment.
“The whole logic for these guidelines comes out of this belief among the Trump administration that there’s this huge false accusation problem, and that’s just really not the case,” said Remedy H. Ryan ’21, a member of campus anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better.
The new guidelines “would just make the complaint process more difficult for survivors,” she added.
Harvard Law School Professor Diane L. Rosenfeld, who teaches a course on Title IX, speculated that the leaked draft guidelines “could likely change” from their current iteration, after the required notice-and-comment period. That portion of the regulatory process allows the public to provide feedback on changes to rules executive agencies propose.
“Many of the things that are in the policy are legally very problematic,” Rosenfeld said. “They seek to import private law standards and criminal justice standards into a civil rights context for school adjudication under Title IX. And they’re just simply not the same legal and regulatory system, so the same rules don’t apply.”
Rosenfeld also said the Department of Education is legally obligated to take all comments into account while the guidelines are open for notice-and-comment.
When the department issues them in final form, however, Harvard might need to change its procedures for adjudicating sexual misconduct complaints. Under the University’s current procedures for investigating formal complaints, investigators interview complainants and respondents separately.
Asked whether Harvard would change its policy if the draft guidelines take effect, University spokesperson Nate Herpich wrote in an email, “It would be premature for us to respond at this time, as no changes have been made as of yet.”
The Trump administration’s stance on Title IX also provoked uproar last month, when the New York Times reported that the administration was considering codifying a definition of gender in Title IX that would effectively define transgender people out of existence.
In its current form, the new set of Department of Education guidelines does not contain a definition of gender. Instead, the U.S. Department of Justice is exploring the option of issuing a legal opinion that would restrict determinations of gender to a person’s genitals at birth, the Wall Street Journal reported.
In an Oct. 30 interview, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Harvard remains committed to its “policy of inclusion” and “non-discrimination.”
“We don't know what policy changes there's going to be yet,” Bacow said, adding that Harvard’s commitment to inclusion “will not change.”
“We will see what the administration does, but we're committed to our policy,” he said.
In an email to undergraduates last week, Director of BGLTQ Student Life Sheehan D. Scarborough wrote that though it is uncertain as to whether this change will pass, the College will continue to support transgender and gender non-binary students.
“The existence of transgender and gender non-binary people is not hypothetical or abstract, nor should it be up for debate. You have a right to live without fear, to be visible, and to thrive. Harvard College’s position on this matter will not change,” Scarborough wrote.
“Our current non-discrimination policy includes protections on the basis of sex and gender identity, and we affirm and celebrate the diversity of gender identities and expressions represented in our community,” he added.
University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said that since the University adopted its current sexual- and gender-based harassment policy in 2014, it has consistently “gone beyond” federal Title IX guidelines.
“We’ve incorporated provisions that prohibit discrimination not only on the basis of sex, but sexual orientation and gender identity. And it’s our intent to uphold those values of inclusivity in the Harvard community,” she said.

For 58 years after its establishment, Harvard’s Statistics Department — known for being a small, scholarly community of a few dozen researchers sequestered on the seventh floor of the Science Center — did not have a single female tenured faculty member.
That picture has changed dramatically over the past ten years, as the department has transformed to accommodate a skyrocketing number of undergraduate concentrators and a rising awareness of gender representation in the sciences.
About a quarter of today’s tenured Statistics faculty is female, a development that administrators, professors, and alumni see as a sea-change from the department of decades past.
Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, who received her PhD in Statistics from Harvard in 1983, said the Statistics department was “very, very much gender-imbalanced for decades.”
“This was a department that always had female graduate students but never had female faculty, ever,” Singer said.
Singer attributed the imbalance to the small size of the department and a conspicuous lack of undergraduate concentrators in its early years.
“I think the more striking trend is that there are undergraduates who are concentrating and taking classes in statistics,” Singer said. “When I was a PhD student, if there was an undergraduate around, that was an unusual phenomenon.”
Professor Xihong Lin, who holds a joint appointment in the Statistics Department and the Biostatistics Department at the School of Public Health, said that peer departments at Stanford and UC Berkeley have historically had larger statistics programs. As recently as 2008, the Harvard Statistics Department had fewer than 20 undergraduate concentrators. Today, that number has increased more than seven-fold.
Remembering her time as a graduate student in the department, Singer said she has seen an evolution in attitudes towards gender representation among faculty over the years. She shared an anecdote about Frederick Mosteller, who was the founding chair of the Statistics Department and her own PhD advisor.
“Fred was actually a wonderful man who gave opportunities to women, but it was just not a department that could see its way to diversifying its faculty effectively,” Singer said.
She pointed to a moment during a reception in Loeb House to celebrate Mosteller’s retirement in 1987. The former Chair had introduced his wife to attendees with an off-hand joke that Singer — at the time, one of only a few women in Statistics — still remembers clearly.
“He said, ‘every statistician needs a wife,’” Singer recalled, to which an alumus of the department interjected, “Fred, some of us are wives.”
According to Interim Dean of Sciences Christopher W. Stubbs, one of Harvard administrators’ main objectives when hiring new faculty members is to maximize representation across the faculty body and ensure that students “can see people that look and feel like them in the classroom.”
“Every step along the way in the [hiring] process... the administration is looking over the shoulder of these [faculty] searches as they’re executed and making sure that they’re meeting our broad educational objectives,” Stubbs said.
He lauded the efforts of former Dean of Sciences Jeremy Bloxham — who stepped down at the end of the 2017-2018 academic year — in bringing the tenure-track faculty of the Sciences division to gender parity through a series of appointments that included the hiring of Statistics Professor Susan A. Murphy in 2017.
According to Singer, collaboration between Statistics faculty and senior Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators, including former FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, was instrumental in reducing the department’s gender imbalance. Singer particularly noted the work of former Statistics Department Chair Neil Shephard in promoting diversity within the faculty population of the department.
Singer said one effective mechanism adopted by Shephard was the extension of full-time equivalent appointments to faculty with tenured positions elsewhere at Harvard, which gave them voting rights and participation in the department. She named Lin and Statistics Professor Xiaole “Shirley” Liu, who both also serve as Biostatistics professors at then School of Public Health, as examples of recent full-time equivalent appointments that increased the gender diversity of the department
“By extending our appointments to Professor Lin and Professor Liu, all of a sudden there were two tenured women in the department,” Singer said.
Singer noted that these “FTE” appointments enabled the Statistics Department to increase female faculty representation more quickly than recruiting and hiring from outside the university.
Lin cited support from FAS and University officials as a key factor to increasing the number of female faculty members in the department.
“From the leadership and to the faculty in the department, everybody feels that promoting diversity is one of the department’s higher priorities,” she said.
According to Lin, this “team effort” has resulted in an “intellectual environment that is stimulating, supportive, and nurturing.” She said the senior faculty care about the junior faculty and often discuss ways to help the junior faculty develop their careers and make more connections.
Stubbs said there is still room for improvement, however. While he acknowledged that progress in reducing gender imbalances in traditionally male-dominated departments like Statistics has been “depressingly slow,” he said he is committed to addressing this challenge during his time as Interim Dean of Sciences.
“I think it’s incumbent on all of us to think hard about what more can we do,” he said. “I’ll certainly do everything that I can while I’m sitting in this chair to bring about that change.”
In addition to recruiting female faculty members, professors are also aiming to bridge the gender disparity among undergraduate concentrators through improving the quality of instruction.
Singer attributed the origin of this effort to Statistics Professor and former Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng, who chaired the Statistics Department from 2004 to 2012. Meng’s ideas marked a “profound shift” and are part of the reason why the department had expanded so quickly, according to Singer.
“When Meng was chair, he believed that the key to success in the department was to improve the quality of teaching in the department, to make taking courses and to make being a concentrator an attractive option. And if we made it an attractive option, we would also attract more women into the field,” Singer said. “So improving the climate and the attention to teaching in the department generally saw an increase in enrollment, an increase in concentrators, an emphasis in teaching.”
Both Stubbs and Lin pointed to burgeoning undergraduate interest in Statistics classes. Lin mentioned, in particular, Statistics Professor Joseph K. Blitzstein’s popular course Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” which currently boasts 542 enrolled students.
“The Statistics Department is a remarkable department in that the number of students per year that take courses in statistics is around 2,500,” Stubbs said. “Of all the departments in our division, I believe it’s the case that Statistics carries the biggest instructional load per faculty member of any department in our division.”
Stubbs added that the “growing appreciation of data science” and its interdisciplinary applications have caused what he called a “tsunami of demand” for statistics courses.
According to Singer, the faculty’s diverse research areas reflect the versatility of statistics for use in other fields. Many Statistics professors have joint appointments in other departments.
“There’s a very famous quote from a fellow named John Tukey, who was actually the unofficial PhD advisor of my advisor: ‘One of the fun things about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard,’” Singer said.
Several undergraduates in the department said that while they notice continued gender disparities, they are cognizant of the department’s ongoing efforts to address them.
Kelsang D. Donyo ’19, a Statistics concentrator, said the gender imabalance among Statistics faculty was particularly noticeable in upper-level statistics courses, but paralleled trends in other STEM departments.
“When you go in the upper-level classes, like Stat 139 or Stat 149, it does tend to get more male-dominated,” she said. “But at the same time you sort of expect that, sadly, as a student concentrating in Statistics, or taking those statistics courses, or math courses, or CS courses, and we just get trained to be used to that.”
Donyo said she believed the department could do more to promote diversity in concentration advising and mentorship, rather than relying on student-run advocacy groups such as Gender Inclusivity in Mathematics.
“It would be nice to have a female voice to kind of help you navigate certain job opportunities after graduation, in terms of more technical roles,” Donyo said. “It’s more like you as a Statistics concentrator have to speak out, maybe find a female mentor figure on your own, rather than that being provided for you.”
Tejal Patwardhan ’20, a Statistics concentrator and a teaching fellow for Stat 110, acknowledged the “pretty significant disparity” in the gender composition of faculty members and concentrators in the department. Still, she said she felt faculty members were “very aware” of this issue and taking active steps to address it.
In particular, Patwardhan pointed to Blitzstein’s efforts to diversify the teaching staff of Stat 110 through the hiring of more female teaching fellows. She said this was especially encouraging to potential female concentrators — given the course’s role as an introduction to the concentration — and guided her own decision to concentrate in Statistics.
“When I took the class and I saw a lot of women TFs who were very brilliant, that made me want to join,” Patwardhan said.
Similarly, Allison R. Paul ’20 said that the encouragement and support she received from professors was a significant factor in her decision to concentrate in Statistics.
“I started off wanting to do pure math, and in freshman year I got kind of turned off from it when I was taking [Math] 55,” Paul said. “At the same time, I was taking Stat 110, and Joe Blitzstein emailed me, saying ‘hey, you should really think about being a Stat concentrator!’ And I really appreciated that and have since really liked Stat. And Blitzstein is my advisor right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Voters across the nation will cast their ballots Tuesday to determine the country’s next round of political leaders in a midterm election increasingly framed as a referendum on President Donald Trump. Around 36 million people across the nation have already voted – making for what appears to be a high-turnout election, especially among younger voters.
Democrats have their eyes set on the House of Representatives, which they hope to take back after losing control of the chamber in 2010. One key issue this election cycle is immigration; Trump intensified his rhetoric around the issue in recent days in what appears to be a bid to mobilize Republican voters.
Cambridge residents can cast their votes in the 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. in one of 29 local polling places, including Quincy House, one of the 12 undergraduate residential Houses on Harvard’s campus.
Massachusetts voters can confirm their voter registration and polling location online. Anyone who is having trouble voting can contact the Cambridge Election Commission at 617-349-4361 (for Cambridge voters only) or the national Voter Protection Hotline at 866-OUR-VOTE (for voters anywhere in the country).

Harvard Votes Challenge leaders at the Institute of Politics said some Harvard students incorrectly registered to vote using their campus mailing addresses instead of their residential dormitory addresses. If, when you check your voter status online, you show up as not registered — and if you submitted your registration forms before the voter registration deadline — you will be permitted to correct your registration on Tuesday. Affected students can request a provisional ballot when they go to their polling location.
The IOP has compiled a chart of assigned polling locations for each Harvard undergraduate residential House and dormitory.
Several key legislative positions are contested in this years midterms. Here's what you need to know.
Wildly popular incumbent Democrat Elizabeth Warren is, per several polls, safely in the lead to maintain her seat in the U.S. Senate. After winning an unopposed primary, Warren faces Republican challenger Geoff Diehl in Tuesday’s general election. Diehl, who won the endorsement from the Massachusetts Republican Party, is known primarily for his support of President Donald Trump; he was co-chair of Massachusetts’s effort to elect the current president. Currently, polls say male voters in Massachusetts are roughly split between the two candidates, while female voters overwhelmingly support Warren.
As in the primary, self-proclaimed “inventor of email” Shiva Ayyadurai is running as an independent candidate. His campaign has proven controversial for his tactics against Warren, whom he calls a “fake Indian.” Polls suggest Ayyadurai is unlikely to win.
Ranked as America’s “most popular” governor, incumbent Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 is the favorite to win reelection. Often called a moderate Republican, Baker has garnered a 74 percent approval rating in a traditionally blue state, the highest of any governor in the nation according to a poll conducted by WBUR radio station and a Massachusetts-based think tank.
Baker, who is running on a ticket with incumbent Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, will face Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jay Gonzalez in the Tuesday election. Gonzalez previously served as the budget chief for former Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and as CEO of healthcare company CeltiCare. Polls show Gonzalez trailing Baker by a significant margin. His campaign ruffled feathers with a controversial university endowment tax proposal which would cost Harvard over $500 million per year. He defended the proposal in a recent op-ed for The Crimson.
Gonzalez has received the endorsement of former President Barack Obama. He will run on a ticket with Quentin A. Palfrey ’96, who is the son of Adams House Faculty Deans John “Sean” G. Palfrey ’67 and Judith “Judy” S. Palfrey ’67.
After running unopposed in the Sept. 4 primary, popular incumbent Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, a Democrat, will face Republican attorney James R. McMahon III on Tuesday. Healey was first elected to office in 2014, and is expected to keep her position in the upcoming term.
Following an unusually competitive primary election, Democratic incumbent Secretary of State William F. Galvin is seeking a ninth term in office. He will face Republican candidate and current head of security and chief investigator at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Anthony M. Amore.
Massachusetts’s congressional delegation is currently made up entirely of Democrats running for re-election, with the exception of one retiring member.
After pulling a stunning primary upset against incumbent Democratic Rep. Michael E. Capuano, Ayanna S. Pressley is poised to win in Massachusetts’s 7th Congressional District, which includes parts of Harvard’s campus on the Boston side of the river.
Meanwhile, incumbent Democratic Rep. Katherine M. Clark will face Republican challenger John Hugo in Massachusetts’s 5th Congressional District, which includes Harvard’s main Cambridge campus.
There are also three ballot questions on slate for Tuesday’s election. See our primer here for a rundown of these initiatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When voters head to the polls Tuesday to cast ballots in the 2018 midterm elections, they may not be thinking about Harvard.
But the way they vote could have serious reverberations in Cambridge. Ranging from taxes on its $39.2 billion endowment to the immigration status of its undocumented students and workers to the survival of its controversial social group sanctions, the University has a large stake in the outcome of this year’s midterms.
In the run-up to Tuesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has been busy lobbying legislators to keep Harvard’s interests in mind. He’s traveled to Washington, made a series of phone calls to prominent lawmakers, and met with VIPs around the country.
As he lobbies Congress, Bacow has kept three main Harvard interests at the top of his mind. The Crimson breaks down what they are — and how the midterms could affect each one.
One of the president’s top lobbying priorities is convincing legislators to repeal a recently passed tax on Harvard’s endowment.
Enacted during the 2017 Republican tax overhaul, the legislation requires Harvard and other institutions with endowments greater than $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent excise tax on endowment returns. The tax — which will take effect for the 2019 fiscal year — would have cost Harvard $43 million in 2017, according to University estimates.
Soon after taking office, Bacow journeyed to Washington, D.C. to persuade legislators that the endowment tax will not accomplish their stated goal of making college more affordable. In an interview last month, Bacow said the tax will not only increase the cost of higher education but will also make it harder to raise money for financial aid.
“I try to explain to them why I think this is lousy public policy,” Bacow said of his lobbying efforts in another interview last week. “At least those that I’ve talked to seem to be quite receptive to the arguments that I’m making.”
“Whether or not that results in changes in the law will depend upon both the outcome of the elections and what gets introduced as legislation in the next Congress,” he added.
So, how could the midterms affect the tax?
The vast majority of Democrats oppose the endowment tax and prominent party leaders including Sen. Elizabeth Warren have spoken out against it. If Democrats earn the 23 seats necessary to regain control of the House of Representatives Tuesday, Bacow’s goal of rescinding the Republican-backed tax is probably one step closer towards reality.
A Washington Post-ABC news poll released Sunday showed Democrats in the lead in the battle to retake the House by seven percentage points.
Though he has not returned to Washington since his first trip, Bacow recently met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at Harvard to discuss immigration — another issue high on his list of University concerns.
Bacow said he and Pelosi spoke about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status, two Obama-era policies meant to protect undocumented youth and adults. Almost immediately after taking office, President Donald Trump began rolling back these programs — and hasn’t let up since. He repealed DACA in Sept. 2017 — though courts have since challenged his decision — and curtailed TPS, suspending it for individuals from certain countries, in Jan. 2018.
In a January interview, Harvard spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson said the Trump administration’s efforts to curb TPS will affect “several dozen” workers at Harvard. The school had roughly 65 undocumented affiliates in 2017.
Students and staff have called on Bacow to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Drew G. Faust, by publicly advocating for the continuation of DACA and TPS.
“I made a number of statements in my inaugural address about the importance of continuing to be open as a country to those who seek freedom and opportunity, as well as to those who would like to come to Harvard to study and to work,” Bacow said in an interview last week.
Bacow isn’t talking only to Pelosi. The president said he has also spoken to other members of Congress about immigration in meetings held in Cambridge, on phone calls, and throughout his travels across the United States. Though he declined to name those legislators, Bacow said they hail from “both sides of the aisle.”
If Democrats take the House, Bacow’s stated mission — protecting Harvard affiliates eligible for DACA and TPS — could get easier.
Pelosi has said protecting DACA beneficiaries is a legislative priority. Some analysts have suggested that, if the midterms usher in a blue wave, the Democrats could seek to trade DACA or an expanded version of DACA for Trump’s long-promised border wall.
And, though Democrats cannot overturn Trump’s executive orders, a Democrat-dominated House could take steps to aggressively scrutinize the administration’s DACA and TPS policy shakeups, among other things.
Tuesday’s election could also reshape the fate of Harvard’s controversial sanctions on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
The penalties, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, the captaincies of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes. But a bill dubbed the PROSPER Act could imperil Harvard’s ability to enforce its sanctions.
The PROSPER Act, a revision of the Higher Education Act, includes a provision that could bar the University from penalizing students who join single-gender social groups. If it passes, Harvard might be forced to choose between its sanctions and millions of dollars in federal funding.
But it’s probably not going to pass, experts say — and a blue wave would only decrease the bill’s shot at becoming law.
Democrats are unlikely to support the PROSPER Act, which Republicans proposed in the first place. Even for Republicans, the bill is not a top priority, analysts say.
The amendment related to social groups is just one of many provisions contained in the bill. Others include acts that could limit some students’ ability to pay for college.
The House Committee on Education and the Workforce voted the bill out of committee in December 2017. Legislators have yet to schedule it for discussion on the House floor.
Former University President Drew G. Faust that in a May interview that Bacow would be "very much focused” on the reauthorizton of the act.
Bacow said in an interview last week that the PROSPER Act will likely fail to pass in Congress, though he noted that alterations to the “form” of the bill may change that.
“There will be a new bill introduced in the next Congress and we’ll take a look on what’s in that new bill,” Bacow said. “There will be a new Congress.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Higher education fundraising experts are divided over whether the Harvard admissions lawsuit will impact donations — though some big-ticket donors say the litigation won’t change their giving patterns.
Harvard’s high-profile admissions trial wrapped up in a Boston federal courtroom Friday after 15 days of argument. The trial was the latest development in a four-year-old lawsuit filed by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, which alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
Whichever way Judge Allison D. Burroughs rules, the losing party plans to appeal the verdict — likely all the way to the Supreme Court. With conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh now on the bench, experts predict the court could strike down affirmative action in college admissions entirely.
The lawsuit has revealed many once-hidden details about how Harvard admits students. Among other revelations, documents released in court showed that the University gives significant admissions preferences to children of wealthy donors. These applicants — whom the College places into two selective groups dubbed the “dean’s list” and “director’s list” — see an acceptance rate nine times higher than the overall rate.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview last week he could not quantify the donations Harvard receives from alumni whose children benefited from these admissions preferences.
“I honestly don’t know the answer to that and, even if I did, I probably couldn’t say it right now given that the case is in trial,” he said.
Asked whether Harvard has seen an uptick in donations in light of this revelation, University President Lawrence S. Bacow again declined to comment.
“I couldn’t tell you,” he said.
Bacow said that he does not receive frequent updates on donations.
“It’s not as if we monitor donations on daily basis,” he said. “I don’t get a daily report. Or a weekly report. Or a monthly report.”
Higher education expert Thomas D. Parker '64 said elite universities have always given children from wealthy backgrounds an edge in their admissions processes — partly to sustain their donor base.
“There’s a reason that Harvard is one of the best places in the world and that's because it has a lot of money. And one of the reasons it has a lot of money is that it has been very very successful at private fundraising,” he said. “And part of that success has to do with not just admitting legacies, but admitting rich people.”
“These aren’t revelations that are coming out of this,” he added, referring to the lawsuit.
Robert Moore, an executive at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, said it is too early to predict the effect the lawsuit may have on giving. He also said he is unsure how Harvard’s development team will talk about the lawsuit with donors.
“We also don’t know in the end what the Harvard development staff is going to do as they start to talk to donors,” he said. “It’s a dimensional relationship that is developed over some years.”
Moore pointed to other schools involved in controversies that have bounced back from negative perceptions — though he noted he “cannot project” if the same will hold true for Harvard.
“If you think about alumni, alumni know the institution and they know its faults,” he said. “And maybe a controversy like this brings some of those faults to the fore, but they also know with greater depth the real qualities of the institution. And if they believe in the institution, then what they will want to know is how is the institution responding to this challenge.”
Parker raised the point that a Supreme Court ruling striking down Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policy may actually boost donations if Harvard opts to defy the ruling and keep its admissions process, risking federal funding.
Parker speculated that this string of events might motivate donors to give to the University to offset the loss of federal funds. But, he added, it would be tricky to make up the hundreds of millions of dollars per year Harvard receives from the government.
Michael T. Kerr '81, a former co-chair of the Harvard College Fund Executive Committee, said he anticipated the lawsuit will have no effect on current donors, since many of the alumni support the school’s efforts to diversify its student population.
“I don’t think it’s going to affect as things stand now,” Kerr said. “I don’t think the school’s relationship with its alumni will be affected by the trial, because I think most of the alumni I know broadly, broadly support having a diverse student body.”
Asked whether the lawsuit against Harvard would change his giving to the University, Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, a former Crimson editor and a former member of the Board of Overseers, answered “not at all.” Buttenwieser also said other donors have told him they plan to stick to their current patterns of giving.
“Everybody I have talked to feels that Harvard’s admissions policy is great, Dean Fitzsimmons... [has] brought about much more diversity than Harvard has ever known, all the donors I know are very much in favor of diversity and we see this lawsuit as a challenge to diversity,” Buttenwieser said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School faculty, instructors, and research associates donated overwhelmingly to Democratic candidates, political action committees, and causes in both the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, according to data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Nearly 92 percent of all political donations from HKS affiliates in 2016 and 2018 went to Democrats. Roughly 4.3 percent of the money donated went to Republicans while less than 1 percent to Independent candidates. The rest of the contributions — about 3.6 percent — went to non-profits or nonpartisan groups.
This election cycle, though, saw a slight decrease in the amount of money faculty donated to both major parties. HKS faculty donated $84,030 to Democratic candidates and organizations in 2016, compared to the $79,670 it gave to Democrats in 2018. The trend held true for Republican candidates, too. School affiliates donated $1,700 less to Republican candidates and organizations in 2018 as compared to 2016.
The data — which the Center for Responsive Politics compiled at The Crimson’s request — accounted only for individuals who listed the Kennedy School as their employer at the time of their donation. The center took its information from publicly available Federal Election Commission filings.
Kennedy School affiliates’ preference for Democratic candidates fits the recent national trend in which Democrats are out-fundraising their Republican opponents. According to the Washington Post, Democratic candidates had raised more money than their Republican opponents in 53 of the 73 most competitive congressional races as of Oct. 2018.
The FEC data shows that HKS faculty contributed less frequently to individual candidates or political parties in the 2018 election cycle than they did in the 2016 cycle. This time around, Kennedy School professors instead gave more money to nonprofits and political action committees.
In 2016, 110 donations totaling more than $88,000 went to candidates or party funds. In 2018, 94 donations — $83,170 dollars in total — went to candidates or parties.
Roughly 24 donations in 2018 went to political action committees, compared to 2 donations in 2016. The 2018 election cycle also saw a $5,500 increase in the amount given to nonpartisan PACs or nonprofits.
Across both election cycles, most of the donations came from a relatively small group of HKS professors, researchers, and center associates. Twenty HKS affiliates contributed to political organizations or candidates in 2016, while 17 did the same in 2018.
Kennedy School professors’ liberal bent matches that of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s flagship faculty.
FAS professors have donated to Democrats by a wide margin since 2015, according to a Crimson analysis of FEC filings. A 2018 Crimson survey of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences later showed that 38.3 percent of respondents identify as “very liberal” and 44.9 percent identify as “liberal.” 
Kennedy School Professor Emeritus Christopher S. Jencks, who donated $59,650 to Democrats and $500 to Independents between 2016 and 2018, said he gave “buckets of money” to the Democrats — but not because he “loves” the party. He shelled out because he strongly disapproves of Republicans and President Donald Trump, Jencks said in an interview.
“That's not particularly atypical for people who are contributing to the Republican party or the Democratic party,” Jencks said. “They are responding to what Trump and to what the Republican party has become, a rubber stamp for Trump.”
Ronald L. Heifetz, the co-founder of the HKS Center for Public Leadership, said the Kennedy School’s commitment to “truth” — which he said some fear Trump has imperiled — may have spurred donations to Democratic candidates.
“There is a deep commitment to finding out the truth,” Heifetz said. “The current politics that President Trump represents is a politics that's capitalizing on the erosion of trust in the society that has gone on for decades.”
Richard E. Cavanaugh, an adjunct HKS lecturer in public policy, said he chose to donate to candidates whom he knows “personally.” Cavanaugh donated $3,000 to Democratic candidates between the 2016 and 2018 elections, according to FEC filings.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an emailed statement that HKS professors are allowed to participate in politics so long as they keep their beliefs separate from their research and teaching.
“The Kennedy School does not favor any political party or endorse political candidates,” Elmendorf wrote. “However, members of the Kennedy School community, including faculty, are free to participate in the political process and exercise their rights as citizens as long as they distinguish those personal activities from their activities at the School.”
Jencks said students in his classes “have no doubt” about his political leanings. But he added he “tried desperately hard not to impose them on other people.”
“I like the theology on the left a little better than theology on the right, but I keep trying to push my students,” Jencks said. “Let's look at evidence first before you choose a side.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 237-day offseason for Harvard men’s basketball is finally over.
On Tuesday night, Lavietes Pavilion will open its doors to crosstown rival MIT as Harvard suits up for its first competitive game since bowing out of the NIT eight months ago.
Nov. 6 also marks the 127th day in office for recently-elected Harvard President Larry Bacow, who is expected to be in attendance in a clash of his two alma maters. Bacow earned his undergraduate economics degree from MIT before receiving a M.P.P., J.D. and Ph.D. at Harvard.
When asked where Bacow’s loyalties will line up, Coach Tommy Amaker wittingly expressed confidence that his heart would be with the Crimson.
“We will find out, but I do think we will have his allegiance,” Amaker proclaimed. “But he’s coming, he’s excited...with Harvard Athletics but obviously this game has special meaning in different ways for him.”
Beyond this eminent appearance, the focus now shifts to the play on the court. Counted as an exhibition in past seasons, this year’s encounter with the Engineers is a legitimate contest for both teams.
Harvard is facing an MIT team that is currently ranked fifth in Division III basketball, straight off its second consecutive NEWMAC championship in 2017-18. Coach Larry Anderson guided the Engineers to a 25-6 overall mark in his 23rd season at the helm, ultimately concluding in the Elite Eight of the DIII Tournament.
“We are going into it to see where we are and to certainly play the players and lineups that have earned opportunities to be out there,” Amaker said. “I am not going into it thinking of ‘X’ amount of minutes, as we would in an exhibition or in closed scrimmages…. We are hopeful that we are going to be ready with the bodies and personnel we have.”
The reference to overall team health is particularly salient at the dawn of the campaign, as two of Amaker’s expected starters, juniors Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns, are still recovering from offseason knee surgeries. At the Nov. 2 preseason press conference, Amaker stated he is still awaiting news from medical staff and that both Aiken and Towns would be “out indefinitely.”
In their stead, junior forward Chris Lewis will likely retain his role as the centerpiece in Amaker’s “inside-out” offense. The 2017-18 All-Ivy first team awardee averaged 12.8 points per game last season and tallied a conference-best 60.1 field goal conversion percentage. Lewis also led the Crimson in overall player efficiency and win shares, with a PER of 24.2 and WS of 3.8.
The Alpharetta, Ga., native has continued to improve his physique and looks to embrace an even larger role for Harvard this season.
“For mine, it’d be conditioning and rebounding,” Lewis said. “That’s something that me and the coaches have talked about. We think I can be more effective if I work on that, both defensively and offensively. For about the last month, I went vegetarian, multiple professional athletes have done it to get better performance. I feel a lot more energy, my body feels a lot better.”
Surrounding Lewis will be other familiar faces in the junior class, who consisted of 76 percent of total Crimson scoring in the 2017-2018 campaign. Point guard Christian Juzang will no longer need to play all 40 minutes of the game with bench reinforcements from four-star freshman Spencer Freedman and healthy senior guard Tommy McCarthy. Defensive stalwart Justin Bassey, an 8.0 PPG and 2.8 DBPM (defensive box plus/minus) contributor, will be complemented by freshman Noah Kirkwood, sophomore Rio Haskett and senior Corey Johnson at the wings.
Amaker also noted a significant improvement in sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic’s game this offseason, who will play a versatile role as a stretch big in the rotation.
“Danilo has really been one of our front-court players thus far in practice,” Amaker said.
Johnson, alongside classmate Weisner Perez, has taken over the captain’s role this year from Chris Egi ’18. The fellow Canadian also noted an emphasis on diversifying his game from his traditional spot-out shooting role, which in his three seasons at Cambridge has netted him 189 total treys at an .381 clip.
“As a captain, I need to take that leadership role to the next level,” Johnson stated. “From a game perspective, being able to create off the dribble, not just being a shooter. Defensively, be aggressive.”
On the opposing side, Harvard challenges a squad that it eclipsed by a single-digit margin in last year’s opener. The Engineers’ high scorer in the 73-64 Crimson victory, then-junior Bradley Jomard, was tabbed as a preseason DIII third team All-American after averaging a team-leading 15.5 PPG in 16 double-digit scoring performances.
Jomard will be accompanied by captain AJ Jurko, who finished his season with a 14.2 PPG and 4.7 RPG tally. The NEWMAC Tournament Most Outstanding Player has a good eye in terms of ball distribution, landing him a conference-high 158 assists last season and is a danger from deep, with a team-high 45.8 percent clip.
Coming off the bench against the Crimson, then-freshman wing Hamilton Forsythe also gave the hosts problems on defense with 13 points. The NEWMAC Rookie of the Year logged a 0.523 field goal percentage, 0.447 three-point percentage, and holds a career-high of 29 points.
With dangerous perimeter weapons, MIT will be a sure-fire test for a short-handed Crimson roster. Outside of Lewis, complementary pieces will determine whether Harvard can turn the page of the first night unscathed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until less than a month ago, senior quarterback Tom Stewart was not even starting for Harvard. A mere four weeks later, he has etched his name into the Crimson’s record books after turning in a five-touchdown performance this past Saturday in a 52-18 win over Columbia. The Dallas native overcame inclement conditions to tie the touchdown record set in 1953 by Carroll Lowenstein ’54 and matched in 2011 by Collier Winters ’12 and Colton Chapple ’13.
It was apt that Stewart’s best performance came on senior day. He managed to throw for an astounding 393 yards despite completing just 15 passes. Among those completions were the three longest touchdown passes in program history: a beautiful 92-yard strike to junior receiver Jack Cook on the first play of the game, a 75-yard pass under pressure to sophomore receiver Tyler Adams, and a 74-yard lofted pass to sophomore running back Aaron Shampklin.
All three touchdowns came during Harvard’s dominant opening quarter, after which Stewart had already racked up 251 yards passing. The Texan later slung two touchdown passes to fellow senior Henry Taylor, who racked up 105 receiving yards in addition to the two scores.
Stewart had tallied 342 passing yards by halftime and had a chance to target the all-time mark of 448 (Chapple, 2011), but the wind put a damper on the passing game after the break. Nevertheless, the senior signal caller looked comfortable and confident throughout for the Crimson.
Stewart’s commanding performance came after back-to-back weeks in which Harvard (4-4, 2-3 Ivy League) lost close games to nationally ranked Ivy League stalwarts Princeton (8-0, 5-0) and Dartmouth (7-1, 4-1). In seven games (four starts), the Crimson quarterback has now thrown for 11 touchdowns without a single interception.
The senior is making his chance to quarterback Harvard count. He had thrown just 51 career passes before this season, all of which came in his sophomore season.
The Lions (1-4, 4-4) improved after being blitzed in the first quarter, but they were never able to make a dent in the deficit, as the Crimson scored at least a touchdown in each quarter to stay comfortably ahead. In the end, Harvard racked up 496 yards of total offense en route to just its second victory since Sept. 21st.
It would be very tough for Stewart to top his senior day performance, but he will look to maintain his exceptional play and the Crimson’s winning ways at Penn (3-2, 6-2) on Saturday and then against Yale (3-2, 5-3) at Fenway Park. With consecutive wins, Harvard would finish back above .500 after a rare 5-5 season in 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard fencing lunged, parried, and riposted its way to successful finishes in both the men’s and women’s divisions during this weekend’s preseason-starting Penn State Open.
The tournament, which was scored individually rather than as a team, saw nine top-10 finishers across men’s and women’s foil, epee, and saber. Taking place nearly a month prior to the official start of the season, the match served as a check-in, showing the athletes where to keep progressing and where to put more focus.
“I think people’s physical abilities, and the strength and conditioning we’ve been doing, has really paid off,” said co-captain Eli Dershwitz, a saber fencer. “This was a really good preseason tournament for us to get ready for the rest of the season.”
The tournament, which kept each competitor fencing for most of the day, attracted powers in the sport from across the country.
“The format of it is just to make sure all the athletes get as many bouts as possible,” Dershwitz said. “I think this was so great for everyone on the team to get so many opportunities to practice [and] get really, highly competitive bouts against some of the big powerhouses in the country, like Notre Dame was there, the defending two-time NCAA champion, Penn State was there, Ohio State, some of the other big names.”
MEN
Junior George Haglund earned Harvard’s top finish of the tournament across both teams, fencing his way to a bronze medal in foil. Haglund advanced to the semi-finals before falling 15-14 to Penn State freshman and eventual champion Sebastian Tirado.
Four of the five members from last year’s NCAA tournament team, which finished fifth in the nation, returned to the team this season. Last year’s team was also crowned Ivy League champions.
The men’s team put individuals in the top 10 for every event, with Haglund and junior Matt Branman both achieving that mark in foil. Despite the solo nature of fencing, Haglund chalked up his some of his success to the newest member of the Crimson’s fencing staff, assistant coach Matteo Zennaro
“We just got a new foil coach, … he’s an awesome guy,” Haglund said. “He was really helpful.”
Zennaro, who specializes in foil, served as an assistant coach for Ohio State last year after a decade helming the Italian Junior National team - a role he came into after his own time as a member of the Italian National Team, where he picked up a silver medal at the 1999 World Championships in Seoul and earned a bronze during the team event at the 2000 Olympics.
WOMEN
The women’s team, which also placed fifth at the 2018 NCAA National Championship, returns four of its five members.
The team put two in the top-10 for epee and three in the top-10 for saber. Freshman Martha Merriam and co-captain Gabby Tartakovsky, both in saber, advanced to the tournament’s single-elimination quarterfinals, while senior epee fencer Sharon Ra also earned a spot in the top-10.
Merriam notched the highest finish of the day, placing fifth overall in saber after falling in a closely contested 15-12 match against Notre Dame sophomore Reghan Ward. Tartakovsky also fell in a close quarterfinal match, finishing sixth after a 15-13 loss.
Both Harvard teams return to competition on December 2 against NYU, Vassar, Sacred Heart, Penn State, and Temple at the Sacred Heart Invitational in Fairfield, Conn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard women’s soccer team prepared to kick off against Columbia in its final game of the season, every single outfield player in the graduating class had scored a goal in their collegiate careers—with the exception of one.
Last Saturday at Jordan Field, senior forward Alli Wiggins changed that, powering her side to an early lead with her first career goal in her final collegiate game.
A stray ball in the 11th minute gave Wiggins the opportunity to put herself on the board. The Methuen, Mass., native collected the ball on the right side of the box and fired a low shot past Lions senior goalkeeper Sophie Whitehouse off a deflection, giving the home team an early 1-0 advantage.
“The ball was bouncing around the box, and fortunately landed right at my feet,” Wiggins said. “I knew I had a pretty good shot, and took it. It was great to put the team ahead in a game that meant so much to us.”
On a Senior Day teeming with emotion, the Crimson took that spark and overcame the Lions, 2-1.
All four Harvard senior field players—star midfielder and co-captain Leah Mohammadi, fellow co-captain Zayne Matulis, defensive midfielder Niki Young, and Wiggins—along with goalkeeper Danielle Etzel, were honored in a pregame ceremony.
“They’re just great people,” said head coach Chris Hamblin, having just finished his third year at the helm of the team. “They always put the team first. They’re always going to give their hearts every single day. They’re moving on to their next phase in life, but they’ve really given us so much, and hopefully they’ve taken a real positive out of their time here.”
Together, the senior class has seen its fair share of highs and lows, having won the Ivy League title and earned a bid to the NCAA tournament in 2016, but also having finished in the bottom half of the conference table in 2017. The graduating class of 2019, however, was able to end its time in Cambridge on a high note, capping a 7-7-1 roller-coaster 2018 regular season with a win.
The new-look Harvard squad got off to a 2-4 start in 2018, showing flashes of gelling but more so inconsistency, before busting out a huge 2-0 win over Northeastern in mid-September and setting the stage for a midseason renaissance.
The Crimson then got off to a roaring start in conference play, starting 3-0-1 and pushing its overall record to 6-5-1 before cooling off in late October. The squad proceeded to settle for a .500 overall record and a 4-2-1 Ivy mark, good enough for a tie with Dartmouth for third amongst the Ancient Eight. The Lions (8-7-1, 1-4-3) finished fifth.
On a windy Saturday afternoon, Harvard certainly came up clutch in the final game of the season. After Columbia tied the score in the 17th minute, the two sides went back and forth until a golden opportunity opened up later in the game on the counterattack for the Crimson.
Fed by an adept interception and clearing pass by junior midfielder Meg Tveit in the 79th minute, Mohammadi sprinted half the field with the wind at her back, finding sophomore forward Murphy Agnew with a through pass to the left side.
Agnew buried the shot for her second goal of the season and first game-winner, as the score proved decisive in giving Harvard a 2-1 lead.
“I just saw the goalie was off her line, and if I had taken another touch, she would have been there, so I just took one touch,” Agnew said. “It hit the back of the net...it’s so exciting because I really wanted to win this game.”
With heavy gusts of wind in the face of the Columbia attack, the Crimson defense was able to prevent any realistic scoring opportunity by the Lions in the closing minutes.
Columbia ended up outshooting Harvard 10-9, though both sides made three saves. The Crimson committed 11 fouls to the Lion’s four.
Lions freshman midfielder Jessica Schildkraut scored the first-half tying goal off of a rebound off the crossbar for her third goal of the season to make it 1-1. Fighting the wind, Columbia couldn’t fend off Harvard in the second half.
As the final horn sounded, so too did the curtain come down on the season.
Mohammadi led Harvard on the season with 17 points with seven goals and three assists, while Hirst, Agnew, and freshman Taylor Nielsen combined for eight goals and nine assists.
For all the uncertainty that surrounds incoming rookies, the platoon of freshmen produced fantastically for the Crimson, as nine of the team’s 19 goals were scored by first-years. The rookies were also instrumental in joining veteran defenders like Tveit on the backline, providing security for Etzel in goal.
Freshmen Trinity Thomas, Jillian Wachira, Jordan Di Verniero, and Lara Schenk, in addition to Nielsen and Hirst, all had their moments in significant playing time.
Etzel, closing a season with a career-best five individual shutouts over 1000 minutes played, got the win to move to 7-5-1. Etzel posted a career 0.99 goals-against average and made 119 career saves.
Harvard, picked to finish fifth in preseason predictions, performed better than the polls expected, but were perhaps inconsistent all season long. Though its mainstays are graduating, Harvard’s core of returning talent is formidable enough to become a consistent force in 2019 and beyond.
On Saturday, Mohammadi said she “just knew” Agnew would bury the game-winning shot in her post-game interview. Her words of confidence were not just in regards to on-field performances—the team’s leader has confidence in what the squad can do moving forward.
“They’re going to have a strong foundation to build on for the future,” Mohammadi said.

The last time the Harvard men’s hockey team remained winless through its first four regular-season games, not a single member of the current roster was alive. In fact, neither was coach Ted Donato ’91. That’s because the last time the Crimson skated through its opening four contests without a victory, some members of the Harvard student body were fighting in World War II.
The year was 1940, and it stands as the only instance of a winless Crimson team through four games in the 121-year-old documented history of the Harvard hockey program.
This weekend, the Crimson (0-2-1, 0-2-1 ECAC), still in search of its first triumph of the campaign, hopes to keep this staggering streak intact when it trips down to New Haven, Conn., to visit none other than storied Ivy League rival Yale (2-1-0, 2-1-0).
“You get two teams with so much history of playing against each other that everyone is going all-out,” senior goaltender Michael Lackey said. “Guys are stepping up that may not step up in other games…. Everyone is going 110 percent to get the win.”
Unlike their Cambridge counterparts, the Bulldogs enter the Friday tilt with multiple ticks in the win column, having defeated Brown to open the season before splitting last weekend’s series with Upstate New York travel partners, then-No. 18 Cornell (loss) and Colgate (win).
The intensity of a Harvard-Yale bout, however, scarcely depends on the teams’ records coming into the game.
“We’ve had a lot of great games with them over the last ten years,” coach Donato said. “Whether it’s our place or their place, the environment is always pretty electric. I’m sure our guys that have done it before will be very excited, and the new guys will bring their own excitement, but it’s a good challenge for us to play a very good team on the road.”
In addition to potentially earning its first win of the year, the Crimson has an opportunity to avenge a season sweep at the hands of the Bulldogs in 2017-2018. In two clashes that more or less bookended last regular season, Yale held Harvard to just three combined goals.
In early November, the visiting Bulldogs handed the Crimson its first home loss in over a year, and in late-February, a pair of goals by then-freshman Kevin O’Neil soured the end of Harvard’s regular season. Not dwelling on the recent past, the Crimson enters the weekend with a fresh-start mindset.
“We actually didn’t bring [the 2017-2018 season sweep] up,” Lackey said. “This is a new team. [We’re] trying to build off what we’ve done at the start of the season, play to our strengths, and go in with a clean slate.”
The Crimson is still searching for consistency in the opening stage of the campaign. Coach Donato has experimented with numerous line combinations and multiple starting goaltenders through three games, as the group works to improve its team defense and play a more complete, 60-minute game.
Early on, Harvard has received significant offensive contributions from its freshmen, such as blue-liner Jack Rathbone (2–4—6) and forwards Jack Drury (1–4—5), Casey Dornbach (1–3—4), and Baker Shore (1–1—2). With these four first-years assuming critical roles in the lineup right away, the freshman class has accounted for 44 percent of the team’s total scoring through three games.
“[Producing] is easy when you’re playing around really good guys,” Rathbone said. “We’ve been playing really well together. We’ve had those moments where we’re pretty unstoppable. Now we just need to string together a full 60, and I think once we do that, we’ll be fine.”
Junior defenseman Adam Fox, a Preseason All-ECAC selection, is setting the Crimson’s overall scoring pace with eight points (1–7—8). The Jericho, N.Y., native is the facilitator on college hockey’s second-best powerplay (.429) in the early part of the season and deservedly draws attention from every opponent.
Despite his offensive prowess, Fox’s primary role is to keep other teams’ forwards in check. On Friday against Yale, he and his fellow Harvard rearguards will have their hands full with Bulldogs senior Joe Snively.
Snively, also named to the Preseason All-ECAC team, has logged seven points (3–4—7) through three contests and has done significant damage to the Crimson in the past, putting up 10 points (4–6—10) in eight career appearances against Harvard.
“[Snively] is one of the top players in the league right now and has been for the last couple of years,” coach Donato lauded. “He’s dangerous. He’s fast, he’s skilled, he’s a goal-scorer, he makes plays. He’s certainly someone that we’re going to have to keep a close tab on.”
Skating alongside the Herndon, Va., product are freshman center Curtis Hall (1–4—5) and O’Neil (2–1—3). The trio comprises Yale’s most potent line offensively, combining for 68 percent of the team’s scoring through its first two weekends.
In net, coach Donato will likely turn back to Lackey (0-1-1, 5.30 GAA, .780 SV%), who received the starting nod last Saturday in a 4-4 draw with Princeton after junior Cameron Gornet (0-1-0, 5.27, .833) manned the pipes the previous night against Quinnipiac. As of Tuesday, however, Lackey had not received any official indication of his role in the upcoming Ancient Eight tilts.
As the numbers of both backstops indicate, the Crimson has been porous on defense in its first three games. Until the copious goals against subside, the starting goaltender role is for the taking.
For the Bulldogs, the battle for the blue paint is no less intense. Junior Corbin Kaczperski (1-1-0, 2.53, .900) has fielded pucks in two of Yale’s three games at the outset of the campaign after earning roughly half the starts in the 2018 portion of last season. Senior Sam Tucker (1-0-0, 2.00, .931), who began last campaign as the Bulldogs’ number-one, has started just once this season but posted sturdier numbers in that effort.
“From the moment you commit to a school like this…it’s one of the games you definitely circle on your calendar in terms of the atmosphere and the building, so it’ll be really cool,” said Rathbone ahead of Friday’s bout with Yale.
Whether the Crimson snaps a 78-year streak on Friday or not, it will head to Providence, R.I., for a matchup with Brown (0-3-1, 0-2-1) the following evening. While the ambiance in Meehan Auditorium will be predictably more subdued than the rivalry-fueled energy at “The Whale,” an equivalent two standings points are on the line.
Plus, in 2017-2018 Harvard learned the hard way not to underestimate any opponent. Despite the Bears consistently being an ECAC bottom-feeder in recent years, Brown stunned an unsuspecting Crimson team last February, commencing an end-of-season rut for coach Donato’s group that extended into the first game of conference tournament play.
Much like Harvard, the Bears have benefitted from the play of their rookies early on this season. Three freshmen forwards lead the way in scoring: Justin Jallen (2–2—4), Tristan Crozier (2–1—3), and Jake Harris (1–2—3).
While Brown tied a struggling Colgate team last weekend, it also played Cornell to a close one-goal game, albeit a losing effort for the Bears. So the Crimson will not be taking its nearby ECAC opponent lightly.
“The atmosphere at Brown is unlike most places in the ECAC…[in that] there are not many fans,” Lackey said. “We talked about as a group bringing our own energy and creating energy on the ice to get the guys going. If you don’t do that, you can kind of fall in the trap.”
As strange as it sounds, few things in college hockey are as certain as the uncertainty in the ECAC, as the conference schedule is annually rampant with parity.
On Friday night, this trend will only heighten the intensity and unpredictability of a classic Harvard-Yale clash. On Saturday, it will raise the stakes for the Crimson, as recent history has taught the squad that no two standings points ever come easily.

Totally bamboozled about your concentration? Stressed beyond words about the upcoming declaration deadline? We asked Flyby sophomores why they picked their field of study — or the fields of study they're still choosing between. Welcome to Why I Declared 2018.
Classical Languages and Literatures & Linguistics: Carmen S. Enrique
I’ve wanted to study both Classics and Linguistics since I was in high school. When you have less popular interests, people always question your motives for going down a “less profitable” or “less useful” path. The simple answer is that I don’t really know why I want to study language; I just enjoy it. The deeper reason is that I love Latin poetry and need to take at least one class about it per semester to stay sane. I realized that this dependency could easily lead to a concentration, so here I am. As for Linguistics, I just find it interesting. The field is so innovative and interdisciplinary, and every part of it is wildly different. At its best, Linguistics is a collection of fun facts; at its worst, it’s a bad trip that leaves you stumbling blindly out of Sever, wondering if words are real. Both of these fields of study are often sold as small departments where you can get individualized attention. While that’s true and it’s great, it’s a shame that Classics and Linguistics have to market themselves that way. Instead, I think of them as two amazing (and prestigious) departments with great courses and brilliant faculty.
History and Literature OR English & Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality: Rocket Claman
Hi, my name is Rocket, like a spaceship, affectionately known on Flyby as Rickshaw, and a few days out I’m still not entirely sure what I’ll be declaring as my concentration. I am leaning towards a joint concentration in English and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, but am also considering a joint in History & Literature and WGS. I was drawn to storytelling from a young age, and spent my life in elementary and middle school navigating busy hallways with an armful of binders and my nose stuck in a book. Therefore, I would ideally love to write a political novel as my thesis. With this in mind, I still need to figure out the degree to which a creative thesis is possible in different departments.
I love English, but I’m passionate about social justice issues and active enough politically, that I know that doing just English wouldn’t fulfill my desires — this political drive needs to find its way into my concentration, I’m just not sure how quite yet. Maybe I’ll do a Government or Sociology secondary. Who knows? I do know that I am at my happiest when working on creative projects, and if possible would love to include aspects of that in my course of study. Basically, I’m stressed. And excited! But stressed.
