After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team opened up its season at home with two wins in the newly renovated Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Scoring nine goals over the course of the two games, the team has given itself a base to build upon for the rest of the season.
Harvard 5, Union 2
The Crimson (2-0-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) started the game off quietly, held scoreless in the first period while the Dutchwomen (1-8-1, 0-2-0) notched a goal in the opening five minutes of play.
The rhythm of the game quickly changed in the second period, as Harvard came out of the locker room with a renewed energy, scoring twice with a two minute period. The first goal came from the stick of junior forward Miye D’Oench off an assist from senior defensemen Marissa Gedman and freshman forward Karly Heffernan that ricocheted off of Union goalie Shanae Lundberg’s skate and found the back of the goal. A minute and 11 seconds later another Heffernan assist helped D’Oench’s shot once again find the net, this time in the upper left-hand corner.
“I think the first period was definitely a wakeup call for us that you can’t take any team lightly,” D’Oench said. “That being said we went into the second period knowing that we needed to just play our game, and we didn’t need to make any huge adjustments but keep playing Harvard hockey.”
Heffernan ultimately went to go on and tally a goal of her own, capping off Harvard’s scoring effort at the end of the game. The first two games of the year have each had a scoring drive delivered by a freshman, making the class of 2018’s voice heard early in the season.
“It’s great,” D’Oench said. “They’re playing with a ton of confidence, they’re moving the puck well and they have their heads up. It really fires up the upperclassmen too. You want to feed off of that momentum whether you’re a freshman and it’s your first game, or you’re a senior and you’ve done this for four years.”
Sophomore goalie Molly Tissenbaum recorded her first career win in the victory, stopping seven of the Dutchwomen’s nine shots that were taken against her and notching the complete game in game.
Harvard 4, Rensselaer 1
The season opener against the Engineers (1-5-3, 0-1-1) was not only the first game for the team, but the first game Harvard coach Katey Stone has been on the sidelines for the Crimson since the 2012-2013 season. Stone spent last year preparing Team USA for their February competition in the Sochi Winter Olympics.
“We’re working hard to be the best we can,” Stone said. “We’ve got a long way to go and a lot to learn and we’ve got a lot to do but I love it. I love this place and I love this program so I’m happy to be back.”
D’Oench again was a large offensive contributor in the victory, scoring the opening and the closing goals of the game for Harvard. D’Oench has now tallied a point in 10 consecutive games, dating back to the 2013-2014 season.
Freshman forward Lexie Laing scored her first career goal off of the Crimson power play in the second period while junior forward Mary Parker also found the back of the net.
While veteran junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer was out of town playing for Team Canada in the Four Nations Cup, sophomore Brianna Laing took over in goal, making 12 saves on the night while allowing only one shot to find its way past her. Laing rounds out the collections of options Stone has to play between the posts, making the team a versatile powerhouse against any opposing offense.
“I think [having three goalies] speaks to the depth of this team and that we have a lot of faith in everyone that puts on the jersey,” D’Oench said. “It was awesome to see in the past three games we’ve seen all three goalies play and that speaks to how deep we are and the potential we have.”
Winning the opening two games of the season shows the potential for the team to have a successful season, but with the majority of its games still ahead, improvements are still on the forefront of the team’s agenda.
“We have to work on a lot,” Stone said. “One of the things I think we need to work on the most is that we need to talk to each other. We didn’t talk as much during the games as we do in practice. The good news is we have two weeks to get it done and get our game rolling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to claim supremacy in what has been a competitive Ancient Eight lineup, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams headed to Princeton to compete in the Ivy League Heptagonal Cross Country Championships.
While both teams raced hard, the squad fell short of its season expectations, as the women took fifth while the men finished in seventh. Princeton won its seventh title in the last nine years on the men’s side while No. 26 Dartmouth took home a second consecutive title on the women’s side.
“As a team it was a disappointment,” captain Will Geiken said. “We didn’t put our top runners where we wanted to be. It didn’t really work out.”
The women got the morning started with a solid team performance, with the front runners sticking together in a pack for the majority of the race, as the top five athletes for the Crimson all crossed the lines within six seconds of each other.
Junior Paige Kouba led the team with a 21:25.6 finish, placing 19th and was followed closely by sophomore Sarah Gillespie and senior Molly Renfer as they finished within 1.5 seconds of Kouba with times of 21:26.9 and 21:27.2, taking 21st and 23rd respectively.
The scoring contingent was wrapped up by seniors Alaina Alvarez and Viviana Hanley with times of 21:30.7 and 21:31.0, placing 27th and 29th. All five scoring Harvard runners placed in the top 30.
The race was particularly impressive for Hanley, who was running her first race of the year coming back from injury and provided a solid performance.
Maintaining a close pack was something that had been stressed all season on both sides, and as a results of successfully executing this, the women had one of their best races so far.
“It was probably [their] best performance as a team so far this year,” head coach Jason Saretksy said. “That’s been the strength of the women’s team all season and there’s potential for the whole pack to move up.”
The men followed soon after, as Junior Tom Purnell once again paced the Crimson, finishing the race with a time of 24:44.3 on the 8k course, the third straight race clocking in below 25 minutes.
The group took a gamble by starting the race near the front of the pack, as the Crimson led at the one mile split with various runners in the front of the pack with 5:05 miles, a slow pace for a collegiate race.
This would ultimately prove to be unsustainable as Harvard had dropped to seventh by the three mile mark, as Purnell was the sole Crimson runner to maintain the rigorous pace, staying near the front of the pack in second place before ultimately dropping back to eighth.
The muddy conditions, along with the confined pack, ultimately proved unfriendly to a few Harvard runners, Will Geiken was accidentally tripped a mile and a half into the race.
“I went down and lost a shoe,” Geiken said. “I just wasn’t able to catch up to the front group at that point and I was unable to get back up for the rest of the race.”
Purnell was followed by freshman Ben Huffman, who placed 24th with a time of 25:04.1 in his Heptagonals debut. He was followed by a score of upperclassmen, as junior Chris Allen crossed third for the Crimson finishing at 25:07.4 while seniors Geiken and Dan Milechman were the next Harvard runners with times of 25:11.6 and 25:25.7, respectively.
While the race did not go as planned for Harvard, Saretsky believes that the team could still make a strong statement at NCAA Regionals.
“We get a bit of a chance for redemption,” Saretsky said. “We’ll see five of the Ivy [teams] in our region; we’ll be looking to exact some revenge on some of those schools.”
The Crimson will take a couple of weeks off of racing before heading down to New York to participate in the NCAA Northeast Regionals, looking to gain a birth to the NCAA championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cold and rainy night in Hanover, the Harvard team (9-4-2, 2-1-2, Ivy) battled Dartmouth (9-4-2, 3-1-1) to a 1-1 tie that left the Crimson alive in the Ivy League race, but no longer in control of its own destiny.
“[Dartmouth] is a very good team,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “The guys really fought. It was wet and rainy and a bit of a scrappy game but they are a good team. It took everything we had to create our chances."
The Big Green struck first when Stefan Defregger sent in a laser from 25 yards out in the sixth minute that sailed past the fingertips of goalkeeper Evan Mendez, who gave up just four goals in the team’s first four Ivy League contests. For the second straight Ancient Eight contest, the visiting Crimson found itself in an early hole.
“Their first goal was very good,” Lehrer said. “There is not much we are able to do about that kind of goal.”
Unlike against Princeton, the Crimson defense then immediately locked down the Dartmouth attack. The team centered its defensive strategy on limiting the touches for star Big Green forward Alex Adelabu. One of seven seniors in Dartmouth’s starting lineup, Adelabu came into the game with 15 points in 15 games but registered only two off-target shots on the night.
“We really stopped him from having opportunities,” Lehrer said. “The other players are obviously getting shots, [but] it is a bit of design about who is shooting it. Anyone can finish on any given day, but we were trying to limit the best player from getting the touches and shots on goal.”
On the night, Harvard took advantage of its few opportunities. The team’s only shot of the evening came in the fourth minute, when freshman midfielder Sam Brown found co-captain Kyle Henderson right outside the box. Henderson snuck a ball by Dartmouth goalkeeper Stefan Cleveland for the equalizer, his fourth goal of the season.
“I think they did a good job of challenging for every ball and not giving us free plays,” Henderson said. “They played a very good game against us.”
Defense prevailed for the final 70 minutes of play. The last great chance for either team came with about 10 seconds to play, when Adelabu finally got sprung. Sprinting into the open field, Adelabu beat Mendez but had his shot blocked by sophomore forward Daniel Smith with six seconds to go. The follow up by Hugh Danilack his the crossbar, allowing the Crimson to clear and come away with the tie.
“It was very impressive what [the defense] did tonight,” Lehrer said. “We would transition from attack to defense at full spring and took away a lot of their opportunities. I think it was a really big step forward.”
Lehrer noted that the team did a good job on possession but struggled to convert those chances into points once again. In five Ivy League games, the Crimson has scored just six goals after notching three or more in each of five games in a late September stretch.
Henderson was quick to praise the efforts of the defense, which has kept the team in every game. Harvard has not lost a game by more than two goals all season, in large part due to a defense that pitched four shutouts in October and allowed just three goals all month. The Crimson has allowed its opponent to score three times just once all season.
“Our back line has done a great job across the board,” Henderson said. “They did a good job of containing their attacks … It was a good group effort from all of them.”
The tie leaves Harvard tied with Penn for third place in the Ivy League, two points behind co-leaders Princeton and Dartmouth. The Crimson will take on Columbia at home next weekend before taking on the Quakers in Philadelphia to end the season. Dartmouth, which owns the head-to-head victory over Princeton, controls its own destiny in league play with only Cornell and Brown—two of the league’s worst three teams—left on its schedule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Halloween weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team’s performance scared its opponents and every other team in the Ivy League.
With away wins over Brown and Yale, the Crimson climbed into first place among the Ancient Eight. In each of its victories, which furthered a seven-game winning streak, Harvard (15-4, 8-2 Ivy) held the two opponents to a combined .055 killing percentage.
“The Ivy League is a long road for volleyball because we play every team twice,” sophomore setter Corie Bain said. “There is tremendous room for improvement throughout the season, and we have done an unbelievable job of working towards our end goal [of] an Ivy League title.”
HARVARD 3, YALE 0
The Crimson left Lee Amphitheater in New Haven on Saturday night having done something that no Ancient Eight team had done in 36 games—win three sets against the Bulldogs (12-7, 8-2) on their own turf. While in these 36 games, teams couldn’t win three sets out of five, the Crimson took it one step further, beating Yale in straight sets to complete the season sweep.
“I think our confidence has grown with each win, which allows us to keep playing better and better,” said senior middle blocker Caroline Walters. “We have worked very hard, and it shows in our play.”
As Harvard hung onto a 23-22 lead in the second set, the game seemed headed for a replay of the two teams’ first match-up in early October, when the Crimson battled to a 3-2 victory. But a kill from junior setter Hannah Schmidt and an attacking error from Yale delivered the set, and the momentum, directly into Harvard’s hands.
In the third set, the Crimson jumped out to a 5-2 lead and never looked back. The margin ultimately ballooned to 25-15, when junior middle blocker Caroline Holte sealed the victory with a kill.
Coming into the match, the Bulldogs had run through the last seven games of Ancient Eight play with impressive dominance, dropping only one set during this period. Yale’s last loss of any kind came against Harvard at the beginning of October. That one came in front of a friendly crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center, but this weekend, the Crimson proved that hometown advantage alone couldn’t account for its success.
“The crowd [at Yale] was full of energy, which I think helped fuel our fire,” Walters said. “That being said, we definitely quieted the crowd with our play.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
When Brown middle blocker Payton Smith captured the first set for her team with a block, Crimson players could be forgiven if they experienced flashbacks to October 4. On that day, Harvard conceded the first set to the Bears on the way to a surprising 3-0 home defeat.
But a month later, the Crimson had different plans. Harvard tied the game with a dominant second set, took the lead with a comeback in the third, and captured victory with a late surge in the fourth.
Overall, Harvard forced the Bears into a .018 killing percentage. While Harvard recorded 26 more kills than errors, Brown’s margin was just three.
“Our plan on defense was to take away their strong shots with the block,” Walters said. “I think everyone really did their jobs and stayed discipline in their play on defense.
Despite a 1-1 set score, the Bears looked like the superior team at the beginning of the third set. Not even a Harvard timeout could forestall the Bears, who raced to a 10-1 advantage.
The lead would not last as the Crimson employed efficient defense to fight to a tie at 20-20 and again at 23-23. From there, a Brown attacking error and a kill from freshman outside hitter Paige Kebe handed the set to Harvard. The Crimson would never fall behind during the remainder of the match.
“We are not done,” Bain said. “I know each of us will walk in the gym Monday ready to work as hard as we have the past few weeks.”

We've all got those few people we’ve met multiple times, actually gotten to know, but somehow not quite managed to remember their names. Awkward. Being a good name sleuth is key to a successful four years at Harvard. How else are you going to hook Mr. or Ms. Right, or network your way to the top? Luckily we're here to help you out!
A Starbucks OutingThere’s no better place! Your friend has to say their name to place an order. If you happen to miss it at the register--Do you ever listen? Are you even listening to us now?!–keep your ears open at the pick-up counter when the barista calls with the order. It’s a simple yet subtle way of scoring that name. If you’re going off the barista’s spelling on the cup, however, be ready to problem solve--Michelle is likely not “Missle.”
The Harvard College FacebookDo you know ANYTHING about the person at all? Dorm/House? Concentration? Please maybe at least class year? Populate the data you have and go go go! Depending on how much you already know, you may have as few as 10 potential targets (perhaps your person of interest is a Folk & Myth concentrator) or 1600 (really, all you know is he’s a sophomore?).
The D-Hall StalkCome armed to dinner with a five dollar bill and none of your dignity. Ask your friend to dinner and let them swipe in first. Once they're in the servery, slip the HUDS swiper the five to get the name.
The Smooth MoveIf your friend is actually a romantic interest, try inviting yourself over for some “quality alone time.” Before closing the door behind you, check the names on the door. That should help you narrow it down to four or five at most. If the lucky time comes, cross your fingers, scream a name, and hope for the best.
