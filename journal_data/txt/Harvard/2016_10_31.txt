After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeff and Karen Gaffney (Zach Galifianakis, Isla Fisher) live a stunningly quiet life on an impossibly suburban Atlanta cul-de-sac. “Kinko’s was bananas,” a neighbor tells Jeff as Karen and he return from sending their kids off in a bright yellow school bus to summer camp. “It often is!” Jeff responds, without a hint of irony. Enter Tim and Natalie Jones (Jon Hamm, Gal Gadot), a “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” pair of spies masquerading—poorly—as the Gaffney’s new neighbors.
As with most comedies, the film’s first half hour is by far its strongest. In some of the film’s better camera work, the Joneses are introduced from the perspective of Karen, spying on them through a window, and seem to glow with the stylish allure of, well, Hollywood A-listers. Even the blurry phone photos of the couple she sends to Jeff look like glamour shots.
Initial establishing scenes for characters are understated and delightful. Tim holds guests at a block party (“Junetoberfest”) spellbound with a story of his near-death experience lost in the desert, casually opening a beer bottle with his wedding ring; Jeff Gaffney, standing next to him, attempts to do the same and shatters the bottle in his hand. Across the lawn, Natalie Jones, dressed like a runway model, plays darts like a professional knife thrower.
The dichotomy of this film relies on the total normalcy of the Gaffneys, and both Fisher and Galifianakis deliver credible straight-man performances. Such a role is particularly unusual for Galifianakis, whose fame as a comic actor is built on playing awkward, oddball characters. Nevertheless, his Jeff is believable and generous; it would have been easy to bring a hammier character, but “Keeping Up with the Joneses” would likely have been a worse movie for it. Fisher’s Karen, an interior decorator tasked with uninspiring projects like adding a urinal to a home bathroom, is also quite good. Nobody will be handing out Oscars to either Galifianakis or Fisher, but neither could really have done much better with characters designed explicitly to be ordinary.
Hamm and Gadot have the opposite problem. Their characters, as written, are manifestly unbelievable under even the slightest scrutiny. Gadot is largely shielded by director Greg Mottola: With the exception of a few lines (“I may not need to moisturize, but I still have feelings,” Natalie tells Karen), her character is not called upon to demonstrate any sort of interior life. Hamm, meanwhile, proves so naturally charismatic that much like Brad Pitt as Mr. Smith, his superspy-suburbanite seems at least plausible as long as he is physically onscreen. That said, the film probably looks a little too closely at his character: Superspies are much more appealing at a slight distance.
Michael LeSieur’s script, which features the Joneses looking into local company MBI while the Gaffneys look into them, requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief as well. Other than noting that Natalie is a beautiful, accomplished woman who wears short dresses, the film does not explain why Karen suspects the Joneses so quickly.  And do trained spies really need to embed themselves in a suburban neighborhood—they buy and furnish an entire house—in order to pull this job off? (No.)
That said, if one can swallow the storyline, the plot moves along at a pleasant, leisurely pace. There are a few action scenes, but the over-the-top violence typical of spy movies is largely forced into the background by the overwhelming normalcy of Jeff and Karen Gaffney. In one scene, the Gaffneys hold up a rescue by bickering back and forth, a steady stream of bullets conveniently missing them. The moment scans almost like a parody of the spy genre, in which it seems absolutely impossible for a significant character to be casually shot in a firefight.
At the end of the day, “Keeping Up with the Jones” is a fundamentally conservative movie: All its main characters are doing fine, and they’re all going to be fine. Unusually for a comedy, the film depicts stable, grounded people in stable, grounded marriages. Despite the occasional frustration, there is no indication that either the Gaffneys or the Joneses are unhappy with their marriage. No one is psychotically wacky; no one is cringe-inducingly awkward. The resulting film ends up being rather restrained: There is very little reliance on physical comedy,  and (thankfully) almost no cringe comedy.
Unfortunately, LeSieur and Mottola don’t seem to have found an entirely satisfying way to end the movie. Their film, which draws its comedy from a contrast of characters rather than an interesting plot, has no clear point at which to stop. But audience patience isn’t unlimited, and so “Keeping Up with the Joneses” ends after about an hour and a half—not resolved, exactly, but simply over.

“Float” is the 20th work published by Anne Carson—classicist, essayist, poet, critic, playwright, translator, professor, and all around polymath. Her jack-of-all-trades approach to art typically manifests in both her works themselves and the variance between them, and “Float” is no exception. As both a critical and creative piece, the collection allows Carson to approach her subject, translation, from two different directions. Her writing gives rise to fantastic insights about what can be achieved through translation and what must, by the very nature of transference, be left behind. Her medium here is as important as her message: Different forms, levels of speech, and links fully flesh out her concepts.
Having won many awards, including the Pushcart Prize and Guggenheim and MacArthur Fellowships, Carson often speaks at events. Out of these lectures and performances, Carson created around half of the 12 chapbooks that comprise “Float.” Arranged alphabetically, these books are meant to be read in any order. Given that “Float” contains essays, thematically connected poems, and combinations thereof, the amount of consistency in the piece becomes exquisitely impressive. All of the pieces expose different facets of the same obsessive but fruitless pursuit of capturing and speaking the truth of individual perception.
The issue of translation forms a focal point for the work’s psychological occupations, most clearly evident in an essay on the issues of translation called “Variations on the Right to Remain Silence.”  The poem’s examination of the reasoning behind adopting foreign words into English is especially thought-provoking; as Carson writes, it is “an acknowledgement of the fact that languages are not algorithms of one another, you cannot match them item for item.” Thus, Carson highlights a central problem of translation: it will never be exact, and the English language, to some degree, has accepted that. This essay ends with an exercise in interpretive translation, with five different translations of a fragment of the Greek poet Ibycus, all wildly different. The piece itself further explores the way translations may diverge dramatically yet still be correct in reference to Joan of Arc’s trial, Francis Bacon’s paintings, and Friedrich Holderlin’s Greek translations. Carson uses this technique of exploring a concept relative to surprising sources throughout the collection—a metafictive way of “translating” one context into another.
While the essays do much of the conceptual legwork, the poems embody it in a more intimate way. The poetry in “Float” is highly fragmented and characterized by postmodern free organization, which is often clinical or inconsistent. Here, though, it masterfully demonstrates Carson’s personal perception of translation. In “Wildly Constant,” which chronicles a walk in Iceland, Carson contemplates icebergs as inaccessible libraries, natural history unable to be effectively “translated” into human understanding. This gives rise to a more psychoanalytic concern:  “I have no theory / of why we are here / or what any of us is a sign of.” This preoccupation resurfaces in “Reticent Sonnet”: “I used to think I would grow up to be a person whose reasoning was deep, / instead I became a kind of brush. / I brush words against words. So do we follow ourselves out of youth, / brushing, brushing, brushing wild grapes onto truth.” Here Carson highlights her firsthand worry: the personal failure of being unable to translate fully, of her entire life work coming down to pursuing the impossible. Carson avoids the pitfall of over-intellectualization by inserting a vital humanity through interruptions to convey the fragmentation she herself feels.
This alienation from ability leads to a connection between translation and mental perception. Carson combines the two most explicitly in “Nelligan,” which contains eight translations of Émile Nelligan poems. Carson’s translations enliven the work with their refreshing disregard for the forms and formal language of the originals and thereby introduce her central conceit: Translation only works on an individual basis. To choose a different structure, to say that another form is better for the communication of a range of desperate emotions of these poems, is to bring in models that have meaning only for a certain few who would have, reading and understanding the originals, thought of them exactly as she did. Thus, Carson subtly points out the personal color present in every translation.
The word choice of Carson’s translations serve to drive the point on perception home. In “Hospital night dream,” she compares her translations of French poems to those of Cogswell, who translated them in the early ’80s. She substitutes “one of those paintings” for Cogswell’s “those oils of hers”; Cogswell’s “mysterious blaze of chandeliers” becomes “sudden mystic flare of big lamps.” Cogswell’s language maintains more fidelity to the original, while Carson aims to render these poems entirely in her own idiom, thus destroying the originals. Her essay, “Cassandra Float Can,” with its side-by-side translations of the prophecy in Aeschylus’ “Agamemnon,” invokes the etymology of the name Apollo, god of prophecy: “Apollo’s name is cognate with the Greek verb apollesthai, ‘to destroy utterly, kill, slay, demolish, lay waste.’” Still, Carson’s ever-present point is that all these translations, in their different forms and takeaways, are correct. Thereby Carson smartly exposes the different levels on which language works and is understood.
Furthermore, “Float” is a revolutionarily expansive text: Its essays, plays, poems, lists, and translations include topics from the ancient Greek prophet Cassandra to Brigitte Bardot. Carson’s tone shifts just as dramatically, at one moment deeply philosophical and the next modest and humorous. Still, Carson never deviates conceptually, focusing with complete clarity on the space between original words and their transference into other languages so that contemporary structures don’t necessarily have any more reality than the structures that produced the source material. Which is the original then becomes relative, and there cannot be a tether to the historical first. Carson admits to the reader a terrifying truth: To be cut adrift from your own context may be the modern—or oldest—definition of madness. Perhaps, Carson suggests, there is a kind of sanity to be found in delusion.

To the editor:
Campus health and wellness is an integral part of life at Harvard, and I encourage students to advocate for their health and well-being while also taking advantage of the many opportunities and resources already available on campus.
It can be difficult to navigate all of the numerous events and programs. As HealthPALs (Health Peer Advisors and Liaisons), we not only participate in planning these activities, but also work to promote them to students. Many of the general health and physical well-being initiatives on campus, which address many of the topics discussed in the recent Crimson op-ed, “A Healthier Harvard,” have focused on both raising awareness and facilitating student advocacy. These events include the Sleep Stuffer Event, where students made sleep kits and learned tips for a better night’s rest, and Glow in the Dark Yoga, where students practiced Vinyasa Yoga under the stars.
HealthPALs also works with Harvard Recreation to provide Weekly Workouts, collaborates with Wellness Tutors to bring activities such as yoga, workouts, and mindfulness activities to the Houses, such as yoga, workouts, and mindfulness activities, and assists HUHS with organizing free flu clinics in the dining halls.
These programs represent a small subset of the initiatives that HealthPALs work on. Our goal is to continue connecting students to health resources and providing them with opportunities to participate in programs and events on campus. We are always looking to hear from our fellow students, and we welcome any students who would like to join us in promoting awareness about these important topics and initiatives.
Paul M. Lewis ’18, a neurobiology concentrator in Eliot House, is the president of HealthPALs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 31, 2016, at 10:11 a.m.
Over the course of 22 days, Harvard’s dining hall workers staged an historic strike in order to demand increased wages and a more affordable health care plan than the University initially proposed. The strike itself was the culmination of a months-long ordeal during which the administration and the dining staff’s representative union, UNITE HERE Local 26, negotiated a new contract that would fulfill several specific demands from the dining hall employees. The final deal provided summer stipends—bringing full-time employees willing to work year round to an annual salary of at least $35,000—and no immediate healthcare changes.
An unprecedented mobilization of the dining staff, the strike affected campus life in myriad ways. In the absence of the dining hall workers, the administration was forced to cobble together provisional food services with limited resources. Meanwhile, half of the undergraduate dining halls—and thus, social hubs—closed. The College saw its House communities flounder and many students struggled with the disruption to their routine. Dividing on-campus community and inciting students and professors alike to take a stance on the issue, the strike reverberated beyond Harvard’s gates, garnering national attention as well.
Finally, the strike has come to a close—and, it seems, on HUDS workers’ terms. In light of the their nearly-unanimous vote to accept the University's contract proposal, it appears that HUDS workers are largely in favor of the deal. Despite the dogged back-and-forth between Local 26 and the University Administration, we recognize that the strike was truly the HUDS workers’ movement—one that many students enthusiastically supported, but did not threaten their own livelihoods. Given this distinction,  it is important to note that any students’ opinion on the contract is a triviality. If the workers are happy with it, so too are we.
Despite this qualification, many of the details of the contract that have surfaced bode well for the workers. As mentioned, the full-time workers willing to work year round will now take home a minimum of $35,000 annually, will not immediately pay more for healthcare copays, and will receive a baseline summer compensation. All of these improvements will surely make their condition of employment more livable.
Nevertheless, many nuances of the contract remain opaque. As of yet, neither the administration nor the union has published the details of the contract, a point which gives us pause. We urge both parties to be forthcoming with details of the contract in the coming weeks. Not only is it important that both parties maintain transparency, but the details of the contract would prove useful for the students and faculty who supported the strike, who certainly deserve to know the eventual outcome.
Meanwhile, we encourage Harvard administrators to make sure that, going forward, contingency plans improve in the case of an anticipated strike. It has been clear in the past three weeks that Harvard did not adequately prepare for the strike, and given the success of this strike, it seems plausible that other unions representing campus workers will be emboldened to strike in the future. To avoid the hefty costs that this strike imposed on workers and students alike, we urge Harvard to structure contingency plans in the future with more care, urgency, and proactivity.
Above all, though, we are comforted that this strike has put an end to workers' dissatisfaction and that our community is whole again. With workers back in the dining halls and students returning to their House communities for meals, we are proud to say that we supported a strike that ended as a success.
CORRECTION: Oct. 31, 2016The editorial was updated to clarify the fact that the final deal between Harvard and Local 26 provides summer stipends that bring full-time dining services employees willing to work year-round past a salary $35,000.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One hour north of New York City, a small school district in Rockland County has been coping with one of the most intense local election battles in recent memory over education and the consequences of tyranny through a simple-majority.
East Ramapo School District is a residential suburban area covering 35 square miles of an incredibly diverse group of New Yorkers. The fiscal monitor for the state’s education department characterizes the district as “high need, low resource.” The community is made up of an Orthodox Jewish population and a predominately African American and Latino community. Orthodox Jewish students are roughly two-thirds of the school-aged population, educated almost entirely in yeshivas, religious private schools where Yiddish is the primary instructional language. Many students in these private schools have disabilities, requiring special educational services and qualifying for additional educational funds from the state and federal government.
The other one-third of students are educated in the local public schools: 78 percent qualify for free and reduced lunch prices and 91 percent come from African American, Latino, and Haitian backgrounds.
How the community broke down into absolute disarray is a nuanced and complicated story, covered beautifully and extensively by Ben Calhoun in "This American Life." In short, the Hasidic community became fed up when confronted with the prospect of being unable to keep a student with special needs in a yeshiva while also receiving the appropriate government funds.
For years, these Hasids felt that they’d paid a disproportionate amount of taxes for schools their students didn’t even attend, and were furious when they couldn’t even get the financial support they needed.
So members of the Jewish Orthodox community decided to run for seats on the school board. The electoral gains were gradual, but one decade later, the school board for East Ramapo School District is made up of a majority from the Hasidic community whose children attend private yeshivas.
And the new majority made some serious changes. Public schools were closed and sold, class sizes increased, music classes eliminated, and extracurricular programs and AP classes cut. The shock of fiscal conservatism was made worse by the Recession and growing school age population: The school board cut funding for public instruction and increased funding for busing to the private schools and legal counsel for the board. Activists for the local public school describe trying frequently to attend school board meetings, only to have members go into closed session until the early hours of the morning to create a resolution—after working parents have had to leave for the night.
School board meetings have devolved into screaming, explicit insults, and personal threats. One side is fighting for their right to a basic education, and the other for the authority granted to them as democratically elected officials acting for a majority of the district. Historic sensitivities around racism and anti-Semitism are exacerbated, and fundamental disagreements about the role of education and the normative goals of majority rule exposed. And the staunch inability to compromise on either side has left an estranged community trying to overcome immense internal hostility.
Though the engaging presidential election has captivated most of the public’s attention going into November, competitive elections up and down the ballot should not and cannot be neglected. The stakes of the presidential election are certainly high, with the opportunity to nominate someone to the Supreme Court, define the U.S.’s involvement with the refugee crisis, and address much needed tax and prison reform. But some of the most pressing issues facing our democracy are playing out in our own neighborhoods, all around us, at the local level. The economic and racial divides demonstrated in East Ramapo are not specific to East Ramapo—they are divides inherent in the fabric of our democracy that build on the decisions we make at every level of government, for better or for worse.
There are no seats on the East Ramapo School Board that will be contested in November, but there are seats contested in the various state house and senate districts that represent Rockland County—officials who are fighting for state intervention to supply aid and mediation for the district. And though most of us won’t vote in East Ramapo's district, we are responsible for engaging with our own local politics. We can help build a better nation just by caring a bit more for the community directly around us, even when and especially if we aren’t directly affected by the government policies up for referenda in the coming election.

Harvard’s dining services workers returned to dining halls Thursday morning—less than 24 hours after ending their historic strike—where they were warmly welcomed back by students.
HUDS employees voted 583-1 this past Wednesday to ratify a proposed contract with the University that officially ended the strike. The new settlement established a $35,000 minimum annual salary for full-time HUDS workers and prevented any increases in healthcare copayments for the next five years.
Employees in dining halls across campus said they were happy to be back at work as they prepared and served lunch Friday afternoon.
“It’s been too long, three weeks,” Maria O. Sanchez, a HUDS worker stationed in Annenberg, said as she received hugs from freshmen filing into Annenberg’s serving area.
Alexis A. Martinez, a chef in Winthrop House’s dining hall, said he had so far found the transition to be “smooth” and “easy.”
In an email, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that "HR has been working with managers in reentry of HUDS employees."
Hernandez and Martinez emphasized that, on the whole, they were delighted to be working again. Both said they felt they had received a warm welcome—Hernandez from Harvard faculty, Martinez from undergraduates.
Students in several different Houses led efforts to welcome returning HUDS workers over the weekend, planning parties and creating “Welcome Back” cards for the workers. Karen Maldonado ’18, who put together Quincy House’s sign, said several people wrote kind messages on Friday morning.
“I think everyone can agree, whether they support the strike ideologically or not, that it’s great having [the HUDS workers] back, and not just because the food was different, but because it feels like a different place without them there,” Maldonado said.
Robert Miranda ’19, too, said the workers’ return had changed the atmosphere in the dining halls.
“I sort of missed the bustling attitude back in Annenberg [during the strike],” Miranda said. “I think it was a bit dead and empty before. Its kind of recaptured its former excitement.”
Students said they were especially pleased that the quality and diversity of meal offerings—which suffered during the strike—had returned to their normal state.
Westley K. Cook ’19 said he “made a beeline for the grille” the moment the dining halls reopened. Sung M. Ahn ’19 added that he had forgotten how much he loved eating from “real plates,” rather than disposable dishware.
As she finished up her lunch in the Inn at Harvard on Friday, Jessica R. Fournier ’17 said she was “incredibly proud” of HUDS employees for achieving “everything they wanted.”
“These are the people that I think students feel the closest to here,” Fournier said. “I know for myself I certainly feel way closer to HUDS workers than I do to a lot of other people, and I think that’s true for many students that are from working class backgrounds, like myself, or for students that are low-income or of color.”

Elementary school students poured through the tunnels of Adams House laughing and shrieking at every turn—handling buckets of candy and enjoying a haunted house organized by the Phillips Brooks House Association and Adams House Committee.
This past Saturday, PBHA partnered with Adams HoCo to organize an event that brought together elementary school students from across the Greater Boston area.
According to PBHA afterschool program group officer Victoria H. Jones ’17, a total of about 60 students from four different PBHA programs—Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment, Roxbury Youth Initiative, Chinatown Afterschool, and Franklin Afterschool Enrichment—attended the event.
The event comprised of three sets of activities within Adams House. The first portion was hosted in the “K Space"—a new party space in Adams—that included games, music, face paint, and pumpkin decorating. The second featured outdoor activities in the Adams courtyard. The final activity was trick-or-treating with House residents.
Upon arrival, the students appeared eager and excited to experience the holiday festivities. With costumes ranging from Power Rangers to classic ghost attire, the children embraced scrambling around a building in search of candy.
Aside from providing students with a fun activity during the weekend, the event was also served other purposes for PBHA, according to Adams HoCo member Gianna C. Cacciatore ’17, who is also the term-time director of the Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment program.
“Since all the programs are mixed together at the party, those neighborhoods will get to meet each other. That is great, because neighborhoods that have not historically gotten along, now have an opportunity to meet each other and make friends,” she said, referring to the various neighborhoods where the PBHA programs are based. “It’s a fun way to build a sense of community in the program."
The event allowed Harvard students to collaborate as well. Adams HoCo Chair Tasnim Ahmed ’17 said the event enabled the House to give back while also enabling Harvard students from different organizations to meet.
Coincidentally, the haunted house coincided with PBHA’s alumni weekend, which included a luncheon in Adams and gave alumni the opportunity to reunite with their old students whom they have not seen in years. One elementary school student even trampled over chair legs to embrace his old tutor, former PBHA President Jose Magana ’15.

Panelists argued that money has a skewed role in the American political process at an event this past Friday evening hosted by Democracy Matters, a national student organization that advocates for campaign finance reform.
The panel featured former financial executive Morris Pearl, author Frances Moore Lappé, and Winthrop House administrator Renaldo M. Pearson in Sever Hall with an audience of approximately 30 students.
Max Stahl, the director of political engagement at Democracy Matters, said the organization’s goal is to reform public finance by working with public officials.
“[We have] a pledge called the 'Restore Democracy Pledge' that we asked all of the presidential candidates to sign,” he said. “The text of it is, ‘I support restoring democracy by publicly financing elections and getting big money out of politics.’"
All of the panelists emphasized the need for reform, stressing the idea that the average American is excluded from the political process because of the influence of money in politics.
“Our basic stance is that one of the problems with America today is that a tiny number of very rich people use their money to get political power and then use their political power to make themselves even richer,” Pearl said.
The panel comes during a general election campaign that has seen some debate about campaign finance reform and the role of money in the political system more generally. Pearl said reforming this system would involve a redistribution of political power.
“We’re not going to change the idea that people with money have influence but we’re going to give people with less money, more influence,” he said.
Pearson also identified campaign financing as the root of many other social issues in the U.S. today, arguing that campaign finance structures reward the wealthiest Americans at the cost of underrepresented minority groups.
“If we were to end mass incarceration or close the equality gap around economic inequality or whatever issue we’re talking about, we have to first deal with this core issue of campaign finance,” he said.
Audience member Erin Olivieri ’19 said the event reinforced the importance of campaign financing for her.

The Office of Undergraduate Education’s Classroom to Table program has gained significant popularity since its inception last fall, allowing students and faculty to come together for meaningful conversation outside a traditional academic setting.
Created in September 2015, Classroom to Table allows either undergraduates or a faculty member to invite a group of four to six people for a meal at a participating restaurant in Harvard Square, where conversations can expand upon classroom dialogue, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noel Bisson said.
During the 2015-2016 academic year, just under 1,000 Classroom to Table meetings were arranged, according to Bisson. So far more than 300 meetings have been arranged this fall, on pace to surpass last year’s figures, she said.
“In the first month we probably had a dozen, in the second month we had two dozen,” Bisson said. “We’re at a point now where we have probably 200 requests a month right now, and it may grow further.”
Despite the rapid increase in requests, the Office of Undergraduate Education has worked to accommodate as many meal requests as possible.
“We bend over backwards to do what we can, but given the volume right now it’s hard,” Bisson said.
The program has also been a cause for traffic between Harvard affiliates and participating restaurants, which include Grafton Street, Legal Seafood, Park Restaurant, and Russell House Tavern, Bisson said.
“If you walk into Grafton Street at lunchtime on any given day during the semester, there are going to be tons of Classroom to Table groups,” she said.
Students have praised Classroom to Table and the personal relationships with professors the program allows them to develop.
“I felt like I was really good friends with my teachers in high school, and that’s harder to accomplish in college when classes are so much bigger,” Grace Pan ’20 said. “I think it’s a really good opportunity to get to know teachers, especially who are very prestigious, well-known professors who teach larger classes. I feel like, as a freshmen, something I’ve been wanting to get to do more is getting to know my professors.”
Michael Liu ’19 noted the growing awareness of the program among students.
“It’s almost become sort of like a verb, ‘We’re Classroom to Tabling right now,’” he said. “It’s definitely become more pervasive.”
Classroom to Table requests continued to follow their upward trajectory during the recent strike by Harvard’s dining services workers, increasing steadily without an unnatural spike, Bisson said.
“We were quite curious and apprehensive about whether we were going to be totally overwhelmed because of the strike,” she said, “but our sense is that we’ve seen an increase in numbers that we would have seen anyway. It was consistent with the growth we saw before.”

A new massive open online course will debut on HarvardX Monday, but with a special Halloween twist: the course is titled “Hamlet’s Ghost,” and explores not only the role of an unusual character in one of Shakespeare’s most famous plays, but also notions of death, ghosts, and the afterlife in both Shakespeare’s England and today.
Course organizers said the launch date is timely not only because it falls on Oct. 31, but also because 2016 marks the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death.
The course is taught by Shakespeare expert and University professor Stephen J. Greenblatt. Greenblatt, who first proposed the idea for the course to HarvardX developers in 2013, said he was interested in using virtual education platforms to bring Shakespeare, free of charge, to much larger audiences than traditional courses allow.
“I was interested in these issues of lifelong learning—what it means to bring material of this kind to a much broader group of people, no matter what age they are, where they are, or the educational level they’re at,” Greenblatt said. “In this case, people who might be interested in learning some more about Hamlet, about ghosts, about the general phenomenon of how people deal with the loss of loved ones.”
The course includes a module on the historical context in which the play was written and originally performed, taking students through a series of videos filmed at special locations across England including the reconstructed Globe Theatre in London.
In the course module, Greenblatt also visits a special exhibition hosted by the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford titled “Shakespeare’s Dead,” which, like the course, focuses on the theme of death in the works of Shakespeare.
“It was a perfect alignment of subject matter,” said Zachary S. Davis, a project lead at HarvardX who helped organize the course. “What it really shows is that there are some things, like inter-university collaboration, which are even more enabled through online courses.”
The online format also allowed producers to incorporate more conversations and dialogue into the course, according to Maria P. Devlin, a Ph.D. student in English who worked closely with Greenblatt on the course’s development.
“What you see in a lecture course is a professor giving you a reading of the play, but what you see in these videos is often two people having a conversation,” Devlin said. “And I think that’s a great way for students to see scholarship being done, that these ideas don’t just come out of nowhere—they come out of dialogue.”
Robert A. Lue, faculty director at HarvardX, said he is optimistic about the course's reception.
“Given that it’s Stephen Greenblatt, given that it’s Hamlet’s ghost, which is a particularly compelling character in all of Shakespeare, I would expect it would be popular,” he said.

In the two years since its reopening, the renovated Arts and Humanities Café at the Barker Center has regularly hosted a range of arts events, but students and cafe managers say the cafe’s aspiration to be a campus arts center has yet to fully catch on.
Brandon R. Tilley, the cafe’s program manager, said he has been working to promote the space to a network of people beyond the “artsy kids and English-major types” that he typically sees in the establishment. He said he hopes people will come to view the café “as a place where students and student groups can pitch their own performances.”
Tilley said the café hosts two to four open events per week, each with an average attendance of about 15 to 20 people. Common events include musical performances, open mic nights, and poetry readings. He said he wants to bring greater attendance to events at the café.
“Almost no event is as large as I would like it to be,” Tilley said. “Unless we’re packed to the gills, I always wish that there were more. I want there to be better name recognition.”
Some organizations that have used the space for events have reported having positive experiences.
On Oct. 11, the Harvard College Office of BGLTQ Student Life and Speak Out Loud held an open mic night at the café in recognition of National Coming Out Day.
Sheehan D. Scarborough, acting director of BGLTQ Student Life, and assistant director Khanh-Anh H. Le said they got the idea to host the event at the café unexpectedly through word-of-mouth but found it to be a good space for student engagement.
“The variety of seating at the café helped to create an intimate, casual feel,” Le said. “The physical space itself is also round, so it feels like you’re being embraced by the space.”
Other recent events at the Arts Café have included a Halloween-themed open mic night hosted by the Sloth and a live band performance by the Lighthouse Keepers.
According to Abigail L. Westover ’17, lead vocalist of the Lighthouse Keepers, the performance was well attended, with all seats filled by the end of the night. However, she said she believes awareness of the venue can still be increased.
“I think it’s still something that people don’t know about it. Especially if you’re not studying something where you’re in the Barker Center a lot,” Westover said.

With lines for Tatte Bakery and Cafe stretching out the door, students will now have another option for getting their coffee and croissant in Harvard Square with the opening of Flour Bakery this Tuesday.
The new bakery, which will be housed on 114 Mt. Auburn St., is owned by  Joanne B. Chang ’91, who started off her baking career in the kitchens of the Leverett House Grille, where she baked chocolate chip cookies during her junior and senior year. After graduating as an Applied Mathematics concentrator, she started a career in consulting but soon realized her true calling was baking.
“I love cooking,” Chang said. “I love eating and being around food.”
In 2000, she opened her first Flour location in the South End. Since then, she has opened up three more locations and plans to open up locations in Cambridgeport and Back Bay in the coming months.
Chang said Flour, which features an egg yolk as the "o" in the bakery’s logo, strives to bring “simple pleasures” to diners.
“The whole idea is that having the ‘o’ as a yolk brings you back to the idea that all of baking is simple in that it is a couple of ingredients that are put together really well to make something delicious,” Chang said. “The egg really symbolizes what we are all about: simple pleasures that make you happy.”
Flour serves a variety of bakery and cafe items including pastries, cakes, sandwiches, soups, and salads, though it is best known for its signature sticky buns.
“We spend a lot of time with the bakers and cooks talking about what we call the ‘mom test,’ which is making sure that everything you make is something that you would be proud to serve your mom,” Chang said.
The eatery’s main focus is hospitality, Chang said.
“We want to ensure that every guest who walks into the door feels happier when they leave than when they first walk in,” Chang said.
Chang said she deliberately decided to choose a storefront away from the center of Harvard Square to attract more customers who actively seek out Flour.
“I think that being a little bit set apart, you get the people who want to be at Flour—you get the people who are excited about what we serve, people who love the food, and people who want to be here,” Chang said.
Some students said they are looking forward to Flour’s opening.
“The last two summers I’ve worked in places really close to Flour and it became part of my daily routine so I’m really excited,” Soa H. Andrian ’17 said. “I really hope it is not as crowded as Tatte.”
Sali E. Yi ’18 echoed Andrian’s statement.
“I am so excited for Flour’s opening especially because I think it will reduce the traffic from Tatte,” Yi said. “I’m very excited for the hot foods like the asparagus sandwiches and the soups. The pastries are just in a league of its own.”

The Undergraduate Council will fund $1,000 worth of non-alcoholic “house-centered parties” this semester, due to a new Student Initiatives Committee policy.
This new “Everything But Alcohol” initiative is part of the Council’s effort to promote inclusive social spaces and House life, according to Student Initiatives Committee Chair Madeleine H. Stern ’18. Under the legislation, students will be able to apply for grants of up to $100 for food, decor, music, and other funding requests.
Some representatives raised concerns that $1,000 would be inadequate to provide sufficient funding to all Houses. Stern said that, if the grant works as the committee hopes, it may receive more funding in the future.
“We're allocating $1,000 for this semester only,” Stern said. “If this proves successful, SIC could take more money from its budget next semester or next year and make this a far larger thing.”
The legislation passed unanimously at the UC’s Sunday meeting. Stern also said a freshman-oriented version of the policy, spearheaded by the Freshman Class Committee, is in the works.
Also during the meeting, UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said she and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 will present to the Faculty Committee regarding the College’s policy that will penalize members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations beginning next fall. On Tuesday, they will give a two-minute speech to the Faculty Committee as part of the committee’s discussion over a motion against the sanctions. Earlier this month, Rather and Banks spoke to the Faculty Council on the issue.
During the UC’s Sunday meeting, the Council considered a piece of legislation which would have formally established a new agency within the UC to integrate Harvard’s branch of the Ivy Council—an organization consisting of student leaders across multiple Ivy League campuses—into the UC.
UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who endorsed the legislation, pointed to several examples of UC policy initiatives and proposals that were inspired by other schools’ student governments—including sexual assault prevention efforts and initiatives to provide feminine hygiene products.
Several representatives said working with the Ivy Council could help the UC with future policy.
“It's so important for the UC to have ties with what's going on,” Crimson Yard representative Nadine Khoury ’20 said. “We need to see how other student governments are functioning so we can improve ours.”
Due to concerns over both funding and the additional bureaucracy of adding another institution to the UC, the Council chose to table the legislation. The UC will consider the proposal again later next month, according to Rather.
While considering the UC’s weekly grants pack, Finance Committee Vice Chair of Policy Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 took issue with a $3,000 grant to fund an event by the Society of Arab Students. The group requested food funding for an estimated 500 undergraduates.
Boucher said it seemed statistically unlikely that 500 undergraduates would attend the event, and  proposed an amendment to cut the group’s grant by 80 percent to match the number of students likely to attend. Boucher’s amendment ultimately passed, as did the grants pack as a whole.
At the start of the meeting, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ President Kathleen C. Zhou ’17 spoke to the Council about the recent controversy surrounding the group’s production of “The Mikado.”
Zhou expressed concern about a letter, currently being drafted by some UC representatives, that she worried was unfair to her organization. The authors may release the letter—which will not be endorsed by the Council as a whole—as early as this week, after soliciting information from both sides of the controversy.

An enthusiastic audience filled the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Saturday afternoon to hear a conversation with former NBA player and bestselling author Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
During the conversation, which was moderated by professor of African and African American studies Henry Louis Gates Jr., Abdul-Jabbar addressed many concerns regarding the current state of racial relations in America.
Besides his legendary basketball career, Abdul-Jabbar has also done extensive work in philanthropy, acting, and African American and Muslim American activism. His latest book, “Writings on the Wall: Searching for a New Equality Beyond Black and White,” is a New York Times bestseller.
Gates began the event by arguing that, while America has a black President, African Americans still face significant discrimination.
“It’s the best of times for so many black people but it’s the worst of times for so many black people. We have a black man in the White House, but we still need Black Lives Matter,” he said.
Abdul-Jabbar said education was a key factor in determining whether or not African American youths can succeed.
“We have to figure out a way to help black parents who are struggling to get their kids educated and keep them out of the negative opportunities that are so abundant in the inner cities,” he said.
The conversation also touched on misconceptions some Americans may have about Islam. Abdul-Jabbar said that many Americans aren’t aware of how intertwined the history of Islam is with the history of Western civilization.
“Tell everybody how easy it is to do higher math with Roman numbers,” he joked, citing Arabic numbers as one of Islam’s many important contributions.
Abdul-Jabbar, who holds the all-time record for points scored in the NBA, further reflected on the growing number of athletes using their fame as a platform for social activism, and the unique potential sports heroes have for impressing the importance of creating positive change onto younger generations.
“Guys who have the opportunity to play sports have a great influence on young people and what they think about and the things that they pursue,” he said.
Abdul-Jabbar also encouraged audience members to step out of their comfort zones and get to know people who look different from them.
Many attendees said they were inspired by Abdul-Jabbar’s talk.
Robert Rush ’18 said that Abdul-Jabbar has helped many people move away from a black and white perspective on social issues and towards a more nuanced and informed view.
“We tend to look at things very superficially, which can cause long term problems as we move forward,” he said.
Assad Traina, a student at the School of Public Health, said he was glad to hear from a personal hero.

UPDATED: Nov. 2, 2016, at 11:05 p.m.
About 10 people gathered outside Agassiz Theater Friday evening to protest the opening night of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ “The Mikado,” a production some students say espouses inappropriate depictions of Japanese culture.
The comedic opera, written in 1884, satirizes British political culture and bureaucracy. In past renditions of the play performed around the world, non-Asian actors have portrayed Japanese characters, and critics have charged the play perpetuates exaggerated stereotypes of Japanese culture and people.
Harvard’s Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ rendition of “The Mikado” claims to grapple with controversial histories of western attitudes towards Japan. Their rendition takes place in a Las Vegas hotel as opposed to the fictional Japanese town of Titipu, and members of the theater troupe have sponsored teach-ins and town hall forums  to talk about racism in theater ahead of opening night.
George S. Qiao ’18 said although he recognized the group’s efforts to engage with the history of the production, he felt that they did not go far enough, arguing the show engages with Japanese history in an offensive manner.
Last week, Qiao called on the group to cancel “The Mikado,” penning a three-page document outlining his criticisms. In an interview Friday, he apologized, saying that “many of the initial statements I wrote were a bit too aggressive, a bit too emotional, feelings were hurt.”
All other protesters present at the show’s start time declined to comment.
The Gilbert and Sullivan Players, while welcoming students’ right to protest, have defended the show. The group’s president, Kathleen C. Zhou ’17, has argued that changing the production’s setting from a fictional Japanese town to a Las Vegas hotel better helped to “expose and critique the commodity racism and racial impersonation.”
Zhou also spoke at an Undergraduate Council meeting Sunday to defend “The Mikado.”
“We understand that the nature of this production is problematic and we have done some things to address that and we understand that we have not completely sanitized ‘The Mikado’ in any way,” said Trevor A. Mullin ’17, a Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ board member who helped produce the show.
Vivian L. Huang, a College fellow in Women and Gender Studies and Theatre, Dance, and Media who has taught about the intersection of performance art and race, gender, and ethnicity , attended “The Mikado” on its opening night Friday to “engage with the conversation its inspired” and to support some students of hers who were involved. She wrote in an email Sunday that she sympathized with student protesters, but that boycott was not necessarily the only or most effective form of protest.
“I can understand and support the impulse and act of protesting ‘The Mikado,’ especially when protesting invites dialogue and an expanded understanding of what's at stake in theater and performance where bodies are under explicit scrutiny,” she wrote.
Additionally, she wrote that “there are and historically have been other ways to stage resistance as well. It seems to me that the rhetoric of performance can be helpful here in interpreting boycott and rehearsal both as potential forms of political protest.”
Huang helped facilitate a teach-in with the Gilbert and Sullivan Players last week about “yellowface” in theater, and added that she plans to teach a course on the relationship between live performance and protest next semester. Ashley Zhou ’17, a Crimson design chair, organized the teach-in.
Huang added that she thought “there is no question” that the original Gilbert and Sullivan show draws upon “Orientalist ideology.” 
Hana Seita ’19, president of the Harvard Japan Society, said she personally felt “very offended, but not surprised” that a show she characterized as biased against Asian and Asian American students had been produced. Seita, who said she spoke only for herself, did not see “The Mikado,” and said she does not plan to in the future.
But Seita added she thought protests may generate unnecessary anger, and instead said she hoped “The Mikado” would start dialogue around issues of discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans.
Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan players last staged the show in the fall of 2012. In defending the show this year, Mullin encouraged people to “look at our version in 2016, and look at the steps we’ve taken to address the racial issues in contrast to the 2012 production, which was very rife with things that I personally find offensive in terms of race.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarifications and correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 1, 2016 
A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted postdoctoral fellow Vivian L. Huang as saying the campus production draws upon “Orientalist ideology.” In fact, she was referring to the original production.
CLARIFICATIONS: Nov. 1, 2016
A previous version of this article implied that Huang organized teach-ins ahead of the campus production of "The Mikado." In fact, she spoke at the teach-ins.
A previous version of this article also incorrectly implied that Britain had colonized Japan.

TEMPE, Ariz. — Tack on another touchdown for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
Behind another explosive showing from its senior-laden second line, the No. 13/13 Crimson took care of business out west for the second consecutive night in a 6-2 win Saturday night against Arizona State.
Harvard (2-0-0) was far from flawless—hence the missed point after—but seven nonfictional points from members of the second unit ultimately proved to be more than enough against the Sun Devils. Sean Malone logged two goals and an assist, Luke Esposito did the reverse, and Tyler Moy recorded a helper of his own.
“It was nice to see my line click all weekend,” said Esposito, dawning the Crimson’s Player of the Game hat after the contest. “Those guys are unbelievable—not just putting the puck in the net, but [with] the cycles we were able to establish and [keeping] the pressure on those guys.”
Although the game remained in hand for the majority of the night, no play from the second line proved more salient than one executed 3:50 into the third period.
Less than a minute prior, ASU (1-7-0) had struck gold for the first time all weekend, bringing the score to 3-1 with plenty of hockey remaining. But the Harvard second line needed just one rush to suck the momentum out of the building. Having gained a step on his defender, Malone cruised up the left wing and went stick-side high on sophomore goaltender Ryland Pashovitz to push the score to 4-1.
“Their response to [ASU’s] first goal was important,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “To get it right to a three-goal lead was a big turning point in the game.”
“All we could do is respond,” Malone said. “And we went right down and scored. Those are the responses you need if you’re going to win games.”
Malone’s first goal of the season was a welcoming sight for Donato, who had been critical of his team’s play late in the second period and early in the third, pointing specifically to slow defending and an increasing number of ‘long home run passes.’
Donato let his guys hear it, and the message did not go unreceived. Malone’s goal was the first of three for the Crimson in the third, as co-captain Devin Tringale scored two minutes later and Malone would eventually tack on another. Freshman Adam Fox delivered a lofting chip from his own zone to Tringale, who eluded a charging goaltender to poke in his first goal of the year. Then at 17:12, Malone finished five-hole from his backhand to cap the offensive outburst.
While Harvard certainly did more with its opportunities than the hosts, the Sun Devils actually outshot the Crimson in each of the last two periods. ASU finally saw its efforts pay off in the third when graduate student Robbie Baillargeon—a former Boston University Terrier—knocked in two separate rebounds in front of junior goaltender Merrick Madsen, perhaps giving the hosts something to build on as they march forward as perpetual underdogs in their first full Division I season.
“That’s a hell of a team,” ASU coach Greg Powers said. “But like I told our guys, I thought we were probably better the last 30 minutes tonight. If we can string together 60 minutes of playing that kind of hockey, we’re going to get some wins. We are.”
“But you have to do it for 60 against teams like Harvard,” he added. “You can’t do it for 30.”
The first 30 minutes were largely a continuation of Friday’s 7-0 rout, as the Crimson netted the night’s first three tallies. In an opening period where the two teams combined for eight penalties—and perhaps more impressively, seven varying infractions—Harvard quickly set the tone with a pair of power-play conversions. Junior Seb Lloyd tipped home a Clay Anderson drive at 12:09, and Esposito flipped a shot over the shoulder of Pashovitz from his left post at 17:39.
Assisting on both goals was sophomore defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy, who entered Saturday’s contest with none through his first 11 games of collegiate action. The blue line was clicking all weekend, not only putting together a 103-minute shutout streak to open the trip but also providing a touch of offense with one goal and 10 assists.
The lone goal of the second period belonged to junior Jake Horton, who received a feed from Lloyd in the slot and picked the top right corner of the net at 5:40 to put the Crimson up 3-0.
That scoreline ultimately ballooned into a 6-2 final, but given the state of the Sun Devils, the result was hardly unexpected. Yet, the weekend series was designed to serve a variety of purposes: For Harvard, to test out its new-look lines and pairings ahead of its ECAC opener next weekend. For ASU, to host more premier competition and further legitimize its growing program.
“We’re so thankful and incredibly grateful to their coaching staff—Coach Donato and Pearl,” Powers said. “In our first full year to have such a historic, successful program come out here when we don’t have a permanent home yet and you deal with two different venues, it speaks to how classy they are and that program is.”

This past weekend, the Harvard men’s lightweight crew team traveled to Lake Carnegie, in Princeton, N.J., to compete in the annual Princeton Chase regatta. Taking place over the course of two and three-quarter miles, the Crimson entered boats in the varsity eight race, the varsity four race, and the freshmen four race.
Throughout the regatta, every member of the lightweight team participated in one of the races.
Harvard’s first boat raced by the competition for first place in the varsity four race with a time of 14:54.27, almost 10 seconds quicker than second-place Penn. The Crimson’s second and third boats came in 10th and 11th, respectively, with two seconds separating the two.
“This weekend showed that we’ve made a ton of progress over the last few weeks,” sophomore Chris Jarrett said.
Harvard’s fourth boat finished 24th, and its fifth boat at 26th.
In the varsity eight race, Harvard’s first boat claimed fourth place with 13:19.01, edging the Navy’s first boat out by just half a second. Cornell took first, with Penn and Yale coming in the second and third spots, respectively.
“Billy Boyce, our new head coach, has been working us harder and developing us more than ever and we’re really starting to see the fruits of that labor. We’re coming off the water a little bit faster every day and after a few years of disappointing showings the team is hungry for trophies,” Jarrett said.
Harvard’s second boat came in 12th with a time of 13:39.17, and its third boat took 16th at 13:44.34. The final boat came in 22nd with 14:16.49.
“Our second, third, and fourth varsity 8s all performed better than expected,” Jarrett said.
The all-freshmen race gave the Crimson’s freshmen some good experience on the river as the fall season comes to a close. While Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth claimed the top three spots, Harvard’s first boat came in seventh of 21 with 14:10.31.
The final race of the season is the Foot of the Charles on Nov. 13, after which the team will begin preparing for the spring season.
“Princeton Chase was our last race against competition we’ll face next semester,” Jarrett said. “So, right now we’re just focused on getting in a productive training season so we can give it a good rip come spring.”

After winning last week’s contest against Dartmouth to open the second half of its conference slate, the Crimson was unable to keep the momentum rolling, dropping both of its weekend games and officially falling out of contention for the Ivy League title after earning a share of the top spot the last two seasons.
“We played hard,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We were really disciplined. It just came down to a few points.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 2
Entering Saturday’s contest against the Crimson, Princeton had won its last 25 sets against Ivy League opponents.
The Tigers had not dropped a set in Ivy League play since Sept. 24, when it lost the fourth set to Penn in its five-set victory in the conference opener.
That changed on Saturday afternoon.
While the Crimson eventually fell to the Tigers, Harvard forced a five-set match—a moral victory for a squad filled with promising youth that will be tasked with bringing the Crimson back to title contention in the years upcoming.
Harvard had a chance to steal the fifth set away from Princeton to hand the Tigers their first loss of the conference season. Down 10-8, co-captain Corie Bain sent a strike over the net to close the deficit to one. But two kills, two Harvard errors, and a Tigers’ block sealed the fate of the Crimson.
“We kept our composure,” Weiss said. “That’s what you have to do. Volleyball’s such a game of momentum. For that to be such a battle, it’s one of those ones you could be proud of.”
Facing the possibility of a two-set deficit earlier in the match—trailing 23-22 in the second-set—sophomore Christina Cornelius registered two straight kills to give the Crimson a one-point advantage. Freshman libero Isabelle Tashima commenced the next point with her serve, which Cara Mattaliano was unable to return, officially hand Princeton its first set loss in over a month.
“Realizing if a team earns a point you earn one right back, that’s exactly how we have to play all the time,” Weiss said. “So when you can get them to dial in and do that, we’ll find success, and that’s what we did tonight.”
Cara Mattaliano—who is currently leading the conference in kills per set with more than three-and-a-half, and, as a result, is a presumed favorite to repeat as Ivy League Player of the Year—was a driving force of the Princeton attack. She teamed up with Maggie O’Connell for 39 combined kills.
Bain provided the offensive spark for the Crimson on Saturday. She recorded 20 kills on 43 total attacks, which was a season high for the three-time All-Ivy First Team member. Cornelius followed right behind with 14 kills while adding a block and four block assists as well.
“Corie played awesome, aggressive,” Weiss said. “Everyone stayed aggressive. We stuck with our defensive system. We did a lot of great things.”
PENN 3, HARVARD 0
The narrative of Harvard’s season has been that it has been able to hang around with most teams, but has been prone to falling just short at the end of matches. The story continued on Friday.
In all three sets in the straight-set loss to the Quakers, the Crimson found itself down 20-19. Despite being in contention in the late stages of each frame, Harvard wasn’t able to take a set from Penn. From that point on, the Quakers outscored the Crimson 15-9 to, for the time being, force a tie between the two teams at fourth place in the Ivy League standings.
After losing the first two sets of the match, the Crimson jumped out to an 11-4 lead behind kills from four different players in hopes of jumpstarting a three-set comeback. But within a few points, that lead shrank to one behind six straight points from the Quakers. From there, the teams traded points until the Quakers eventually pulled away, 25-22.
Freshman Grace Roberts Burbank led the offensive attack for Harvard in both total attacks and kills, tallying 22 and 11, respectively. Courtney Quinn of the Quakers led both teams with 13 kills.
Cornelius and freshman Maclaine Fields played a major role at the net, tallying six and five block assists on the night, which were both their second-highest outputs of the season. Bain and sophomore Jocelyn Meyer also contributed four and three, respectively.

The Harvard women’s rugby team recorded its second straight shutout and its third of the season in Saturday’s Ivy League Tier 1 semi-final match against Princeton. The Crimson (6-1, 4-1 Ivy) handily took care of the visiting Tigers (3-3, 2-3) by a score of 55-0 to advance to next week’s conference finale.
The Harvard squad came focused and prepared to make a statement in its first playoff match, as evidenced by the Crimson’s passionate yet composed play.
“We were really ready to play,” senior Claire Collins said. “The intensity was really high and we maintained a high level of [it] throughout the match.”
Freshman Emily Prentice also chimed in on her team’s high-stakes playoff mindset: “Our focus was playing to our full potential,” she said, “and so we were able to not get in our own heads about what this game was or who the other team was.”
With the decisive victory, Harvard extended its win streak to three matches while remaining a perfect 3-0 at home this season. Princeton, on the other hand, drops below .500 in Ancient Eight competition and moves to 3-3 for the year.
“[The match was] the coming together of a lot of the aspects we’ve been working on throughout our season,” Prentice said. “We had a really intense offensive focus, but defensively we shut [Princeton] out which is huge.”
Having clinched home field advantage for the entirety of the Ivy League playoffs, the Crimson put on another impressive show at the recently renovated Mignone Field. A total of eight Harvard players tallied on the score sheet, with Collins, Prentice, and freshman Delia Hellander each contributing a pair of tries.
“Everyone really got involved in the game,” Collins acknowledged, “and everyone was stepping up. When there was space in front of them, everyone was aggressive…and that meant that lots of people were scoring tries.”
After a Prentice try started the scoring for the Crimson, the home team’s intensity never wavered. Collins, recording back-to-back tries in the first half, did her damage to the Princeton defense shortly thereafter. A score from freshman Cydnee Colpaert concluded the Crimson’s early barrage of tries, and by the end of the first half, Harvard had skewed the match by a lopsided 25-0 score.
The second frame opened with close to 20 minutes of close, hard-fought rugby, resulting in no scoring from either side. Nevertheless, the Crimson found a second wind and rattled off six tries to boost its advantage to an unmatchable 55 points.
“On attack, we were well aligned,” Collins said. “There were always people ready for the pass, and the people catching the ball were really exploding onto [it]…which meant that we were able to stay on the front foot.”
Keeping a heavy foot on the offensive pedal was crucial to Harvard’s blanking of the Tigers. The Crimson’s stingy and physical defense, however, cannot be overlooked as a major theme of the match. Some players cited a strong scrum and dominating possession as key factors in the success of Saturday’s match.
“Honestly, [the Tigers] can’t score when they don’t have the ball, and so we were really adamant about keeping possession,” Collins said. “Rugby’s not like football – [changing possession] is not automatic – so we had to work hard every time there was a tackle to make sure we maintained possession.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team has not lost in ten games, and its consistency has been rewarded with a new place at the top of the Ivy League table with just one game left to play.
On Saturday at Burnham field, the Crimson (9-3-3, 4-0-2 Ivy) shut out last-place Dartmouth, 2-0, behind goals from senior forwards Rachel Garcia and Midge Purce, along with senior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack’s second straight shutout, to gain another three points in the standings.
The Big Green (6-6-2, 0-4-2) got several attempts on goal off in the early parts of both halves, but Harvard’s defense was able to withstand the pressure.
“I don’t think we were able to find our rhythm early in the game, but I’m really proud of how the team managed to make little adjustments,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We just got better as the game went on.”
Garcia struck first with her fifth goal of the season off of a well-placed corner kick by sophomore Leah Mohammadi in the 37th minute. Garcia, second on the team with fourteen points, continued her offensive production in the second half with an assist to Purce in the middle third that opened up a path to the goal.
With four defenders converging, Purce ran through the entirety of the Big Green defense in the 63rd minute and fired her eleventh goal of the season into the top left corner to extend the lead to 2-0.
“Midge’s second goal was a great goal—really great goal, both collectively and individually,” Hamblin said. “It gave us that separation that we were able to hang on to in the end.”
The star forward gave credit to the fundamental soccer that the team played whilst holding onto a 1-0 lead.
“I believe it was built up from the back,” Purce said. “It was composure all around, so I think for all of us to settle it down, play on the ground, get back to playing good soccer—it was really good to score a goal off of that.”
The highlight-reel goal was Purce’s 41st of her career and her 26th point of the season.
It also played a huge role in turning the momentum around in the midst of Dartmouth’s early second-half surge. Being scored on, after having a few solid attempts on goal, perhaps deflated the Big Green sideline.
“We have a lot of faith in each other, no matter how the game’s going,” Purce said. “Everyone just kind of put their head down, and they were like, let’s relax, and let’s play good soccer like we know how to.”
The star of the game very well might have been the staunch Crimson defense. Durack made two saves, both of which came in the early goings of each half, and tallied her fifth shutout of the season.
“Our defending was great, and I think that’s been a big part of our mentality,” Hamblin said. “[Dartmouth] did have some chances—but I think we limited them to mainly chances on set pieces. I’m really pleased with the way we’ve been able to keep teams off the board, which always gives us a chance.”
The effectiveness of the back line—led by senior co-captain Bailey Gary and junior defender Candy Janachowski—has been nothing new for Harvard.
“When we came into preseason, one of the themes we had was defending; it was going to be a focus for us this year,” Hamblin said. “We’ve played three at the back most of the season, and left ourselves to be exposed, but the individual defending across the field, from our forwards, midfielders, and our backs, has been first-class. I think that showed again today.”
With the solid-all around effort, the Crimson remains undefeated within the conference, racking up 14 points in six games, and is now 7-0-3 in its last ten games. The Big Green, meanwhile, remains winless in Ivy play and remains at the bottom of the table with two points.
Combined with Columbia’s loss to Yale on Saturday, Harvard takes over the top of the table by one point. The Crimson controls its own destiny when it takes on the second place Lions at home next weekend—a win or draw guarantees an Ivy League title for the Harvard squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Led by an individual victory by junior Courtney Smith and top-10 performances by three freshman, the Harvard women’s cross country team took home its first Ivy League Heptagonal Championship since 1985. This historic victory was Harvard’s seventh overall title in program history and Smith’s title is Harvard’s first since Suzanne Jones took home gold in 1989.
Running on the same course at Princeton University earlier this season, Courtney Smith won the Harvard-Yale-Princeton race, making her a clear contender for the Championship win. However, at the H-Y-P meet, Harvard struggled to outrun Yale, making it the underdog for the Ivy League Overall Title.
“Today was just kind of a bonus reward. It’s what we do everyday—all the hours we've put in, all the hard workouts we've done, all the strength and injury prevention—because we love the process itself,” Smith said. “We love what we do regardless of the results. But it still really nice to see it pay off and we're so proud to represent Harvard to the best of our ability.”
Finishing with a time of 20:19.6, Smith beat Penn’s Ashley Montgomery to win by a margin of over ten seconds. Emily Waligurski of Yale came in third with a time of 20:36.4, closely followed by Brown’s Taylor Worthy and Harvard freshman Erin Dietz, who both crossed the finish at 20.37.8. Also scoring for Harvard were two other freshman Judy Pendergast in sixth and Lisa Tertsch in ninth as well as junior Elianna Shwayder in 12th.
“I just needed to go out, take cues from Erin, stick with her even if the hurt set in early, and beat people from Yale and Penn,” Shwayder said. “The 2k between the 3200 and the 5k are pretty much a blur. I remember pushing with Lisa, but a bit of a gap forming from Erin. I was fatigued, but so dialed into and engaged in the race. I didn't care how I felt physically. I just knew I needed to get the job done for the team.”
Sophomore Kevin Tuntivate and senior captain Brandon Price led the men’s team with a pair of top-20 finishes. Tunitivate finished the 8K course with a time of 24:16.8, crossing the finish line in 18th. Price closely followed with a time of 24.19.8 to finish in 20th, his best Heps finish in his Harvard career.
Like the women’s team, the Harvard freshman men made strong showings at their first Ivy League Heptagonal Championship meet. Freshmen Murimi Nyamu and Will Battershill finished in 62nd and 68th respectively.
James Randon of Yale won the individual crown, while Penn, Princeton and Columbia took the top three overall spots.
“All of my teammates have worked tremendously hard this season,” sophomore Malia Ellington said. “This team is dedicated to doing all the little things right, and for the women it was incredible to watch them pull off a Heps victory.”
“As soon as I crossed the finish line, I knew we had won. I started crying tears of joy. Pure bliss,” Shwayder said. “This is the process we have been trusting and today, we clicked.”

The No. 13 Harvard men’s water polo team pulled out two crucial conference victories this weekend over MIT and No. 10 Brown to improve its record to 5-2 in the Northeast Water Polo Conference. The Crimson took down MIT for the second time this season while defeating Brown in overtime after a close loss to the Bears at home a few weeks earlier.
“We played really well,” sophomore Grant Harvey said. “Last time we played these two teams, MIT and Brown, they were in our house and we didn’t play well at all. We kind of took MIT for granted last time and they came out and gave us a game and we decided that that was not going to happen again. From the very first whistle we had this determination to embarrass them in their own house in front of their own fans because of how last game went.”
HARVARD, 9, BROWN, 8
The Crimson took down a ranked opponent for the eighth time this season with its overtime win over the Bears this weekend. The team is now 2-0 in overtime games this year.
Harvard carried over the momentum from its crushing defeat of MIT to the first half of play against Brown. The team entered intermission up 5-3 thanks to two goals from senior Noah Harrison in the second quarter..
“When we headed to Brown we were riding the energy off of MIT and once again with the anger of losing in our house in front of our own fans. We went out there and set the tone,” Harvey said.
In the third quarter, the Bears narrowed their deficit to one as freshman Austin Sechrest recorded the only Harvard goal of the quarter to bring the score to 6-5 in favor of Harvard.
Sophomore Nick Bunn collected his second goal of the game in the fourth quarter while Sechrest scored in the last 15 seconds of regulation play to tie up the game at eight and force overtime.
In the first period of overtime, Sechrest connected with senior Dan Stevens who delivered a shot from the two-meter line for the game-winning goal. Harvard’s defense was able to shut the Bears down for the entire length of the extra session to secure the 9-8 victory.
“Brown was the main focus so we came out and our team was really strong and so everyone was really happy,” sophomore Nathan Ondracek said. “ It was really exciting to win in overtime; it was crazy. A lot of good vibes on the team right now.”
HARVARD, 12, MIT, 3
The last time Harvard faced off against MIT this year the entire match was neck and neck until the Crimson ultimately pulled ahead in the second half of play to win it, 11-8. This time around Harvard was determined to not let it get that close.
The Crimson jumped out to an early 5-0 lead in the first frame of play against the Engineers. The five goals were distributed amongst five players highlighting the depth of Harvard’s offense. By the end of the first half the Crimson increased its lead to 9-1 and ultimately rolled to a dominating 12-3 victory.
Sechrest led the Harvard offense with four goals of his own, while Harrison also impressed with a hat trick. Junior Colin Chiapello also notched two scores.
Between the posts, sophomore Anthony Ridgley tied his career high of 15 saves while also chipping in a game-high four assists. Freshman Nikhil Suri also stopped four shots in the net to keep the Engineers  to help secure the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in a dozen years, the Harvard field hockey team can call itself the Ancient Eight champions.
A natural hat trick by freshman phenom Bente van Vlijmen in the span of just over 12 minutes helped the No. 16 Crimson (11-5, 6-0 Ivy) take home a 3-1 triumph against conference bottom feeder Dartmouth (4-11, 0-6 Ivy). The win, paired with Princeton’s loss to Cornell that same day, assured the crown would return to Cambridge for the first time since 2004.
After a scoreless first stanza that saw Harvard dominate the Big Green in shots by a 13-2 margin, van Vlijmen opened up the scoring just five minutes into the second frame as the freshman’s shot made its way through Dartmouth keeper Haley Valerio’s legs. It was the first time Valerio was unable to keep the ball out after making nine saves in the first half.
Nine minutes later, it was van Vlijmen again off of a penalty corner after being set up by sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte. The freshman completed her natural hat trick just three minutes later after single handedly dribbling to the left and sending a shot past Valerio. The Ziest, the Netherlands native’s hat trick was the first in her collegiate career and sent the Crimson well on its way to the title.
Dartmouth prevented Harvard from picking up a clean sheet when junior captain Morgan Philie found the back of the net but it was too little too late for the Big Green. The goal was the only blemish for Harvard netminders Libby Manela and Olivia Startup, who were only made to make one save each.
With the Ivy title secure thanks to the team’s 11th victory this season, the highest win count under Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden’s, the Crimson closes its regular season at home against Columbia on Senior Day. The team will then wait until the NCAA Selection Show on November 6 to figure out where it will play in the NCAA Tournament as the Ancient Eight’s automatic qualifier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing ranked teams for the first time this season, the Harvard women’s hockey team (1-2, 1-2 ECAC) had trouble channeling its offense on this weekend’s road trip.
Harvard 0, St. Lawrence 4
The No. 7/6 Saints (7-0-1, 2-0-0) took the lead early in the game and never looked back, going on to shut out the Crimson Saturday afternoon.
Within the first 30 seconds of play, St. Lawrence right wing Kennedy Marchment was able to break through Harvard’s defense and score at the 25 second mark, assisted by teammates Brooke Webster and Kristen Padalis.
From that point on, the Saints dominated both sides of the ice, going on to score four goals in total while keeping the Crimson’s offense at bay and holding it scoreless for the remainder.
Marchment continued to be the center of attention for St. Lawrence’s offense, as she went on to score two more goals, resulting in a hat trick for the junior. The Saints’ fourth goal came off the stick of senior defender Alex Moore off of a power play late in the first period. Moore also had an assist on Marchment’s second goal at the 16:12 mark of the second period.
On the Harvard side of the ice, things were relatively quiet, with the team amassing only 19 shots on goal during the 90 minutes of play. Senior left wing Sydney Daniels and junior forward Lexie Laing each lead the team in shots with four, while freshman forward Kat Hughes added three of her own.
The first period was riddled with penalties for the Crimson, with five different players called for infractions during the first 17 minutes of play. Only one Harvard penalty resulted in a power play goal for the Saints, who totaled five penalties on the day as well. The Crimson was able to outplay St. Lawrence of face offs, winning 26-of-44 in the contest.
Harvard 0, No. 8/8 Clarkson 4
Kicking off the team’s road games, Harvard played a tough first period of hockey in Potsdam, NY, with neither team scoring in the opening 20 minutes of play.
The Golden Knights (6-3-1, 2-0-0) came back from the first intermission ready to attack, which was made apparent by the goal scored within the first three minutes of play back on the ice.
At the 2:49 mark, senior forward Cayley Mercer was able to break the stalemate with help from teammates Loren Gabel and Michaela Pejzlova. The same trio came together again in the final minute of the period to put Clarkson up 2-0 going into the second intermission.
In the net for Harvard was senior Molly Tissenbaum, who suffered her first loss of the season on the back of a 33 save performance.
The Golden Knights put up their first power play goal of the night halfway through the third period when sophomore forward Rhyen McGill found the back of the net. Clarkson put the last nail in the coffin later in the game, when the last goal was scored by senior forward Jessica Gillham.

Last season, the Harvard men’s soccer team was left in shock on its own sideline after an overtime goal by then-freshman Amadu Kunateh gave Dartmouth a 1-0 win at Jordan Field and essentially sealed the Ivy title for the Big Green. This year, however, the Crimson exacted revenge.
Playing on the road at Dartmouth’s Burnham Field, junior midfielder Sam Brown’s 25 yard screamer in the 80th minute gave Harvard (10-3-2, 4-0-1 Ivy) a 1-0 victory over Dartmouth (5-4-5, 3-1-1). With the win, the Crimson gained sole possession of first place in the Ancient Eight standings and are in control of their own fate with two weeks to go.
“It was an unbelievable game, one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of in my four years here.” senior defender Alex Leondis said. “It was an overall great game and we’re happy to come away with what we wanted because we competed and fought for each other.”
With just over ten minutes left in the game, freshman midfielder Matthew Glass attempted to dribble into the Big Green box and play a 1-2 with senior forward Pieter Zenner before deciding to lay it back to Brown.
The Ann Arbor, Mich. native took a touch to set it on his left foot before belting a low shot from 25 yards out towards the bottom right corner, where a diving Dartmouth goalie James Hickok was unable to save it. The goal was Brown’s first of the season and couldn’t have come at a better time for Harvard.
“We’ve seen Sam hit balls all year in training and even in games where he’s just gotten unlucky that they haven’t hit the back of the net,” senior forward Jake Freeman said. “It was almost as though he was due for it...we expect him to stay after that even though it hadn’t shown up in the score sheet.”
Going into the game, the Crimson knew it was in for a scrappy battle against a Big Green team allowing less than a goal per game. With this matchup going a long way to decide the conference title over the past few years, it was clear both teams were going to make the other work for any opportunities as opposed to allowing for a high-pressing, attacking clash.
Dartmouth claimed the first chance in the 17th minute, as junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks was unable to handle a cross from midfielder Justin Donawa but the Big Green was unable to take advantage as junior defender Justin Crichlow cleared it before any harm could be done.
Sophomore forward Cesar Farias had the best first half opportunity for Harvard, who outshot the Big Green by a 3-2 margin in the opening stanza, but was unable to bury the ball past Hickok.
The Crimson were lucky to not find themselves behind in the opening minute of the second frame, as midfielder Justin Nierneberg sprung the offside trap after being played through by fellow midfielder Noah Paravicini. The junior sent a shot at the far post after Parks came out early but was unable to find the back of the net despite getting the ball past the Harvard goalkeeper.
Nierenberg had an almost identical opportunity in the 69th minute after Donawa’s through ball made its way past the backline but his curling shot past Parks once again ran just outside the post, maintaining a 0-0 draw.
Ten minutes later, the Big Green was left to regret its unseized opportunities when Brown’s goal sent the Crimson sideline into a frenzy, a much different mood than a year before.
“Obviously there’s the redemption and revenge factor and it felt even better to go into their place and really just put in a great performance like this and play them off the field.” Freeman said. “It gets us one step closer to our goal, that’s really what’s most important.”
The win means Harvard finishes its five game road trip with a perfect record and now sits in the perfect position to claim coach Pieter Lehrer’s first Ancient Eight crown. With two games left, the Crimson sit a top the Ivy League with a 4-0-1 mark, good for 13 points, while Columbia and Dartmouth are drawn for second at 3-1-1, good for ten.
With the Lions coming to town this weekend, a win would secure the title for Harvard regardless of its result against Penn on the last weekend. Despite the possibility to secure the team’s first Ivy title since 2009 next weekend, Freeman insists the Crimson will not be blinded by the storyline but instead be focused solely on preparing for Columbia, treating the game as it if were like any other clash this season.
“This is just the next game up and we’re going to prepare like we do every week.” Leondis said. “We’re going to compete and enjoy it and if we do that we’ll put ourselves in a position to hopefully win [the Ivy title] this weekend at home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 20th ranked coed and 15th ranked women’s Harvard sailing teams competed in three regattas this weekend, headlined by two fifth place finishes in the Victorian Coffee Urn and Erwin Schell Trophy.
VICTORIAN COFFEE URN
The Crimson sailed against 14 other fleets in FJ boats on the Thames River in New London, Conn., outplacing Ivy rivals Dartmouth and Brown to finish tied for fourth with the U.S. Coast Guard Academy with a final total of 164 points. Yale won the regatta with 124 points.
Harvard performed well in both the A and B divisions, scoring 78 and 86 points, respectively. Juniors,  skipper Taylor Ladd and crew Kirstin Anderson, led the Crimson to a fourth-place result in the A division, consistently placing in the middle of the pack throughout the two-day regatta.
Harvard placed 7th in the B division. Their two days were marked by inconsistency—out of 12 races, senior crew Emma Wheeler, sophomore skipper Taylor Gavula, and freshman crew Jessica Williams posted five top three finishes, but were plagued by five results in the bottom four.
Saturday’s conditions were ideal with an eight to twelve knot southwest breeze and sunny skies. Sunday proved to be more difficult, as the breeze frequently failed to fill, causing a couple races to be completed northwesterly, while the rest were completed in southerly breezes ranging from six to eight knots.
ERWIN SCHELL TROPHY
This regatta was also hosted by the Coast Guard on the Thames, as Harvard cruised to fifth-place finish out of 18 teams in the Schell.
Sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and senior crew Julia Lord performed especially well on Saturday in the B division, winning two of the six races that day. However, 16th and 18th place finishes to end the day in the final two races on Sunday were costly, ending with a final total of 86 points.
Harvard’s A division boat, sailed by junior co-captain and skipper Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Christine Gosioco finished tied for fourth with Boston University with a total of 73 points.
Overall, the Crimson finished 53 points behind first-place Yale with a total of 159 points.
NICKERSON TROPHY
The Tufts hosted regatta began on Saturday with near perfect conditions on Mystic Lake. Eight to twelve knot winds blowing from the south-southwest with minimal shifts contributed to a great day of racing. Sunday began with five knot winds that gradually built over the course of the day.
Both boats in the A and B divisions struggled this weekend, posting an overall eighth-place finish out of 17 teams. Freshman skipper Sofia Marie Mascia and freshman crew Victoria Marquez’s 57 points in the A division led the Crimson to a tie for sixth-place with the University of Rhode Island. They finished the weekend strong with back-to-back third place finishes in the final two races on Sunday. In the B division, freshmen Catherine Kerner and Juan Crestanello finished with 82 points, good for 11th place.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Or... the most anxiety-inducing time, depending on your disposition toward interacting with potential love interests. Crawl out of your Lamont carrel and start dressing cuter for your class crush. Cuffing season is upon us.
What exactly is cuffing season?November 1st marks the start of cuffing season. Now that promiscuous Halloweekend festivities are over, you probably never feel like going out again and instead yearn to settle down with a steady mate. An ever reputable source for what the kids are doing, Urban Dictionary explains this seasonal phenomenon as such: “cold weather and prolonged indoor activity cause singles to become lonely and desperate to be cuffed.” Because Harvard students contend with plenty of “cold weather and prolonged indoor activity,” it’s natural to experience cuffing propensities.
How does one successfully cuff?Step one: identify prime cuffing material. Who you aim to cuff is not the same person who caught your beer-goggled eye during Opening Days. Qualities to look for: good looking enough to co-star in your Harvard-Yale Insta for an inevitable couple debut, accepting of the insulating blubber you’ve put on for the winter, and financially stable (because you’re mostly in it for the obligatory holiday present). Whether you choose to rekindle a former or ongoing flame, or summon the courage to chat up someone new, go forth boldly and nobly in your quest. Unapologetically flirt, take up any and all date offers (the P-sets can wait), and even settle a little. If the going gets tough, get going, and download a dating app—you can’t wait ‘til Datamatch.
Nota bene: apps are a last resort. Nonetheless, you must press on with an end goal in mind. Just imagine finally having someone to coyly mention at the Thanksgiving dinner table when your wine-drunk relatives’ prying inquiries about your love life unavoidably commence. (Even if it’s just Kevin from Tinder).
When is cuffing season over?Typically, the tied-down joys of cuddling and Burdick dates taper off by February 15th, when Western society denotes it acceptable to be alone again. If you make it past V-Day, chances are your relationship will wither by spring midterms. But if your cold-weather S.O. is financially solvent (read: already has a finance offer lined up, courtesy of early recruiting), have them put a ring on it before April 18th to reap in those tax benefits (cha-ching). Congratulations, you’re officially set for life. Happy cuffing, folks.

The fact that trick-or-treating becomes socially awkward at a certain age can be frustrating. With midterms (for the most part) behind us, Harvard students deserve some free candy now more than ever. For all those craving some Halloween fun, there are plenty of places in the Square that can satisfy your sweet and spooky desires.
Tonight on Halloween night, all cares about cavities and calorie intake go out the window. Who needs to eat in the dining hall when you can start the evening off right by collecting free candy and buying some delicious desserts? Dado Tea will be giving out candy to those who stop by (we’re sure they would prefer if you bought some tea as well, but again, tea might be a little too healthy tonight). Everyone’s favorite El Jefe’s Taqueria will not only be serving quesadillas and nachos on Halloween, but will also be serving pumpkin horchata and their choco flan in festive colors. Next on your route is Liquiteria. Stopping by before 7 p.m. in costume will earn you a 20% discount on any purchase (saving some of that new #CrimsonCash), and the store is also offering candy to trick-or-treaters. Whether the term “trick-or-treaters” includes hungry college students wearing bunny ears has yet to be determined.
For more freebies, Origins will be handing out some “spooktacular” gift bags (not quite sure what that entails but, regardless, feel free to check it out). Salt & Olive will be giving out even more candy, as well as candy’s most perfect complement: hot sauce (?!?!). For the more daring among us, the restaurant will serve hot sauce samples in flavors like “Zombie Repellant” and “Dragon Repellent.” To finally satiate your hunger, hit up Shake Shack for (you guessed it) more free candy. The burger place will also be serving its specialty drink, the Shackenstein Milkshake: a boo-tiful blend of vanilla milkshake, chocolate cake bits, and marshmallow.
Once you’ve loaded up with candy for the night, you’ll be ready for that scary movie. Resist the urge to watch Netflix in your room (we’ve all done enough of that), and instead take the short walk to the Brattle Theater at 6 p.m. to enjoy a free showing of Bride of Frankenstein (if you’re already at Shake Shack, this should be less than a minute away). Later that night, at 8:30pm, the theater will be playing the classic film, Halloween. What better way to spend the night than with friends, in a vintage theater, watching Michael Myers [SPOILER ALERT] come back to life again and again, … and again.
Finally, don’t be afraid to spend the day in your costume. It’ll make the “trick-or-treat” experience around the Square much more realistic, and will garner you some respect (a few odd looks, but mainly respect) everywhere you go.
Happy Halloween from all of us at Flyby!
