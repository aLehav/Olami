The Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra will get its first new leader in 45 years on July 1, the Office for the Arts and Harvard’s Music Department announced last week.Federico Cortese—now leader of the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra and the New England String Ensemble—will replace James Yannatos, who first joined the HRO in 1964.An eight-member conductor search committee composed of students, faculty, and other stakeholders appointed Cortese to the post from a field of nearly 200 applicants.“The voices of the students in the orchestra were paramount in everything that we were doing,” said Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts and co-chairman of the search committee. The top candidates auditioned for the orchestra by planning and leading an HRO rehearsal.“[Collecting student feedback] was a very deliberate, thoughtful, and extensive process for hearing what students had to say about rehearsal,” Megan added, citing written surveys of orchestra members, lunch-interviews, and orchestra-wide forums that were organized to gauge student opinion.“Cortese’s charismatic nature and ability to engage and work with all aspects of the orchestra were breathtaking,” said HRO violinist and search committee member Catherine D. Buzney ’09. “He treated us like professionals, demanding that we push ourselves to achieve a new level of muscianship that is challenging but very much within the capability of the HRO.”Cortese, who formerly served as assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, said he “understands the dynamics of a student orchestra and how to most effectively work with students who are incredibly dedicated to music but also [have] other academic and extracurricular commitments,” Buzney said. In fact, some current HRO members once played for Cortese as members of the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra and credit him with motivating them to continue playing music in college. Buzney also mentioned that Cortese, who fulfills conducting engagements worldwide and has extensive experience planning tours for the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra, is especially eager to increase the number of HRO performing tours and to bolster the orchestra’s national and international presence.“We were looking for a person who could connect with undergraduates and challenge them on a personal basis... Cortese is the perfect match for an orchestra that is craving to be taken to higher levels,” said former HRO president Christine L. Barron ’09. “We anticipate a powerful commitment to musical excellence and student teaching, as Federico Cortese continues to build upon and expand the strong foundation that Dr. Yannatos has established for the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra over the past 45 years,” said current HRO president Eugene W. Lee ’09.In addition to his conducting responsibilities with HRO, Cortese will also teach one course per semester as a senior lecturer in the music department, according to department spokesperson Nancy Shafman.  —Staff writer Monica S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some humanities professors are concerned about what the administration’s “reshaping” might mean for the future of the University’s academic organization and resources.
As the process gets under way, professors could only speculate, but said that they are focused on preserving the autonomy of the University’s small departments, maintaining the size of its faculty, and ensuring the well-being of its libraries.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith recently appointed six working groups to oversee what he has called the “reshaping” of different sections of FAS, which is set to run an annual deficit of over $143 million that administrators hope to close by July 2011. According to University President Drew G. Faust, the purpose of the working groups is to come up with ideas for “structural changes,” which could include “better ways of sharing” administrative duties.
A humanities faculty member, who requested anonymity because the names have not been announced yet, said that the faculty members of the humanities working group are Homi Bhabha, James Engell, Anne C. Shreffler, Thomas B. F. Cummins, Jan M. Ziolkowski, and Humanities Divisional Dean Diana Sorensen, who will chair the working group.
Stephanie Sandler, the chair of the Slavic Department, said that she is concerned that “reshaping” might mean merging smaller departments, which would come at the cost of “closer relationships with students, smaller classes, a greater sense of cohesion among faculty, and shared intellectual projects.”
Sanskrit and Indian Studies Department chair Leonard W. J. van der Kuijp said that his department should be spared further cuts because it is “already bare bones,” with just one staff member and one tenured professor in the department itself. He said that about a decade ago a proposed merger between Sanskrit and East Asian Languages and Civilizations was rejected because there was “no intellectual rationale.” 
English professor Daniel G. Donoghue cautioned against a merger of English and Celtic because he believes that the Celtic department might disappear within English, though he said that mergers in the style of the Romance Languages and Literatures Department might be a workable alternative.
But other professors saw exciting opportunities in combining departments.
English professor Gordon Teskey said that while he does not have a grasp of administrative details, he believes that larger departments can be “intellectually enlivening” for faculty.
Former Dean  of the Faculty and Professor of China Studies William C. Kirby agreed. “This is the moment to think creatively about how historically independent departments may interact or merge with other academic units,” he said. “That could be a source of really powerful intellectual collaboration.”
English professor Louis Menand said that while the administration can only fire faculty members by closing departments, he has not heard it being discussed and does not believe that the administration needs to change its departmental structure.
He said that FAS administrators might instead decide not to replace retiring professors. “The only way to save money at the level they need to, is to not hire replacement faculty for faculty who leave,” he said. “One full-time senior faculty member costs a lot of money.”
Donoghue said he hopes that such a scenario does not play out.
“There is room for innovative changes in administration,” he said. “I don’t think Harvard is oversupplied in its faculty. I don’t think anyone is seriously talking about cutting the number of faculty.”
Besides the reshaping of the Faculty, humanities professors universally said they are worried about the budget of the University’s libraries.
Donoghue acknowledged that the library has a large budget, but said that because costs are increasing, book acquisition is suffering. “Harvard is called Harvard,” Donoghue said, “because John Harvard gave his library.”

University President Drew G. Faust publicly reaffirmed Harvard’s support for federal legislation that would allow illegal immigrant students to become permanent residents—a position shared by the Association of American Universities and all three representatives to the US congress whose districts include Harvard.“The DREAM Act would throw a lifeline to these students who are already working hard in our middle and high schools and living in our communities by granting them the temporary legal status that would allow them to pursue postsecondary education,” Faust wrote in letters to Senators Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 and John F. Kerry, and Representative Michael E. Capuano. “I believe it is in our best interest to educate all students to their full potential—it vastly improves their lives and grows our communities and economy.”Currently, undocumented immigrant children can only obtain permanent residency through their parents.The 2009 DREAM Act—or the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act—was first introduced in Congress in March with the support of senior Congressional Democratic leaders including Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, Russ Feingold, an Kennedy.The legislation would make illegal immigrant students who graduate from U.S. high schools eligible to apply for conditional permanent residency if they plan to attend a college or university or if they plan to enter the military. Students can then go on to apply for citizenship once they earn a college degree or serve for two years in the military.Similar legislation had been repeatedly proposed in both the Senate and the House since 2001, though it has never been brought to a floor vote as a stand-alone bill.When the most recent legislation was first introduced in March, several students in the College’s Act On a Dream club brought two undocumented Harvard students to Faust’s office hours—a opportunity extended to students only a few times a year—and asked her to publicly back their cause.A few months later, the student group organized a rally on May 1—international workers’ day—and amassed roughly 120 signatures in a petition to Faust.Harvard has a tendency to have this domino effect,” said Melissa Tran ’10, a member of the organization. “We really hoped that getting Drew Faust to publicly support the DREAM Act would encourage other university presidents to do so.”Faust’s stance on this issue is not unprecedented at Harvard, as the University has supported previous versions of the legislation, Harvard’s chief lobbyist Kevin Casey said.Now that the bill has been reintroduced under the Obama administration, Casey said that Faust thought it an “opportune” time to “reconnect” with members of Congress who were already in support of the legislation.But while students said they were hopeful that Faust’s gesture would help push the bill forward, Casey said that the timing of a possible vote was difficult to forecast, as “immigration issues are always difficult to gauge.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

Funding for undergraduate advising will face substantial reductions next fall.The concentration fair for freshmen and sophomores has been eliminated, and the “Advising Fortnight” programming will be serially reduced, downsizing from 72 events to 35, according to a document obtained by The Crimson on advising budget cuts.  In addition, the head of undergraduate advising programming, Associate Dean Monique Rinere, will leave this summer for a new post at Columbia, and her post will likely be left vacant, according to two students on the student advisory committee.The advising office faces the “loss of one assistant dean,” whose responsibilities would have included overseeing  new advising programs that would cater to athletes and international students, according to the document.  There is no indication from the document that a layoff will result from the elimination of the position.According to Omar M. Abdelsamad ’09, who is a student on the advising committee, most of the programming cuts were not essential.“All the advising events you go to have a lot of food, as a rule,” he said. “A lot of that will be gone.”There will also be reductions in lunch funding for freshman academic advisers, likely leading to reductions in “number of lunches people have with their advisees,” the document suggests. A year-old program for students to discuss research opportunities with faculty over lunch will also be slashed.The peer advising fellows program will go virtually untouched, and there is no indication that the $1000 stipend for advisors will be cut. Funds allocated for study breaks—$20 per semester for every advisee—also are not mentioned.  Last year, funding for PAF programming was cut by a third.Many PAFs have said that though their stipend is not being reduced, they would do the same work for free because the experience is so rewarding.“I take it more as a service than an obligation,” said Elizabeth C. Spira ’11, referring to her responsibilities as a PAF. “I would be wiling to take less money and still do the position.”Despite the grim projections on paper, some students on the committee did not believe that the cuts would be so drastic in reality. Abdelsamad said that he does not believe the concentration fair would be completely eliminated.  “That was a harsh assessment,” he said. He said that the fair will likely combine with another event, or take a more subdued form.According to Abdelsamad, the cuts were made with the goal of trying to impact advising as little as possible. “They’re removing things like food at events,” he said. “The core advising is still there.”Eric Newcomer contributed to the reporting for this article. —Staff writer Laura G.

Over 20 students gathered in front of the Holyoke Center Wednesday evening to protest Harvard University Health Services’ decision to discontinue anonymous HIV testing.Waving signs that read “My right to privacy includes my right to anonymity” and “I’m pro-testing,” the group of students from the College as well as several graduate schools assembled by Massachusetts Ave. after abandoning their plans to conduct a “test-in.” Protestors had originally planned to request HIV tests en masse in order to demonstrate the demand for anonymous testing. But a majority of protesters were turned away by UHS because they did not have an appointment or an actual medical ailment, according to Craig B. Colbeck, a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student.Linda Ellison, who teaches in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality department, organized the event after hearing about the policy change from UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 at a May 11 meeting. She said she hoped that the protest would make people aware of the importance of anonymous testing.“I hope that it’s raising awareness,” she said. “UHS is trying to make this a very undercover issue.”Jia Hui Lee ’12, a political chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, said that the decision to halt anonymous testing puts people at risk.“It fails to acknowledge the fact that there are individuals in the community who need this service,” he said. “We’re here to show UHS that there is this need and demand for anonymous HIV testing.”Medical School student Selena Jorgensen, who joined the protest after hearing about it in an e-mail, said that ending anonymous HIV testing would cause people to avoid being tested, a situation that she said would be unacceptable.“If even one person doesn’t get tested because there’s no anonymous testing, the system has failed,” she said.Rosenthal said in an interview yesterday that free anonymous HIV testing is still available in the Boston area. As for the protest, he said that he does not anticipate that it will have bearing on UHS policy because he hasn’t received formal complaints from the protestors.“I’ve never heard anything from students protesting this,” he said. “They’ve sent no comments directly to me.”But protestor Alethia Williams ’11 said that even if UHS does not change its policy, the protest would not be in vain.“It’s definitely worth the fight, if nothing else,” she said.—Staff writer Naveen N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In about six weeks, Jeffrey M. Young, the grey-haired and silver-tongued former Newton superintendent, will take the helm of Cambridge Public Schools.
Although his appointment as superintendent was met with controversy when the School Committee passed over Deputy Superintendent Carolyn L. Turk—a black woman and longtime leader in the district—for the position, Young will likely enjoy an early honeymoon, with even some of Turk’s backers expecting tremendous results from him.
“There are huge expectations for him to do great things,” said Alfred F. Fantini, the senior School Committee member and one of the two who voted for Turk. “People...really think some amazing things are going to happen.”
The high expectations for Young reflect his previous successes leading school districts in Newton, Lexington, and Lynnfield. But in Cambridge, the Harvard-trained educator with a passion for English literature will be confronted with challenges unlike those he has seen in his three decade career: how to educate an extraordinarily diverse student population while simultaneously navigating the politics of an urban school district.
A ROUNDABOUT PATH
Young, who has led Newton schools for over a decade, had not always intended to be an educator.
“First I wanted to be a rock star,” Young said. “And then I wanted to be a basketball player, but I wasn’t tall enough for that.”
Instead, the Brandeis English major hoped to pursue his passion for writing. But after a short-lived career that involved working as a ghostwriter, textbook contributor, and greeting card composer, Young decided that he “probably wasn’t going to make it” and decided to go back to school.
After completing a master’s degree from Tufts, Young began teaching English at Brookline High School, a period he recalls as the “the happiest days of my life.” After working on a curriculum assignment at a Brookline elementary and middle school, Young became drawn to the work he could do as a district administrator.  
“Even though I would be sacrificing some of the day-to-day relationships with a smaller number of people, there was the opportunity to have a broader influence on education throughout the community,” he said.
He earned a doctorate from the Harvard Graduate School of Education and joined the Lynnfield Public Schools in 1988, eventually serving as the district’s superintendent before moving on to Lexington and then Newton, the community he had lived in for over 30 years. The Newton district, the ninth largest in the state, serves approximately 11,500 students, or nearly twice as many as Cambridge.
Paul S. Stein, a Newton district administrator, said that although the city is considerably less diverse than Cambridge, Newton’s large size and various neighborhoods present “a unique set of demographics.” He added that the suburban community is actually far more socioeconomically diverse than is commonly thought. Approximately 30 percent of Newton students are minorities, versus 60 percent in Cambridge.
Young said that one of his most significant accomplishments in Newton was his effort to guarantee academic excellence in all of the schools across the city. The challenge, he said, was standardizing the district’s curriculum without inhibiting teachers’ creativity.
“It was a hard thing to do because it was a major change, and it was a major change that many teachers were uncomfortable with,” said Susan R. Heyman, a member of the Newton Public School Committee.
Heyman added that she thought Young handled the challenge well, saying that although Newton does have standardized curricula, it has not become “a school system that just [teaches] on the textbook.”
Geoff N. Epstein, another member of the Newton School Committee, said Young also had success in improving Newton’s special education programs.
“When he came in, special ed was just regular special ed, nothing special about it,” Epstein said. “He brought a lot of attention to that. He ensured that we didn’t just stick to the state mandate but went beyond it.”
But Epstein criticized Young for focusing too much on below-average students and not enough on high-achievers, emphasizing what he saw as the district’s neglect of math and science.
Young, who defended Newton’s math and science programs, pointed out that “the great challenge that Newton faces is a budgetary one”—one that, according to Epstein, Young will not face in Cambridge.
Cambridge spent $24,467 per student in the 2006-2007 school year, while Newton spent $14,524, according to the Massachusetts Department of Education.
THE PATH FORWARD
School Committee members said that while Young’s extensive experience in education is impressive, he will have his work cut out for him in Cambridge, both educationally and politically.
School Committee member Marc C. McGovern said that Cambridge faces a host of challenges, including an achievement gap documented in the district’s standardized test scores.
“For a district of our size and with our resources, why we continue to have a percentage of our district struggle is beyond me. We haven’t figured it out yet,” McGovern said. “There have been many superintendents who have come here, who haven’t been able to figure it out. Hopefully [Young] will have the answer.”
Although Cambridge does have significant financial resources, its “socioeconomic status is artificially heightened” by the presence of wealthy residents affiliated with local universities and other industries, said Robert S. Peterkin, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former superintendent of Cambridge Public Schools.
Peterkin, who has worked with Young in the past, added that the disparity in wealth—which is generally wider in Cambridge than it is in Newton—contributes to the district’s achievement gap.
“I think the thing that Jeff will find different is the diversity of Cambridge Public Schools,” Peterkin said. “What he’ll find is more diversity of student body, of community, and of programs that he will need to learn quickly and evaluate.”
Young said that his decision to come to Cambridge was based on a strong desire to work in an urban district, something he called “a professional challenge.”
“Urban school districts are really the great area of challenge and opportunity in the state and the country right now,” Young said.
But Fantini said Young’s lack of experience with urban schools was a potential concern.
“This is going to be a real challenge, and how he navigates that is really going to be the test,” he said. “That’s the biggest unanswered question right now.”
The other test for Young, Fantini added, will be his ability to please the district’s often fractious constituencies.
“We have a lot of interest groups in Cambridge,” Fantini said.
But McGovern said he thought Young would be a good fit because “he wants to be here.” Young will be taking a $30,000 pay cut to come to Cambridge.
“I think he is someone who philosophically and educationally is very much in line with the values that we hold here in Cambridge,” he said. 

OUTLINING AN AGENDA
Most School Committee members said they expect that Young’s first priority will be improving the district’s middle school education.
The committee formed a commission in 2007 to formally study Cambridge’s sixth through eighth grades, especially the problems of small peer groups, limited opportunities for faculty collaboration, and a shortage of subject-specific teachers in some schools. 
The committee passed a motion this year stipulating that the new superintendent present a set of recommendations on the issue within the first 100 days of his term.
“We’re eager to have a conversation and implement something regarding the middle schools. That’s one of the first things we’re going to hand over to him,” Fantini said. “That may be the first major critical decision he makes.”
School Committee members also said they hope Young will work to improve special education, as well as address the debate over controlled choice, the district’s method of placing students that attempts to establish socioeconomic diversity in all schools.
But Young said that he plans to become better acquainted with Cambridge before making any concrete suggestions. To prepare for his upcoming transition into Cambridge, Young has visited schools, attended city events, and spoken with a number of community and district leaders—including nearly all the members of the School Committee in individual meetings.
“I think it’s a terrible mistake for a superintendent to come into a job and expect to change a whole system according to his or her own preferences,” he said. “The right approach is to take some time to learn about the culture of the schools and the community. It’s not about tearing things down and creating something brand new.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One by one, they exit Science Center C Lecture Hall. It’s lunchtime on the first day of final exams, and they are relieved for the welcome break in testing.
No, these are not exhausted students. The departing individuals—with their brief cases, lunch bags, and name tags—have just finished counting hundreds of exam booklets, carefully matching each one to names printed on an attendance sheet, checking the spelling of each to make sure that all were accounted for.
These exam proctors perform their duties with care. And this morning, some do them with a hint of nostalgia, as they’ve just been told it will be their last exam season.
“I’m sad that they’re ending the program. It’s not because of the money, it’s just that I won’t be able to see a lot of these people again and I won’t be able to be around students,” said Robert “Bob” Leathe, one of the exam proctors filing out of Lecture Hall C.
Leathe, a retired federal worker, has been proctoring exams at Harvard for over a decade. “The best part is just seeing the students and being able to help them—not just in taking them exams, but also if they get sick and have to go to the infirmary,” Leathe said. 
END OF AN ERA
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office announced last week that they would eliminate hiring temporary examination proctors beginning fall 2009 in order to trim budgets as part of $77 million in cuts made across FAS. Instead, “existing faculty, graduate students, and staff will proctor exams,” according to a May 11 announcement on the FAS planning Web site.
“The registrar [aerry S. Kane] looked at the expense associated with hiring people to proctor exams and he found that he could achieve some savings by asking professors to proctor their own exams while not making a serious impact on student’s experience,” said Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Registrar Barry S. Kane did not return request for comment on how much was saved by the change. But according to Leslie Oliver, a retired teacher from Cambridge Ridge and Latin and a sixth-year exam proctor, the head proctors receive $12 an hour, and the assistant proctors are paid $10.
Most students interviewed said that this part of the budget cut will not have a significant impact on their academic lives.
“It seems irrelevant to me,” said Yvonne A. Yang ’11. “I’m not too concerned about it, because students will perform the same on exams regardless.”
James W. Danz ’12 said that exam proctors are notorious among students for being clueless retirees. “Honestly, from a student’s perspective, those jobs have always seemed pretty unnecessary, because the proctors never seem to know what’s going on,” said Danz. “Eliminating exam proctors seems to be one of the most logical cuts, in my opinion.” 
STANDARDIZED TESTING
The exam proctors, who are trained annually before the final exams begin, say they believe the elimination of the proctors will threaten the uniform nature of the test-taking experience.
“I think there’s something to be said about the standardization. There’s same testing conditions everywhere, A student can go into a test knowing what it will be like,” Oliver said, “I’m not sure if there will be the same sort of standardization next year.”
The cutback has already had an effect. Pam Moffat, who has proctored exams at Harvard for the past five years, said she had always attended a three-hour training session at the beginning of each exam week. But this time, proctors said, Harvard did not offer returning Proctors training.
Instead, according to first-time proctor Lynn R. Gettman, new proctors were introduced to the process in an hour-long session and given informational pamphlets.
Biology Professor Charles Marshall said he welcomes the end of rigid testing rules that have, on occasion, obstructed his goals to educate.
Marshall said that during one exam, he had wanted to mark the exam of a student who had left 45 minutes into the test, but was prohibited due to rules that the exam cannot be touched by anybody while testing was in progress.
“I was told that I shall not touch the exam. A little bit like Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings—‘You shall not pass!’” Marshall said.
Professor and former Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby said he welcomed the elimination of exam proctors as it did away with a physical manifestation of Harvard’s emphasis on exams.
“Harvard can often overemphasize the final exams as part of the evaluation of students’ work,” Kirby said. “I simply believe that there’s no need to stand guard over our students. I don’t know of any other place that has paid proctors for final examinations.”
NO MORE NEXT YEARS
For the exam proctors who will no longer return to Harvard’s campus for exam periods, the cut marks an unfortunate end to a gratifying experience. Many proctors are former schoolteachers and nurses, and they said they have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in their retirement.
“I enjoy working with students,” said Moffat, who has administered exams for five years, “I also volunteer with the local school system. When you’re retired, it’s nice to have something you enjoy.”
“And it makes us feel younger!” said Joan Danieli, who has been an exam proctor of 10 years.
According to Danieli, the camaraderie between proctors contribute significantly to her job satisfaction. “These people have become very dear friends. People who’ve been here a long time feel especially emotional about not getting to come back. We always used to say, ‘See you next winter!’ or ‘See you next spring!’ and now we won’t have that.”

MEDFORD, Mass.—Jabrai J. Copney, a 20-year-old New York resident, pled not guilty to charges of first-degree murder for a Monday shooting in Kirkland J-entryway that led to the death of 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby early the next morning.
Copney, a New York songwriter, turned himself in to the Cambridge Police Thursday evening, according to the District Attorney’s office of Middlesex County. He pled not guilty during his arraignment Friday morning in Cambridge District Court in Medford, Mass., where a judge ruled he would be held without bail until his July 15 hearing.
District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. '85 announced Friday morning that two female Harvard students are linked to the incident and allowed those involved to gain entry to Kirkland House. Leone declined to comment on what if any charges might be pressed against the two Harvard students, whose identities were not disclosed. But one of the two Harvard students tied to the incident has been asked to leave campus and will not be allowed to graduate in June, the Boston Globe reported on Saturday. “This is a highly educated, independent young woman who has literally been cared for since she was a teenager by Harvard—and now they have terminated her right to be on campus,” Jeffrey T. Karp, the woman’s lawyer, told the Globe. “There is no justification for it. She may have known the people involved, but you know, it’s not guilt by association in this country.”Karp declined to identify his client, who is a Kirkland resident from Brooklyn.Karp and Harvard officials did not return requests for comment from The Crimson Saturday. Copney, along with two male individuals from New York, allegedly confronted Cosby in the basement of Kirkland J-entryway Monday afternoon. Three shots were fired, and one struck Cosby in the abdomen. The DA’s office has yet to say whether Copney or one of his cohorts pulled the trigger.
After the incident, Copney and the two individuals accompanying him allegedly fled the scene and headed toward Lowell House, where they met an unidentified witness, according to Assistant District Attorney Daniel Bennett. Copney then told the witness, "there was a fight, and then a shooting," Bennett said.
Soon after, Copney allegedly took a cab to South Station with the two individuals and left the city for New York.
Around the same time, Cosby stumbled down Dunster Street, where he was found by witnesses and eventually collapsed on the sidewalk asking for water.
Police later recovered a weapon that matched a description given by one witness of the weapon allegedly carried by Copney as he left Kirkland that day, said Bennett.
Copney had been in contact with Cosby several times leading up to the incident on Monday to set up a meeting in Kirkland J-entryway, Bennett said at the arraignment, though he gave no more information about the extent of their relationship.
Officials said this morning that they did not know whether Copney was dealing drugs on campus; his connection to Harvard appears to stem from his relationship with a long-time girlfriend—a Harvard senior he has visited frequently over the past two years, said Copney’s defense attorney J. W. Carney.
In a press conference earlier Friday morning, Leone, the district attorney, said that a pound of marijuana and approximately $1,000 was found on or near Cosby after he had been shot. He added that Copney had planned to scam Cosby for the drugs and money. On Wednesday evening, The Crimson reported that Cosby has been linked to drug sales to Harvard students.
Cosby’s family and friends attended Friday’s arraignment hearing, during which some of them left in tears.
Between Monday and the time of his arrest, Copney reportedly left for New York and returned to Cambridge only to leave again, telling an unidentified witness that he was going to leave for South Carolina, where his family lives, Bennett said.
But upon hearing of the status of the investigation from friends, Copney contacted an attorney and learned that he would likely be charged with first-degree murder and be held without bail.
Understanding the charges he would face, Copney then surrendered to Cambridge Police Thursday evening.
Copney, whose father is a retired New York police officer and whose mother worked for the City of New York, graduated from a performing arts high school in the city. At 15, he wrote "Feelin’ It," a song performed by the R&B/pop group New Edition.
In brief remarks to the court, Carney, the defendant’s attorney, sought to humanize his client, detailing his personal aspirations and his family background.
"When I say he is a professional songwriter it is both a dream and a reality for this man," Carney said.
Though the two individuals with Copney at the time of the shooting have yet to be apprehended, Leone, the DA, stated Friday morning that he does not believe there to be a safety risk at Harvard.
