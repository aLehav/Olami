After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Look, Becina, this room has two closets: one for your clothes, and one for you!”
One of my friends told me this a few weeks ago as we toured upperclassmen dorms. I couldn’t stop laughing for the rest of the tour. Nothing beats a good closet joke.
Later, I was relaying this joke to one of my queer friends, who laughed and then asked in all seriousness, “But, do you actually consider yourself to be closeted?”
Well, yes and no.
Being partially closeted is a huge part of my identity. It affects how I think about myself, what I share about myself, and my relationships with other people.
People tend to view the closet as a temporary state that every queer person should want to get out of, where the end goal is to come out to the world. And in a way, I see where that line of thinking began—plenty of people do feel trapped in the closet, desperate to escape. But we need to recognize that escape isn’t always the best or safest option for each individual. We celebrate people who found the courage to come out, but forget about the equally courageous people who found ways to embrace their queer identities without coming out to everyone. Consequently, we ignore the very valid reasons people have for not coming out, such as personal safety or privacy.
For me, there are two main categories of people who I’m not out to. The first is those whom I’ve made an active decision to not come out to due to concerns for my personal well-being and safety. These are people in my life who are so unaccepting that I might never come out to them in order to preserve my own comfort and happiness. It comes down to this: I have a finite amount of time and energy, and I’d rather spend it on spreading love and seeking fulfillment over trying to crack open a tightly jammed closet door. Of course, that’s not ideal, and I will spend the rest of my life fighting anti-queer sentiment in our society in the hopes that the next generation doesn’t face the same intolerance. But, I can do all that without coming out to every single person in my life; remaining partially closeted and advocating for equality are not mutually exclusive.
And then the second category is the people who I’m just incidentally not out to, which spans classmates, professors, and random strangers I pass on the street. I haven’t actively decided to not tell them; there are just a variety of factors influencing why it hasn’t come up. First off, I don’t feel like I need to come out, so I tend to not force the conversation. The idea that I have to intentionally come out to the world reinforces the assumption that other people are entitled to know details about my private life.
Some people choose to be very vocal about their queerness, and that’s a wonderful way to increase representation and raise awareness for BGLTQ issues. But no one should feel obligated to do that. I tend to speak more openly about being queer on online platforms (such as this column) or in queer-specific spaces, but I’m wary of randomly bringing it up in most conversations, mostly due to my complete ineptitude in coming out smoothly and effortlessly.
The truth is, coming out is one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever done. It’s more uncomfortable than the time I tripped and nearly fell onstage during graduation, the time I accidentally called my teacher “Mr. Right,” and even the time I went snowboarding in a strapless bra which kept slipping down to my waist. I’d rather do all of those things in the same day than come out to anyone ever again. I’ve come out dozens of times, and yet, each time, it catches me off guard. Something about being explicitly queer, I mean clear, about a topic I tend to dance around is incredibly off-putting.
I’ve tried just blurting out, “I’m queer,” but that feels highly inorganic and forced. Alternatively, I’ve tried dropping hints that I like girls, but it takes a lot of mental energy to set up a conversation where I can bring up my attraction to the same gender in a seemingly natural way. Plus, this method usually leads people to think I’m a lesbian, which may or may not actually be true.
Because of these difficulties, I usually opt to just not come out to someone unless it either comes up naturally or there’s a specific reason they need to know. However, my nondisclosure can lead a lot of people to assume that I’m straight.
At the very beginning of the school year, some of my new friends (who are straight girls) were talking about hook-ups, and somehow everyone started sharing whether they planned on hooking up with any guys. When I was the only one left who hadn’t said anything, all eyes turned to me. “Well, Becina, what about you?” I froze. I don’t quite remember when I did next, but I’m sure it was some combination of incoherent mumbling and avoiding eye contact.
I came out to all of them a week later.
In hindsight, I did feel a bit of pressure to come out to them, if only to avoid any potential repeats of the same awkwardness. I also ran the slight risk that one of them would be homophobic or treat me differently after I came out. But, I weighed the pros and cons and then made a choice that was right for me.
Perhaps other queer people would have reacted differently in my shoes—some may have used the question about the hookup as an opportunity to come out, others may not have come out at all, while others may have avoided the situation entirely by coming out much earlier in the friendship. And that’s perfectly okay. Coming out is very personal and means different things to different people. We should be mindful of other people’s experiences and not place value judgments on their decisions because, ultimately, it is up to each individual to determine if, how, why, and when they want to come out. I am partially closeted, but I have my hand on that door knob, wielding the power to open and close the closet door as I see fit. And no one can take that power away from me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, the Undergraduate Council announced that the Harvard University ID cards of the incoming Class of 2021 will also serve as Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Charlie Cards. This move comes after a 100-student pilot program carried out by the Harvard Office for Sustainability and Harvard Transportation and Parking over two years ago.
Though the program for the Class of 2021 technically remains a pilot, we are heartened that the UC is giving impetus to the modernization of HUIDs, which will indisputably be a boon to incoming classes. We often criticize the UC leadership for their quixotic campaign promises or occasional pursuit of initiatives that were more or less moribund from the beginning. The UC’s persistence in implementing this measure, however, illustrates that student government has the institutional robustness and maturity to make good on at least some of its long-term promises.
Moreover, this program will bring numerous benefits to the incoming Class of 2021. It can occasionally be difficult to find Charlie Cards in the T station, and, of course, it’s nice to have one fewer card in one’s wallet. Some students may not even know that Charlie Cards exist, which may cause them to incur surcharges when they are purchasing tickets for public transportation. No matter their circumstance, they will be better able to navigate an occasionally overwhelming public transportation system.
The benefits of the improved HUIDs, however, will go beyond convenience. The fact that the entire freshman class will have a T pass with them at all times may incentivize them to use the T more frequently. The Harvard Office for Sustainability’s involvement reflects the more environmentally friendly nature of public transit. Additionally, we hope students will be eager to use the new technology, especially when they arrive on campus, so it’s possible they will better acquaint themselves with the Greater Boston metro, and hence not become entrapped by the Harvard bubble throughout their four years at the College.
We’re glad the University is taking steps—even small ones—to make students’ lives more convenient. Even if the benefits are relatively minor, we encourage the exploration of other improvements that could make HUIDs more versatile. Allowing HUIDs to also serve as Charlie Cards is a welcome change. At worst, it will simply save future classes the expense of purchasing a Charlie Card; at best, it will encourage Harvard students to better explore the great cities of Cambridge and Boston. We hope the UC continues to make decisions that aid students with even seemingly simple issues like transportation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2015, George Will wrote, “were the lungs the seat of wisdom, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly would be wise, but they are not and he is not.” This week O’Reilly was fired by Fox News, after an internal investigation documented an extended and highly credible history of sexual assault allegations against Mr. O’Reilly. The end of “The O’Reilly Factor” ultimately proves that sheer lungpower is an insufficient remedy for years of vicious and predatory abuse. Because O’Reilly was the dominant figure in American news media for more than a decade, the public will have to come to terms with the legacy of the “No Spin Zone.” But this sort of soul searching is particularly vital here in Cambridge, because like it or not, William James O’Reilly Jr. is a Harvard man.
Harvard produced the person who actually said Morehouse Professor Marc Lamont Hill “looks like a Cocaine dealer.” Who infamously argued that it is impossible to scientifically explain oceanic tides. Who casually explained that black Congresswoman Maxine Waters’ “James Brown wig” is ample reason to ignore her political opinions. For O’Reilly, the ACLU were “terrorists,” same-sex marriages were indistinguishable from bestiality, and homeless people were “criminals” busy “urinating and defecating in the streets.” In 2014, O’Reilly ventured that “there has to be some downside to having a woman president, something that may not fit with that office.” In 2007, he said the female mayor of Virginia Beach should be “at home baking pies.” At times, viewing “The O’Reilly Factor” was difficult. Most decent people would be uneasy watching Mr. O’Reilly scream at the son of a 9/11 victim, or call George Will a “hack,” all on national television. The list goes on.
Very few people live their entire lives without saying something they regret. Good people often say deeply evil things. In 2008, Barack Obama hatefully and memorably attacked rural Americans, claiming they “cling to guns and religion.” There is, however, an obvious distinction between an isolated remark followed by a prompt apology, and a protracted and vicious campaign of mean-spirited, dishonest, and malicious commentary. Mr. O’Reilly fell on the wrong side of that divide.
Of course, none of the above misbehavior really had anything to do with Mr. O’Reilly’s departure. Rather, it was O’Reilly’s cowardly and abusive posture toward female colleagues which eventually forced the network’s hand. In a 2004 sexual harassment lawsuit, a woman claimed O’Reilly “told her to buy a vibrator, called her at times when it sounded as if he was masturbating and described sexual fantasies involving her.” The woman further claims O’Reilly said he would make her “pay so dearly that she’ll wish she’d never been born.” The suit was eventually settled for $9 million.
O’Reilly would frequently mention that he “went to Harvard” as a kind of tasteless offhand boast. The man was nothing if not disingenuous, so it is no surprise that O’Reilly holds no undergraduate letters from Harvard but rather attended a two-year program at the Kennedy School. After the 2008 financial crisis, Jay Light, then the Dean of Harvard Business School, declared it “a time of great introspection for this institution.” The Business School took time to consider how HBS graduates could act so recklessly in global markets. In the same sense, the Kennedy School and Harvard community at large should reflect on how this university produced such a fundamentally indecent human being.
On the September 9, 2007 episode of his radio show, Bill O’Reilly described a visit to Sylvia’s, a famous black restaurant in Harlem. Specifically, O’Reilly described his utter shock at the respectful, clean, kind, and joyous experience he had at Sylvia’s. The total surprise is amusing if predictable: “I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it’s run by blacks.” Nothing is more surprising to a racist than black excellence. Nothing flusters a homophobe more than gay love. And this is the ultimate core of the matter. Things like kindness, love, happiness, diversity, and respect challenge the worldviews of people like Bill O’Reilly. Harvard can, should, and in many cases, does promote all of those things. Reflecting on the legacy of O’Reilly and his “Factor,” the University should look to present a compelling counterexample to the forces of hate and cruelty in the universe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donning denim shirts and jeans, dozens of students flooded the Science Center Tuesday in a demonstration against sexual assault.
The Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response organized  #HarvardWearsDenim, which was a part of Peace Over Violence’s International Denim Day. The event came at the tail end of sexual assault awareness month, a month-long series of events that also included a launch party for Sexual Literacy, an online sex, relationship, and consent advice column.
“Survivors deserve dignity, respect, and justice, and we’re going to work together to do better,” CARE member Julia B. Wiener ’19 said.
International Denim Day is an annual event created in response a 1998 Italian Supreme Court decision to overturn a rape conviction on the grounds that the woman was wearing tight jeans when she was assaulted. The next day, women working in the Italian Parliament wore jeans to show support for the victim, according to the Denim Day website.
Event volunteers stood in the lobby of the Science Center handing out stickers, condoms, flyers, and candy. Later in the day, volunteers held a raffle to win sex toys, a J.P. Licks giftcard, and a giftcard to Garment District. Students also wrote notes of support and encouragement about sexual assault prevention and took photos with their statements in a photo booth.
“Everyone can come and take a picture with their solidarity statement and be really vocal about how they support survivors,” Wiener said.
This year was Harvard’s third time participating in International Denim Day. According to #HarvardWearsDenim Facebook event page, in the event’s first year in 2015, 3,000 people participated and 55 student groups pledged their support of working against sexual assault. The following year, 6,000 students participated and over 100 student groups pledged. This year, 150 groups pledged their support, Rosenbaum said.
“It’s important that people come to show solidarity,” CARE member Arianna R. Kahn ’18 said.
Weiner said she hopes that people will continue showing support even after Denim Day and sexual assault prevention month are over.
“Sexual assault isn’t just an issue during sexual assault month,” she said.

Raj Panjabi, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, will use the $1 million he won in the 2017 TED Prize to train healthcare workers around the world, he announced Tuesday night at the international TED conference in Vancouver, Canada.
Panjabi, who fled his home country of Liberia at age nine due to civil war and became a doctor in the United States, returned to Liberia in 2005. At the time, only 51 doctors were available to serve the four million people in the war-torn country, a situation analogous to eight doctors serving the entirety of Washington, D.C.
So Panjabi and his team founded Last Mile Health, a nonprofit which trains and hires individuals in geographically isolated areas with the skills to provide basic, life-saving healthcare services to their communities.
In his remarks in Vancouver Tuesday night, Panjabi said the organization he plans to found with the prize money, Community Health Academy, will train healthcare workers around the world and save 30 million lives by 2030.
“The idea is that help for these communities might not come from places we expect,” he said to reporters on Tuesday night. “It may not come from the outside — it may actually come from within.”
According to its website, the TED Prize is awarded annually to a leader “with a creative, bold wish to spark global change.” Since 2013, $1 million have been allotted to each of the winners, who unveil their plans at the TED conference. Past honorees include former President Bill Clinton, singer-philanthropist Bono, and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.
In 2009, Last Mile Health provided the first rural, public HIV program in Liberia. During the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, the organization worked with the Liberian government to train more than 1,300 healthcare workers how to prevent the spread of the deadly viral epidemic.
In 2016, Punjabi was selected to TIME Magazine’s list of Top 100 Most Influential People, with a tribute written by former President Bill Clinton.
“To spend time with Raj Panjabi is to see up close what happens when someone with uncommon courage and compassion puts himself on the front lines of the world’s most complex challenges,” Clinton wrote at the time.

A pamphlet providing information about transgender rights distributed by the College’s Office for BGLTQ Student Life drew attention and criticism from various conservative and Christian websites over the past week.
Students and BGLTQ Office staffers first circulated copies of the pamphlet when an anti-transgender ‘free speech’ bus visited campus on March 30, according to BGLTQ Office Director Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07.
The two-page pamphlet, titled “Get the facts about gender diversity. Fight transphobia,” gives information on issues surrounding gender identity and lists local and Harvard-specific resources for transgender individuals, including the BGLTQ Office.
“The idea was to provide a counter-message to the one that was being promoted by the bus,” Scarborough wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday. “My office set up a table outside of the Science Center [and] people who chose to could approach the table, talk with us, and take a flyer.”
In particular, the document asserts that sex as assigned at birth does not determine gender identity, that “there are more than two sexes,” and that “misinformation” targeting transgender individuals amounts to “a form of systemic violence.”
“Fixed binaries and biological essentialism, manifest in gendered language, misgendering someone, and the policing of trans bodies, threaten the lives of trans people,” the pamphlet reads.
Since the pamphlet’s dissemination, at least a dozen conservative and Christian media outlets have published articles commenting on the brochure. Several sites compared the document to a 2015 “Holiday Placemat for Social Justice” which advised Harvard students how to discuss issues related to race and diversity with family members over the holidays.
That placemat, distributed by the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, drew both praise and criticism, eventually prompting administrators to apologize for its creation and distribution.
Several conservative outlets wrote that they took issue with information contained in the pamphlet.
“At Harvard University, students are being taught that gender identity can change from day-to-day,” Evan Lips wrote for the New Boston Post, an online news source which bills itself as a “hub of conservative thought.” Lips asked: “How can there be more than just male and female?”
Scarborough wrote Wednesday that he believes the brochure helps advance the BGLTQ Office’s goal of preventing discrimination on campus.
“Part of the mission of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life is to educate and engage the Harvard community about the multiplicity of sexual and gender identities,” Scarborough wrote. “The flyer was very much in keeping with our office’s stated mission and was a sign of our support for the trans and gender non-conforming community at Harvard College.”
Students and BGLTQ Office staffers distributed the pamphlet a second time during an anti-transgender speech given by psychology professor Jordan B. Peterson on April 11, according to Scarborough. Peterson, who has faced criticism for his belief that gender and sex are not independent, spoke in the Science Center at an event hosted by the Open Campus Initiative, a new student group that has vowed to "test" free speech values on Harvard’s campus.
Lily M. Velona ’18, a member of the student-run Trans Task Force who helped circulate the pamphlet, wrote in a statement that they remember handing out fliers and dancing during Peterson’s speech. Velona was unaware of the online backlash to the pamphlet and wrote that  critics like Peterson do not make a legitimate argument.
“It isn’t a political debate,” Velona wrote. “This is a community of people facing incredible violence on this campus and beyond whose existence is being put up for debate in the same tradition of debating whether people of color or women or gay people are people.”

The Office of Student Life may soon begin evaluating existing student groups for similarities with other groups, an extension of existing efforts to combat redundancy in new student groups.
Last week, the Undergraduate Council adopted new standards for approving new student groups, requiring that future student groups avoid “clear similarities with other student organizations.” In the future, the OSL may begin evaluating student groups with  similar functions.
“I do know for a fact that they’re thinking about trying to align some of the standards of these audits a little bit more with the standards that we are now going to have with new student organizations,” Bonsall said.
If the OSL does take such a step, it will face a sprawling ecosystem of more than 400 student groups on campus, some of which may appear to be similar in scope and purpose.
Harvard Model Congress currently has 6 organizations registered with the OSL, meaning each group is eligible for individual funding. There are four student groups dedicated to Model United Nations and at least 14 a cappella groups on campus.
Both the Harvard College in Asia Program and the Harvard Program Asian International Relations send student groups on trips to various Asian countries every year. Both the Harvard Financial Analysts Club and the Veritas Financial Group offer its members education about the financial industry.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller, who could not be reached for comment for this story, previously told Undergraduate Council members that the Office of Student Life will audit student groups every five years. UC Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said the OSL’s audit included looking at whether student organizations updated their governing documents and included active members. In the future, these audits could begin evaluating groups for their similarities with other ones.
Student groups that appear to be very similar in name and stated purpose can still differ. For example,  the Debating Union and Debate Council practice different forms of debate, according to Lev B. Asimow ’18, Captain of the Debate Council, though the two could overlap.
“Policy debates are the one that the Debate Council primarily focuses on, although our organizational constitution reserves us the right to time to time compete in...other formats,” he said.
Debating Union President Daniel A. DeBois said while different debate clubs specialize in different formats, the Debating Union occasionally collaborates with the Debate Council on events.
“The one thing we do is they host the big high school tournament that Harvard hosts in February and we help with that, so we do have some coordination,” he said.
However, he said the two groups “would never merge organizations.”
Despite the new regulations, Bonsall said he does not see the new policy as cracking down on new student organizations. Bonsall said that some new student groups may be approved even if they do bear some similarities to existing ones.
“If that new branch or new chapter...is sufficiently distinguishable and is serving a different purpose or different group of students or a different specific interest area, then I wouldn't see any reason why we would on those grounds alone deny them the right to become a new student organization,” he said.
“I think that we’re going to err on the side of not preventing people from forming organizations,” Bonsall added.

Two economists debated the causes and potential solutions for the increase in American male unemployment at an Institute of Politics event Wednesday evening moderated by former University President Lawrence H. Summers.
Economists Nicholas Eberstadt ’76, the author of the book “Men Without Work: America’s Invisible Crisis” and Jason Furman ’92, a Senior Fellow a the Peterson Institute for International Economics, headlined the event Though the two agreed that male unemployment had in fact increased in recent years, they held opposing views on the trend’s relative importance as well as potential ways to address it.
The economists agreed that the unemployment rate can be a misleading metric because it doesn’t account for people who don’t work or aren’t looking for work. Calling male unemployment America’s hidden crisis, Eberstadt called for a greater degree of entrepreneurship in America to increase employment. Furman challenged some of the assertions made by Eberstadt.
“It is less obviously a problem when people say that they don’t want to work and they don’t. So why do we regard this as being such a crisis?” Furman, a former Obama administration staffer who served under Summers in the White House National Economic Council, said.
Eberstadt, who worked at the American Enterprise Institute, argued that heightened male unemployment constituted a waste of human capital.
“The forces in underutilization of human potential, I think it is a kind of humanitarian crisis. I also think it is a kind of moral crisis for the United States because of such a large share of the prospective male population entirely out of the economy,” Eberstadt said.
Speaking about the increase in the employment of women with children since the 1960’s, Summers offered an explanation as to why the forum focused on male, rather than female, unemployment.
“In terms of how well our society is functioning and our economy is functioning, preparing jobs and providing jobs for people who wanted and needed them, perhaps there is an equal problem among women as among men and it’s just been made invisible by this other trend,” Summers said.
Christopher M. Rudnicki, a Kennedy School student, said the forum was a balanced perspective on an issue that he saw as a key point in the 2016 election. Rudnicki said he thinks globalization is only one of many reasons behind labor force participation trends.
“So you look at changes in technology over time, which has a similar effect on labor markets, you look at cultural changes, in reference to changing family dynamics and women entering the workforce,” Rudnicki said. “One of the takeaways, is that it’s  hard to look at any one those and say this is the thing that has really led to men without work. I think it is a good, balanced perspective in light of a conversation that tends to be focused on the singular issue of trade a globalization.”

Harvard affiliates crowded into the Institute of Politics to listen to Ohio Governor John R. Kasich discuss his 2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and the rising polarization in American politics Wednesday night.
Kasich, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 and 2016, has held the offices of state senator, Congressman, and most recently Governor of Ohio.  Introducing Kasich, IOP fellow Christopher H. Shays called him “the Tom Brady of politics.”
“Tom Brady made everyone on his team be better than they thought they could be, and that’s what John Kasich does,” Shays, who worked with Kasich in Congress, said.
He highlighted points in his career that he was especially proud of, focusing on his years in Congress and his role in balancing the budget during the Clinton administration.
“I quit after we got the budget balanced, I said I’ve had enough—I’m leaving,” Kasich said.
The conversation quickly shifted to the direction of contemporary American politics. Kasich highlighted what he sees as the fundamental difficulties of US politics.
“Here’s the thing that troubles me about American politics, and I think it’s always been true: If you’re poor, if you’re weak, if you’re young, you don’t count,” Kasich said, “I think you listen, and then you do what you think you need to do. That’s what I think leadership is... Leadership means you walk a lonely road, and if people want to yell at you, well that’s life.”
Kasich noted that the 2016 election hinged on intense feelings in the electorate and criticized the way that his opponents talked about solutions to job loss, especially in the coal industry.
“You can’t take a coal miner and just say ‘tough’ or say ‘by the way I’m going to make America great again, we’re going to reopen all the mines and it’s going to be great,’ it’s not going to happen,” he said.
Kasich also said he was skeptical about the state of party politics, citing recent debates over the Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts.
“You know why they don’t want to pay for this? Because they don’t want to make any choices!.. In both parties, they think the only way to get up is to go along. I don’t think there’s any way they can say ‘okay we’re gonna cut all these taxes and it’s going to pay for itself,’” he said.
Kasich also shared career advice with students, complaining about two young people he said had taken an exorbitant amount of time to send him their resumes.
“For the millennials, man, get at it. Don’t be going slow and taking your time. When you have an opportunity seize it,” he said.

The deadline to make your college choice is drawing near, dear prefrosh. Around 60 percent of cross-admits make the right choice, but we’re here to convince pre-frosh to go Crimson just in case the future 40 percent makes the biggest mistake of their lives. Here are all the reasons why you should ditch the trees and party with us this fall instead. After all, while Stanford may be the “Harvard of the West Coast,” we are still the Harvard of everything.
Stanford students hate it
First of all, even Stanford students themselves love to rant about their school’s many shortcomings. Several years ago, a Stanford Daily writer created a Google Doc where over a hundred students complained about everything from the residential life to lack of diversity and good food. Wow, Stanford kids are actually doing our work for us here.
Stanford who?
Founded a whopping 250 years after Harvard, Stanford is a still mere plebe. We’ve got seven (!) United States President alumni. How many does Stanford have? One—and Hoover is surely no JFK or Obama. Furthermore, when is the last time you’ve seen a Stanford reference on TV? Exactly.
Ain’t got no cash
The community college of Palo Alto lacks not only the prestige and fame of the oldest university in the US but also our funds. With the biggest university endowment in the world, Harvard offers 11 percent more financial aid to 9 percent more students, compared to Stanford. We ain’t sayin you’re a Gold Digger but you shouldn’t mess with no broke colleges unless you like student debt.
Middle of nowhere
With the closest major city a whole hour away and virtually no businesses (or human life for that matter) around campus, Stanford is literally located in a big dusty farm. If you come to Harvard though, the T will whisk you away to the center of Boston in less than 20 minutes. Bonus points: a lit weekend in NYC is a mere 3 hours away!
Inferior social life
Maybe the lack of late night eateries and tiny dorms are to blame for the absolute lack of any resemblance of a party culture, but Stanford’s social scene is dryer (in both senses) than the jokes of a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. You will also be asked to leave the school if you are caught with any alcohol...
Stanford students kind of suck
No shade (but totally shade), the quality of the student body is seriously lacking. To put it simply, Stanford students cheat a lot and an admissions officer once said. "We could have thrown out all the students we accepted, and chosen a new class from the ones rejected, and we would have a stronger class." Can Stanford students even catch a break at this point?
