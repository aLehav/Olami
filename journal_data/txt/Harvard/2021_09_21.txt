New York-based “postcolonial” fashion label Head of State showcased its Spring/Summer 2022 Ready-To-Wear collection on Sept. 10 at The Kitchen on New York Fashion Week Day 4. Titled “Homecoming,” the collection consisted of 25 looks, including Head of State’s womenswear debut. According to his thoughtful show notes, Head of State’s designer, Taofeek Abijako, drew inspiration from the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC ‘77). The looks were “a modern interpretation of the guests and performers who attended FESTAC ‘77,” he wrote.
Anchored by a dancer whose performance had clear contemporary and West African influences, the show developed a connection between late ‘70s silhouettes and West African street and workwear. Abijako’s eye for tailoring is most evident in his reimagining of the ‘70s flared trousers with contrast lining exposed by cutouts. When paired with a shoulder-padded blazer in bright crimson, the designs projected nobility and elegance onto the onlooker. Exaggerated collars framed the angular visage of the models who evidently symbolized the arts and culture festival’s many guests: They held a bundle of bags, the only accessories presented in the collection save for a few cloth headwraps.
The setting was intimate. Abjiako explored his family’s history in front of a limited audience, which included his father and two younger brothers, in a small theatre. The models presented the garments around a raised center stage for the singular dancer. After the initial presentation of a majority of the collection, the show transitioned to an iterated unveiling of looks from behind the curtains on the center stage. Through suspension of disbelief, one could imagine that the final models were conjured one-by-one onto the stage by the performer.
Glistening melanated skin emanated from the garments through bare abdomens, sheer tops, and slitted sleeves. The ubiquitous monochromatic colorways — in tangerine, cobalt, olive, and crimson — imparted a sense of ease while simultaneously making Abijako’s distinct layering techniques inconspicuous. Organic cuts took the form of gorgeous tulip-hemmed shift dresses that bloomed into subsequent finale gowns in pure white and green. The crinoline-based gown that closed the show was particularly flattering with its large cutouts under the chest.
Abijako has a clear talent for melding personal narratives with material study, both of which are showcased in the 2022 collection. He’s made a compelling argument for the incorporation of West African silhouettes into global luxury fashion, while preserving the authenticity of his culture with an incredible debut of womenswear for Head of State.

The energy and excitement accompanying the resurgence of Boston nightlife is apparent, and nowhere is it better captured than the spirit of an outdoor improvisational dance competition — especially when that competition pits some of the country’s most gifted freestylers against each other in one-on-one battles. As the sun set over the city harbor on Friday, Sep. 10, the pier outside The Tall Ship Boston came alive with music, food, and an energy-infused performance for Red Bull’s “Dance Your Style” event.
“Dance Your Style” — a competitive freestyle dance circuit premiering in dozens of cities across the globe — gives participating dancers the opportunity to impress audiences with their “rhythm, movement, creativity, and charisma.” The Boston installation of the series, sponsored by Red Bull, featured sixteen performers hailing from places across the country including New York, Philadelphia, and even Houston.
Matchups in the tournament-style contest brought two competitors to the floor together at a time, where each was tasked with choreographing a performance on the spot. After sharing the stage for two DJ-curated songs — selections from a diverse playlist featuring hip-hop and disco, among other genres — audience members voted for the winner by raising light-up wristbands corresponding to the color of their preferred dancer’s side of the stage.
Competitors brought unique flair to each of their performances, occasionally incorporating props and even the other dancers into their routines.
“Freestyling is basically taking all the dances and putting them into one — all styles,” remarked dancer Virgil Gadson, who audiences recognize as “Lil O.” “You have to be very versatile to be a freestyler.”
Other dancers also spoke to the challenges of improvisation. “It sharpens your cleverness, it sharpens your mentality,” commented Boston native Jennifer E. Viaud, who danced under the name “Lady Beast.” “Freestyle is a way to get more in touch with your spirituality…it’s very hard to do because you have to work with nerves, you have to work with doubt.”
Yet despite the intensity of the matchups, the evening was characterized by smiles, hugs, and supportive interactions between dancers. The program also included performances from Lil Phunk — the junior team affiliate of the social organization Phunk Phenomenon Dance Complex, which aims to reach Boston’s youth through hip hop and urban dance — as well as a cameo from previous “Dance Your Style” contestants.
“I think it’s amazing,” added Viaud. “It’s fun and it’s healthy and it’s positive and this is something I think everyone needs, especially with what everybody’s going through with the pandemic.”
The entertainment took place outside the scenic Tall Ship Boston restaurant — an oyster bar atop a nearly 250-foot-long sailboat stationed in East Boston. Couches, umbrellas, and picnic tables on the pier adjacent to the ship flanked a small stage equipped with myriad lights and a DJ station. Much of the audience gathered on turf right at the edge of the dance floor, while others watched from a small raised platform.
Several members of the crowd commented on the quality of the venue, which was draped with market lights and encircled by a ring of food trucks, selling everything from tacos to lobster rolls. Audience member Zoe A. Karelas, having previously visited The Tall Ship, described the pier as “the perfect spot.”
Hannah E. McDuffie, another audience member, echoed this sentiment: “Just being outdoors with the city view, right on the water — it was such a cool vibe.”
The distinctly intimate, inviting, and lively atmosphere was the perfect complement to the dancers themselves. McDuffie continued: “All the different styles and people from different backgrounds and different cities — and the camaraderie among the dancers, too — was fun to watch.”
While the event took place outdoors, the reality of the pandemic was not easily forgotten — masks still dotted the audience and obscured staff members’ faces. Participants still expressed deep gratitude for the in-person experience.
“This past year has been nuts,” said Chimel N. Idiokitas, who emceed the event as “Real P.” “But the crowd — they gave their energy, they gave the dancers their energy. That’s all we can ask for.”
“Dance Your Style” didn’t just showcase phenomenal talent — the event succeeded in raising spirits, bringing together dancers from far and wide, and fostering a sense of community.
“It’s a blessing,” said Viaud. “That connection with humans — with humanity — is extremely important, so to be here with everybody — we are very, very lucky.”

Mariah Carey is, and has always been, an artist with a well-defined ethos. This ethos, though, shifted at a distinct moment in her career: After her split from record label executive Tommy Mattola, both Carey’s image and sonics transformed from the Christian-infused soul and turtlenecks of her early years to hip-hop samples and sultry choreography.
As above, so below: From the stratospheric transcendence of Carey’s high register to the earthy soulfulness of her chest voice, Carey’s vocals exhibit a trademark dualism. Her voice takes on qualities of the sublime and Godly (the high runs as if speaking in tongues, the low register as if a gospel soloist at a Black church) when juxtaposed with the first-blush modesty of her early period, and qualities of bodily ecstasy and rapture when juxtaposed with the overt sex appeal of her newfound freedom after her split from Mottola.
Carey’s second album, “Emotions,” lies firmly in her early period. The pyrotechnics of her virtuosic vocals are balanced by more conservative elements in her songwriting. As radical as her vocal range is, all of the songs on this album seem to be grounded by a musical grammar of the old guard — of gospel, soul, R&B, and, in the evenness and control of her technique, even classical (perhaps this was in her blood — her mother studied opera at Juilliard). This basis in tradition, coupled with the freshness of her wild virtuosity, makes “Emotions” as seminal as its auteur. And because Carey insisted on having such an involved hand in every facet of her music — she wrote and produced nearly every song — she can comfortably claim this title. Like the great pianist-composers of the 19th century, Carey wrote music that perfectly suited her instrument; every song seems to refract Mariah Carey in all her colors. Because of a combination of this primacy of the instrument and her early conservative bent, the album is far more interesting musically than lyrically.
“Emotions,” released in 1991, is Carey’s second album, and it more than sustained the star power catalyzed by her first single “Visions of Love.” Just as Carey herself was the star of her self-titled album, the title song “Emotions” was — and still is — the clear star of this one. The counterpoint between the funk aesthetics of the bass and synthesizer and the classic R&B ethos of the piano and percussion is certainly attractive and masterful in its own compositional right. That said, what sustains this song’s popularity today (including its mythologization via meme) is the same as what drove it to the top of the charts in 1991: the crazy high note climb just before the chorus. This is a gesture that repeats throughout the album, and one that defines Carey’s artistry.
Other elements of the album, while potentially nostalgic for some, read as outmoded. In “And Don’t You Remember,” the tone color of the synthesizer, the use of the tambourine, and the wet reverb all provide for an atmosphere whose forced nostalgia is hard to take in earnest. This said, the control she exhibits in pushing the fullness of her chest voice throughout her entire range to leap, in a breathtaking moment, to a string of increasingly high notes, lends the song a convincing feeling of catharsis, if not merely a jaw-dropping technical feat. A similar atmosphere characterizes “Can’t Let Go.” Perhaps this is a result of Pavlovian conditioning via the ubiquity of ’90s pop music in grocery stores, but it’s hard to get past the initial aesthetic impression of music both commodified and commoditized; even on first listen, it feels almost too familiar to enjoy.
On the album’s fourth track, “...Make it Happen,” Carey sings “And if you get down on your knees at night / And pray to the Lord / He's gonna make it happen.” This religiosity is echoed, albeit latently, in the musical atmosphere of the next track, “If It’s Over”: The combination of piano, high hat, and choir gives the song a prayerful, gospel flavor. “You’re So Cold” is the most interesting song on the album in terms of its narrative arc: The drama of the opening piano gesture and Carey’s powerhouse low register breaks into an upbeat dance, like a cavatina and cabaletta in the bel canto tradition, or the Mozartian recitative and aria pair “In quali eccessi” and “Mi tradi.” The latter comparison is apt with regard to content: Both Carey and Mozart’s songs are about the cruelty and coldness of the singer’s romantic partners. “So Blessed” expresses an opposite experience: It opens with “Lying beside you / This joy is so deep.” That such diametric views about love exist in the same album implies, perhaps, that Carey’s inventory is composed of stock emotions and not lived experience, but perhaps this simply betrays the non-confessional conservatism that characterized much of the content of her music while involved with Mottola.
In the next track, “To Be Around You,” the powerful chest voice Carey employed throughout the rest of the album takes a 30-second hiatus as she opens the song in a gauzy, breathy tone, which she alternates effortlessly with her denser, huskier chest voice. Like layers of an exquisite trifle adorned with gold leaf, both vocal textures are punctuated by the otherworldly sparkle of her flute-like whistle tones, which she leaps to effortlessly. Carey’s breathy tone softens itself further — an extraordinary vocal feat — in “Till the End of Time,” where it takes on an incredibly intimate, quasi-erotic quality; we can feel her breath on our skin as if she is whispering in our ears. The final track, “The Wind,” opens with an improvisatory, high-jazz flourish in the piano. A full orchestra of strings and a lilting high hat emerge to support a multiplicity of colors in Carey’s iconic vocals. An original re-composition of a jazz instrumental written 40 years earlier, Carey pairs the lush orchestration with lyrics about a friend killed in an accident. It is both the most musically sophisticated song on the album and the most personal, though perhaps too sophisticated to some mainstream pop sensibilities. Not every song in the album was a hit — none as much as the eponymous first track — but Carey, to be sure, shines on each one.

If there were ever a way to capture the rejuvenating power of the Arnold Arboretum, a 281-acre wonderland just a few miles away from campus, the American Repertory Theater has done it. Throughout the fall, the A.R.T.’s “Arboretum Experience” will offer visitors free audio plays, meditation movements, and pop-up concerts to embellish the average walk in the park. It seems counterintuitive — to bring an audience outside to interact with nature, yet ask them to put on headphones. Still, whether intended as an immersion in nature or an augmented reality, “The Arboretum Experience” creates a captivating event worthy of revisiting.
When audiences walk through any of the Arboretum gates this fall, they’ll be greeted by a QR code linking them to a host of interactive media. Set in present times and acknowledging the realities of Covid-19, the stories center on the Arboretum itself. Whether visitors spend their time by the rose garden or climb Bussey Hill, the audio plays create an interactive experience with a custom “stage” as visitors choose where to walk on their journey. Although the concept is commendable and the voice acting convincing, the writing sometimes detracts from the magic. One particularly cringeworthy line in “Ramona the Fearless Goes for a Ride,” an audio play about a young girl’s adventure searching for lilacs, is: “Xavier’s the name, spreading smiles my game! Elbow bump hello now that we’ve met?” Maybe the cringe factor stems from the world’s dismissal of elbow bumps since Biden and Pence bumped weenuses back in 2020; maybe it stems from the obvious ploy to show A.R.T’s virus-precautious positionality. Regardless, the line is one of many that fails to land.
Despite unnecessary leaps in the writing, the plays were intriguing and impressive — especially knowing that only seven actors voiced the characters in all four plays, learning and performing their roles in the course of two weeks. A door slams, horns blast, birds chirp, and music interlays transitions. The sound effects immerse visitors in the world of the plays, and layered dialogue and interrupted lines capture the commotion of real conversation, creating a satisfying, textured listening experience.
But if the goal is to “experience” the Arboretum, what otherwise would be pros sometimes become cons. If a visitor is walking through trees, surrounded by singing birds, rustling leaves, and chirping insects, does putting on headphones to listen to an audio play full of artificial noise replace a more authentic experience?
The movement meditations help solve this theoretical conundrum. These brief audio files serve as a guide to mindful interactions between mind, tree, and self. Whether visitors choose to hug a tree, follow breathing techniques, or meditate on the plants, the movement meditations remind them to slow down and take time to align with the natural world. This critical aspect of the “Experience” legitimizes the concept of the piece as a whole, helping visitors refocus on the profundities of this special collection of trees.
To top off, the A.R.T. has invited musical and dance artists to perform amidst the trees every Saturday at 2 p.m. This feature alone is reason enough for a visit. Opening artists Kaovanny and Evelyn Bush kicked off the weekly performances on Sept. 4 with their R&B fusion style, playing a setlist of covers and original pieces. The entrance arch of the Bradley Rosaceous Collection neatly framed the singers. There are few moments rarer than sitting beneath a tree to listen to a guitar-accompanied rendition of 50 Cent’s “21 Questions,” but these are the kind of moments visitors can expect at the Arboretum throughout the fall. So head out of the city hustle and bustle for an “Arboretum Experience” and discover some magic moments of your own.

On Sept. 16, author Angeline Boulley spoke about her young adult thriller, “Firekeeper’s Daughter,” at a virtual event as a part of Harvard’s ArtsBites series. ArtsBites, hosted by the Office for the Arts, is a series of round-table discussion events that connect undergraduate students with visiting artists. The event was a collaboration between the Harvard University Native American Program (HUNAP), Natives of Harvard College, and the Office for the Arts.
“Firekeeper’s Daughter“ follows 18-year-old Daunis Fontaine, an Ojibwe high school student who joins an FBI drug investigation after witnessing a shocking murder in her hometown. Boulley said she drew on her own experiences to create the story. When she was 18, a friend pointed out a new student at their school, who she thought would be Boulley’s type. The boy turned out to be an undercover cop.
“I just remember thinking, ‘What if we had met and liked each other?’” Boulley said. “And then I thought, ‘What if it wasn’t that he liked me, but he needed my help?’ And then this little spark of an idea — a question — was, ‘Why would some undercover investigation need the help of an ordinary, 18-year-old Ojibwe girl?’”
It took Boulley 28 years to turn that spark into a story, and another 10 years to finish “Firekeeper’s Daughter.” During that time, she worked as the Director of the Office of Indian Education in the U.S. Department of Education, working to improve the education of Native students.
At the event, Boulley discussed the importance of Native representation in children’s literature. According to Boulley, it is essential for Native authors to be the ones to tell these stories.
“I was 18 before I ever read a story that had a Native main character, but it was written by someone who was non-Native, and it pulled up a lot of harmful stereotypes,” Boulley said.
In contrast, Boulley said the Native response to “Firekeeper’s Daughter” has been overwhelmingly positive.
“My best interactions are when I’m at a book signing, and an Ojibwe woman comes up to me,” Boulley said. “Sometimes she’s not even able to get the words out, but she lets me know that she felt seen and that I got it right. And that, to me, is the best praise.”
Jason A. Packineau, the Community Coordinator of HUNAP, also praised the nuanced Native representation in Boulley’s novel, citing the lack of accurate representation in media and other spaces in the U.S.
“Representation matters when it comes to images or storylines about Native people in the media,” Packineau said. “Sometimes our storylines get so boxed in that we’re not allowed to be complex individuals, and we’re not allowed to even share similar experiences with regular other Americans.”
The students who attended the event said Boulley’s talk was interesting and gave them new insight into the process of writing.
“I read ‘Firekeeper’s Daughter’ last spring and loved the intersection of the crime and coming-of-age genres,” said Phoebe A. Barr ’24. “Also, as someone who’s interested in writing myself, I like attending author events to hear authors talk about their processes.”
Sophie M. Choate ’23 said she appreciated the intimacy of the discussion.
“With her being a debut author who had such an interesting career before becoming an author, I loved hearing her perspectives,” Choate said. “I loved that it was a pretty small Zoom meeting, so I got to ask questions.”
Barr also appreciated the wide range of questions that students brought up during the event.
“People talked about how author talks can often be formulaic, and they tried to ask her questions that aren’t always asked,” Barr said. “It wasn't a talk that confined her to only talking about the book’s focus on Ojibwe culture. But they didn’t shy away from talking about it, either.”
“Firekeeper’s Daughter” was an instant success after its release. The novel debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times Bestseller List and will soon be adapted as a Netflix series under the Obamas’ production company, Higher Ground.
“It’s Indigenous, but its reach is far beyond that,” Packineau said. “It’s just about good storytelling.”

Marvel Studios is built to ensure that each of its movies is a cultural sensation. The newest installation in its ever-growing superhero franchise, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” is no exception. The film follows Shang-Chi or “Shaun” (Simu Liu) who, despite extensive efforts to escape, finds himself drawn back to his father’s (Xu Wenwu, played by Hong Kong acting legend Tony Leung) criminal organization, Ten Rings. The first Marvel film with a majority Asian cast, “Shang-Chi” challenges traditional depictions of the American hero, marking an essential new chapter for the world’s most influential cinematic universe.
Yes, Marvel’s latest superhero movie lives up to its high praise. It’s funny and intelligent, subversive and new. By installing an Asian American protagonist and engaging in worldbuilding steeped in Asian culture, the film interrogates persisting and outdated ideas about who “gets” to be an American hero — and, more broadly, who “gets” to be an American in the first place.
That being said, “Shang-Chi” is also just a thoroughly entertaining movie. The film’s success lies in its ability to draw meaningfully from Asian heritage while celebrating the classic features of any good Marvel story. It earns an impressive place in the MCU’s catalogue of action films precisely because it manages to fold quintessential Marvel themes — a dark past, apocalyptic crises, top-tier comedic relief, and exhilarating combat sequences.
The film opens with Shang-Chi having escaped his draconian past by becoming a hotel valet under the moniker “Shaun” in San Francisco, along with his longtime best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When Shang-Chi gets into an altercation with members of his father’s criminal organization, he is forced to make a choice: yield to his family history or forge his own path. His journey takes him not just to an underground fight club in Macau run by his sister Xu Xialing (Meng’er Zhang), but to Ta Lo, a fantastical village with mythical Chinese animals.
Chief among the star-studded performances in “Shang-Chi” is undisputedly Tony Leung who embodies the complexities of his character so well that he elevates the entire film. The Hong Kong superstar breathes life into a complicated villain whose aggression toward the world is at least partially fueled by genuine grief following the loss of his beloved wife. Unlike some two-dimensional Marvel villains, Wenwu is easy to sympathize with, in large part because of his tragic character arc as a man who yearns to love his children, but is incapable of loving.
“Shang-Chi” is acutely aware of the position it occupies between American and Asian cultures, and demonstrates this self-awareness in many different ways. For one, a good deal of the film is in Mandarin — an unprecedented move for a Marvel movie. The frequent shifts between Mandarin and English allow actors to embody the genuine culture and atmosphere of their characters’ upbringing, rather than force them into stilted dialogue tailored to a white American viewership. The film also alternates in setting between the United States and Asia. But even the location scouting is given careful consideration — previous Marvel movies like “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Black Panther” respectively feature Seoul and Busan, two iconic South Korean cities. Yet these urban landscapes are simply passed through, treated as flashy and exoticized places. “Shang-Chi” breaks this pattern because these spaces are where the protagonist calls home, as seen in the detail put into the film’s production design.
An underappreciated yet critical element of “Shang-Chi” is its immaculate soundtrack. Far more than background noise, the songs inject rhythm and energy into the film. From indie star keshi’s sultry and melodramatic vocals in “War With Heaven” to Anderson .Paak’s smooth, atmospheric “Fire In the Sky,” the film’s soundtrack is chock-full of Asian talent. Perhaps most emblematic of “Shang-Chi”’s revolutionary place in the Marvel cinematic universe is Saweetie and 88rising member NIKI’s “Swan Song.” A paean to the power of a new generation to disrupt the status quo, it perfectly encapsulates “Shang-Chi”’s broader cinematic project: “Out with the old, in with the new,” the two singers croon at the song’s opening. “It’s a new dawn, and it ain’t you.”
Indeed, “Shang-Chi”’s explosive box office numbers augurs a new dawn for Asian representation in Hollywood — and in social, cultural, and political discourse at large. Racking up a staggering $71.4 million during its domestic box office opening, “Shang-Chi” swiftly became one of the most impressive pandemic openings, second only to “Black Widow”’s $80 million. As of Sept. 19, the film’s global box office earnings total over $320 million. It’s symbolic — cathartic, even — that despite the intense anti-Asian sentiment during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is a film so deeply significant to Asian Americans that injected vitality back into a collapsing industry.

On Sept. 6, the internet broke over a steamy video of Oscar Isaac gently caressing Jessica Chastain’s arm at the 2021 Venice Film Festival Red Carpet Premiere of “Scenes From a Marriage,” an adaptation of Ingar Bergmann’s 1973 Swedish TV miniseries of the same name, which stars Chastain and Isaac.
As Chastain smiled for the cameras, her arm around Isaac’s shoulders, the “Dune” actor slowly leaned down and kissed her upper arm before the two pulled each other into a tight embrace. Twitter users, understandably, lost their collective minds over the pair’s enviable chemistry. Some especially colorful commentary includes “My brain is showing a 404 error,” “I AM VERKLEMPT,” and Mindy Kaling’s Instagram comment on one of Chastain’s posts: “Why is Oscar Isaac the only person allowed to kiss your inner arm?” There are also, predictably, many tweets suggesting that the pair are secretly a couple or expressing sympathy towards Isaac and Chastain’s actual spouses.
The fact that the video has been viewed over 11.5 million times since it was uploaded highlights the unique niche that “thirsting” occupies in the entertainment space. With social media as its main driver, it’s no surprise that “thirsting” quickly rises to mainstream media consciousness and becomes the focus of endless interviews and questions. Asked about the video in question on the “Today Show,” Chastain exclaimed, “We have all been locked in our houses for so long, you know, when this video went viral, I was like, people just need to see people touch! And hold each other!”
Though it is probably heightened by the intensely touch-starved masses finally emerging from quarantine, this phenomenon is nothing new. It was only a few years ago that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga’s performance of “Shallow” at the 2019 Oscars was met with countless stories about their supposed attraction cropping up weeks and months after the event, much to the chagrin of the actors. Tom Holland and Zendaya have also been routinely romantically linked since the release of “Spider-Man: Homecoming” (a matter that may have finally been put to rest this past July with news that the pair was seen kissing in a car). I, for one, have seen my fair share of the “Celebs Read Thirst Tweets” videos put out by BuzzFeed Celeb on YouTube, the majority of which have millions — if not tens of millions — of views.
“Thirsting,” then, can be used as an effective marketing strategy as much as a fun distraction. As notable author and film critic Martha P. Nochimson notes in her book “Screen Couple Chemistry: The Power of 2,” “The chemistry of the onscreen media couple… can create those special conditions through which torrents of popular culture energy are channeled as a form of intelligent communication.” This communication is as much between studios and consumers — and their wallets — as it is between actors and viewers. From Venice we are led to the video, from the video to an interview with the actors about the video, from the interview to the trailer of the show in question, from the trailer to the show, and from the show to other content on that streaming platform. And we’ll shell out the $10 or $15 dollars a month to gain access to that content.
Does this mean we have to feel bad for every thirst tweet we consume? Should we despair at the thought that every arm kiss between Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain could just be an elaborate marketing ploy designed to grab our eyes and extract fistfuls of our dollar bills? Is it morally just for entertainment conglomerates to weaponize our thirst? Perhaps it’s possible to reconcile these questions with the thought that, in the end, maybe all that matters is the way Oscar Isaac’s eyes crinkle as he smiles.

This article contains spoilers for Season One of "The White Lotus." 
Most individuals turn to television for a distraction — for a momentary escape from the capitalist grind, awkward social interactions, and financial or familial woes which sprinkle exhaustion onto the end of every day. While some franchises feed this impulse — nothing alters reality like “Keeping up with the Kardashians” or “Game of Thrones” — others leave viewers with narratives and characters which feel utterly too familiar.
Premiering on HBO Max on July 11, the satirical comedy-drama miniseries “The White Lotus” follows the lives of wealthy guests and attentive staff during their week-long vacation at an extravagant Hawaiian resort. While the show depicts a variety of character dynamics amongst its 11-person main cast, the most clear reflection of both the implicit and explicit privileges enjoyed by whiteness and wealth comes through in the show’s depiction of the Mossbacher family.
The Mossbachers are a combination of four conflicting personalities: Nicole (Connie Britton), a girl-bossing, passive-aggressive mother; Mark (Steve Zahn), her less successful husband; Quinn (Fred Hechinger), their screen-addict son; and Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), their performatively-woke daughter. While each shoulders their own unique brand of ignorance, they are united by a lack of understanding of the greater social backdrop against which their blissfully simple lives have played out.
While Nicole gains impressive traction as a CFO in a male-dominated industry, her lean-in style feminism sways too hard towards patriarchal apologist. Despite preaching that she “climbed a hellish ladder… working [her] ass off” to reach her position, she fails to confront the role that her privilege played in the process. Instead, she remains concerned about “how tough things are” for straight white men, like her husband and son, who she says are being “alienated from the culture right now.”
But this lessening of white male privilege she references shouldn’t be a bad thing. As someone who believes she had to work against extreme adversity to find success, it seems unfathomable that she doesn’t advocate for the advancement of other women in the workforce. She believes she paved the way, yet refuses to break down structures which barricade others.
In this sense, Nicole shares the performative nature of Olivia, her daughter. While Olivia rotates between activist buzzwords and pretends to read political theory, the way she treats those around her shows a lack of empathy — the core value of advocacy. It is not progressive to seek out relationships with your best friend’s boyfriend or criticize a stranger’s appearance.
Despite frequently attacking her family’s conservatism, her tendency to seek out relationships with her best friend’s love interests and disregard others’ emotions shows she is much more like them than she believes, sharing their selfish disregard for others.
Like in the real world, it falls upon the BIPOC characters in “The White Lotus” to educate members of the Mossbacher family on their shortcomings.
It is Paula (Brittany O’Grady), Olivia’s non-white college friend who tagged along on the family vacation, who pushes back against the family’s problematic behavior.
Through a budding relationship with Kai (Kekoa Kekumano), a native Hawaiian staff member at the hotel, Paula recognizes the exploitative relationship between the resort and the Hawaiian culture it capitalizes off of. By buying the land out from under the indigenous people, The White Lotus resort actively harms the people it benefits from.
However, for the Mossbacher family and others who stay in resorts like this, it is difficult to see themselves as perpetuating these colonial structures. Instead, it is simpler to remove responsibility and view themselves as passive participants.
“What do you stand for?” Paula asks the Mossbacher family at dinner. Met with blank faces and deflection, Nicole answers, “Most activists don’t really want to dismantle the systems of economic exploitation — not the ones that benefit them...They just want a better seat at the table of tyranny.”
While Nicole intends to take a jab at reformers, she is really commenting on her own family’s approach to social change. Why would the Mossbacher family or the wealthy white demographic they represent change their actions when they continue to benefit from their stagnancy?
Although it would be untrue to claim that the Mossbachers never faced conflict — they did have a set of $75,000 bracelets stolen in a robbery gone awry — they always emerge relatively unscathed. While Kai, who poached the bracelets in order to provide for his family, is presumed to be either hiding or facing impending punishments, the Mossbachers recover the bracelets, Mark and Nicole’s marriage emerges from the weeds, and all they are left with is Mark’s healing black eye. Why would they want to change the structures which pushed Kai towards theft, when they inevitably benefitted from that very exploitation?
Call it unjust or unfair — “The White Lotus” is simply a reflection of real life. There are millions of people who view themselves as proponents of social change, yet are unwilling to take steps which may lessen their hegemony. Rather than shy away from this fact, “The White Lotus” successfully forces viewers to confront their complacency in these systems, and hopefully determine meaningful ways of enacting change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The production, release, and aftermath of “Donda” can be summed up with one image: a hurricane. Intentionally or not, that’s also the title of one of the album's tracks. And, like a hurricane, Kanye West’s raging winds surround an empty hole — the record itself.
It is tempting to view “Donda” as a provocative series of publicity stunts, instead of as a traditional album. These stunts include, but are not limited to: a feud with the legendary rapper Drake, a filed name change from Kanye West to Ye, a staged wedding with West’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian, and West setting fire both to himself and a replica of his childhood home.
“Donda” was originally scheduled for release on July 23. Then it was pushed to Aug. 6. Wait, no — scratch that — it was delayed until Aug. 26 when it finally came out — oh, it didn’t? It was postponed again. Shortly after, on Aug. 29, “Donda” was finally made available to the masses. That is, until West lashed out at his record label, Universal Music Group, for releasing the album without his authorization.
For such a highly anticipated album, the actual content of “Donda” is quite lackluster, with only a few memorable songs. Many critics were quick to point out that “Donda” isn’t West’s finest work. In fact, the album has a lower rating on Pitchfork than the album “Peppa’s Adventures” from the British cartoon “Peppa Pig.”
Still, mixed reviews aren’t stopping people from listening to “Donda.” After its release, many of “Donda”’s songs rose to the top of the charts on streaming services, topping the US Billboard 200 and achieving a record-breaking number of streams on Apple Music and a second-highest debut on Spotify.
However, the substance of “Donda,” which is mediocre at best, might not be the driving factor behind record-breaking sales and streams. It seems that the success of West’s album has less to do with the music and more to do with the spectacle of West himself.
Among the numerous tweets under the twitter hashtag #“DONDA,” you will find tweet upon tweet about West himself, from both fans and critics. There are tweets about everything from Kanye’s feud with Drake, to how popular West is on the charts, to merciless trolling of West. Surprisingly little is said about the rapper’s actual music.
“Donda” is a perfectly ordinary album. Were it not for West’s barrage of publicity stunts, would anyone want to listen to it? It seems its his fame, or rather infamy, that has already turned the album into a hit, making West millions. Clearly, “Donda” has been worth it for West; what’s less clear is if it’s worth it for listeners.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A white male professor is “cancelled“ for inappropriate and insensitive acts that provoke outrage among students. Another male professor frequently interrupts his female co-professor, completely changing the direction of class discussion. A young Black professor struggles to get tenure. Did this all happen on Netflix’s “The Chair,” or did it happen at Harvard? The answer is, well, both.
“The Chair” is an original Netflix dramedy starring Sandra Oh as Ji-Yoon Kim, the chair of a failing English department at the fictional Pembroke University. The series has been praised for its authentic portrayal of academia’s absurdity, showcasing matters of diversity, cancel culture, and corruption. While the show is not based on one particular institution or event, Pembroke’s Ivy League-esque elitism and co-creator Annie Julia Wyman’s history as a Harvard English PhD student point to Harvard as a potential source of inspiration.
Many scenes are all too familiar: Student reactions to Bill Dobson (Jay Duplass) doing the Nazi salute in class remind us of the backlash against David Kane, and Yaz McKay’s (Nana Mensah) struggles in acquiring tenure reopens the not-so-old wound of losing Cornel West after tenure disputes. I laughed as Pembroke’s ignorant dean expressed the belief of universities everywhere that anything can be solved with a letter of apology. I shuddered watching Elliot Rentz (Bob Balaban) talk over McKay as they lectured together, immediately brought back to my experience in a class co-taught by a man and a woman. I can still picture the sea of eye rolls among students in response to our male professor unnecessarily interrupting our female professor mid-sentence, mid-thought.
As a Harvard undergraduate studying English, I was both excited and hesitant to watch the series. I knew that such an incredible cast would create a great piece of entertainment, and that I would relate to many elements of the show. At the same time, I worried that the experience would be embarrassing, even painful, if the show was too realistic in its portrayal of the faults of an English department.
Although “The Chair” accurately captures many frustrations of college and academic life, I am thrilled to say that some elements, such as the show’s portrayal of an English department with overwhelmingly old, white professors, outdated curricula, and low respect for student input couldn’t be further from the truth at Harvard. In my experience, Harvard’s English department is very diverse, filled with faculty drawn from a range of different age groups, genders, races, and backgrounds.
A primary reason for the failure of Pembroke’s English department is the antiquated nature of certain courses, along with the professors that teach them. One of the older professors, Joan Hambling (Holland Taylor), takes pride in having ignored her student evaluations for decades. Another, Rentz, hasn’t changed his curriculum in thirty years, expressing aversion to modernizing course materials and activities. They teach to nearly empty classrooms, grasping for student participation.
Where are all of the other students, you ask? They fill the classrooms of McKay and Kim, the closest Pembroke has to Harvard English professors. McKay’s course, “Sex and the Novel,” drew so many enrollments that the end of lecture yielded a flood of students into the hallway. This semester, I added “Sex, Gender, and Shakespeare” to my Crimson Cart — not very far off!
Every English concentrator at Harvard has to study the classics, but even the oldest stories are tied to the present day and taught in innovative ways. In “Arrivals: British Literature 700-1700,” we connected Old English epics to modern issues and embraced creative assignments like curating a Spotify playlist. Most of Pembroke’s professors are stuck in the past. Ours, or at least those I’ve studied with, know how to keep up with the times.
Our department also advertises different ways to get involved as undergraduates on departmental committees. And when new courses are introduced, like English 10, 20, and 97 — the first editions of which took place in the past year as part of new concentration requirements — professors beg for our feedback at the end of the semester, always looking to do better.
I became an English concentrator because I felt like the department genuinely cared about my experience. I’ve always felt acknowledged and respected as a student. One professor offered every student a personalized book recommendation at the end of the semester. Another sat with me for over an hour on a bad day, making me a cup of tea and sharing some invaluable life advice.
I initially thought that this article was going to be an exposé on the faults of Harvard’s English Department as reflected by “The Chair.” But as I watched the show more closely and reexamined the opportunities I have as an English student, I realized that the differences far outweigh the similarities. That’s not to say there isn’t work to do — the biased history of literature, more specifically the literary canon, requires that English departments frequently reevaluate what is being taught, and by whom. Departments at other universities may also more closely resemble Pembroke's lack of warmth and diversity, desperately in need of an upgrade.
In the first episode, Kim emphasizes the importance of English departments for “modeling critical thinking” and “stressing the value of empathy.” Their department goes on to deviate from these values, but Harvard English embodies them. I can’t speak as a member of the faculty — maybe they would find the professor-to-professor or professor-to-dean dynamics of the show more relatable and compelling. I can, however, speak as a member of the student body when I say that Harvard English shines brighter than ever in comparison to the parody of a department at Pembroke.

From the start, Kota the Friend’s newest single “‘96 Bulls” sounds familiar. The lazy marimba chord progression sets the tone for the song, giving it a laid-back, almost tropical feel: a variation on the formula that has come to define Kota’s easygoing style. This progression — by far the song’s most salient feature — also pairs well with the song’s simple drumline.
Most importantly, however, the track is a good match for the part casual, part sincere vulnerability that Kota shows from the opening lines of this deceptively deep song. Naming an autobiographical song after the 1995-96 Bulls, a nearly unbeatable NBA Championship team led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, might appear to be a rather conceited artistic choice. And yet, with Kota’s skill, it is anything but.
The key is in the chorus, which features the line “I’m back on my bulls**t” four times in eight lines. In a song in which Kota both brags about his wealth and success and speaks to his flaws and emotional vulnerability, this line — the heart of the song — expresses Kota’s self-doubt about the path he has chosen in life.
But here, Kota plays a genius trick on our ears. The title of the song also suggests that this line could be written as “I’m back on my Bulls s**t,” allowing Kota to confidently, almost arrogantly, liken his own success to that of MJ’s championship Bulls.
Through this line, Kota thus reveals a duality in his own character, and perhaps even an uncertainty about his own identity. It speaks to Kota’s relatability as a rapper, not only in his honest lyricism, but in how he presents himself. It also speaks to how seriously he takes his craft, and how talented he is at endowing his casual sound with profound meaning.
“‘96 Bulls” embodies this duality even in its non-verbal elements, especially with the switch in beat and flow after the second chorus. Here, as his producer pitches down the chord progression and adds trap-like snares and high hats to the drumline, Kota skillfully switches his flow from the slower, methodical delivery of the first two verses to a faster, more punchy style.
And though switches like these have become popular after their conspicuous appearances in songs like Travis Scott’s “SICKO MODE,” Kota’s application of this technique is more than just a change in sound: It is an artistic choice that reveals a second side to his musical self yet to be seen up to this point in the track, again reinforcing this motif of two-fold identity. With his versatility as an artist on full display in “‘96 Bulls,” Kota the Friend draws attention to his inherent duality as a person.

In the latest of Netflix’s forays into television, writers Amanda Peet and Annie Julia Wyman (who completed her PhD in English at Harvard in 2017) crafted “The Chair,” a new miniseries offering an engaging, critical take on the struggles that people of color still face within the ivory towers of higher education. “The Chair” follows savvy professor Ji-Yoon Kim (Sandra Oh) as she is promoted to chair of the English department at Pembroke University, a fictionalized Ivy League-type institution. Delving into her struggles with a fickle love life, an aging and failing department and the difficulties of single motherhood, the show goes far beyond solely focusing on inequality within academia. With its six strikingly short, thirty-minute episodes, “The Chair” does an excellent job of leaving audiences wanting more.
The miniseries begins with an impressive yet hilarious introduction to the beautiful campus and its surrounding town. With the echoes of “Gloria in Excelsis Deo” ringing in the background, Ji-Yoon is first seen gawking at the immediate demands of her new position. She discovers that she is in over her head almost immediately, as not even her literal chair is functioning: It snaps almost as soon as she sits down.
While managing a department of mostly dated professors who lack the ability to relate to students passionate about life and their futures, Ji-Yoon also has to deal with one of the few professors not in the senior citizen category: Bill Dobson (Jay Duplass). This one man, still reeling from the loss of his wife, causes significant strife for Ji-Yoon as she takes the helm of the beloved English Department. Though their chemistry and possible romantic history are clear from their first scene together, it’s never fully explored. By the end of the season, Ji-Yoon and Bill’s relationship still does not come across as fleshed-out. It may be because of the nature of their positions as coworkers, or the showrunners’ reluctance to bog down their fast-moving dramedy with romantic backstories, but this aspect of the show feels unpolished, contrasting sharply from the rest of the well-curated production.
While the relationship between Bill and Ji-Yoon feels under-developed, it is the relationship between Bill and Ji-Yoon’s daughter Ju-Hee “Ju Ju” (Everly Carganilla) that perfectly captures the joy of childhood and portrays the amazing impact one great person can have on another’s life. Bill, although a burgeoning alcoholic and irresponsible father himself, treats Ju Ju with kindness and support. Bill takes her on adventures and helps watch her while Ji-Yoon is trapped at work, trying to manage the department’s challenges. This simple familial relationship is secondary within the show, but captures themes of redemption and friendship.
Bill does not have the same easy kinship in many of the other relationships in his life. With his wife’s recent passing and his daughter moving away to college and cutting ties, Bill is left sad and alone. In his first lecture he accidentally projects some highly NSFW footage of his wife in labor then proceeds to make a Nazi salute and mock the fascist regime of Nazi Germany. This act, shortsighted and damning, causes a cascade of backlash against Bill and the University Administration. Ji-Yoon is caught between protecting the university and someone she cares for deeply, and Bill is quickly torn off his academic pedestal. Clearly, the actions Bill took were grossly unprofessional and wrong, which the students of Pembroke are quick to point out. Through that storyline, the show explores underlying themes of racism, insensitivity and reckoning, illustrating how more and more university students across the country are no longer tolerant of “one bad joke.”
Even while Bill and Ju Ju’s time on screen together is movingly orchestrated, Ju Ju and Ji-Yoon’s scenes feel just as carefully portrayed to create the opposite effect. Their interactions are frustrating and raw, adding an element of realism as they navigate Ju Ju‘s rejection of her traditional Korean name and resentment around being adopted. This fraught mother-daughter relationship between Ju Ju and Ji-Yoon brings a needed sense of interpersonal grounding and strife to the story, distracting from Ji-Yoon’s professional struggles at Pembroke.
As the show continues, the audience is also introduced to Yaz Mackay (Nana Mensah), an up-and-coming professor seeking tenure. As a woman of color herself, Ji-Yoon tries to support her goals, hoping to see the first Black woman gain tenure and the “distinguished lectureship” in the English Department. However, she faces frustrating obstacles to recognition; for example a senior professor, Dr. Elliot Rentz (Bob Balaban), disapproves of her interactive teaching style and dislikes his own role in the tenure process as the one writing Yaz’s recommendations. As he wields the power to either grant her tenure or deny it, the effects of the school’s entrenched, institutional racism become more and more clear.
Although never overt, the racism evident in the department stands in the way of Ji-Yoon’s plans to support talented academics and modernize the department. In one instance Dean Larson (David Morse) implores Ji-Yoon to give white, pseudo-academic David Duchovny (David Duchovny) the Distinguished Lectures honor rather than acknowledging one of the department’s most popular professors. Throughout the series, Ji-Yoon and Dr. Mackay are both treated as lesser and disrespected by university administration despite Ji-Yoon being the chair of the department and Dr. Mackay the most popular professor with acclaimed publications in notable journals. Ultimately, the show offers a cutting look at institutionalized bias as it affects elite schools, showing the power of administrative suggestion and pressure to push out diverse faculty.
The only thing that could have improved “The Chair” would be a longer series runtime, with more time to explore the show’s many subplots. With only six 30-minute episodes, the audience barely has a chance to fully invest in the familial struggles between Ju Ju and Ji-Yoon, the chair’s potential romance with Bill, and the interplay within the eclectic, challenging English Department. If only to give Dr. Joan Hambling (Holland Taylor), a sweet but fiery professor with a penchant for Chaucer, more screen time, “The Chair” certainly deserves a second season and will hopefully be returning with new installments in the future.

Since her debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2010, Black Widow has been through quite a complicated journey. Portrayed by controversial actress Scarlett Johansson, she was the only female Avenger in the MCU’s first 11 movies, and her motley appearances are best characterized as incohesive.
Over the course of eight Marvel movies, Black Widow has been written as flirty, morally ambiguous, and selfless. On other occasions, she has been taciturn but still sexualized. Other times, she is sensitive and dorky with a wicked sense of humor. While the MCU is leagues better at consistently characterizing their heroes than the DCEU, the various writers who have worked on Black Widow’s character have struggled to come to a satisfying consensus about who she really is.
For example, it’s been hammered home that Natasha Romanoff, the woman behind the moniker, has a checkered past where she did awful things, but for a while it remained unclear what actually makes her a bad person. We never saw any details of her past and were also told very little about it. According to “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” her greatest flaw is not that she’s hurt or killed innocent people — it’s that she can’t have children. The film explicitly uses this to call her a “monster” — and her supposed love interest agrees with her. It would be one thing for a character to believe untrue negative things about themselves, but the narrative very clearly reinforces this view as correct.
Speaking of romance, one is hinted at between Black Widow and Hawkeye in “The Avengers” (and this is a relationship that happens in the comics), but in “Age of Ultron” it’s revealed he suddenly has a secret family. So Black Widow naturally starts a relationship with the Hulk, the guy whose destructive alter-ego is paralleled with Natasha’s infertility. After this, Natasha uses him, then he leaves. This relationship is mentioned in a couple of movies before being dropped in “Infinity War.” Also in the comics, Black Widow had a relationship with the Winter Soldier, but this is only hinted at in the movies. This as an adaptational choice is fine, but it’s interesting that Bucky and Natasha have parallel backgrounds — they were trained in the same place — yet “Captain America: Civil War” makes clear that the Winter Soldier is bad because of what he did whereas the Black Widow is bad because of who she is. The depiction of Black Widow’s romantic history on screen ranges from mildly incompetent to outright offensive, and the lack of care put into this aspect of her character matches her inconsistent characterization.
Fans have been campaigning for a Black Widow movie since her debut in “Iron Man 2,” and yet when it finally happened, the lead actress was allegedly underpaid for it. Whatever your thoughts on Scarlett Johanssen, this lawsuit is important for actors everywhere because if Disney will allegedly screw over the actress who topped Forbes’ 2019 list of highest paid actresses, then how will they treat members of the cast and crew who haven’t built names for themselves yet?
So, after a long, long wait, the “Black Widow” movie is here. Director Cate Shortland and screenwriter Eric Pearson were handed a shoddy patchwork of character moments and created a unified, coherent character — treatment which Black Widow has rarely seen. She was the only one to act like an adult in “Captain America: Civil War,” and she was the only one on Earth to continue leading the Avengers after the blip, a feat which “Black Widow” contextualizes with further insight. Moreover, as an individual, she has always valued the Avengers as a family even though they did not reciprocate; this movie tells us why she’s built that way, and why she stood by Captain America in “Infinity War.” It gives Black Widow’s parents who loved her even though they couldn’t save her, and a sister she can be there for despite failing in the past. A beautifully subtle scene shows how Natasha might have wanted a family of her own, and how she couldn’t have it — a pain her sister Yelena does not share. It allowed her and Yelena to center their trauma around themselves and their growth. It makes the people who taught little girls to become killers the monsters, not the women those children grew up to be. Repeat: The survivors are not the monsters, Joss Whedon.
The film does everything right with her character with minimal retconning. There is a smart sense of humour as well as exciting action scenes. There’s an allegory to human trafficking alongside fantastic directing and cinematography. There’s even a good script — though the audacity of Eric Pearson to think a period joke would be acceptable is shocking, as is the fact that it was the actors who rewrote the joke — it features a great story that centers on saving yourself, sisterhood, and going back for the people you’ve left behind. It depicts how desperate people can do bad things (we finally see Black Widow do an actual bad thing!) and the value of genuine forgiveness over getting a free pass.

All this isn't to say, however, that this film is above reproach. It isn’t the best film ever made. It isn’t even the best Marvel film ever made. But it was a beautiful exit for the character who for a very long time was ‘The Girl’ of the MCU. And it did its best to repair some of the misogyny of “Endgame.”
In “Infinity War,” the only woman in a team of six (Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana) was thrown off a cliff and murdered by her abuser — and the narrative validated that as love. In the sequel, “Endgame,” the only woman in a team of six jumped off a cliff — while this was actually love, the narrative tells us that since Natasha didn’t have children or a family, her life didn’t matter as much. She “deserved to die.” The fact that these two important female characters were killed in exactly the same way, at the same story beat in each movie, without closure or even really being mourned, is deeply depressing.
“Endgame” fails to treat most of its female characters better than this — a bunch of female characters standing next to each other in the finale does not bestow individual importance or replace actual character development or value.
“Black Widow” told us that this was wrong — that you cannot Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V any random female character and call that development. And it said that not only did Natasha Romanoff matter inherently as a person, but that she did have a family.
Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, is certainly not the end-all of female characters. But when the first female-led MCU film was the 21st one, and there have still only been 2.5 (“Ant-Man and the Wasp” counting as co-lead) against 17.5 male led (15.5 of which featured white men incidentally) ones, Marvel is asking this movie to represent “Woman Superhero Movies” — perhaps even “White Woman Superhero Movies,” as Marvel has yet to announce even a plan for a movie led by a woman of color.
I’m not asking for a dozen more “Black Widow” movies — I want to see lots of superhero films about women of color, queer women, and women with different body types. I want to get to the point where a female-led superhero movie is just another entry into the superhero genre instead of the spark of a debate on whether female-led superhero movies are worth making. I want there to be so many that they’re treated just like whenever DC churns out another mediocre film about White Guy #3.
But when in the “Eternals“ trailer the characters wonder who’s going to lead the Avengers “now that Captain Rogers and Iron Man are both gone,” as if Black Widow didn’t do it herself for five years, it’s clear she’s still undervalued even in-universe.
“Black Widow” was the send off Black Widow deserved. Ain’t it a shame that it took them a decade to make it?

No artist epitomizes the last four years of Latin pop like J Balvin. Ever since the 2017 worldwide sensation of his and Willy William’s “Mi Gente,” the Colombian reggaetonero has notched hit after hit. In 2018, he replaced Drake as the most-streamed artist on Spotify. Amid this meteoric rise, J Balvin seemed not so much a reggaeton singer as the genre’s mainstream embodiment. His early songs told stories of partying, desire, and seduction from such a generic perspective that it was hard to find a hint of individuality in the lyrics. Instead, the catchy beats, booming production, and over-the-top aesthetic took center stage. For proof, look no further than Balvin’s phenomenal 2020 concept album “Colores,” where he named each song after a color of the rainbow.
On Sep. 10, with the release of his latest album “JOSE,” Balvin reversed his prior commitment to aesthetic over substance. It’s telling that the title of the project spells out Balvin’s first name, rather than the usual anonymizing initial. More than a powerful confirmation of his continuing ability to produce hits, Balvin’s latest project takes him in surprising musical direction by foregrounding what his previous records sidelined: his own personality. Who is the man behind the hits? The songs on the album paint an expansive portrait.
José immediately demonstrates unforeseen skill as a rapper with an understanding of his place in musical history. “F40” opens the album with Balvin asserting his legendary status, interspersed with snippets of dialogue from Arcángel, a reggaeton legend of the 2000s. Later, in the standout “Billetes de 100,” Balvin raps energetically over a hard-hitting trap beat, filling his verse with pop culture references from Sylvester Stallone to Don Quijote. The playful persona serves as an entertaining and welcome departure from Balvin’s usual trite lyrics, and on “7 de Mayo,” he flexes even harder. Through verses riddled with wordplay, complex rhyme schemes, and references to his influences, Balvin constructs a rich framework for the story of his childhood and ascendancy.
But José the individual really shines through in the one-two punch of “Querido Rio” and “La Familia.” The former, a moving ballad for Balvin’s infant son, interpolates a recording of the child’s heartbeat over simple yet heart-warming lines like “llegaste para darme luz” (“you arrived to give me light”). Sincerity also suffuses “La Familia,” an upbeat trap-infused anthem for all those who Balvin loves. As he names his family members and collaborators, the gratitude in his voice is palpable. It’s a wonderful surprise: As a protagonist for his songs, Balvin is remarkably compelling.
The album’s only flaw comes in its bloat. Whereas his most recent album’s ten-track brevity gave each song sharp coherence, not all of the 24 songs on “JOSE” should have made the final cut. “Te Acuerdas de Mí,” featuring Yandel, literally repeats the chorus of the previous song, the Sech collaboration “Una Nota.” It’s as if instead of adding Yandel’s mediocre verse to the original version — or cutting it entirely — Balvin chose to split the song into two nearly identical tracks, cheapening both. Similarly forgettable are the tracks saturating the middle of the record. The chorus of “Pa’ Guayarte,” for example, feels repetitive and lacks energy. Even the usually high-spirited and expressive singer Ozuna, whose addition might have saved the song, slouches into a repetitive flow, his verse dragging. Those songs, as well as “Lo Que Dios Quiera,” “Fantasías,” and “Ganas De Verte,” tell the audience nothing new about Balvin or his sound. Rather, they sound like crude, forgettable attempts at hit-making.
That’s not to say Balvin has lost his penchant for producing actual chart-toppers. On the contrary, finely cut gems of perfect reggaeton fill out the remainder of the tracklist, reminding listeners of the most visible aspect of Balvin’s persona: his tireless release of international bangers. Against a contagious Skrillex beat on “In Da Getto,” Balvin’s breathy delivery creates an urgency that lures the listener into the artists’ imagined party — and begs repeated streams (the song has already amassed over 100 million on Spotify). “Qué Más Pues?” is an instant classic, blending heavily autotuned vocals from Balvin and Maria Becerra with synths like ethereal bell chimes to create an intoxicating sense of longing. This is the J Balvin listeners know and love, whose extensive sonic palette lights up wild nights.
The final song on the album, the 2020 hit single “UN DIA (ONE DAY),” epitomizes Balvin’s talent and his increasing ubiquity. On a song seemingly controlled by Dua Lipa’s signature style, Balvin has slyly inserted himself and Reggaeton’s Dembow beat into the fold of the ascendant English pop star. Even as “JOSE” takes us deeper into the star’s personal life than ever before, J Balvin remains a global icon at the height of his powers.

Radiohead’s newest single “If You Say The Word” is a mellow combination of the English rock band’s past eras and a look toward their future. The band’s members have been working on personal projects since the group’s last release in 2017, and many fans doubted the possibility of any new Radiohead content. “If You Say The Word,” however, is the first of several unreleased or reworked songs that will feature on “Kid A Mnesia,” a forthcoming compilation album that will combine the two-decade-old albums “Kid A” and “Amnesiac” with brand-new material.
“If You Say The Word” feels reminiscent of tracks on “Kid A” and “Amnesiac” like “Life In a Glasshouse” and “In Limbo.” The gloomy atmosphere, jazzy drum beat, and dreamy vocals ground the single in the sound of early 2000’s Radiohead, making it feel strongly connected to its companion albums. The song had been in the works since 1999, and its eerie enveloping intro is a classic Radiohead feature. Thom Yorke’s hazy and calm vocals start the first verse; an early line about being “stuck in rainbows, shattering glass” is an evocative reference to the band’s 2007 album “In Rainbows.” Released as a “pay-what-you-want” download, that album was a statement about the indispensable nature of music and having faith in its value, a belief that Yorke recently reaffirmed in an interview. Yet the phrase “stuck in rainbows” here also contains another meaning in the context of the subsequent line, “where you miss the moment, watching it pass,” and the single’s broader themes. It’s a metaphor for being stuck in a limbo between the present and an imagined future, just as rainbows exist in the limbo between earth and sky. In this sense, the metaphor represents the way in which the pressure to plan and prepare for the future can prevent us from appreciating the present.
The second verse continues this train of thought as Yorke sings,“when you spend your life wishing on a star” and later, “when you forget how lucky you are,” possibly criticizing the music industry’s focus on constantly producing more and more content while straying from authenticity. The instrumentation builds around the second chorus, creating an ethereal sound. The bridge once again touches on the disingenuous character of life in the spotlight, commenting on how quickly friendships can change, and then leads into the final chorus, ending with “I’ll come running.” Radiohead’s criticism of continuously aspiring for success reflects the band’s broader commitment to an authentic and personal connection to the practice of music creation and consumption.
Ultimately, “If You Say The Word” is a surprising yet welcome piece of art from Radiohead, and sets up high expectations for the remainder of “Kid A Mnesia.”

On Sept. 7, MUNA released “Silk Chiffon,” the band’s first single after signing to Phoebe Bridgers’ label, Saddest Factory Records. To mark the occasion, Bridgers features on the record, branching out of her traditionally soft, indie roots into a lighthearted and dance-worthy style. The collaboration of these artists, both beloved by the queer community, has added an undeniably catchy song to the growing list of queer anthems.
MUNA, an openly queer group, has never shied away from writing about gender and sexuality. “I Know a Place,” for instance, is about creating safe spaces for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Where “Silk Chiffon” differs from the band’s prior discography is in its sense of pure elation. Everything is kept light and fun — “like silk chiffon,” as each pre-chorus ends. Rarely are queer relationships presented in art, whether musical, visual, or otherwise, without homophobic forces of resistance. This single contains no mention of homophobia, violence, or shame. Instead, MUNA and Bridgers brilliantly capture the pleasure of intimacy and the joy of embracing one’s identity without guilt.
Few might expect the diverse styles of Bridgers and MUNA to work well together. MUNA is known for their big sound, rooted in powerful bass and elaborate electronic backgrounds. In contrast, Bridgers is known for her delicate, airy tone. And yet, the two manage to blend beautifully on “Silk Chiffon.” MUNA dials back slightly while Bridgers leaps out of her comfort zone and into the euphoric single. The vocals transition smoothly between lead singer Katie Gavin and Bridgers as they alternate verses, uniting to create bright harmonies in the chorus.
The instrumentals of “Silk Chiffon” aren’t unique, falling into the generic sound of bubblegum pop with a steady beat and synthesized instruments — which isn’t necessarily bad. Regardless, the song’s simple yet sensual lyrics more than compensate for its lack of musical originality. Listeners are invited to an intimate moment between two women, with lyrics like “that’s how it feels, oh, when she’s on me.” And what could possibly be more carefree than someone rollerblading against the colorful sky with a tote bag slung over their shoulder? “Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on / Bag on my side 'cause I'm out 'til dawn,” Gavin and Bridgers sing.
“Silk Chiffon” is a collaborative success that triumphantly represents the queer community. The single is sure to be on the setlist of Bridgers’ North American tour, where MUNA will be opening for some of the shows.

Imagine a two-year-old decked out in knee pads, elbow pads, palm pads, a striped ski mask, and an oversized bike helmet. All that on top of the suffocating bulkiness of snow pants and a puffy jacket. Oh, and a pair of really tight, blister-inducing shoes with blades attached to the soles. That was me when my mom taught me how to skate.
I learned to ice skate long before I learned to ride a bike. I can do both now, but the adage “it’s like riding a bike” sometimes subconsciously translates to “it’s like skating” in my mind. Something that I’ll never forget how to do, no matter how long it’s been.
Recently, while visiting Portland, Ore., I had the chance to skate. The rink was a tiny oval smack in the middle of a shopping mall, surrounded by Forever 21, Cinnabon, and some other mall favorites. Nonetheless, it was my first time on ice in well over a year and I was thrilled. I try to skate a few times every winter, but Covid-19 closures had kept me away.
Later that day, while browsing the shelves of Portland’s famed Powell’s Books, I stumbled upon the vibrant blue and red cover of “Beautiful On The Outside,” a memoir by former Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon. From his writing emerges a witty, formative, and unapologetically authentic story of the glamorous and grueling sides of a career in figure skating. A few glossy pages in the middle are filled with photographs of the characters in his story. Family, coaches, competitors, friends, foes. The attention he grants each of them prompted me to think of the people who have defined and composed my journey; those who’ve helped form the most salient images of my own life. In particular, my mentors.
“Mentor” is a pretty difficult term to define in the first place. Teacher is too formal; advisor feels too stuffy. Mentorship isn’t only about teaching skills or giving advice — it isn’t even just about guidance. In sport, you may find a mentor in a coach, or you may not. As essential as good mentors are, there is no predetermined path to finding one.
The kind of mentor I’m thinking of understands, in some meaningful way, your experiences, your emotions, your story. They are someone who shares parts of their story with you. Perhaps you’ve found mentors in classmates, siblings, or professors. Think back to the things they’ve told you. I’d bet some of the stories really resonate.
At figure skating competitions, the “kiss and cry” is what they call the area skaters go immediately after performing to await scores from the judges. The name comes from the kisses that ensue after receiving good scores and the tears that flow after bad ones. In the “kiss and cry,” the skater will most often be accompanied by their coach. It’s in moments like these, moments when you have somebody with you to celebrate the good and to help lighten the weight of the bad, that a good mentor really shines.
Mentorship finds a way to travel through generations. Rippon’s memoir chronicles the journey towards his own Olympic dream to him becoming a mentor for a new generation of Olympic hopefuls. I’ve slowly come to a better understanding of the role a mentor plays over the course of my time at Harvard; perhaps because lately, in the most modest of capacities, I’ve been able to play the role myself for others. I don’t have any wisdom, really, to give out, but I do find myself sharing stories from my earlier college years to the occasional listener. I’ve accumulated a few of these stories that I sometimes think might benefit someone who’s just starting their journey here.
Campus life is so full of this mentorship, story sharing. Navigating Harvard can be so overwhelming, but the mentors I’ve found through clubs, classes, and just chance meetings have been so invaluable. Mentorship can be little things that you sometimes don’t even realize.
If we all wrote down these stories we have, we’d each end up with a memoir of our own. But for now, let’s keep sharing them with each other. Don’t hesitate to discover mentors in the most unlikely of places. Learn from their stories; this sharing is essential to the vitality of our community. Like riding a bike (or skating), some of these stories will stick, and become part of yours — become part of you.
When my mom brought a two-year-old me to the ice rink, she wasn’t just teaching me how to skate. Once upon a time, long before I was born, she was a competitive skater. She was sharing that part of her story with me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost everything about the return to in-person classes has been joyful — there is nothing more refreshing than walking through the crisp early autumn air on the way to lectures; nothing more melodious than the laughter that fills a classroom when a professor cracks a joke; and nothing more reassuring than the confused looks of our classmates when an esoteric concept flies over all of our heads.
However, not everyone has been able to escape online learning: In the past seven days, 67 new graduate and undergraduate students have tested positive for Covid-19, and 85 individuals on Harvard’s campus are currently in isolation. Over the past four months, there have been 242 undergraduate cases.
For these students in isolation, attending classes in person is impossible, and keeping up at all has been difficult and confusing. While some classes such as Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” have recorded and live-streamed lectures, not all classes have been quite this accessible.
Given that course structures vary widely across and even within departments, it makes sense that professors have adjusted to the circumstances differently. However, it is urgent and necessary that — even with these differences — all professors come up a way for isolated students to attend class and not fall behind academically while dealing with an illness.
To that end, it is each professor’s responsibility to devise a course of action that can be taken by students who need to be isolated — one that works in concert with their unique classroom environment, and which promises to protect the isolated students’ quality of education while maintaining the safety of their peers.
Holding professors accountable in this regard will help prevent last-minute attempts that have hitherto been inadequate for preserving students’ learning — take, for example, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences suggestion that professors have a teaching fellow or student use a smartphone to record and upload a lecture to Canvas for students in isolation. While we appreciate the University’s effort to suggest a unifying policy to ensure the uninterrupted learning of those in quarantine, students need more. Quick and universal “fixes” like these become unworkable when we consider the vastly differing class formats that exist across campus: In a politically-oriented Government seminar, for instance, students might feel uncomfortable having their discussions on possibly polemical topics recorded, uploaded, and placed in the hands of other students.
Subject to this disconnect between policy and practice, professors are likely to opt out and let students miss class in the event of a necessary isolation. These students may be able to catch up by reviewing lecture slides that are later uploaded to Canvas, or by receiving class notes from a friend, but they’ll have missed out on the discussions, questions, and materials that make classroom learning as edifying and engaging as it ought to be.
To lift the burden and stress off of students who may test positive, FAS needs to release guidelines that require all professors to have a preemptive plan for those who go into isolation. From there, allowing professors the flexibility to create individualized and innovative protocols — in other words, handing instructors the flexibility that they need to best meet the needs of their specific course — should generate better outcomes for students who have to spend a part of the semester in the confines of four walls.
There is no policy that can be applied to every course, but every course does need a policy.
Finally, it is not a new concept for students to be unable to attend class because of an illness, but the Covid-19 pandemic has concretized and raised the stakes of a previously amorphous risk. Hopefully, once we’ve found creative solutions that work for students who are sick with Covid-19, professors will continue to use them to accommodate any student health concerns, not just the infamous coronavirus.
Whether we’re sick or healthy; socially distant or close together; entrenched in a global pandemic or blessed with normalcy, we must have plans in place for students to continue learning. While we’re thrilled to be back in the classroom, we need to be prepared for the times when health concerns take that privilege away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To My Harvard Admissions Letter,
Once upon a time, you were everything I wanted. You landed in my unsuspecting arms — or inbox rather — at a time when I needed you most.
You were the only thing I could hold close while the world sat six feet apart. You gave me a vision of what the next four years would look like when I couldn’t even anticipate what would happen the next day. You handed me a sliver of hope in a hopeless time, so I took that hope and ran with it.
I began to spend my days with stars in my eyes — dreaming of what life would look like with you, my own golden ticket, by my side.
It was the opportunity of a lifetime: a chance at receiving a top-tier education. A brand new community. An expansive alumni network. An abundance of library resources. Access to more classes than I could ever imagine. A new set of traditions. A new way of thinking. A new place to call home.
And I hoped that that would be enough. That the perfect image I had of you would hold true. But as I begin my sophomore year, I no longer see you through the lens of an eager high school senior on Ivy Day. After taking a closer look, I can see that there are cracks under your perfect, lustrous finish.
Time and time again, Harvard has released statements emphasizing their support for their community members of color and the importance of maintaining a diverse group of faculty members — yet their actions tell a different story.
It was the second month of my first semester when the first crack appeared. We were outraged when the news broke that David Kane, an instructor in the Government department, had allegedly authored racist blog posts and was inviting Charles Murray — a highly controversial political scientist — to speak to his Government 50: “Data” class. Shortly after, students began circulating a petition for the University to re-evaluate his role in the department. I was confident that Harvard would listen and our voices would be heard, but I was wrong.
After a brief two-week break, the University allowed David Kane to resume teaching that fall, failing to acknowledge the harm that his statements imposed on students of color. Kane taught again in the spring semester.
I hoped that this would be the last time. The last time that the University would ignore students’ voices. The last time they would fail to uphold their promise to support their community members of color. The last time that their actions would form cracks in the perfect image that you, my admissions letter, presented to me when I saw you for the first time.
But I was left disappointed.
Seven months later, students began circulating a new petition in support of Professor Cornel R. West ’74 following his threat to depart from the University after it denied his request for tenure consideration — a denial that called Harvard’s “support” of their Black scholars into question.
Professor West was many things to many people, but to Black students, he was a beacon of hope. An amplified Black voice in a world where our voices are constantly silenced and a prominent scholar who commanded the attention of everyone in the room. While I was a freshman at the time, I never had the opportunity to be a student in one of those rooms, and now that Professor West has left the University, I never will.
Another crack had appeared, and I can only expect that more will keep appearing.
At the end of the day, you, my admissions letter, are simply a bunch of words on a piece of paper, and Harvard has since taught me that words alone mean nothing.
While I still acknowledge how privileged I am to attend this institution, I cannot ignore its flaws. It is my responsibility as a member of the Harvard community to acknowledge its shortfalls. To continue to speak up and use my voice. To admit that, today, I can see the cracks within your perfect exterior.

After racking up more than $25 million in legal fees defending its admissions practices against anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, Harvard filed suit against its excess insurance company Friday for allegedly refusing to cover legal fees in the ongoing SFFA case.
Harvard College wrote in a brief filed with the Massachusetts District Court that it had exceeded the $25 million policy limit allotted under its primary liability insurance policy with American International Group, which triggered a secondary insurance policy it held with Zurich American Insurance Company. Harvard’s attorneys allege Zurich was contractually obligated to cover the remaining legal fees, but has failed to do so.
Though the brief did not specify the amount that the College is requesting Zurich reimburse, a minimum of $75,000 in controversy is necessary for the Court to review the case. The University is also asking the court to compel Zurich to cover future legal fees in the admissions suit up to its policy limit of $15 million.
Zurich has denied responsibility for the “defense costs” Harvard has incurred from the ongoing SFFA lawsuit, claiming the College failed to provide sufficient prior notice, according to Harvard’s brief. Harvard’s attorneys wrote that Zurich “had knowledge of” the claim due to widespread national media coverage.
The College officially reported the SFFA suit to Zurich around May 2017 — when its initial insurance limit under AIG was “far from being exhausted” — yet Zurich denied said claim in a letter on Oct. 25, 2017.
According to the brief, the College has paid all premiums and complied with all conditions under Zurich’s policy, and the filing argues the insurance company is obligated to pay the full amount of defense costs beyond the limits of Harvard’s primary policy. The primary policy with AIG has a $25 million limit and $2.5 million deductible.
Zurich spokesperson Robyn Ziegler declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
SFFA first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, arguing that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions practices discriminate against Asian American applicants and violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.”
Massachusetts District Court judge Allison D. Burroughs — the same judge now assigned to the lawsuit against Zurich — ruled in favor of Harvard in October 2019, and the First Circuit Court affirmed the ruling in November 2020. SFFA petitioned the Supreme Court in February to review the decision and the Supreme Court delayed reviewing the petition in June, electing to ask for the views of the solicitor general.

The University is closing Harvard Yard to the public every evening through mid-October, requiring affiliates entering the Yard to show their Harvard ID to security guards between 5 p.m. and 3 a.m., during which only Johnston, Thayer, Widener, and Solomon Gates are open.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the closures — which began for this academic year after freshmen returned to campus in August — are meant to “support the safety and health of our student population” in the first few weeks.
“We appreciate your help with this as we give the first-year undergraduate community the opportunity to adjust to campus life while observing the appropriate public health guidance,” stated a Yard Bulletin email sent to freshmen Monday morning.
While the College has not restricted students from hosting non-Harvard affiliates — who would not be subject to the University’s vaccination and testing requirements — in their dorms, the closure effectively prevents non-Harvard affiliates from visiting Yard dorms in the evening.
The policy was first implemented last fall and will be lifted on Oct. 11, per Dane.
Several students interviewed in the Yard Monday evening said the policy has led to confusion and a variety of inconveniences.
“I was actually traveling back from shopping with my parents and they were like ‘Oh no, [your parents] can’t come in, the Yard is closed,’” Niyah M. Lockett ’25 said of her experience moving in to Canaday. “So I had to take all of this stuff that I bought at the local Target — I had to carry it up by myself.”
The closure of 21 of the gates surrounding the Yard after 5 p.m. has also increased walking time for many students.
“It’s such a force, especially because I live in Pennypacker, which is not in the Yard,” Maia Patel-Masini ’25 said. “It just takes a lot longer and then I’m outside longer than I want to be.”
L. Tania Soerianto, a student at the Graduate School of Education, added that the closures also impact graduate students.
“Because we don’t live in this area — we live in the graduate housing — it’s just a longer walk for us, honestly,” Soerianto said. “It’s kind of confusing where to go.”
Despite the inconvenience, Patel-Masini said the closures make her feel safer when walking at night.
“At night, when there’s barely anyone out, I’m glad to know that the people on campus are just people who go here or are affiliated here,” she said.
Lockett said the changes did not make her feel safer, noting that “it’s not like we did background checks coming here.”
Several students said they wished the College provided more communication regarding the closures and the reasons behind them.
“Please let us know what’s happening,” Lockett said. “It’s not necessarily a good or bad thing, because we don’t really know much about it, but it would just be nice to have that communication and have that transparency.”
She added that the closure hours seem arbitrary to her.
“It’s not like Covid gets off work and then decides to come to Harvard’s campus,” she said, referencing the 5 p.m. closure time.

Artist Tomashi Jackson and Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin discussed Brown II — Jackson’s new exhibition — at an event Monday to promote the Radcliffe Institute’s Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, which aims to understand Harvard’s historical ties to slavery.
A fusion of painting and printmaking, Brown II was inspired by the 1955 landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education II, which intended to end segregation in American public schools.
Jackson said she developed an interest in learning more about the intersection of race, court cases, and education after attending city hall hearings and learning about a friend’s involvement in saving yellow bus services for Boston Public Schools.
“I realized how little I knew, how little I know about this landmark web of cases that transformed and impacted all the public spaces I’d understood since my birth in 1980,” Jackson said. “I didn't realize as a child in Los Angeles, [who] took the school bus to the USC campus, to go to my performing visual arts magnet school, that all of us were beneficiaries of a hard-fought battle for educational access."
Jackson's decision to learn more about the casework led her to the Yale University Law library, where she said she was inspired to create artwork based on the 1955 Supreme Court decision.
“It opened up the door into a conceptual space for me to explore the perception of color, and its impact on the value of human life and public space with the focus on the lives of Black children,” she said.
Jackson then came to Harvard to learn more about the Brown II case, which she said she was unfamiliar with before visiting the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute.
She said she hoped to better understand the delay between the Court’s 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka and the 1955 case, Brown II.
“What did it mean that even after the Supreme Court unanimously decided that all of us should have access to education, what did it mean that a year later it still wasn't happening?” she asked.
Schlesinger Library, which Jackson referred to as a “treasure trove,” played a pivotal role in bringing Jackson’s exhibition on Brown II to life.
Her work was inspired by the lives of Pauli Murray and Ruth Batson, both of whom dedicated their lives to desegregate American public schools. The Schlesinger Library contained rich archival material on Murray and Batson, and library staff also offered their assistance throughout the entire research process, per Jackson.
She added that Schlesinger is “the only library of its kind,” citing its focus on women in America.
Despite the challenges posed by Covid-19, Jackson’s exhibition came to fruition. She called the occasion “historic."
The Brown II exhibition will be on display at Byerly Hall until Jan. 15. It is currently open for Harvard affiliates and will open to the public starting Oct. 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard undergraduates voted 96.46 percent in favor of an Undergraduate Council referendum on shopping week, teaching fellows explained in interviews the stress that shopping week causes them due to fluctuating student enrollment.
Earlier this month, a petition gained more than 1,300 signatures in support of shopping week, the system in which students browse courses the first week of class before registering. Students rallied to preserve shopping week last Tuesday, marking the first day of voting in the referendum.
Shopping week and “uncertain schedules” for teaching fellows and faculty have been a subject of debate for several years. Throughout 2018, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' administrators, faculty, and students debated the potential elimination of shopping week; later that year, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh proposed a pre-registration system as a replacement. In 2019, the FAS voted to retain shopping week until at least 2022.
Though teaching fellows said they understand the appeal of the system — which allows undergraduates relative freedom in course selection — several teachers raised concerns in interviews about the resulting unpredictability of schedules and teaching positions.
Aparna Gopalan, a teaching fellow in the Anthropology department, said graduate students who cannot make major financial decisions ahead of time have to face the “hidden cost” of shopping week.
“Do I need to buy or rent a car?” she said. “Where do I rent an apartment? Should I rent in Cambridge, or should I not rent in Cambridge and live in the other location where I've always lived, because people, they all depend on a schedule, and I don't know my schedule.”
Due to fluctuations in student enrollment, Gopalan said her first teaching appointment in 2019 was not finalized until approximately three weeks into the semester. She said she was assigned a section that evening and had no time to prepare properly.
“After the semester ended, my students wrote in my course evaluations that the TF came unprepared on the first day, and that's part of my employment record for my whole life,” she said.
Ege Yumusak ’16, a teaching fellow in the Philosophy department, criticized the University for not prioritizing student workers' job security.
“We find ourselves scrambling to rearrange sections and make sure that people are employed during this time, but our experiences of tumult and stress are solely a function of Harvard administration refusing to give appointment security to student workers,” Yumusak said.
On Monday, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 sent an email updating Harvard affiliates on the University’s contract negotiations with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, including the University’s tentative agreement with the union to pay teaching fellows with cancelled courses 70 percent of what they would have received for teaching the course, triple the original percentage of compensation.
Abigail Orrick, a teaching fellow pursuing an education Ph.D. who also teaches undergraduates in one of her courses, said she would prefer a system that allows students to explore classes freely while also providing enough time for teaching fellows to plan ahead.
“It seems like a system that really, really benefits the undergrads that makes TFs feel financially unstable and very stressed isn't good, and a system that helps TFs and instructors not feel stressed but makes undergraduates feel like they can't choose their courses well isn't that good either,” Orrick said. “What other solution could we potentially create all together?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts in policy-making, journalism, and political organizing convened to discuss the challenges facing American democracy, such as voter restriction and political representation, at a virtual event at Harvard Law School on Monday.
The session was the first of six speaker series hosted by the HLS Election Law Clinic, a newly-established clinic, during which speakers posed broad questions about the future of American politics and governance.
The online conversation, which was moderated by Harvard Law School professor Nicholas O. “Nick” Stephanopoulos, contrasted the Law School’s focus on voter engagement with the deepening crisis of American democracy.
“While it’s an exciting time for election law at HLS, it’s a more fraught moment for democracy in America,” Stephanopoulos said. “Allegations of voter suppression, election subversion, gerrymandering, fill the airwaves and the pages of legal briefs,” Stephanopoulos said.
“There’s more election litigation than ever before in American history,” he added.
Representative John Peter S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), chair of the House of Representatives Democracy and Reform Task Force and a principal author of campaign finance reform legislation, said that if passed, H.R. 1, the For the People Act, would reorient the country during a moment of political mistrust and frustration.
“We will have done something transformative that can really position the country again to embrace our democratic ideals and begin to chip away at that deep cynicism, which we’ve seen building up over the last few years,” Sarbanes said.
Sarbanes added that H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act are the “two key ingredients” to ensure ordinary Americans feel represented in their democracy.
Esosa Osa, the research and policy director of Fair Fight Action — a national organization dedicated to protecting and expanding voting rights — said that following the Capitol Hill insurrection on Jan. 6, there was an influx of legislative efforts to undermine voter representation.
“It was a non-stop onslaught, eventually culminating in the passage of S.B. 202 and multiple local bills that were going to have a tremendous and profound effect on elections moving forward in Georgia,” Osa said.
In addition to oppressive voting laws, Osa argued that the consistent, widespread intimidation and harassment of individuals involved in helping to register and count votes has created a scenario in which democracy was “truly in peril.”
“You end up in a situation where we have counties being taken over in Georgia where one third of election workers are considering resigning across the country because of the number of threats that they are facing just trying to do a really fundamental, democratic job,” she said.
Evan L. R. Osnos ’98, a staff writer for The New Yorker, argued that though there are historical parallels to today’s political crisis, particularly in the transition between the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era, our current political situation presents a uniquely dangerous combination of disinformation and cynicism in government.
Anti-democratic strategies developed to substitute the “public will with the power of money,” such as voter suppression tactics have become increasingly effective due to technological leaps made in the past decade, according to Osnos.
“Those tools are, in fact, modern tools,” Osnos argued. “We have to recognize, in some sense, that they are different from some of their predecessors — they are distinctly modern technologies. It’s worth acknowledging that, because that means that the degree of our response and the tools of our response should be different too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously passed three policy orders at a Monday meeting to reevaluate the City’s indoor mask mandate, expand BGLTQ-friendly housing in Cambridge, and recognize the unionization efforts of workers at small business coffee chain Darwin’s.
Co-sponsored by Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, and Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, the mask mandate policy order will be negotiated with the Cambridge Public Health Department to establish metrics that allow Cambridge residents to better understand the requisites needed to lift the mandate.
In response to an increase in Covid-19 cases in Cambridge, the City issued an emergency order effective Sept. 3 requiring the use of face masks in indoor public spaces.
Mallon said that city officials are divided over how best to approach the decision to lift the mask mandate.
“There didn’t seem to be a lot of consensus, and some of our residents have expressed concerns around not having any metrics or stated goals, and a desire to have those metrics defined to have a goal to work towards and have transparency around decisions.” Mallon said.
The council and CPHD have not yet declared when they will lift the indoor mask mandate, as they are awaiting public health data to inform their decision.
The council also considered an order, sponsored by Councilor E. Denise Simmons, that requested City Manager Louis A. DePasquale compile the City’s previous efforts to create BGLTQ-friendly housing and provide recommendations to expand such housing.
Simmons explained that she has made “numerous concerted efforts” to explore opportunities for establishing BGLTQ-friendly housing in Cambridge and discussed Boston’s progress in this area.
“The civil rights and liberties that so many have worked so hard to achieve over the past several decades are in an ever changing state,” Simmons said. “There is very much a need and desire to curate the kind of housing that can indeed cultivate the community aspect for the LGBTQ community.”
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said he was “excited” for Simmons’s proposal and acknowledged challenges faced by BGLTQ residents, specifically senior citizens.
“LGBT seniors are impacted by decades of oppression and face a unique set of challenges including disrupted connection to families of origin, discrimination, isolation, and less opportunity to age in a social and economically secure location,” he said. “These challenges, and more, put this population at greater risk for health problems, mental illness, addiction, homelessness, and more.”
Toward the end of the meeting, the councilors also voted unanimously to go on record in support of Darwin’s UNITED, a recently established union for workers at the Cambridge coffee chain.
“I am happy to be supportive of this,” Nolan said. “Darwin’s is an exemplary small business, and I hope that with this order, we can walk the talk of supporting, celebrating, affirming, and uplifting all our small local businesses.”
Workers at Darwin’s sent a letter to management on Sept. 15 detailing their intentions to unionize. The workers requested Darwin’s voluntarily recognize them through a card-check process and agree to friendly negotiation.
“I hope we can celebrate this victory and focus on those companies that don’t treat workers well, that don’t voluntarily agree to recognize unions through a card-check,” Nolan said.

UPDATED: September 22, 2021 at 2:15 p.m.
Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and business leader Penny S. Pritzker ’81 donated $100 million to the Economics Department to support the construction of a new department building, Harvard announced Tuesday morning.
Pritzker, who served as Commerce Secretary under President Barack Obama, concentrated in Economics while at the College. In 2002, Pritzker was elected to a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers and was elected to the Harvard Corporation in 2018.
“I hope this gift will enable and galvanize a new era for Harvard economics, with a spectacular building that will support and accelerate collaborative approaches to teaching and research not just within the department but across the University,” Pritzker said.
Currently, the Economics department is housed within the Littauer Center for Public Administration, built in 1938. For more than a decade, however, Economics faculty have raised concerns that the building is inadequate for Harvard’s largest undergraduate concentration.
“The real losers are our undergraduates, our graduate students, and the Harvard community as a whole as we lose our ability to find a meaningful center for economics in Cambridge,” said James H. Stock, former chair of the department, in an interview with The Crimson in 2007.
In the early 1990s, University administrators and Economics department members worked together to generate plans for a renovation of Littauer; however, a renovation has never materialized. As of 2015, Littauer still lacked functional air conditioning.
The new building is set to be built on Harvard’s Cambridge campus, near Littauer, according to the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
Economics professor Amanda D. Pallais said in an interview with the Gazette that the gift will help “facilitate so many more interactions among faculty and students.”
“Faculty will no longer have to choose between being around their colleagues and meeting with their research teams,” she said. “The gift will also allow for the graduate students to be in the same building as professors, making it so much easier for a student to stop by for advice.
Meanwhile, Economics department chair Edward Glaeser told the Gazette that well-designed buildings “foster the kinds of interaction that create breakthroughs.”
“This gift will enable us to attract the best students, ensure early-career faculty come here, and, just as importantly, energize those who are here are to do their best work,” Glaeser said. “We want the proximity that enables ideas to spring from one mind to another — that’s how we believe collaborative creativity happens.”
Pritzker is chair and founder of the global investment firm PSP Partners and has founded other businesses in sectors including real estate, senior living, and financial services. Pritzker also currently serves on the boards of Microsoft and Icertis. She has a net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes.
In Chicago, her hometown, Pritzker founded P33, a nonprofit that aims to invigorate the city into a technology hub by prioritizing sustainable and focused economic growth for women and individuals of color.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow highlighted Pritzker’s commitment to public service in an interview with the Gazette.
“Penny Pritzker is everything we hope an alum will be — an accomplished and principled leader, a true and tireless public servant, and a loyal supporter of Harvard and of other institutions devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of economic opportunity,” Bacow said.
Pritzker’s gift is among multiple nine-figure donations to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in recent years. In 2015, hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson pledged $400 million to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences that now bears his name, and in 2014, hedge fund manager Kenneth J. Griffin ’89 donated $125 million to support financial aid at the College.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay told the Gazette that the gift would go far in supporting the economics faculty — “some of the world’s most respected, acclaimed, and influential researchers and educators.”
“I share Penny’s excitement that the gift will help support an exceptional new generation of Harvard economics leaders, giving them the tools and spaces they need to advance bold new ideas including a focus on equity and opportunity — furthering the entire department’s capability to enable real difference in the world,” she said.
CORRECTION: September 22, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Pritzker's investment firm, PSP Partners, had $205 billion in assets under management at the end of fiscal year 2021. In fact, PSP Partners is a private firm that does not publicly report its assets. The reported figure is the assets of PSP Investments, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada.

Harvard continued its string of close matches, staying within touching distance all game but ultimately falling by a score of 1-0 to Quinnipiac in Connecticut on Saturday in a game in which the Crimson controlled the majority of possession and outshot its opponents.
Despite conceding only its fourth goal of the season in as many games, two of which went to overtime, Harvard (1-2-1) lost its second straight game, again by a slim margin. The game was the first all-time meeting of the two schools, meaning Quinnipiac now holds the edge at 1-0 in the all-time tally.
Despite the unfavorable scoreline, the Crimson held the ball for large periods of time and created a litany of chances, outshooting the Bobcats sixteen to fourteen and grabbing the edge in shots on target, with six to Quinnipiac’s four. Harvard also held the advantage in corners, with seven to the Bobcats’ six.
“We conceded fewer shots than in previous games,” junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson said. “Our pressure high up in the field was looking better as well but it's something we want to improve even more in order to create more chances.”
The Crimson was fouled fifteen times, while committing just ten fouls, which resulted in four yellow cards for Quinnipiac compared to just one for Harvard.
“We dominated possession for certain periods more than we've done previously,” Nilsson continued. “That's definitely something we want to continue to do and become even better at since it will help us break down opponents.”
The match prolonged a streak of close matches for the Crimson, with all three of its most recent games being decided by a goal or less. Despite dropping two in a row, Harvard has conceded few goals this season thanks to a solid back line, consisting of both experience and young talent.
“Our communication from the back starting from our keeper is what has enabled us to be solid defensively,” senior midfielder and captain Paolo Belloni-Urso said. “By having a mixture of upperclassmen and younger guys we have had the right balance of agility, experience, and leadership in the back.”
The young center back pairing of first-year Jan Riecke and sophomore Nik White has been pivotal for the Crimson, with White playing every minute and Riecke missing only ten minutes so far this season. The youngsters are flanked by seniors Havard Hjermsted and Fernando Docters, who add experience to the young core.
“We want to keep building our team chemistry especially with having two new classes, the first-years and sophomores,” Belloni-Urso said. “With that said, we want to learn from our mistakes so when the Ivy League games come around we will be in a position to be successful.”
Harvard faces a busy week, as it heads back on the road Tuesday night to face Merrimack in North Andover, Mass. at 7 p.m. Then the Crimson returns home to face Vermont at Jordan Field on Friday night, also at 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Time stood still as first-year outside hitter Corrine Furey soared through the air, drawing back her hand. Flinging it forward, she spiked the ball, sending it sailing past the outstretched arms of the opposing team’s libero before hitting the floor. With this kill, Harvard (3-6, 0-0 Ivy League) erased a two set deficit to defeat American University (5-6, 0-0 Patriot League) and capped off its triple-header at the Howard Invitational in Washington, D.C. this past weekend.
American had gotten off to a quick start, winning a tight first set 25-21 and carrying this momentum into the second by stunning the Crimson 25-13. The third set would prove to be a different story, however.
“We [made] changes in different matchups, and that...clicked for us,” said Harvard head coach Jennifer Weiss. “We did start out slow, we made mistakes right off the bat, and those unforced errors got [us] in a little hole,” she admitted, “so we made adjustments.”
By rotating her players on the court, Weiss gave the Eagles matchups with different, unfamiliar Crimson passers and blockers. This switch allowed Harvard’s outside hitters to take control of the match. Along with Furey, who ended the contest with eight kills, sophomore hitters Katie Vorhies and Ashley Wang produced 16 and 10 kills, respectively. Junior attacker Jaimie Rao also contributed 15 kills in the come-from-behind win.
In the third set, it was now the Crimson’s turn to get out to a quick lead of 6-2. Although American University made a comeback, evening the score at 9-9, Harvard managed to build off their adjustments and cut back on unforced errors to seal the set, 25-20.
The fourth set saw the teams trading blows, with one team never gaining more than a three-point advantage over the other. Harvard went on a five-point streak, going from 6-8 to 11-8 with crucial kills and blocks from Vorhies and fellow sophomore hitter Olivia Cooper. Nevertheless, American slowly stopped this slide and evened the score at 19-19. Two kills from Furey and Wang, however, would eventually end the fourth set, 25-22. Weiss’ strategy was proving successful.
One specific example of taking American out of its comfort zone came with the substitution of junior setter Bella Almanza. Along with 20 assists, she fired off three service aces, providing the team with some much needed momentum.
“[Almanza] served so aggressively, and it got us ahead,” Weiss recalled. “Everyone was excited for her, and the energy was really positive around that. She runs a little bit of a different offense, so that was a big shift,” especially because it occurred in the middle of the match.
Regardless, the junior, along with the other upperclassmen, provided much needed leadership for a young Crimson team of which eight of the 16 players had never played in college before this season.
“Our upperclassmen have the experience of what it’s like to be on this Harvard volleyball team, and they’re a key part of our success,” Weiss commented. “[Almanza] has that experience and that confidence and court awareness to [serve aggressively]. The mentality [of the team] is to compete, so I think that shifted for us in that we got out on a high note, we took [the Eagles] out of their offensive system, and they couldn't run what they wanted to run...because we served at them really well.”
The Crimson would need all of the experience it could muster, as the beginning of the decider was also gridlock. American erased Harvard’s early leads of 6-3 and 8-4, and the Eagles pulled within two points of victory at 13-11. Kills from Rao and Furey brought the score to 13 apiece, and a missed spike from an American hitter and Furey’s final hit ended the five set brawl.
Playing from behind was the theme throughout the invitational. The team fell behind in its first match on Friday against No. 13 Oregon (8-1, 0-0 Pac-12), with the Ducks handily claiming the first two sets 25-14 and 25-19. The Crimson was not discouraged from its slow start, though.
“We had a good attitude,” said Vorhies when discussing the challenge Harvard posed for one of the top-ranked teams in the nation. “Once we got into those first couple sets, we [realized] we had nothing to lose. Our energy level elevated, and we [got] excited for each other and were competitive about every single point.”
The Crimson fought back to win the third and fourth, both 25-23, benefitting from 16 and 15 kills from Vorhies and Rao, respectively. Defensively, first-year libero Lindsey Zhang notched 14 digs, while first-year outside hitter Nicole Prescott saved 11. The team lost in a tight decider 16-14, however.
“I think our energy outmatched Oregon’s, and once we had that element we were able to bring it into the next two matches,” Vorhies concluded.
In the second match of the day, Harvard faced off against Howard University (1-8, 0-0 MEAC). Once again, the Crimson dropped the first set, 23-25. The team quickly adjusted and battled through fatigue, winning the next three sets 25-23, 25-21, and 25-21. Prescott hit a team-best 17 kills along with 14 digs, and many of the team’s other first-years and sophomores posted double-digit assists, kills, and digs.
With nine games under its belt, the team is looking forward to starting Ivy League play on Friday against a strong Dartmouth squad.
“I think we got better every day during...the preseason of non-conference competition,” Weiss asserted. “Dartmouth’s a good team right now, winning a lot of matches, so we’re going to come up with a good game plan, set it up, and go after it, both offensively and defensively.”
“I feel like we really unlocked a new level of energy and competitiveness this past weekend,” Vorhies said, “and we’re all excited to take that into Ivy League games this season.”

Finally having an in-person semester means the return of midterms, men in suits, and David Malan’s sweat. If that isn’t enough to look forward to, being on campus means we’ll finally be able to enjoy New England’s least-worst season: fall! With the official start of fall happening tomorrow – and as a New England native – here are my favorite ways to enjoy the fall that doesn’t involve crying over midterms.
Apple Picking
You don’t need to join a pre-professional club to go on an apple picking retreat! Russell Orchards is only a short Uber away from the Ipswich stop on the Newburyport Commuter Line and has even fresher fruit and cider than the plums in Dunster dhall. So grab a couple of friends and your canvas tote (you definitely have one) and get pickin’!
Explore the Esplanade
If you’re looking to stay in Boston, you can pedal your problems away on a BlueBike, a great and inexpensive way to explore the city. You can find bikes outside of Dunster and around the Square, and bike paths stretch down the river and through the famous tree-lined Boston Esplanade.
Take a Hike
To get a glance at New England’s famous fall foliage, tear yourself away from your screens and head to the hills for some hiking. Popular hikes include the Blue Hills (MA), Mount Monadnock (NH), or the Franconia Notch Ridge (NH) for more adventurous hikers, all accessible via Zipcar. The Harvard Outing Club also offers frequent weekend hiking trips to New Hampshire or western Massachusetts for those who are too lazy to plan their own trips. If you don’t have a day or a weekend to travel upstate, walking to the Quad is also an option for a long and strenuous hike.
Providence Ghost Tour
Your Tinder date isn’t the only ghost you’ll encounter this fall! Get spooked by the Providence Ghost Tour, a walking tour of the haunted streets of the East Side of Providence, RI. MBTA Commuter Rail passes are just $10 for the weekend — the cost of a single Felipe’s burrito — and an easy way to get out of The Harvard Bubble™.
Be sure to check out a few of these options before it’s too late — time really flies, and the Canada Goose jackets and sub-zero temperatures will soon be here before you know it.
