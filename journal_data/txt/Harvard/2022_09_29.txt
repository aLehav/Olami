After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scrolling through popular fashion resale sites such as Poshmark, Depop, the Vestiaire Collective, or the RealReal, it’s easy to see the grip that classic luxury brands have on the secondhand marketplace. Gucci and Ralph Lauren are constantly trending on Poshmark, and Chanel is one of the most-searched brands on Depop. In recent years, luxury resale, or the sale of pre-owned luxury items, has become increasingly popular online. The secondhand market offers consumers a way to purchase coveted brands at a discounted price while also providing a more sustainable pathway to consumption. The resulting demand is tremendous — the global market for luxury resale was valued at $32.6 billion in 2021. Luxury brands are unsure of how to react to this growing market, but they are increasingly revealing what they’ll do to preserve their prestigious names.
Second-hand and consignment stores have long been a place to find cheap, quality goods. Yet recently, the idea of “thrifting” has been co-opted by online influencers who promote an eco-friendly and stylish image. They “greenwash” their purchases by advertising their sustainability and ignoring the acceleration of shifting style trends and worship of luxury goods. These new buyers with high-end tastes have dominated not only luxury-specific stores but also general thrifting marketplaces like Depop, eBay, and Poshmark. Expensive new products in the marketplace have piled onto rapidly rising prices, so that the people most in need of low prices suffer the most.
The enormous resale market has also posed a question: How do historically exclusive brands maintain an air of prestige when products are more affordable on the resale marketplace? It’s a concern that’s been difficult to address. Third-party sellers give luxury brands very little control over who is buying their products. Additionally, authenticating resold items has long been a challenging process. Companies are worried about resale sites because they both change the client base and they allow inauthentic products to circulate and sow public distrust in the brand.
The prevalence of falsely labeled goods was such an alarming concern that in 2020, Chanel sued the popular site The RealReal for selling counterfeit pieces falsely bearing the brand’s label. The luxury giant claimed that The RealReal was guilty of counterfeit, trademark infringement, and false advertising, amongst other charges. The RealReal maintained that its authentication process was rigorous, yet Chanel explicitly mentioned in its complaint that it wanted not only to end counterfeits but also “to maintain the prestige of its brand.” The RealReal tried to counter the suit, but ultimately the company doled out $11.5 million in a settlement. Chanel might have directly gone after the RealReal’s authentication process, but the details of the case reveal the suit’s larger purpose: keeping the brand away from a non-luxurious second-hand marketplace which could damage its prestigious reputation.
Although Chanel showed its apparent distrust for the authenticity of resale markets, it invested in another consignment site called FarFetch while pursuing its lawsuit against The RealReal. The brand chose this site since it has higher prices and creates a barrier of exclusivity that The RealReal aims to eliminate. Since it's clear that luxury resale sites won’t disappear, classic brands have started to work with them on their own terms. This new strategy allows famous companies to maintain control over their credibility and prestige and also project a false image of sustainability to the public.
The real problem in this circular marketplace isn’t the resale sites, which attempt to pair sustainability with the demands of the market, but instead the brands that are trying to maintain their exclusive names. The fervor that these companies generate around their work is what causes thrift store prices to rise, luxury resale sites to fake their labels, and consumers to spend exorbitant amounts of money on overpriced goods.
Despite brands’ concern about the reliability of luxury resale sites, it seems like their popularity will only grow — the industry is projected to hit $51 billion by 2023. The scandals surrounding resale sites have not deterred most consumers, and if anything the partnerships resulting from some brands’ concerns have encouraged the continued adoration of luxury products. Consumers continue to clamor for the goods of giant corporations, unable to see that companies would strongly prefer to make their goods exclusive and unsustainable. It is only if people abandon the worship of these brands, which are more interested in their prestige than sustainability, that the luxury resale market will lose its immense popularity. Unfortunately, a decrease in demand does not appear to be anywhere in sight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am always overwhelmed at diners. Brunch is simply confusing. It’s marketed as one meal, but really, we are asked whether we would like breakfast or lunch. I am generally partial toward the latter, but an enticing picture of pancakes or an omelet can persuade me in the other direction. While it is unjust to make anyone pick between the sandwich and soup combo and French toast, the fact of such an overwhelming array of options imbues one’s decision with an air of importance.
Hopefully, Harvard students feel similarly when looking through the course catalog. With the immense amount of human knowledge available on the shelves of Widener, and typically only 32 courses for the most intelligent people on the planet to explain the contents to us, we must all struggle in choosing whether to familiarize ourselves with the greatest works of the opera or the operations of the Cosmos. When we select a class, we sacrifice at least 10 other classes we could’ve taken that we will never take. An Economics concentrator would call this an opportunity cost. Initially, that missed opportunity propels us to take full advantage of the courses in which we enroll.
But during this choosing process, we become complacent. We desire to get good grades and have free time, so that the General Education course with a reading list of books we wanted to finish before graduation might not be given due attention. Even when we are motivated enough, by virtue of the opportunity cost, to savor the meal we picked or the class we took, that attitude does not extend to how we use our unassigned hours.
The beginning of the summer promises no end. The sun will always be up at eight o’clock, and it seems the weather will never grow cold. After closing our final examination blue book, it feels as though we will never have to open one again. Unlike during the academic year, in which we must prioritize certain activities, there is no sacrifice to be made — we have ample time for everything. So, what is the harm in conking out, cracking open the laptop, and watching an episode — or maybe a season, or a whole series — on Netflix?
I am quite familiar with this lackadaisical urge. (I should qualify that relaxation is not necessarily bad, we must give ourselves breaks to empower ourselves for other things, and leisure of the Aristotelian variety is certainly no problem.) Yet there is one philosophical concept popularized on the internet in 2012 which frequently corrects my errors: You Only Live Once (YOLO).
Advocates of YOLO contend that we should value our time because we can’t gain more of it. The concept itself is excellent, but its execution leaves much to be desired. Youths in 2012 used YOLO as an excuse for carelessness as opposed to an imperative for consideration and deliberation. Perhaps a better model for YOLO is not the 21st-century variety, but rather one based on severe concern for each moment of time — something that is, at its core, a deeply Jewish idea.
As Jews, we believe each moment can be made holy through following Halacha, or Jewish law, and fulfilling mitzvot, or commandments. When I began to observe these rules more strictly, I was overwhelmed and scared by how much was demanded of my time. Each moment was to be important, and contained in it an opportunity to do something of monumental significance. How could I live up to that?
The first change I made in my life toward adopting Jewish practice was saying “Modeh Ani” — “I offer thanks” — in the morning at the moment I woke up. This demonstrated to me that each time I woke up it was with a purpose — that God specifically chose for me to wake up so I could do something good that day. As my practice developed, this notion only became more salient, and it began to reflect not just in the religious rituals I performed, but in every aspect of my life.
I started developing an inner dialogue when I’d commence an activity: “Is this thing worthwhile? You could be visiting the sick, learning Torah, or helping another with his load.” I could respond to myself in several ways: “No, it’s not,” “Well, it is essential that I do this so that I can do those things later on,” “It is, because it increases my empathy and love of fellow people.” Unfortunately, this dialogue is not omnipresent in my consciousness; it has just begun its growth. Nevertheless, it has assured me that we all have a radical ability to always improve ourselves and the world, so whenever we commit ourselves to something, we must ask why it is valuable and if we are seriously dedicated to gleaning what it has to offer.
Prioritizing each moment is not a call to spend all of one’s time laboring or being “economically productive” — that is far from the Jewish ideal which upholds the importance of the Sabbath. Rather, this should be interpreted as an urge to value each moment and dedicate them accordingly, whether through bonding with friends, studying the great thinkers of the past, or planting a garden. We even contribute to our improvement when we avoid doing things like stealing, speaking poorly of someone else, or cheating on a test. Without being overly prescriptive or proscriptive, it is still possible and necessary to determine how our time is spent.

I’m drafting this piece on my phone as I lie in bed, straining to see against the rising sun’s glare. This place has amazing strawberry pancake wraps, but still, a stay in a psych ward is not the vacation I was hoping for.
That is to say, following years of depression, I tried to take my life after arriving on campus this semester. Now I’m on a medical leave of absence to recover and figure out what comes next.
I’m not pretending that I’m raising awareness about an issue no one knows about, that I’m the only one who’s experienced suicidal ideation. In fact, most of Harvard’s student body is already painfully aware, given that about 1,100 suicides occur on US college campuses each year, as many as one in three college students have depression, even more have an anxiety disorder, and, according to a 2013 study, 65 percent know someone who has either attempted or died by suicide. So I’m here to speak for myself, with the understanding that no one is alone in experiencing the impact of suicidal ideation, that my story is nothing more or less than my own.
And I am here to speak, because contrary to myth, talking about suicide does not increase the risk that others will consider it — it’s the opposite, if anything. I’m here to speak because my alternative is to be silent, and during Suicide Prevention Awareness Month at that. I won’t minimize how uncomfortable and difficult the topic is, but I hope this piece can contribute to unraveling the secrecy and fear around suicide that muffle discussion and prevent people from reaching out to get help, a systemic secrecy and fear that won’t stop at me or anyone else.
It was when my depression worsened this summer that I decided to write this column. I didn’t want to see the future. I didn’t want to continue to try. I didn’t want to die, in itself, but I wanted to stop feeling this chronic mental pain, this immobilizing sadness that exists for no reason save for the fact that I’m depressed, this heavy tightness in my chest that foreshadows an onslaught of intrusive thoughts. For me, suicidal ideation is wanting time to stop, to leave my changing life behind, to escape the cycle of existential and truly physical exhaustion that restarts at every sunrise.
But I’m still here, and I’m still depressed. And I’m going to figure out where I’m going.
“I’m fine,” is what I used to say when anyone asked me how I was doing. That was the easy answer, but not an accurate one. “I’m fine” could mean anything from “This is the best day of my life” to “I want to sleep and never wake up.” It was the easy answer, because I was ashamed and afraid of my thoughts. I blamed myself for them, and repression was easier than acknowledgment. I thought I could overcome them. I thought I was strong enough. Am I strong? That’s a separate question, and one that feeds into the stigma around suicide; because just as anyone’s bones can break, mental illness has nothing to do with strength.
It’s hard to fully describe my personal experience of suicidal depression. The nights followed by nights, the days followed by days. The days of physically moving in slow motion, watching as unfinished assignments piled up, staring at the wall because there was absolutely nothing I wanted to do, sleeping. Sleeping — most of my free time, every day, not because I was tired, but because I could escape my pain and the question of “What now?”. At the start of this semester, I often physically couldn’t pull myself out of bed to go eat in the dining hall unless a friend invited me or came to knock on my suite’s door.
I owe my friends more than I have the word count to express. It was opening up about my depression and suicidal feelings to a few people this year that most helped me to accept myself (though I also should’ve looked into therapy much sooner). “I’m fine” became “I’m okay” or “I’m not doing very well,” and “I’m good” meant exactly that. People knew the truth about how mentally ill I was, and it was okay. Some of my friends had similar experiences, and some didn’t. But the simple act of externalizing my emotions, of removing the Harvard-certified smile of effortless perfection, of showing to myself that I wasn’t faking my pain, made me realize: Through the days of feeling worthless, the nights of hoping to not wake up, I was the same person who my friends knew, who I knew. Despite everything, it was still me. And it still is.
So, what now? I’ll live until tomorrow morning. Life will change, day by day, and we’ll change with it. And in that, we’ll never be alone.
I’m suicidal, and while I’m not yet glad that I’m still here, I want to live, to live and learn. I’m already doing slightly better, in a gradual process of recovery and healing after getting help. Yet I still can’t fully restart the flow of time in my detached perspective of the world. It’s not my fault, or because I’m broken or weak, or however else internalized stigma has led me to criticize myself. I don’t disparage myself for my physical disability, and I won’t disparage myself for my mental illness either. I’ll change, recover, and move on from this endless, cycling present, accepting all of myself as I am.
One more day.
And once I do, I hope to smile. Not a smile of perfection that masks who I am in secrecy and fear, but a smile that says, “The sun is rising over my bed again, and morning is starting without me, and I’m not fine; but though the pain remains, and though it may be hard, I’ll carry on.”
One more day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While participating in the Summer Research Opportunities at Harvard program this summer, 22 undergraduate students from outside institutions discovered that Boston, the consummate wintry city, is getting hot.
This past summer was one of Boston’s hottest on record, and our guests felt it. Sweltering heat drove some SROH participants to sleep in labs or common spaces instead of their own beds. When mentors requested portable air conditioning to help with the heat, students received only box fans after nearly a week’s delay.
The heat became dangerous on a bus trip to a late-July conference in Hartford, Conn. Over the course of the trip, a series of administrative missteps forced students to change buses twice, including to a vehicle without AC or openable windows. One student suffered heat stroke that ended in hospitalization. Participants described the trip as chaotic and “actively unsafe.”
The prolonged, dangerous heat faced by the SROH participants was egregious and clearly unacceptable. Simple communication and low-effort, proactive interventions could have easily averted these crises. Harvard failed spectacularly to put its best foot forward as a host to visiting students — guests of our institution.
To the Editorial Board, the SROH participants’ summer nightmare furnishes a strong argument for providing us with AC. We disagree.
Harvard undergraduates do not suffer extreme heat to an extent remotely comparable to those who participated in SROH. This summer’s SROH students were on campus from June to August, the peak of Cambridge’s heat. Undergraduate students at Harvard, by contrast, generally move in during late August, experiencing a month-by-month slide into the characteristic chills of Cantabrigian winter. To equate the highly unpleasant and sometimes-dangerous conditions suffered for months by our summer visitors with the brief, moderate discomfort of a Massachusetts summer’s dying days is to make a wildfire out of a candle’s flame.
Last semester, after a certain interloping YouTuber disrupted an LS1B lecture, the Editorial Board wrote, jokingly, that “We came to Harvard hoping to be walled off from the world, the vagaries of day-to-day life dashed against the wrought-iron gates of Harvard Yard. Instead, we were inconvenienced.”
With today’s editorial, the Board seems to have missed the punchline. As a long, important train of our precedents emphasizes, student well-being matters deeply and merits firm institutional support across a host of issues far more serious than a few sweltering evenings. But Harvard neither can nor should be a palace. Manageable, non-life-threatening adversity is an entirely reasonable burden to expect us to bear.
Most of our lives will be spent beyond Cambridge, without the protection of a multi-billion-dollar behemoth squelching our every discomfort like an impudent bug. With that in mind, we would venture to say that managing the annoyance of a few weeks of mild heat can even be educational. Able-bodied Harvard students can learn to “brave” the mild heat of late August and early September by cracking open a window, plugging in a fan, chugging some water, or daring to sleep above the covers — simple remedies for this minor inconvenience.
On a more serious note, we recognize that heat is a more serious problem for some, and we believe that anyone who requires an accessibility accommodation to combat the heat should get one. As we have discussed previously, Harvard’s Disability Access Office (formerly known as the Accessible Education Office) lacks the resources to alleviate the difficulties faced by students. This ineffectiveness is disappointing and has long demanded remedy, but we can do better in addressing case-by-case issues without retrofitting every dorm room on campus with AC.
Ironically, that retrofitting would exacerbate the global warming driving Boston’s record temperatures in the first place. Simply put, AC is a climate catastrophe, both in terms of energy use and of the refrigerants it needs to function. Rich though it may be, Harvard runs into important tradeoffs when it makes decisions on spending. Rather than wasting time and money slapping climate-killing AC units onto our dorm, Harvard should invest in the kind of ambitious climate research and mitigation that Boston desperately needs.
A few weeks of restless nights and sweat-stained days has the power to preserve our community’s natural environment for generations to come. To achieve this, we can take the heat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First impressions matter. To varying degrees, our first impressions of, well, everything, shape the ways we choose to engage — or not engage — going forward. For some of the students affiliated with the Summer Research Opportunities at Harvard program this past summer, their first impressions of Harvard were likely quite poor — and rightfully so.
This past summer, Boston faced a record-breaking extended heat wave. SROH students, living in a Harvard dorm with no air conditioning or box fans at first, were left to beat the heat themselves. With reportedly little support or communication at all from Harvard, some students “left their doors open, stayed awake late into the night, or slept in labs, hallways, and house common spaces, according to four program affiliates,” leaving them in a “steady state of exhaustion.” Worse still, some SROH students had to confront more than just the heat wave and lack of communication from administrators — one student reported dealing with multiple instances of breaking and entering, and another student suffered a heat stroke on the bus to a program conference in Hartford, Connecticut.
It's safe to say none of this should have happened, given the prestige and wealth of our institution, logically or ethically speaking. An increase in the summer heat was foreseen; it could and should have been planned for. Students were here to do valuable research and contribute ground-breaking knowledge, and Harvard should have ensured to the best of its ability — an admittedly high bar — that they were able to focus on scholarship. As a Board, and given the several, significant complaints, we don’t believe that the Harvard administration in fact did so.
Harvard’s lack of measures to mitigate excessive heat is not new: None of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate houses have central air conditioning, and window AC units are available only to students with registered Disability Access Office accommodations. Extreme heat can have serious health consequences even for those without preexisting health conditions — and worse consequences for those who do. Considering the current climate crisis and its predictably unfortunate future trajectory, the University must promptly address the issue on campus. The necessary reforms are varied in nature, including, but not limited to, installing AC units, adding more water refilling stations, and incrementally modernizing undergraduate houses. Similarly, Harvard should allow students to purchase their own MicroFridge units to cope with extreme heat. Currently, MicroFridges can only be rented every academic year through the infamous, student-run monopoly known as Harvard Student Agencies, whose units are not only cost-inefficient but often insufficient to satisfy campus demand.
On a bigger scale, the climate crisis reinforces pre-existing inequalities. The Harvard bubble, although quite good at making us sometimes forget that there is a Cambridge (an entire world even) beyond Harvard, is not exempt from these issues. In the absence of administrative support, students with access to documentation necessary for receiving DAO accommodations, or the resources to afford air conditioning and other means to combat extreme weather conditions, will likely not be the ones to suffer. Instead, those lacking access to resources will bear the brunt of the heat, adding to an already extensive list of the harmful consequences that already socioeconomically disadvantaged students will have to bear as the global climate crisis ravages Harvard’s campus.
To be clear, we don’t believe that access to air conditioning is a fundamental human right of sorts, being irresponsibly ignored by administrators. However, Harvard has been frequently willing to mobilize its immense wealth for campus fixtures we didn’t ask for — like the ludicrously expensive Luxembourg Chairs that populate the Yard. Thus, we don’t find requests for the University to provide AC units or more water refilling stations to be unreasonable. If the University insists on curating an AC-less undergraduate housing experience, then it should at least keep cool public spaces on campus open for longer — spaces like our multiple libraries, the Science Center, or the Smith Campus Center which have central air conditioning.
We don’t expect Harvard to singlehandedly solve the climate crisis and the increasingly sweltering Cambridge, but in the long term, the University should use its resources to address the direct toll of climate change on campus and beyond. More green spaces, such as shade-giving trees on campus and more trees along the river, would help with the heat and also rising water levels, amid other environmental challenges posed by climate change, even if they would have been scant help to the SROH visitors. Harvard must also increase its investment in clean energy capacity to reduce its carbon footprint. A world-class institution for higher education and knowledge, Harvard must model ideal behavior by further committing to investing in research that aims to combat and mitigate the effects of climate change.
We know that not having air conditioning in our dorms is not the end of the world — but the climate crisis could just be. For everyone’s sake: Harvard, please help turn down the temperature, at Cambridge and beyond.

This summer, Amy E. Chalán Vacacela ’24 opened the course catalog and clicked straight to the Ethnicity, Migration, Rights offerings. When EMR 151: “Quechua, Indigenous language revitalization and Global Indigeneity” popped up, she recalls, “It was so perfect.”
Chalán is Kichwa from the Saraguro tribe in Ecuador. She is one of nearly 10 million people around the world who speak a dialect of Quechua, the Indigenous language group of the Andes Mountains in South America. Diasporic Quechua-speaking communities like Chalán’s in New York are growing rapidly across the United States. Though Quechua is not as critically endangered as other Indigenous languages, its native speaker base has declined, in part because many associate the language — once spoken in the Inca Empire — with the past.
Professor Américo Mendoza-Mori, a Peruvian scholar of Indigenous language and culture, designed EMR 151 to address that misconception. The course studies contemporary Indigenous issues, from climate change and sovereignty to the complexities of Indigenous identity and its intersections with Latinidad. Although students only learn elementary Quechua, the course examines language as a tool to access Indigenous cultures, traditions of knowledge, and expressions of self.
“The incorporation of philosophies and definitions in Indigenous languages into academia or into global conversations can help make more visible [Indigenous] contributions or those perspectives,” Mendoza-Mori says.
For example, EMR 151 recently discussed the Quechua term sumak kawsay. “It has been a philosophical term to propose, let’s say, harmony with the environment through collaboration,” Mendoza-Mori says. “In the contemporary world, that perspective helps us reflect on, for example, other traditions that put more emphasis on the individual.”
To enrich the study of these terms and epistemologies, Mendoza-Mori invited Quechua guest speakers, including Nely Huayta, a Quecha linguist; Soledad Secca, a TikTok creator; and Diego Tituaña, a Kichwa diplomat who formerly represented Ecuador in the United Nations. Contrary to the course’s title, which suggests Quechua’s decline, these guests serve as testimony to the current vitality of the global Quechua community.
By incorporating diverse Quechua voices into the course, Mendoza-Mori is also addressing a controversy around the use of the term “revitalization” to describe Indigenous language studies.
Revitalization “has been the scholarly term to refer to initiatives that are trying to make sure that endangered languages don’t die, or that they actually expand,” he says. But from the beginning of the course, Mendoza-Mori and his students have discussed why the term may not accurately portray this class.
“I chose this name because that’s what people might associate with these processes — they go to the term ‘language revitalization,’” Mendoza-Mori says. “At the same time, what do we do with that term in the case of Quechua? Quechua has 10 million speakers. The language is already alive.”
Not only does the idea of “language revitalization” often misrepresent the state of Indigenous languages, it misplaces the responsibility of teaching them in the hands of universities, according to professor Davíd Carrasco.
“The only people who can ‘revitalize’ a language would be the native language speakers themselves, who know the language in its depths and length,” Carrasco, a historian at the Divinity School and director of the Moses Mesoamerican Archive and Research Project, wrote in an email. “Harvard is not going to ‘revitalize’ indigenous languages but rather study, learn, and perhaps provide some resources to study and learn.”
According to Mendoza-Mori, scholars of Indigenous languages are pushing to use the term “language reclamation” instead. “Language reclamation acknowledges that this process is more of a larger effort by a community to claim its right to speak a language and to set associated goals in response to its community’s needs,” he says.
Rebecca Mendoza Nunziato, an Xicana graduate student at the Divinity School, has herself worked to incorporate Indigenous language into academic spaces under Carrasco’s guidance. In 2021, she co-founded the Mesoamerican Cultural Table to study Nahuatl, a Uto-Aztecan Mexican Indigenous language, with other Indigenous students and interested community members.
But language study is only a step toward acknowledging the colonial legacy that has kept Indigenous studies from its rightful place in academia, says Mendoza-Mori; once established at universities, the curricula must empower Indigenous communities in “more concrete terms” of “liberation.”
Mendoza Nunziato is looking to expand the Mesoamerican Cultural Table, a shift she says requires reframing ideas of knowledge, self, and community from Western to Indigenous knowledge systems.
“By learning not only grammar, but even individual words or phrases, we gained access to a completely different way of being and becoming,” Mendoza Nunziato says. The members of the Mesoamerican Cultural Table also learn through ceremony, art, and food. ”
To Mendoza Nunziato, classrooms like Mendoza-Mori’s put learning into practice. She visited one of his classes as a guest speaker, and recalls, “it felt like home.”
“Those spaces don’t happen on accident,” she says. “The University can continue to invest in that because the student body is changing, and the things we want to learn and how we want to learn them [are] changing.”
When Chalán first arrived at Harvard as a freshman, she took math and science classes toward a degree in biomedical engineering but quickly realized that her passion lay in ethnic studies. She now studies Indigeneity as a Social Studies concentrator.
Although Mendoza-Mori’s course will not count toward her concentration, she still describes it as “another step of this really impactful journey.”
“It’s just been able to really inform my sense of self and affirm that I am Indigenous, and I’ve not always felt that way,” she says. “It’s not always been easy to feel proud of being Indigenous.”
But expanded course offerings are only the beginning of building inclusivity for Indigenous students at Harvard; according to Chalán, the university must build “a decolonial and safe space” that equally values Indigenous knowledge systems.
Mendoza Nunziato agrees that Indigenous inclusion goes far beyond a syllabus. “We need to have people at the table,” she says, in order to “see beyond the scarcity that we’re taught to experience as marginalized people.”
Ultimately, Mendoza-Mori views these efforts to expand Indigenous language and cultural studies as an opportunity to shift power from Western spaces in American higher education.
“Institutions are accepting more diverse student bodies because the population is changing,” he says. “But at the same time, institutions should let themselves be transformed by that.”
Correction: October 7, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Rebecca Mendoza Nunziato co-founded the Mesoamerican Cultural Table in 2020. In fact, she co-founded the group in 2021.

When the first draft of the human genome was sequenced in 2003, it cost nearly $3 billion. Today, a human genome can be sequenced for just a couple hundred dollars. On Tuesday, Sept. 20, Harvard Medical School hosted its annual Precision Medicine Symposium, which focused on the ethical development and deployment of genetic screening to predict people’s risk of developing various diseases.
During an afternoon session, panelists described that by comparing the genomes of large groups of patients with and without a particular disease, scientists can develop models used to calculate an individual’s so-called polygenic risk score — their relative chance of developing common diseases based on a holistic read of their genome. These risk scores can be combined with information about an individual’s lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, or smoking to enhance their predictive value. The hope is that polygenic risk scores will allow doctors and patients to then prevent, mitigate, or prepare early for illness.
Right now, however, genetic screening in clinical settings is largely reserved for patients who actively seek it out, such as in the case of screening for rare diseases among expectant parents. But some scientists, clinicians, and companies are pushing for the widespread use of these tests, say, for common disease. For example, companies like 23andMe offer direct consumer genetic testing for people to explore their effects of their ancestry on disease risk.
But before scientists scale the research and technology, panelists at the conference underscored the need for more diverse datasets to ensure that risk scores are applicable to all kinds of people.
“I see the single greatest limitation in genetics for precision medicine for common diseases as the fact that our datasets are so vastly Eurocentric,” says panelist Alicia R. Martin, a scientist at the Broad Institute.
The largest and most commonly used dataset is the UK Biobank, which includes half a million people, most of whom are white, explained panelist Carlos D. Bustamante, a professor of biomedical data science at Stanford University. When risk scores are calculated from Eurocentric datasets, they come with inherent limitations. Applying these models to non-European patients can compound health disparities due to their inaccuracies.
“There’s a different type of urgency because [polygenic risk scores] are being proposed to be applied to very large swaths of the population,” says Arjun R. Manrai, assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School and organizer of the conference. “They're being trained and built for very common conditions, things like Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and obesity.”
Yet, diversifying datasets will require reshaping genetic studies at every step, from creative recruitment strategies to standardizing analyses. And Martin and Bustamante both know the challenges of this process firsthand.
Martin leads studies which look for genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, psychosis, and bipolar disorder in African populations. She notes that it’s taken her team seven years to collect 40,000 samples. In addition to confronting technical hurdles such as protocol standardization and ethics committee reviews, researchers have faced deep mistrust from patients.
Bustamante is part of a team building a project called Biobank of the Americas. They hope to compile data from 10 million people by collecting their Covid tests. Since the pandemic has affected people across all the “nooks and crannies of the healthcare system,” their patient sample is more diverse — he says that about 70 percent of people have had no problem with researchers keeping their Covid sample.
“We unfortunately don't have as much money as either 23andMe or the UK Government or the NIH,” Bustamante says. “We’ve just got some freezers in Miami.”
Though they lack large-scale funding, Bustamante is excited about their grassroots approach to collecting genetic material. The same strategy could be expanded to taking samples from blood banks and bone marrow registries, he says.
Stella Aslibekyan, a genetic epidemiologist at 23AndMe, says that in terms of raw numbers, 23AndMe has large samples of data from minority populations — but that percentage-wise, it’s still not representative of the broader population.
“Because we have 12 million people in absolute numbers, we actually have pretty big cohorts of African American individuals, of Latinx individuals, and of different individuals belonging to different ethnic groups,” Aslibekyan says. However, as a percentage, 75 percent of their population is still of European descent, revealing a gaping need for diversity if the goal is to overcome mistrust and set up inclusive research infrastructure.
“We have a lot of work to do in terms of reaching out and building trust with the communities that had historically been hurt by medical research, and specifically genetic research,” Aslibekyan says. In the meantime, she says that they have rigid criteria for releasing a polygenic risk score to consumers: “If it performs poorly in at least one ethnic group, we don’t release it at all, because we don’t want to perpetuate existing disparities that exist in that space.”
By the end of the discussion, all of the panelists concurred that despite increased interest in genetics research and improved financial accessibility, the field needs to see equal gains in diversity to reflect national or global representation.
While researchers work on expanding diversity, clinicians need to pay attention to how they communicate test results, says Aniruddh Patel, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Patel says he didn’t know what polygenic risk scores were when he graduated medical school in 2014 and hypothesizes that most primary care clinicians are not equipped to have robust conversations about these results.
Communicating the implications of risk scores is even more challenging in the absence of clear thresholds for health or disease status. The name of the conference — “The New Normal” — hints at this ambiguity: for example, should a patient with 30 percent risk of a cardiovascular condition be given the same advice as a patient with 80 percent risk?
While researchers may know scores come with caveats and could be imprecise, Patel explains that the bar is even higher in practice because “you’re actually practicing and giving recommendations that they apply to everybody.”

When I was 10 years old, I cornered my mother in the hallway and asked her if I was beautiful. My sister and I kept a stack of American Girl books in our room, meant to teach American girls how to love themselves, and it had recently dawned on me that I didn’t look like the preteen models in their pages.
Knowing I would learn this lesson one way or another, my mom pulled no punches. I was pretty enough, she said kindly, but not beautiful. and that was enough. In the long term, it didn’t matter.
Looking back, I think she was trying to save me, to break something important to me gently before the rest of the world got to me first. Growing up, she slowly and almost imperceptibly fed me stories about beauty failing to bring happiness. There was her aunt Ruti, gorgeous but unstable, who had ruined her marriage and chased her husband around the kitchen with a carving knife. There were models who ate cotton balls to feel full without gaining weight. There was my grandmother, a ’70s beauty queen who permanently shortened her Achilles tendons by dancing in high heels.
I listened to these stories for years without really believing in their message. In middle school, I started wearing lipstick, then concealer, then mascara — a new step in the routine for every additional flaw I picked out.
And 10 years later, reeling from my first big breakup and desperate to see somebody new in the mirror, I sat down in a wobbling salon chair and asked the hairdresser to make me platinum blond.
***
When I told my colorist I was bleaching my entire head for the first time because of a boy, she made me promise I wouldn’t hate her if I immediately regretted my decision.
Going from dark brown to platinum is no joke. Dark, “virgin” hair usually takes multiple sessions to safely turn blond, a process as uncomfortable and damaging as it is expensive. I didn’t even know if I would look halfway decent with my new color; I just wanted the old one gone.
Eight hours, several hundred dollars, and one bleach-burned scalp later, I walked out of the salon with a head of platinum-blond hair. Stepping into the late-spring wind, I felt iridescent, modelesque, reborn. I posted about it on Instagram, jubilantly inaugurating the new me. And I was new, in ways I hadn’t anticipated.
As a brunette, I’d felt anonymous, forgettable, ordinary. I never expected new acquaintances to remember me on a second meeting; I went to parties and felt immune to male attention, wanted and unwanted alike; I flew under the radar. With my newly glowing head, I could suddenly take up space. I felt men watching me at bars and clubs — not many, not always, but enough to feel triumphant and desired. At a Phoebe Bridgers concert, a tipsy girl walked by me, grabbed a fistful of my hair, and yanked, delighting in my blondness. When old friends told me they hadn’t recognized me at first, I grinned; that was exactly what I wanted.
Strangely (or maybe not so strangely), blondness seems to correlate with female power; almost half of female CEOs and over a third of female senators have bleached hair. When I went blond, though, I wasn’t aiming for power; I was aiming for hotness. I was putting on a performance, sending out a signal. It didn’t matter if my almost-silver hair looked natural (it doesn’t). Nobody had to believe it was real. All that mattered was that I had deliberately donned the costume, and all the associations that came with it: friendly, fun, vain, carefree, frivolous, stupid, pretty. I needed to demonstrate availability, attractiveness, complete concession to beauty standards. Going blond sent the message loud and clear.
***
Any woman who’s spent five minutes on the internet has probably heard (or even said herself) that all these little signals, all these beauty rituals and body modifications and attempts to achieve visual perfection, are just for us. In the 21st century, any choices we make about our own bodies and appearances must at least be morally neutral, if not uplifting.
“Feminism is about being in control of your life — which includes your body, your decisions and your face,” announces the author of a pro-makeup Glamour article aptly filed under “Empowerment.” Twenty-step skincare routines to achieve the “clean girl” look are the norm. In an interview with Healthline, one plastic surgeon benevolently explains that patients today are “much more comfortable owning their self-care rituals” — invasive, body-altering surgery, of course, being the ritual in question. In fact, you could be forgiven for assuming that “self-care” just means changing your body into something worth caring for. Plastic surgery has always been a women’s game, but it’s becoming more popular than ever among girls too young to even know what their faces will look like when they’re done developing.
I could have been one of them. Two of my cousins got nose jobs before they turned 18, primed by a lifetime of cutting comments from my grandmother. When I zip myself into a suffocating party dress, I understand the allure of acting like I do it for fun. Suffering for beauty is a universal truth of female existence — an adage passed down to me by my mother when she taught me to tweeze my own eyebrows — but it’s also deeply embarrassing, this feeling of tormenting ourselves for an apathetic audience.
Going back to the salon every six weeks to cover up my roots did carry the veneer of self-care at first. I told my mom I loved the enforced downtime, the three-hour block in which I could accomplish absolutely nothing but stare at my reflection and wait for the stinging bleach paste to lift out my pigment. But more than a year later, those appointments feel more like an obligation than a carefree break from reality. Like a pack-a-day smoker, I’ve gradually realized I might not be able to quit whenever I want.
***
As Instagram and TikTok have taught me, there are infinitely many surgeries and injections I could undergo to “fix” my face. Instead, I’ve given my yearning 10-year-old self the next best thing: the blond version of me, calculated to be maximally attractive, something people want and then miss. In some sense, it worked. A quick glance at the hellscape of my Hinge messages confirms the common wisdom that many guys definitely have a thing for blondes. It’s not all good, of course. I’ve gotten accustomed to catcalls and uncomfortable come-ons, and worse — the sinking, humiliating sense that I’ve asked for it somehow, that I sent the right signal to the wrong person.
When my friends ask how long I’ll stay blond, I like to say I’m keeping it forever, or at least until I find a husband. It’s the same twinge I get when I see TikTok comment sections full of girls who can’t wait to feel comfortable in their own skin after a round of lip injections or rhinoplasty or a boob job. What we want more than anything is self-love; what we do is self-effacement. Bleaching my hair brought me closer than I’d ever been to feeling beautiful — and when you get so close, it’s impossible not to want more. The summer after I went blond, I attacked the project of self-improvement with newfound zeal: straightening my hair, fixing my skincare routine, finally learning how to use eyeliner. I got closer to perfect; I was always just one step away.
At 10 years old, I knew my mother’s answer to my searching question — pretty enough, not beautiful — wasn’t supposed to matter. But that night, in the room I shared with my sister, I cried. That girl anxiously redoing her hair before the sixth-grade dance — would she recognize me now?

It’s the first day of college. A gaggle of freshmen gathers in the middle of Harvard Yard. A professional-grade Bose speaker is blasting “Magic in the Hamptons” on repeat. Over the noise, people are yelling the classic freshman icebreakers, “WHAT’S YOUR MAJ— I MEAN, CONCENTRATION?” “WHERE IN NEW YORK ARE YOU FROM?” “WHAT’S YOUR MOST TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD MEMORY?” Just before the ambulance pulls up, the token triple-legacy asks, “Jefe’s or Felipe’s?”
El Jefe’s Taqueria — usually referred to as “Jefe’s” — is every student’s go-to spot after a long night of partying or psetting thanks to its ungodly late hours of operation.
This year, however, Jefe’s has changed locations from its fixture next to “Tasty Basty,” a freshman favorite party spot, to a much larger space across from CVS — the only business in Harvard Square that stays open longer than the burrito joint itself.
Part of the charm of Jefe’s old location was its impossibly long line moving an inch per hour, which filled in for Harvard’s otherwise lackluster social scene. Nothing tops off a Friday night better than making friends with the random kid in your section standing in front of you. Now, it remains to be seen if the tradition can continue in the larger, multi-story space.
After learning of Old Jefe’s fate, the Harvard community came together to hold a funeral at Cambridge’s Old Burying Ground for the beloved location.
The details of the interment were shared only by word of mouth — and in true Harvard fashion, via a printed invitation slipped under the doors of a select few. People from all walks of life attended: drunk teenagers, exhausted students, and Harvard alums desperate to feel young again. They came to express gratitude, remorse, and extremely explicit stories. Jamie J. Dunster ’99, who clarified multiple times that she was in Lowell House, made the first eulogy, sharing, “I’ve gone through so much in Jefe’s. I had my first hookup, my first breakup, and my last burrito there. It holds a special place in my heart.”
Meanwhile, Christian F. Vanderbilt ’24 explained that Jefe’s was his only social outlet at Harvard. “Every night during the weekends, I’d walk up to clearly inebriated students and ask them if they knew who Crimson Confessions was. And I figured it out. I am watching you,” he warns.
Others admitted to the crimes against humanity they committed at the restaurant. Ronald “Ron” Chee ’25, Trey M. Tinkle ’24, and Robert J. Head ’23 apologized for the trauma that they caused the Jefe’s toilet, eventually disinfecting and framing the toilet seat to memorialize its “strength through adversity.”
At the break of dawn, the service closed with a ceremonial burial of the last burrito made in the old Jefe’s building. As the burrito was lowered into the Earth, tears flowed freely.
Jefe’s was every student’s home away from home away from home. Though the restaurant may come back in different forms, its original location will always be with us: in our hearts, minds, and stomachs.

Diana L. Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies, served as Lowell’s Faculty Dean alongside her wife Dorothy A. Austin for 20 years. She currently resides right off a busy Cambridge intersection, in a cozy two-story home brimming with books and her two roaming cats. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: You last spoke to FM in 2011. What are some of the biggest shifts you’ve seen in religious diversity around you since then? 
DLE: If I’m looking at the wider United States, I think religious diversity has just continued to grow. And I think that’s probably true at Harvard as well. At Harvard, we have a dynamic Islamic community, a Hindu community – it’s been a few years since I’ve hosted Diwali at the Faculty Deans’ residence at Lowell House, but it was always hugely attended: piles of shoes at the front door and at the back door, and no furniture at all; the altar set up in the living room, fireplace, and everyone crowded in elbow to elbow.
It is not the godless Harvard that people used to speak of, in the old days. It’s one in which there is a lot of religious life and also just a lot of cultural life that is not particularly religious.
FM: You launched the Pluralism Project in 1991 to study the changing religious landscape in the United States. What has been the most fulfilling part of the project thus far?
DLE: The most rewarding part of this has been to look over the long haul and look at some of the challenges that have been developing in just about every aspect of American public life, whether it’s in hospitals, or city councils, or public schools, or colleges and universities, even corporations, where they have a much more religiously diverse clientele, student, body, citizenry, whatever, and need to think about policies and programs that are workable in this kind of environment. What we have done is to write case studies that are a bit like the ones they use at Harvard Business School. They have a protagonist — someone in the city council, or in the mayor’s office, or maybe the mayor himself — who needs to think about a new dilemma.
FM: Are there any interviews for these case studies you conducted that stand out to you? 
DLE: A lot of my writing is interview-based. In terms of the actual case studies, most of them have been written by my Senior Researcher, Elinor Pierce, who is brilliant, both as a researcher and also as a writer, and extremely careful and respectful of the people she talks to. She’s been a real boon.
FM: At Harvard, there have been tensions between students and some faith-based organizations because of accusations about discrimation and homophobia that is perpetuated or justified by religion. How would you suggest students approach these types of conversations?
DLE: Now, I fully admit that there are Christian perspectives that have been and still are condemnatory of homosexual practice. I think it is not only a problem because it is so exclusive, but I think it’s theologically wrong. There are a lot of Christian bodies, including the church I go to, that are explicitly welcoming of gay and lesbian people and whose theology is based not on judgment, but on justice and on love. People need a context in which to explore sexual identity and Christianity. It can be academic or personal, but it needs to go beyond simply complaining or accusations.
FM: How can we seek to understand other religions? 
DLE: There’s a bright thread running through most of them that really prioritizes relationship and love and human dignity and equality. It might be in relation to the diversity of religious traditions: is it important that my religion is true, exclusive of yours? What does it mean for religion to be true? Where does that truth reside? Is it somewhere in the sky? Or is it in the human heart?
FM: What role do these conversations about understanding other religions have on a college campus?
DLE: There are fairly robust interfaith communities where people actually get together and talk about tough issues. [At Harvard], the Interfaith Forum goes on year after year. You don’t have to wait for an enthusiastic group of students to reinvent it. That’s a pretty good sign. But there are a lot of people for whom going to something like that is not their cup of tea. The way in which they learn the most is their freshman roommates, their friend group. Diversity is sort of the life you live; it’s not necessarily something you go to.
FM: How would you describe how fully you have to engage with a different religion in a close relationship?
DLE: A close relationship with someone of a different religious or cultural tradition requires some knowledge, requires some work. Tolerance won’t take you very far when it comes to the tough issues of life. You need a mutual sense of how much family matters because it could be that the two of you are fine, but marriage isn’t simply something that has two people in it. Families get conjoined in weddings.
FM: How do you bridge these gaps from your own personal background and identity to working with people who are different?
DLE: I did grow up Christian. It was a church that really was based more on loving relationships and a real concern for social justice. So we did a lot of things that were very much part of working across what you might call cultural boundaries.
I decided to take this opportunity to do a junior year in India and went to Banaras Hindu University. It was a pretty big transition. I learned a huge amount there. And it was really that experience that drove me into the comparative study of religion.
FM: From Montana to India to Cambridge, what has been your favorite place to live?
DLE: I like them all. I love Montana. My mother died a few years ago, and I’ve had to deal with her home. I spent one week out there this summer with people I’ve known most of my life. There’s a lot that is grounded in that kind of place, where your roots are so very deep. But I don’t live there now. And I’m not likely to go back and live there.
FM: What do you miss most about living in Lowell? 
DLE: The Faculty Deans’ residence is connected just a few steps from the dining hall. I’m sort of a late-night person. I get a cup of coffee or cocoa or something late at night to see people working and have a chance just to talk for a few minutes. I liked the fact that I could deal with folks in the kitchen and servery staff, as well as the landscaping people because we had a nice little garden in the back, and I used to get down on my knees and plant things every springtime.
FM: In 2008, Lowell returned its bells to their original home in a Moscow monastery in exchange for a replica set. Could you tell me more about the bells’ return? 
DLE: We went up to the bell tower to see these famous bells, and then we realized that they were covered with icons, and it made sense that they were seen as national treasures in Russia.
It was really interesting going to Russia to visit foundries, trudging around different parts of Russia where they had started making bells again, and negotiating a deal. Then they [the Russians] came and made sort of pink rubber castings of all the decorative motifs on the bells. They rolled all of that up in their suitcases — we went out to Target with them and bought suitcases — took them back to Russia, and created a set of bells that had these same iconographic features. Eventually those bells were loaded on the ship and came to Boston.

FM: What is something that you feel you’ve learned through quarantine?
DLE: I’ve learned how important the human face is. Dorothy [my wife] has dementia, and it became a little more prominent. She used to be a really great lecturer and teacher and preacher at Memorial Church. Dorothy is someone who really responds to people who she can see, so every time we had only people she couldn’t see [due to masks] it was a little alienating.
FM: How is Dorothy now?
DLE: She was one of those ministers who just loved to stand at the door of the church and hug people as they went out. So all of that was lost, really. But she’s dealing with her life with a lot of dignity. And I think she realizes how much she’s lost — you can’t undergo this kind of diminishment of your ability to speak and to move about freely and whatnot, without some inner comprehension of that.
FM: You’re known to be a regular at Lowell’s Poemicals. What’s your favorite poem?
DLE: One of the Four Quartets of T.S. Eliot. It’s called “Little Gidding.”
FM: What is your favorite part about having cats?
DLE: I love their company. They are lap-sitting cats. When they sit on your lap and purr, it’s like nothing else in the world. I will reveal another personal story about this, which is that my least favorite thing about having cats is cleaning their litter box.

Following last year’s controversy, when three Porcellian Club punches were cut for posting their BeReals from inside the club, 14 of this year’s punches are attempting to unionize. Their demands include greater transparency on the punch calendar, improved communication on why punches get cut, and a stipend of $1,400 per month for dry cleaning.
Lead organizer Chase D. Winklevoss ’25 said, “You know, we see all these labor movements on TikTok, and we say to ourselves, we are being exploited just like them. I didn’t spend six years at Groton to do my own dry cleaning.”
His view is shared by many of his fellow PC punches, including Chad D. Winklevoss ’25. “When it comes down to it, we just aren’t willing to be exploited anymore,” he said. “That’s something we do to other people, and my father taught us never to let people treat us the way we treat them.”
The punches’ demands have largely been unacknowledged by the PC’s punch masters. In a statement to The Crimson, James D. Farley IV ’24 and Jack E. Whitehead VI ’23 wrote, “We both come from a long line of union-busting, and we will be damned if we besmirch our families’ names by letting some sophomores engage in collective bargaining. These kids don’t know the first thing about ‘worker power’ because most of them have never worked a day in their lives. It’s not like they are going to form a picket line.”
Ultimately, the fate of the unionization effort rests with the other 60 PC punches, a famously anti-labor crowd. One punch, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said, “On the one hand, I am tired of paying for my own dry cleaning. On the other hand, I am morally and philosophically opposed to any structure that would prevent exploitation, so I am really on the fence here.”
In an effort to sell the idea of a union to their fellow punches, Winklevoss added, “We have spoken with our lawyers, and we were sure to stipulate that the union would dissolve at the end of the calendar year — ensuring next year’s class won’t enjoy the same privileges. We would hate not to be able to screw next year’s kids the same way they’re screwing us.”
The results of the union vote are expected by the end of the month.

On April 9, 1969, hundreds of Harvard students took over University Hall to protest the Vietnam War. They forcibly ejected administrators from the building and locked the doors, refusing to budge until their demands were met. In response, Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 called in the police. Around 5 a.m. the next morning, nearly 400 officers stormed the hall, brandishing batons and tear gas in a bloody crackdown that fractured Harvard’s campus and shocked the nation.
The day went down in infamy as the highest-profile anti-war protest in Harvard history. But it wasn’t the first. In the weeks leading up to the University Hall takeover, students had rallied to banish Harvard’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, which they argued was fueling the war. Some even nailed a list of anti-war demands with a knife to the door of Pusey’s Quincy Street home.
In the annual presidential report Pusey had penned just months before, he wrote, “Perhaps, as some commentators suggest, we are moving through a turning point in history in which the old ways of doing things are breaking up.”
His grim prognosis was less a prediction than an inevitability. The nation was changing, and Harvard could no longer insulate itself from the political turmoil of the midcentury.
As the Vietnam War reached a fever pitch and the country grappled with the specter of McCarthyism, Pusey feared that Harvard was on the precipice of a dark age for American universities. “The ivory tower has become a laughably grotesque symbol of the contemporary institution of higher learning,” he wrote. “What do we do in such troubled circumstance as we are now experiencing?”
But Pusey resigned before he could arrive at an answer. He stepped down shortly after the takeover, partly driven by criticism he received for how he handled the unrest. He left the highest office of that troubled ivory tower in the hands of a very different man.
Derek C. Bok didn’t particularly want the Harvard presidency, nor did he think he was qualified for it. He was 40 years old and barely starting to make headway at Harvard Law School, where he’d become dean just two years prior. He didn’t boast an intricate vision for how to stitch a broken campus back together.
The morning his presidency was made public on Jan. 11, 1971, Bok said he did not foresee remaining in office as long as his predecessors had, given “the strains and difficulties of the job.”
“My own feeling,” he said as he reclined in a chair in the dean’s office, “is that it is really terribly important that you be as open as you can be about what you’re doing, be very careful about what you promise and that you break your back to fulfill an[y] commitments that you do make — and in that way very slowly build up trust in at least a substantial number of students and faculty.”
His presidency marked the beginning of two decades of transformation at Harvard — and in Bok’s own convictions about what Harvard was and could be. Over his 20 years in office, Bok witnessed five U.S. presidencies; he saw the Watergate scandal break, the Vietnam War end, and the Gulf War begin. He grappled with challenges no amount of planning could have fully prepared him for — the expansion of the Harvard Kennedy School, protests over the University’s investments in South Africa, and the battle over affirmative action.
“I’ve had a lot of people in my life come up to me — young people — and say, ‘How do you become a president?’” says Bok in July, his grin audible over the phone. “There is no way to become a president.”
Today, 50 years after Bok took office, another presidential search looms. Three months ago, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced his plans to step down in June 2023, precipitating a global hunt for Harvard’s 30th chief.
“It’s certainly very different from the time when I took office,” Bok, now 92, says. He insists that it is not his place to comment on the specifics of the ongoing search; today’s Harvard has its own leaders.
Yet many of the core predicaments Bok faced as he ascended to the top post are no more resolved today than they were in 1971. And as Harvard’s oldest living president, Bok can view Harvard’s current condition with a frame of reference few others possess.
For Bok, Harvard has been many things over his lifetime: a far-off goal, an alma mater, and, eventually, his home. But Harvard was also an ideal to aspire toward — one that was difficult yet, at its best, noble.
As president, Bok would shape the ideal of Harvard in ways that echo to this day. It, in turn, would shape him.
When Bok arrived on Stanford’s campus as a freshman in the late 1940s, the school, far from its current reputation as an aggressive innovator, was rather parochial. Footage from the time shows students lazing in hammocks and shuttling between classes against the backdrop of sloping Romanesque arches.
“Stanford was an entirely different place when I went there,” Bok says. “It was quite a sleepy institution.”
At Stanford, Bok majored in political science, in large part because its minimal requirements allowed him to venture into other disciplines. He was a self-described “mediocre” basketball player and a student government representative. He coordinated career advice panels with professors, urging his peers, according to a 1951 Stanford Daily article, to discover for themselves “why we pay $220 a semester to be at Stanford.”
His path from Palo Alto to Cambridge unfolded as a process of elimination. In his senior year, as the prospect of life after college loomed, Bok assessed his options. He knew he didn’t want to be a doctor. Nor did he want to be an engineer. Eventually, he resolved to try his hand at law. When he told his mother he intended to remain at Stanford, she pushed back, urging him to move beyond the familiarity of California.
There were few people at Stanford who had studied in the Northeast, so Bok decided to consult an adviser who’d attended graduate school at Harvard. His name was William H. Rehnquist, and he would go on to become the chief justice of the Supreme Court. He closed Bok’s case almost instantly.
“He didn’t even look up from his book,” Bok recalls. “He said, ‘Go to Harvard — you’ll never have to explain to anybody why you chose it.’”
So Bok sent in his application.
Upon arriving in Cambridge, one of the starkest differences Bok felt was in the rigor of the teaching. He was accustomed to pedagogy based on lectures, textbooks, and rote memorization. At Harvard Law School, which he calls “the great transformative experience” of his education, the expectations were wildly different.
“It was like using a muscle between my ears for the first time,” Bok says. “It kind of hurt. It was very slow going. But as time wore on, I found, you know, this has got to be doing a lot of good for me. I could feel myself changing.”
After class, the 1L would retire to his “cell-like” dorm in the newly erected Harkness Commons, poring over his notes to identify patterns and formulate answers to questions posed in class.
“They would only ask you questions,” Bok recalls of his professors in his first year of law school. “Whatever answer you gave, they would ask you another question which would artfully reveal to you quickly how inadequate your first answer had been.”
The sharp relief between the pedagogy of Stanford and Harvard Law foreshadowed a fixation that would permeate Bok’s career: the quality of teaching in higher education. Some would even observe these professors’ strategies in Bok’s own leadership decades later. Former Claremont Graduate University President Robert Klitgaard, a special assistant to Bok from 1977 to 1984, said Bok’s “great, lawyerly mind” came in handy when contending with various constituencies over tense University issues.
“He’d often repeat their arguments back to them,” Klitgaard says. “He’d repeat back, and they would adjust and say, ‘No, you didn’t get that right,’ or ‘Yes, that’s right.’ And then at the right time, before debate could boil over, he would decide.”
Other aspects of Bok’s experience at Harvard Law might come as a relief to 1Ls today. After preparing furiously for a mock exam just before winter break, he received dismal scores — C-pluses, C-minuses, and even one D.
“I’d never received grades like that in my whole life,” he says with a chuckle. “So at that point, I almost left. I just felt, ‘I’m not good enough to do this.’ But I decided I ought to at least stick it out for a year, and so if I continued to get very bad grades, maybe it would teach me I shouldn’t be a lawyer. I would at least give it a good try.”
That year, Bok confined himself to the few hundred meters between his dorm and his classrooms. “It was very intense, that first year. I don’t know how many hours a day I spent going to class or studying, but it certainly dominated my waking hours,” he says. “Until I became president, nothing had occupied me so thoroughly.”
Months later, to what he describes as “the greatest surprise I ever had in my life,” he earned high marks — high enough to become an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He eventually graduated magna cum laude and returned to HLS as a professor four years later.
As Bok settled into his professorship at the Law School, his fellow faculty members had turned their attention to one issue in particular — the battle for racial equality across the country. Bok recalls Dean Erwin N. Griswold saying in a faculty meeting in 1961: “It is a fight that is being carried on largely in the courts. And yet, when I walk around Harvard, or around any leading law school, I see no Black faces.”
In 1967, Griswold left HLS to become Solicitor General under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Bok assumed his post, as well as his commitment to increasing racial diversity at Harvard. As HLS dean and later Harvard president, Bok became an early champion of the affirmative action program Harvard is known for today.
On a December evening in 1970, two years into his deanship at the Law School, Bok received a call offering him the Harvard presidency. He declined.
“By that time, I had realized that, somewhat to my surprise, I was one of a very small number that they were giving consideration to,” he says. His cadence is measured, deliberate. “I had already figured out what my response would be when I got the call.”
When he first received the offer, Bok was reluctant to leave the Law School after only recently taking the reins. The anguish of the University Hall takeover and subsequent crackdown loomed large.
“All humor had left the institution,” Bok recalls of Harvard. “Everyone walked around grim-faced. The place was really in sort of a mess.”
Bok still demurs from sharing the defining circumstance that changed his mind, but in what he calls a “complicated” and “long” story, he was persuaded to take the job. “After I thought about it and talked to a number of people, it seemed to be on the whole probably an opportunity that I should not turn my back on.”
Once he moved into Massachusetts Hall, Bok became instantly recognizable around campus. He drove a VW Beetle to work and parked it in the University garage. He played basketball with students and dined with younger administrators in the Square. (Wursthaus on 4 JFK St., reputed for its schnitzel and sauerbraten, was a favorite.)
But this breezy public persona belied the gravitas with which Bok approached his job. Among administrators, he became known for his unusually comprehensive annual reports. An institutional tradition established decades before the Civil War, the reports allowed Harvard leaders to outline key accomplishments from the past year and challenges in the year ahead. What another president may have treated as a rote administrative task, his colleagues recall, Bok used as a philosophizing gesture, an opportunity to reflect on Harvard’s role in a changing nation.
“It was a powerful, well-presented, methodically and analytically rigorous commitment to bold ideas,” says Ira A. Jackson ’70, who served as an associate dean of the Kennedy School during Bok’s tenure. “While it was always measured and balanced — and not polemical — it was always courageous.”
Core questions animated Bok’s presidential reports over his 20 years: What was Harvard’s responsibility to the broader American public? What were the school’s obligations to its surrounding neighborhoods? When should it intervene in contentious national events, and how?
Harvard Professor of Public Policy Robert D. Putnam, who served a two-year stint as Kennedy School dean from 1989 to 1991, says Bok frequently became a spokesperson for American higher education at large.
“He was like the hood ornament on an old-fashioned car who was out there in front, deflecting all of these attacks against universities,” Putnam says.
There was also a sense of solitude to Bok’s presidency, says Neil L. Rudenstine, his direct successor.
“Derek certainly enjoyed collaboration and was very good at it,” Rudenstine says. “But he was more in the vein of the presidents who preceded him. They didn’t have provosts; they appointed their deans, but they wanted their deans to do their jobs pretty much as independent deans.”
For Bok, the solitary nature of the job was more a product of Harvard’s administrative structure than a position he actively sought.
Though he established a number of vice president positions to support him, Bok says, “I certainly felt more alone than I would if I had a provost.” Once he stepped down as president in 1991, Bok left a note for Rudenstine urging him to install a provost. “I was the only person who really thought about the University as a whole, as opposed to thinking about its particular parts as a dean would do.”
One of Bok’s general observations was the “heightened sensitivity” that had pervaded the attitudes of students both at Harvard and across the country. In his own reports, Pusey had taken sharp aim at the “minority of radicalized protesters,” as he wrote in 1968, whom he perceived to be spoiling the Harvard educational experience. While Bok maintained this concern, he also noted that engaging with students could be used to envision a better Harvard.
“The ferment of the recent past also troubled many alumni and shook the confidence of large segments of the public toward our universities,” he wrote. “Perhaps the prior sentiments toward universities were too charitable; and surely the turmoil that occurred served to dramatize larger issues in the society that badly needed honest scrutiny.”
The thorough investigation of these larger social issues, Bok soon realized, would require a school of its own.
Today, the Harvard Kennedy School is one of the world’s most prominent schools for government and public policy. When Bok stepped into the presidency, however, that was far from true. Many faculty hoped for a major institution beyond the Graduate School of Public Administration, established by a $2 million gift given generations back by philanthropist Lucius N. Littauer, that could train future government officials and public servants.
“If there’s one thing I can think of that’s missing in Harvard at this point,” Bok recalls thinking when he first took office, “[it’s] that there’s no professional school comparable to our great schools of law and business and medicine — that’s directed toward preparing people for this more and more influential and complicated task of governing the country.”
The vision for a more robust school for government and public service had been floated by prominent faculty, many of whom had ties to Washington, before Bok became president. The onus of strategizing the school’s expansion, however, would fall primarily on one scholar.
At the time Graham T. Allison, now Douglas Dillon Professor of Government, became the “founding dean” of the John F. Kennedy School of Government in March 1977, the school had no building, fewer than six full-time faculty, and no research centers. In the meeting in which Bok announced Allison’s appointment, the new dean articulated seven initiatives to strengthen the school, including expanding inter-school collaboration, securing a new building, and “consummating the marriage” between the school and the Institute of Politics, which was then its own entity. These goals would serve as a roadmap for the school’s formative years into the 1980s.
For Allison, Harvard’s strategy for continued excellence has “always stood on two legs.” The first is to make the College the best it can be. The second is “from time to time, but not often, when judged appropriate in terms of the evolution of the society and the world, to create professional schools to play special roles in the training and education and advancement of knowledge in particular arenas.” The Kennedy School, he says, achieved the latter.
Jackson, who served as an associate dean under Allison, says it can be easy to forget that the Kennedy School, for all the status it holds today, was “not ordained to succeed.” After all, at that time in the ’80s, the public’s trust in the government was wavering.
“Reagan ran on a platform saying that government is not the solution, it’s the problem,” Jackson says. “Raising money in that context, named as we were for a liberal Democrat, Kennedy, at a place like Harvard, with government out of favor — it was not a slam dunk.”
Jackson knew that all aspects of the school would have to reflect its mission to deliver a “new kind of pedagogy.” Tasked with hiring an architect for the new building, he turned down prominent architects like Louvre pyramid designer I. M. Pei for a local firm.
“We knew that we were not going to have an inverted pyramid or anything palatial,” Jackson says. “It had to be red brick, red Georgian brick. We knew that we were now going to be a new gateway to Harvard across from Eliot House — we have to look like we’re part of Harvard College, and we want to be part of Harvard College.”
By the time Bok left the presidency in 1991, the Kennedy School had more than tripled its degree students and faculty, and its endowment had grown from $21 million to over $150 million.
“When we began, there were no buildings — there wasn’t even a sort of place where the Kennedy School might be built,” Bok says. “My job was to do whatever I could to assist them, and to give them a place where they could live. They really had to establish their own identity and have their own building, if they meant to build the school that we all had in mind.”
Bok’s oversight of the Kennedy School’s expansion in the late 1970s and ’80s was his signature institution-building feat. But his interest in building Harvard — particularly the University’s civically-oriented offerings — extended beyond HKS.
For years, Bok had attempted to coax political philosophy professor emeritus Dennis F. Thompson to move from Princeton to Harvard. When Thompson was on leave in California, Bok, persistent in his dream of a more robust ethics program at Harvard, flew out to meet him.
Bok’s desire, Thompson says, was two-fold: to encourage faculty to integrate ethics into their scholarship and to teach moral reasoning to students who would graduate into an increasingly complex world. Founded in 1986, the Program for Ethics and the Professions is now known as the Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics.
Decades after his role in building the Kennedy School and the Safra Center, Bok fears the “sharp divide” between political factions in the United States today, he says, which “is more acute and which is, in a way, more threatening to government in this country.” He adds, “Certainly more so than the Nixon years when I came into office.”

By expanding a school of government, Bok hoped to allow Harvard to engage vigorously with the nation’s most pressing public issues. But aside from the pedagogy itself was the question of what kinds of people were able to receive it.
When he stepped into his deanship at the Law School, Bok looked for a practical way to build on his predecessor’s progress in making the school more accessible. Griswold had launched a program through which juniors from historically Black colleges and universities could take trial courses at the Law School and speak with Black jurists. Paired with financial aid opportunities, this program gradually increased the number of Black applicants to HLS.
“I was on the admissions committee of the first group of Black students who were chosen,” Bok says. “So I was naturally very interested in that whole process of welcoming them, making them feel at home, being as hospitable as we could and gradually seeing their numbers grow.”
For help in expanding the program into a full-fledged affirmative action policy, Bok enlisted the help of Walter J. Leonard, who served as assistant dean and assistant director of admissions at the Law School beginning in 1969.
“We could have actually filled [the] law school class without leaving the city or the suburbs,” Leonard says, listing Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston, among others. “But that wouldn’t have provided, in our judgment, the kind of class of persons who represented the heterogeneity of the United States.”
Bok calls Leonard an “indispensable partner.”
“Walter and I were very close; he was just an absolutely delightful man,” Bok says. “I greatly needed the advice of somebody who would obviously know much more than I did about what it was like to be a Black student, what they were experiencing in law school.” He adds, “Without that, I would have been kind of like a blind man stumbling in the dark.”
Affirmative action at HLS developed from the contributions of other administrators and even some students. In the summer of 1963, Russell A. Simpson, a student at HLS, got a full-time job doing statistical work in the school’s admissions office. He continued working for the office part time over the school year, and again the next summer.
“Initially, I thought exactly like the people who are now not supporting it — that it was unfair, in one way or another,” he says of the school’s affirmative action policy. “After considering it for a pretty long period of time, I finally figured out that there really wasn’t much of an alternative — and that to argue that it’s unfair is really an argument that the only factors you should be able to take into account are factors that can be measured, like grades and test scores.”
Simpson’s eventual conviction in the net good of affirmative action was amplified by his own experience in classes at HLS classes, where he found that even more so than other parts of the University, the pedagogy relied on student participation. He says he learned as much — if not more — from the peers he sat shoulder-to-shoulder with than from the instructor professing at the front of the room.
Bok believed that Harvard could influence public affairs with whom it chose to admit into its own halls. But according to Thompson, it was the experiences of students like Simpson that inspired Bok to frame the case for affirmative action in an entirely new way.
“He saw affirmative action early on as an important issue and argued not so much as a question of justice, but why affirmative action and diversity are important for the educational mission of the students who are not the subject of affirmative action,” Thompson says. “He was one of the first to see that that could be a winning argument.”
Bok would go on to participate in legal battles around affirmative action by providing expert testimony and amicus briefs. In 1998, he co-wrote “The Shape of the River,” a sprawling defense of affirmative action in higher education, with former Princeton University President William G. Bowen. Bok and Bowen turned to empirical evidence to demonstrate that increased racial representation elevated the quality of education for everyone in the classroom.
Their 472-page book used the College and Beyond database amassed by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which contains the records of more than 80,000 undergraduate students who matriculated at 28 selective colleges and universities in 1951, 1976, and 1989.
The database followed many of them after college to track their graduation status, advanced degrees, sector of employment, marital status, and number of children. From these data, Bok and Bowen concluded that affirmative action benefits students not only during college but across their lifetimes.
Skeptics argued that the book was designed to present affirmative action in a favorable light. But Bok insists the data preceded the argument, not the other way around.
“When we started, we weren’t sure what the results were going to be,” Bok says. “We had to face the fact that we might come up with the fact that affirmative action has not worked at all, if you really looked at what happened to graduates.”
The administrators did not want to simply boost the number of students of color at the Law School. Instead, they wanted to fundamentally shift what Harvard meant for individuals who were not wealthy or white — to reach out to those bright yet disadvantaged or otherwise hesitant students who “probably had not thought of Harvard as being available,” as Leonard later put it in an oral history interview.
Once Bok became president in 1971, he worked to expand these efforts at the Law School to Harvard at large. Leonard joined him as a special assistant to the president. In Bok’s first presidential report, a test for securing the regard of his new colleagues and articulating a broader roadmap for his tenure, Bok prophesied the importance of affirmative action — and the role schools like Harvard would have in its advancement.
“The efforts made to enlarge the opportunities of minority and disadvantaged groups will eventually do much to break down artificial barriers in our society,” he wrote. “I have no doubt, therefore, that these steps will be viewed one day as one of the major contributions of universities in recent times.”
Now, 50 years since Bok wrote his report, Harvard’s race-conscious admissions program appears to be on the chopping block of a conservative Supreme Court, which will hear arguments next month in a suit seeking to ban colleges nationwide from considering race in admissions. “If that becomes against the law because of the Supreme Court case, then a new leader of Harvard would have to spend a lot of time figuring out, how do we deal with that?” says Bok. “How do we maintain as much diversity in our student body as we can without running afoul of the law?”
Since his work decades ago, Bok has seen affirmative action grow into a national debate — something he didn’t expect at the time.
“When we started, I don’t think anybody was thinking about the legal side of it,” he says. “I don’t think it ever occurred to us that there would be a serious question about our right to attract Black students to Harvard, if that’s what we wanted to do.”
On other issues, though, Bok was hardly regarded as a progressive champion.
In 1976, five years into Bok’s presidency, hundreds of Black schoolchildren in Soweto, South Africa, took to the streets to protest the mandated use of Afrikaans, a language introduced and enforced by Dutch colonizers, in classroom instruction. The students were brutally opposed by the South African police, who killed at least 176 children — though some estimate as many as 700.
The protests catalyzed a series of demonstrations against South African apartheid at American universities, including Harvard.
In the 1980s, at the peak of the protests, Harvard affiliates held rallies decrying the University’s investments in South African companies through its multibillion-dollar endowment, chanting, “Hey, hey, Derek Bok, throw away your racist stock.” In 1986, students created a shantytown in the Yard to represent the one on the outskirts of Capetown to which Black South Africans had been driven under apartheid.
When the protests erupted on campus, Bok decried apartheid — but rejected calls for Harvard to divest.
In a May 1984 open letter, Bok called South African apartheid a “cruel and shameful form of racial exploitation.” Yet the question at hand, he insisted, was not the ethics of apartheid itself but what an educational institution like Harvard ought to do about it.
“My views on this matter are not casual; they involve the essential purposes of the University and the terms on which it exists and does its work in our society,” Bok wrote. He added that universities require an “insulation” from external political forces that would “impose an orthodoxy of ‘safe’ ideas or use the University for ends other than learning and the pursuit of truth.”
Bok’s stance on divestment remains unchanged to this day. Asked about his response to student criticisms in an email correspondence in September, the former president pointed to the open letters he penned in the 1980s.
Many of the undergraduates who advocated for divestment during Bok’s tenure still maintain that he got it wrong. For them, the protests exemplified a crucial misstep in Bok’s leadership, as well as the influence that powerful players like the Harvard Corporation had in his decision-making.
“This was a case where, in retrospect, we were 110 percent right — 1,110 percent right — and pretty much everyone acknowledged it,” says Damon A. Silvers ’86, a key player in student organizing against apartheid. “It became very clear that the people who were demanding divestment were the good guys, meaning that Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress, the United Democratic Front — they were asking Harvard to do this. And they were right.”
Silvers, who is now a policy director and special counsel for the American Federtion of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, says he believes the apartheid protests put Bok “in a very tight spot.”
“Harvard is not a democracy,” he says. “Harvard is run by a small group of people, ultimately, who the president has to answer to. Those folks at that time were not liberals — I think Derek Bok was meaningfully to their left. And the financial and political underpinnings of the University were not going to allow them to take really aggressively hostile acts toward the major corporate powers at the time.”
It wasn’t just Bok’s stance on divestment that sparked campus controversy. Some found his policy on gifts morally dubious, too.
In an open letter to Harvard affiliates in May 1979, Bok wrote that for the most part, he was willing to take money from unsavory or immoral actors because the University can use the money in ways that use “such funds constructively.”
“The tangible benefits of using the money for scholarships or faculty salaries should overcome the more abstract, symbolic considerations that might lead us to turn down such benefactions,” he wrote.
Consistent with these views, Bok worked to intervene in pressing global problems without compromising what he saw as Harvard’s educational integrity. In 1979, he established a fellowship to allow some South Africans disadvantaged by the apartheid system to study at Harvard; in the years to come, Harvard would partially divest from its holdings in South African countries, focusing on those that directly promoted the apartheid regime.
Still, University of Pennylvania Professor of Russian and Eastern European Studies Mitchell A. Orenstein ’89, who participated in divestment demonstrations as a Harvard undergraduate, says administrators failed to take decisive action on a morally decisive issue.
“They were trying to give a pragmatic defense of something that was pretty indefensible,” Orenstein says.
In May 1990, after 20 years in office, Bok announced that he would resign from the presidency the following year. He cited his lengthy tenure, as well as his desire for a new president to oversee a multi-year fundraising effort, as factors in his decision.
In his final presidential report, Bok reflected on the peculiar sway that Harvard held over him.
“I sometimes ask myself how I can have suffered through so many crises, gone to so many breakfast meetings, forced myself to give so many speeches, and still consider myself extraordinarily lucky to have served as Harvard’s president,” he wrote. “No other institution offers such freedom to think and write as one chooses, to enjoy such a wealth of stimulating people and engrossing activities, to be creative and independent, yet have the satisfaction of serving others in important ways.”
After his exit from Massachusetts Hall, Bok’s fixation on teaching did not end. He wrote more than 10 books following his retirement from the presidency, many of which probe the role of universities in national affairs and the ways new research can drive innovations in pedagogy.
Roger L. Geiger, a professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University who studies the history of higher education, says Bok’s books possess an uncommon quality.
“Bok had just great respect for the truth, in finding out things,” he says. “The books that he wrote, unlike the books of most other university presidents, are based on research. He actually went out and read the scholarly literature on these things, and footnoted them, and so forth. That’s very unusual, but that’s really characteristic of him.”
After Bok stepped down, Rudenstine succeeded him during a recession, overseeing the first University-wide capital campaign and navigating how to build Harvard abroad during a decade-long tenure. Then came Lawrence H. Summers, brimming with bold aspirations for Harvard’s expansion into Allston and a revamped undergraduate curriculum. But early in his term, Summers sparked ire for his remarks on supposed reasons for the lack of female representation in science, and later for his reticence about a close friend and former colleague who had been charged with criminal activity.
In February 2006, an embattled Summers resigned in the shortest presidential tenure since the Civil War. After a disruptive presidency that had sown distrust among the faculty’s ranks, the University called upon Bok, then 76, for an unprecedented second act.
Putnam, who served as dean of the Kennedy School under Bok, said he believes it is Bok’s integrity that made him an attractive candidate after Summers’s abrupt exit.
“The most important gift of character that a president can have — or any leader can have — is that you’re honest, you’re trustworthy,” he says. “That allows you to even do unpopular things, because they’ll think, ‘Nevertheless, he’s honest, he never lied to me.’ And Derek was the ultimate in that.”
After Bok’s one-year stint as acting president, Harvard gave the nod to historian and former Radcliffe Institute Dean Drew G. Faust, who became the first woman to lead the University. In her first year in office, Faust faced the 2008 recession, as well as the Occupy Wall Street movement — one she faced criticism for her reticence about. The capital campaign she oversaw raised a record-breaking $9.6 billion.
Bacow, who took office in 2018, braved the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and weathered the political headwinds of the Trump administration — which was frequently hostile to elite universities like Harvard. Like his predecessor four times removed, Bacow has been charged with defending affirmative action.
But what set Bok apart from them all was his larger-than-life presence in the national ethos, the sense of purpose about what a university ought to be that he so boldly put forth and the respect he received in turn. This type of figure, Grieger says, is one that “we’re certainly lacking today.”
“He was the spokesman for American higher education,” he continues. “You don’t have people who are willing to look at the state of higher education and say something meaningful about it. Bok was one of the very few presidents who really stood out.”
Harvard Government and Sociology Professor Theda Skocpol says Bok — alongside Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, and James B. Conant, Class of 1914 — are the three Harvard presidents who “have been giants to date” for their ability to fold more people and themes into Harvard’s mission while preserving its historic legacy.
“He was always anxious to protect the University’s integrity as a separate institutional space; he wasn’t about to let it be taken over by extreme forces pushing from the outside, one way or another,” Skopcol says of Bok. “And I don’t think he’s somebody who just listens a lot. That’s the style of many university administrators now — they’re into making people feel good. That’s not what Derek Bok was about.”
Over the years, Bok has been at turns commended for the progress he made and criticized for his unwillingness to go further. What remains constant in people’s recollections is that no matter the substance or reception of his ideas, he conveyed them to the world in earnest — that he was loyal to the best of what he believed Harvard was.
Silvers, who spent the bulk of his undergraduate years organizing against Bok on apartheid, says he believes Bok was and remains a man of integrity. “He reiterated his concern about rising inequality with no caveats, no nothing, for decades afterwards,” he says. “That rates very high in my book.”
“In ’71, everything is a mess,” says former Harvard physics professor Gerald J. Holton, recalling a fractured faculty after the University Hall takeover of 1969. At age 100, he has witnessed every Harvard president since Conant took office in 1933. “So he comes, gently smiling usually, tall, an atmosphere of sunny California about him. To find such a person was a stroke of enormous luck, because everything else was pointing in the opposite direction.”
Leonard, a key architect of Harvard’s affirmative action program, faltered when asked to describe his close collaborator in an oral history interview before his death in 2015.
“I believe that Derek Bok — ” Leonard paused, pressing his hands together for a few moments before attempting another formulation. “When one looks at his background and his history, one sees that here is a person who is quite sensitive to what the world is all about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new research study by Harvard faculty is shedding light on the significant influence of water supply on global crop yields and its connection to climate change.
The team — led by Harvard Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Peter Huybers — included Harvard Center for the Environment postdoctoral fellow Jonathan Proctor, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute postdoctoral fellow Duo Chan, and UC Irvine professor Angela Rigden.
Proctor said while precipitation is often used in studies of crop yield, soil moisture seemed like a “natural” measurement to consider. The group used soil moisture measurements from satellite data collected by the European Space Agency, which allowed them to evaluate the role of moisture on crop yields on a “global” scale.
“One of the primary findings of the analysis is that soil moisture really matters to global agricultural productivity as much, and sometimes more than, temperature,” Proctor said. “That is really important because it means that to understand future climatic influences on agriculture, we need to understand how surface metrology will change.”
Huybers likened the process by which satellites detect soil moisture from several thousand miles above Earth to the way a kitchen microwave operates.
“The reason why we can see soil moisture from space is the same reason that, when you microwave something, the water molecules get hot,” he said. “The nature of interactions between molecules and radiation is such that if they absorb at a good frequency, they also emit at that frequency.”
“When you're looking at space and you’re looking at the microwave emissions from the surface, those are dominated by the amount of water that's on the surface. So there are calibrations that are used to go from microwave intensity to the water content near the surface,” Huybers added.
Proctor said there are positive and negative implications from the study regarding climate change and its relationship with temperature and water.
“There are some aspects of the paper that are good news in terms of potentially temperature damages from climate change being less severe,” Proctor said. “But there is also instantly some bad news in that water is probably going to play a really big role in the future, and there is a lot of uncertainty about how surface soil moisture conditions will change.”
He said the group is now looking into how changes in climate might disrupt global food supply and spur human environmental migration in response to untenable agricultural conditions.
Huybers said the importance of water on food supply has political implications as well.
“Temperature changes pretty much uniformly everywhere, but water variability is heterogeneous. So climate change is going to map in a really complicated way on to local water politics,” Huybers said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Democrats published an open letter to Harvard University Health Services on Sunday asking for increased abortion access for students.
HUHS does cover obstetrics and gynecology services for students who opt into the Student Health Insurance Plan, which costs over $4,000 per year. But many students choose to waive SHIP and only pay the $1,300 Student Health Fee, which does not cover gynecological services.
As of Wednesday evening, the letter has been signed by 17 student organizations, including the Harvard Pre-Medical Society, Tech for Social Good, and Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group.
Eleanor M. Powell ’25, the events director for the College Democrats, said the letter asks the University cover the cost of abortion services to ease any potential financial barriers for students while not raising the Student Health Fee.
“It feels particularly flagrant that the Student Health Fee does include dermatology, gastroenterology, neurology, orthopedics, podiatry, physical therapy, surgery consults, X-ray, ophthalmology, optometry, allergy, and asthma services, but then doesn't include gynecology,” Powell said. “Gynecology is actually one of the only specialty services that is not included by the student health fee.”
Harvard spokesperson Tiffanie A. Green said HUHS received the letter, but declined to comment.
The College Democrats held a town hall in the Science Center on Wednesday to discuss the letter and current reproductive health offerings at HUHS. The town hall began with a reading of the letter before the floor was opened for questions and comments. Roughly 25 students attended the meeting.
According to Co-President of the College Democrats Luke D. M. Albert ’22-’23, the idea for the letter came up at a Board meeting after the Supreme Court held in June that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and reversed the landmark Roe v. Wade case.
Albert’s co-president, Isaac A. Robinson ’23, said the drafting process took place over the course of several weeks.
“We wanted to make sure that everyone was on board, everyone knew what we were asking for, and also that we had our information correct,” Robinson said.
Our Harvard Can Do Better organizer William M. Sutton ’23 said while his organization has a slightly different focus, he fully supports the demands in the letter.
“We were sort of trusting in the Dems to know that this was a thing that was an actionable demand that they could organize behind,” Sutton said. “I think our priorities lie in different projects, but we want to support them as best we can.”
Shruti Gautam ’25 — current vice president of the Harvard Chapter of the Massachusetts Menstrual Equity Coalition, a signatory on the letter — said in addition to easing the financial burden, covering the cost of abortion would send an important signal to Harvard affiliates.
“The fact that it's included means it's endorsed, and endorsed doesn't mean you're promoting it, it just means that you are going to be supported through that process, and there's someone here that believes that you should have that process,” Gautam said.
Chioma S. Ugochukwu ’23, the former president of Harvard MME, said that while it may take a while, she believes that other schools would be inspired to adopt similar policies if Harvard expands its coverage.
“I definitely think it's going to be a process, and I'm kind of expecting that we simply will make waves to start,” Ugochukwu said. “We've seen in the past that what Harvard does, what happens at Harvard, definitely affects other school systems.”
“I'm definitely expecting some sort of ripple effect,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ukrainian anthropologist Oksana Kis discussed the roles women are playing in the ongoing war in Ukraine at an event hosted by Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies on Wednesday.
The event, titled “(In)Visible Agency: Ukrainian Women’s Experiences of the Russian War on Ukraine,” was moderated by Rochelle Ruthchild, a research associate at the Davis Center.
“If asked what Ukrainian women do in this war, one can respond with confidence ‘they do everything,’” Kis said during the event.
Kis began the event by explaining how Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea has influenced the role women are playing in the current conflict, which began in February when Russia invaded Ukraine.
She said women made up nearly half of participants in the beginning of the Euromaidan, a wave of pro-European Union protests that took place throughout Ukraine in 2013 and early 2014.
“The female protestors ultimately regained their sense of active citizenship, and [claimed] their right to be equal and full-fledged citizens who want to contribute to the nation in their own way,” Kis said.
Attempts from some within the Euromaidan movement to relegate women to auxiliary roles led to grassroots women’s solidarity movements.
Kis said Euromaidan created an image of “militarized femininity” that circulates frequently in art posted on social media today in reference to the current conflict.
“Remarkably, those images usually combine rather feminine appearances like long hair and a slim body with military attributes like guns and uniforms, with clear markers of Ukrainianess,” Kis said.
“Most importantly, however, these artists also portrayed the cities in the rear, representing the homefront,” Kis said. “Thus, another part of women’s experiences in war, namely women’s participation on the homefront, appear as equal and valuable in this art project.”
Kis said that in addition to serving as soldiers, women on the homefront have taken up tasks such as healing, volunteering in kitchens, producing camouflage nets, and sewing military garments.
“Because of the large scale of production, the public purpose of such activities, and the collective nature, the meaning of these activities changes drastically as it becomes a socially significant work,” Kis said.
According to Kis, 32,500 women were serving in the Ukrainian military as of 2021 — a figure that has continued to rise since Russia’s invasion.
“Since 2014, thousands of women [have] served on the front line, and proved to be good soldiers, able to master and use different weapons and to carry out various military tasks,” Kis said. “Without praising military service as something desirable or something prestigious for women, we have to admit that there are some women who are good in that profession, and this is their way to be agents of the change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's graduate student union is at odds with the University over whether graduate students who are not employed as instructors or research assistants — but still conduct research as part of their graduate programs — are eligible for union benefits.
The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers’ contract with the University guarantees student workers at the school access to benefit funds that cover health expenses, child care, international student services, and more.
The union filed a grievance against the University on behalf of students in the Psychology Department last April, claiming Harvard violated its contract by blocking students who are not hired as instructors, teaching fellows, or research assistants from applying for benefit funds. The complaint said Psychology students should qualify for student worker benefits because they conduct research as part of their graduate programs.
But as the union and University continue to navigate the grievance process, the Psychology Department reaffirmed the ineligibility of some of its students from union coverage.
Steven W. Kasparek, a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Psychology Department, said he attempted to apply for the HGSU medical and dental reimbursement funds in early 2022. But he discovered he was not considered a student worker by the University, a distinction he believes to be a result of the external funding he receives from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.
“So I reached out to some union folks, and they said that that was incorrect and that our contract very clearly states that any student who does research under the supervision of faculty…regardless of funding source, is covered by the contract,” Kasparek said.
The union initially helped Kasparek draft a personal grievance.
“Throughout that process, we realized that there were a lot of students in the Psychology Department who were in similar situations,” Kasparek said. “So we decided to drop the personal grievance and instead file a group grievance for all of Psychology.”
On Sept. 22, Psychology Department chair Matthew K. Nock sent a statement to graduate students in the department “to clarify for our students our understanding of the current HGSU-UAW contract.”
In the statement, Nock differentiated graduate student teaching fellows and research assistants from graduate students “who are admitted to the Department as students only.”
According to Nock, the students who assist faculty with instruction or research are recognized as members of the HGSU-UAW bargaining unit because they are “hired to provide valuable services to the University.” As part of the union, they qualify to apply for the union’s employee benefit pools.
But for students like Kasparek who conduct independent research and do not teach, Nock wrote, “benefits are determined exclusively by their student status with the University.”
“These students are not student workers covered by the terms of the HGSU-UAW contract,” he wrote.
HGSU released a petition on Sept. 15, which has since garnered more than 70 signatures from University affiliates, demanding “the Harvard administration immediately grant Psychology graduate students their rightful in-unit designation.”
The petition claims the union’s contract designates any student who “performs research” while “under the supervision of faculty” as a research assistant — a position protected under the contract.
“This clearly describes ALL Psych PhD work,” an HGSU tweet reads.
The ineligibility of some graduate students, like those in the Psychology department, from union benefits is “inherently a diversity, equity, and inclusion issue,” the union wrote in a Sept. 15 tweet. It added that “students from lower-resource backgrounds, who often also hold other minoritized identities” are disproportionately impacted by the policy.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the matter is “working its way through the contractually negotiated grievance and arbitration process, therefore we have no comment.”

Across the United States, many colleges and universities are struggling to fill seats.
Between 2009 and 2020, the number of undergraduates enrolled in American colleges shrank by more than 1.6 million. In Massachusetts, the rate of high school seniors immediately enrolling in college has dropped by approximately 10 percentage points over the last five years.
But as schools across the country scramble to meet enrollment goals, the Ivy League has the opposite problem.
Yield rates at the eight Ivy schools have soared over the past 30 years, according to a Crimson analysis — and show no sign of slowing. At Harvard, the percentage of admitted students who choose to enroll has gone up by 8 percentage points since 1992. At most other Ivies, the growth is even more stark: Cornell has seen a 22 percentage point rise in its yield rate over the same period.
“I don’t think the yield landscape for the Ivies is going to change significantly,” wrote Brennan Barnard, director of college counseling at Khan Lab School. “At some point it gets high enough that there is not much room for improvement and it is unlikely to drop.”
The rise isn’t all an accident: highly-selective institutions have admissions tools that can manipulate yield rates, such as restrictive early action and early decision programs. And as ranking systems consider yield, universities often have an incentive to work to raise their rates.
“Like a lot of things in the college admissions process,” said Bari Norman, the co-founder of college counseling firm Expert Admissions, “It kind of finds its way back to the rankings, unfortunately.”
As yield increases at Ivy League universities, the number of students they accept has gone down: most Ivies take fewer students today than they did 30 years ago, though Harvard’s acceptance figures have remained steady.
At the University of Pennsylvania, nearly 5,000 students were admitted to the class of 1996 — compared to 3,500 for the class of 2026.
The trend is driven, in large part, by high yield. As the percentage of admitted students who choose to enroll increases, universities must admit fewer students in order to avoid over-enrollment. In turn, acceptance rates continue to plummet, which can translate into even higher yield rates, according to Barnard.
“The more selective a school is, people think that indicates quality,” Barnard said. “And therefore, they are more likely to yield at those schools, because they think it’s more desirable.”
The shrinking acceptance rates at Ivies also creates a “trickle-down” effect, said Hafeez Lakhani, director of Lakhani Coaching.
“There’s so much selectivity at the very elite places that really high quality students are trickling down” to other institutions, Lakhani said.
“The sort of winners in that argument are the Tulanes of the world, the University of Miamis of the world, the Americans of the world. It is harder to get into USC today than it was for me to get into Yale in the year 2000,” he added.
Yield rates often increase when early decision or early action programs are implemented — and tend to sink when the programs are taken away.
When Princeton eliminated its early decision program — which allows prospective students to apply early, but mandates that they enroll if accepted — for the class of 2012, its yield rate fell by 10 percentage points, the largest drop for any Ivy League school since 1992.
But following four years of comparatively low yield rates, Princeton reinstituted an early application program in the form of restrictive early action, which allows prospective students to apply and hear back from the school early without an enrollment requirement.
The following year, its yield shot up 8 percentage points.
“Schools are really defaulting to early decision plans,” Barnard said.
Harvard saw its lowest yield rates of the last 20 years when it eliminated restrictive early action starting with the Class of 2011. But after the program was brought back for the Class of 2016, yield rose by 4 percentage points.
“The early bird gets the worm, right?” Barnard said. “They’re getting their claws into students earlier, and so there’s a greater potential that they will yield them.”
Lakhani said that universities attempt to maintain yield in part to preserve or improve their placement in rankings from groups such as the U.S. News & World Report, which ranks universities annually.
“It becomes a little bit of chicken or the egg,” he said. “They’re protecting their yields because they know that if they're ranked 18 on U.S. News, it’ll get them more applicants than if they were ranked 26.”
“Without a doubt, people pay attention to rankings, even if it’s to their detriment,” Lakhani said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With eight games down and six wins under its belt, No. 15 Harvard field hockey is off to a rocketing start this season. The first four games were against ranked opponents: Miami University (Ohio), University of Connecticut, University of Maryland, and American University, and the team has since opened Ivy play.
“We play these games to see where we stand and what we can do against those top teams,” said head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “That's eventually the level we want to play consistently.”
The Crimson defeated Miami 1-0 in overtime and overcame American in a tight 3-2 squeeze after a game-winning goal by sophomore Lucy Leel. Though Harvard succumbed to Maryland and UConn, those losses are not to be ashamed of. Maryland, ranked fourth in the Division I National Coaches Poll, grasped a Final Four seat alongside Harvard last fall. The Terrapins victory did not come easy, however, as the Crimson scored first in the early second quarter with a fiery shot from junior Siofra Murdoch. Maryland then tied it up, scoring again late in the third quarter. Maryland had to fight to score against the tough defense of the Crimson, with defensive powerhouse senior Ellie Shahbo making six impressive saves.
“I think that the Maryland game showed us that we have the quality to play at that level, that we have the talent on the field that can compete with teams that are ranked in the top five,” commented van Herwaarden, who previously helped coach the Terrapins, winning five national championships in seven seasons.
“Ultimately I think we're still very young…I think a game like that early this season showed a lot of potential for us. That game itself created a lot of hope and excitement for what we’re able to do this season.”
First-year players have made a sizable impact on the success of the team in the past eight games, namely Bronte-May Brough, who was named Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week on Monday.
“Our first years are definitely finding their role on the team…I think that will continue to progress as we continue throughout the season” the head coach remarked.
That progress has already begun to take shape, making it more clear who fits best in certain positions, particularly within the offense. Harvard, notorious for its resilient defense, has illustrated how the offense and defense are beginning to mesh together despite the newness of the faces of the team.
“In the game against UConn, the game might have come a little bit too early for us…we still had too many people searching for their role, searching for what our best structure would be as a team to play for the season,” van Herwaarden said.
“We are more fine-tuning our pressing scenarios up front, so it's all clicking together more…with a few people stepping up to the plate and how the leadership development is, it's just been a bit better into the swing of things.”
With four of their toughest games behind them, the focus of van Herwaarden’s players right now is to get into the best shape possible for Ivy League competition. Harvard understands that people will come to Cambridge intent on beating the reigning Ivy League champions and a Final Four team.
“The reality of it all is that the Ivy games come with a whole level of energy,” said van Herwaarden. “So far every single team has been able to step up against us and play their best game…we need to be able to withstand that with our structure and stay disciplined in our organization.”
Harvard is not taking this preparation lightly; in fact, the team has trained with the United States Marine Corps in a strenuous physical test and session to get them prepped for Ivy play.
“We really felt it went well… making sure everybody feels included, part of the program, and energized,” the coach reflected.
“[It was] a different type of preparation before Ivy league play. It should get us ready for what we need to do.”
So far, that preparation has worked well for the Crimson, as they got the better of Columbia in a 3-1 contest, with goals from first-years Brough and Kate Oliver, as well as sophomore Emily Guckian.
Harvard is now on a five-game winning streak. It garnered a 1-0 victory against Monmouth by the works of a double-overtime goal from junior Avery Donahue, the same player who scored the overtime goal against Lousiville in the first round of the NCAA tournament to reach the quarterfinal round for the second time in program history.
In this streak lies three shutouts for Shahbo against Monmouth, Northeastern, and Boston University, the latter of which was the team’s Title IX Celebration Game.
As for these teams coming on strong to beat Harvard, it has followed through: in the game against Northeastern, the Huskies tried to rally near the end after the Crimson secured two hard-fought goals in the second half. However, Harvard has demonstrated that it will push back against the force brought on by its rivals.
“I think we showed that we’ve been able to do that also against Northeastern who wanted to show us up in the final five minutes of the game or so, and we also showed in the games past,” commented the head coach.
“We need to be fully understanding that every team that comes to Harvard will be the best team that they can be and present enough strength to us and do what we can.”
And still, this mighty team has yet to prove otherwise.
Harvard will next hit the road for a pair of weekend games against Ivy foe University of Pennsylvania and ranked adversary No. 10 Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, Penn.

While we have all once been (or currently are) young, bright-eyed freshmen entering this hallowed institution of higher education, our similarities often end there. Of course, we are all worthy of being here and were chosen to attend by the oh-so-mysterious admissions officers. However, some of us suffer from crippling ~imposter syndrome~ or just have the unsatiated curiosity (or enough unhinged boredom) to have that urge to open Pandora's box. Y’all know what I’m talking about — the Admissions File (*insert audience gasp here*).
For those of you who don’t know, the Admissions File is the document specifically curated about you that contains all the secrets about Harvard’s admissions process. JK, you’ll lowkey be more confused about what all the numbers mean, but you can at least read the comments that the AO’s (admissions officers) write about you.
As a freshman, I succumbed to my curiosities and requested to view my admissions file (see Flyby’s step-by-step breakdown for how to access the file in the first place). I wish I could say it was a life-changing experience that altered my whole outlook on why I was admitted or why I belong here. But, no. Anyway, to all you people who are debating whether to view the file or not, here is what you need to know.
You’ll never truly understand how they assigned your numbers
Why are some intended concentrations ranked 1 and others are 3? Did that one Model UN conference I went to in junior year bump me from a minus to a plus? How do you even measure personal qualities? There are some things that can never be known (and maybe they should stay that way…)
Don’t expect endless praise and positivity — sometimes the comments are mediocre or lowkey bad for self-esteem
It can really be a jab to your ego when you see words like “I don’t see anything special” or a series of 3’s while your friend got 1’s and 2’s. You might not even see anything of real substance at all, just the occasional generic compliment about your essays (thanks I guess, anonymous AO). That does NOT mean that you are lesser than or are any less deserving to be here. We all ended up in the same place!
Side effects include further questions on why they even chose you if they said stuff like this and/or ugly crying
Coming from personal experience, people are either compelled to deeply analyze their application to decipher the reason they got in or cry because their AO’s were so nice. Be prepared before you open your file; perhaps have tissues on hand.
At the end of the day, admissions files are just pieces of paper that don’t encompass at all who you are or what you are capable of. Don’t let its contents affect your perspective of yourself. But, if you find yourself bored one day and wondering how on earth this hallowed institution chooses its students, go ahead. Satiate your curiosity.
