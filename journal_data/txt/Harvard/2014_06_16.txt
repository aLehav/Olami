After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading up to the NBA draft, former Harvard forward Kyle Casey ’13-’14 has drawn attention from pro teams.
Casey worked out for the Boston Celtics on June 2 and on June 11, the Sacramento Kings announced that Casey will participate in a six-man workout with five other draft entrants, including Syracuse’s C.J. Fair and San Diego State’s Xavier Thames.
Casey averaged 11.4 points a game as a junior before taking on a reduced role in his final season in Cambridge, averaging only 9.7 points a game. He shot better than 50 percent in his first three seasons at Harvard and was a four-time All-Ivy League teamer. The 2009-2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year ranks among the top 15 in Harvard history in points, rebounds, and blocks.
The forward boasts an NBA-ready body, standing 6’7” with a 7’1” wingspan. At Harvard, he was both the back line for the Harvard defense and a floor-spacer for the offense. Although not an excellent three-point shooter, shooting only 35 percent in his best season, Casey was an active midrange shooter.
Many analysts have soured on Casey’s game since his breakout junior season, when he was a first-team All-Ivy selection and was ranked by CBS Sports as a top-60 NBA draft prospect. The forward was not ranked among either Basketball Insiders’ or Draft Express’s top 100 prospects and, if drafted, would likely be a second-round pick.
