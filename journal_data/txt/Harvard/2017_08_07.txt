After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a point of intriguing contradiction that despite the relative lack of artists within the realm of “Game of Thrones,” the series—in particular this week’s episode, “The Queen’s Justice”—seems consumed with fleshing out the relationship between the human consciousness and imagination.
It is a particular point of ambition for such an unambitious episode. Each of its story lines can be summarized as balancing weight of the game between the two major military players. Daenerys Targaryen loses her seemingly insurmountable military advantage through the destruction of her fleet at Casterly Rock. The Lannisters pay their debts by negotiating with the Iron Bank and capturing Highgarden. Jon Snow receives permission to mine the dragonglass required to fight the White Walkers. (Jon and Daenerys also meet.) However, I would rather not focus on a banal breakdown of each of those storylines; the procedural elements of “Game of Thrones” have always been less intriguing than its bizarre stabs into philosophy and human psychology. Perhaps more intriguing is inquiring if “The Queen’s Justice” has anything to say about the psychology of its pawn-like players.
Is “The Queen’s Justice” a complex exploration into the way imagination works within its characters and its writers? Is it exploring the relationship between cruelty and creativity? When Cersei Lannister pontificates, “I lie in bed and stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies”—should one note the clear connection between imagination and murder? Is this bastardized ideal of imagination—murder as, in Cersei’s words, “poetic”—unknowingly refracted in Lady Olenna Tyrell’s last speech? “Whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of house Tyrell, I did,” she said. “But your sister has done things I was incapable of imagining.” Is that, the creation of the unthinkable, the highest form of imagination; is “The Queen’s Justice” arguing that the objectively horrifying moment in one of the series’ most artful scenes—the bombing of The Great Sept of Baelor (an act that Olenna was unable to “imagine”)—was an artistic act, in and of itself, before the addition of lingering cinematography and cued music? Is imagination synonymous with cruelty? Is it synonymous with—as Cersei uses the Mad King's accelerant—madness itself?
Or perhaps not. Perhaps this piece of dialogue is simply, in one of the writer’s own words, “[Olenna winning] her own death scene.”
Is that—the “prize mistake: a failure of imagination”—the real currency that governs the delicate line between life and death for each of these characters? Is that “failure of imagination” what Tyrion Lannister is alluding to when he says, “I came down here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack”? Is a failure of imagination why Daenerys's army fails? Is that what Petyr Baelish is alluding to when he monologues, “Fight every battle, everywhere, always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy. Everyone is your friend. Every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you’ve seen before”? (To Aidan Gillen’s credit—the actor who portrays Baelish—these words sound far more potent when spoken on camera than printed on a page.) Is imagination then a god-like understanding of all potentialities, included within them, the depth of cruelty that can be contained within the consciousness of mankind? Even in one of the subtler moments of the episode, isn’t it the understanding of the entirety of past and present then enables Bran Stark to cruelly recall a series of events that he did not witness—to imagine—Sansa Stark’s marriage (and everything that followed) to Ramsay Bolton?
Or, perhaps Littlefinger’s lines are supposed to be a play at laughable irony (see: Sansa’s marriage to note Baelish’s prodigious powers of prediction). Perhaps Bran is present to show the ravishes of adolescence on a stable mood. Perhaps Tyrion goes to brood with Jon to place two likable misfits on the same cliff side.
If, in a certain sense, imagination becomes valued within the world of “Game of Thrones” because it has become an agent of cruelty, what does that say about the writer and the artist? What does it say about the individuals that created this world wrought out of ice and fire? What becomes of the mind that imagines the elemental imaginings of Cersei? Perhaps the more interesting question is what value does the artist have in a world where the highest form of imagination is akin to the most unrestrained form of cruelty?
Perhaps the value of that artist is the value of the gods in the world of “Game of Thrones.” As Cersei and Jaime write the future through battle, the uncreative lie rotting in the forest’s soil—refusing to envision that even the consummation of vows can turn into a bloody affair. Perhaps the imaginative share in the creation of prophecy. Perhaps the same future that the creative have built will be the same future that Melisandre predicts: a future in which she and Lord Varys both die. For who is the Lord of Light but the mind that writes?
These questions may prove valuable. They may not be. But in the moments when “Game of Thrones” is comfortable using extended runtimes to simplemindedly level the playing field for the coming fight, at least the writers provide something worthwhile to contemplate. I do not necessarily endorse or reject the position of “The Queen’s Justice” on imagination, but I do believe that these questions are necessary to consider in order to understand the schema of thematics that underpin the show. It could very well be that “Game of Thrones” has nothing intelligent to add to our understanding of imagination—but I hope, for the sake of our collective cultural imagination, that “Game of Thrones” is slightly more than dragon-porn, torture-porn, political-porn, and old fashioned, HBO sponsored, soft-core-porn.
Yet before I go, and before we watch these last four episodes of the season, it seems necessary to ask where we, the audience, fit into my suggestion about the show’s relationship with imagination and cruelty. When Jon Snow meets Daenerys Targaryen for the first time, it should be particularly apparent that the audience holds a specific role within the world of “The Queen’s Justice.”
Neither Jon nor Daenerys have the creativity to imagine what the other could be—at least, not without the pomp and circumstance that follows the respective king and queen in the form of advisors and amusingly untrimmed introductions. However, the audience transcends the limited imaginations of Daenerys and Jon—we have lived with their characters for far too long to call them “the Mad King’s daughter” and a “northern fool” respectively.
We exist, in a certain way, in the transient state beyond imagination; we have picked up, like Bran, the pieces of a past narrative and placed them into the imagined whole that we call the world of “Game of Thrones.” One can hope that cruelty will not become part of our own narratives. But perhaps that is the pleasure of watching—and not living—“The Queen’s Justice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, you can take one look around any dining hall and see them—an all-white friend group of five or six, sitting together talking about who-knows-what. Unlike an all-black or brown group, they don’t garner unwanted attention or criticism of self-segregation. As I binge-watched 10 seasons of “Friends” this summer in my temporary, non-air-conditioned Harvard dorm room, I realized why these all-white friend groups are allowed to exist in peace.
“Friends” features six adults in New York City. Despite living in one of the most racially diverse cities in the country, every single one of them is white. When actors of color make an appearance on the show, they’re relegated to supporting roles.
For instance, Julie, an Asian American girlfriend of white main character Ross Geller, is one of the few characters of color who appears in multiple episodes. The show makes jokes about her ethnicity, including when Rachel Green, Ross’s main love interest, assumes she’s from China and doesn’t speak English, reinforcing the racial trope of the perpetual Asian foreigner. As a character, she’s written without much depth and is simply a barrier in the Ross/Rachel romance. When done playing her part, she’s tossed aside to the margins, like most non-white characters on the show. “Friends” is not a show about any group of friends—it’s a show about a group of white friends.
Unfortunately, “Friends” is not the only show featuring a group of white friends that sees people of color as one-dimensional figures to fill supporting roles. HBO’s “Girls” came under fire for its cast’s homogeneity, and when the show introduced more black characters, it only did so to create props who fit long-standing stereotypes. “How I Met Your Mother” features yet another group of all-white friends, and more examples of casual racism sold as comedy.
What, then, happens when people of color attempt to make white friends who’ve been nursed on media that depicts non-white people in such narrow ways? Often, students of color like me end up in a precarious position. We want to make the most out of our time at predominantly white institutions like Harvard, which means making white friends that we might not have had at our segregated high schools. But we also want to avoid the racial insensitivity that can be a burden on our mental and emotional health.
Navigating this fine line reveals a truth that makes people scream “reverse racism”: Having white friends, as a person of color, can be exhausting. It’s much easier to make friends with other people of color who already understand the way the world pushes against you because of the melanin you carry in your skin. As Erin White argues, “in one way or another, White friends, largely, just aren’t safe to have” because of “their unconscious but blatant biases against and misunderstandings of Black People.”
And though I’ve experienced this exhaustion in many social interactions with white people, my two best friends at Harvard are white. Their friendships have never once felt unsafe, or like a burden, and it’s largely because they have intimate understandings of the things that would have otherwise been sources of tension between us—my brown skin and Salvadoran immigrant background.
One of these friends lived in South Africa, a country still grappling with its history of apartheid. The other grew up in an bilingual immigrant household. The gap in understanding between us that would have otherwise sowed racial strife was already bridged when we met freshman fall.
Unfortunately, not all white people understand the experiences of their non-white friends so intimately. White supremacy manifests itself subtly but insidiously in the white liberal who wants to avoid having a homogenous friend group but whose ignorance puts people of color in uncomfortable social situations.
Luckily, white people can actively work to ensure that their friendships don’t become a burden on their non-white peers by filling this gap themselves. To learn about the complexity of immigrant stories, read both Junot Díaz and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. To understand what it means to be black in America, flip through the pages of James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates. For the Asian American experience, read Amy Tan and watch Ali Wong and Hasan Minaj’s stand-up comedy.
As we begin changing the way “traditional” friend groups—the ones on “Friends” or “How I Met Your Mother”—look, it’s critical to realize that the transition will be disproportionately difficult for people of color. So, as good white friends, it’s on you to work to understand what being brown or black in America means. Consume media created by people of color to understand what our lives are like, instead of repeatedly asking us to explain it to you. Put in the work instead of forcing us to.
