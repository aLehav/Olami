After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is easy to be great, but hard to be good.
My grandfather, Martin Glassman, passed away last week at the age of 89. He was born in Brooklyn to parents who immigrated from Eastern Europe, and was raised in the Bronx. When he was a child he suffered from a seizure disorder that impaired his intelligence. His parents did not treat him well, so at 17 he enlisted to fight in the Korean War. When he returned he moved to New Haven, Conn. In his career as a postal worker, he was bullied for being Jewish and not intellectually advanced. As a result he was only promoted one time in his whole career. Nothing was given to him in his life, but he never complained.
There is a story by Isaac Loeb Peretz called Bontche Schweig, or “Bontche the Silent,” about a man who lived in a shtetl and never kvetched, or griped. He had an oppressive life of poverty and tragedy. When he died, he went to heaven, and was shocked. How could he, the simple Bontche, receive such an honor? He must have been confused for a great Rabbi who looked similarly. But all uncertainty was cleared up when the defending angel took the stand and talked about Bontche Schweig and his life! How could an Angel in heaven be impressed with some ordinary man in a shtetl? Then, even more amazing, when the prosecuting angel took the stand, he said of Bontche “he was always silent — and now I too will be silent.” No word was spoken against him.
Since Bontche was now in heaven he was permitted to ask for anything in the whole world. He just requested a hot roll for breakfast every morning.
In Judaism, it is commanded that we walk into a room with a smile, or else we deteriorate the mood of those around us. My grandfather was always happy. He never was never angered and always sweet. He did what he was told and was happy with what he got. When my aunt was growing up, she would give him all the food she didn’t like, and take the food from him which she did. Despite his preferences he would give his food: Either way he would be happy, and it was more important that she ate what she enjoyed.
Harvard students are pushed to be the best, to be ambitious, and to create a legacy. Whether we aspire to wealth, prodigious intellectual and artistic contributions, or transformative change in our community, we seek to be great. But greatness is a form of pride; seeking it is idolatry. I have been ambitious, greedy, and vain. I have wondered how I can have a legacy that surpasses time, so one day someone may remember my name. But, as with Ozymandias, even the most sublime statues will one day crumble. We will probably be remembered for no longer than 75 years after our deaths, and it won’t be too long after that until someone utters our name for the last time. Even the greatest men, like Caesar or Shakespeare, will be forgotten.
We have to aspire first and foremost to be good. A legacy is ultimately meaningless. We need only to focus on being as kind, grateful, and humble as we can in our own lives. Social justice does not matter without individual justice. It is easy to shout about how other people need to change and other people need to do things, but the only way we can actually effectuate change is through embodying it ourselves. Through doing good and modeling virtue for others we can start to create a more just society.
It is undeniable that ambition has led to many important achievements such as medical advances, agricultural abundance, and political stability. Insofar as we are capable, we should pursue that which is beyond ourselves that can have such positive ramifications. However, all of these are fruitless without a simultaneous and preceding good. Evil and goodness start with the individual, hate and love start with the individual. Without first pursuing individual virtue, all global accomplishments are inevitably stained. Humility does not mean thinking we are worthless, it means believing that we are not entitled to anything and that while we may be greater than others, we are rarely better than them.
Yet being good is extremely hard. It requires us to sacrifice our ego, to admit that there is someone greater than us, and to moderate our greatest passions so they do not consume our sensibilities. Finding true and simple satisfaction is rarer than indulging in one’s skills to be greater than another. We want in so many ways a legacy, but we should much rather prefer a good life. I have much more “potential” than my grandfather did, but I can only hope that I’ll be half the man he was.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 5, 2021 at 12:02 a.m.
For Harvard students who lose the Color Health Inc. Russian roulette and get a positive Covid-19 result, their anxieties do not end at contracting the infamous virus. Awaiting them is a maelstrom of confusing logistics, limited supplies, and virtually zero human interaction. Even more stress-inducing is the iron curtain that stands between them and their lecture halls, practically guaranteeing a week spent swimming against the academic current.
Harvard must establish better systems of support for its students who test positive for Covid-19. With its twice-a-week testing program, indoor mask mandate, and social gathering restrictions, the College has implemented a cohesive strategy for mitigating and tracking the virus. Once a student tests positive, however, it appears that Harvard’s careful plan of action falls apart.
Harvard University Health Services has — if crudely — established isolation housing in the Harvard Square Hotel and Cronkhite Graduate Center. Students are ushered to these locations upon receiving a positive test result and told to remain in place for 10 days, during which they may not come into contact with any humans, save for one health check-up per day.
A friend of mine, who spent a portion of September in the hotel after contracting Covid-19, shared with me that unpalatable food and loneliness characterized her isolation experience. So too did Sawyer Feller ’25, who told me he spent six days there before his rapid test result was deemed a potential false positive and he was released. He complained of constant hunger and added that his ration of over-the-counter cold medicine had been partially consumed by a previous resident when he arrived.
Moreover, The Crimson reported in early September that an isolated student was rushed to Mount Auburn Hospital for severe dehydration after their pleas for water went unheard (or perhaps ignored).
These issues of sustenance and emotional support reflect areas in which HUHS can make easy, quick, and impactful improvements to students’ 10-day sentences under their oversight. Just as pressing, however, is Harvard’s need to establish better academic support for students stuck in the hotel or Cronkhite.
As it stands, the University essentially tells students “good luck,” pats them on the back, and sends them on their way to catch up with schoolwork (all while potentially lonely, hungry, or dehydrated). A friend of mine expressed that they spent isolation stressed and confused, managing unresponsive professors and convoluted make-up assignments without any structured system of support whatsoever. Some classes refuse to provide recordings of their in-person lectures; few offer class notes or summaries to those whom Covid-19 bars from class.
Recovery doesn’t have to be this difficult for Covid-positive Harvard students. Princeton University, for one, has laid out an elaborate contingency plan through which they aim to ensure students in isolation can keep pace with their studies. “At a minimum, faculty should establish a standing Zoom link,” Princeton says of situations in which a member of a class tests positive.
Additionally, the University of Southern California maintains constant video-conferencing links for all its in-person classes, which are available if a student or faculty member contracts the virus.
The University may find it unappealing to organize a private Zoom-webinar inlet to its lectures and seminars; to do so might threaten the sanctity and artificial scarcity of its classes. For the same potential reason that Harvard arguably deflates its acceptance rate to confer exclusivity upon its academic resources, the University might balk at transmitting precious material through something as accessible as the internet. Still, the open appearance is a price worth paying, as Harvard students’ studies shouldn’t suffer due to medical reasons.
Those apathetic towards the needs of Covid-positive Harvard students might contend that an easy means of avoiding the isolation program is cautious behavior. Sure, students could stop partying indoors or eat their meals with the same two people every night, but the fact that Harvard has, by bringing students on campus, created a small yet unavoidable risk of contracting the virus obligates them to ensure that Covid-positive students have every support measure they need. A student could be hyper-cautious and still test positive, due perhaps to a dining-hall passerby or problem set partner. Thus, it is Harvard’s responsibility to guide its students through the isolation process while caring for their physical needs, emotional wellbeing, and academic success.
Peter N. Jones ’25, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Weld Hall.
Correction: Nov. 5, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that as of Thursday, Oct. 28, 72 Harvard students were in isolation housing. In fact, there were only 6 College students in isolation on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s endowment just got bigger — like, $11 billion bigger. The Harvard Management Company returned 33.6 percent on its investments this fiscal year, pushing the endowment’s value to a colossal $53.2 billion: a sum roughly equal to Slovenia’s GDP. While the endowment isn’t exactly a bank account (much of the gifts that compose it are earmarked for specific schools and purposes), a sizable chunk of the multi-billion-dollar fund is unrestricted.
These returns, plus the University’s $283 million budget surplus, mean Harvard has emerged from the pandemic in great financial health. But what does this wealth mean to the workers that Harvard, when faced with financial uncertainty, cut loose?
The endowment’s increase, which defied expert concerns that the pandemic would cripple returns, fits a broader trend. Yale, MIT, and Dartmouth all reported investment returns of at least 40 percent this year, increasing their endowment, in proportion, more than Harvard. In this sense, Harvard lost — but we’re not convinced such comparisons are all that helpful.
HMC is open about its “lower risk” approach to endowment management. In the words of HMC’s CEO, “the tradeoff is, of course, higher returns versus a less volatile revenue stream.” This fiscal year, Harvard underperformed the S&P 500, which, during that period, went up about 40 percent. But this staple stock market index also plummeted 48 percent in just over six months during 2008’s Great Recession. The percent Harvard’s endowment shrunk was nearly half that. To us, this signals the value of Harvard’s endowment management strategy. With an endowment as large as ours, positive returns of any size rake in major rewards. That careful approach has served us well, and ought to continue — even if it means granting Yale a victory in percent returned.
Thankfully, this surge in higher education endowments hasn’t been limited to the Ivies. Duke reported a smashing 56 percent endowment return, and the University of North Carolina batted a strong 42. Ultimately, these returns mean more capital is available to support the pursuit of knowledge (the glorious mission of any university) and to support staff and students. We hope this cash influx offers some desperately needed relief to the financial struggles that have plagued American higher education for years, which were only worsened by the pandemic.
Yet at Harvard, the news of our swelling pockets stands in stark contrast with our administrators’ depressing choices, which have prioritized wealth over workers. Over the past year, citing fears that economic downturn might inflict long-lasting damage on our coffers, Harvard announced it would stop compensating most contracted workers idled by the pandemic, reduce pay for University staff, and freeze salaries and hiring. Even now, after our continued affluence has been affirmed, the University insists on denying graduate student workers a fair, inflation-adjusted raise, condemning the entire student body to a justified and disruptive three-day strike.
Of course, Harvard couldn’t have predicted that financial markets would boom following the pandemic any more than it could have predicted the pandemic itself. But our resilient prosperity highlights that there was another way forward. What if, when faced with a murky financial future, Harvard took a more generous approach and maintained the workers it stopped paying? What if the University, with the biggest financial cushion of any, had chosen to protect members of our community in a time of precarity, rather than discard them? Hindsight, surely, is 20/20. But it’s a little heartbreaking to think that Harvard could have withheld the pay cuts many custodians and security guards were hit with, not cut paychecks at all, and, financially, still have come out on top.
But even if things didn’t end up all right — if the economy didn’t spring back, if our endowment didn’t end up topping $53 billion — what if Harvard, as we urged it to, decided to suck up a potential financial loss and protect its workers anyway? We wish this chance for moral courage had been taken.
Harvard’s prioritization of its wealth over staff and their families’ wellbeing amidst a once-in-a-generation pandemic was always morally wrong; now, it has proven shortsighted and unnecessarily harsh. It was a call people were hurt by.
While the individual damage from Harvard’s austerity cannot be undone, Harvard can now strive for a more generous approach to what our endowment can mean for its staff. University administrators ought to remember that the same booming economy that helped enlarge our endowment also contributed to increasing costs of living across the United States. Cambridge, with its roughly 4 percent increase in average prices, is no exception. Offering graduate workers raises that don’t account for their salaries’ decreased purchasing power is simply unacceptable.
We all stand to benefit from a stronger, better-funded academic world. At Harvard, the individuals that breathe life into our institution — contracted workers and graduate students alike — should benefit too. After all, if we can’t look out for our own, what good is that $53 billion?

Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Oxford University developed a new artificial intelligence model that can determine whether a gene variant is benign or disease-causing.
EVE — short for evolutionary model of variant effect — is an AI tool that has analyzed more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and classified more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance, according to their paper published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature.
Using complex machine learning methods, EVE examines patterns of genetic variation in nonhuman species to detect variants involved in causing disease and ultimately extrapolates those results to the human genome.
The model examines the relative prevalence of a certain variant across genomic regions in order to assess its likelihood of causing disease, according to Mafalda Dias, a postdoctoral researcher at HMS and one of the study’s first co-authors.
“The assumption behind the model is that, if a variant is very common in evolution, it is probably because it’s not pathogenic,” she said. “But if it never occurs, it’s very rare and probably there is something wrong with it, because evolution has gotten rid of it in a sense."
Unlike existing AI models that rely on previously-established human labelling of gene mutation effects, EVE is an unsupervised technology that solely uses deep learning methods to model complex genomic patterns, according to Jonathan Frazer, another postdoctoral researcher at HMS and first co-author of the study.
“It’s the ability of the deep learning methods to pick up on these patterns that allows us to be able to say if a variant is highly improbable under the model, and therefore it’s never been seen in evolution, and therefore it’s probably likely to be disease causing,” he said.
Frazer also said that the motivation for this study stemmed from global, scientific efforts to sequence all life on earth and understand evolution.
The long-term goal of EVE is to help provide additional guidance for clinical geneticists in diagnosing patients with genetic-related diseases, according to Pascal Notin, another co-first author of the study and a graduate student at Oxford University.
“It is more of a tool that will help a physician make the correct diagnosis,” he said. “This is not what will drive the diagnosis itself.”
Frazer added that he believes the development of EVE and other genomic technologies is only “scratching the surface” of the potential clinical applications of data-driven tools.
“You can imagine the distant future where we can build models of the whole genome and a patient can come in and they can give their entire genome and we can interpret all the variants that are there and all of the interactions,” he said. “I suppose that’s the long-term dream.”
Dias also said that continued developments in machine learning can be used to effectively analyze the vast and growing amounts of genomic sequencing data.
“I really think that we are in a time where these cross paths between biological data and advances in machine learning can be really, really fruitful,” she said.

Harvard Teacher Fellows — a teacher training initiative for students at the College — will no longer accept new cohorts of students as it is rolled into a new degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Harvard Teacher Fellows was created in 2015 to prepare students and recent alumni to teach in under-resourced urban schools. Beginning in 2022, the initiative will be subsumed by the Teaching and Teacher Leadership master’s program at the Graduate School of Education.
While undergraduates are encouraged to apply for the new program, students who do not attend the College will also be able to apply — a change from the previous initiative.
In addition to Harvard Teacher Fellows, the new master’s program will also absorb two other decades-old education programs: the master’s-level Teacher’s Education Program and the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program.
“It makes for a much more cohesive experience across the board, and we're really excited about how this builds off of the strengths of all three programs,” said Noah S. Heller, current director of Harvard Teacher Fellows.
Heller — a faculty member for the new program — said he is working to disseminate information about the transition through established undergraduate communication channels.
“Our recruitment for HTF has pivoted and everyone who we were in communication with, we have tried to be in touch with about the new TTL program,” Heller said.
Allison P. Pao ’21-22, who is currently applying for the new master’s program, said she was surprised that she had not seen more publicity about the transition.
“It's been a little bit frustrating and confusing just because of the lack of information on the [Harvard Teacher Fellows] website and also lack of explanation on the website of how TTL is the same and different to HTF,” Pao said. “As someone who had a thorough understanding of the HTF program, I would have loved to see some more information on the differences and similarities between TTL.”
Meaghan E. Townsend ’21, a current Harvard Teacher Fellow, explained one of the key differences between the two programs is that the new master’s program will offer two separate tracks.
The residency track — modeled off of Harvard Teacher Fellows — will allow fellows to take on teaching responsibilities in classrooms right away, while the internship track will provide “a little bit more runway to get adjusted to what it means to be a teacher,” she said.
While she is “hopeful” about the new master’s program, Townsend said she questions whether all interested students would know to apply.
“My biggest concern is that Harvard students don't know about this program and so won't apply to teach,” she said.
Townsend called the timing of the remodeling of the Harvard Teacher Fellows program “unfortunate” since it coincided with the College’s decision to not offer General Education 1076: “Equity and Excellence in K12 American Schools” — a gateway course to the secondary in Educational Studies — this school year.
“This is the year in which the baton of educational interest has been fumbled,” she said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on Gen Ed 1076. She said in a previous statement that the course was placed on a two-year rotation due to “budget constraints” necessitated by the pandemic.
HGSE Professor Victor M. Pereira, Jr., who co-chairs the new master’s program, acknowledged the quick turnaround of the application process this year given the transition.
“Time might be tight,” Pereira said. “I would suggest for any folks just reach out to the TTL program, to the assistant director, Andrena Mason, if you're having trouble or need time with application materials.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tensions with Harvard police, undergraduate walkouts, and support from public officials and student groups marked the second day of Harvard’s graduate student union strike.
On Thursday, the union formed picket lines in Cambridge near Menschel Hall, the Science Center, Smith Campus Center, and Massachusetts Hall, where the offices of University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 are located.
Across the Charles River, at Harvard’s Longwood Medical Campus, picket lines circled in front of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Biomedical Research Building, the New Research Building, and Gordon Hall, which houses the office of Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82.
The three-day strike, which started Wednesday morning, comes after seven months of bargaining between the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University failed to produce a second contract.
During morning picketing in Cambridge, Harvard University Police Department chief’s aide John Fulkerson told strikers at Menschel Hall that they had to stop picketing on University property, according to bargaining committee member Cory W. McCartan.
HGSU-UAW Trustee Andrew M. Bergman added Fulkerson later told strikers inside of the Science Center to make a smaller picketing circle to leave more space for people to get through, or else he would arrest picketers.
After the union notified HUPD leadership of the encounters, McCartan said HUPD met internally and reassured the union that members were picketing legally.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in a statement that the University, HGSU-UAW, and HUPD established that the union has a right to strike on University property while observing the National Labor Relations Act.
“In line with that discussion, HUPD has continued to work cooperatively with HGSU-UAW leaders throughout the day to maintain access to various locations around campus for strikers, while also ensuring strike activity is carried out in line with University policy and the NLRA,” he wrote.
Fulkerson declined to comment at the picket lines, citing HUPD media policy.
Around 11:30 a.m., many undergraduate students walked out of class to join HGSU-UAW members, filling Harvard Yard with union chants before filing into the Science Center Plaza for a rally.
“We had such huge numbers at our noon picket and rally,” HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Aparna Gopalan said. “I think [undergraduates] might have even outnumbered us.”
At the rally, HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member and Sergeant-at-Arms Maya I. Anjur-Dietrich told the crowd Harvard had not put forth a counterproposal at Wednesday’s bargaining session.
“I think to some extent what happened in the session was pretty expected,” Anjur-Dietrich said in an interview later Thursday afternoon. “The University is going to use all of its tools possible to tell us that striking doesn’t work and that our power doesn’t faze them, and I think really the opposite is true.”
The union claimed the strike disrupted classes that enroll approximately 2,900 undergraduates in total. A slew of classes across the College, the Kennedy School, the Graduate School of Education, and the Law School have seen walkouts or cancellations during the strike.
Anjur-Dietrich added she does not expect the University to return with a counterproposal before the strike ends Friday. Swain declined to comment on the current state of negotiations.
Harvard faculty and public officials also spoke at the rally in Science Center Plaza. Anthropology professor Ajantha Subramanian and History professors Alison Frank Johnson, Walter Johnson, and Kirsten A. Weld all voiced support for HGSU-UAW at the rally.
Boston City Councilor Lydia M. Edwards and Boston City Council candidate Ruthzee Louijeune, a Kennedy School alumna, also spoke at the rally. Over at Longwood, Somerville City Councilor Ben S. Ewen-Campen, a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences alumnus, spoke at a noon rally in front of Gordon Hall.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Boston mayoral candidate Michelle Wu ’07 stopped by picket lines in front of the Smith Campus Center and voiced their support for the strike on Twitter.
After marching through Cambridge, picketers returned to Science Center Plaza, where various Harvard social justice groups set up tables, including the Student Labor Action Movement, Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies, and Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign.
Jordan H. Barton ’23, president of the Harvard College Young Democratic Socialists of America, lauded the widespread support for the union, but said the union’s organizing efforts are far from over.
“The plight towards the contract, the plight towards fair wages, the plight towards a better workplace for our grad and undergrad workers is a long-term project that we’re just getting started on,” Barton said.

At approximately 11:35 a.m. on Thursday, undergraduates walked out of their classrooms into the Yard and adjacent buildings to join the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers on the second day of the union's strike.
Participants in the walkout — organized by Harvard Student Labor Action Movement and Harvard College Young Democratic Socialists of America — said they hoped to cause a disruption in the classroom and show support for graduate student workers.
“Undergrads are only one degree removed from the thing that actually makes our University, which is our student workers,” said Jordan H. Barton ’23, a walkout organizer and member of Harvard YDSA. “Undergrads who attend those classes that are being disrupted, when they actively walk out, they demonstrate solidarity.”
For Barton, the walkout was a testament to the important role graduate students play at the University. It furthered the aims of the strike by helping “truly shut down” Harvard, he said.
On top of the walkout, YDSA established a hardship fund to support graduate student workers who are losing pay from the University by participating in the strike. The fund was created on Monday and has garnered over $12,000 dollars as of late Thursday, according to Barton.
Harvard YDSA and SLAM also planned a week of programming to support the grad student labor movement, including teaching freshmen about the labor action movement and picketing in Cambridge and Longwood.
Undergraduates said they joined demonstrations Thursday for numerous reasons, ranging from personal experiences to support for teaching fellows.
Caroline Choi ’24 said her father’s experiences as a student worker motivated her desire to participate in the union's strike.
“My dad was a grad student worker way back when he first immigrated and I saw how hard it was to live paycheck to paycheck,” Choi said. “I know student workers here must be struggling as well, and it's definitely not enough pay for them to be working this hard.”
Caroline H. Dent ’24 — who walked out from General Education 1093: “Who Lives? Who Dies? Who Cares? Reimagining Global Health” — said that she wants graduate student workers to have a fair contract.
“Maybe one day I'm going to go to graduate school, and I would want to be a TF and a part of what makes Harvard such a vibrant academic community. And so of course, if I want that for myself, I want that for my wonderful TFs who are giving me such a great education,” Dent said.
Lavanya Singh ’22, an undergraduate teaching fellow for Computer Science 263: “Systems Security,” said that she is striking because she supports the union's demand for legal expense funds and third-party arbitration for some gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment cases.
"I think everyone at Harvard has an interest in Harvard being a harassment-free campus and frankly, the current policies are that most survivors can't afford the same amount of legal infrastructure that Harvard can,” she said. “It's obscene to ask the graduate students or an undergraduate to pay for their own lawyers in a battle against an institution like Harvard.”
In a proposal on Tuesday, the University suggested a legal expense fund of $50,000 per fiscal year. In an email to members later that night, HGSU-UAW stated that the amount is inadequate, since it “severely limits the support we can provide to survivors.”

Harvard’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston reflected on the work of the Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging and her first year in her role in a Thursday interview with The Crimson.
OEDIB — which is led by Charleston — published a 16-page report on Oct. 19 that outlined the office’s strategic framework and initiatives over the 2020-21 academic year.
When Charleston arrived at Harvard in August 2020 amid the remote school year and nationwide protests against police brutality, she said OEDIB pinpointed a need to address “heightened anxiety.” Charleston said OEDIB found an “antidote” in creating remote spaces for marginalized groups to support each other.
“We relaunched them as affinity spaces because we recognize, even as people are coming back to campus, that there was still an ongoing need for people to be able to connect in communities with others who they identified with,” Charleston said.
Per Charleston, OEDIB centered its work around three strategic priorities: organizational excellence, community engagement, and leadership.
She explained that OEDIB’s work in “organizational excellence” has been particularly successful over the past year, highlighting how the office has grown with its recent digital outreach officer and a manager for engagement appointments.
Part of the endeavor for achieving organizational excellence includes what the report referred to as “inclusive infrastructure.” An initiative in this category was renaming what was previously ODIB — the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging — to add “equity” and become OEDIB.
“We saw in various spaces that there was a clarion call to make sure that we were not forgetting the equity component,” Charleston said.
The report also emphasized “inclusive excellence,” a framework that aims to embed policies and initiatives around diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging into Harvard’s mission and culture.
This initiative included issuing grants from the Harvard Culture Lab to incentivize on-campus groups to pursue diversity-related projects within their organizations, along with leading the Community Dialogue Series, which has included speakers like former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in the past.
Charleston said the pandemic revealed that OEDIB needs to continue working on the Community Dialogue Series to forge stronger connections among Harvard affiliates.
“We, in many ways, needed to elevate our game in terms of the ways that we provided support, not only to students but also staff and faculty, and the pandemic forced us to do that,” Charleston said.
OEDIB hosted an event Thursday evening called “Lost and Found,” which encouraged affiliates to reflect on what was lost during the pandemic and what may have been gained or learned.
When asked about her time at Harvard thus far, Charleston positively described her first year in the role and said she has found a “warm and welcoming community” at Harvard.
“I have found a community of citizens who are engaged and innovative and creative and generous with their time and their thinking and that has been absolutely fantastic,” Charleston said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After unsuccessful campaigns in 2015, 2017, and 2019, Ilan Levy, a software engineer, is focusing on bringing together Cantabrigians in his fourth run for City Council this year.
“In Amish society, if a house burns down, the community gets together to rebuild it. In ours, we call an anonymous insurer,” Levy said in a video posted to his campaign website. “We have forgotten our interdependence. We have forgotten our community.”
Levy, who did not respond to a request for an interview, wrote on his website that he wants to use the 2021 election to launch an “Encyclopedia of Nonsense, a repository of imaginary solutions for the future of our cities.”
Levy contends that Cambridge’s Plan E charter — which invests executive power in a city manager appointed by a city council which performs legislative and oversight functions — makes the city run like a business, focused on financial outcomes rather than social progress.
“We need to stop thinking like economists,” Levy said in the video. “It destroys community. Community means we recognize, appreciate, and understand our interdependence with each other and mother nature.”
Reforming contract zoning policies would be another priority if elected, alleging that current zoning policies in Kendall Square have led to “more traffic, less affordable housing, displacement, loss of open space, loss of floodplains, loss of community,” according to his 2017 website.
Levy is originally from Belgium but has lived in Cambridge for two decades, according to his website. He wrote in a 2017 campaign statement that he served on the board of the East Cambridge Planning Team from 2007 to 2011 and advocated against the controversial redevelopment of Sullivan Courthouse from 2013 to 2015.
Levy was one of 23 arrested during a protest in Boston for Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2013. With the hope to “resolve our deep systemic issues,” he became a United States citizen and ran for the city council in 2015, according to his 2017 campaign statement.
“I got involved with Mass. Action Against Police Brutality…and at one of the protests I got arrested,” Levy said in 2019. “There was quite a presence of police power and I figured that any system that requires that much violence in order to maintain itself must be wrong and…that’s why I’m doing politics and being involved.”
Levy also encouraged Harvard students to extend their activism beyond campus into local politics.
“I know there is a lot of activism at the University, but I find it very unfortunate that that activism doesn’t expand into the city and into the neighborhoods,” he said in 2019. “Local politics in particular can be the one place where we can start making a real difference.”
In his 2021 campaign video, Levy focused on social activism and engagement with Cambridge residents.
“​We cannot afford to wait for a leader,” Levy said. “We have to get together and barn-raise our vision for our cities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students may have noticed a flyer under their dorm room doors last month for Burhan Azeem, who, at 24, is the youngest candidate running in the Cambridge City Council election.
Azeem immigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan when he was four years old and grew up on food stamps and Medicaid. He studied sustainable energy at MIT on a full scholarship and has lived in Cambridge since his freshman year of college.
Azeem said his relative youth would be a valuable addition to the City Council, noting the difference in age between voters and city council members.
“The city we walk around in is the city we think we live in, and then you go into City Hall and you see a very, very different city,” he said. “I thought that there were a lot of views that weren’t being represented accurately.”
Affordable housing is the central issue of Azeem’s platform. Informed by his experiences with housing insecurity growing up, Azeem runs a nonprofit called Abundant Housing, which does policy work at the state level. He hopes to expand Cambridge’s Affordable Housing Overlay and legalize more of the city’s housing.
“Something like 70 to 80 percent of the housing in the city is illegal, so it couldn’t be built the same today if it was destroyed in some way or another,” Azeem said.
Azeem said he saw the challenges of Cambridge housing firsthand during his time as an undergrad at MIT, when the city rejected the university’s plans for more student housing.
“I was forced to live in a hotel my freshman year because we were out of space,” Azeem said. “There were a lot of little things that happened like that — that you felt like City Hill didn’t care.”
Azeem also said he hopes to significantly reduce carbon emissions in Cambridge by expanding public transit and bike access.
“A lot of the city still doesn’t have bike lanes and buses in particular get stuck,” he said. “Having bus lanes and more frequent buses can be a huge thing there, as well as making a lot of new development — especially in Kendall Square — net-zero so it doesn’t release carbon emissions can be a pretty impactful thing.”
Azeem said he would be an advocate for the middle class amid Cambridge’s transformation into a “barbell society,” with a few high-income residents and many low-income residents.
“We focus a lot on those two demographics,” Azeem said. “You want to have a full spectrum of people in Cambridge, and I think without that we become very segregated by income.”
This election is not Azeem’s first time running for Cambridge City Council — he was the runner-up in the 2019 election.
“The first time you run, you kind of have to prove that you’re a serious candidate,” Azeem said. said. “So this time, I think you come with seriousness because I was the runner up that like, ‘hey, this guy has a very good chance.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
E. Denise Simmons — who made history as the first Black lesbian mayor in the United States when she was elected Cambridge mayor in 2008 — is seeking her 11th term on the City Council this November.
Simmons, in her fourth decade in city politics, has advocated for progressive economic and employment policy, housing reform, environmental initiatives, and diversity. Within the city government she previously chaired committees on housing, diversity, and university relations.
Simmons said her commitment to fairness and social justice today is influenced by her upbringing in Cambridge. In an interview with The Crimson, she said her mother— who moved to Cambridge to provide her children with better opportunities — taught her the value of giving back. Simmons said she believes she holds the responsibility to pay those opportunities forward.
Looking ahead to a potential 11th term on the council, Simmons said improving the visibility of minority-owned small businesses around Cambridge is a top governing priority for her.
“When I got to the city council, I said ‘why are we not purchasing local first?’” Simmons said. “Why are we not making every effort to purchase from Black and brown businesses?”
Simmons established a registry of minority-owned small businesses in Cambridge, which was intended to make their services more accessible to patrons seeking to support them, like herself.
Simmons also said she takes pride in the city’s commitment to diversity and equal opportunities, and said she was optimistic for the city’s future.
“What makes Cambridge special is that we really try to be the best at what we do,” she said. “The best at equal opportunity, diversity, equality, access, tolerance.”
“We don't always make the mark, and that's the other side of that, but we certainly do try,” Simmons added.
Nevertheless, she said she hopes for increased racial diversity in both Cambridge’s public schools and in the municipal government.
“I’m very proud that we have a lot of women in leadership; the other side of that is we don’t have enough women of color,” Simmons said. “We’re not educating sufficiently and significantly enough Black and brown and Latinx children.”
If reelected, she said it is a priority for her that the council vote in a new city manager who reflects the city’s diversity — after Louis A. DePasquale retires in July.
“It's time for that,” Simmons said. “I want to be there to make sure that we hear from the voices of every possible citizen from every corner of our city to weigh in.”
Continuing to strive for improvement, Simmons said, is a philosophy that frames her policy positions.
“Part of what I see as my role on the council is making sure that we continue to try to apply some introspection to see what are we not doing?” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First-time Cambridge City Council candidate Frantz Pierre, who is seeking to become the city’s first male Haitian American councilor, is running on a platform of improving access to education and housing.
Pierre, a lifelong Cantabrigian, has centered his campaign around reducing economic and educational inequality. If elected, he plans to expand youth opportunities, increase affordable housing options, improve eldercare, and develop entrepreneurship programs, per his campaign website.
Pierre, who grew up in a family of 15, held events throughout July 2021 to raise support for his candidacy and garner enough signatures to get on the ballot.
Pierre has raised just shy of $2,000 since the start of the year, according to state campaign finance filings — the third-least of any Cambridge City Council candidate. He had less than $400 in the bank at the end of September, filings show.
Pierre has been engaged in Cambridge civic action from a young age. He has worked at all five youth centers in the city, beginning at age 13 when he served as a junior counselor at the Area 4 Youth Center, a local child care provider. While attending the Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School, Pierre was the point guard for the basketball team and taught meditation skills to local elementary school students.
Pierre also held several roles at the Margaret Fuller House, a service organization that provides support to low-income residents, including working as an intensive care coordinator, recovery specialist, and housing specialist coach.
A father of three, Pierre is focusing his campaign on expanding educational opportunities. He wrote to the Cambridge Chronicle that “a thriving educational system will set the tone toward improving economic development.”
“I think it’s time that we get the kids in Cambridge a true chance to succeed,” he said at a virtual forum hosted by Create the Vote Cambridge on Oct. 19.
Pierre, who earned an associate's degree from Hesser College in 2006, currently works as a care coordinator at the Boston Medical Center and as an intensive care coordinator at the Home for Little Wanderers, which provides aid to at-risk children.
During an Oct. 7 virtual candidate forum, Pierre said he hopes to improve trust between local residents and the police.
“It brings a bad taste in certain communities when police only show up when things are going wrong,” he said at the forum. “If the person that’s getting called on is uncomfortable, and the police showing up is uncomfortable, then it’s going to be a disaster.”
In his statement to the Cambridge Chronicle, Pierre wrote that he “has witnessed the lack of cultural representation, support, and trust” in Cambridge. He added that he “understands the need for diverse resources, and the importance of following through with commitments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Victor A. Clay arrived to helm Harvard’s police force in July, the department was facing allegations of decades of sexism, racism, and favoritism among employees, as well as campus activism calling for its reform or even abolition.
After an eight-month nationwide search, the man Harvard chose to tackle those myriad challenges is a 30-year veteran of law enforcement who cut his teeth on the streets of Los Angeles before moving into campus policing seven years ago. He enjoys taking patrol shifts alongside his officers, struggles to balance his job with his family life, and says his identity as a Black man shapes the way he approaches policing.
Clay said in an interview last month that he was working as a grocery clerk and “just being the dude street racing on the weekends” when his friend encouraged him to apply to become a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy.
“I took the test and never looked back,” he said.
Clay stayed with the department for 28 years, earning a meritorious conduct medal for bravery in 1996. In 2014, Occidental College — just a few miles from where he grew up — named Clay its chief of campus safety.
Clay arrived at Occidental when the school was facing national scrutiny surrounding its Title IX practices, which were the subject of two federal complaints.
One of those complaints accused Occidental of failing to report sexual assaults as required by federal law, an issue Clay tackled during his tenure there.
“It was during Chief Clay’s tenure that a full-time Clery coordinator was hired and additional training was provided for staff responsible for Clery reporting,” Occidental College spokesperson Jim Tranquada wrote in an email.
Clay also collaborated with college officials and the Los Angeles Police Department to develop new procedures for responding to sexual assault, Tranquada added.
Clay said Occidental was a “great opening experience” for his career in campus safety.
“It’s small, a lot of energy — you could see the development. I was there for three years, so I saw pretty much almost a full group of students go from first year to graduation,” he said.
Three years after arriving at Occidental, Clay was named the chief of campus security at the California Institute of Technology, where he worked until he arrived at Harvard in July.
Clay said Caltech places a heavy focus on research and has relatively less social interaction than other college campuses, making it a different experience from Occidental.
“I didn’t have that much contact,” Clay said. “Or I didn’t see the socialization that I see here.”
A former co-worker at Caltech, Kathleen A. Carpenter, wrote in an email that Clay “pretty much changed everything” at Caltech, developing a stricter rank structure and more evenly distributing workload around the department.
Carpenter credited Clay with bringing “diversity and fairness” to Caltech’s force.
“We were dealing with covert sexism and limited representation of female, Asian, and African American officers within the department,” Carpenter wrote. “Women just weren’t even considered for interviews. The first thing Vic did was empower the women we did have working in the department and hire female officers.”
According to Carpenter, Clay’s “[no]-nonsense” personality initially made it difficult for Clay to navigate Caltech’s campus politics.
Once he did, however, things calmed down, she noted, adding that people either did or did not like Clay, and there was not too much in between.
“He could be rather abrasive at times, and not always approachable, but I always felt that he answered my questions and concerns honestly,” Carpenter wrote. “I felt that he made a point to put me in a position that was challenging but also made sure I had the tools available to succeed.”
Similar to his time at Occidental and Caltech, three months into his new role at Harvard, Clay is faced with the task of making major reforms to campus safety, including implementing the recommendations of an external review commissioned by University President Lawrence S. Bacow in 2020.
In April, the University formed a HUPD advisory board composed of affiliates from across the University, following one of the recommendations of the report. Clay met with the advisory board for the first time this semester.
“We’re going to look at every single aspect of [our policies] with the advisory board and get their support in some of the things we do,” Clay said. “And then I’m going to look at how efficient our department is, like, ‘Do we have some gaps in training? Do we have gaps in our response?’”
Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22, who serves on the advisory board, said it remains too early to judge Clay’s tenure, but noted he is “more encouraged” than he has been in the past because of Clay’s willingness to pursue change.
“I think there’s no easy way to do it, there’s no fast way to do it — you just have to take the feedback, implement changes, and then hope that the trust is restored,” Harris said.

A local carpenter and lifelong Cantabridgian, Gregg J. Moree is hoping to stand out among the 18 other candidates to clinch one of the nine open seats in the Nov. 2 Cambridge City Council election.
This campaign marks his seventh bid for a city council seat.
If elected, Moree hopes to focus on issues ranging from education, equal pay, housing, and environmental conservation, per his campaign website.
In addition, Moree’s website says that he believes “ALL LIVES MATTER,” affirming this stance with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1944 Economic Bill of Rights, which he says “helped to form [his] opinions and political platform.”
Born in Cambridge, Moree and his family boast a century-long lineage born and raised in the city. He attended the M.E. Fitzgerald School—now the Peabody School—and the Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School. After graduating, he continued his education at the North Bennett Trade School for carpentry.
Moree explains on his website that much of his dedication to public service comes from the mentorship of his uncle, Joe Sakey, who he describes as a “civic and community activist and entrepreneur.”
A main priority for Moree is improving education and hands-on learning opportunities available for local youth, according to his website. In addition, Moree hopes to create and implement youth apprentice and internship programs in Cambridge industries for local students to take advantage of.
“Cambridge has so many great companies and hi-tech opportunities that there should be more internship programs,” he writes. “Companies and developers should have mandatory, signed contracts with the city to develop internships for young Cambridge residents.”
In a 2019 interview with The Crimson, Moore pointed to the special relationship between Harvard and the city of Cambridge and proposed city-funded sponsorships that would allow local low-income students to attend the university.
“We have lots of kids that are smart. They just don’t have the money to go to Harvard, so maybe there’s a way we can get them into Harvard by sponsoring them,” he said at the time. “The city can sponsor kids to go to Harvard.”
Beyond his focus on education, Moree hopes to increase the minimum wage to ensure that all Cambridge residents have access to affordable housing. In addition, he wants to increase job opportunities in Cambridge by connecting local residents with area construction jobs.
Moree’s previous bids for City Council have been sullied by his criminal record, which includes assault and battery charges. Moree has denied these claims.
Moree did not respond to a request for an interview.

Robert Eckstut wants to take a progressive ethic and a poker player’s mentality to Cambridge City Council.
The 36-year-old Connecticut native and political consultant said his skills and policy agenda make him the best choice for voters seeking progressive change.
“I genuinely believe that I would be the best city councillor the city could have,” Eckstut said. “I believe in myself, I believe in the goals, I believe in the mission statements. I really want to make that happen.”
Eckstut has largely a progressive policy platform in his debut campaign, throwing support behind initiatives such as City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan’s Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition, which would charge large commercial buildings for their greenhouse gas emissions. Eckstut has also pledged to support renters through rent control policies and fight the homelessness crisis by upping funding to Cambridge Housing Authority. Other reforms he supports include free public transportation and more civilian oversight over the police.
“I believe very strongly in governmental spending,” Eckstut said. “I believe very strongly in social spending.”
Eckstut spent his early 20s living and studying around the country while playing poker professionally. After taking a break from school to play poker full-time, he spent two years at the Harvard Extension School before finishing his studies at Lesley University. He said his experience playing and coaching poker gives him a valuable, analytical approach to public policy.
“The true gift for poker players is being able to assign ranges and equities,” Eckstut said. “In other words, with very limited information, make the best guesses you can, and then with those guesses, try to implement the best strategy going forward.”
A few years after leaving professional poker, Eckstut said he worked on Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, and later began consulting for progressive political campaigns in Connecticut and Massachusetts, focusing on state-level politics. He said he hopes to bring the progressive, anti-establishment politics espoused by Sanders to Cambridge, where he feels the city council is unresponsive to the sentiments of Cambridge residents.
Eckstut cited the council’s failure to pass municipal broadband internet despite broad support, and said they did not stand up to the city manager in order to push it through.
“They haven’t done anything,” Eckstut said. “There’s no progress being made for municipal broadband. It’s dead, it’s not happening.”
He said he is working to educate voters about these shortcomings in the other candidates.
“Some councilors are very happy with the job they’ve done, but they’ve done nothing,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After working as a bartender in Cambridge for more than 30 years, first-time candidate Joe McGuirk is hoping to bring some economic diversity to the Cambridge City Council.
McGuirk was raised by a working-class family and has been a part of the service industry for more than three decades. This past year, he was unemployed for the first time due to the Covid-19 pandemic and as a result, he said his platform focuses on affordable housing, blue-collar workers, and bringing working class issues to the forefront of the council’s business.
He argued that while Cambridge may be a very progressive city, issues like housing showcase that decisions are still made by those with more “economic might.”
“I'm kind of tired of hearing that we're champions of housing and watching Cambridge become one of the most expensive cities to live in the country,” McGuirk said.
To McGuirk, this is a personal issue, he said. Over the years, he has witnessed many of his coworkers, friends and family get pushed out of the city. Furthermore, he said he believes that the council has failed to do enough to mobilize its resources to address this issue.
With his partner working in health care, McGuirk said he is aware of the impact this pandemic has had on those working in the field.
“I don't mistrust our government, I'm inclined to follow the lead of the CDC, despite some very big mistakes made,” McGuirk said.
He also addressed the need to expand education opportunities for young adults outside of the four-year college path.
“We concentrate a lot on STEM education in Cambridge, and I think that's great,” McGuirk said. “But I think we also have to concentrate on options for children who are not looking at a four year college.”
While McGuirk recognized the connection between Cambridge and its universities, he said he believes that Harvard and Cambridge could be better partners, particularly when it comes to mitigating climate change.
“It's really important that young people demand that generations like mine recognize that this is not an issue we can kick down the road,” he said.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment.
McGuirk also said he believes more needs to be done to protect cyclists, but he acknowledged that “the process is dividing” the people involved. He cited the Oct. 2020 amendment of the Cycling Safety ordinance, which sped up the construction of dozens of miles of cycling areas in Cambridge.
McGuirk said this amendment failed to take into account the perspectives of small business owners and car users. If elected, he pledged to address the issue in a “consensus building way.”
In regards to the Harvard graduate student union strike, McGuirk said he will “stand with the strikers.” As a child, McGuirk’s father brought him to union strikes, which he said led him to see the value of collective bargaining. Now, he hopes to be able to participate in the ongoing demonstrations.
McGuirk also explained he initially felt self-doubt about running, and never thought anyone would vote for him because he was a bartender. As the campaign has progressed, he said he has grown more confident.
“Whether I win and lose is less important than the fact that I'm excited to have met a lot of people who feel the same way I do,” McGuirk said.

Growing up in a politically active environment, Nicola A. Williams is dedicating her second campaign for City Council to addressing the concerns of Cambridge residents.
In an interview with The Crimson, she argued that the Covid-19 pandemic revealed deep inequities in the city.
“Our voices weren’t being heard by the city,” Williams said.
She also said that in making policy decisions, the city council needs to “center equity and justice.” She said this can be accomplished through public engagement, a strategy she has years of experience in.
In regards to housing, Williams said the city needs to enact policies that compensate for the loss of rent control in the city, which ended more than two decades ago.
She said she lived in a rent control apartment 25 years ago and that when the policy was changed, she was at risk of losing her housing. She was able to organize her building and fight for the opportunity to buy her apartment.
“I’d like the same opportunity for any resident who wants to own a place in Cambridge,” she said.
Williams also said her focus on equity extends to racial disparities, housing, and the environment, hardships she says she has seen firsthand in her more than three decades in Cambridge.
Williams’ campaign focuses on social and economic justice. She wants to create an “environmentally-friendly and equitable community that prioritizes people before developers,” per her website.
A focal point of her campaign is affordable housing. She supports a model similar to New York City using rent stabilization, which she says can ensure no Cambridge resident is left without affordably-priced housing.
Williams’s centerpiece proposal is a “50/20” plan to raise the Cambridge housing stock considered affordable from 14 percent to 20 percent, and create an equal number of homeowners and renters in the city. She said it is a multi-pronged approach to fix Cambridge’s affordable housing problem.
“We can’t build our way out of it,” she added.
She also hopes to implement environmental policies that help all Cambridge residents, especially those from marginalized populations. She said she will advocate for the city to reduce its carbon emissions and plant more trees.
Her platform also hopes to reduce education inequality. She noted that the pandemic left behind many children in school, specifically low-income Black and Hispanic students.
“I believe in meeting birth to preschool with universal preschool and equal access to after school programs as critical to educational outcomes to combat the student achievement gap,” her website reads.

After two terms on the City Council and a decade in activism, Quinton Y. Zondervan is seeking reelection to continue pursuing his diversity, equity, and green initiative goals in Cambridge.
Zondervan said Covid-19 exposed the decaying “community infrastructure” in the city of Cambridge.
“One of the things that we saw is that our community infrastructure continues to erode and that makes it harder for us to respond to any emergency, including Covid. We don’t know our neighbors. We don’t have local services available,” he said.
In addition, Zondervan highlighted how the economic crisis caused by the pandemic exacerbated the underlying economic disparities that riddle the city.
“People who have technology jobs who can work from home, by and large, are not terribly impacted economically,” he said. “People who have low wage jobs, who have to go into restaurants or grocery stores, artists, those people were heavily impacted because they couldn't go to work or it was unsafe for them.”
While Zondervan said he was confident that Cambridge’s economy is recovering, he added that the “fragile” pandemic economy reveals how there are too few protections for those at the lower income levels.
Zondervan said he is an advocate for housing justice and noted his proposal to allocate a $500 million bond to produce new affordable housing units to combat the “really precarious” Cambridge housing situation.
Though a proponent for housing justice, Zondervan criticized the current mechanisms put in place to protect tenants in Cambridge. He explained that the City Council should explore other options, such as rent control and greater protections against arbitrary or retaliatory evictions.
“Another piece we have to work on is protections and particularly keeping the rents from going up arbitrarily without the support of the state house because the state legislature outlawed rent control,” Zondervan said. “So far, the legislature has failed to act.”
Aside from housing justice, Zondervan is also an advocate for “complete demilitarization” of the Cambridge Police Department. In spring 2021, he proposed CPD destroy and recycle military-grade weaponry, including rifles, shotguns, and the armored vehicle.
The policy order was substantially amended before being passed, and Zondervan plans to continue pushing for further demilitarization.
In addition to demilitarization, Zondervan said he also wants to promote programs such as the Cambridge Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team, which would dispatch non-police responders to the scene of an emergency.
“When we talk with the police, they tell us 80 percent of the calls that they receive are not violent crimes. Those calls have no business going to them,” Zondervan said.
A longtime climate activist and former board member of sustainability nonprofit Green Cambridge, Zondervan has also developed his own Green New Deal for the City of Cambridge. His proposed legislation consists of three essential pillars: emissions accounting, mitigation fees, and a program designed to promote “green” jobs.
Zondervan said he supports Harvard’s pledge to begin divesting from fossil fuels, explaining that he has been advocating for this development for nearly a decade and noted that the University “is taking steps in the right direction.”
When asked what sets him apart from other candidates, Zondervan highlighted not only his unique experience in the council to date but also his core values for a more inclusive Cambridge.
“I really bring that experience in policymaking to the council, as well as a really deep commitment to always protecting the most vulnerable and prioritizing equity in our policymaking, so that we become the anti-racist city that we should be,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hired as head coach of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team in 2019, Gerry Byrne has been tasked for the last two years with creating and fostering a team culture during the Covid-19 pandemic. With only four games under his belt due to the truncated 2020 season, Byrne found creative ways to build his unit.
“The culture development, the skill development, personal development, all the stuff that I am tasked with doing as a head coach, it’s not just skill development, it’s developing young men and reinforcing values,” Byrne said. “That happens all the time, every day, whether you’re physically together on the field or whether you’re physically together on campus.”
He emphasized the importance of his players wanting to get better, saying that growth comes from their desire to improve, not his mandates to practice.
“There’s only so much time because of NCAA and Ivy League rules that we can be on the field. And if it was just me coaching them, they would never get there,” he explained. “So peer to peer mentorship, coaching, film study, doing things when I’m not around, is kind of an indicator of where your program is going, and I see examples of that, dozens every day .… It foretells future success for us over the next few years.”
To maintain the team’s connection during the pandemic, Byrne assigned a book and a documentary for the squad to read and discuss. However, he held only a handful of full-team Zoom sessions during the 18 months away from campus, emphasizing the benefits of student-driven connections.
“Part of that was them going to train in Georgia and going to visit each other across state lines and across the country,” he explained.
With many players taking time off in order to preserve academic and athletic eligibility, Byrne’s squad will include a large group of upperclassmen this spring.
“They enjoy each other’s company, they hold each other accountable. They set standards and enforce them,” he said.
Byrne’s focus on a player-led team bridges a divide between performance and participation. When discussing how having a larger team would impact the dynamic cultivated in what is normally a much smaller roster, Bryne was insistent that his upperclassmen were instrumental in promoting an inclusive and supportive culture. His community-based approach allows his starting players to excel on the field while helping the entire team develop.
The Crimson is coming off of two decisive wins against High Point University and the University of Richmond at a play-day at Johns Hopkins sponsored by the HEADstrong Organization. The scrimmages mark the first time the Crimson has taken the field since spring of 2020.
“I was happy with our performances,” Byrne said. “Obviously it’s always happy when you score more than your opponent. But there’s plenty of things for us to work on. You know, I think we have to get bigger and stronger, and in better condition.”.
Early in the season, he has focused on developing his players’ fundamentals and understanding of his program structure.
“You have to figure out what combination of film and strength and conditioning and practice you could do because you can’t do all of them as much as you would like. So, I chose to work on teaching our guys how we play,” Byrne said.“As we head into this next phase, that November, early December phase, we’re probably going to get to the point where we’re lifting and conditioning three or four times a week.”
In the wins over High Point and Richmond, Byrne was happy with the way his squad connected on the defensive and attacking ends and felt that goalie play was strong. However, despite the victories, he admitted that Harvard had not found as much success clearing the ball as he had hoped. Byrne said that the team will place a specific focus on that aspect of the game this week in practice.
“We have to look at either how we are coaching it or maybe the guys’ lack of understanding — maybe we’re not doing the right drills,” he explained. “Maybe we’re not teaching it in the right way, but that was a real shortcoming, so those will be our areas of focus here in November.”
This is a critical area for the team to excel at because the shot clock means that it is imperative for the defensive players to quickly transition the ball up the field to utilize the entirety of the timing on the attacking end.
Team chemistry was a particular focus for the Crimson in the weekend's scrimmages, as two new classes of players took the field for Harvard for the first time. Connection was apparent early on in the offensive end, as junior midfielder Isaiah Dawson fed assists to senior attacker Austin Madronic. Playmaking by underclassmen, specifically sophomore attacker Sam King and first-year midfielder Andrew Perry, stood out for senior midfielder and face-off-get-off specialist Steven Cuccurullo, who praised the underclassmen after the game.
“The freshmen and sophomores playing in their first college scrimmage played really well and were a huge role in the team’s success,” he said.
Harvard is set to take on its first Ivy League opponents since 2019 under Chris Wojcik ’96, who guided the Crimson to a 60-57 record over his eight-year tenure as head coach. Before coming to Harvard, Byrne had coached Notre Dame for a total of 16 seasons, and his team has already exhibited grit in its few performances under his tutelage. He improved Harvard’s defense from 71st in the nation to 34th and took the man-down squad from 41st in Division I to fourth, giving up just one goal for all four games played in 2020. His recruiting class for the 2024 division contains three Inside Lacrosse Power 100 players on the incoming freshmen rankings list, which is promising for their future contributions to the team.
Looking into the upcoming season, Coach Byrne said he is figuring out how to best allocate the six hours a week he is allowed to spend coaching his players and is excited for the season to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the day before Halloween, a hungry Dartmouth team will emerge from the big green forests that line the 120 miles of the I-89 and I-93 between Cambridge and Hanover, N.H. Traveling to Massachusetts under the cover of rainfall and thunder, the Big Green will battle with the Crimson in stormy weather, gritting out every play in what promises to be a ground-bound, defensive affair. At the end of sixty minutes, if No. 21/RV Harvard (5-1, 2-1 Ivy) can outlast RV/RV Dartmouth (5-1, 2-1 Ivy), the victory would be its first over the Big Green in three seasons and mark the next crucial step in its quest for its 18th Ivy League championship.
Both teams will enter Harvard Stadium on Saturday at 12 p.m. coming off a loss. The Crimson will hope to bounce back from a heartbreaking, controversial loss to Princeton on Oct. 23. Meanwhile, Dartmouth failed to score any points under the Friday night lights in Hanover, falling to Columbia, 19-0, on Oct. 22. However, at 5-1, both of these teams are still in the thick of the conference title race, and Harvard players are confident that the result in their previous game will not affect them as they seek to take down the Big Green.
“It was a really great game,” said senior linebacker Jack McGowan, who led the Crimson with 11 tackles in the Princeton game. “We’re obviously disappointed in the way it ended, but we’ve turned the chapter on to this week, and we’re getting ready to play Dartmouth.”
Harvard has plenty of positives to take away from its loss to the Tigers, including the stellar performance of its defense, which intercepted four passes to increase its season total to 11, tied for the seventh-most in the country. In the process, defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99’s unit became the national leader in team passing efficiency defense (93.88). The Crimson held Princeton’s offense to just 257 total yards, well below its season average of 422 yards. Of those 257 yards, just 50 came on the ground, which actually increased its season average to 46.3 yards per game, the lowest rate in the country. Additionally, Harvard allowed the Tigers to score just six points in three trips inside the 20-yard line, becoming the most efficient red-zone defense in the FCS, allowing opponents to score on just half of their drives deep into Crimson territory.
“We have some really great defenses for when we get down with our backs against the wall,” McGowan explained. “And it is a mentality thing. We definitely play harder when we know that we can’t afford to give up any yards.”
For his performance against Princeton, McGowan was awarded the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week award, the first Harvard player to do so this year. Despite McGowan being the only player to garner that particular honor, the Crimson’s stingy defense has been a full-team effort. Harvard has gotten through for an FCS-leading 4.83 sacks per game, led by sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec and junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes, who each have brought down the quarterback 5.5 times this season. Their performances are buoyed by that of first-year defensive tackle Thor Griffith (3.0 sacks), who was named to the 2021 Stats Perform FCS Jerry Rice Award Watch List for the best freshman in Division I on Wednesday. In addition, junior safety James Herring and senior linebacker Jordan Hill, the 147th Captain of Harvard football, lead the team in tackles with 42 apiece.
On Saturday, Harvard will face a unique opponent. Dartmouth boasts a unique scheme, often lining up with four tight ends, forcing the Crimson to spend much of this week implementing new packages into its defensive game plan. The Big Green’s unorthodox look has paid dividends in the past, for it has won each of its last two matchups against Harvard. In 2018, it claimed a 24-17 victory in sloppy conditions in Hanover, and the next year, the New Hampshire squad eked past the Crimson, 9-6, at Harvard Stadium.
Dartmouth returns much of the foundation from those two victories, including quarterback Derek Kyler, a fifth-year senior who owns the best career passing percentage in school history and who has tossed nine touchdown passes against one interception this season. Kyler’s most frequent targets are his trio of speedy wide receivers: Paxton Scott, Jamal Cooney, and Isaac Boston. Cooney is the team’s leading receiver with 192 yards this season.
In addition to Kyler, Dartmouth relies on quarterback Nick Howard, who often takes direct snaps and poses a threat in both the running and passing games. This season, he has already earned College Sports Madness’s Ivy League Player of the Week award for his performance in an Oct. 1 victory over Penn, in which he took 19 carries for 101 yards and two touchdowns in addition to completing a pass for 13 yards.
“We have two separate schemes for those guys, and each of those guys comes with a different set of challenges,” McGowan said. “[A key is] just being able to identify the personnel that are coming in the game and basing our game plan on that.”
Howard is a key part of the Big Green’s strong running game. So far, Dartmouth has averaged 177.2 yards per game on the ground, which is good for 30th in the FCS and just behind the Crimson’s 26th ranked rushing attack (185.3 yards per game). In addition to Howard, running back Zack Bair has accumulated 346 yards and two rushing touchdowns this season, and running back Noah Roper rushed for 108 yards in the Oct. 16 victory over New Hampshire.
But if the Big Green’s game is built on speed, so is Harvard’s, which boasts a three-pronged rushing attack and a trio of fast receivers to match Dartmouth’s. The Crimson has presented a perfectly balanced offense so far this season, rushing for 1,112 yards and passing for 1,112 more. Its star is junior running back Aaron Shampklin, who ranks ninth in the nation with 101.6 rushing yards per game. He has also found the end zone seven times. Furthermore, sophomore running back Aidan Borguet plays a huge role in Harvard’s rushing attack, adding 425 yards and five touchdowns of his own. Sophomore running back Sone Ntoh completes the trio, having scored against Lafayette on Oct. 16 for his third touchdown of the season.
In the game against Princeton, senior quarterback Jake Smith came on in relief of sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean, who left the game at the end of the first quarter. Smith completed 21 of his 37 passes for 184 yards and led the Crimson on a touchdown drive at the start of the fourth quarter that culminated in Shampklin’s two-yard run. Although offensive coordinator Mickey Fein typically does not ask his quarterbacks to throw too much, Smith will have a speedy trio of receivers to target.
Junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly has been a consistent offensive presence this season and leads the team with 198 receiving yards. Opposite Wimberly, senior wide receiver B.J. Watson has contributed 140 yards of his own this season, including a 75-yard touchdown against Cornell. Junior wide receiver Demarkes Stradford is known for his speed and caught four passes for 37 yards against Lafayette. First-year tight end Tyler Neville led the team with four catches for 58 yards against the Tigers.
“We’re a very fast team, and I don’t think there’s any team in the league that can keep up with us, speed-wise,” Watson said. “So we just have to make sure when we have those opportunities, we capitalize on them with big plays and execute when we have those opportunities.”
Dartmouth, a veteran squad led by senior linebacker Jalen Mackie, will hope to use its second-ranked passing defense to bother Harvard’s receivers. The Big Green has allowed just 146.2 yards per game through the air this season, which ranks 8.4 yards per game better than third-placed Montana State. Mackie is enjoying a breakout season with 54 total tackles, good enough to lead the team. In addition, its rush defense ranks 24th in the country, allowing an average of just 116.5 yards per game on the ground.
“They play a very base defense, so they don’t do too much, but what they do, they do it well,” Watson said. “They all know their assignments and know what they’re doing. They don’t do too much crazy stuff. We saw Princeton, they’re bringing the house every play. And Dartmouth, they’re sitting in their base coverages playing Cover 4, Cover 3, but everyone just knows exactly where to be.”
Each team’s running game will likely be highlighted during Saturday’s matchup, given the forecast. The temperature is supposed to sit in the high 50s and rain is expected throughout the entire game. In such conditions, throwing the ball can become more difficult; in the 2018 game in Hanover, Dartmouth attempted just 11 passes all game, completing only four. In the wet and windy conditions forecast for Saturday, the Crimson and the Big Green, who already run the ball a lot, are likely to keep their offensive schemes relatively unchanged.
“We’re not a team trying to throw the ball sixty times anyway. [Shampklin]’s going to get his carries, [Borguet]’s going to get his carries,” Watson explained. “We might be a little more run-centric, but I think we probably would have been like that anyway.”
If Harvard can come away with a win on Saturday, it would improve its all-time record in the series against Dartmouth to 72-41-5 going into a crucial matchup against Columbia on Nov. 6 in New York City. The Lions are also 5-1 after defeating Dartmouth on Oct. 22 and, along with Princeton, represent one of the Crimson’s biggest challengers for the Ivy League title. However, despite the opponents’ records, Watson insisted that he placed no special emphasis on these three opponents, instead choosing to approach his season one game at a time.
“Every team we play, they’ll definitely be formidable opponents,” he said. “So that’s how we’ve gotta come in, locked in, one week at a time, one practice at a time, one snap at a time. That’s our motto.”
The game will be televised on NESN, the second of three times this season that the Crimson will be broadcast locally. Its Nov. 23 matchup against Yale will be shown by ESPN Networks. Fans will also be able to catch Saturday’s game over the radio with WRCA (1330 AM, 106.1 FM) and WHRB (95.3 FM).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When most NCAA Division I men’s hockey programs returned to competition last winter, the Harvard men’s hockey team was forced to watch from afar.
Teams across the country grappled with travel restrictions, mask mandates, and other Covid-era policies while playing through the pandemic. By the end of the 2020-21 campaign though, the NCAA did manage to push through the season and crown the University of Massachusetts national champion.
But the Bright-Landry Hockey Center was dormant. Harvard — along with all other Ivy League teams — sat the pandemic-stricken season out, with its players scattered around the country as other ECAC teams competed for a conference title that would have been well within reach for the Crimson.
On Friday, the Crimson will return to the ice, ending an agonizing 19-month hiatus that marks the longest stretch without a game in the recent history of the program. No. 15/14 Harvard will open its season on the road with a conference matchup against Dartmouth at 8 p.m. at Thompson Arena.
Harvard recently claimed a 4-0 victory over the Big Green in a scrimmage on Oct. 16 in Cambridge. In the contest, the Crimson controlled the offensive flow of the game, mounting a 36-19 shots-on-goal advantage. Nonetheless, both teams will enter Friday’s season opener with clean records.
Moreover, after the exhibition loss to Harvard, Dartmouth went on to defeat reigning national champion No. 12/10 UMass, 3-2, in the Big Green’s second and final scrimmage, which also did not count but caught the attention of the Crimson. On Saturday, in game two of the young season, Harvard will return home to Bright-Landry to take on Bentley, who already has six games under its belt and a 3-3-0 record, with wins coming against Ohio State, Boston College, and Holy Cross.
“Everyone can beat everyone in college hockey, especially in our leagues, ECAC and Ivy,” co-captain and forward Casey Dornbach said. “Dartmouth and Bentley are solid teams, and Bentley's proven to beat some really good teams this year. Dartmouth just beat UMass, and yes, we came out with a [4-0 scrimmage] win, but we know they've notoriously been a team that is always tough to play against.”
This weekend’s slate will officially put an end to the preseason for Harvard, which also saw the Crimson defeat Brown 8-2 in its second exhibition game. With only one open weekend between today and finals period, Harvard will play 12 games between Oct. 29 and Dec. 4, eight of them coming in ECAC conference play. On the non-conference side, showdowns against Beanpot foes Northeastern and Boston College in November will headline Harvard’s first-half schedule.
“I think the energy around the team — and around campus, really, as a whole — has been really positive,” said longtime Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 this week. “I think the excitement to get started is about as high as it’s ever been just because, I think, there’s a greater appreciation for what we’ve missed.”
The Crimson will return a handful of its key players from two years ago, including defensemen Henry Thrun and forwards John Farinacci, Casey Dornbach, and Nick Abruzzese. But Ted Donato’s biggest task early in the 2021-22 season will be introducing much of his squad to D-I college hockey for the first time.
Harvard’s roster includes 14 players who have never worn a Crimson sweater — eight freshmen and six sophomores.
“I think it’s a challenge to make sure we come together as a team from a chemistry standpoint, just because we have two classes full of new guys and a bunch of guys that haven’t played with each other,” Donato said. “But I think early on here and preseason, the group has taken a lot of steps to come together.”
Despite the premature ending to its 2019-20 season, Harvard had good reason to be optimistic about the makeup of its roster going into the next winter. A strong veteran core that delivered 15 wins was set to return alongside a head-turning recruiting class. But after the Ivy League announced there would be no 2020-21 season, five players left the squad for pro hockey. And the Crimson’s top recruit, Matt Beniers, enrolled at the University of Michigan.
“We’re happy for those guys, and obviously everyone has a different path,” said Dornbach, who notched 36 points two winters ago. “For me, it was a no-brainer. I wanted to come back and be an older guy, as a senior.”
Highlighting the incoming class is first-year forward Matthew Coronato, who was selected by the Calgary Flames with the 13th overall pick in the 2021 NHL Draft. 13th overall set a new Harvard record for highest draft selection in program history and marks just the third time a Crimson player has gone in the first round.  Altogether, the Harvard roster will feature 11 NHL draft picks, and of the 11, six are newcomers this year: Coronato, defenseman Jack Bar, defenseman Kyle Aucoin, defenseman John Fusco, forward Alex Laferriere, and forward Sean Farrell. Nonetheless, despite newcomers’ credentials and backgrounds in top-tier junior leagues like the USHL, college hockey will present a new challenge.
“Anytime you go from one level to higher level there’s definitely an adjustment,” said Nick Abruzzese, a 5-foot-9 junior forward who was named the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year two winters ago.
But he added that he has “full confidence” the younger two classes are “going to be very impactful and key contributors on this team.”
“We’ve already seen a lot of growth from them,” he said. “In the [last] two months, a lot of guys have really grown and come out of their shell a little bit, and really done a good job of making sure that they’re up to speed.”
Abruzzese and Thrun, both juniors, were each named to the pre-season all-league team earlier this month. Harvard was picked to finish third in the ECAC preseason coaches poll, behind Quinnipiac and Clarkson.
On March 6-7, 2020, as the No. 5 seed in the ECAC Tournament, the Crimson defeated St. Lawrence, two games to none, in a best-of-three series to qualify for the conference quarterfinals. Before taking the ice for the win-or-go-home final eight, however, the Covid-19 campus shutdown and 601-day hiatus between games intervened. On the eve of a new season, the unsatisfying end to the last near-normal season has renewed the Crimson’s conviction to kick off the 2021-22 campaign.
“I think a lot of guys in the room feel that we have some unfinished business,” Thrun said. “As a group, we all want to get back together and continue playing. And for me, personally, I feel that I still have a long ways to go to develop.”

It's Halloweekend, have a bingo. :-)
Sections
Disclaimer: “Entire personality” may be a stretch. You may not sue The Crimson if you feel attacked by this list. 
It’s everybody’s favorite time of year: it’s socially acceptable to wear whatever you want in public, you’re encouraged to eat your body weight in candy, and there’s something scarier than any midterms or finals coming up in the air. That’s right. It’s Halloween. And since we can be anything, read on to discover what your choice of costume says about you.
Elaborate Group Costume
Maybe you and your blockmates just bought Squid Game tracksuits two weeks ago. Or maybe you’re going for something more established, like some assorted Avengers. Maybe you think you can turn the tides of pop culture by calling back to Among Us. No matter your reasoning, if you have a ton of people involved, you’re either desperate to make sure everybody gets your costume, too lazy to come up with individualized ones, or you’ve realized that sometimes, you need a group to truly bring the costume to life. It wouldn’t really be Squid Game if there was only one player, right? Perhaps I’ve said too much.
Something Bought/Made Months Ago
You’re definitely the kind of person who would plan their schedule around Monstober, the Disney Channel extravaganza. You’ve probably memorized at least three Halloween movies word for word and maybe even participated in costume contests in high school. In February, you start counting down the days to Halloween via your Instagram story. Other people might love Halloween, but you live it.
Animal Onesie
Others might find these lazy. Others might find them impractical or even lacking in creativity. You know the truth: they’re comfortable as heck. You won’t be able to hear the sound of your haters with your hood up. While they freeze the moment they step outside, you’ll be enjoying the soft fur of your onesie. You can probably even sleep in them! Author’s note: Please change after you get back.
Something Else Without a Pop Culture Reference
Maybe you’re going as a princess. Not anything from Disney, just a princess. Or maybe you’re going back to basics as a mummy or a witch. Either way, it’s not too hard to characterize you. You really couldn’t come up with a costume that has at least a little bit of relevance? You only get a pass if you’re matching with one of your little siblings brought from home. They have the excuse of not recognizing anything from the movies or Netflix. You, on the other hand, have some catching up to do.
Last Minute
So you decided to put on a baseball cap and declare that you’re Joe Goldberg. Or you had the brilliant idea of doing a little something something with your hair and going as X celebrity or politician. While others may see right through you, I know who you really are. Either you’re the most indecisive person in the world or you were only convinced to go to that Halloween party because you heard your Sleep section crush was going to be there. Just saying, people like folks who put more thought into their costumes. Some advice if you ever do shoot your shot.
No Costume
You’re either a pre-med with an Orgo midterm on Monday or someone who doesn’t like to have fun. Either way, there’s not much I can do to help you. Good luck!
And with the rest of Flyby, I would like to wish you a spooky and eventful Halloween, especially if the real scary stuff (aka your midterms) is already behind you!
