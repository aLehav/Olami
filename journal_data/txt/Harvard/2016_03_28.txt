After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although their fans may have been covered in glitter left over from queercore opening act PWR BTTM, do not let the whimsy deceive you: Ra Ra Riot has done a lot of growing up since its founding 10 years ago at Syracuse University. The crowd that assembled at Paradise Rock Club on a frigid Boston night looked like it could well have grown up with the band, and indeed its members’ excitement was as palpable as that of a young child waiting to enter a Bouncy Castle.
Their 10th anniversary is clearly a time of reflection for Ra Ra Riot, and in an introspective Tumblr post this January they wondered internet-aloud: “Are we old? Are we young? Are we silvering warhorses galloping over-the-hill, our minds and bodies beginning to succumb to time’s ceaseless progression (likely), or are we just now on the verge of our band’s pubescence, ready to plow headlong into a decade of hormonal turmoil and regrettable experiments in fashion?” The twenty-somethings in the crowd could clearly relate to these questions as much as their something-teen selves related to an adolescent Ra Ra Riot’s lyrical themes of love in a time of uncertainty. The fact that this post was published on a medium most often frequented by angsty 16-year-old girls should in no way invalidate the sincerity of its content.
While its members no longer look like they have a 50/50 shot at getting carded at R-rated movies, Ra Ra Riot has clearly maintained the dynamic onstage presence that originally made it famous, trading manic for mature and self-conscious for self-aware without sacrificing authenticity. “We still got a lot of nervous energy up on the stage here tonight. This is only the second show of our first real tour in two and a half years,” lead singer Wes Miles said. Feeding off each other's’ enthusiasm, bandmates exchanged smiles throughout the performance that felt at once ironic and intimate.
Anybody with doubts about Miles’s vocal abilities needed to listen no further than the first few bars of opening song “Binary Mind.” The upbeat rendition showcased his pleading falsetto with a clarity that did not falter for the remainder of the performance. Bassist Mathieu Santos stood to his side sporting a Bruins jersey, which was the only thing distinguishing his onstage aesthetic from that of an early Rivers Cuomo. Flanking him on the other side was Rebecca Zeller, whose sparkly violin caught the physical spotlight as much as her impressive musical skills caught the metaphorical one. Fortunately, despite recently adding more synth and percussion to its sound, Ra Ra Riot has not altogether forsaken the creatively complex string-filled arrangements that characterized its earlier songs. Miles’s tambourine was a nice touch but didn’t overwhelm Zeller’s ability to play a dainty instrument while looking utterly badass.
About midway through the show, Miles said, “We’re gonna do something a little different here. Something we haven’t done before.” Donning glasses, an acoustic guitar, and an even more earnest expression (if that’s possible), he launched into an acoustic version of “Bad Times” that was poignant and delightful and served as a surprisingly pleasant change of pace. The subsequent transition from this song’s darker lyrics to the simple brightness of older hit “Dance With Me” kept the mood as positive as their blog post’s plea-promise to “just come, it’s going to be a blast.”
Although Ra Ra Riot was careful to intersperse its new material with several of its more well-known tracks, the audience’s dedication to the band was evident when they consistently and confidently sung the lyrics to songs released only days before on Feb. 19.
As the show came to a close, Miles once again waxed meditative. “It’s been quite a whirlwind,” he said, “but we’re feeling pretty amazing right now…. Thanks for singing along. It feels so good.” Despite getting temporarily confused and trying to walk off stage with two songs left to play, Miles made up for it with an agile kick-jump that punctuated his farewell wishes: “Hope you guys had as much fun as we did. Take it easy.”
Melodically imploring, “Don’t punish me for what I feel,” Miles ended the show with “Water,” the first song off of new album “Need Your Light.” This was a fitting end to a performance that demonstrated that Ra Ra Riot is proud of where it’s been, excited for where it’s going, and rightfully unapologetic for any musical changes its maturation has brought. Fans need not fear that this stage represents the end of the band’s graceful evolution, however. If their statement that “we’re just getting started, and we’ve still got a lot to learn,” is any indication of future developments, there are many more impassioned encores and songs about Bouncy Castles still to come.

Even geniuses can lose their knack. In the history of pop music, numerous prodigies who had perfected a stunning original sound at a very early stage eventually came to struggle with innovation when their past achievements became a burden. Unfortunately, this fate now befalls none other than the godfather of punk himself. In his newest album, “Post Pop Depression,” Iggy Pop tries to reinvigorate his late-’70s sound by recruiting Josh Homme of Queens of The Stone Age as producer. But despite snippets of brilliance, the experiment sounds like a forced innovation and fails to impress.
To be fair, Iggy has never lacked innovative spirit. From his debut with The Stooges to his collaborations with David Bowie to his independent projects, he has consistently added new elements to his rough, direct, impassioned style. In his last two albums, he took a surprising turn towards exploring French jazz and gave new interpretations to classics like “Les Feuilles Mortes.” In contrast, “Post Pop Depression” is much more similar to Iggy’s earlier works, especially 1977’s Bowie-produced “The Idiot.” Both albums are collaborations, and both combine the rawness of Pop’s voice with thick layers of sound, the former even paying tribute to the Berlin-recorded latter with a song titled “German Days.”
However, almost 40 years later, “Post Pop Depression” sounds more like a B-side to “The Idiot” than an improvement upon it. To begin with, Homme is no Bowie. He has simply copied the Queens of The Stone Age’s style and pasted it beneath Iggy’s voice with virtually no modification including the harsh, repetitive guitar riff, the thick bass line, and the fast, restless drumbeats. Hearing these musical qualities in an Iggy Pop album is refreshing but not necessarily compelling, since they do not always work well with Iggy’s hoarse, nasal voice. Moreover, the album lacks interesting melodies to balance out the simplistic instrumentals. Tracks like “Gardenia” and “Break Into Your Heart” are catchy but far from powerful or even impressive. Songs like “American Valhalla” and “Vulture” do not have compelling tunes and rely on uninspired attempts at stylistic innovation to sound interesting, to poor effect.
“Sunday,” the third single from the album, is a good representative of the LP’s overall mediocrity. It opens with standard Queens of The Stone Age-style drumbeats and a simple guitar riff; Pop joins in soon after with generic lyrics about the tedious working class life. After a tiresome chorus, the backing vocal contributes a repetitive phrase in a style so run-of-the-mill that the track sounds like any one of the sloppily produced pop songs played in grocery stores. Even a brilliant guitar solo from Homme cannot save the song from being a letdown.
The last song, “Paraguay,” sweeps away the prior disappointment with anger, earnestness, and raw energy. More than anything, it takes away the distracting guitar and bass riffs and brings back an Iggy Pop who sounds eager, intimate, forthright and powerful—all the qualities that make him a great rocker. The first part of the song is both poetic and epic, and in the second part Pop directly shouts out to the audience with great anxiety, as if he himself is annoyed by the quality of the album. “There's nothing awesome here / Not a damn thing,” he begins, eventually escalating to “You take your motherfucking laptop / And just shove it into your goddamn foul mouth.” The provocative pronouncement ends with Pop almost losing his voice as he screams, “And I'm gonna go heal myself now, yeah!” Then—no riff, no backing vocal, just a neat, clean end.
During “Paraguay”, Pop becomes once again the madman who writes songs with urgent messages and sings them with raw power. Unfortunately, such unrestrained brilliance lasts for only those six minutes.

“The Swimmer” is the tenth volume of poetry from University of Wisconsin—Milwaukee Philosophy professor John Koethe, otherwise commonly known as the "Philosopher poet.” Alternately wry and somber, colloquial and lyrical, moving and purposefully vain, the collection can be read on the whole as a portrait of Koethe’s loss of belief in the effectiveness of poetic representation. This argument ultimately highlights for the reader an emptiness that lurks behind Koethe’s highly stylized poetics and profoundly anti-philosophical philosophizing.
In three successive sections that move from the figurative to the directly philosophical, Koethe’s collection demonstrates a gradual shift away from representative poetry. The first part of “The Swimmer” is riddled with image and allegory—Frank Sinatra's childhood train set, a Japanese pot, and household cats. In the last poem of the section, "Dorothy Dean," Koethe presents the literal destruction of representation, with the image of a painting in magic marker that gradually fades to nothing. In the brief second section of “The Swimmer,” there is a further remove from the figurative: Two poems detail historical events, and one, "In the Louvre," rejects the representational paintings displayed at the museum as "strange icons/Of a 'madness to explain' an unfamiliar world that passeth understanding." In the third part, Koethe finally moves almost entirely out of the realm of imagery and towards philosophy describing the poetic process. This shift would be more interesting if it included the presentation of some problem or failure of representation; instead[COMMA] Koethe’s central “philosophical” argument appears to be that there is nothing to represent. In "Early April in the Country," Koethe looks at "indifferent cows" in the distance and thinks back ironically on his "first 'grand' poem," in which he described " '. . . the copper-, cream-, and chocolate-colored/Cows."  "[The poems] flowed," he remembers, "they had too many words, they were/Driven by a ‘madness to explain’ that feels quaint now,/As though there were nothing to explain anymore."
For a poet who seems to argue the pointlessness of representation, Koethe is fastidious in his presentation of his unique style and voice. He writes, with one or two exceptions, in long-line free form verse with a strong rhetorical force that propels the reader forward—even through moments of poignancy or abstraction where he or she may want to slow down. There are instances of almost Keatsian spontaneity and comfortable lack of clarity, as Koethe simultaneously develops and formulates his thoughts: "it's written in a different idiom, full of sound and fury,/Signifying—what? It can't be nothing, though it might as well be/If it can't be rendered in the language of the stars." Unlike Keats, however, Koethe seems to incorporate this technique consciously as an element of his style.  Koethe’s poems are further crowded with encoded and explicit references to other works, from Wordsworth to Keats to Shakespeare to Jack Nicholson in "Chinatown;" he even begins many poems with a citation. These references inform the reader of the history of artistic creation that inspires and replaces Koethe’s own poetic voice and provide refreshing and rich material, but are finally superficial.
“The Swimmer” additionally calls attention to its form by way of an overwhelming self-consciousness that finally distances both Koethe’s own poetic voice and the reader from his work. The frequency with which the poet comments on his own style ("insouciance with a slight/Heightening at the end, as if Thomas Hardy were sipping a Martini") and content ("The beauty is what's left. It doesn't make any sense, but there it is.") give the sense that as it is being created, his poetry is under constant and careful observation.  This built-in distance from the work results in a sense of emptiness throughout that Koethe himself, unsurprisingly, comments on: It is "imagination/Anchored in style"—"What isn't/There is the life between the words, the life that existed/Beyond the words."  Koethe's self-diagnosis rings true: While the poems in “The Swimmer” are beautifully crafted, like all six of the navy blue Brooks Brothers suits that the speaker in one poem admits to having bought, at times the reader is hard-pressed to find "life between [or even within] the words."

Like many people, I spent spring break as productively as possible: Binge-watching Netflix. "House of Cards" recovered from a lackluster season 3 with a vengeance, the Punisher was the best thing to happen to "Daredevil," and I finally started "Cowboy Bebop"…before I switched to the new season of "Daredevil" when it came out.
This isn’t to state that I like the latter significantly more than the former (and in fact, I think both are really good). Rather, "Daredevil," "Orange is the New Black," "Game of Thrones," and other massive television shows have become cultural touchstones, making them popular subjects of analysis, conversation, and enjoyment across society. It’s not hard to see why: With streaming services cutting into the market of television corporations, the two have battled for revenue by acquiring, creating, and broadcasting high-quality television exclusively on their own platforms. This competition has given us an era of “peak T.V.” where it’s tempting to lock ourselves up in a bunker to watch it all.
But even if we wanted to watch all this great television, there are only so many hours in a day, limiting the amount of television it’s possible to watch or invest in. It makes sense then to focus on the most culturally salient shows. Life as a young adult in a big city is now better encapsulated by "Girls" and "Broad City" than by "Sex in the City"; "House of Cards" better depicts the public’s current opinion of the political system than "Veep" or "The West Wing"; other examples abound. Put simply, pop culture reflects and reveals popular beliefs.
While this means that pop culture might be a good way to initially connect with someone, popular art—be it music, books, or television—rarely deal with less widely shared and widely discussed aspects of ourselves. Pop culture, and discussions about it, largely riffs­ on the same few themes, limiting the scope of what can be talked about. There are only so many ways to react to the archetypical "Breaking Bad"; even if someone articulates what they took away from the experience, there is a high chance you will have already heard that takeaway before—regardless of whether or not you’ve actually seen it.
Why settle for only discussing art that you and everyone you know are going to spend a Sunday watching in your pajamas? At some point, all of us have found art that has spoken to us on a personal level; sharing art or television in that category with those whom we want to know us better can be so much more valuable than simply discussing what’s popular again and again. For example, while we all enjoy pop music to an extent, we bond more deeply over personally significant music; an album or even a single can communicate volumes about a person’s values, goals, and experiences, and even if another listener doesn’t glean the same meaning, the cost of sharing is essentially non-existent.
With its ability to spin complex narratives, television, novels, and films have the potential to communicate even more about us than just one song. On the other hand, the cost of failing to bond over this art—wasting time—may appear steep enough to seem dissuasive, but it’s still possible to reduce the necessary commitment and introduce someone to a personal touchstone. Rather than showing someone an entire series and telling them why you like it, you can recommend your favorite episode—or favorite episodes—and discuss how it crystallizes the personal significance of the work as a whole. In addition to mitigating the potential cost of time wasted, there is value in being able to concisely articulate why pieces of art are significant to you. Even if you don’t ultimately share your takeaways, you gain self-knowledge from recognizing how and why that art matters to you.
Great popular art speaks to us because it illustrates the current zeitgeist, but personal art speaks to us because it illuminates our own experience. Sharing such art may take work—it might even be scary—but using it to communicate that experience to close friends can ultimately be more validating.

In a sweeping step backwards, North Carolina’s state government passed a law last week that strips basic rights from transgender Americans, highlighting the discrimination the BGLTQ community continues to face in the United States. The law, approved during a special legislative session that cost $42,000, prevents municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination measures based on gender identity or sexual orientation and forces transgender men and women to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to the gender listed on their birth certificates, rather than the one with which they identify.
At its root, this law is a fundamental violation of the universal right to safe restrooms that deserves the swift condemnation it has received. Unfortunately, such discriminatory measures are far from unique. BGLTQ rights remain consistently under attack, and we write in solidarity not only with the BGLTQ people in North Carolina but also with all members of this population whose rights are being infringed upon. Transgender people already face alarmingly high rates of violence, and this law only stands to put them at greater risk of mistreatment.
This piece of legislation in North Carolina came less than a week after the gender-neutral sign on a single-stall restroom was vandalized in Eliot House. While the incident at Harvard was far less severe, it should serve as a reminder that such misguided intolerance can lurk under the surface of many communities.
North Carolina’s bill is the inevitable product of continued blindness to the normalization of bigotry around transgender people. Marriage equality was only a long-overdue step in support of BGLTQ rights, but it is incumbent upon people who recognize and denounce transphobia in their own communities to strive to continue effecting change through the political process.
After all, while it may be easier to ignore or dismiss events like the destruction of one sign in front of a restroom as isolated and insignificant, that narrative is not reflected by a world in which state legislatures pass overtly discriminatory bills by overwhelming majorities. Unfortunately, even Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has so far refused to endorse a bill aimed at preventing discrimination against transgender citizens in our own state, which has some gaps in its current civil rights legislation.  It is time that we listen to these concerns and actively fight to preserve BGLTQ rights both in our immediate communities and in the larger political system. We urge North Carolinians and all Americans to fight against this discriminatory bill, and to continue to fight similar intolerance in all its manifestations.

In tenth grade, I heard from some poet that real emotions were complicated, and since I was cheesy as hell, I believed it before I believed anything else—even the easy things, like that my parents actually loved me or skin and water were made of the same stuff. There’s a section in Sheila Heti’s "How Should A Person Be?" where she talks about personality as a social construct—how you can look like you have a soul—and while the rest of my fiction-writing class said “I remember thinking like that” I was thinking, I think like that now. I think I’ll live to 100. I’m less than a quarter of the way in this life thing. I think there’s a bit of poetry in everything, which means there are double meanings and mistakes, line breaks and metaphors. I’m too old to crave poetry. I’m too young to be fascinated. But I still want to know what it means for a phrase like “take care” to lilt the way it does. To understate or overstate.
The first time I took a fiction writing class, I was surprised by how many systems it took to make falseness believable, how many differences there were in being real and pretending to be real. I questioned anything that cut too perfectly, that ended with someone being just right. I hated characters that grew to be functional rather than deep, that were able to say how exactly they became better people. They were formulaic. They sang clichés.
I wanted characters that messed with darkness until they hardened, that hurt when they loved. I wanted my narrators unreliable. I wanted them to say they were happy when they weren’t and to beg, plead for your pity when they didn’t deserve it. I wanted my dialogue raw. I wanted monologues littered with the kind of brutal slang that did not care. I wanted lowercase instead of capitals and sentences longer than breath. I wanted language that ripped. I thought everything I wanted in a story illustrated complicated people that surrounded me. I thought I loved writing fiction because it was so real, because it felt like life.
The first thing my teacher told me was that there were differences between characters and real people. Characters wanted tangible things like money and girls named Sarah, while real people wanted fluffy things, like love or a purpose in the world. Characters thrived on making things as inconvenient as possible, on self-destructing until they fell to near nothing; real people self-preserved. Characters were placed in situations where the “why this/why now?” question was easy to answer; real people meandered pointlessly. This classical dichotomy: It made sense. The fake had to work harder to be real. They needed conflict, tragedy, complexity. They needed life more than the rest of us, the real people, did.
How do you reconcile the people in your head with the people in your life, the people of your memory with those of your present? What does it mean, to be interesting enough to have your own story? It’s no wonder that Heti, a young female writer, writes so much about how to construct yourself, when, in fiction, the fake “you” you’ve constructed seems more real, more purposeful, than the real you. But I wonder how much we fictionalize ourselves, how much we need to deceive ourselves in order to do so. How common, how practical it is to be the hero of your own story?
I learned in a neuroscience class that you don’t remember things; you remember remembering things. The music pounding sideways in your car. The break in your throat. You choose how to remember it. You choose the way it fits into yourself. And in this process, the memory becomes a little false, a little off. It seems more real than real. It works to make you feel. It works like fiction.
When my mother and my father and my sister drove to Massachusetts for the first time since Christmas, I saw Cambridge as the pretty town it is and the open iron gates cool and neutral as a close-to-touch promise. It was negative 25 degrees, and the night before, I told them to bring jackets on jackets on jackets, and while my sister laughed and said I was lying, I told her I wasn’t. They picked me up at four in the afternoon in our silver Acura. My mother and my father and my sister and I tried on conversations that fell through the restaurant’s swing, and when we left, it was too cold to talk. In their hotel room, I slept next to my mother. Her body firmed against mine before it smoothed, and I held her hand so each ridge tucked tight against mine. I wondered what it meant to touch, to know someone was real. The next day we waited in a bad Chinese restaurant for brunch. We tried conversation, but it was sloppy. My parents dropped me off at Widener Gate. “Take care!” my mother said when I opened the car door. “Take care!” I said back.
“Take care!” my English teacher said when she saw me at graduation, diploma in hand and ankles silver in heels.
“Take care!” one night stands in movies said to each other when they planned on leaving forever.
“Take care!” I said to subway acquaintances, dog owners, waiters that stuttered when reciting specials.
“Take care!” we said to those fleeting people, before the cute good-byes. But my mother said it to me too cheerfully to mean it. She said it in place of what she’d wanted to say.
I wanted to tell her about the Was and the Is in me. I wanted to say that it had taken me this long to realize that all this time I’d been listening and agreeing, listening and agreeing, that it had taken me this long to realize she was right. Yes, love can really be this simple. Oh yes, it really can.

To the Crimson Editors:
As a former Master of Winthrop House (2003-9), I read with great interest the op-ed by Robert Proctor, “The Unsung  Story of Diversity at Harvard.” I was proud of Winthrop House then and I am just as proud of it now. My pride moves me to record two observations that may be of interest to historians of the House.
Current Winthrop House dominance of the Straus Cup began in 2007-2008, when an Australian economics resident tutor, Anthony Niblett, inspired the undergraduates and the tutors to show up for intramurals. At a dinner at the end of the year, a senior asked everyone, "Who here has done at least one IM event?” Nearly everyone raised a hand, including my wife and I. Winthrop House went from last place to first place and stayed there.
Mr. Proctor makes reference to a 2008-9 photo of Winthrop House tutors and staff that includes the “sole African American building manager.” He has a name. He was David Simms, Buster to his friends and family. He gave over 30 years of his life to Winthrop House before passing away on the job, and he was a far more important and loved figure in the House than I was. He was a friend to me, and I believe I was a friend to him.  He wanted to be in that picture, and I am honored to be in it with him.

Stephen Peter Rosen '74 is Harvard College Professor and Beton Michael Kaneb Professor of National Security and Military Affairs in the Department of Government. He was master of Winthrop House from 2003-2009.

Sick of the patriarchy? Got quadded on Housing Day? Scared Donald Trump will become our next president? Whatever the issue at hand might be, staging a revolution obviously needs a soundtrack. Listen to these tunes while you read this week’s scrutiny. John Reed would approve.
1. "Revolution" by The Beatles
Though attentive listeners may notice that this song is somewhat ambivalent towards revolutionaries, The Crimson is contractually obligated to include this song in any “revolution music” themed listicle. Here’s looking at you, SONY/ATV Music Publishing.
2. "Do You Hear the People Sing?" by Les Miserables Cast
The song’s inspiring lyrics are buoyed by France’s complete inability to suppress revolution. Five republics in 200 years? Really, France?
3. "Viva La Vida" by Coldplay
Who knew this song was even about a revolution? Not me, that’s for sure. But, really, what’s more revolutionary than a vaguely whiney male vocals? Personally, I hear this song and flashback to the middle school awkward days of braces and rocking out to 2008 pop music behind the closed door of my bedroom.
4. "Talkin’ Bout a Revolution" by Tracy Chapman
This song has the word “revolution” in the title! Check it out!
5. "Get Up Stand Up" by Bob Marley
Figured I’d spice things up a bit with a little reggae. This is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head and NEVER leaves—probably because the only words anyone knows are “get up” and “stand up.”
6. "(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)" by Beastie Boys
Revolution can take many forms (and parentheticals).
7. "Red" by Taylor Swift

Students and scholars across several departments gathered around a “vampirian round table” on Friday to discuss the importance of supernatural elements in media and literature in understanding society’s age-old thirst for tales of the undead.
Panelists covered a bevy of metaphysical topics, such as the roles of bloodlust, sexual repression, and psycho violence in dissecting the human psyche.
Around 25 people attended “Vampire Vibes: The Dark Side of Modern Culture” in the Barker Center. The event was held in collaboration with the course German 170 “Biopolitics and the Vampire Aesthetics, 1716-2016,” according to course head and conference organizer  Nicole A. Sütterlin.
The course aims to introduce students to the theory of “biopolitics,” or the idea that institutions like schools, hospitals, and prisons have an increasing amount of control over how we think and live. Sütterlin sees the course literature as being particularly relevant to contemporary issues like surveillance and medical records.
“We are constantly under surveillance when you go to the doctor,” she said. “Of course it’s in your interest that these documents are kept, but at the same time it is known that once these documents are there, they are not in your hands.”
For Caroline T. Diep ’19, the class is a way to explore the intersection of various disciplines such as psychology, religion, media revolutions, and territorial and political boundaries, through the motif of vampires in literature.
“When I was looking for classes, I wanted to take a class I could sink my teeth into and that would expose me to a culture and topic outside my comfort zone,” Diep said.
Margaret M. Irving ’17, an anthropology concentrator, presented her research on the vampire series “Twilight” and the rise of social media. Irving hoped to uncover the sociological implications of the past popular obsession with the series.
“The panel was incredibly thought-provoking and enjoyable,” Irving said. “It was amazing to have the opportunity to interact with faculty from Harvard and beyond, and learn more about the many ways vampirism can be studied and analyzed.”
Keynote speaker Professor Laurence A. Rickels of the Karlsruhe Academy of Visual Arts spoke of the sometimes-hidden Freudian insights into society’s fascination with vampires in his panel “All You Vampires.”
When describing the appeal of portraying the vampire in mass-media, he posited that elements of the undead are unavoidable in everyday life.
According to Rickels, “the true vampire is in the news, in foreign affairs, at home, and sometimes even in us.”

After making it  to the round of 16, a Harvard video game squad was booted from their tournament for cheating.
A group of Harvard video game players competing in the Blizzard Entertainment’s "Heroes of the Dorm" competition—a multiplayer online video game—was disqualified last week for violating several of the contest’s rules.
An investigation by tournament officials revealed a player on the Harvard team, called Team Ambush, was sharing his user account with a higher rated player who was not on the team's official tournament roster.
“We have a zero tolerance for cheating in our tournaments,” Blizzard Entertainment said in a press release posted on its website. “The rules are in place to ensure a fair playing field for all participants—when these rules are abused, they put the integrity of the competition at risk.”
The team issued an apology and said that after the qualifiers, both a team member and the team’s substitute were unable to participate because of what they called an unavoidable lack of Internet access. Andy Kim ’17, co-president of the Harvard College eSports Association, under whose purview Team Ambush falls, declined to provide names of players on the team and said they wished to “remain out of the spotlight for a bit.”
“We were uncertain about how to continue, since we really wanted to continue participating in this event and did not want to forfeit by not having enough players for the first weekend in bracket play, which we had worked hard to achieve,” the team wrote in an open letter on the post-sharing platform Medium.
With the illegal substitute, Harvard had defeated a team from University of California at Berkeley in the first round, and Indiana-Purdue in the round of 32. Afterwards, the team from UC Berkeley, last year’s tournament champions, was allowed to take Harvard’s vacated spot in the “Super Sixteen.”
Kim said the team’s punishment was justified.
“I think that the player did definitely screw up. There’s no other way to say it than that they simply cheated,” Kim wrote in an email. “They went against the rules. And they have been rightly punished for it.”
Kim added that the eSports association has a decentralized structure, in which individual teams manage themselves, though he said in the future his organization hopes to have a more “systematic approach to drafting and managing” the various teams.
Kim added that the association will seek to ensure similar incidents do not occur in the future.
“As individuals who should have been fully aware not only of the rules of the tournament but also of the moral implications of our actions and their effects on others, we recognize that we have committed a grave error and can only ask for forgiveness,” he wrote.
The college tournament, in which teams of five match off in the multiplayer online battle arena “Heroes of the Storm,” began on Feb. 20 with an online qualifier that extended through March 6, after which the initial field of 120 narrowed to just 64.
The disqualification is the second of tournament, following the discipline of a team from Michigan University for a similar case. A number of media outlets seized on the story, including ESPN and the Boston Globe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators acknowledged diversifying the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is still a work in progress at a town hall last Friday.
“Like our own nation and society, our aspirations run ahead of our reality,” said Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who fielded questions from undergraduates about administrative plans to ensure the Faculty’s hiring process considers diverse candidates along with FAS Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser.
In recent months, students across the University have called for more diversity within their respective faculties, emphasizing more generally the need for better treatment of minorities on campus. Zipser herself has decried attrition rates of female faculty members, in particular.
At the town hall, which a handful of undergraduates and administrators attended, several students expressed concern at the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the Mathematics and Statistics Departments. Others added minority and women tenure-track faculty members often face additional burdens that could take time away from their own research. Such burdens include mentoring many undergraduates and serving on more departmental committees than their colleagues.
In response, Zipser suggested FAS should consider mentorship of undergraduates and graduates more formally as part of a “service” component in the tenure recommendation process. In addition, she said FAS administrators are attempting to diversify the Mathematics Department faculty, which has no senior female faculty.
One professor, Sophie Morel, left the department for Princeton a few years after she became the first female tenured math professor at Harvard in 2009. At the townhall, Zipser said Harvard has offered professorships to two women, including Stanford’s Maryam Mirzakhani, the first female recipient of the Fields Medal.
“What we’re trying to do is make sure that [Mathematics is] hiring the most outstanding candidates, which we believe would include women and minorities,” Zipser, who received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard in 2000, said. “I believe they think they need to change too, so I think they are wholeheartedly on board with change, and now we just need to have some success.”
Zipser also said her office has considered “cluster hiring”—or hiring small groups of minority and women candidates—especially in fields where such groups are underrepresented significantly.
Friday’s forum was the most recent of several town hall meetings Khurana has hosted since last November, when a College working group published a report calling for increased diversification in Faculty and administrative bodies on campus, among other recommendations.
“Harvard’s administration, faculty, and staff, however, continue to lag behind in terms of diversity,” the report concluded. “This lack of diversity frustrates Harvard’s efforts to foster a campus environment that diminishes cultural and structural cues of exclusion, minimizes stereotype threats, and provides students from varying backgrounds equal opportunities to succeed in concentrations throughout the arts and sciences.”
After the town hall, Director of the Harvard Foundation S. Allen Counter said he appreciates what he considers increased efforts to diversify the Faculty.
“I do hope the University will make a concerted effort to reach out to other schools and recruit,” Counter said, adding that the refocused commitment to diversity is “such an improvement from what it used to be.”
Undergraduate Council Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who attended the town hall, said underrepresented students also would appreciate the role models and mentors that a more diverse Faculty could provide.
“If I am female, or of another underrepresented minority or ethnicity, sometimes it’s important for me to see other folks who are like me, and that have my shared experience, who are doing well and doing what I want to do,” Greenlaw said. He suggested Harvard could publicize new faculty appointments to highlight for students its commitment diversity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of the Harvard Art Museums’ indigenous film series, a crowd of about 40 gathered Sunday to watch the film “Samson and Delilah,” which chronicles the lives of two native Australian teenagers living in poverty.
The film, made by indigenous filmmaker Warwick Thornton, follows the two title characters surviving through addiction and abuse in their small town in central Australia.
“You get a glimpse of their life which is so different from ours,” Cambridge resident Elona Hart said after watching the film. Hart added that she had heard of the movie when it came out, but had not yet had an opportunity to see it.
Cambridge resident Michael Hart said the large lack of spoken word in the film helped increase the emotional register of the work.
“I think that the fact that there were so few words helped to focus on what was important to feel,” he said. “I feel like the words would have really gotten in the way.  They did a nice job in that respect.”
“I think the film was complicated.  Part of it was not so easy to understand, but I think it’s a great topic,” Revathi Ananthakrishnan, another attendant at the event, said.
Jessica L. Martinez, the organizer of the event and Director of Academic and Public Programs at Harvard Art Museums, said she was excited to witness attendees mingling at the end of the event and sharing their own thoughts.
“I think what’s so terrific is… a lot of people really wanted to stay after the film and share their experiences,” Martinez said.
The Harvard Art Museums showed the film in Menschel Hall free of admission as part of its series “Together, Alone: Indigenous Film Now.”
Martinez said the name of the series is important. Referencing the title, she said, “That word ‘Now’ was so important to us.  We really wanted to present film mostly by indigenous directors from Australia over the last 20 years.”
The film series, which is co-sponsored by the Harvard University Native American Program, aims to display the ways in which indigenous filmmakers have added to and changed cinema.  It also hopes to convey to its audience how indigenous people have helped non-indigenous film directors portray indigenous stories more accurately and respectfully.
This film series has occurred alongside the special exhibition “Everywhen: The Eternal Present in Indigenous Art from Australia,” which displays indigenous art of Australia in the Harvard Art Museums.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard graduate student union effort formally launched the campaign “Working for a Healthy Harvard” last Wednesday in order to promote visibility for the issues graduate students face and to drum up support for their movement to unionize.
Union organizers have asked graduate students to fill out blank sheets of paper, which they call “white boards,” with their vision for a “healthy Harvard.”
“Things like literal healthcare are one of the first things that comes to mind when people talk about why they want to unionize,” Ph.D. candidate and union effort organizer Abigail Weil said. “But a healthy workplace has so many different aspects: intellectual support, emotional support, social wellbeing.”
This campaign will culminate in an event on April 28—about a year after the unionization effort went public—when organizers will present the different concerns of the graduate student body and officially ask Harvard to pledge neutrality in the process of calling for an election. The movement, called Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, announced last month that a majority of graduate students have signed authorization cards in support of unionization.
Harvard and peer institutions filed an amicus brief against graduate student unionization earlier this month, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences administration remains in firm opposition. Organizers and GSAS administrators await a National Labor Relations Board decision that could force private institutions to recognize graduate student unions.
Christine Mitchell, a graduate student who is collecting white boards at the School of Public Health, said she has seen answers ranging from single words and short phrases, such as “diversity” or “dental insurance,” to full paragraphs.
“This isn’t highlighting individual issues that single graduate students have, it’s about showing that these issues that we face are common amongst all,” union effort spokesperson and graduate student Jack M. Nicoludis said.
Weil said the campaign has been active all semester, but that organizers were waiting until they had collected several hundred sheets before formally launching the social media campaign on the HGSU-UAW website.
On Friday, organizers met in the Barker Center with a stack of white boards. Weil said that in the absence of an office or official meeting location, organizers have branched out to different cafes and open spaces across campus in an attempt to reach more students.
“It’s more of a guerilla approach,” Weil said, laughing. “Inclusivity and visibility, that’s the name of the game.”
Organizers said they have seen phrases about diversity, civil rights, and inclusivity on many white boards. The HGSU-UAW held its first Civil Rights Committee meeting in February, committee member and graduate student Felix Owusu said.
Owusu said that issues surrounding diversity have come to the forefront of the conversation.
“This pipeline issue sort of bubbles to the top as one thing that lots of lots of people, regardless of where they stood on unionization, thought was a problem,” Owusu said.
The committee will hold its first public “speak out” event on April 1, a protest focused on diversity and civil rights outside of Massachusetts Hall called “Stop the Leaky Pipeline.”

Since 2006, Concilio Latino, a campus Latino and Latin American cultural organization, has hosted a holiday dinner each year in early December. Last December, members of the organization approached the Undergraduate Council for funding for the event. The group had received funding in previous years for the dinner from the College's student government, which doles out more than $300,000 in grants annually.
According to Concilio Latino co-chair Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, UC representatives raised no objections to the funding during the group’s grant interview with the Council’s Finance Committee. The Finance Committee initially suggested that Concilio Latino would receive $850 pending a vote of the whole Council.
A club board member paid for the event’s expenses on a credit card with the expectation that the UC would reimburse the cost, Vasquez-Rodriguez said.
However, on Dec. 5, three days before the event, the organization received an email from the UC denying them funding because the event would take place during reading period, according to Vasquez-Rodriguez. Finance Committee rules prohibit the UC from funding events during shopping, reading, or exam periods.
This semester, the organization brought the issue up with the Finance Committee and asked to be reimbursed.
“Theoretically, they should have read the policy guide and known not to apply,” Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said during a committee meeting in February. “But it seems slightly different when they come to us at the grant meeting and we tell them they can get [the funds].”
The Finance Committee ultimately voted 8-0 to reimburse Concilio Latino for the event, with committee member Evan M. Bonsall ’19 arguing that “organizations should not have to pay for a mistake we made as the Finance Committee.”
The resolution is just one point in a larger discussion within the Finance Committee regarding how to improve communication between the UC and the student body, during a time in which transparency of the UC's financing decisions has come under scrutiny.
This semester, the UC published Finance Committee transactions dating back to fall 2011. And in an effort to inform club leaders of the Finance Committee’s 18-page long list of rules, which dictate funding on anything from film screening licences to board retreats, Greenlaw added all club treasurers to a central email list.
“Historically, Ficom has largely been a glorified savings account,” Greenlaw said during a committee meeting. “I’m interested in changing that.”
A LACK OF AWARENESS
Each fiscal year, the UC allocates approximately $300,000 to its grants budget, which the Finance Committee then distributes to student organizations based on its funding policy guide.
The grants budget and the budgets of several other UC committees are funded by a $75 UC Student Activities Fee that appears on all undergraduate students’ term bills each year. Students may waive the fee, but only by sending a physical letter to the Harvard Student Accounts Office requesting a waiver. Some students say they did not know the fee, or the waiver, even existed.
Beyond information about the UC fee, many students and organizations alike say they lack knowledge regarding the rules for Finance Committee grants, despite the information’s public availability on the UC website. Student organizations hoping to receive funding from the Council must submit a grant request proposal to the Finance Committee, and then attend an in-person interview with UC representatives, before receiving funding.
The Finance Committee largely relies on its policy guide to determine how much to allocate in funding. To many students, the rules are not immediately intuitive: publications can only receive up to $500 per semester, costumes are eligible for $1,000 per calendar year only if they are reusable in future performances, and DJ’s can be paid at most $150 per event.
This semester alone, two organizations so far have requested UC funding for their club’s website, only to be promptly denied during their grant interviews. Rule 35 of the Finance Committee’s policy guide states that the UC generally will not fund student organization websites, instead suggesting that organizations apply for a website through the Harvard Computer Society. 
Similarly, two organizations this academic year have also requested grants for holding fundraisers, despite the UC’s explicit rule against funding such events.
Thomas A. Lee ’19, who became treasurer for Harvard-Radcliffe Music in Hospitals and Nursing Homes Using Entertainment as Therapy at the beginning of this semester, requested funding in February for the club’s annual black tie concert fundraiser. Under the UC’s rules regarding fundraisers, he was turned down during his grant interview.
“I was not aware of that rule ahead of time. That was the first UC grant that I did,” Lee said. “It’s a good learning experience.”
“It’s not going to hurt us if we don’t get anything, but it’s always nice if we can get a little bit of help,” Lee added.
Additional rules, such as the rule against funding projects during reading period—an Office of Student Life stipulation—have also taken some students by surprise. During the same general meeting during which Concilio Latino was denied funding, three other organizations also did not receive funding for events that were to take place during reading period, according to the meeting agenda.
A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM
Based on the data provided on the UC’s website, the 2014-2015 academic year saw the least amount of UC funds requested on record. In the 2014-2015 school year, student organizations requested approximately $471,000 in funding, compared to $654,000 the previous year, and $546,000 the year before that.
In addition to a decrease in the amount of funding requested, the Finance Committee has also witnessed a decreasing number of grant requests from student organizations over recent years.
Last semester, student organizations submitted 347 total requests for UC funding, the lowest amount of any semester on record. In fall 2014, 386 requests were submitted, a decline from the 450 requests in fall 2013, 491 requests in fall 2012, and 504 requests in fall 2011. 
Greenlaw characterize the decline in grant requests during a UC general meeting in February as indicative of a “communication problem” on part of the Finance Committee.
In some cases, even when student organizations did request funding, members of the organization did not show up to their scheduled interview times.
In one instance, during the Feb. 17 Finance Committee meeting, seven grants requesting a cumulative total of more than $2,500 were denied any funding because representatives from their respective grant-requesting organizations did not attend interviews.
Even when students do show up to grant interviews, they often fail to show up to office hours with the UC Treasurer to receive their check or direct deposit. Of the 344 grant requests that were allocated funding last semester, 78 were never picked up by their requesting organizations, amounting to $28,824 in unutilized grants.
“If you can’t check your email for free money, I’ll give it to someone else,” Greenlaw said, when asked about absences during a UC general meeting. “We can’t give money to folks who don’t come get it.”
The Finance Committee has taken steps to improve communication between the committee and students. Earlier this month, the committee unanimously voted to pass a communication reform bill which seeks to keep club presidents and treasurers up to date on funding policy changes. It also ensures that student organizations that would be affected by funding policy changes are notified and consulted ahead of time.
The bill came in response to a controversial finance committee bill which placed a cap on funds to theater organizations. Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club President Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 said that her club was “disappointed with the lack of communication this semester,” in part due to the policy, and also because of a lack of clarity on what date theater organizations would be required to attend grant interviews.
Brophy said at a UC meeting earlier this semester that the Finance Committee had imposed a deadline for theater productions to apply for funding without notifying the HRDC board directly. While the Finance Committee later reached out to theater organizations to resolve the matter, Brophy said the situation reflected a “lack of transparency” and “miscommunication.”
The Finance Committee’s recent reforms to its communications policy appear to be working, Greenlaw said. In the five grant packs this year leading up to the passage of the communication reform, student organizations submitted an average of 38 grant requests per week.
Last week, during the first grant interview following the communication reform, the Finance Committee received 75 requests for regular grants from student organizations. Greenlaw attributes the increase in grant requests to the intensified communication and outreach to treasurers of student organizations.
In response to the large increase in grants last week, the Finance Committee issued its first grants pack cut of the year. While total allocations were projected to total $22,658, the committee cut the grant pack’s funding by 15 percent to bring the total below its $20,763 budget for the week.
A RULES-BASED ORGANIZATION
Although student groups request funding for a variety of venues and supplies, more than half of all funding requests last semester included food, which the Finance Committee strictly caps to a maximum of $4 per student for full meals. Small meals can be funded at $3 per person whereas the UC can subsidize snacks and desserts at $2 per person.
However, many student organizations routinely request more than the maximum per person allotment for food.
Last November, Human Rights in North Korea requested a $95 food grant for an event, but was only eligible to receive $30 because of the funding rules. In December, the Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia Association requested $1,000 but only received $135 for the same reason.
Members of the Finance Committee have on multiple occasions raised concerns about the current food funding policy, and suggested that an amendment to increase funding may be advisable.
“It seems like people get the short end of the stick when it comes to the food policy,” Bonsall said during a committee meeting. “I think that maybe needs to be updated.”
Others representatives are concerned about how the UC can ensure that organizations are being honest when they request and spend UC funds.
“I don’t know how good the auditing system is,” Rules Committee Chair Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, said during a Finance Committee meeting.
Nonetheless, without a change in funding rules, the committee is required to adhere to the existing policy.
“If we can’t work within the rules, there’s no point in having them,” Greenlaw said while discussing the committee’s policies. “I’m trying to be a rules-based organization.”
Still, Greenlaw has made communication a key priority of the Finance Committee, and expressed a willingness to assist groups that are hurt when the UC’s communication is inadequate.
“If we don’t give you proper information, then you’re eligible for redress of some sort,” Greenlaw said.
On Feb. 21, Levine published all of the Finance Committee’s records dating back to the fall 2011—including data on all grant requests and funding allocations—on the UC’s website. The website notes the UC’s commitment “to being accountable and transparent with students.”
“The accounting used to be a little bit dodgy over the past,” Greenlaw said during the UC’s first general meeting of the year. “There’ll be a lot of changes this semester… It’s going to be quite wicked.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives criticized recent recommendations on alcohol policies in Harvard's report on sexual assault prevention, though they praised the report’s call for annual sexual assault training for students.
Representatives responded to the University’s sexual assault prevention report, which a task force released earlier this month, in a general meeting on Sunday. The culmination of almost two years of research, the wide-ranging report makes a number of proposals for schools to implement mandatory annual training on sexual assault, bolster resources for BGLTQ students, and study the effects of alcohol policies on campus.
The report calls on College administrators to consider “policies to discourage consumption of hard liquor.”
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 raised doubts over the effectiveness of such measures.
“You make it so that younger students… can’t themselves get alcohol unless they go elsewhere to get alcohol. In going elsewhere, they’re going to the very spaces that [the task force] then spend[s] half the report disparaging,” Banks said, referring to final clubs. The task force’s report condemns male final clubs and calls on administrators to combat the “disturbing practical and cultural implications they present in undergraduate life.”
Former UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 argued that a policy restricting alcohol access would lead to more “social events that are unrecognized on campus, and that in turn encourages further bad behavior.”
Steinberg-Otter also argued that placing more security guards at entrances and exits to dorms, which the task force report recommends, would be ineffective.
Other representatives expressed concern over the pace at which the task force has worked, arguing that the issue of sexual assault deserves more immediate attention. The task force failed to meet its initial January 2016 deadline to release the report.
“I hope that the absolutely glacial pace at which this process is moving starts speeding up a little bit,” representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said.
Still, several representatives praised the report’s call for mandatory sexual assault prevention training for all students, and considered how the UC might assist in such an effort. Some pointed to the Finance Committee’s recently passed bystander intervention policy, which requires sexual assault training for some clubs requesting UC funding, as a valuable effort.
Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who authored the policy, said that 45 students from 20 student organizations have so far received sexual assault prevention training from OSAPR under the new policy.
However, Greenlaw also raised concerns over College-wide inconsistencies regarding sexual assault prevention training and argued that all Houses should have standardized training requirements.
“Perhaps it would be worthwhile for us to commit to lobbying our Houses to committing to doing this training,” Greenlaw said.
“When we’re talking about universal community problems of sexual assault policy [and] resources, we really want that to be standardized,” UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said.
Representatives also emphasized the importance of student input in determining the College’s response to the task force’s proposals.
“I want to see student input in designing the programs,” Freshman Class Committee Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said. “We really need to have a say in how we change campus culture.”
During the discussion, many representatives discussed the role of final clubs, which the task force report condemns, in the issue of sexual assault.
While some representatives argued that final clubs were disproportionately targeted in the report, others suggested that negotiating with final clubs may be advisable.
“I would strongly recommend that we should reopen that communication, especially if we want to negotiate with them,” Greenlaw said.
Rather said that she would be open to such communication. Rather and Banks will meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana later this week to discuss the UC’s perspective on the task force report.
Also during the UC’s meeting, the Council issued its first grants pack cut of the semester. After expected allocated funding to student organizations was projected to exceed its $20,763 budget this week, the Finance Committee issued a 15 percent cut on all regular grant funding for the week. The Council allocated an additional $8,820 under the body’s new Grant for an Open Harvard College.
The Council also passed legislation to fund large venue projects, Cabot Cafe, Freshman Health Week, and a raffle for Visitas hosts.

This article is the first in a series about sexual assault prevention at Harvard.
Earlier this month, Harvard released a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention, providing insight into a campus issue administrators have called “deeply disturbing” and detailing a number of recommendations for future prevention that University President Drew G. Faust immediately accepted.
The 20-page report covers all of Harvard’s schools, but disproportionately focuses on the College and holds few punches in critiquing current measures, while providing a number of undergraduate-specific suggestions that are exhaustive and far-reaching. 
House administrators praised some recommendations, including mandating sexual assault training for all students across Harvard. Other recommendations, like closing off certain entryways to Houses and dorms, “would not be feasible,” Adams Faculty Dean Sean Palfrey said.
Effective sexual assault prevention has been a top project for administrators in recent years. Although the report urges wide-scale change, many of the recommendations are already in progress, and now the College has formed two working groups to review the report and recommend a College-specific plan of action. They will submit their recommendations to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana by the end of the academic year.
PLANNING FOR PREVENTION
The two task forces have already begun meeting to implement the report’s recommendations at a College level, according to Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña and Freshman Resident Dean Madeleine A. Currie. But, the process of reviewing the report is only just beginning, and will require hours of parsing through the recommendations and assessing what resources Harvard has available to carry them out.
One working group is comprised of students and is co-advised by dela Peña and Emily J. Miller, the College’s Title IX coordinator. The second working group, comprised of staff and administrators, is co-chaired by dela Peña and Christopher M. Gilbert, assistant dean of Dudley House.
Though the College already made progress on some policies suggested in the report even before its release, several proposals would significantly alter current practices if implemented.
The report recommended the College institute mandatory yearly sexual assault awareness trainings, urging that the trainings encompass sexual health, conduct, and alcohol policy, in addition to the short briefing freshmen receive on Harvard’s specific policies.
The report also recommends revising the trainings for tutors and proctors—who serve as on-campus residential advisers—in order to “Enhance residential staff training to focus on building trust and providing knowledgeable guidance to direct students to University resources.” More specifically, the task force recommends all resident advisers living in Harvard’s dormitories receive sexual assault prevention training and response education.
Currie said the College prioritizes improving trainings for freshmen proctors. This year, the Freshman Dean’s Office mandated all proctors receive annual sexual assault trainings, and the FDO plans to review these trainings. Currie added she would like to cover more topics pertinent to the BGLTQ community in these trainings and consult freshmen students throughout the process.
This semester, groups within the College began experimenting with new trainings to better educate students on issues of sexual assault. Adams House, for example, piloted a series of sexual assault trainings led by the Consent Advocate and Relationship Educators, undergraduates who serve as liaisons between the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and undergraduates.
“I think that as we start to assess some of the pilot programs we’ve had here… we’re going to start to refine how we put these things together, market them, invite students to attend, and how we get buy-in from the community,” dela Peña said.
The trainings for freshmen and proctors only make up part of the FDO’s planned efforts to implement the report’s recommendations. For the past year, the FDO has funded and organized a number of social events for freshmen to promote social life on campus, many in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub.
“This year, thanks to the support of the Dean of the College and the Dean for Administration and Finance, we’ve offered more programming for freshmen that doesn’t involve alcohol,” interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. Dingman added one of the FDO’s goals was to further increase social programming for freshmen.
The report’s authors also continually urged the same solution for many problems surrounding sexual assault that they identified: focusing social life into the Houses under stricter administrative control. They emphasize the roles that aspects of the undergraduate party scene—such as the College’s alcohol policy, party registration processes, and single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations—can play in mitigating or increasing the possibility of sexual assault. In particular, the report strongly denounced the “distinctive problems” that the College’s unrecognized and historically male final clubs present regarding sexual assault, such as creating spaces of gender discrimination.
But these criticisms and suggestions about focusing on House life are not novel.
One of the report’s recommendations, for example, calls on administrators to support a “shared campus culture” by rallying behind large, student-run social events. During the fall semester, months before the report’s release, Faust took the unusual step of allocating funds to Khurana’s office in order to promote inclusive campus-wide parties. Khurana then directed a portion of Faust’s lump sum to fund the “[BLANK] Party,” a free College-wide party hosted by women’s groups at the College last October.
More generally, talk of increasing “inclusivity” in Harvard’s social life has dominated administrators’ discourse in recent years.
“There have been a number of campus-wide events that have been very successful,” Associate Dean of Student Life David Friedrich said. “We’re continuing to do a lot of work there.”
Another suggested change calls for a re-calibration of undergraduate social life, placing emphasis on House-wide events instead of those hosted by unrecognized social organizations, which have come under fire in recent years for their perceived exclusivity. This task, too,  is far from foreign to administrators.
Since 2013, the College has pumped millions of dollars towards House renewal, attempting to make the Houses a more attractive alternative to fraternity, sorority, and final club property.
Just this past year, some Houses like Adams have allocated rooms for students to hold private social events. Others have implemented streamlined party registration processes making it easier for students to throw dorm room gatherings. Both party spaces and registration processes were mentioned in the report as areas for improvement.
“We’re continuing to do a lot of work that has already begun, things like increasing funding for [events in] the Houses,” Friedrich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After playing their first two sevens tournaments of the spring season, the Harvard women’s rugby team has made two things abundantly clear: the team’s underclassmen are strong, and the Crimson’s defense does not give up many points.
At its second tournament of the spring, Harvard took second at the eight team Crimson 7’s tournament. Other teams at the tournament included Navy A, Navy B, Endicott, Quinnipiac, Sacred Heart, UNH, and West Chester. The tournament, played in Cambridge, was the second annual Crimson 7’s tournament. Last year, the Crimson split squads and took home second and seventh place.
“I thought we played really well,” sophomore Dalton Youngblood said.”It was exciting because you can definitely see the improvement that we’ve had from last year to this year and how much better we communicate. We’re a lot faster, we’re just a lot more natural about it.”
QUINNIPIAC 48, HARVARD 0
After allowing only four tries through four matchups, Harvard finally met some opposition against Quinnipiac in the championship game. Through four games in the tournament, the Bobcats also only allowed four tries before playing the Crimson in the final.
Quinnipiac, the National Collegiate Varsity Women’s Rugby Association (NCVWRA) 15’s Champions of the fall, appeared to be just as strong in 7’s play, ending the half up 26-0 en route to the Crimson 7s title with a 48-0 win over Harvard.
HARVARD 33, WEST CHESTER 10
For the first time in this tournament, Harvard’s opening try was answered with one from West Chester in the Semifinal game. After Harvard jumped to a 5-0 lead early in the first half, the Golden Rams answered with a try of their own to tie the game.
Despite the early try from West Chester, the Crimson scored back-to-back tries to go into half up 19-5. Youngblood and junior Claire Collins each added a second half try to go up 33-5 before West Chester scored in the final minutes. Youngblood ended the day with a team-high five tries.HARVARD 22, UNH 5
Underclassman play was a significant factor in Harvard’s final pool play game against New Hampshire as well. Youngblood opened scoring in the match with a pair of tries late in the first half to put the Crimson up 12-0. She was joined in the in-goal area by Chao and sophomore Haley Langan.
“Because...we’re a new varsity sport, we’re able to have recruits,” Youngblood said. “I think by having that opportunity to look at people and have them come in freshman year as...someone who’s already been playing in high school, I think that definitely helps improve our skill level overall.”
The defense held strong yet again, not letting up a try until the closing minutes. The Crimson jumped out to a 22-0 lead before giving up a try to the Wildcats. Out of the six halves played by the Crimson in their pool, four ended with Harvard shutting out their opponent.
HARVARD 35, NAVY A 5
Youngblood proved to be a dominant sevens player at the Frostbite 7’s tournament a few weeks ago, and she continued her impressive play this weekend. She opened the second half with back-to-back tries, putting the team’s lead at 29-0 before Navy finally scored. Alongside Youngblood were freshmen Caitlin Weigel and Grace Chao who accounted for the Crimson’s three other tries.
“We have a very talented group of underclassmen,” sophomore co-captain Isabel Delaura said, “but they also work tremendously hard. Everyone works tremendously hard on the team. We really have an environment in which the upperclassmen and the underclassmen are constantly pushing each other.”
Harvard’s defense was strong in their second game as well, letting up their first try of the tournament in the second half of the matchup
HARVARD 30, ENDICOTT 0
At the Frostbite 7’s tournament earlier this month, Harvard proved to be a defensive force, shutting out four of their six opponents on the day. This defense was was on display in the first game of the day against Endicott as the Crimson blanked the Gulls 30-0. On the day, Harvard only let up a total of four tries before being blown out by fall champions Quinnipiac in the final.
“We spent this week working on defense,” l Delaura said. “We did a lot of tackling drills and work on building our wall…. I think our defense framework is something we’ve been focusing on a lot, and it really showed in this tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her eighteen years of coaching, Harvard coach Lisa Miller has seen games won and lost in almost every imaginable way. She has been on both ends of blowouts, led comebacks and suffered collapses, and guided teams through everything in between. What happened on Saturday, as her Crimson women’s lacrosse squad (5-3, 1-1 Ivy) faced No. 10/11 Princeton (5-2, 2-0), still came as a surprise.
After spending most of the final ten minutes of the game on attack, looking to erase a 6-5 deficit and send the game into overtime, the Crimson had one last chance to draw even with just under a minute remaining. In a stellar solo sequence, sophomore Julia Glynn brought the ball around from behind the goal, faked a run to the middle of the field, spun, and fired. The shot found the back of the net, and Glynn ran towards the Harvard bench to celebrate with her teammates.
When the referees went to check if her stick satisfied regulations, however, they found that it was a few centimeters too long. With that, they discounted the goal.
The Crimson scrambled to cause a turnover and earned one more offensive possession before the end of the game, but did not get another shot past Tigers goalie Ellie DeGarmo. She finished with 14 saves, her new season-high.
By holding on at the end, Princeton snapped a two game losing streak and also secured its 15th consecutive regular season conference win. Harvard, meanwhile, suffered its first league loss after defeating Columbia in its Ivy opener.
The result marks the Tigers’ fifth straight win in the series, although the Crimson can gain confidence from keeping the game close after losing by a combined 21 goals in the two teams’ previous three contests.
“We played well enough to win,” Miller said. “We stuck to the gameplan, we stayed composed, and in general, we did a lot of really good things. The call at the end of the game was unfortunate, but we need to get better at finishing so we don’t put ourselves in situations like that.”
Failure to capitalize on goalscoring opportunities was a problem that plagued Harvard all day, as the Crimson managed almost twice as many shots as its opponents did but only had five points to show for it. The team was especially sharp offensively in the second half, outshooting Princeton, 14-4. The final shot count was 28-15 in favor of Harvard.
The chances were there for multiple Crimson players, as six tallied at least three shots. Junior attacker Marisa Romeo led the team with six, but only converted one of them. Likewise, none of her teammates scored more than one goal.
“We expect that all of our kids can score,” Miller said. “Unfortunately, it’s kind of like basketball, where some days, the shots just don’t fall, but I thought we got the looks we wanted today.”
Using a tactic of sitting back patiently but denying Princeton the opportunity to bring the ball close to the net, the Crimson was content with giving up long possessions but kept its opponents off the board.
The strategy helped keep the Tigers from going on a run, as they did not score more than two goals in a row at any point in the game before Harvard answered.
“A lot of the older girls we have on defense now know how to withstand pressure,” Crimson goalie and co-captain Kelly Weis said. “In the second half, draw controls were also very important. They allowed us to play the game at our own pace.”
With the combination of a stout defense and just enough offense, Harvard hung with Princeton for the first time in a few years, and the game would have likely gone to overtime were it not for the disallowed goal.
“It’s always hard to lose a game like that, but we’ll just have to take it in stride,” Weis said. “With [Princeton] being such a highly ranked team, now we know we can play with anyone in the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday, both the heavyweight and lightweight divisions of the Harvard-Radcliffe women’s rowing team set the bar high as they dominated the competition in their respective inaugural regattas of the spring season.
Out in the Charles River basin, the Radcliffe Heavyweight Varsity team competed with Northeastern, Boston College, Boston University and MIT in the ninth running of the Beanpot regatta. The squad captured the coveted Beanpot trophy, nearly sweeping the entire event in every race with the exception of the 4th Varsity 8, which fell to BC.
Similarly, down on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, NJ, the Radcliffe Varsity Lightweight team collected its share of hardware for Weld Boathouse.  The squad managed to vanquish the Princeton boats in every race, taking home the Class of 1999 Cup.
Having laid down a solid groundwork to build upon for upcoming races, the two squads look to keep honing their skills to ensure that their successes continue in the future.
“Mostly we want to think not just about this weekend, but the season as a whole,” said junior Radcliffe Heavyweight rower and Under-23 sculler, Mary Carmack.  “We still are looking to improve and get faster with every race.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
For the first time since 2012 the Radcliffe Heavyweights opened their season with the Beanpot. The squad has emerged victorious in seven of the eight iterations of the event only losing only once to Columbia and BC in 2010.  Nevertheless, the Black and White viewed this year as particularly successful as all of its victories were won by open water—with the Varsity 8 boat winning the premier event by a 3.9 second margin over Northeastern.
“We got off the line and we were pretty much ahead right off the start, kept taking seats and gradually pushed away from the other boats,” junior Isabella Benduski said.  “Our whole team was pleased with the results but we know we have some work to do to keep getting faster.”
While it still seeks to work on potential areas of improvement, the RVH team has already made a sizeable down payment thanks to valuable water time spent in Florida this spring break.
“Florida was a huge part in how we got faster this year,” Benduski said.  “While there we practiced twice a day, racing everyday against each other and we really worked on matching up our strokes and swinging together.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweights also had a stellar performance against Princeton. With wins in every category, the RVL squad displayed its proficiency and depth this year.
“Today was a great start to the season for RVL,” senior oarswoman Gabby McNeil said. “It was a great day of racing across the board for the 1V, 2V and 3V.  We also brought a lot of novices, who had never raced before, so this definitely was a great start to the season for everyone on the team.”
Aside from the sweep, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this year’s performance at the Class of 1999 Cup was the Varsity 8’s vast increase in margin of victory over the Tigers relative to last year.  Whereas in last year’s race, the V8 edged Princeton out by a mere half a second, this year, the Radcliffe boat crossed the finish line 17 seconds before its Princeton counterpart.
Again, much of this success can be attributed to the team’s ability to train on the water much sooner this year.  Thanks to the river thawing early and the training trip to Florida this spring, the squad has managed to gain traction right away this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing its blazing outdoor season, the Harvard women’s track and field team set three new Ivy and five school records this weekend at the Raleigh Relays.
One week after recording a personal best in the 100 meter dash, freshman Gabby Thomas one-upped that with a winning time of 23.18 seconds in the 200-meter dash. Besides being a career-best and Ivy record, Thomas’s run was also good enough to automatically qualify for the 2016 Olympic Trials, which she is slated to run in this upcoming July.
The time is nearly a full second faster than the previous 200-meter Harvard record, set last year by Danielle Barbian ’15 and is also the NCAA’s third-fastest time this year.
“We’re thrilled with how Gabby is doing,” co-captain Paige Kouba said. “[The coaches] knew she was good in high school, but she hadn’t yet shown the world what she could do yet. We had a really great senior class graduate last year, and all the [freshmen] girls who came in this year have really filled that gap.”
Thomas also played a role in two other Ivy record-setting performances this weekend—the 4x100 meter and 4x200 meter relays. Both relays were run by the same lineup of Thomas, fellow freshman Ngozi Musa, junior Jade Miller, and senior Autumne Franklin.
The four-girl squad won the 4x100 meter relay in 44.56 seconds, three-tenths of a second better than their own old Ivy record of 44.85 seconds, which they set only last weekend. They also finished the 4x200 meter relay in 1:34.45 seconds, which was over a second faster than the old Ivy mark and five seconds faster than the previous Harvard record.
“That group [of four girls] is an amazing thing to watch,” Kouba said. “They’re showing that we’re not just good in the Ivy League—we have a national presence here, and we’re making that known.”
Kouba also had quite a meet of her own, cutting more than seven seconds off her personal record in her 1500-meter race. Her run was best among all the participating college students and was second overall, behind only professional PUMA athlete Caroline King.
Kouba’s time of 4:16.46 is also a new school record and second in the NCAA this year.
“I’m very happy to have a race like that that shows what I’m made of,” Kouba said. “The last year of my life has been about really dedicating time and effort and emotion to this sport, and it’s very fulfilling to have that come to fruition.
Elsewhere at the event, junior Jade Miller scored sixth in the 200 meter dash with a personal record of 24.23. Senior Kieran Gallagher scored two outdoor personal bests in the 1500 meter and 800 meter runs, earning 19th and seventh place finishes, respectively.
“This was a really good weekend for us, especially at this early point in the season,” Kouba said. “It’s very exciting to take a small group to a meet like this and just clean up.”
On the men’s side, sophomore Gabe Montague took home 11th in the 1500 meter run with a career-best time of 3:50.91, and senior Tom Purnell scored 25th place in the same race, with a time of 3:53.38.
“The guys who traveled did well and had some good performances,” sophomore Ben Huffman said. “It’s early in the season, though, so we’re not exactly where we want to be in terms of times.”
Huffman, on his way to a 38th-place finish, set a new personal best in the 5,000 meter run with a time of 14:25.53. Meanwhile, senior Chris Allen scored 42nd place in the 10,000 meter run with a time of 30:38.99.
“My personal experience was pretty standard for the rest of the team—solid performance, but definitely a lot of work to do,” Huffman said. “Looking forward, there’s a lot of potential for growth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
n an exciting Easter Sunday showing for the No.50 Harvard men’s tennis team (12-8), the Crimson upset No.38 Old Dominion (14-4), 4-3, and defeated No.7 Amherst (9-3, 1-0 NESCAC), 5-2.
The two home wins reflect the team’s recent upward trajectory as it recovers from a few losses in San Diego over spring break and prepares for the start of Ivy League play next weekend.
“We’ve had a tough stretch the past two weeks,” co-captain Conor Haughey said. “We’ve played a lot of good teams and haven’t had the results we’ve been looking for, so it was good to see it all come together today and get some confidence.”
HARVARD 5, AMHERST 2
Harvard took a decisive lead with three consecutive wins on the doubles side. The duo of junior Brian Yeung and sophomore Jean Thirouin claimed a 6-4 victory at first doubles. Haughey and Kelvin Lam won 6-2 at second doubles, while freshman Michael Peters and co-Captain Nicky Hu came out on top at third doubles as well.
“Obviously having a double header when the second match is at 5pm on Easter Sunday isn’t the easiest time to get fired up and dig down and fight hard, but we all worked together and really made it happen,” Haughey said.
Playing first singles, freshman Andy Zhou claimed a 6-2, 6-2 victory over his Purple & White opponent. Thirouin overcame a close first set to handily take the second set in a 7-5, 6-1 win at second singles. Amherst earned a point at third singles in a tight third-set tiebreaker, but the Crimson countered with a similar third-set win from Haughey.
Harvard and the Purple & White split fifth and sixth singles, with freshman Sam Beren taking a 6-3, 6-4 victory at fifth while Peters suffered a loss at sixth. But the Crimson’s total was enough to secure its second victory for the day.
The double-header against a top-tier school gave the team an opportunity to give freshmen and other players valuable playing time.
HARVARD 4, OLD DOMINION 3
After starting the season at No.32 and dropping to No.50 over the past few months, Harvard’s win over No.38 Old Dominion was an upset that snapped the Monarchs’ 12-match win streak.
“I think the good results came from the team carrying on from where we left off on the last day in San Diego where we trusted and committed to our game-styles more, and that really paid off in the crucial points today,” freshman Christopher Morrow said.
The Monarchs pulled ahead early by winning the opening doubles point and Harvard suffered two 6-3 losses at second and third doubles, leaving the third match at first doubles unfinished.
“We’ve been struggling all year to figure out the doubles point,” Haughey said. “But I think we do have a lot of confidence in the guys’ singles ability to go out and play with their backs against the wall…. The guys really stepped it up today after losing the doubles point.”
The Crimson clinched the four of six wins in the singles competition that it needed. The situation seemed precarious for Harvard when Hu fell to Old Dominion sophomore Adam Moudir in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2, extending the Monarchs’ lead to 2-0.
But the Crimson came back with its own straight-set win from senior Kelvin Lam at fifth singles in a quick 6-1, 6-3 victory. At fourth singles, Zhou similarly took down his opponent 6-0, 6-3.
“Old Dominion is a really good team so everyone had to play their best to win, and a couple of strong performances from our fourth, fifth, and sixth pulled out the win for us,” sophomore Kenny Tao said.
Old Dominion took one more win at third singles over Yeung, but Harvard edged the Monarchs out with two close victories at second and sixth singles. Senior Sebastian Beltrame snagged a tiebreaker win in his second set over Old Dominion freshman Aziz Kijametovic at second singles. Morrow recovered from dropping his second set and fended off his opponent in the third set to solidify Harvard’s win.
“[Morrow] has been playing really well the past few weeks for us, so it’s pretty great for all that work and effort to come to fruition and for him to pick up the clinching win for us,” Haughey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Behind a slew of impressive performances from the starting rotation, the Harvard baseball team (7-9) split a pair of doubleheaders this weekend on the road at Fairfield (6-13) and then at home against Albany (8-12).
The team’s four starters combined to allow just four runs over 25.1 innings (1.42 ERA). The bullpen, however, allowed ten runs in 6.2 innings, struggling to find consistency.
Offensively, the team’s hottest hitters continued to produce. Freshman first baseman Pat McColl extended his hit streak to an impressive nine games over the weekend while sophomore third baseman John Fallon’s eight-game streak came to an end on Sunday afternoon after two more multi-hit performances against the Stags.
“[Batter’s box presence] has been the theme with those two this year,” captain DJ Link said. “They’re both young, but when you watch them play, you know they’ve been there before. They’re staying simple, they’re doing their thing, they’re doing their jobs.
HARVARD 3, ALBANY 2
The Crimson finished off the weekend in winning fashion, riding the arm of tall freshman right-hander Kevin Stone to a 3-2 victory on a chilly Sunday afternoon.
Stone had a shaky start, loading the bases in the second before allowing three straight hits and two runs in the fourth, but the Connecticut native regained his composure to post an impressive stat line of two runs over seven innings.
Harvard’s offense did just enough to get the job done, with freshman left fielder Trent Bryan hitting an RBI single to right before Fallon’s sacrifice fly doubled its advantage. After the Great Danes knotted the score at two, the Crimson responded in the bottom of the fifth to retake the lead, one they would never relinquish.
Sophomore left-hander Dylan Combs entered in relief of Stone, recording a two-inning save with two strikeouts and just one hit allowed.
“Kevin got stronger as the game went on,” coach Bill Decker said. “His pitch count was where it needed to be. And to see [Dylan] Combs do what he did, it was great; we need our younger guys to produce.”
ALBANY 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson dropped the opener against the Great Danes, 3-0, in a game that featured just seven hits between the two teams at O’Donnell Field. Starter Ian Miller recorded five innings of no-hit ball before he and senior Nick Scahill combined to allow three runs in the top of the sixth.
Junior catcher Josh Ellis recorded a single and two walks, reaching safely in all three of his plate appearances. He was a bright spot in an otherwise dismal offensive outing from Harvard, as Albany starter Stephen Woods threw a complete game, seven scoreless, with eight strikeouts. The Crimson also stranded seven runners in scoring position.
“[Driving in runners] is a big part of the game, that you always need to work,” Link said. “Coach has been preaching that to us, you know, hitting with runners in scoring position.”
Miller looked strong in his best outing of the year, allowing just 1 run in 5.1 innings. He was replaced by Scahill in the sixth, but the Coral Springs, Fla. native allowed two doubles and a two-out single to give up the three runs. The offense could muster no response and was ultimately shut out for the first time this season.
FAIRFIELD 8, HARVARD 6
The Crimson fell in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, with three Harvard relievers combining to surrender eight runs in the eighth inning. Senior righty Sean Poppen allowed just one hit in six scoreless innings, exiting the game with a seemingly safe 6-0 lead, but the bullpen was unable to keep the Stags offense under wraps.
“We had a chance to extend the lead in the sixth and seventh, get it done, but we left too many runners in scoring position,” Decker said. “Then it kind of blew up on us. One base hit and then all of a sudden it was like a football game: they got a touchdown and a two-point conversion before we could do anything.”
Bryan opened the scoring with a RBI double in the top of the fourth before a McColl sacrifice fly and two wild pitches plated three more an inning later. The Crimson extended the lead to six in the seventh with an error and Ellis’ RBI single.
After recording a 1-2-3 inning in the bottom of the seventh, captain Matt Sanders allowed two singles and two walks to start the eighth before being replaced by senior righty TJ Laurisch. Laurisch allowed three singles himself, failing to record an out, before senior lefty Sean O’Neill came in with the game at 6-5. He eventually got three outs, but three more runs crossed the plate.
HARVARD 7, FAIRFIELD 1
Behind junior right-hander Nick Gruener’s second complete game in as many outings, the Crimson snatched the first contest of the weekend, 7-1, against the Stags. Gruener improved to 3-1 on the season with seven innings of one-run ball, striking out five and walking just one to take his K-BB ratio to 21-2 on the season.
“Nick pitched really well,” Decker said. “He’s been really consistent for us, and you’re going to play well behind them because he has good tempo, good rhythm.”
Harvard jumped on their opponents early, scoring five times in the second inning to open up a comfortable advantage. Junior shortstop Drew Reid started the scoring with a RBI single before senior Mitch Klug and Fallon notched a two-run single and double respectively.
All nine Crimson starters reached base during the game, while Klug and Fallon each recorded multi-hit games. Fairfield got one run back in the bottom of the fourth, but sophomore right fielder Connor Quinn’s two-run single in the next frame was more than enough for Gruener, who allowed just six hits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well rested and well positioned, the Harvard men’s volleyball team entered the William H. Pitt Center with high hopes.
The Crimson (9-8, 5-3 EIVA) hadn’t played a match since a March 14 loss to California Baptist and hadn’t faced a conference foe since playing Sacred Heart nine days before that.
On Saturday night, still owning a claim to second place in the EIVA, Harvard suited up to face the Pioneers (6-12, 4-4) once more. Last time had been a relaxed three-set victory that kicked off the month of March.
But as they say: in like a lion, out like a lamb. In a 3-0 defeat, the Crimson resembled a timid version of its former self, hitting to .187 on a night when the closest set was 25-17.
“We were especially flat,” captain Branden Clemens said. “I think we’re a good team, but I don’t think we’re a talented enough team that we can cruise through teams.”
Meanwhile Sacred Heart played at historic levels of efficiency. The Pioneers finished with a .412 kill rate, the fourth-highest mark in program history, and opened play by hitting a scorching .484 in the first game.
For all the mishits and missteps that Harvard made, it was simply Sacred Heart’s night.
“That’s definitely the best I’ve seen them play,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “It seemed like they couldn’t make a mistake…. Their offense was clicking on all cylinders, and our defense really wasn’t doing much to slow them down.”
The Crimson led once all match: after the first point of the third set. But any flicker of optimism blew out abruptly, as the Pioneers took four of the next five points.
While a mid-set 3-0 run steadied Harvard and pushed the count to a competitive 9-8, Sacred Heart responded with a 3-0 run of its own. The Crimson never came closer in a 25-17 set defeat.
During the frame, Harvard compiled a dismal .107 kill percentage, the lowest rate of the night. Overall the highest efficiency mark that any player tallied was .333—and that number belonged to the setter, sophomore Marko Kostich.
The Pioneers shot to an immediate lead, winning the first three points of the contest. The score spiraled from there, and by the time Sacred Heart held a 7-2 advantage, Crimson coach Brian Baise was compelled to use an early timeout.
The stoppage of play only paused the damage, as the Pioneers continued the demolition when they returned to the floor. The set ended—mercifully—at 25-17.
Sacred Heart tallied 18 kills in the game, topped by a remarkable 11 by senior outside hitter Austin Arcala. On the night, Arcala led his side with 22 finishes, while junior outside hitter Michael Comens contributed 10. By contrast no Harvard player reached double-digit kills.
Some of the offensive inefficiency could have been attributed to a reconfigured lineup. After two weeks of inaction, junior outside hitter Casey White returned to his typical spot on the floor—but with only one day of practice under his belt.
Rustiness was one of several problems in the second frame, in which Sacred Heart copied the template of the first: win the opening three points and pile on from there. Midway through the set, the Pioneers put together their most dominant streak of the evening, taking eight of nine straight points.
The lead proved invincible, as Sacred Heart claimed the set by a margin of 10 points—the largest gap at any time during play.
“We were out of system a lot,” Clemens said. “They were able to put a lot of pressure on us offensively…. Hopefully it was just a post-spring-break kind of lull.”
While the margin of victory may have come as a surprise, the Pioneers’ competence was less shocking. This year’s EIVA boasts dense competition. There are two outliers—Penn State, which has only lost one conference match, and Charleston, which has yet to win one—but all other teams sport between three and six wins.
The result is a muddled middle, and Harvard is at dead center, now in a two-way tie for third place.
“All the teams are certainly capable of being in that top four to make it to the conference playoffs,” Schlossman said. “Now it’s going to be a little tougher. Our spot isn’t as secure as it was.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a spring break trip to Georgia and South Carolina, the Harvard men’s golf team headed back south this weekend, participating in the Furman Intercollegiate in Greenville, S.C. After 72 holes of play over two days, the Crimson came away with a second-place finish.
“It was really important this weekend to see the improvements we had been working on from last week start to settle in,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “The result that we did was really nice confirmation that we are working on the correct things. I am very proud of the guys this week.”
Harvard completed the three rounds at a minus-8 856, 15 strokes behind Georgia State (841) for the title. The course played at a par 72. The Crimson sat in first place after round one on Friday with a score of 284 (-4), and continued to play well on Saturday, turning in a competitive score of 280 (-8).
Georgia State turned in an impressive 13-under 275 on Saturday, inching the Panthers ahead of the Crimson on the leaderboard. This competitive round two was led by Maximilian Herrmann and Sam Asbury of Georgia State, receiving three under-par performances on the first three holes.
Captain Rohan Ramnath and junior Robert Deng steadily led the way for Harvard and finished in second and fifth place, respectively, at the conclusion to the first two rounds. Ramnath shot a seven-under 209, while Deng’s 210 put him six strokes below par. Firing round scores of 69 and 66 put Ramnath at minus-9, finishing only one stroke behind Ryan Cornfield of USC Upstate (134) at the end of the day on Saturday.
“I drove the ball really well and that simplified the game. In general and on this course especially, some of the tee shots are really tight and I hit the driver really well,” Ramnath said. I played smart off the tee even when I did miss, contributing to the good score on Saturday,”
Following a round three score of plus-2, Ramnath ended the tournament with a fourth place finish.
Deng also posted scores of 70, 68, and 72, supporting Harvard’s effort by coming in at eighth place on the player leaderboard.
Sophomore Greg Royston (E, 216) and freshman Seiya Liu (+3,147) also played well, placing 21st and 64th, respectively, out of a field of 115 individual players and 19 schools.
After a strong early showing that placed him in 18th at the conclusion of the first round, Royston dropped position slightly in the second round with a stroke score of 73. This one-over-par round caused him to fall incrementally to 27th in the field. A strong finish in the third round on Sunday propelled Royston back up to the 21st slot overall.
Liu also remained steady throughout the tournament with scores of 74, 73, and 76. Junior Daniel De La Garza rounded out the Crimson squad, finishing 71st at a plus-8.
The Crimson concluded the tournament in second, maintaining its position in the team rankings after a 292 (+4) third round on Sunday.
“The unifying commonality was our approach to what we were doing,” Rhoads said. “This weekend we really looked to be organized in every shot, to know exactly what each player was expecting to do and trusting in their ability to do it.”
Harvard returns to the green after a one-week hiatus at the Princeton Invitational, a 54-hole tournament at Springdale Golf Club in Princeton, N.J in two weekends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wrapping up its first month of spring competition, the Harvard sailing team competed in three regattas over the weekend–two local races, the NEISA/MAISA Team Race at Boston College and the BU Team Race Invitational, as well as the Friis Trophy Team Race in Connecticut.
In different locations, Crimson boats faced different challenges, but the team finished in the top six at all three regattas.
FRIIS TROPHY TEAM RACE
It was a veteran affair this weekend as Harvard sent three experienced pairs down to Coast Guard to sail in the competitive Jan T. Friis Trophy Team Race.
Three older skippers, senior Andrew Mollerus, senior Marek Zaleski and sophomore Nick Sertl, joined three older crews, senior Sydney Karnovsky, junior Julia Lord, and junior Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj, to race in Connecticut.
The old hands proved steady, as the Crimson placed in sixth, or the middle of the pack, with an overall record of 5-6. Harvard competed against nine other teams, namely Fordham, Dartmouth, Coast Guard, Brown, George Washington, MIT, and Roger Williams.
“We sailed fast and beat some good teams but we were hampered by a couple close losses to average teams,” Sertl said.
The weather conditions were close to ideal with light wind throughout Saturday. Only the first 10 races were sailed in a dying northerly, while the rest of the competition enjoyed a perfect southerly.
The prevalence of veterans was unusual for a team that boasts more freshmen than any other class level.
“It’s really cool to be on a young team,” freshman skipper Taylor Gavula said. “I feel lucky to have this experience, and we’re going to try really hard to qualify for nationals.”
NEISA/MAISA TEAM RACE
The Boston College Team Race is normally a two-day race, stretched over Saturday and Sunday. But this past weekend, ideal weather conditions enabled the regatta to finish in one day.
“Usually we get there on Saturday around nine or ten and sail until four or five,” sophomore skipper Taylor Ladd said. “[This Saturday] we just stayed a little longer and sailed until six.”
That was exactly as much time as Harvard needed to overcome a rough morning and rebound in the afternoon to finish in fourth place.
Throughout the event, the Crimson--which raced in FJ vessels--fielded a young group of sailors.
Sophomores Ladd, Dylan Farrell (skipper), and Kevin Coakley (crew) partnered with freshmen Nick DiGiovanni (skipper), Christine Gosioco (crew), and Lena Episalla (crew) to race at the Savin Hill Yacht Club and in Dorchester Bay.
Due to the cooperative weather, event organizers fit all 45 races into Saturday despite the race being scheduled for Sunday as well.
“There was a really good breeze the whole day,” Ladd said.
Still, Harvard struggled in the morning, breaking for lunch with a 1-4 record. That mark put the team at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the field, which included Coast Guard, Boston College, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Roger Williams, and Yale.
However, Harvard greatly improved its standing in the afternoon and ultimately placed fourth with a record of 9-6. Yale came in first, followed by Hobart and William Smith Colleges and Boston College.
“After lunch we got our stuff together and went 8-1,” Ladd said. “Overall we learned a lot and got better as a team. You could see the progression throughout the day.”
BU TEAM RACE INVITATIONAL
After an onshore delay waiting for wind and a late report time, Harvard began racing at the BU Team Race Invitational shortly after 11:30.
The day hardly improved when the Crimson hit the water, as the team finished fifth with a record of 1-7. Harvard’s lone win came against Roger Williams University in the second round.
Overall the races at the BU Team Race Invitational were close. As a light easterly built over the course of the day, ranging from two to seven knots, Boston University battled Bowdoin College for control of first and second. The Terriers ultimately triumphed because they held tiebreakers.
Despite the disheartening results, Harvard’s focus for the weekend was on gaining experience and learning from the racing process.
A trio of freshmen skippers–Nicholas Karnovsky, Jackson Wagner and Andrew Puopolo–united with senior crew Adam Brodheim and freshman crew members Divya Arya and Catherine Tang to race against six teams in FJ dinghies.
“We’ve been working on everyone learning a lot and getting better for our team next year,” Ladd said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No.14/15 Harvard men’s lacrosse team entered its Saturday afternoon matchup with Dartmouth in a situation very similar to the one it was in when the two squads faced off a year ago. Coming off several underwhelming losses to highly ranked opponents, both the 2015 and 2016 teams knew that they had to take care of the Big Green, one of the weaker sides in the Ivy in recent years, to get back on track.
Last season, the Crimson came out flat in Hanover, N.H., falling in an early 3-1 hole before clawing back, only to lose the game in double overtime.
This year, however, the team knew it could not suffer another letdown, and played with a sense of urgency from the very first whistle. The result was Harvard’s first comprehensive victory this season, as it raced out to a 10-3 lead by halftime and closed out just as impressively to cruise to an 18-8 victory. Dartmouth did not manage to outscore the Crimson in any of the four quarters.
With the strong performance, Harvard (5-4, 1-1 Ivy) is back in the win column for the first time since March 5th, when it was 4-0 and riding high after dispatching then-No. 4/4 Duke. The Crimson had dropped four straight since then, but with the victory Saturday, the squad hopes to put that stretch behind it. The Big Green (1-6, 0-1 Ivy), meanwhile, will still be looking for its first conference victory when it hosts Cornell and Yale in the next two weeks.
For Harvard, success started with getting the midfield more involved on offense. After a midweek showing against BU in which only one goal came from a player not in the attacking unit, the seven Crimson midfielders accounted for a total of eight goals against Dartmouth.
Three of the seven scored their first goal of the season, including sophomores Beau Bayh and Spencer Evans and senior face-off specialist Keegan Michel. For Bayh and Evans, the goals were also their first collegiate tallies.
“It’s not often you have a chance to play the younger guys,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We were fortunate to jump out to a big lead today and give a lot of guys some game time.”
In fact, by the time four quarters had passed, the Crimson had played all four of its goalies, with each making at least one save. Sophomore Robert Shaw played most of the match to earn the win, making 10 saves on 14 shots in the process. Senior Bryan Moore, junior Colin Delea, and freshman Jack Corbett all contributed as well.
In front of them, senior defenseman Bobby Duvjnak set the tone for the defense once again with a strong showing. He entered the day tied for the fourth in the country with 2.25 caused turnovers per game, and added to the impressive number by creating four more takeaway opportunities against the Big Green. No other player on the team had more than one.
“We were really solid as a unit today and credit to my teammates for that,” Duvnjak said. “Early in the season, we were sliding a little too much and letting our opponents earn easy shots close to goal, but we did a better job of preventing those today.”
Harvard also showed improvement in faceoffs, an area of the game that has troubled the squad thus far in the season. While Dartmouth ended with a slight edge, winning 15 to the Crimson’s 14, Harvard won most of the faceoff battles earlier in the game when it was still hanging in the balance.
“Keegan fought and scrapped hard today,” Wojcik. “He really did a good job at the X and that was a big shot in the arm for our team.”
Usual stalwarts in attack, senior Devin Dwyer and sophomore Morgan Cheek, continued to play well and finished with a combined five goals and seven assists. For the Big Green, junior attackman Wiley Osborne paced the offense with two goals, three assists, and a game-high eight shots.
“We did a good job all around today, and it was first time in a while we put everything together in one game,” Duvnjak said. “We needed this one, especially in the Ivy, and now it’s on to the next one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team often names securing a place as one of the best programs in the country as its biggest goal. This weekend, the Crimson got a chance to make that dream a reality as it sent a handful of athletes to the NCAA Championships at the McAuley Aquatic Center in Atlanta, Ga. to face the nation’s fastest swimmers.
Sophomore Shane McNamara and the relay team of freshman Sebastian Lutz, sophomore Steven Tan, and juniors Max Yakubovich and Paul O’Hara made the trip south to race for Harvard on the national stage. In addition to swimmers from the country’s top-ranked programs, the Crimson also faced opponents from Ancient Eight rivals Penn, Princeton, Cornell, and Yale.
McNamara competed in the 100 breaststroke, having qualified with a second-place finish at the Ivy League Championships in February. The sophomore’s time of 53.43 in the preliminaries was almost two tenths of a second faster than his qualifying mark, but it was not quick enough to advance him to the finals.
The Crimson also raced in the 200 freestyle relay and the 200 medley relay, entering the national championships as the Ancient Eight titleholders in both events.
After qualifying with an NCAA ‘A cut’ time of 1:17.55 in the 200 free relay at the conference championship meet, Harvard put in a strong performance in Atlanta, ending up in 14th in the prelims to qualify for the B final.
In the consolation round, the Crimson faced the Princeton relay team that it had bested at Ivy Championships, but Harvard was unable to replicate its result from the previous month, touching the wall after the Tigers for eighth place in the final. The finish placed the Crimson in 16th overall and earned the group honorable mention All-America honors.
The team returned to the pool for the 200 medley relay but finished more than a second off of its qualifying time and was unable to advance to the final.
When the meet came to a close, Harvard was in 44th place, tied with Penn State, Arizona State, and Cornell. With all of the Crimson athletes who made the trip to Georgia returning for Harvard next season, the Crimson will get another shot at national championships glory next year.

About two weeks ago, the clocks magically jumped forward an hour, and we all lost an hour of our spring break. Unless you’re so sleep deprived that you’re always tired and didn’t realize you’d missed out on that sacred 60 minutes, you probably feel like you get ripped off annually when we “spring forward.” But here’s the good news: You now have one extra hour of daylight at the end of your day, meaning it's no longer pitch black out at 5 p.m. when your classes end. Here are some awesome things you can do with that hour:
Go for a run outsideAs it gets warmer, you’ll be able to run outside instead of having to do the frigidly awkward sprint to the MAC in your shorts. And now, thanks to Daylight Savings, you can be assured that there will be light outside during your run so you don’t have to worry as much about suspicious characters. Alternatively, if you’re like us, and the only time you ever run is when the doors to the dining hall are about to close, you can take the extra daylight to exercise by walking briskly with a pair of shake weights to JP Licks.
Update your lookAn extra hour of daylight = an extra hour of sunlight. Make sunglasses a staple to your wardrobe. Pro tip: Even if you’re not going to wear the sunglasses over your eyes, they can look nice on top of your head, and it’s much more acceptable to do that when the sun is actually shining so you don’t look like you just woke up with the world’s biggest hangover.
Get your cameras outThe sunlight as the sun sets can be the perfect #SelfieLighting. Take advantage of this while you can. If you’re friendless, consider this selfie stick disguised as a hand to make it look like you’re not a complete loser. If you do happen to have friends, gather them together and take pictures outside. After all, if you don’t have photographic evidence, your future kids may not believe you actually talked to people in college let alone had friends at any point in your life.
Rediscover what your acquaintances look likeFor many dark, cold months now, you’ve been looking at your friends in harsh indoor lighting. Either that or you haven’t really ever left your room and you just interact with your friends through emojis. Take this opportunity to reacquaint yourself with these people. Maybe even *gasp* venture to the Quad to see that freshman year buddy you excommunicated after the cold rushed in during the fall. Make sure you can still handle the sight of your blockmates’ faces in the light, especially as you navigate planning your living arrangements for next year. While these things may not have seemed important in the winter, spring is coming.
