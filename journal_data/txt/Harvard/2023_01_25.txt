Issac Brock, lead singer and guitarist of Modest Mouse, walked onto Roadrunner’s stage on Dec. 16 with a jean jacket and spiked hair, picked up his guitar, and began to perform a sloppy version of Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” When the crowd cheered, he laughed to himself and stopped playing. Then the set began in earnest.
On tour to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their 1997 album “The Lonesome Crowded West,” the highly influential indie-rock band reminded the audience that they were grungy back in the day, and they still are. They may look slightly older and have bigger bellies, but that reckless teen spirit is still there.
They played tracks from “The Lonesome Crowded West” in order. Brock spit out the words to the first song “Teeth Like God’s Shoeshine” — the lyrics were almost incomprehensible, but that didn't matter to the headbanging crowd. The performance was hard rock — energetic, loud, and crazy due to the guitars sounding like an alarm blaring. The band embraced the eccentricity of the song, acting as if they were teenagers once again.
The concert mixed nostalgia with a hefty dose of good humor. Simon O’Connor on the guitar wore long bangs in front of his face in a style oddly reminiscent of the 90s. Many newer fans who know them for their Indie Rock hits like “Float On,” a song they didn’t play at the show, were introduced to the grunge of Modest Mouse’s starting days.
The fifth song of the set and album, “Jesus Christ Was An Only Child,” featured acoustic guitars to highlight the folksy feel behind the lyrics. “Jesus Christ was an only child, he went down to the river and drank and smiled,” Brock and O’Connor sang together, Brock's face turning redder with exertion as the song got louder. “Yeah I know now what I knew then,” he screamed three times as the song came to a climax.
The opener also contributed to the light hearted atmosphere before Modest Mouse’s set. The performer, who goes by the name Mattress, performed gothic experimental EDM music. He wore a gold suit and jewel-encrusted dress shoes that must have touched every part of the stage as he danced around in an unusual stepping type of salsa.
He danced like a middle aged man might if no one was watching. The lyrics were so random they could have been made up on the spot. But that could also have been the point. Regardless, his performance was unforgettable.
In “Doin’ the Cockroach,” the drummer, Jeremiah Green, held the chaotic song together, switching between quick and complicated rhythms at lightning speed. At one point, Green even took out maracas that he shook with one hand while he kept playing the drum set with the other.
Green was essential too, even when the set slowed down during the last two songs, “Bankrupt on Selling” and “Styrofoam Boots/ It's All On Ice, Alright,” played mostly acoustically. The headbangs turned into sways, and people in the crowd took out their lighters. These two songs were the highlights of the set, as they stood out so drastically from the crazy energy of the first thirteen songs. The last song began with Brock on acoustic guitar playing a folk fingerpicking pattern, but Green joined back in on drums about halfway through, and Brock started screaming again. They couldn’t let it end on a soft note, not when they were focused on reminding everyone how grungy they are.
But it would be impossible to forget after this show. The song “Shit Luck,” started off with Brock screaming the first line of only four in the whole song. “This plane is definitely crashing,” he yelled. He leaned forward and slammed on the strings of the guitar at his shins. Then, as he stood up, he brought the guitar up to his face and played with his teeth, his mouth eating the strings.
At the end of the set, Mattress thanked Modest Mouse and told the audience to get ready for their performance. “They are going to make you cry,” he said. This statement proved to be true.
“The Lonesome Crowded West” deserved a tribute anniversary tour. The album transcends genre boundaries, not clearly falling into any category, but touching on blues, grunge, folk rock and many more, not to mention the level of comfort and enjoyment each of the members has on stage after so many years of performing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’ve probably heard it before. It’s commonly said that there are three topics one cannot broach in conversation: religion, politics, and money.
I have a confession: I am a repeat — if not serial — offender when it comes to one of them. While I do not blab, unsolicited, about a Swiss alps vacation, or talk my problem set buddy’s ear off about abortion, I do talk about religion. And not just with people who know me well.
Why, by a month into the semester, did everyone in my PSY 1 section know that I am an Orthodox Jew? Why do I have a compulsive need to alert the people around me to my religious identity? It boils down to a few reasons.
Sometimes, the situation just forces me to explain my practices to avoid confusion in the future. Several times during the week leading up to Halloween, people would ask me what my plans were for the holiday, and I felt the urge to describe my religious identity in response to questions like “What are you doing for Halloween?” (answer: “nothing”). No matter the week, I cannot work or answer any texts for the duration of the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. So I always know that when a group project is assigned, I must soon explain that although it may seem like it, I am not ghosting my partners for 25 hours each week.
In some cases, I feel like I need to tell people that I am religious in order to avoid embarrassment or exclusion. While the people around me talk about their favorite Jefe’s orders — which I have never tried because they are not prepared according to Kashrut, the specific dietary and food preparation requirements of Judaism — I feel an urge to justify my lack of participation. “It isn’t that I live under a rock,” I want to yell, “or that I don’t like Mexican food! I just can’t eat at Jefe’s!”
These are cultural phenomena, woven into the fabric of a typical college student’s life, that I am clued into but will never be able to experience fully. My observance of the Sabbath and Kashrut will always dictate my lack of participation in many conversations about Friday night football games and bad dining hall dishes. Harvard’s dining halls, in particular, are designed to breed friendship and a sense of community. When the only foods in the Lowell House dining hall that I can eat are microwave meals, fruit, and cereal, I am hardly spurred to show up three times a day, meaning I lose out on auxiliary social benefits. Similar phenomena occur almost daily, guaranteeing that the quintessential Harvard experience will always be out of my reach.
However, inconveniences notwithstanding, the majority of the times in which I bring up religion in public are because of my unabashed identity as a Jew. I take a tremendous amount of pride in the way my identity distinguishes me — kosher food, special mode of dress, holy day observance, and all — and makes me feel fulfilled. I mention my religious affiliation in conversation when it arises, not out of a sense of duty, but because I wish to.
Before Harvard, I was introduced to the philosophy of “Halakhic Man” by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, in which he argues that the legal and ethical principles of Judaism should govern every aspect of a Jew’s life. I grew up in a relatively insular religious environment, where I attended school and associated almost entirely with other Orthodox Jews; the way of life that Rabbi Soloveitchik described was almost a given. However, at Harvard, the halakhic lifestyle governed by Jewish law and tradition is anything but spoon-fed. I spend hours of my day praying and studying religious texts, trying to uphold myself to the standards that I hold dear.
The practices that take up so much of my time are things that I care deeply about, and they naturally bleed into my social and academic life. I could note the connection between the Book of Esther and Arabian Nights — both involve an insomnia-ridden king who cycles through hundreds of suitors — to myself, but it is much more satisfying to do so aloud in section. When asked in an icebreaker what I do for self-care, I could say I was working out or spending time with friends, or I could mention the 25-hour period each Sabbath in which all of the distractions of my day-to-day life melt away. Time and time again, I reveal my Jewish identity to the people around me, gaining a bit more confidence in the confession each time.
Judaism values the concept of a “Kiddush Hashem,” literally translated as “sanctifying God.” It refers to behaving in such a way publicly that people around you recognize that positive actions you perform are due to your religious identity. My teachers and mentors have told me that my existence as an Orthodox Jew at Harvard is a living example of this philosophy. My Jewish life on campus isn’t just the moments of impassioned spirituality, but also those of alienation. I would like to suggest that this idea bears greatly on religious students on this campus overall. Be proud of your faith. Talk about it, write about it, bring it up in class, because that might be what gets you through the next moment of religious isolation.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
More than 100 students walked out of embattled Harvard professor John L. Comaroff’s class Tuesday afternoon, protesting his continued presence on campus after he was placed on leave last year for violating the University’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Students flooded Comaroff’s classroom in Northwest Building classroom B108 — overflowing into the hallway — to protest the first lecture of his class African and African-American Studies 172X: “Colonialism and its Postcolonial/Decolonial Afterlives: Critical Readings.”
As Comaroff began to speak, students rose from their seats and filed out of the classroom, chanting, “Justice for survivors,” and “No more Comaroff, no more complicity.”
As the walkout begin, Comaroff, a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology, broke into a smile and nodded at the protesters. As the last students left the classroom, one told the professor, “Smile in hell, asshole.”
The walkout was organized by members of Our Harvard Can Do Better and the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers’ Feminist Working Group. Students associated with Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard and the Student Labor Action Movement also attended the protest.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and University president-elect Claudine Gay placed Comaroff on unpaid administrative leave for the spring 2022 semester after two internal investigations found that Comaroff violated Harvard’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Comaroff returned to the classroom for the fall 2022 semester, and his first class faced a similar walkout and protest.
Gay first put Comaroff on paid leave in 2020 after an investigation by The Crimson found that at least three female graduate students had contacted Harvard’s Title IX office with complaints of harassment and professional retaliation against the professor.
Comaroff’s class — which began at 3 p.m. — was nearly empty within 10 minutes, with only two other individuals remaining. Three students were enrolled in the course as of Tuesday morning, per the FAS Registrar’s office. The other course that Comaroff teaches, African and African American Studies 190X: “The Anthropology of Law,” has one student enrolled.
Protesters chanted, “Time’s up,” and “Shut it down,” as they marched to the Barker Center, where several taped posters and pages from a 2022 lawsuit filed against Harvard to his office door. The lawsuit, filed against the school by Anthropology graduate students Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava, alleges that Harvard ignored and mishandled allegations of sexual harassment against Comaroff.
A plainclothes Harvard University Police Department officer at the Barker Center declined to comment.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the presence of officers at the walkout, citing a longstanding department policy not to comment on personnel and security measures.
Austin Siebold ’23, who said she was the first to flag Comaroff’s courses to the walkout’s organizers, said she learned he was teaching this semester after scrolling through Harvard’s course catalog.
“I saw this class, it was on colonialism, postcolonialism and decolonialism, and I thought that sounded really interesting and it fit on my schedule,” she said. “And then I clicked on it and it was taught by John Comaroff and I was like, ‘Holy.’”
Siebold then reached out to activist groups to help plan the event.
“I enrolled in the class and used information I was able to gather from that to help me plan this,” she said. “I was the first person in that room.”
Our Harvard Can Do Better — an organization focused on combating campus rape culture — described Comaroff’s continued presence at the University as “shameful” and called for his resignation in a statement endorsing the walkout.
“This man is not safe to interact with undergraduate students,” said organizer Rebecca S. Araten ’23.
“Harvard is marketed as a place where all students should be able to succeed and get the best education in the world. And the reality is that our campus promotes a culture of sexual abuse, a culture of misogyny and harassment and discrimination,” added Rosalie P. Couture ’26, another organizer.
In an emailed statement, Comaroff’s attorneys Norman S. Zalkin, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, and Janet E. Halley wrote that Comaroff “categorically denies that he ought to resign” and that he “is doing nothing to create unsafe conditions for any Harvard student.”
“He is fully authorized to teach Harvard students who sign up for his courses,” they wrote, adding “the claim that he poses a danger is ludicrous in light of the actual facts.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
Tenzin R. Gund-Morrow ’26, a Crimson editorial editor, said he hopes a new administration will bring changes to the University’s policies around handling allegations of harassment and misconduct by faculty.
“I’m just hoping that with any change in the administration, there will be some shift in the policy,” Gund-Morrow said. “But obviously, as the organizers said, that is sadly a low chance.”
Hannah L. Munzberg ’25, who attended the demonstration, said seeing so many other students protesting made her “hopeful.”
“It’s nice to see that it’s not just me that’s angry,” Munzberg said.
Koby D. Ljunggren, president of HGSU-UAW and a Ph.D. candidate in biophysics, said they were “so proud of our undergrads for collectively getting together and planning this.”
“It really warms my heart,” they said.
Ljunggren added that while the protest “might be symbolic in nature,” continued pressure on the University is critical.
Kilburn, another plaintiff in the lawsuit against Harvard, tweeted that she “wept” upon seeing photos of the protest.
“Because no one should have to go through what I went through with John Comaroff to get an education,” Kilburn wrote. “Because Harvard was warned about Comaroff and did nothing, but these students are making sure warnings reach everyone.”

Students postered the door and walls surrounding Northwest B108, the classroom where Comaroff teaches, with signs calling for his resignation.
Students began to file out of Comaroff’s classroom at 3 p.m., chanting slogans like “No more Comaroff, no more complicity.”
Signs in the Northwest basement brand Comaroff as an abuser, condemning the University’s decision to allow the embattled professor back into the classroom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard’s admissions lawsuit unfolds at the Supreme Court, Massachusetts District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs unsealed parts of 2018 Harvard admissions courtroom transcripts of private conversations between the judge and the lawyers — known as sidebars — last month.
Harvard law professor Jeannie C. Suk Gersen filed a request to unseal on Nov. 11, arguing that the high-profile case required greater transparency. Several days after Gersen, The New York Times and the New Yorker — for which Gersen is a contributing writer — also filed in support of unsealing the sidebars.
“When I went to go look at the transcripts back from 2018 to try to make sure I had a complete record of what happened at trial, I discovered that all of the sidebars were sealed, and that certainly is not normal,” Gersen said in an interview with The Crimson. “In fact, I can hardly think of other civil cases where a blanket sealing of every single sidebar of a trial would have occurred.”
Some transcript excerpts from the sixth, seventh, and tenth days of the three-week trial between Harvard and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which alleges that the College discriminates against Asian American applicants, remain sealed.
Ten days after the Dec. 19 order to unseal, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed an appeal, stating that the “undefined category” of applicant information is not “sensitive enough to overcome the presumption of access.” On Jan. 11, the New Yorker filed another letter of appeal.
Burroughs said in her decision that the Court weighed the “sensitivity of the information, the nature and degree of the harm, the reliability of the information, and the interest that the public has in the information” when deciding which sidebars should be unsealed.
The sealed transcripts include an email exchange between Thomas J. Hibino, director of the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, and William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, dean of Admissions and Financial Aid.
According to Burroughs, Hibino’s email contained a “joke memo” written as if a Harvard admissions officer was “inappropriately satirizing” Asian American applicants.
Hibino had previously headed the investigation of Harvard College’s admissions process for discrimination against Asian American applicants. Burroughs did not specify the date the email was sent.
“The material is dated, it implicates the interests of a third party who was never cross-examined at trial, and its relevance to the case is limited only to the Dean’s response, which shall be unsealed,” Burroughs wrote.
“Further, the offensive attempt at humor includes inappropriate and inflammatory language that does not need to be repeated or aired,” Burroughs added. “The specific words used are not relevant to the case — the salient information is the recipient’s reaction to the email, which will be unsealed.”
In response to Hibino’s email, Fitzsimmons wrote, “I’m stunned. This person passed away a few years ago, and I had forgotten she had such a sense of humor. Will deconstruct at lunch. Where should we go?”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the decision or Fitzsimmons’ response.
In a Nov. 15 letter to Burroughs, Harvard lawyer Seth P. Waxman ’73 requested that trial transcripts containing sidebars remain sealed to protect “personal and confidential information.”
On Nov. 17, SFFA filed a letter agreeing that identifying information should remain sealed, but opposed Harvard’s blanket request to keep the sidebars sealed.
“SFFA had no objections to unsealing,” SFFA President Edward J. Blum said in an emailed statement to The Crimson on Friday.
Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard in the 2018 admissions trial, striking down allegations of discrimination against Asian Americans in the College’s admissions process.
“I was surprised that Harvard objected to unsealing the sidebars because it really had been four years since the trial,” Gersen said. “And the case is now at the Supreme Court of the United States.”
The Supreme Court is expected to hand down a decision ending race-conscious admissions in higher education in early spring or summer.

The Center for Labor and a Just Economy, a Harvard Law School research and policy initiative focusing on worker advocacy and labor law, launched Tuesday morning in a webinar featuring panelists from the Department of Labor and National Education Association.
The center revamps and expands the former Labor and Worklife Program, established by the Law School in 2002 to “examine critical changes in labor markets, labor law, and the experiences of working people” and “analyze the role of advocates, unions, worker organizations, business, and government in improving the quality of life for working families in the U.S. and around the world.”
The program was relaunched in hopes of focusing work at the center on developing new strategies to bolster worker advocacy and reimagining American labor laws.
“We are looking to develop — in collaboration with folks from across the labor movement, academia, worker advocacy — new strategies for empowering workers so that the economy and our democracy will be more fair,” the center’s executive director Sharon Block said.
The center will now include the Workers’ Capital Project, while continuing to host the Harvard Trade Union Program, which existed under the Labor and Worklife Program.
The virtual launch event was hosted by Block and moderated by Eleanor Mueller, a Labor reporter at Politico. The panel featured HLS professor Benjamin I. Sachs, who serves as a faculty co-director at the center; Joelle Gamble, Chief Economist at the Department of Labor; Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association; and Jose Garcia, Director of the Future of Work(ers) team at the Ford Foundation. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also offered pre-recorded remarks.
During the webinar, panelists stressed the importance of unions and organizing.
“This country needs unions,” Pringle said. “Our workers need that collective voice and advocacy, so that they not only can participate in a just economy, but they have just working conditions and education.”
Sachs said the center will study and strategize on labor policy, with an early focus on how federal preemption rules can be relaxed on labor law to give states and cities “more breathing room” to craft labor laws around unionization.
“The mission of the center is to reimagine American labor laws to enable working people to rebuild the economy and politics in a more equitable fashion,” Sachs added.
Block said a key feature of previous HLS labor law projects was “bringing together lots of different kinds of expertise” — including perspectives from policymakers and union organizers — to come up with “the best answer.”
In a set of recorded remarks, Warren thanked members of the center for their “tireless efforts” in past years to “empower working people.”
“Over the past two years, we've made a lot of progress to support workers and hold corporations accountable for abuses,” Warren said. “The work you do here at the center is a key piece of the puzzle.”

Actress Jennifer Coolidge will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 73rd Woman of the Year, the organization announced on Tuesday.
Coolidge’s acting career spans three decades and includes roles as Stifler’s mom in “American Pie” and indispensable stylist and best friend Paulette Bonafonté Parcelle in “Legally Blonde,” which is set at Harvard Law School.
Most recently, Coolidge acted as unraveling millionaire Tanya on the television drama “The White Lotus,” winning the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress, as well as two Critics’ Choice Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award.
Coolidge also played the role of Fiona Montgomery in “A Cinderella Story,” which garnered her a Teen Choice Award.
Previous recipients of the Woman of the Year award include actresses Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Kerry Washington, Viola Davis, and last year’s Woman of the Year, Jennifer Garner.
In the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ press release, Hasty Pudding Man and Woman of the Year coordinator Maya M. Dubin ’23 said Coolidge’s “glittering personality and comedic presence are so Pudding.”
“We are so excited to welcome Jennifer Coolidge back to her hometown and to Harvard, the iconic setting of Legally Blonde,” Dubin said.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals producer Sarah L. Mann ’23 said in the release that it is an “absolute dream” to honor Coolidge with the award.
“We know our Pudding Pot will look phenomenal alongside her new Golden Globe, and we swear we won’t whisk her away to a palazzo in Palermo!” said Mann, in reference to the Sicilian setting of the second season of “The White Lotus.”
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals was founded in 1844, and it is the third-oldest theatrical group in the world. The group annually stages a musical production which is entirely written and performed by students.
The organization’s tradition of naming and celebrating a Woman of the Year began in 1951, and its first recipient was English actress Gertrude Lawrence.
The ceremony itself — which is set for Feb. 4 — consists of a parade through Harvard Square led by Coolidge, a celebratory roast of the actress, and the presentation of a “Pudding Pot” award. Similar festivities on Feb. 2 will honor actor Bob Odenkirk, the Hasty Pudding’s 2023 Man of the Year.
“We know she’ll fit right into the Pudding’s musical spectacular, though she’ll still have to earn her Pudding Pot on stage,” said Dubin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts legislators reintroduced a bill Friday to establish a civil right to request medical care during encounters with police.
The Medical Civil Rights Act would require Massachusetts police officers to “immediately request emergency medical services” when someone in police custody or contact experiences a medical emergency. The bill was first presented before the Massachusetts legislature in February 2021 but did not make it out of committee for a vote.
The bill’s refiling on Friday by State Senator Elizabeth “Liz” Miranda and State Representative Jon Santiago follows years of advocacy by the Medical Civil Rights Initiative, a group that works to pass similar legislation across the United States.
“It’s not necessarily that we identified 2023 as a key year, but it’s taken us this long to gain some support and to be able to have communications with legislators with different constituencies,” said Leonore A. Dluhy ’92, the initiative’s director. “It’s not been an easy road.”
If the bill is passed, Massachusetts would be the first state to guarantee the right to request medical care during a police encounter. Similar bills have been put forward in Maine and Connecticut, though the Connecticut bill failed in 2022.
Dluhy, who helped draft the bill, said the law is critically important to protecting those who interact with police officers, adding that some officers are “deliberately indifferent” to their medical needs.
“Do you want a statutory protection, or do you want to be at the discretion of an officer who’s not a trained medical professional to determine whether or not you have a right to medical care?” Dluhy said.
The bill’s reintroduction comes after the police killing of Sayed Faisal, a 20-year-old college student and Cambridge resident, earlier this month. According to a Cambridge Police Department press release, officers responded to a 911 call that described Faisal harming himself. When he allegedly approached officers while wielding a knife after a five-block foot chase, an officer shot and killed him.
A surge of protests from residents followed the killing, with many activists calling for CPD reform and pushing for non-police public safety alternatives, calling for medical professionals to respond to mental health crises instead of police.
Henry L. “Hank” Dorkin, a member of the initiative, said there is a sharp distinction between the Medical Civil Rights Act and calls for reallocation of funds from police.
“This in no way is considered to be defunding the police,” Dorkin said.
Dluhy started work on the initiative with her father, an internal medicine physician, in 2015 in response to the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while in Baltimore Police custody.
Malcolm P. “Mac” Rogers, a psychiatrist with the initiative, said police are ill-equipped to handle mental health emergencies.
“I do think the police generally try to do the right thing, but these are complicated situations,” said Rogers, a Harvard Medical School graduate. “And unfortunately, a number of those situations tend to escalate in the wrong direction.”
The Medical Civil Rights Act “importantly lowers the threshold for law enforcement individuals to seek medical evaluations in those situations,” he added.
“When there’s an egregious wrong, you look for a remedy,” said Frederick L. Brown ’54, a retired Massachusetts Appeals Court justice on the initiative.
Dorkin, a pediatric pulmonologist, said the costs from implementing the Medical Civil Rights Act would be considerably less than the costs to taxpayers from police-involved deaths.
Dluhy also said the bill affects a wide swath of Americans, citing Department of Justice statistics that showed more than 80,000 arrests in Massachusetts in 2021. She added that individuals often encounter police officers in medical emergencies.
“In order for us to move forward in this state, we need every person to be invested in the fact that this bill pertains to them,” Dluhy said.

The Cambridge Charter Review Committee — tasked by the Cambridge City Council with recommending changes to the city’s charter — convened for its first public forum at the Cambridge Public Library Tuesday evening to discuss election procedures and civic engagement.
Comprising 15 Cambridge residents from diverse backgrounds selected by the Council, the committee has met internally once or twice every month since August to discuss reforming the city’s plan of government. The committee fielded several public comments Tuesday night concerning the short turnaround of the current two-year Council terms and the mayoral election process.
The last major updates to the charter occurred over 80 years ago when the city adopted the ‘Plan E’ government structure, in which an elected council selects a mayor to serve as a council chair and a city manager who oversees the day-to-day operation of the city, budget, and departments.
More than 20 residents attended the forum, including Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, who said she was “disappointed” by the low turnout in an interview after the forum.
On the other hand, committee member and lecturer at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design James G. Stockard Jr. said the turnout at Tuesday’s meeting was uncharacteristically high.
“All of our meetings so far have been on Zoom,” he said. “There’s more people here tonight than we’ve had in any of those meetings.”
Many forum attendees decried the city’s lack of news and education for voters, with local resident Heather Hoffman saying that Cambridge’s government is “way too often opaque.”
“So often, people in the city government think that ‘If we actually tell people what we’re doing, they will just organize against us,’” Hoffman said. “That could well be, and that maybe suggests that you are doing things that we don’t like, and that they are not necessarily for everyone’s good.”
Others questioned whether the committee could develop recommendations for charter amendments and conduct meaningful outreach by its Council-imposed June deadline.
“When is all this outreach? When is this rich dialogue? When is this informed citizenry going to be making informed decisions?” asked resident Mary Jane Kornacki. “I’m just saying that the short timeframe you have seems designed to do something short of robust civic engagement.”
Committee member Stockard said, in an interview following the forum that the committee will “very likely” request an extension and deliver its recommendations in the fall.
Charter Review Project Manager Anna K. Corning said she was pleased with local residents’ comments during the forum.
“It was great to start these conversations and hear some of the feedback from the community about what we can be doing better, and some of the steps we can be taking to engage more of the community,” she said.
The next charter review public forum will take place over Zoom on Feb. 4.

Now that Starbucks is back in the Square, it feels like all is well again…
Situated in the Abbot Building between the Yard and the River Houses, our new Starbucks location is spectacular. As you head for your pick-me-up beverage, you will no longer have any excuse to put off your weekly CVS haul or any of your other errands. How convenient! Not only is the location convenient, Starbucks’ hours are pleasantly surprising (it’s open until 9 p.m. all week!) Gone are the days of craving a late night peppermint mocha or matcha green tea latte and being severely disappointed when finding that Starbucks closed at 7:30 p.m. You can now fuel your unhealthy coffee addiction 16-ish hours a day, 7 days a week!
Vibes :)
Arezoo: The vibes of this Starbucks are absolutely adorable — being greeted by soft, ambient music along with a blast of warm air and the smell of coffee beans definitely perked me up after a day full of back-to-back sections. I think that the smaller size of the cafe adds to its homey feel, and makes it perfect to quickly stop by between classes.
Subul: It is a compact but super cute establishment. You can definitely tell it’s a brand-new, recent addition to the area by the clean and modern look of the place, and it makes it very inviting! There are no spaces to sit or work, so it’s more of a grab-and-go coffee shop. The chitter-chatter of people waiting, and the hustle and bustle of others quickly getting their drinks creates a lively atmosphere — and makes for a great people-watching experience.
Drinks
Arezoo: In the spirit of the holiday season, I ordered a grande iced sugar cookie almond milk latte. This drink can be a hit or miss, but today it was definitely a major hit! The drink was perfectly sweet, and the added red and green sprinkles made it even better (aesthetics matter!). They ran out of almond milk but were quick to offer up many alternatives, including oat milk, which I ultimately chose. Would 10/10 recommend this drink to put you in the winter spirit!
Subul: I celebrated the beginning of the holiday season by ordering a caramel brulée latte, and words cannot describe how phenomenal it was. It hit the spot, and I am still dreaming about it. I should probably branch out and try another holiday drink, but every part of me wants to continue ordering the caramel brulée latte again and again. We could all use a dose of serotonin when our routines get robotic and our days get cold, and I cannot recommend this drink enough.
Speed
Arezoo: I knew that the store would probably be busy, but I did not anticipate anywhere near the line that I found when I visited. Since it was Red Cup Day, people of all ages flocked to the new Starbucks. Despite this, I was very impressed with how the staff was able to handle the number of customers. Not to mention that they had enough red cups to last them until 4:30 p.m. — but they did run out five minutes before I got to the front of the line though. R.I.P.
Subul: I went the day after opening, and I braced myself for a long line. Fortunately there was no wait when I went after my 9 a.m. class. Since I ordered ahead, my beautiful drink was waiting for me at the pickup station. Spotting my name on a drink label at the Starbucks counter is one of the top 10 best feelings in life, and the sheer joy set me up for a successful day. Shoutout to the baristas for their efficiency and timeliness. Flyby loves you <3.
Customer Service
Arezoo: When coffee shops ask for my name, as someone with the name Arezoo, I usually panic. It is never worth the extra long interaction of repeating myself or spelling it out for workers, but today felt different. When I approached the counter, the barista was so patient and took the time to perfect the drink label, even with the crazy line behind me. They even pronounced it right when putting it on the counter! The baristas were super nice and it was so exciting to have my own name (spelled correctly) on the side of the cup. It made my day!
Subul: I’m not gonna lie, my interaction with the barista lasted about a minute. But it was a lovely minute. The staff greeted and acknowledged every person who entered, and their kindness was much appreciated. A little kindness goes a long way on a hectic day. I look forward to coming back and getting to know the baristas better because they seem like a great bunch.
Overall Rating
Arezoo: I had a fantastic experience at the new Starbucks and would definitely recommend it to others who are looking for a warm drink before walking (in the cold) to class, or even just as an excuse to go on a little walk around the Square. To coffee addicts and non-coffee drinkers of all kinds, a visit is definitely worth your time!
Subul: Five stars. You will definitely find me regularly visiting this Starbucks for its immaculate vibes, flavorful drinks and fabulous customer service. It truly has it all, and I couldn’t be happier that Starbucks has returned to the Square. Petition for Starbucks to start accepting BoardPlus or even a student discount?!
