After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The introductory ethics course offered this fall in the philosophy department—Philosophy 13: Morality and its Critics—does not fulfill the General Education requirement for Ethical Reasoning. Let that sink in for a moment. An introductory course in ethics does not constitute a course in ethical reasoning.
How can this be?
As most students would agree, the Gen Ed program is an imperfect system that needs some reform. Its worst critics contend that the courses are too large, the selection too narrow, and the content watered down. While I don’t hold such negative opinions, I do believe that the program often feels more a burden and inconvenience than a rewarding means to a well-rounded education. The problem boils down to too few courses satisfying requirements—counting Philosophy 13 and other sensible courses will be a helpful step in remedying a flawed system.
The overarching philosophy of the General Education accords well with a liberal arts education. As former Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, once said, “A well-educated man must know a little bit of everything and one thing well.” A holistic educational experience necessitates that students be exposed to a variety of subjects. Further, students should leave Harvard as better informed and prepared citizens, with the ability to respond critically to change, to understand the ethical consequences of their actions, and to  “understand themselves as products of, and participants in, traditions of art, ideas, and value.”
However, the General Education program becomes flawed as a result of attempting to differentiate itself from mere distributional requirements. In valuing courses that it deems applicable for students beyond graduation, the program ends up severely restricting which courses satisfy the requirements. The application process—in which faculty members must submit proposals in order for their courses to count—also narrows the Gen Ed course offerings.
Instead, the program should allow its goals to emanate naturally from the courses.
A liberal arts curriculum has intrinsic value: Students become better thinkers and citizens by taking well-taught courses in a broad range of subjects. There’s no need to impose additional criteria on how a course should specifically teach us these things. A course that teaches Socrates’ theory on the unity of the virtues should tangentially, though certainly not explicitly, help inform students’ abilities to understand ethical problems in their lives. (This course, Philosophy 101, also does not count towards Ethical Reasoning.)
In limiting what courses count towards the requirements, the General Education program effectively funnels students into overly large courses, which dilutes course quality. It gives students fewer options and often forces them to take courses just to fill requirements.
My suggestion is simple: Harvard should broaden what counts for General Education requirements. The primary objective of the General Education program should be to have students engage with material from different disciplines and for students to take away important life skills. Most Harvard courses fall under one of the current eight Gen Ed categories. They should be counted as such.
There’s no reason why almost every English class should not count for Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding; Economics 1010 should count towards United States and the World, most sociology courses should count towards Societies in the World, and so on.
While this broad expansion shifts the program towards a more distributional system, it better achieves the worthy goals of General Education and has many benefits. Larger courses will become smaller, and students will have more choice when selecting courses. Also important, if Harvard allows more departmental courses to count, students will have the ability to delve into the different departments directly.
This change certainly has implications that need to be worked out, such as whether specific departments can handle larger enrollments. However, it would not be such a radical upheaval: Current courses in the Gen Ed would remain as they are. The additional courses that count towards requirements would serve to supplement them.
At the end of the spring semester, a committee of 10 faculty members will release a review of the General Education Program, the first review of its kind since the program’s inception in 2007. Gen Ed reform needs to take place, and broadening what courses counts towards requirements is a good place to begin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, Boston Globe columnist Tom Keane put forth a well-reasoned argument regarding the abolition of tipping in restaurants in favor of a fixed service charge. Keane is right: For a more just economy and a better culture of customer service, tipping should be abolished.
Tipping culture creates a system in which servers are functionally cheated of their right to a minimum wage. Unlike other workers, waiters and waitresses can legally be paid at a minimum of just over two dollars an hour, with the assumption that they will make the rest in tips. In theory and law, servers can be compensated by their employers if their tips fail to garner them the regular minimum wage. Large numbers of servers, however, appear to be earning well below the federal minimum wage, with many living in poverty. This could be due to a power differential, or perhaps workers are unaware that they can ask for enough money, and so consequently end up not making a minimum wage. Tipping exploits these workers by enabling employers to pay less than the legal amount, knowing that they will often not have to make up the difference.
As Keane points out, tipping is not even the most effective method to ensure good service. First, because tips come at the end of the meal, there is no way by which an employee can rectify his or her behavior or better suit it to customers’ desires. Second, because customers are often not regulars, it is hard to foresee those desires appropriately. Third, most people have a general percentage of amount that they tip; seniors and students, for instance, traditionally tip less than middle-aged men, so waiters and waitresses might be more inclined to provide disproportionate service to those who are likely to give them more money. Finally, waiters and waitresses may recognize that those who are paying more for their meals will consequently pay bigger tips, and so might serve them faster as well. The claim that tipping culture engenders better service seems dubious at best.
It is critical that employers at the very least meet the federal minimum wage, which itself is already in many places too low. A living wage is key, and as long as tipping allows employers to shirk their responsibility to provide this wage, it should not remain a policy in the United States. Rather, it should be replaced by a policy like a fixed service charge that gives workers the proper amount of payment while concurrently does just as much as tipping to ensure that good service is provided.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social media is a depressing place these days, largely thanks to the failure of two grand juries to indict police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men. At this point, many Americans are fed up, angry, hopeless, or some combination of the three. Opinion pieces have cropped up bearing the message that America has always been a land of white supremacy, and will likely remain that way. Interviewed in a New York Times blog piece, philosopher Shannon Sullivan described the task of people fighting racial oppression as “absurd.” Even Jon Stewart could not muster any jokes after a Staten Island grand jury failed to indict the police officer who put Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold.
Pessimism does, indeed, seem warranted. But as Sullivan’s comment in the New York Times makes clear, too much pessimism brings with it the danger of undermining the cause of reform. Too many want to ascribe the deaths of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, and countless others to immutable forces outside the control of government policy, not likely to change anytime soon.
One period of American history that offers some lessons for the promises and pitfalls of movements to uproot entrenched social ills is Reconstruction, the 15 years from 1863 to 1877 during which the North attempted to reconfigure the South’s society and politics away from slavery. Reconstruction is a useful touchstone because it remains the mother of all such reform efforts: the attempt of the country to reunite itself and integrate 4 million new citizens whose humanity was not recognized for the nation’s first century.
Reconstruction is also instructive because very little was off the table. Everything from serious federal civil rights laws and the encouragement of black voting to even land redistribution saw serious consideration. In the immediate aftermath of slavery, people knew that racial and economic disparities were closely related, and deserved attention together.
The results of this effort were, of course, mixed. Congress did not give land to former slaves, but through the Freedman’s Bureau it worked to make public education available. Some of these initiatives also had advantages for poor whites, and Congress worked with Republican-controlled state governments to make progress on civil rights.
Reconstruction’s ultimate impermanence had numerous causes, but chief among them was the North’s unwillingness to address its own racism, the backlash of Southern whites, and the corruption of the federal and state governments. Later historians may have exaggerated this last factor, but it underscores the extent to which government policy depends on government competence. As Rutgers history professor James Goodman has pointed out, a belief that “government had an obligation to join the struggle for equality” was a prerequisite not just for Reconstruction, but also for the Civil Rights movement 100 years later. The end of Reconstruction, of course, would lead eventually to Jim Crow and separate but equal.
What does this history have to do with our current racial problems? First, the issues raised by police violence in communities of color implicate more than just racial prejudice, but also the economic and educational disparities that go along with it.
Because of the extreme nature of the Civil War and its aftermath, Reconstruction was one of a few periods in which Americans grappled with these connections to implement comprehensive solutions. Today, such a program would involve once again making the funding of public education more equitable, pursuing a more robust course of federal intervention against local civil rights abuses, and bringing far more voices of color to the policy-making table.
Another key lesson of Reconstruction is that government can begin to address significant social issues. Today, young people especially have a deep mistrust of government. But to forge a more equitable social compact, we need to maintain a belief that, working with the public, government can create more just institutions.
Finally, democracy is a team sport. In his history of the period, W.E.B. Du Bois, Class of 1890, argued for the key role played by African-Americans during Reconstruction, and further made the case that the ultimate failure of Reconstruction had to do with the lack of unity between poor Southern whites and freed slaves. Today, a similar analysis would underscore the need for coalition-building to ensure that current movements do not succumb to the same racial divisions.
Reconstruction is not a perfect analogy for today’s troubles. Most crucially, the North has its own history of racial animosity that is relevant to any discussion of American racism. But the point of looking to Reconstruction is that the kind of concerted effort at political and social reform undertaken so explicitly in the South in the 1860s and ‘70s, and in the 1960s during the Civil Rights era, is needed once again throughout the country.
That kind of movement will require faith that society and government, working in concert, can make America a country that lives up to its ideals. This movement may already be afoot, and it will require hardheaded political realism to implement actual policies. But more than anything, it will require hope that the United States can, in the spirit of Gettysburg and Selma, have “a new birth of freedom” for all its people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past semester, while working for an online women’s magazine, I found myself heavily drawn to writing about feminist issues. By virtue of being a woman with strong opinions on the subject, I blindly considered myself an expert. I was quick to hail things like positive beauty campaigns as feminist and arraign others as anti-feminist, or sexist, if they bordered on archaic representations of femininity.
All that changed last Monday when I was asked to write about a recent advertising campaign for Fairlife Milk, a Coca Cola subsidiary, which features a number of nearly nude women covered in everyone’s favorite calcium source. By that time, the media had already denounced the article for multiple counts of sexism, so I prepared myself to be equally shocked and enraged upon viewing the campaign. Try as I might, however, I could not seem to find anything wrong with it. To me it was clear that the advertisements were a nostalgic homage to the old-fashioned pin-up girls featured in 1940s Coke advertisements rather than some regressive attempt to depict the ideal woman in a degrading and hyper-sexualized manner.
In the midst of trying to grapple with whether or not my interpretation was correct, whether these advertisements were in fact sexist or simply celebrating the female form, it finally dawned on me that there could be a gray area. What may come across as sexist, or anti-feminist, to one person might not translate the same way in the case of another. Still, I could not reconcile this idea with the definition of feminism I had come to champion over the years, the one promulgated by the likes of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Emma Watson.
If feminism really is synonymous with gender equality (and it is), how could there be any confusion as to what is or is not equal? Moreover, anything suggesting the inequality of the sexes has to be anti-feminist by default. The problem is, while feminism in theory is simple enough to define, feminism in action is far more nebulous. Of course, there are certain phenomena such as the gender pay gap that we can all agree are undeniably discriminatory, but not all issues are this categorical, as evidenced by my response to the Fairlife Milk campaign.
The trouble with our current society is that we are obsessed with compartmentalizing things into definitive categories or labels. We are the hashtag generation; we feel the need to compress the entirety of an image or sentiment into a simple set of words. We throw around words like ‘feminist’ or ‘racist’ because they are provocative and recognizable, but, in doing so, we fail to realize the binary we have created, in which you are either feminist or anti-feminist, racist or tolerant, liberal or conservative.
This is not to say that we should do away with “isms” altogether. As a writer and English major, I am an ardent believer in the power of language and a respectful admirer of the heavy histories that accompany words like “racism,” “feminism,” or “sexism.” But perhaps it is time to shift our focus away from obsessing over definitions and toward the actions that these definitions aim to represent. Or, if we continue to emphasize these umbrella terms, perhaps we should do so with a more careful understanding of the ambiguities that arise in their application.
The most important thing to consider is whether these words serve a constructive purpose beyond categorization, for they will have little use if they continue to hover in headlines without the power to effect change. Instead, we should view language as a call to action rather than getting bogged down with determining who or what is or is not feminist, sexist, or racist. After all, while I would love to see certain starlets such as Shailene Woodley and Carrie Underwood claim the term “feminism” for the benefit of their young female fans, I would much rather see them on the frontlines fighting for gender equality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of students and affiliates lay on the cold ground outside of Memorial Church Sunday morning as part of a die-in protest, inspired by the decisions not to charge two white police officers whose actions led to the deaths of black, unarmed men this summer. Attendants of the usual 11:00 a.m. Sunday church service stepped slowly through the still bodies, and many stopped to take pictures or join in the demonstration.
The event followed weeks of protests nationwide and on campus over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Brown was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson, Mo. police officer, in August. Garner died in July after being put in a chokehold by Daniel Pantaleo, a white New York City police officer.
“I see it as my job to create the conditions of robust moral dialogue and debate,” Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton said in an interview before his Sunday Memorial Church service. “What is right? What is good? What is just? Many of us from across faith traditions operate from the fundamental assumption that lethal force against unarmed citizens does not meet the standards of a democratic society.”
Walton added that he thinks the deaths of Brown and Garner raise deeper concerns than just questions over innocence or guilt, such as a “criminal justice system run amok” and “broken windows policing.”
Walton gave a sermon as part of the regularly scheduled Sunday service, where he urged attendants, as Christians, to act against what he called a “cruel blood ritual in the name of public safety” and the use of prisons for “social control.”
After a long applause and standing ovation, Walton departed Memorial Church to meet a crowd of students for the die-in outside. Most students bore surgical masks that read “I can’t breathe,” a reference to the dying words of Garner. Many students had worn similar masks as a sign of solidarity on Friday.
“People actually, when they see the dead bodies, they read and remember, as well as walk over and [are] forced to feel it,” said Robert Rush ’18, who helped organize the “die in.”
Other attendants said they felt they needed to participate in the event to demonstrate their alliance with the movement.
“I think it’s important as a non-African American population to show our support for the movements, to be what they call ‘white allies,’" said Jimena Villar de Onis, a student at the School of Public Health. “It’s always important for us to tell them that they [have] support all around the U.S. and all around the world.”
In his speech to students at the die-in, Walton, often drawing applause, referenced racial profiling and police violence in his own youth and said there is continued need for discussions today.
“We remain here,” Walton said. “We remain here, many of us afraid because we see democracy becoming further and further unhinged.”
Walton reiterated many of the “larger, systemic problems” he mentioned in his Memorial Church sermon and urged students to take action, pressing them to ask what they would contribute to the fight against injustice.
“Some of you here, you’re going to law school,”  Walton said at the end of his speech to the students. “Some of you here will be members of congress. Some of you here will be in high finance. What will you do?”

Canaday Hall, one of Harvard’s 17 freshman dormitories, is scheduled for a facilities upgrade this week that will replace just under 200 light bulbs with more energy-efficient light bulbs throughout the building.
The new bulbs will be placed in Canaday’s common spaces, including the bathrooms, laundry and common rooms, and the Harvard College Women’s Center in the Canaday basement.
According to a flyer handed out at a study break in Canaday on Friday, the transition to LED lighting will save 8,395 kilowatts of power every year. This will save more than $1,000 and eliminate 5,758 kilograms of carbon dioxide annually.
The initiative was led by the Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program through Green ’18, a group of students in the freshman class who focus on campus sustainability issues. Green ’18 collaborated with the Office of Physical Resources and Planning, the Freshman Dean’s Office, Yard Operations, and the Faculty of Arts and Science Green Program.
Clifford F. W. Goertemiller ’17, who is a student intern with REP, said that Canaday was selected for upgrades because students felt that it needed energy reduction measures more than any other freshman dormitories.
“Most of the other dorms have actually managed to decrease their energy use over the past several years…but Canaday’s energy use has gone up about five percent,” he said.
The students of Green ’18 call the project a “weatherization,” which describes the facilities upgrades as an effort to reduce energy consumption in the building.
In order to assess how many bulbs were eligible for replacement, students from Green ’18 had to manually count and evaluate prospective lighting fixtures in Canaday.
According to Goertemiller, a University employee will change the bulbs on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The students received a grant from the Office of Physical Resources and Planning that covered all of the costs for the upgrades.
Green ’18 settled on the light bulb project after accounting for a number of factors, including cost, pragmatics, and environmental efficiency.
“The real winner here for us was the light bulbs just because there is so much energy that can be reduced, and then there are a lot of incentive programs right now to save money on buying the lightbulbs,” said Kelsey Grab, the residential coordinator for the FAS Green Program.
Rachel O. Gilchrist ’18, a freshman in Canaday and a member of Green ’18, emphasized the importance of student autonomy in deciding to move forward with the facilities upgrade.
She turned to the issue of shower timers to illustrate that point.
“We can’t add the ones that, you know, you get twenty minutes then it cuts the water off, because then people don’t get to make that choice anymore,” Gilchrist said. “We have to make changes that preserve people’s choice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police Department’s two-month-long investigation into the origins of a racially charged, emailed death threat sent primarily to female Asian American Harvard affiliates in early October has officially concluded, according to an email sent Friday by Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña.
German authorities will now take the helm in the ongoing investigation to apprehend and prosecute the sender of the threat, according to the email.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson that “the investigation is still open,” and would not comment on an open investigation per HUPD policy. He confirmed in an email that the investigation will now be led in German.
A person who self-identified as Huy Dinh had been contacting dozens of Harvard affiliates with requests for donations and Facebook followers for several months from the same email address linked to the death threat in October. The sender claimed to live in Hamburg, Germany, according to copies of some of the emails forwarded to The Crimson.
Catalano wrote in another email that “all indications are that there is one sender,” who, through multiple accounts, sent Harvard affiliates the death threat and additional followup emails, including an apology for the threat.
Dela Peña wrote that College administration is now collaborating with Harvard University Information and Technology to “develop additional outreach and educational efforts to enhance cybersecurity and online safety for our community.” Dela Peña referred to the initial threat as a “hate crime.”
In addition, as indicated in an email sent to the College community on Oct. 31, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has charged Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde and dela Peña with spearheading reform of the school’s bias reporting system, in an effort to ease the process of reporting bias, discrimination, and harassment on campus.
The Harvard College Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion is currently gathering information about peer institutions’ bias reporting systems. The College will organize focus groups to solicit feedback on bias reporting next semester, according to dela Peña.
Dela Peña said that she was unable to comment this weekend.

Nearly half of the Harvard Law School student body signed an open letter to President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder in the wake of recent grand jury decisions to not indict police officers for the deaths of two unarmed black men. The letter, released by the Harvard Black Law Students Association, calls for the use of body-worn cameras by police and the prosecution of police officers who “deprive black men and women of their constitutional right to life.”
The latest instance of student activism in response to the decisions, the HBLSA letter collected over a thousand signatories in 24 hours, including over 800 law school students, 39 student organizations, and 30 members of the faculty and staff. Of the faculty and staff, 9 professors, including Charles R. Nesson ’60 and Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., signed their names.
Last Tuesday, a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict a police officer who placed Eric Garner, accused of selling untaxed cigarettes, in a chokehold that led to his death. In a separate case, a St. Louis grand jury decided last month to not indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, after a physical altercation in August.
These decisions, according to the letter, illustrate a justice system that “remains willfully blind to the injustices and inequalities that persist along racial and economic lines in this country.”
The letter calls for Eric Holder and the Justice Department to bring civil rights charges against police departments and officers for “violat[ing] the constitutional rights of black men and women.”
Lastly, the letter, which was written in a week by members of HBLSA, invites Holder and Obama to Harvard Law School to continue the discussion and challenges the pair “to restore our faith in American Justice.”
The HBLSA launched a “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” campaign in August, following the death of Brown, and hosted a “Ferguson Reality Check” conference in October. At the end of November, the group also organized a luncheon to discuss the death of Brown and subsequent protests in Ferguson, MO.
While HBLSA has not directly organized the recent protests against the decisions, many members have participated in the rallies, and the organization supports the activism, according to McKenzie L. Morris, a third-year law student and the president of HBLSA.
“Although HBLSA led the creation of the letter, it’s not just us signing on,” Morris said. “It’s a ton of organizations who have supported us in every way.”

Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 were officially sworn into their offices as Undergraduate Council president and vice president at the organization’s general meeting Sunday evening, marking the transition from the tenure of Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15.
Before settling into a seat among the UC representatives and removing his trademark military jacket, Mayopoulos said that his time presiding over the student governing body was a yearlong journey from irreverent joke candidate to legitimate leader.
“I assumed I was walking into a room of people who hated me, and I may have been right. I may still be right. But it comes down to that you get out of this what you put in,” he said. “Sietse is more than a comrade: he’s become my best friend. It’s been an amazing experience.”
Goffard also praised his unlikely partner Mayopoulos and said that the year had been “a wild venture for both of us.” He said that he was initially nervous about joining the UC his freshman year, submitting and withdrawing his application twice.
“Although some of you may question if the UC is the right place for you, the ceiling of your influence is bounded only by the audacity of your dreams,” Goffard said to a standing ovation.
After taking the oath of office on an iPad displaying the UC constitution, Nasrollahzadeh reiterated her pitch for the UC to continue as a “transformative, active body.”
“The UC cannot be reduced to that of a one-dimensional body for funding,” she said. “Instead, I urge us to foster constructive disruption. Let us create a disruption that is productive and innovative.”
Goyal said that the 50 percent turnout rate for the UC elections signaled a continued student confidence in the organization and promised to dedicate himself to fulfilling his campaign goals.
“My late grandfather always said, ‘Winning an election is only people showing confidence in your ideas. It’s the work that you do after the election that really, really counts,'” he said. “That’s something that I’ve taken to heart.”
Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Yasmin Z. Sachee '18 were re-elected as UC Treasurer and Secretary, respectively.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, Mayopoulos, Goffard, and Leah C. Singer ’16, chair of the UC finance committee, said that the college administration has approved a grant of $21,000 for the organization’s pilot “bridging and belonging” grant. That grant—which will be matched with UC funds to constitute a total of $42,000—will be used to support collaborative events between student groups that would not typically interact and to host weekly community dinners for small, diverse groups of students at local restaurants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Escaping the brisk autumn air one sleepy Wednesday evening, a few dozen Harvard students file into the Theatre Room at the Faculty Club, enjoying the art-covered walls and complimentary hors d’oeuvres. At the front of the room, a projection screen sits, ready for use.
The gathering is not academic: the smartly dressed professionals standing at the head of the room, the glossy handouts plastered with buzzwords like “opportunity” and “dynamic” on every seat, and the semi-formal attire of the students all mark the event as a recruiting presentation.
Many employers recruit Harvard students on campus, but this presentation is different. The handouts carry the University’s seal and the company carries the University’s name: the Harvard Management Company.
Founded in 1974, HMC invests Harvard’s $36.4 billion endowment—the largest of any educational institution in the world—through a hybrid system, managing about 40 percent of total assets internally. In fiscal year 2014, the endowment distributed $1.5 billion, or 5.6 percent of its value, to support University operations, including financial aid and research.
Though HMC currently employs 23 University alumni among its more than 200 person staff, there has been a recent effort to have more Harvard students in its ranks, Emily Guadagnoli, a communications specialist for HMC, wrote in an email to The Crimson. HMC actively recruits Harvard undergraduate students on campus for full-time and internship positions, recently adding term-time and J-term options.
Through these renewed efforts, HMC has established itself as a unique alternative to more traditional finance internships, offering students an educational introduction to financial employment and an opportunity to further the University’s mission.
AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY
Though HMC participates in Harvard’s On Campus Interview program—through which a select few companies and financial institutions like Amazon, Facebook, and Goldman Sachs travel to campus to interview students—HMC is unique among this group for its inclusion of underclassmen students and what some describe as its educational focus through its smaller internship class.
As far as internships go, most financial institutions seek students in the summer after their junior year for a tryout for post-graduation employment, according to Deborah Carroll, associate director for employer relations and operations at the Office of Career Services.
“Employers use the junior internship essentially as a 10-week, mutual interview to see if someone is the right fit and hopefully give them a full time job,” she said. “Which does mean that for freshmen and sophomores it can be a lot harder to connect with an organization or to feel like you are eligible for an internship.”
Internships at HMC—according to Carroll, the only university endowment that participates in OCI, since the MIT Investment Management Company stopped coming to campus a couple of years ago—are less structured, giving students the opportunity to work at a high-level financial institution after their freshman or sophomore year with what interns said was competitive compensation.
Jiayi Peng ’17, one of the four Harvard undergraduate interns at HMC this past summer, noted this rare opportunity at HMC amidst a relative lack of finance internship options after freshman year.
“I was really, really lucky to get this internship,” she said.
While some students view an internship at HMC as a unique way to get exposure to finance early on in college, others, like Henry H. Wang ’15, were drawn to HMC because of a class taught by Stephen Blyth, HMC’s rising CEO and the current managing director and head of public markets.
In the class, Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance,” Blyth framed the financial concepts from the course in the context of HMC, bringing in his colleagues to talk to the class about their work.
Wang said that the financial education he received in Blyth’s class continued throughout his internship at HMC. Because the internship program at HMC is relatively small and includes underclassmen, interns said that their work schedule was less structured, allowing for close interaction with senior employees and more opportunities to learn.
Rebecca Y. Hu ’16, a Crimson business editor and an intern at HMC last summer, described the internship as “transparent,” saying she had easy access to her supervisors.
“The internship not necessarily treated us just as employees, but I think also as students,” she said. “There was this unspoken educational aspect to the internship that I really appreciated.”
Hu said that she feels that the open and collaborative nature of the office contributed to the educational experience.
“It was definitely not as intense as internships that my friends pursued over the summer at banks, for example,” she said.
A UNIVERSITY ENDOWMENT
In addition to these unique methods of engaging students, both interns and full-time employees said that the mission of HMC and its connection to Harvard were important parts of why they choose to work there. With endowment returns funding everything from scientific research to financial aid, employees say their work carries a special personal gravity.
Wang said that he valued the opportunity to contribute to the endowment’s mission, given his personal experience as a Harvard student.
“Myself being someone who benefits from [financial aid], being able to work in an environment where I know that the end result of my work ends up going to students like me...was definitely a rewarding experience,” he said.
Wang said he noticed that there was a sense of “people wanting to do good things.”
“And you don’t see that at most financial institutions,” he said.
Current full-time employees echoed the importance of HMC’s mission in their work.
Richard L. Hall ’90, who attended Harvard on a scholarship from the Navy and is now the head of private equity at HMC, said that helping to offer the next generation of students the opportunity to attend Harvard played an important role in his decision to join the company in April.
“I know that the endowment provides a lot of the resources needed to give financial aid and scholarships. To me that’s important,”  Hall said. “It’s personally motivating.”
He said that this social value is not something he saw in his work in the private sector. Hall worked in investment banking before serving as the managing director and head of private equity for the Teaching Retirement System of Texas, the pension fund for public school employees in Texas before he came to HMC.
“Investment banking can be very a good and rewarding career, but I didn’t find the same kind of level of psychological gratification,” Hall said. “There definitely wasn’t a feeling that I was serving something or somebody that made an impact in the world.”
Blyth also stressed this idea of impact, writing in an emailed statement: “Everyone who works here understands the impact the endowment returns have on the University’s operations. That’s a unique and powerful motivating factor that permeates the whole company.”
And with an endowment so big—a one percent change in annual returns represents $364 million—HMC is not at a loss for impact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An estimated 600 protesters streamed through Harvard Square Friday evening around 6 p.m. en route from Tufts University to MIT in what appeared to be the largest gathering yet in Cambridge in response to two recent decisions by grand juries not to indict white police officers who killed unarmed black men.
The events Friday followed a week of national and campus-wide protests regarding the two separate cases of Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner of Staten Island, N. Y., the unarmed black men who died during police altercations. Harvard affiliates also staged a “die-in” Dec. 7 on the steps of Memorial Church to protest “state-sanctioned lethal force against unarmed citizens.”
After passing through Davis Square Friday, the marching protesters rallied in front of the Harvard Coop before continuing down JFK Street and turning east on Mt. Auburn Avenue toward MIT, temporarily diverting traffic. The protest attracted local police departments, including those of Somerville and Cambridge, and at least four helicopters circling overhead. The police also temporarily shut down the main Harvard Square MBTA entrance.
The protesters were stopped by a police line at Mass. Ave. Bridge on the Cambridge side near MIT, according to State Police spokesman David Procopio, as reported in the Boston Globe.
Harvard students who participated in the march said they felt compelled to raise awareness from their vantage point as University members.
“The more people who join, the more attention it gets and the more people are aware of the problem,” said Yasmin A. Rawlins ’15, who joined the march at Harvard Square. “Even adding one voice to the chorus of voices helps. The more voices there are, the louder it gets.”
Jennifer L. Ruiz ’16 said she marched because she thought that issue warranted more attention from Harvard.
“I feel like Harvard's campus has been very oblivious to what's been going on in America, and I feel like this march did not disrupt, but it definitely bought people’s awareness, coming through these universities,” Ruiz said.
Earlier Friday afternoon around 3:30 p.m., Harvard affiliates wore hospital masks that read, “We can’t breathe” in front of the John Harvard statue at University Hall. They chanted the phrase 11 times to signify Garner’s repeated use of the phrase while being choked by a police officer intending to arrest him on an illegal sale of cigarettes charge. The protesters also held a 4.5 minute die-in to represent the 4.5 hours Brown’s body lay in the street before being taken to the morgue.
The four freshmen who planned the event spent the hours prior passing out hospital masks they obtained from Harvard University Health Services.
“It’s everybody’s issue at the end of the day,” said Robert Rush ’18, one of the protest’s organizers, to the crowd of about 50 gathered on the chilly December afternoon. “It’s a larger issue than just police brutality. It’s a whole issue with the treatment of black people over the course of American history. It’s a greater issue than just Ferguson. It’s a greater issue than just New York City.”
Samuel H. Koppelman ’18, another protest organizer who is currently comping The Crimson, addressed the crowd after Rush.
“If one of us can’t breathe, none of us should be able to breathe,” Koppelman said. “While I can breathe, and while almost all white Americans can breathe in a way that's different than those of color in America, it’s a time like this when everything is so palpable and omnipresent that we need to come together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the victors belong the spoils.
In the aftermath of a last-minute win over Yale in the 131st playing of the Game, several Crimson players earned more than the emotional satisfaction of a thrilling finish—they also racked up personal honors.
As usual, senior defensive end Zach Hodges led the pack. For the second season in a row, he was named a finalist for Ivy League Football Player of the Year. Hodges, who has the most sacks in Harvard history, won the prize in 2013. If he duplicates the feat, he will be the first Ancient Eight player to receive the title two times in a row since Crimson wide receiver Carl Morris in 2001 and 2002.
The Gridiron Club of Greater Boston went a step further in naming Hodges the recipient of the George “Bulger” Lowe Award. Nicknamed “New England’s Heisman Trophy,” the prize goes to the top defensive player in the region.
Hodges’s continued to rack up prizes on a national scale. Earlier this week, he accepted an invitation to play in the East-West Shrine Game, which will take place at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The next day, the team announced that Hodges had also earned a spot on the College Sports Madness All-America team.
On the season, the defensive back topped the Ivy League with 8.5 sacks and placed third with 10 tackles for a loss. His largest play of the year came in the dying seconds of the matchup against the Bulldogs, when Hodges dragged down Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts. Harvard intercepted the ball on the next play.
Predictably, Hodges was a unanimous All-Ivy first team selection. Seventeen teammates joined him on one of the all-conference squads. Junior defensive back Sean Ahern, senior offensive lineman Nick Easton, senior tight end Tyler Hamblin, senior defensive back Norman Hayes, senior defensive tackle Obum Obukwelu, senior linebacker Connor Sheehan, junior running back Paul Stanton, Jr., and junior offensive lineman Cole Toner all got the first-team nod.
Although junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer made the second team, he earned Ancient Eight co-Offensive Player of the Week after racking up 264 total yards and two touchdowns against Yale. In addition, he garnered a New England Football Writers’ Association Gold Helmet. Sheehan won Defensive Player of the Week thanks to a performance that included a 90-yard pick-six at the end of the third quarter.
Players were not the only Harvard affiliates to receive personal prizes. After his third undefeated season with the Crimson, Harvard head coach Tim Murphy was tapped as the inaugural Ivy League Coach of the Year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After surviving its first road test of the year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (6-1) returns to the cozy confines of Lavietes Pavilion to take on Boston University (7:00 p.m., Ivy League Digital Network) Monday night in the squad's last game before the end of finals period. Below, The Back Page takes a look at three things to keep your eye on as Harvard winds down its first half of nonconference play.
Boston Domination: Harvard has taken down two of the three local opponents it has played this year, with the one loss a one-point defeat to Holy Cross at TD Garden. It looks to have little problem with the Terriers, which come in spotting a 2-5 record and are barely ranked inside KenPom’s top 250 teams. BU has been outscored by more than five points per game and allows opponents to shoot nearly 50 percent from the field. Harvard’s defense, which has held six of its seven opponents to under 65 points, will provide a stiff test for a Terrier offense that shoots just 41 percent from the floor.
Early Struggles: Against Vermont, the Crimson struggled on offense from the get-go, with perhaps nobody epitomizing these struggles better than co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi. The forward made just two of his 12 shots, including missing a dunk at the end of regulation that would have ended the game. Moundou-Missi is averaging 9.1 points a game this year and has only two games in double digits. He is shooting 64 percent from the line and has not had the same effectiveness inside as he has in previous years. Of all the players that suffer from the Crimson’s lack of spacing, Moundou-Missi may have it the toughest. The team’s lack of long-range shooting forces him to float inside the three-point line and use his jumper to create space, taking him away from what he does best.
Miller Time: Sophomore Corbin Miller had his best game of the season against Vermont, knocking down a crucial three-pointer to tie the game at 50 at the end of the first overtime and putting in 14 points for the game. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has repeatedly called him the best shooter on the team and Miller’s ability to shoot the three (he is at 41 percent for the year) is crucial to the Crimson’s spacing. The only other above-average shooter on the roster who gets significant minutes is junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, whose ball-dominant role takes away from his ability to space the floor. As Harvard looks to boost its anemic offense, it will most likely turn to Miller to provide the necessary spacing.

Good morning, Harvard! Just a friendly reminder that today is Monday, in case days are becoming irrelevant to you since it’s reading period and the only way you keep track of time is “x more days I can spend not studying for my first final.” Here are some things that are socially acceptable to do during reading period so you should take complete advantage of:
1) Spending more than half your day sleeping: Why would you not maximize your time in bed (aka the best place in the world)?
2) Never leaving your house: You can eat, sleep, socialize, and study (questionable) in your house, so no need to brave the unforgiving winter weather and change out of your pajamas ever.
3) Wasting an inordinate amount of time on the Internet: What’s cooler, studying for your final or reading weird Wikipedia pages about things that have no relevance to your life whatsoever?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It’s really cold again today, cloudy and 35 degrees, so be sure to bundle up for that dreaded walk to Lamont! There’s also a 20% chance of rain so there’s really no reason to be happy about ever going out.

IN THE NEWS
1) Open Letter to Obama Calls for Better Justice System: "Nearly half of the Harvard Law School student body signed an open letter to President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder in the wake of recent grand jury decisions to not indict police officers for the deaths of two unarmed black men. The letter, released by the Harvard Black Law Students Association, calls for the use of body-worn cameras by police and the prosecution of police officers who 'deprive black men and women of their constitutional right to life.'"
2) Nasrollahzadeh, Goyal Assume UC Leadership: "Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 were officially sworn into their offices as Undergraduate Council president and vice president at the organization’s general meeting Sunday evening, marking the transition from the tenure of Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15."
3) Walton To Protesters: 'What Will You Do?' To Fight Racial Inequality: "Dozens of students and affiliates laid on the cold ground outside of Memorial Church Sunday morning as part of a die-in protest, inspired by the decisions not to charge two white police officers whose actions led to the deaths of black, unarmed men this summer. Attendants of the usual 11:00 a.m. Sunday church service stepped slowly through the still bodies, and many stopped to take pictures or join in the demonstration."
ON SPORTS
1) Men's Hockey Takes Share of Conference Lead with Win at Quinnipiac: "The Harvard men’s ice hockey team enters the December break with a lead to defend."
2) Indoor Track and Field Starts Season: "Saturday morning served as the calm before the storm for Harvard’s track and field program. In their first meet of the season, the men’s and women’s teams kicked off their 2014-2015 indoor campaigns at the Boston University Opener."
3) Women's Basketball Falls to Maine: "Heading into a Sunday matchup with Maine, the Harvard women’s basketball team (4-4) was a gambler’s delight. In the first seven games of the season, the Crimson had followed a script of predictable unpredictability, following every win with a loss and vice versa."
