Boston is a city of numerous cultural institutions—one can easily attend school here for four years without exploring all the opportunities available. One such often-missed opportunity is the Boston Athenæum, set back from sidewalk at its 10 ½ Beacon Street location. In a city with one of the most reputable public libraries in the country, it is understandable why many Bostonians are only vaguely aware of this 206-year-old private library. David B. Dearinger, Susan Morse Hilles curator of paintings and sculpture and director of exhibitions at the Athenæum, is trying to change this state of affairs with the exhibition “Collecting for the Boston Athenæum in the 21st Century: Paintings and Sculpture.”
Dearinger, who has been at the Athenæum for nearly 10 years, has slowly been building the library’s collection of fine art. The fruits of that effort are now on display at the new exhibition, which runs through February 15. This exhibition, which features works created from 1820 to the current day, showcases the acquisitions made in the past 10 years and illustrates the vibrancy of the institution, Dearinger feels. “Many people are not aware that the Athenæum still collects anything,” he says. “I have people asking all the time, ‘Do you still collect?’... And that’s one reason I really put this together. Yes, we collect.”
  The exhibition is a powerful testament to that fact. Over 50 pieces, grouped by type of subject, are on display. Upon entering the exhibition, viewers will naturally gravitate toward the portraiture section, which comprises 15 exemplary pieces from various points in the span of the 19th century. While some stand out largely for their historical value—a Thomas Ball bust of Daniel Webster, an anonymous plaster relief of John Quincy Adams—others captivate by merit of their execution. Outstanding in this category is William McGregor Paxton’s “Elizabeth Vaughan Okie,” painted around 1895. The subject, Paxton’s future wife, is bathed in a soft radiance in which viewers will instantly recognize the influence of the Impressionists. The delicacy of execution is especially notable in the treatment of the subject’s luminous pink dress and dark hair; more subtly engaging is the deeply thoughtful expression on her face. It is little wonder that this painting is the image used by the Athenæum to advertise the exhibition.
  Although “Elizabeth” is the most memorable piece on display, Dearinger has a particular affection for a more recent piece in the genre painting section: “Shopping for Furs (Trying on Furs),” painted by Polly Thayer around 1943. “[It is] of a woman who has been shopping for too long,” Dearinger says. “She has become a study of, ‘I’ve had it, that’s it, I can’t go on.’ She’s very popular. People love her, as I knew they would.” The subject exudes exhaustion, collapsed into a heap on a sagging chair next to the titular furs, a grimly sympathetic character in the face of the looming holiday season.
  In addition to seeing the Athenæum’s art collection, visitors can also learn about the extensive book collection and research services offered by the Athenæum to its members. Besides these concrete resources, however, Dearinger feels there is an indefinable air of hominess to the library. “It’s also the atmosphere of the place, and the intimacy of it,” Dearinger says. “[It is] Intimate without being stodgy, I think, or claustrophobic.” Looking forward to the future of the Athenæum, Dearinger hopes that this exhibition will draw a new generation into that atmosphere and intimacy at the Boston institution.

When Best Coast crashed the indie rock scene in 2010, lead vocalist Bethany Cosentino revealed that she suffers from anxiety. From a casual listen through their debut “Crazy for You,” it’s hard to believe her, but a more thorough look at her discography puts her career into perspective. Before Best Coast, Cosentino was one half of Pocahaunted, a psychedelic soft-drone band whose sound revolved around washy, lo-fidelity guitars backing wordless vocalizations. Cosentino initially began writing the music that would become Best Coast’s debut album, “Crazy for You,” as a coping mechanism after dropping out of school and returning to her hometown of Los Angeles. So when you put Best Coast’s latest record, a “mini-album” of seven songs titled “Fade Away,” into context, it becomes the latest in a series of musical releases designed to fight Cosentino’s demons by appealing to her strong sense of home.
“Fade Away” is first and foremost a continuation of Best Coast’s surf-pop groove, heavily featuring catchy guitar melodies, clapping rhythms on the snare drum, and lyrics siphoned out of a middle school diary. Of course, lyrical proficiency was never the forte of a band whose critically acclaimed debut album opens its title track with the offensively simple rhyme scheme “You drive me crazy, but I love you / You make me lazy, but I love you.” Instead, the draw of “Crazy For You” was the amazing simplicity of the two-chord, surf’s-up rock—this was an album that seemed to be written specifically for the band’s “best coast, west coast” adage.
 
The biggest misstep of “Fade Away” is moving away from Best Coast’s formula for success. This seems to be a conscientious decision on the part of Cosentino and multi-instrumentalist Bobb Bruno—2012’s “The Only Place” already showed signs of creative wandering in its meticulous production and smattering of country influences. But the success of “Crazy for You” was thanks to the very same characteristics that Best Coast try to leave behind in “Fade Away”: simple song structures and soaked-in-reverb vocals, all over a fuzzy backdrop of pop guitar. “Fade Away,” in contrast, opens with a sound that immediately feels misplaced. The percussion and guitars on “This Lonely Morning” sound clean, even sterile, and Cosentino’s voice shines through like that of a prima donna rather than that of a rock star.
 
But while their production gets tighter and cleaner, Best Coast frustratingly continue to diffuse their sound on successive albums. Tracks like the closer, “I Don’t Know How,” are quite obviously infused with country influences, which makes for a strange amalgam that doesn’t sit comfortably in either genre. “Who Have I Become” opens aggressively with a pop-punk guitar riff and never seems to choose between pop-punk and surf-pop for its entire five minutes. “This Lonely Morning” and “I Wanna Know,” the first two tracks on the album, are the only parts of the record compositionally comparable to Best Coast’s earlier, sun-kissed sound.
 
Although creative exploration is typically a sign of a healthily maturing discography, Best Coast’s experimentation is detrimental. It seems that the band’s niche is so specific that their carefree simplicity quickly becomes their Achilles’ heel when they leave their comfort zone. Where “Crazy for You” was cheerful and buoyant, “Fade Away” just feels mindless and simplistic. The four-and-a-half-minute ballad “Baby I’m Crying” is the album’s biggest pitfall, opening with a downtempo waltz and an incredibly mundane melody outlined by Cosentino’s tiresome drawl, “My eyes aren’t what you say they are / My hands, they don’t reach that far.” Repetitive, simple melodic lines work well when complemented by the uptempo whir of guitars and carefree lyricism, but quickly turn immature when Cosentino sings about identity crises, vulnerability, and the loss of trust in someone she loves.
 
Indeed, “Crazy for You” was, in a way, too good to be true—it’s hard to believe that Cosentino’s lowest lows manifested themselves in the line “Nothing makes me happy, not even TV or a bunch of weed.” Perhaps secretly, much of the true appeal of the album was thanks to Cosentino’s struggles with anxiety and her subsequent overcompensation by swamping the album in sunshine and salt. Paradoxically, however, as Best Coast move away from this and turn towards cleaner production and more direct address of their subject matter, the resulting tracks sound less honest and relatable. Best Coast’s sound works so extraordinarily well in one particular niche that they feel out of place, almost uncomfortable, outside of it—and the worst thing you could do to surf pop is to make it sound uncomfortable.

Poliça’s “Shulamith” is all about layers. They’re everywhere in the record—synths hover over bass lines, while subtle tones from other synths hum in the background. Singer Channy Leaneagh’s vocals wander and meld with these multifaceted sounds, often granting the synth a prominent role while the lyrics border on indecipherable. Leaneagh’s vocals themselves are often obscured under strange mixtures of autotune, distortion and reverb. This veiled soundscape is often difficult to traverse, but with persistence a core of neurotic tragedy can be found. Those very layers create a suffocating feel that underscores the album’s poignant story. With “Shulamith,” Poliça have happened upon a compelling, immediate tone.
 
“Shulamith” flirts with themes that could pull it under the familiar classification of being a breakup album, but it belongs to the rare class of albums that have actually managed to capture the full complexity of said breakup and transcend it. It doesn’t allow itself to get caught up in the details, instead appealing to more universal emotional themes. “Shulamith” succeeds in painting a vivid, complicated picture of romantic desolation.
 
The album’s complex themes are reflected in its instrumentation and sonic landscape. These combine to create a uniquely dark sound, driven by the band’s two drummers. Poliça are commonly categorized as synthpop, but there is nothing poppy about this album.
 
“Shulamith” begins with a surprising amount of energy, considering the album’s bleak themes: “Chain My Name,” the album’s opener, is powered forward by driving drums, a twanging bass, and harsh, arpeggiated synthesizer. The nagging doubts that persist throughout the album are present even here, though, and in a significant way. “So are we made just to fight / All our lives?” Leaneagh’s fuzzy vocals ask at the outset. While the song is characterized by a driving beat, there is little real strength here. Instead, “Chain My Name” is dripping with nervous energy. “Chain my name beside you,” Leaneagh begs of her lover. The song mixes an awareness of impending collapse with a desperate plea for stability. It’s a captivating start to an album that will unflinchingly portray an emotional catastrophe. 
 
It isn’t all panic, though; the record’s second song, “Smug,” trades the previous track’s neurotic angst for a deep, confused resentment. “No bother I’m through with you / It’s really quite confusing / You’re pushing me away and then you’re pulling,” Leaneagh croons. The song’s mood is quiet and confessional. Leaneagh’s vocals barely float on top of undulating synthesizers and occasionally have to struggle to the top of the mix. “You wear smug so very well / If you were in love with me I could never tell,” Leaneagh sings in the song’s chorus. “Smug,” in conjunction with “Chain My Name,” maps out the desolate emotional landscape that permeates the rest of the album.
 
The tragedy of “Shulamith” is unrelenting. The album avoids sentimentality altogether, replacing it with emotional vulnerability to one’s ex-lover. The ubiquitous bleakness of “Shulamith” is saved from being tiring through the compelling sense of self that persists throughout the work. Even though the album is littered with broken emotions, the consciousness behind the album is still strong and self-aware. The closest “Shulamith” comes to an anthem is “Torre” (and even that is only very remotely anthemic). “Who is the starlit, I am / Who is the harlot, I am / Who is the diamond, I am / Who is the lion, I am,” Leaneagh belts out during the chorus. These lyrics don’t shy away from flaws or strength. Instead, Poliça do something elegant and simple, juxtaposing strength and weakness in a jarringly direct manner.
 
The immaculate rendering of loss in “Shulamith” isn’t flawlessly successful in its execution—the album’s masked vocals, while stylistically fitting, often detract from the experience in their opacity. In describing a pain so immediate and gut-wrenching, the distant vocals are often more frustrating than intriguing.
 
It’s hard to fault an album for a slight deficiency in accessibility, though. Even considering the frustratingly indecipherable moments of Leaneagh’s performance, “Shulamith” reaches its goal with devastating efficacy. The album illustrates pain in a genuine, complicated, tortured way. “Shulamith” will reward those patient enough with a stunning and desolately rendered emotional landscape.

It isn’t every day in the world of theater that juice boxes get thrown around as metaphors for life. Productions centering around the suicides of school-aged children don’t usually incite lighthearted laughter from audiences. Plays rarely aspire to the realm of unadulterated metatheatre that consists of adult actors portraying elementary school children portraying themselves in another play. Condensing all of these unconventionalities into one show certainly makes “The 4th Graders Present an Unnamed Love-Suicide,” which played at Zero Church Street Theater through Saturday, a theatrical eccentric. Such was the challenge that director Marcus Stern, the actors, and the production team of the ART/ MXAT Institute for Advanced Theater Training undertook in staging “4th Graders”: to develop the show in a way that did justice to the plurality of themes and staging demands.
Written by Sean Graney, a Radcliffe fellow and founding director of The Hypocrites Theater Company in Chicago, “4th Graders” takes its form as a suicide note translated into a theatrical production. It centers around a group of fourth graders presenting a play written by their classmate Johnny before he committed suicide. Their performance represents the chain of events that caused Johnny to kill himself, with many of the fourth graders characters portraying themselves in Johnny’s play.
Contrary to the morbidity of its title, “4th Graders” has more than its fair share of comedic moments. Purposeful malapropisms and comic, childish dialogue abound and flow throughout the play, taking the edge off of its more somber subject matter. It’s a very striking juxtaposition at times that requires both subtlety in acting and purpose in direction. It’s also one of the reasons Stern selected this play to be performed by his second-year graduate students.
“[‘4th Graders’] reflects a general aesthetic I have which is a combination of pushed realism, a little bit of surrealism, and some goofier sillier humor,” Stern says. “I tend to be drawn to things that are both funny, silly, and heartbreaking simultaneously.” The plurality of the play never felt unnatural or contrived, as evidenced by the play’s quick transition from heartwarming moments of childish playfulness to the suicide of the closing scene.
Stern gives all the praise on this front to the playwright. “The balance of charm and heartbreak is sculpted into the text in such a strong and smart way,” Stern says. “It’s a wonderful combination of great sophistication and seemingly surface simplicity.”
The unique nature of “4th Graders” called for many important staging and production decisions. Stern and the ART team ultimately decided on an intimate, black box-esque setting that placed the audience close to the action of the play. Scenic director Madie Hays crafted a bare and minimalist school hallway saturated with bright colors that established the play’s feeling of youthfulness. Meanwhile, transient dream-like sequences of soft lights and ethereal live vocal music by singer Marissa Stewart established Stern’s vision of fleeting surrealism. Though the audience was so close to the production, one of the major challenges of the process was deciding just how much the characters were to directly engage them. In this aspect, Stern says, having the playwright involved in the process was an invaluable asset. Stern says that Graney suggested a more presentational feel to communicate the self-conscious nature of 10-year-olds.
The character of Johnny (Dereks Thomas), despite being a grown man pretending to be a child, was so uncannily and inexplicably familiar that when he complained of being let down by the quality of the ever-present juice box from which he’s sipping, it is evident that he’s bemoaning the difficulties of something more sophisticated. This inexplicable connection to such a purposefully awkward character—after all, it is an adult portraying a nine-year-old—is not easily established. But Stern and his production team accepted this challenge; through a genuine reproduction of what was supposed to be a play written by children, they managed to convey a deep message while maintaining the emotion of confused and innocent children.
“I want the takeaway to be that we are all struggling…. Ideally we will learn to recognize when we’re cruel so we can continue to work on ourselves so that we are kinder both to ourselves and to others,” Stern says. It’s an ambitious goal, but one well within the production’s reach. “4th Graders” doubtlessly incited a plethora of different reactions to the content of the show, but one thing is for sure—we will never think of juice boxes the way same again.

When Universal Pictures recently announced that British actor Charlie Hunnam had dropped out of the highly anticipated film adaptation of E.L. James’s erotic novel “Fifty Shades of Grey,” it did so by stating that his “immersive TV schedule [was] not allowing him time to adequately prepare for the role of Christian Grey.”
This appeared to be Hunnam’s thinly veiled cop-out from playing the sadistic billionaire with a penchant for leather and handcuffs. After all, there are TV actors who can play complex TV characters while preparing for a major film role (Bryan Cranston comes to mind); if Hunnam wanted to play Grey, he probably would have found a way to make it happen. So why did he bow out of the project? Here are our guesses for why he really dumped the film:
 
1. “Show me how you pleasure yourself.” Hunnam was presumably not too keen on saying this line to his co-star Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele. Nor would he want to be caught on camera saying, “I’m going to take you from behind, Anastasia.”
 
2. Oh, and he would have had to spank Johnson on film. Hunnam must have known that after that scene, he would have trouble getting a serious acting job.
 
3. The backlash from fans of the novels may have scared Hunnam from attempting to portray the mysterious Christian Grey.
 
4. Maybe Hunnam thought the movie would focus too gratuitously on his body. He’s done nude scenes for “Sons of Anarchy,” but a show about a biker gang apparently necessitates nudity more than the erotic novel adaptation he signed on for.
 
5. Hunnam might have been scared of becoming the next Robert Pattinson: stuck in a film franchise that he resented and constantly bombarded by the franchise’s rabid fans. Given that James’s main readership comprises middle-aged women, Hunnam probably wasn’t looking forward to becoming the next soccer mom-heartthrob.

“No one will ever love you more than you love your pain,” Madame Gaëlle, the main protagonist in Edwidge Danticat’s “Claire of the Sea Light,” is told after her daughter’s death. Narrated in a precise yet lyrical prose, this book is a powerful work that confronts the ugly face of life. While focusing mostly on life and death, this book explores several other universal themes as well, such as social and gender inequality, economic injustice, and political corruption. Although overwhelming at times because of so many themes and interwoven stories, the book manages to resonate hauntingly through its unsparing message—that life does go on, but not without its scars.
Set in Ville Rose, a fictional town in Haiti where streets are called épines, or thorns, the novel begins at an intersection: on the little girl Claire’s seventh birthday, her poor fisherman father, Nozias, must decide if he will give her away to Gaëlle, a wealthy fabric vendor who can afford to raise a child. But after discovering Nozias’ plan, Claire runs away from home. Danticat uses this crisis as a platform to delve into other characters and their tangential relationships. We soon find out that Gaëlle has had her fair share of misfortunes as well. She lost her husband to a gang shooting on the day that her own daughter was born. She bribes corrupt police officers to exact her revenge, only for it to be to on an innocent person. Later, she becomes romantically involved with Max Senior, whose son is the actual culprit. Meanwhile, Max Junior recently discovered that he had a son, born after he raped his family’s servant Flore. Flore vents out her resentment at a local radio station, which is run by Max Senior’s estranged lover. The plot, though it offers room for multiple themes, is long-winded and circuitous.
But Danticat’s subtle interweaving of the plot in a cyclical pattern, which mirrors the circle of life about which she is writing, both compensates for the plot’s tangles and frequent changes in perspective and emphasizes the book’s message of renewal after injuries of the past. Claire’s mother dies while giving birth to Claire. Madame Gaëlle’s husband is murdered on the day that Madame Gaëlle gives birth to their daughter. Max Junior’s son is conceived on the day that his friend, Bernard, is murdered. It is not coincidental that the mayor of the town also maintains a funeral business. The book carefully threads this pattern of loss and redemption in two ways: an individual cycle for a character in each of the eight chapters and a broader one for the town of Ville Rose in two sections, the first of which addresses death and the latter renewal. As the characters are haunted by the ghosts of the past even as they move on, the overall effect is a collage that emphasizes the cyclical nature of life. Claire returns back into the plot and to her home at the very end of the book, not knowing what will happen to her—a poignant end that befits this book.
In addition to the intricate structure, Danticat’s expressive yet objective prose elevates this book’s message from a mere cliché to a touching lesson. As she moves through the story, her voice is precise and journalistic: “Louise George, hostess of the radio program Di Mwen, had been coughing up blood during her periods ever since she began menstruating at age thirteen.” No matter the context, Danticat maintains a sense of distance. Yet this removal also gives power to the passages that depict pain: “Even though he visited the gravesite regularly, Nozias always felt the same rush of pain, almost like being punched in the heart, each time he was there.” The economy of prose imparts a sense of blunt truth to her message that the readers are forced to confront.
As much as “Claire of the Sea Light” is a significant work, however, Danticat injects too many other themes for her cyclical world to be as profound as it could be. Hovering around Ville Rose is the disparity between the affluent and the poor, many of whom belong to gangs, or “chimeras.” Madame Gaëlle’s troubles involve political and police corruption, while Max Junior and Senior’s misdeeds show clear misogyny. These themes, which could merit a book of their own, were only tangentially touched upon. At times, it feels as if Danticat arranged the characters to fit the themes, as opposed to letting the characters flesh out the themes themselves.
Despite its shortcomings, “Claire of the Sea Light” is a moving novel that grimly reflects how people, while resilient, also come with remnants of pain from the past. Even if the pain seems to be too much at times, life still goes on: “Her losses had not made her stronger; they had made her weak…. She didn’t want to continue being weak, but she didn’t want to die either. She was too eager to see what would come next…. She was both hungry for life and terrified of it.”

I can’t decide what to write about.
That’s hardly a good start to a column, but putting seven words on paper bemoaning my inability to put words on paper beats putting no words at all.
I have a few ideas, of course. The ones that don’t taste stale, though, taste a little fishy—as if I could start down the path of writing one and, five stunted paragraphs later, realize that my argument is the product of many exams and few hours of sleep, and that I could have picked a different topic and written an at least slightly coherent piece, but it would be too late. And then where will I be?
My inability to commit brings to mind a quote from a fittingly cheery source for midterm season: Sylvia Plath. “I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree,” writes Plath, “starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest.”
I’m slightly concerned to find myself empathizing with a woman who stuck her head in an oven. And yet the crippling uncertainty Plath expresses has been haunting me of late—not only when it comes to something as trivial as picking a column topic. For one, my sources tell me I cannot enroll only in Gen Ed courses for the remainder of my college career. They tell me it’s time to concentrate.
Settling on a concentration scares me for reasons closely aligned with Plath’s. If I opt to study English, will I forsake the chance to truly understand the ideals underpinning our democracy? And if I go the route of government, will I ever manage to get through Ulysses? Sure, I can still take classes in one department even if the name of another will grace my diploma, but devoting myself to one discipline will inevitably decrease the amount I learn about any other.
That all seems like small potatoes, though, when I look three years ahead toward the looming, unknown future that awaits me in the Real World. Will I doom myself to a life of Top Ramen and breadcrumbs as I struggle to support myself by writing personal essays (much like these) that no one has any interest in reading, much less publishing, until I ultimately surrender and go to law school to secure my future? The fact that I’m having trouble breaking or tightening up the preceding sentence doesn’t bode well. If I’m fated to fail in literary endeavors, I might as well start studying for the LSAT now.
Thumbing through a bookshelf back home this summer, I once happened upon an old edition of a publication that did little to set me at ease: “What Color Is Your Parachute?: A Practical Manual for Job-Hunters and Career Changers.” I don’t even know where to find my parachute, much less its color. Send me skydiving and I’ll flail wildly in the air until I hit the ground. I can’t decide what to do with a column, and I can’t decide what to do with college. How on earth will I ever decide what to do with my life?
More than slightly concerned now, I’ve resolved to take a tip from Sylvia Plath. Her parable, not so shockingly, does not have a happy ending. “[A]s I sat there, unable to decide,” Plath describes, “the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” I hear Plath’s message loud and clear: I should buck up and pick a gosh darn fig already.
Sitting around worrying about what to study won’t get me anywhere—studying something will. Rather than agonizing over our choices, we should go ahead and make them. We should listen to our guts, perhaps with a light helping of logic on the side, and take things as they come. That’s not to say we’ll never choose wrong, but rather to suggest that we have people around to help us when we do. Safety nets, whether our friends or family or Harvard itself, stand ready to catch us when our multicolored parachutes malfunction. Plus, there’s the huge chance that we choose right and that we’re happy for it.
After all, I did just write a column.

To the editors:
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has asked what qualities are necessary and desirable in the next Dean of Harvard College. I would encourage him to relax the constraint that the Dean be a tenured faculty member.  For most of the modern era, the longest-serving and most effective deans were not tenured faculty: John U. Monro, Fred L. Glimp, Charles P. Whitlock, John B. Fox, Jr., L. Fred Jewett.  When Harry R. Lewis ’68 was made dean in 1995, he was only the second tenured professor since 1947 to hold the post.
The Dean of Harvard College is a pastoral job: She cares for students as holistic beings and creates an environment for undergraduates to flourish.  This pastoral temperament and orientation is difficult to find anywhere—but especially among Harvard-caliber tenured faculty, who have keenly (and often single-mindedly) spent their careers pursuing their academic interests.  They simply have not had a lot of practice or experience taking care of undergrads as whole people.
It's crucial that the Dean of the College have the utmost respect for and deference to the faculty; she should work hard to earn their trust and respect and support, which she will need to be successful in her job.  But she should not necessarily be a tenured (or tenure-track) professor.  That requirement bears little relation to the day-to-day responsibilities of this job.

To Whom It May Concern:
It is with great enthusiasm that I am applying for whatever position you are willing to give me. The skills that I have learned in college are vaguely applicable to the job you posted on my university’s career page. Please employ me.
Your job posting, along with several others, sounds somewhat promising considering that I have been conditioned to want nothing short of changing the world. It says in the position description that you appreciate the “rolled up sleeves” approach. Although I am confused as to whether this is a dress code or a mentality, I will say that I can do either. It’s not a good look for me, but the same goes for pre-med, pre-law, and any of the other “pre-” designations. I wish we could be frank with each other: I could tell you that I am smart, and you could ignore a low GPA (just part of attaining higher education today, am I right?). But in the end, we both know that isn’t good look for you, so it looks like we’ll both need to make some sacrifices.
Having attended a premier academic institution, it was difficult to narrow down my most positive attributes to a single page, but I have attempted to do so in merely two paragraphs. Please let me know if any of the following are applicable to your company because, if not, I will most definitely have acquired the necessary skills before the interview.  The Office of Career Services compares finding a job to playing a contact sport. While I have never actually played a contact sport, it sounds like it involves being knocked down in some capacity, and I am great at falling. Sometimes, when working in a group setting, I tell stories that make people laugh. When I play “Apples to Apples,” I usually win, which is harder than you might imagine at the collegiate level of play. Furthermore, I almost never lose at beer pong, except for when I play against people who are better than I am.
In between writing my purely theoretical thesis and pretending to go to the gym, I started knitting, or rather began practicing the fiber arts, joining a club of elites including Meryl Streep, Audrey Hepburn, and George Lucas. Not to mention, I am an excellent Netflix viewer in that I have a membership and use it frequently. Finally, in terms of workplace etiquette and behaviors, I never wear white after Labor Day, and I used to avoid wearing black-navy and brown-black combinations. However, after spending three years in the Northeastern Corridor, I have learned that these are not only accepted fashion choices, but that they are highly encouraged, thereby demonstrating my adaptability in a forever shifting socio-professional environment
Thank you for reading my application. Perhaps I should appreciate that you have taken the time to get to know me as a person. But if we are continuing our policy of total honesty, I should probably disclose that you know nothing about me. I could make the attempt at an introduction, but then there would be no shameless use of buzzwords and the contrived analyses of leadership failures to which you were so looking forward. Soon thereafter, you would realize that I was not the cookie-cutter applicant—or worse in some cases, that I was.
I have been told that my education grants me endless possibilities and that you would be lucky to have me. Take that as you will, and note that I have been described as “highly competent,” words that we have weirdly come to confuse with legitimate praise. But, don’t just take my word for it! After three years of being irrationally terrified to approach my incredible professors, I present you with my only true reference, the lady at CVS who regularly supervises me as I purchase pints of ice cream at least twice a week.
Please do not hesitate to ask me questions about my application. I am generally free any day of the week because I am literally doing nothing.
Sincerely,
Unemployed Senior

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, the three of us, and many Harvard undergraduates, each received a personalized email from Logan Leslie ’16, asking us to register to vote and vote for him in the Cambridge City Council race. Since then, he has had an active presence on campus, from door knocking in the dorms to distributing his campaign bottle openers throughout the school. We think it is important to take a closer look, however, at what Logan actually stands for.
 
A recent Crimson story covering the City Council race quoted Leslie saying, “It is good politics to say whatever you want to say if it’s against Harvard.” Leslie’s campaign website has similar talking points, such as, “City residents need to understand that the students live here too.”
This argument glosses over the thousands of Cantabrigians for whom Harvard has consistently made life difficult. It fails to address why saying things “against Harvard” might be true and even necessary.
Let’s look at some facts: Harvard’s nonprofit status allows it to pay 10 percent of what it would otherwise pay in taxes despite having more money than some small countries. In fact, it pays roughly 20 percent of what MIT pays to the city despite owning a roughly equal amount of real estate. Harvard resists paying some of its employees a livable wage, and it has secretly purchased real estate in Allston under the guise of a third party, while misleading the local community. Considering all this evasion, it is understandable why the 45 percent of Cambridge Public School families whose children are on free or reduced lunch might be frustrated with this institution. Rather than address how “students feel isolated from local government,” it may be a better use of Leslie’s time to address the residents feeling isolated from their local universities.
 
While on the subject of locals feeling isolated from Harvard, it’s worth addressing Leslie’s statements about Central Square and “the pit” in Harvard Square. Leslie’s website claims “Central Square isn’t safe or clean. Its large community of vagrants openly drinking, urinating, and taking drugs is an embarrassment.” About the pit, he says that “drugs are dealt and aggressive panhandlers abound.” To be fair, it only takes a walk through Central or Harvard Square to see many people suffering from homelessness or mental illness, leading them to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol.
But crime? Cambridge not being safe or clean? Is that really what Leslie should be focusing on when crime in Cambridge has dropped 10 percent compared to the average of the last five years?
As for those who suffer from homelessness and mental illness in Cambridge, what is Leslie’s solution? “Enough coddling. We need to clean up Central Square.” What exactly does that mean? Though we cannot speak for Leslie, we would be surprised if by "cleaning up" this population—a group whose lifestyle he seems to find undesirable—he means developing programs to address mental illness or permanent supportive housing. It is clear to us that this is the necessary approach, as such programs would not only extend a helping hand to those who need one the most, but are also proven to be the most cost effective methods in tackling such challenges. Until Leslie comments on potential implementation of measures such as these, his discussion of those suffering in Central and Harvard Squares is suspect.
In addition to an apparent lack of concern for the issues facing Cambridge’s working class and low-income residents, Leslie’s views also demonstrate a deeply flawed understanding of what the Cambridge City Council does and the type of representation students need.
Leslie’s email states that “1 in 5 residents in Cambridge is a student, and it's time the Council reflects that.” On a Council of nine members, his logic follows, why shouldn’t at least one be a student? Here’s why.
As students of Harvard College, we don’t attend Cambridge Public Schools. We don’t receive healthcare from the Cambridge Health Alliance. We’re protected by the Harvard University Police Department, we’re provided Harvard housing, we’re fed by Harvard University Dining Services, we study in Harvard libraries—we’re even subject to different alcohol policies than the rest of the city.
In fact, though students make up 20 percent of the city's population, few students pay property taxes, which make up the vast majority—about 85 percent —of the city's tax revenue. In one of the first cities to chant “No taxation without representation,” it’s unclear how much representation we should feel entitled to.
This is not to say that we as students are never faced with the consequences of Council decisions. But are we entitled to one-ninth of the decision-making power in the city when we are only temporary residents, when many Council decisions don’t even affect us, and when we contribute so little of its revenue?
Logan Leslie is able to find our emails on the Harvard College Facebook and to give out free bottle openers. But are Leslie’s views, which stigmatize the most marginalized members of our society, representative of our student body? Are local measures to combat obesity and reduce pollution “silly and unneeded,” as he calls them on his website? Can we trust Leslie, whose website and campaign materials omit his status as a registered Republican (information available from the City of Cambridge by request), to be honest and transparent? Ask yourself: Does he deserve our vote?
We certainly hope not.

With another year comes another round of Nobel Prizes. But there seems to be a perennial outlier in the family of awards. While prizes such as Physics and Literature are awarded to luminaries with substantive and thoroughly scrutinized contributions, the Nobel Peace Prize is consistently awarded before the fact. It is often given to promote political causes that are popular at the time; it rewards short-term fame, not long-term merit. This practice degrades the credibility of this important award in the public eye.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the group tasked with eliminating the use of chemical weapons in Syria, won this year’s Peace Prize, an obvious, positive response to its current high-profile mission. Yet although the group’s work may be important, it has not yet been accomplished, let alone shown to contribute to lasting international peace. In fact, within Syria itself, the al-Assad government has publicly praised the Peace award choice while the Syrian opposition has sharply criticized it for sugarcoating the reality of al-Assad’s extensive atrocities using conventional weapons. Indeed, it is unclear that the removal of chemical weapons will improve peace in Syria in any meaningful way.
Furthermore, some Peace recipients had not yet even made concrete progress toward the achievements for which they were recognized.  Barack Obama famously won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. Unfortunately, the Norwegian Nobel Committee naively conflated Obama’s lofty rhetoric with results—messages of “hope” and “change,” while appealing, do not constitute any actual work towards peace.
Certainly, the Committee may have thought that awarding Obama the prize would further the vision of international cooperation that Obama often touted on the campaign trail. Ironically, though, in the few years since Obama won the prize, his administration has staunchly defended, among other controversial policies, the use of deadly drone strikes in other countries and the widespread surveillance of millions of Americans in the name of national security. Obama’s presidency if anything has been marked by conflict with the international community, not peace. The Peace Prize seems meaningless when it is handed out before any actual accomplishments. It seems even ridiculous when its recipients’ actions are contrary to the spirit of the award.
Instead, if the Norwegian Nobel Committee wants to maintain the reputation of the Peace Prize, it should recognize those whose work has had meaningful, lasting impact; that is, it is should adopt the standard that the other awards already follow. Of course, promoting fashionable causes and celebrities might draw attention to those issues and convey the Committee’s support. Too often, though, this motivation supersedes the emphasis on real achievements.
Ultimately, the value of the Peace Prize depends on the value of the “peace” it recognizes—if it continues to be awarded prematurely, before that “peace” is realized, the Peace Prize risks falling into irrelevancy.

Undergraduate Council representatives raised concerns with the current state of UC finances at Sunday’s general meeting.
Many of these concerns addressed the tight UC budget, which has severely hindered the Council’s ability to provide full funding for many student organizations. Though the budget has remained relatively constant over the past few years, the number of student organizations requesting grants funding each year has increased.
At the meeting, the Council unanimously voted to provide more than $32,000 in funding—approved at last Wednesday’s Finance Committee meeting—to various club sports groups on campus. The amount was about the same as previous funding levels for those student groups.
However, as Finance Committee chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14 noted in the legislation, this was 54 percent less than the amount of funding the Finance Committee would have provided to club sports groups had the Council not been facing a budget constraint.
“This [was] by far the most painful meeting I’ve ever been in on the UC,” Marotta said in his presentation to the Council, referring to last Wednesday’s Finance Committee meeting. “When we whittled the numbers down … that’s [money] all of these clubs could have used.”
The Council discussed various methods to address the issue of student group funding, including an additional push for the administration to increase the $75 term-bill fee paid by all Harvard students, which serves as the Council’s greatest funding source.
“Recently we heard from the [Office of Student Life] that [the term-bill increase] is not happening and is under review,” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said at the meeting. “At this point, we are feeling the cuts every week … and also, more importantly, [it is] not good for student groups if they’re consistently not getting the funding that they need.”
Representatives plan on soliciting feedback from campus organizations regarding how grant funding cuts would affect their activities. They plan to compile these accounts in a report that they will eventually present to administrators to strengthen their case for an increase in student group funding.
The Council also discussed the revised campaign spending limit for UC presidential elections made by the UC Election Commission.
According to the new rules, the Council will allocate a maximum total of $900 for campaign reimbursements, with each campaign subjected to a spending limit of between $150 and $250 for campaign materials. These rules significantly reduce the spending limit from last year, when each campaign was allowed to spend up to $400 on campaign materials.
Rules Committee chair Kevin H. Xiong ’17 said that the change was made not only to conserve money in the UC budget but also because presidential and vice presidential candidates typically have not reached the previous spending limit.

Mexican eatery Felipe’s Taqueria will move from its current location to the space formerly occupied by Bertucci’s on Brattle Street and will expand its menu offerings to include alcohol and seafood options around February 2014, according to co-owner Tom Brush.
Brush said he and his co-owner Felipe Herrera have been actively looking over the last few years to move the location from The Garage, at 83 Mt. Auburn St., to another spot in Harvard Square.
“But it wasn’t until just a few months ago that we were able to secure the Bertucci’s space,” Brush said.
Bertucci’s shuttered its doors Aug. 21 after 25 years on Brattle Street, following the landlord’s decision to seek a new tenant.
When Bertucci’s closed in August, a representative from the Cambridge License Commission said no application had been filed to fill the vacancy.
When reached by phone on Monday, Richard Getz, whose company operates several Square properties including Felipe’s new location at 21 Brattle St., referred the request for comment on Felipe’s move to Brush.
Brush said he anticipates that the new location will open in February of next year, while the current storefront will remain open until its lease expires in March 2014. The owners are currently renovating the Brattle space, which is more than double the size of the existing Felipe’s, according to Brush.
“There’s a tremendous amount of work to be done,” Brush said. “It’s going to be a whole new space.”
Brush said that the substantial increase in square footage will give the restaurant ample opportunity to expand its offerings, such as the addition of fresh fish and shrimp dishes to the standard Felipe’s menu and the ability to make all the tortillas from scratch in lieu of purchasing them from the outside.
“This is just a great location. The Garage is good, too, but this allows us some outdoor seating,” Brush added.
The new Felipe’s will also offer alcoholic beverages, unlike the current location, which Brush said follows with Bertucci’s 25-year tradition of serving beer and wine. The store’s hours—currently 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. from Sunday to Wednesday and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday—will remain the same, according to Brush.
“Felipe and I are just so excited to be able to secure this location,” Brush said. “There will certainly be a lot more to see as the months move on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the back nine to play on championship Sunday at the Ivy League Match Play, the Harvard men’s golf team was keeping pace with Yale, with almost every individual matchup too close to call. In a battle that came down to the 18th pin, a few breaks went in favor of the Bulldogs, who pulled out the 4-3 victory.
“I liked very much where we were at around ten holes,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Had [senior] Kevin [McCarthy’s] match gone the other way, [sophomore] Rohan [Ramnath’s] opponent chipped in on the last hole to win one up, and [freshman] Kendrick [Vinar’s] match could’ve gone the other way…. There were some tight matches that could’ve gone either way.”
By defeating Brown, 4-3, Princeton, 6-1, and second-seeded Harvard, 4-3, for the title, Yale improved upon its fourth place finish at last year’s Ivy League Match Play.
Starting from the opposite side of the playoff bracket that included each of the Ancient Eight Ivy League teams, Crimson began the weekend with a tight 4-3 win over Cornell in the first round and a 5-2 victory over Columbia.
The second-place finish concludes an up and down fall season for Harvard that began with a second-place showing at the Doc Gimmler. Facing tougher competition, the team came in 15th out of 16 teams at the Windon Memorial before bouncing back to tie for fourth at the Temple Invitational last weekend.
Despite this weekend’s end result, the Crimson showed promise and improvement that it hopes to carry into the spring season.
“Obviously we came up a little short, and we’re disappointed because we came here to win,” Vinar said. “But I also think we can take away a lot of positives from the week and are motivated extra to work harder during the offseason.”
YALE 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard found itself in a hole early on in its second match of the morning, falling behind, 2-0, in total games against the Bulldogs.
With the match slipping away, the Crimson looked to captain Theo Lederhausen to spark a comeback. Though Lederhausen putted his way to a one-up victory over his Yale opponent, the rest of the team came short of the win. Freshman Daniel De La Garza lost 4&3, Ramnath fell after his opponent chipped in on the 18th and Vinar lost 2&1.
Up three holes with eight to play, McCarthy tweaked his wrist shooting out of the rough on the 11th hole and the injury affected his play. Though he battled through the final holes, McCarthy was unable to maintain the lead, in what Rhoads described as “what turned out to be the pivotal match.”
Along with Lederhausen, freshman Robert Deng and junior Akash Mirchandani pulled out two-hole victories to cut the final deficit to one.
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 2
For its semifinal match, Harvard faced a Columbia team that had the 33rd lowest scoring average in the NCAA coming into this weekend’s tournament.
But strong play by freshman Daniel De La Garza and Ramnath, who both birdied a difficult fifth hole, helped put the Crimson up, 2-1, before tournament officials suspended play late Saturday evening due to darkness.
With the four remaining matches having four holes to go, play resumed the next morning at dawn. Keyed by quality play all-around, Harvard kept up the momentum into Sunday, picking up the four matches necessary to clinch the win. Deng won his match 3&2, while junior Akash Mirchandani came out on top as well.
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 3
Although McCarthy’s eagle on the third hole at the Trump National Golf Course and birdie on the par three sixth jump-started the Crimson to an early lead Saturday morning, all he and the rest of his teammates could do was watch as Vinar lined up a six-foot putt on the 18th green.
With the match tied, 3-3, Vinar’s opponent converted a tricky up-and-down opportunity from a greenside bunker to put the pressure on Vinar, who had to two putt from 45 feet away to seal the victory for Harvard.
“I was on the far edge of the green, and I lagged [my first putt] up there to about five or six feet—I misread it,” Vinar said. “Everyone was gathered around the green and [my opponent] buried his 20-foot putt for par…. But I couldn’t worry about what my opponent was going to do…. I went through my routine and knocked it in for the win.”
“It was a really tight match,” Muphy said. “Most of the players were under par for their whole [round], even though we were playing match play.”

With the 2013 Heptagonal Championships only a few weeks away, both the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams were encouraged by strong individual performances across the board this weekend. Both teams pulled double duty on Saturday, with squads competing at both the elite Wisconsin Adidas Invitational and the Princeton Invitational.
 
The highlight for the Crimson came in the men’s race at Wisconsin. Senior standouts Maksim Korolev and James Leakos led Harvard with two top-ten performances against national competition as the team finished in 13th place, 15 spots higher than their 28th place finish last year. The women also improved, moving up to 18th from 23rd place.
 
Crimson harriers put forth strong showings at Princeton as well, with both teams taking ninth place overall.
 
WISCONSIN ADIDAS INVITATIONAL
 
Coming into the race at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational this weekend, Leakos had won his last two races, cruising to victory at both the Harvard-Yale meet and the Paul Short Invitational. While Leakos finished a strong tenth overall on Saturday, it was Korolev’s day to make a statement, as the senior finished two seconds out of first against almost 300 of the top runners in the country.
 
“I was really pleased with the way that the guys competed,” men’s coach Jason Saretsky said. “Their training has been going really, really well for a while now, and it was really good to see them mixing it up with some of the top guys in the country.”
 
Only 19 seconds separated the two seniors, who have been training partners all season. In a race populated by 18 nationally ranked cross country teams, including eighth-ranked Columbia, the Crimson was the lone squad to have two runners finish in the top 10.
 
“Obviously, looking at the results from today at both Wisconsin and Pre-Nationals, Columbia and Princeton are clearly two of the best teams in the league,” Saretsky said. “We’re hoping to be able to mix it up with them on the men’s side [at Heps] and have a real good go at it.”
 
Third-ranked Northern Arizona packed it in to win the meet in a score of 121, with only 38 seconds between their first and fifth runners. Harvard finished in 13th place with a score of 364, as sophomores Tom Purnell and Chris Allen and junior Will Geiken rounded out the scoring.
 
On the women’s side, the team was led by captain Morgan Kelly’s eighteenth place finish. Harvard was particularly encouraged, however, by the performances of sophomore Selena Pasadyn and freshman Madeleine Ankhelyi, who finished in the fourth and fifth positions for a Crimson squad that has not established a defined top five yet this season.
 
“We were really looking to have a good four and five today, and I think that’s starting to emerge,” women’s coach Priscilla Bayley said. “Selena Pasadyn ran as our number four, and she ran great.… She had a tremendous effort. You could just see this look of fearlessness on her face.”
 
Junior Viviana Hanley and senior Emily Reese covered the 6k women’s course in 20:55 and 21:09, respectively, to finish in second and third for the Crimson. The race was won by Arizona, which took advantage of top-ranked Providence’s lack of a fifth runner to upset the Friars with a score of 117 points.
 
PRINCETON INVITATIONAL
 
With Harvard’s top runners competing in Wisconsin, the rest of the men’s and women’s teams put up impressive results on a Princeton course that the team will be running on again at Heps in just a few weeks. The breakout performance of the day came from junior Molly Renfer, who blew through the 6K course in a PR of 21:40 to take fifth place overall.
 
“She was very aggressive from the beginning, went straight out with the leaders, and if she’d been out with us in Wisconsin, would have been in our top six,” Bayley said. “So we’re very excited about joining everyone together at Heps in a couple weeks.”
 
The men’s team also performed well, as the top five all finished within 32 seconds of each other. Junior Adam Cotton led the way, finishing 42nd overall in 24:44, and was followed quickly by sophomore Johnny Marvin and junior Ryan Meehan.
 
“To have three guys under 25 minutes on the course that we’re going to be seeing in two weeks was really, really great,” Saretsky said. “It bodes well for our depth, so we just have to get ready for the final push.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a jam-packed weekend for the Harvard sailing team, which competed in six regattas along the northern Atlantic coast.
Lane Trophy
It was a tough showing for the Crimson, who failed to win any of its match-ups in this in-conference lark regatta hosted by Tufts. The Jumbos came out on top, winning 83.3 percent of the races.
Five teams from four schools came out for Sunday’s round robin. Racing for Harvard was senior captain Ames Lyman, junior Richard Bergsund, sophomore Daniel Leichus, and freshmen Bennet Capozzi, Emma Wheeler and Olivia Kjorlien.
The regatta had three rounds, each with 10 face-offs of two teams that had their six sailors split into three boats. Harvard’s scores totaled higher than each of its competitors in every set, ending its day at 0-12.
Yale Women’s Intersectional
The Crimson headed down to Connecticut for a two-day FJ intersectional regatta on Saturday, but racing didn’t start until 2:30 in the afternoon due to heavy winds that kept the sailors onshore.
Yale finished on top, while the women sailors of Harvard placed 14th out of the 18 teams competing.
Caitlin Watson ’14 and Kristina Jakobson ’16 were in the A division while Sophie Bermudez ’16 and Ashleigh Inglis ’15 competed in the B division. Both squads finished in 14th place.
Captain Hurst Bowl
The poor sailing conditions were echoed up north on Mascoma Lake in New Hampshire, where Dartmouth hosted this intersectional regatta. The sailors couldn’t compete until 12:30 in the afternoon on Saturday due to the lack of wind.
Their luck turned around on Sunday when the 18 teams were met with much stronger and consistent wind, and officials were able to fit nine more races in before the day was over.
Despite the change in weather, the Crimson finished in 16th place. Harvard sent some of its more routine competitors to the regatta: Michael Drumm ’15 and Luke O’Connor ’14 in A and Gram Slattery ’15 and Julia Lord ’17 in B. Senior captain Isabel Ruane bounced between divisions.
“I think in general the two boats that sailed [there] were disappointed this weekend,” sophomore Jacob Bradt said. “They were struggling with starts and didn’t perform as well in a fleet as they thought they would.”
Navy Fall Invitational
The Crimson finished in fourth place in this large, four-division regatta down in Annapolis, earning its highest ranking of the weekend.
Each division differed by the type of boat being sailed, and Harvard sent down seven sailors to bring home a fourth place overall finish.
The Crimson’s strongest performances came from single-handed competitors. In Division C freshman Juan Perdomo finished second sailing a laser. Sophomore Marek Zaleski also finished second in the D division, sailing a radial.
Bradt competed in the C division in FJs with junior Brian Drumm. They came in sixth place.
“Overall, while we’re happy with our fourth place finish, we know we could have done better,” Bradt said. “We felt like we made a lot of unforced and silly errors that got us more 15s, 18s, and 19s on our score line than we would have wanted.”
Norm Reid Trophy
At the first round-robin regatta of the weekend, Harvard faced a small, yet competitive pool of opponents in this in-conference meet of 420s.
In the two rounds and final four, the Crimson competed just 10 times in the three-vs-three match-ups, failing to win a single one.
Roger Williams finished first with a sweeping 13-0 performance. The two teams from Tufts finished in the middle of the crowd.
It was a young group for Harvard, which sent junior Richard Bergsund and sophomore Daniel Leichus along with four freshmen: Olivia Kjorlien, Bennet Capozzi, William Bloxham, and Victor Kamenker.
Firefly and FJ Invite
The Crimson finished near the middle of the pack in this in-conference regatta on its home waters of the Charles. Of the 17 teams present, Harvard came in eighth place with 152 points. Tufts took home first, leading the scores with 71.
The Crimson did show improvement during the day when it cut its score from 96 and ninth place in the A division to 56 and fourth place in the B division.
Racing switched between FJ and Fireflies in each division.
Sophomore Adam Brodheim and freshman Emma Wheeler teamed up in A while freshman David Mende sailed solo in B.
Looking back on the weekend, Permero shared his thoughts on moving forward.
“I think we just need to get more regatta experience and be more mentally focused,” Permero said. “I think the skill set we already have. It’s more a matter of getting accustomed to this racing mentality and making sure the skills we learn in practice translate to the race course.”

This past weekend, the Harvard cross country team toed the line against some of the nation’s best programs at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational. Despite the deep field that included three of the top-ranked teams in the country, just two seconds separated co-captain Maksim Korolev from the individual victory.
Korolev took second place out of 288 runners at the elite invitational. The senior covered the 8k men’s course in 23:14, averaging 4:41 minutes per mile to set a new personal record.
The Crimson’s other co-captain, James Leakos, also finished in the top ten with a time of 23:33.
“James and I just went out moderately hard, and we just got out in a good spot and then we just slowly moved up to the front,” Korolev said.  “I just kept pushing with the front pack.”
Last year, Korolev also had a strong performance at the Wisconsin meet. He was Harvard’s first runner, coming in 20th with a time of 23:44—thirty seconds slower than this year’s time.
“Wisconsin’s always been good to me,” Korolev said.  “Last year I had a breakthrough race there, and I got 20th, and that was really good for me.  It’s a great course and just a really good place to race.”
To prepare for the Ivy Heptagonal Championships, which will be held at Princeton in two weeks, Korolev’s training regimen has become increasingly rigorous.
“He’s without a doubt training at a higher level than he’s ever trained before,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.  “It’s been really exciting.”
“I knew I was in good shape,” Korolev added.  “I knew it was possible to finish well [at the Wisconsin invite], but I just went out there and did what I could.”
Arkansas senior Kemoy Campbell edged out Korolev to earn first place at the meet. Campbell was in first place from the start, crossing the first mile mark in a blistering time of 4:38. Korolev was not far behind, coming through in 4:43.
Though Campbell had a ten-second advantage at the 5k mark, Korolev found himself in a tight pack that reached 5k in 14:46.
In the final stretch of the race, it came down to Campbell, Korolev, and North Carolina State’s Andrew Colley, who all crossed the finish line in a six-second span. The fourth-place finisher was 10 seconds behind Colley.
“[Korolev] and James Leakos have been doing an outstanding job this year, really taking care of the little things, and put in a great summer of training,” Saretsky said.
“I was pleased to see all the hard work paying off, and I’m excited for what the implications are for the rest of the season.”
In spite of the tough competition, the Crimson was the only school to place two runners in the top-10 at the meet. Northern Arizona, which won the team title, is ranked No. 3 in the country, and BYU and Portland, which are No. 5 and No. 7, respectively, rounded out the top-three in the team standings.
“Having two in the top ten at a major invitational like that really helps the rest of our team to see what the potential is here at Harvard and our program,” Saretsky said.
Korolev’s work ethic and leadership has earned him the respect of the younger members of the Crimson squad.
“He’s a really hard worker,” Marvin said.  “He’s always trying to do all the little extra things, whether it’s cross-training after running or doing core or form drills.  He’s always making sure he’s doing everything he can to be the best for the team…He keeps us motivated and working hard.”
Harvard will take next weekend off, but will be back in action at the most important meet of its season—the Ivy Heptagonal Championships.
“Everything we’ve done has really been geared toward the championship part of our season, so we are going to continue along with the plan that we set out at the beginning of summer,” Saretsky said.  “It should be a lot of fun to see how it all plays out.”
After their impressive performances this past weekend, Korolev and Leakos will be among the favorites to earn the individual title at Heps.
“I’m not really changing any expectations,” Korolev said.  “We are not discounting the Princeton guys, the Dartmouth guys, or any of the guys in the league.  But we’re definitely going to shoot for the top two.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a vital weekend triumph over Ivy opponent Brown, the Harvard men’s soccer team will look for its third consecutive win on Tuesday. The Crimson (3-6-2, 2-1-0 Ivy) will take on cross-town rival Boston College (5-5-2, 3-4-1 ACC) in what could be Harvard’s first victory against the Eagles since 2009.
The Crimson hopes to learn from its game against the Bears (3-6-3, 0-1-2 Ivy) as the team faces Boston College at 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
The greatest threat to Harvard could be Boston College freshman Zeiko Lewis, who is tied for the team lead in goals scored (two) and paces the Eagles in assists (seven). The Crimson must also be wary of sophomore Derrick Boateng, who ended the 2012 season ranked 17th among freshmen in the country.
Senior defender Chris Ager has led the Eagles from the back while still pressuring opposing teams’ defenses. Ager was named ACC Men’s Soccer Player of the Week earlier this season after he scored two goals against Boston University. BC won that game, its season opener, 2-1.
The last time Harvard played the Eagles, the Crimson gained the lead early, but BC responded in turn. The game went into double overtime and the teams eventually tied, 1-1.
“We have been working on our ability to adjust and continue pushing,” senior A.J. Agha said. “We need to play the full 90 minutes the same way we play the first 30 minutes.”
Early in the year, Harvard struggled to hold leads late in games.
The Crimson has lost four games so far this season by a one-goal deficit. In its game against Davidson, Harvard maintained its 1-0 lead with 20 minutes left to play. The team then relinquished a pair of late goals to the Wildcats, and ultimately lost the match, 2-1.
In a similar game against Yale, the Crimson led 1-0, but eventually lost, 2-1, due to a late goal from sophomore Bulldog Henos Musie with just 40 seconds left on the clock.
But things have changed of late.
Against Cornell on Oct. 12, Harvard gave up its 1-0 advantage in the 81st minute, but knocked in a game-winner in overtime to earn its first Ivy win in three years.
The Crimson extended its winning streak against Brown on Saturday.
“What was great for us was how we transitioned from the Cornell game to the Brown game,” co-captain Ross Friedman said.
The matchup against Brown marked the team’s first Ivy competition on home turf. The first half of play proved crucial to Harvard’s 2-1 victory.
“The first 35 minutes of the game, I think were the best that I’ve seen since I’ve been here on campus,” Friedman said. “Had we put away our chances…we could have had four or five goals within the first [half].”
The Crimson came onto the field ready to play, pressuring the Brown defense for the majority of the first half. Within the first 15 minutes of the game, Harvard outshot the Bears, 10-0.
The Crimson was finally able to capitalize in the 18th minute of play, thanks to Friedman’s well-placed pass that was tipped by junior Philip Fleischman to the ready feet of rookie Ashi Geberkidane. Eight minutes later, Geberkidane found the back of the net once again, this time with a header. Classmate Andrew Wheeler had the assist.
However, Brown refused to go down without a fight and soon responded with a goal of its own. Freshman Jack Gorab headed in his third goal of the season in the 35th minute of play.
Play evened out in the second half, with both teams continuing to put pressure on its opponent. Crimson goalie Evan Mendez made several critical saves in last few minutes of the game; however, the Bears nearly tied the game with three and a half minutes left to play.
Brown junior Alex Markes blasted a bending shot from just outside the 18-yard box. Mendez failed to get a hand on it, but the ball struck the far post and bounced clear of the danger zone.
Against the Eagles on Tuesday, Harvard will continue to focus on itself in the hopes of extending its win-streak to three.
“We want to focus on ourselves rather than on Boston College. We will go to practice and assess our own performance,” Friedman said. “We hope to identify the good things and to fix the bad.”

As much as every Harvard student loves the dining services, sometimes it’s nice—okay, necessary—to venture beyond the cafeterias and enjoy Cambridge’s culinary offerings. I certainly need breaks from my Annenberg meals and am always eager to go into the Square for food. Here are some of my recommendations and favorite spots for quick meals beyond HUDS:
1)   Crema Café →  Although a fire alarm went off the last time I was in Crema and I was forced to wait for twenty minutes outside (without my chaider—definitely try this by the way), there is no doubt that I will continue to return to Crema a few times every week. My mom gave me a gift card, it reminds me of Coupa Cafe, my favorite from back home in California, and the food is delicious. I recommend: the sweet potato sandwich (sweet potato, avocado, and hummus… literally what more could anyone want?); the Greek yogurt parfait with homemade granola, bananas, and fruit compote; the quiche; the almond earl grey latté.
2)   Clover → Clover is another place I will inevitably end up at quite often. It’s quick and conveniently located, and serves good food that’s not too expensive. I recommend: the chickpea fritter sandwich (includes hummus and falafel so what’s not to like); the daily lemonades—try the peach lemonade if they’re serving it; the apple fritters (to die for).
3)   Zinneken’s →  Craving waffles but want to try something beyond Sunday brunch Veritaffles? Head to Zinneken’s and I can guarantee you will not regret it. Choose between liege and Brussels waffles and then add toppings. My favorite is the liege waffle with Oreos, whipped cream, and raspberries… dangerous.
4)   Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe → If you’re looking for a good sandwich, go here. The sandwiches are tasty enough that I ate an entire one after my Zinneken’s waffle last weekend. I’m certain any sandwich would be great here, but my order is the caprese with prosciutto or the Parisian (brie with sliced green apple).
5)   Café Pamplona → Pamplona is the kind of cozy café that I live for. I recommend the guava and cheese sandwich, the paninis, and the lavender soda. Oh, and if you go between 7 p.m. and midnight, it’s 20% off for students.
So, take a few meals to explore food in the Square. We’re lucky to go to school in an urban area with good restaurants and should take advantage of it!

Fall has come to Harvard Yard and you know what that means—Halloween! An excuse to wear whatever costume you please and to gorge yourself on candy. Speaking of candy, if you’re going trick-or-treating to make up for the childhood you lost studying, the one candy that you should make sure to receive is candy corn.
For some absurd reason, it’s the most debated Halloween candy you will find. It’s like dining hall food—you hate it or you love it. Except for the fact that those who hate it are seriously confused. Prose cannot properly express the wonder of this creation, so poetry will try to suffice:
Oh candy corn! The treat so good, Oreos put it as a filling for its creamFor those who weren’t blessed to have tasted this wonderful treat,Candy corn is a corn kernel shaped special eat.
You can always have Dum Dums or Hershey’s chocolateAny time of the year,But it’s candy cornThat will bring the best Halloween cheer.
 
And if don’t want to repeatedly go to CVS to buy tons of these delicious treats,You can make them yourself, bon appetit!

After watching the University’s new admissions video, current Harvard students themselves will wish they went to Harvard.
 
The elaborately filmed and unnecessarily long 16-minute video (finally evidence that our tuition money is going to good use) is called “Anything Could Happen at Harvard.” Yes, it’s a play off of Ellie Goulding’s song. No, it isn’t any less cheesy or over-the-top than it sounds.
 
We totally understand why Harvard felt the need to make this video. Let’s be honest—it’s hard to deal with catastrophes like having a mere $32.7 billion endowment and a lowly 34,000+ yearly applicants. But alas, Harvard always finds a way to prevail against these seemingly insurmountable problems. In response to its meager endowment, Harvard launched its new $6.5 billion capital campaign. And in response to its paltry number of applications, Harvard released its new video.
 
If you’ve seen “The Social Network,” then you know the John Harvard statue is also called the statue of three lies. If you go to Harvard, then you know this admissions video also contains many lies. Here are three of the video’s most glaring untruths:
 
1. That you will go into Boston.The video opens with shots of Boston on a gorgeous sunny day. Pay close attention, prospective students—and current students, too, actually—as this is the closest to Boston you’ll ever get. You will not go into Boston on beautiful, blue-sky days because a) this is New England and there are about two nice days a year and they’re in June and you won’t be here and b) you will be too busy doing p-sets in Lamont every day to venture across the river.
 
2. That you will eat breakfast.The video shows not one, but two scenes with people eating breakfast. “Breakfast? What’s that?” current Harvard students are no doubt wondering. “But you don’t even have class until, like, 10 a.m.,” prospective students are thinking, “surely you can squeeze breakfast in before then.” Wrong. The truth of the matter is that you will not eat breakfast if your first class is at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. or even 4 p.m. You will not eat breakfast at Annenberg or the Houses (obviously, because they don’t even have hot breakfast). You will not eat breakfast here or there. You will not eat breakfast anywhere. You will eat brunch though. And by brunch, I mean veritaffles.
 
3. That you could become Jeremy Lin ’10 or Matt Damon, formerly of the Class of 1992, if you go to Harvard.First of all, props to Harvard for getting Matt Damon to appear in its admissions video. But, come on, he didn’t even graduate. Anything could happen at Harvard, but not really, because if you’re five-foot-one, it doesn’t matter what school you go to, you’re just not going to be a basketball player. And if you really want to be a professional basketball player, may I suggest Duke? Half of Harvard students can’t even name a player on our basketball team.
 
Prospective students should know that while this video isn’t a super accurate portrayal of the Harvard experience, it does contain at least one truth. Fast forward to the last minute-and-a-half where everyone says their name and where they’re from. This is orientation week at Harvard.
 
Conversations about the cost of college usually begin and end with the big numbers: tuition, room and board, activities fees, and all the other items that will appear on your term bill. But between sending test scores and application fees, the costs can add up even before you’re accepted to a school. Luckily, a little bit of research and some time with your guidance counselor can help you work around these fees—or get rid of them altogether.
Cost Breakdown
The application: According to U.S. News, the national average cost of applying to colleges for the Class of 2017 was $38.39 per application, though some schools charged applicants up to $90.The application fee is usually listed with the application or on the school’s admissions website.
SAT: The SAT allows students to send four free score reports during registration, but oftentimes that’s not enough. Additional score reports cost $11.25, and there is no limit on the number that can be sent.
ACT: You have several options of how to send your ACT scores: an additional report will set you back $12.00, while priority reports, which are delivered faster, cost $16.00.
 
Advanced Placement: You can choose a recipient for your score report when registering for test, but chances are you hadn’t yet finalized your college application list at the end of junior year. Additional reports are $15 each when ordered online, and if you’re in a hurry, you can add rush processing for $25 per report.
 
Waivers
While the fees needed to put together an application can seem daunting, several programs are available to help defray these costs. The National Association of College Admissions Counseling grants applicants with demonstrated financial need up to four application waivers. (Find more information and the application here.) Similarly, the College Board’s waiver program for students with financial need offers a waiver for the cost of two SATs, two SAT Subject Tests, sending score reports, and up to four application fees. (Find eligibility requirements and more details here and the directory of participating schools here).
 
Even if you don’t qualify for these waiver programs, be sure to research your options. Take your master list of schools and look into each one’s costs and any possible waivers; some schools even waive the fee if you apply online or on campus rather than send in a paper application. If you’re a senior taking the SAT or subject tests in the fall, take advantage of the four free score reports. Finally, your guidance counselor may know of other waiver programs or schools with lower application costs—take advantage of their knowledge during your application process.
Overall, these fees for applications and sending test scores shouldn’t deter you from applying to your dream school. Like other stages of the college application process, make it work for you.
