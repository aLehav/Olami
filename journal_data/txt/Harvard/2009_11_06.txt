After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyday, regardless of Boston’s variable weather, thousands of graying tourists stumble through the gates of Harvard, flattening students, taking pictures of every irrelevant detail possible, and saying things like “Wow, this is just like a movie set.” Recently though, this has become a literal reality as large film productions roll into Boston and Cambridge. Ben Affleck has graced the grimy pit of the Harvard T station, John Hamm has been spotted outside burrito joints, and Katie Holmes has been mobbed while eating cupcakes with her daughter Suri. Perhaps it’s just my Boston-is-always-cold-and-dark pre-winter bias kicking in, but I find myself slightly skeptical about Boston’s increased exposure.
Traditionally when people think of Boston films, a few are quick to come to mind: “Love Story,” “Goodwill Hunting,” and more recently “The Departed.” In each of these movies, there is a clear reason why Boston is crucial to the plot—Harvard, MIT, police brutality. But consider these movies: “Bride Wars,” “Paul Bart: Mall Cop,” and“Pink Panther 2.” Believe it or not, each of these movies (and many other box office bombs like them) were also recently filmed in the greater Boston area. But why?
For the most part, the answer is sample—tax breaks! Up until about five years ago, there was no major financial incentive to bring studio movies to Massachusetts. That was until then-Governor Mitt Romney signed in a series of laws that gave significant tax breaks to large film productions.
A section on the policy found on the Massachusetts Film Office website reads: “Studios, producers and filmmakers–who either shoot at least half of their movie or spend at least half of their production budget in the Commonwealth–are eligible for a tax credit equal to 25 cents for every new dollar of spending they bring to Massachusetts.”
The idea behind this 25% break is to reel in film production and, in doing so,, stimulate the Massachusetts economy. The MFO claims that, in 2008 alone, the tax breaks led to $452 million in “direct spending,” and they have a star-studded picture on their homepage bearing the header, “Meet Massachusetts Newest Taxpayers.” They also add elsewhere on the site that Massachusetts’ movies have received a total of 60 Academy Award nominations.
The reasoning behind this plan is nothing new. Many states have similar breaks, and some, like Michigan’s, are actually higher. States want to stimulate the economy in their bigger cities while advertising to tourists and making their urban centers seem “cool.” But Boston is “cool” in no senses of the word; it’s cold most of the year, and it can be, at times, a fairly miserable place to live.
As movies like “Fever Pitch” would make you believe, Boston is the most cohesive, fun-loving, patriotic, American, and classy place on earth. They do have the Red Sox after all. In reality, Boston is one of the most intensely segregated cities in America, both racially and socio-economically, it has one of the harshest and longest winters of mainstream American cities, and its inhabitants are less friendly than New Yorkers and Philadelphians combined. National “road rage” surveys consistently rank Boston as one of the worst cities in the country. Enough said.
I appreciate movies adapted from Dennis Lehane’s novels, like “Mystic River” and “Gone Baby Gone,” for portraying Boston in all of its honest dreariness and stratification. But with big tax breaks and even bigger budgets on the line, it’s in Hollywood’s interest to airbrush away Boston’s flaws. If you consider though that right now, there is a Tom Cruise movie, two Ben Affleck movies, an Adam Sandler film, and a movie about Facebook starring Justin Timberlake all being filmed in Boston at the same time, it’s not hard to imagine how good Hollywood is going to try and make Boston look.
When we think of movies set in cities like New York, Paris, and Los Angeles, we can often see the city itself become a character in all of its greatness and eccentricities. A city like Boston, though, lacks the kind of cosmopolitan personality that factors so greatly into movies-set-in-cities. Perhaps greater exposure will help open up the city to beneficial change?
In terms of insincerity, the Massachusetts government has met Hollywood halfway. In an effort to drum up business, Massachusetts has sold itself to products it has no control over and, for better or for worse, could suffer from false advertising. At the same time, Hollywood seems to be selling out to a city that hasn’t yet earned the special treatment.
What’s more is that a recent Massachusetts Department of Revenue report stated that the tax break program is not nearly as economically simulative as once thought. In what looks to be quite unfair to Massachusetts taxpayers, the government is only receiving about 16 cents on the dollar for their investment in Hollywood. According to the report, over 80 percent of tax breaks on actor and crew salaries are paid to out-of-state workers.
In essence, the increased filming in Boston is a losing situation for all involved parties. Massachusetts isn’t getting the kind of revenue it wants, residents are forced to accommodate massive film crews, Hollywood is choosing economy over aesthetics, and audiences are courted by a city that might not really be interested. Lose-lose-lose-lose situation.
Death from brain tumors, death from gangs and police brutality, and the Red Sox winning the World Series—these are all typical endings to movies set in Boston. If they’re going to keep making movies here, at least they can start making them have happy endings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bare stage is the birthplace of a dancer’s art—a space where emptiness is the presence preceding emergence, the incubator for stories narrated through movement. On a particular Thursday night, seven members of the Harvard Ballet Company mill about the Loeb Mainstage; with a few preparatory jumps, they gauge the pliancy of the marley floor before beginning rehearsal of a piece from the Company’s latest production, “Momentum.”
Turning his back to five hundred empty seats that will be filled this time next week, choreographer David F. “Ricky” Kuperman ’11 calls out instructions as the dancers mark individual movements and walk through formations. When Kuperman requests a full-out execution of a few eight-counts, the dancers unveil a spectacular range of movement, collectively brushing through a front “attitude” position into a stag leap and “chasse” effortlessly into two diagonal lines.
They work on fragments of Kuperman’s piece for an hour; Elizabeth C. Walker ‘11—one of the show’s directors and a performer—has a “cabriole” injected into her step sequence to smooth out a transition, while standardizing arm movements are added to an ensemble segment. Kuperman stops Kevin Shee ’11 to give him a pointer on the artistic delivery of his solo entrance: “This needs to be so grounded—like a mummy coming to life. Everything starts in the core of the body.” Shee follows Kuperman’s example, inhaling sharply to incorporate the tense, almost convulsive movement into his body language.
As the rehearsal hits its midpoint, Kuperman’s conclusion that “the main critique is that you’re too pretty,” draws a laughing assent from the dancers. After all, this dance does deviate from classically beautiful performances like Petipa’s “Giselle” and Balanchine’s “Diamonds”; like all six pieces programmed for “Momentum”—which will run from Nov. 6 to 14—it is an experiment in fusing the traditional with the contemporary, the familiar with the unknown, and the sure-fire audience pleaser with the black-horse hit. HBC’s production, though created in the hours between classes, aims to push beyond the mediocrity of convention towards an ambitious, innovative vision. As a student group undertaking, “Momentum” is reflective of how far Harvard dance has been able to come despite being an extracurricular program, but it also displays the limits HBC will continue to face until it becomes a full-fledged endeavor.
UP HIGH
Over the past 10 years, the Harvard ballet program has become one of the strongest among Ivy League schools, according to dance director Elizabeth Bergmann. During her tenure, a number of Dramatic Arts courses have been added, more and more accomplished performers have been visiting as guest artists, and in 2005, the Harvard Dance Center opened.
“I danced in the Program and with HBC when I was a grad student in ’03, and there is a palpable difference in the Harvard dance scene now,” assistant dance director Kristin Ing Aune writes in an email. “While the Dance Program has always attracted talented dancers, we have increased visibility for a number of reasons: our accomplished graduate-ambassadors, performances, roster of guest artists, the Task Force on the Arts, the internet, word of mouth... dance is alive and well at Harvard.”
The notable improvement of the Dance Program has attracted an increasing number of talented students, many of whom join HBC. Its current membership includes dancers who trained for nearly a decade at the School of American Ballet (the New York City Ballet’s feeder training academy), others who performed on national tours with professional dance companies, and a contestant on “So You Think You Can Dance Canada.”
“A lot of these students come highly trained,” Bergmann says. “In their form ballet, some of them are really, really good. Some of them are exceptional. Some of them were professional dancers before they came to Harvard.”
A roster of this caliber enables HBC to accomplish what many other student dance groups do not; supported by professional coaching and workshops with leaders on the Boston dance scene and beyond, HBC aspires to and is able to achieve world-class performance standards.
THE MAIN DRAG
HBC conceived “Momentum” as an eclectic, high-level dance production demonstrating the potential and direction of 21st century dance months ago, when it considered staging a follow-up to its 2006 showcase of 20th century dance, “American Grace.” Members immediately identified the Loeb Mainstage, home to the American Reperatory Theater and the largest theater space available on campus, as the Company’s ideal performance venue.
Since three student productions are selected to grace the Mainstage each year, the Company had to complete a rigorous application process—which included a 50-page document detailing the vision and merits of the show—to secure the space. Met with success, “Momentum” is now one of only four dance productions in Mainstage history, the last of which—“American Grace”—was three years ago.
HBC then proceeded to recruit a host of choreographers and dancers of an artistic caliber befitting the Mainstage’s prestige. Walker and co-director Merritt Moore ’11 commissioned professional choreographer Josie Walsh, whose work blending commercial dance with ballet and circus arts has electrified the Los Angeles dance scene, to create an original piece for the company.
“We were looking for [someone with] an interdisciplinary, forward-looking approach to dance, and Josie was really the perfect person,” Walker says. Walsh’s piece promises an extravaganza of movement that combines the daring technique of a Cirque de Soleil production, the throbbing musical energy of a rock concert, and the exhilarating drive of a hip-hop battle.
“Composer [Paul Rivera] will perform with us on stilts, singing and playing guitar, along with a chamber ensemble of Harvard student musicians. Harvard alum[na] and aerial silk artist Marin Orlosky will be suspended eight feet in the air as dancers, a stilt-walker, and musicians perform on the stage below her,” Walker elaborates.
Recent Harvard graduates Larissa D. Koch ’08 and Claudia F. Schreier ’09, both of whom are currently pursuing careers as professional choreographers, are returning to stage two pieces for “Momentum.” Schreier’s work will feature live piano accompaniment and inventive costuming. In a similarly unique fashion, Koch—who performed with HBC throughout her undergraduate career and currently directs her own dance company—has collaborated with electroacoustic specialist and Harvard Music Professor Hans Tutschku to create a piece tailored to Tutschku’s original, HBC-commissioned score.
“I was incredibly lucky to be paired with [Tutschku],” Koch says. “He’s a really responsive composer, so I wasn’t just creating a dance to music that already existed.”
“We made this together, and we got to have an artistic dialogue. That is not something you get every day.”
STEPPING IT UP
Professional work will share the Mainstage with student choreography in “Momentum”, which will feature original pieces by Ricky D. Kuperman ’11, Nina K. Stoller-Lindsey ’10, and Patrick H. Quinn ’10.
Quinn, a computer science concentrator, reiterates the multidisciplinary dimension of the show by melding technology with dance. His piece will employ a video installation onstage to complement the energetic movements of his dancers.
Kuperman’s piece “tells the story of a sculptor whose creations betray him and the frustrations that accompany... the [realization] that the statues’ allegiances don’t lie where he thought they did.”
“As a choreographer, [I] want to walk a fine line between mime and dance,” Kuperman says, describing his approach to staging a narrative dance. “I find myself abstracting many of these plot points.”
“It’s amazing how explicit you need to be for an audience to catch on, but I [still] think it’s refreshing to have a story,” the Psychology concentrator continues, expressing hope that the combination of his choreography, complex lighting effects, set design, and use of props will help the audience bridge the gap between movement and its underlying chronicle.
Stoller-Lindsey set her work to three pieces of music by percussionists Tigger Beford and Peter Jones, whose contemporary dance compositions highlight funky, eccentric sounds from prepared piano. “My [choreography] is not that balletic, though a lot of my dancers are ballet-trained,” says Stoller-Lindsey, whose choreographic background is rooted in modern dance. “It’s theatrical, gestural, and athletic.”
Stoller-Lindsey explained the challenges and rewards of the rehearsal process: “There’s always a struggle for choreographers to take something [they] create on [their] own bodies and put it on someone else.” During the first rehearsal, Stoller-Lindsey asked her dancers to improvise to “get a sense of the way they move and respond to the music.”
“I try to be really aware of the ‘accidents’ that happen, the things that people do wrong that actually wind up working really well,” Stoller-Lindsey says of her decision to incorporate some of these accidental movements into her final choreographic scheme.
While these students, unlike their professional counterparts, do not have the luxury of spending all their days dancing, their Harvard education informs their work for the better. “I think any creative process is an aggregate of one’s experiences,” Kuperman says of his two-plus years at Harvard. “I don’t doubt that the shows I’ve seen here, the museums I’ve been to, and the people I’ve met, have influenced what I think about and how I translate those experiences to the stage.”
HANGING IN THE BALANCE
Given the pure scale and complexity of “Momentum,” it is easy to forget that the show is run entirely by full-time students whose responsibilities match those of any other undergraduate on campus.
“It’s definitely a challenge when you bring in professional choreographers like Josie Walsh who are used to working with dancers who rehearse eight hours a day for a living,” Walker says regarding the difficulty of rising to HBC’s professional dance standards while balancing a full course load and other commitments.
“Since the choreographers are used to such a high level of talent, we really feel like we have to be on top of our game,” Walker continues, pointing out that the short residency of most guest choreographers often necessitates a grueling sequence of six-hour rehearsals on weekends that spill into four-hour sessions on weekdays. Two Sundays ago, Company members remained at the Loeb from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., going home exhausted and sore after a marathon session of hanging lights and setting up the theatre.
With days as long as these, excelling in both school and dance becomes a challenge. “[It is] incredibly difficult to keep my body in good shape for dance when [I] am forced to replace ballet technique class with last-second problem sets or papers,” says Kevin Shee ’11, who has danced professionally but plans to pursue a medical career.
Still, Shee believes the benefits of dancing with HBC are well worth the physical and academic sacrifices. “It’s been hard on my body, but it really makes me appreciate the joy that comes with every dance step–it makes all those late nights more bearable,” Shee says.
Co-performer Samantha C. Cohen ’12 (who is also a comper on The Crimson’s arts board) echoes this sentiment, citing the value of bonding with fellow dancers, working with world-class choreographers and staging state-of-the-art performances. “It can definitely get a little stressful during intensive rehearsals, especially... as it gets closer to performance time,” she says, “but in the end, those are the amazing experiences that we get to share as a company.”
THE TIPPING POINTE
Though members of HBC balance their commitments as students and dancers gracefully, there are inherent limits to what they can achieve at a liberal arts college with little curricular focus on dance.
“[HBC] is run by students, so they try and work really hard,” Bergmann says. “But they’re also trying to study; they have another concentration.”
The Harvard Dance Program, also limited to the extracurricular realm, shares similar constraints. “I think our Harvard students come in and are very prepared and smart so they can pull it off,” says Bergmann, who is not considered a full-fledged faculty member. “But at administrative levels there’s no faculty representation. I’m not privy to the decision making here in dramatics, theater and dance. We don’t have a voice at the table. And we need one. We’re still an extracurricular activity and viewed that way and not as important as a field study.”
For Bergmann, until dance achieves a status equal to academic departments on campus, the program, despite its improvements, will stagnate. “I think we’ve gone as far as we can go until we move into more curricular focus,” she says.
But back at Kuperman’s rehearsal, curricular reform is far from the dancers minds. Getting ready for a full run-through of the piece, they focus their energy on delivering a performance that effectively conveys the choreographer’s artistic concept and exceeds the standards upheld by the Company.
Shee tries a hands-free cartwheel, primarily to get his blood flowing again and secondarily to entertain his fellow dancers, whose movements maintain a hint of grace even as they laugh and make fun of their own mistakes.
The music begins, heightening as each of the “statues” is brought to life with powerful “fouette” jumps and fluid promenades on black boxes-turned-platforms. The subdivisions of the beat are inaudible, but the dancers move with a rhythmic cohesion built on a collective understanding of musicality and awareness of each others’ bodies.
Shee comes to life with a triple piourette into a few more turns in “coup de pied,” tacking on a double tour jump just for kicks. The other dancers flood center stage and crowd around him, relegating Kuperman’s frustrated character (the sculptor) to stage right.
Though at this moment the choreographer stands off to the side, there are hopes that his work, and all others featured in “Momentum,” will bring dance into the spotlight at Harvard.
“Will we get more money? Will we get more courses in dance? I don’t know,” Bergmann says of the show’s potential ramifications. “That depends on who comes, who might get influenced, who has a voice. I think that we can hope for some changes.”

The Wild Cat, a new bar in the basement of The Garage on JFK Street, has recently been serving up some extremely unusual fare. Until November 15, this dingy little watering hole will be home to “The Taming of the Shrew,” the most recent production by the Actors’ Shakespeare Project. This fictional bar acts as the backdrop for Shakespeare’s famous battle of the sexes, directed by OBIE-award winner Melia Bensussen.
While productions of “The Taming of the Shrew” traditionally focus on the play’s portrayal of gender stereotypes and the domestication of women, what intrigues Bensussen about the show is the idea of transformation. In the director’s notes, she writes, “Within the world of ‘Shrew,’ everyone is playing at what they are not, and class, as well as gender, are exposed as performances in which performer and viewer are complicit.”
Yet with all this emphasis on themes of change, the end product somehow seems stagnant throughout most of the evening. Bensussen uses Shakespeare’s lesser-known induction to the play as a sort of meta-theatrical framing device. This prelude to the show drops us into a typical bar atmosphere, complete with pretzels. A drunk stumbles in off the street, and the staff of the Wild Cat decides to play a prank on him, invoking the help of a drunken entourage who are forced to act out a play as punishment for not paying their tab.
Thus begins the actual story of “Shrew.” Bensussen manipulates this play-within-a-play trope to great success for the majority of the opening scenes. The actors take on their roles with the delightful awkwardness of children in a school play—scripts in hand, direction shouted at them mid-scene, and endearingly over-the-top line readings. Yet as the show progresses, the actors become more comfortable in their roles, and the production shifts from a clever tongue-in-cheek commentary on social performativity into a relatively normal presentation of Shakespeare’s play. The irony of this “Shrew” is that the better the acting gets, the worse the show becomes.
The biggest mistake with this production lies in the fact that Bensussen’s greatest innovation is a technique for framing the show—not for staging the show. This meta-theatricality is not enough to sustain a two-and-a-half hour production, and once the actors lose their scripts and take their roles on more fully, problems abound. The barroom décor no longer makes sense. Actor Ross Bennet Hurwitz is left in drag in the role of Bianca for the whole show, an odd move that seems to invite the audience to find gender commentaries in a production that claims to preference other themes. But beyond all else, we are left with a relatively plain production of “Shrew” that, despite some charming directorial flourishes from Bensussen, falls flat.
The production claims to conjure the ragged, gruff spirit of a bar, but it consistently fails to do so. In his introduction to the play, ASP Artistic Director Allyn Burrows invites the audience to “Get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on!” Yet even Kate, Shakespeare’s famous anti-heroine, feels oddly timid. Poorly executed fight choreography abounds, such as Kate’s unconvincing knee-to-the-crotch and the lame food fight which opens the second act. By that point, it feels as if the titular “shrew” has already been tamed. What’s left to watch after that?
The design elements in the show do little to help the audience engage with the production. As mentioned, the scenery is mostly just barroom décor completed by a totally inexplicable jigsaw pattern painted on the floor. The lighting has a few select moments where it explicates the atmosphere of a scene, but otherwise it does little to aid the drama at hand. The sound is a dismal effort, relying largely on tacky, cartoonish underscoring that reduces the tone of any given scene to garish musical stereotypes.
The acting is consistent, with a few standout performances. Benjamin Evett does admirably as both the drunken Christopher Sly and Petruchio, the conniving, arrogant man who weds Kate against her will and then domesticates her. He plays the obnoxious male bravado of the role to perfection, but again, this directorial move seems to invoke the ideas of gender relations in the play above themes of transformation. Beyond that, the casting (which includes eight men and only one woman, playing Kate) seems to play towards the gender themes as well. Bensussen may have been intrigued by Kate’s transformation rather than the conflict of genders, but the production itself certainly does not reflect that.
At the heart of ASP’s “The Taming of the Shrew” is an uninspiring staging of Shakespeare with one novel idea that runs out of steam before the action really starts. The production begins as a smart, entertaining, and stimulating evening of theater, but it quickly loses its way. While it has some redeeming qualities and moments throughout, this performance simply feels lackluster. You could pay a visit to the Wild Cat this coming week, but, frankly, your money would be better spent at a real bar.

Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Sorcerer” follows a fairly simple recipe: combine a cast of eccentric villagers with a powerful love potion and see what hijinks ensue. The new production by the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players  of the classic opera and satire of early Victorian life, which opened last night and runs through November 15 at the Agassiz Theatre, aims to successfully convey the piece’s whimsical nature.
The opera’s lighthearted plot runs as follows. As the residents of Ploverleigh celebrate the engagement of a couple, a sorcerer visits and creates a love potion which everyone drinks. Soon, the villagers begin falling in love with the first person they each set eyes upon, resulting in a number of comically mismatched couples.
“It’s really a charming little piece. It’s really funny, really cute. It’s all about love and magic,” says stage director Davida Fernandez-Barkan ’11. “I think it’s a really beautiful show.” Though the show was originally conceived in Victorian England, this particular production’s styling and costume will be decidedly more Elizabethan. “Shows get taken to the present a lot, and I thought it would be fun to take a show back.” Originally, the plan was to set the production in medieval times, but anachronisms such as a vicar getting married prevented that from becoming a plausible reality.
“Gilbert and Sullivan is just really fun plotlines that people can enjoy, and the music is beautiful,” says Marit A. Medefind ’12, who portrays Aline Sangazure. Her character’s relationship with her soon-to-be-husband Alexis Pointdextre is one of the key relationships of the plot.
Zander J. MacQuitty ’10, in his sixth production with the HRG&SP, plays Alexis, describing him as the character that sets everything in motion. “He’s convinced that love will solve all problems. He’s obsessed with the notion of love being indiscriminate to age, rank, beauty, fortune, and [of it being] the cure for all ills,” he says. Those who attend the show on both weekends of its run will get to see two different takes on the role, however. Scheduling conflicts necessitated that Ben J. Nelson ’11 covers the part for the first weekend, while MacQuitty will play the part next weekend.
Medefind has encountered no problems having to perform with two different takes on her suitor’s character; in fact, she has nothing but praise for each actor. “They’re both fantastic. Each of the respective couples have really great chemistry. We each have different interactions and ways we do things onstage. It’s different but fun and fabulous.”
Noting the hard work the entire cast and crew have put in, Sofia M. Selowsky ’12, a campus opera veteran who plays Lady Sangazure, is very confident about the show. “The whole crew has been absolutely fantastic and very efficient and organized. I’m hoping people will find it funny and we’re working with some special effects this year, which will be cool,” she says. These effect-laden sequences, which include a scene where one character is swallowed into the fires of hell, help add action to the quaint humor on display throughout the opera.
Describing Gilbert and Sullivan’s works, Fernandez-Barkan praises their lightheartedness and accessibility. “They’re whimsical and wonderful,” she says. Other cast members call Gilbert and Sullivan works absurd, hilarious, and even topsy-turvy. With this enthusiasm for their subject matter, it’s clear that the cast and crew are far from stressed about their work on the opera. If that translates onto the stage, the result is sure to be a lighthearted, harmonious, and humorous production.

In 1851 Gustave Courbet painted “A Burial at Ornans,” an enormous depiction of a country funeral, with cloaked townsfolk surrounding a priest and an open grave. Its classical style and enormous size all smacked of historical and religious importance; but Courbet’s choice to depict an everyday, contemporaneous funeral set in a rural area found modernity through an exultation of the commonplace. The painting itself was a radical upending of hierarchies. Courbet demonstrated the self-consciousness that sets modernism apart: a form of expression that, even as it acknowledges its tradition, eschews it.
Such self-consciousness is the mark of much modern writing as well—quite notably, that of Paul Auster. Auster is a master of metafiction, writing about stories and within stories, writing about writers and the act of writing. From his initial success with 1987’s “New York Trilogy” to more recent novels like 2004’s “Oracle Night” and now with “Invisible,” Auster continues to surround his novels’ protagonists in layers of text.
Auster’s concern is in the self-conscious depiction of the confusion of his characters; digging through books and words and letters to find truth, to find something—to find themselves. The protagonist of “Invisible,” Adam Walker, does just this; he looks for himself in Paris and looks at himself in letters. His quest is one of identity, but strangely, Auster’s almost simplistic prose leaves Walker as effervescent and fleeting as the novel itself.
The novel’s narrative mirrors the character’s existential crisis: Walker’s point of view (one among three) varies from first- to third-, and even second-person. The story opens in the first-person, from Walker’s perspective, on the streets of New York City in 1967: a student and writer at Columbia University, Walker meets at a party the inscrutable Rudolf Born—a professor who soon thereafter offers to finance a literary magazine that would have Walker at its helm. This role provides Walker with a definitive, if transient, identity—as he realizes: “It was the first time I had dressed up in months, and there I was, Mr. Important himself, walking across the Columbia campus with an enormous bouquet of flowers in my right hand, on my way to eat and talk business with my publisher.” This first part of the novel, we later learn, is a manuscript mailed to the second narrator: James Freeman, Walker’s college friend. This flourish of ‘infinite regress’ emphasizes Walker’s quest, 40 years later, to find who he was and who he is in paper and ink.
Auster continues exploring Walker’s past: a shocking tragedy that changes him and his perception of himself, then his sexual exploits in New York and Paris, and later interactions with Born that bring the truth into a somewhat brighter—though still dim—light. This truth is found in the fourth section, in a combination of Freeman’s words and the diary of a third character that highlights the layers of text that obscure Walker’s identity.
But the second and third parts of the novel, entitled “Summer” and “Fall” respectively, are written by Walker himself and edited by Freeman. It’s here that the narrative person-shifts take place; Walker, after finding himself stuck, follows Freeman’s advice: “By writing about myself in the first person, I had smothered myself and made myself invisible, had made it impossible for me to find the thing I was looking for. I needed to separate myself from myself.” Walker’s literary distance—within the context of these self-conscious sections—helps him look for himself in darkly tinged sexuality and self-revelation.
But this quest for identity is thwarted by Auster’s empty prose. Clichéd phrases, like “That’s the way I am. Life is too short for dawdling” and “What about me? Haven’t these days meant anything for you?” and “She taught me not to be afraid of myself anymore” leave Walker and his fellow characters trapped in two dimensions. This stands in opposition, however, to the time and space Walker traverses—in such a multilayered, diligently designed novel, clichés seem strangely out of place. Perhaps, then, their presence is meant to highlight the futility of Walker’s quest for identity: can words and letters encompass the self? The soul? “Invisible” seems to suggest that they cannot, for at the novel’s end, Walker is flat and therefore fleeting, and a style that mirrors structure doesn’t excuse Auster’s seemingly lazy language.
More than that, however, the novel remains plot-oriented; words are at the service of furthering the plot and not artistry. Vladimir Nabokov once wrote that a major writer is simultaneously a storyteller, teacher, and enchanter, and though Auster has the first two mastered— Auster can weave intricate tales that span decades and miles—he is only halfway to enchantment in “Invisible.” His fascinating dance between past and present helps him approach this ideal, but “Invisible” has no moments of literary magic, or of any real beauty. And it’s not because the words themselves are simple, but instead because they are used so formulaically, without experiment. There is plot, there is description—but there is no poetry; and so the novel itself, like Walker, melts away.
This melting, however, doesn’t obscure the fact that Auster is a master of crafting intricate tales within tales. His novels are supremely readable and enticing. But even though his characters search for identity, like Walker in “Invisible,” they remain just that—invisible. Like Courbet, Auster has managed to create a work of art out of the awareness of tradition. He just never manages to break from it.

“The artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality,” John F. Kennedy ’40 said of Robert Frost in a speech following the poet’s death, “becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an officious state.” Horacio Castellanos Moya emerges as another writer who recognizes the discrepancies between his ideal and the reality and uses his talents to critically assess the forces responsible for the latter. In “The She-Devil in the Mirror,” the second of his novels to be translated into English by Katherine Silver, Moya continues in the tone he cultivated in the first of his translated books, “Senselessness,” filtering his condemnation of post-Salvadoran Civil War politics through the paranoid consciousness of his schizophrenic narrator.
Moya’s novel is a critique of the hunger for power that seized the Salvadorian political landscape in the early 1990s. Moya’s use of a compromised narrator lends his representation of these powers a disturbing air, a feeling that the governing entities were so corrupt that only someone completely out of touch with normalcy could imagine the mere possibility of such wrongdoing.  The novel leaves behind a sense of injustice that resonates well beyond the incidents of his characters and brings to light a story of crime outright that has long been overlooked.
“The She-Devil in the Mirror” opens with the narrator, Laura Rivera, lamenting the murder of her best friend, Olga María. The mystery behind Olga María’s murder quickly unfolds and becomes intertwined with the political demise of an aspiring anti-communist presidential candidate. Rivera’s paranoia driven, stream-of-consciousness attempt to resolve the murder of her dearest friend conjures labyrinths of political schemes, unmasking  the real chaotic networks of power  behind the evil that dominates her country.
The novel moves through the mystery by way of Rivera’s disjointed thoughts. At her friend’s wake, Rivera is strangely distracted, her paranoid fits seized briefly by flashes of the mundane and pathetic around her. “Those sons of bitches,” thinks Rivera, “those cowards, they should all be killed. Doesn’t her hair look great?” Her thoughts bound from the invisible killers to the way her friend has been made up by the funeral home. But as Rivera’s personal investigation into Olga María’s murder progresses, her thoughts gain a more narrow urgency. Rivera’s postulations span entire pages, as she weaves possible explanations for what has occurred, evoking the terror and despair of El Salvador in the wake of violence.
“I thought I knew her, but now I realize she had many personalities.” As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear that it is Rivera who possesses multiple personalities. While investigating her friend’s murder, Rivera ends up stealing her friend’s life by sleeping with each of her former lovers. “As if remembering Olga María had injected us with renewed passion, something delicious, something I’ve never felt before.” Rivera’s increasingly sick obsession with her friend’s trysts coincides with the deepening psychological downturn that allows her to formulate political theories and presumed exposés of evil. The more Rivera’s psychological state deteriorates, the more elaborate her theories become; however, amidst the nonsense and rants that Rivera produces, it becomes horrifyingly apparent that her theories are actually  truths, as if only an irrational mind could grasp the illogical nature of the what occurred in real-world San Salvador.
“In other cities,” posits Rivera, “you live on one side and the bad guys live on the other, and there’s miles in between, which is how it should be. But in this country, everything’s all squished together.” As the mystery surrounding Olga María’s murder grows more complex, this declaration becomes terrifyingly true. The people Rivera once thought to be Olga María’s friends and protectors are cast as potential murder suspects. Trusted political figures are grouped together with drug traffickers and terrorists, conspirators who found political interest in the cold-blooded murder of a young mother. In Rivera’s mind, the official murder investigation itself becomes a means of framing one figure or another, the city’s investigator being a criminal just as awful as the original murderers. Though at first Rivera’s conspiracy theories may seem unfounded, as the novel progresses the truth behind her ideas begins to emerge, and the reader’s thoughts regarding the other inhabitants of San Salvador begin to mirror hers.
Moya uses the cloud of suspicion that surrounds Olga María’s murder to illustrate the extent of the corruption in San Salvador as a microcosm of humanity at large and how even the perpetrators of heinous acts can gain impunity with enough power behind them. Rivera’s paranoia and frustration surrounding her friend’s murder only grow as she realizes there is no one above suspicion.
“The She-Devil in the Mirror” can sometimes become convoluted by Rivera’s disjointed thoughts and seemingly incoherent digressions, but this haziness eventually comes to highlight the distressing and straightforward condemnation that stems from Rivera’s never ceasing obsession. Each time she develops a new theory regarding Olga María’s death, a seemingly innocuous member of society is implicated and a new, authentic layer of wrongdoing is exposed.
Moya artfully uses Rivera’s mind to depict the chaotic and corrupt nature of the Salvadoran political landscape without the hampering effect of explication, allowing his work and powerful charge to resound not only San Salvador, but wherever political corruption may be.

“Our concern with history… is a concern with preformed images already imprinted on our brains, images at which we keep staring while the truth lies elsewhere, away from it all, somewhere as yet undiscovered.” Transcending these images is a dangerous prospect. By staring beyond the stills of history, we risk destabilising not only our ideas about the past but also our own place within that narrative. Despite this, W.G. Sebald’s “Austerlitz” stages such a staring contest, in which we—along with the protagonist—are challenged not to look away when those images dissolve, as devastating as the truth might turn out to be.
The novel follows Jacques Austerlitz, an architectural historian who sets out to uncover his origins and early childhood—a curious void in his memory—after suffering a mental breakdown. His journey leads him to confront the dark heart of European history. In this, his final novel, author W.G. Sebald synthesizes multiple literary genres: “Austerlitz” is at once autobiography, history, travelogue, and meditation. It’s publication in 2001—mere months before his death in a car accident—echoed the sentiment of closure, or the struggle for some semblance thereof, after a century of bloodshed and horror in Europe.
The book is structured around the encounters between an elusive narrator and Austerlitz, to whom Austerlitz tells his story in instalments, “speaking not so much to me as to himself,” says the narrator. So marginal is the narrator’s presence in the text that his voice is absorbed by his interlocutor’s story, which is reported without quotation marks, so that the two figures become virtually indistinguishable over the course of the narrative. Their chance meetings—in a Belgian cafe, on a ferry crossing the English Channel, in a London hotel bar—are marked by an eerie sense of inevitability: “our paths kept crossing,” says the narrator, “in a way that I still find hard to understand.”
These meetings, and the scenes of Austerlitz’s story, often take place at twilight, or to use Sebald’s favourite phrase, in “the gathering dusk.” We are reminded of Henry James’s preference for that time in the day when shadows begin to lengthen—what he called “the divine dusk.” But while for James this atmosphere was one in which history glimmered, offering up its inspiration, for Sebald, the impending darkness serves as a metaphor for the inscrutability of the past and the impossibility of self-knowledge. The narrator first realises this during his visit to the Breendonk fortress in Belgium, which was transformed into a concentration camp by the Nazis: “The darkness does not lift but becomes yet heavier as I think how little we can hold in mind, how everything is constantly lapsing into oblivion with every extinguished life, how the world is, as it were, draining itself, in that the history of countless places and objects which themselves have no power of memory is never heard, never described or passed on.”
Sebald’s response to this philosophical proposition is at once local, in telling the story of one man’s struggle to prevent his own history from “lapsing into oblivion,” and metaphysical, in challenging our assumptions about the linear nature of time. Perhaps, says Austerlitz, “all the moments of time have co-existed simultaneously… past events have not yet occurred but are waiting to do so at the moment when we think of them.”
But if past events are to be as present now to us as they once were, Austerlitz discovers, we must also apprehend the sufferings of those who have lived before us. And while his own sense of personal integrity depends urgently upon this historical exercise, it engenders, paradoxically, “disintegration of the personality.”
It is against this background that Austerlitz realizes “that all my life had been a constant process of obliteration, a turning away from myself and the world,” and undergoes his journey through Europe: travelling from the Czech Republic to England via Germany by train, tracing the route of the Kinder-transport which spirited him from Prague as a five-year old boy in 1939. After learning that his mother was interred at a camp in Terezín in 1942, he visits the town’s Ghetto Museum, and is henceforth tormented by images of “the bricks of the fortification walls… the endless lists of names… the grass growing between the cobblestones.”
From the moment we learn that Austerlitz was evacuated to England, the Holocaust haunts almost every page of the novel, but the novel never lapses into hysteria. This is partly attributable to Sebald’s deliberate prose style—described by critic James Wood as “densely agitated”—which renders even the most psychologically disordered states with forensic lucidity: “reason was powerless against the sense of rejection and annihilation which I had always suppressed, and which was now breaking through the walls of its confinement,” says Austerlitz, describing his most serious breakdown.
Moreover, the genocide in which we presume Austerlitz’s mother was murdered (this is never stated explicitly) is manifest in the fragments of evidence that Austerlitz finds in archives and books, and in the unattributed photographs that punctuate the pages of the novel. This is clearest towards the book’s end, in an extended description of a film made by the Nazis on the occasion of the Red Cross’s inspection of Theresienstadt in 1944, mendaciously depicting the prisoners of the camp enjoying life in what resembles a holiday resort. Austerlitz slows the film down, and attempts—unsuccessfully—to identify his mother among the groups of prisoners. It is the muteness of these historical documents—the disparity between their silence and the horror which they record—that induces psychological torpor in Austerlitz, and allow us, as readers, to comprehend the meaning of his trauma.
Shortly after “Austerlitz” was published, Sebald died in a car crash, aged 57. At the time, he was tipped to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in recognition of his literary achievements, including the meditative travelogue “The Rings of Saturn,” and “The Emigrants,” which tells the story of four individuals who—like Austerlitz—managed to escape the Holocaust but were forever haunted by the fate of those who did not.
But while “Austerlitz” shares these works’ fixation on uncovering the histories of forgotten people and places, its odyssey is a darker, more troubling one, and its construction more deliberate. The novel is preoccupied with the line that separates being from non-being, a line that blurs and trembles when we realize the contingency of our present existence on the now-invisible events of the past. For this reason, it is tempting to read “Austerlitz” as Sebald’s swan song, haunted, as it is, by one man’s apprehension of the inevitable obliteration of all things by time. But it is more certainly his masterpiece.

A. Ryan Leslie ’98 has a romantic streak that sets him apart from the rest of the modern R&B world—this Harvard grad knows how to treat the ladies. Unfortunately, the producer-turned-performer’s latest release, “Transitions,” is sleek and uninspired, relying on common tropes and clichés in order to appeal to a mass audience and mask its subpar vocals. While the album remains relatively listenable, Leslie’s attempts to create common ground render his songs false and hollow.
Leslie’s story is far less clichéd than his music. A Government concentrator and member of the Krokodiloes, he graduated from Harvard at the tender age of 19 and delivered the Harvard Oration during commencement. Soon thereafter he found his way into music production. He’s produced for Beyoncé, Britney Spears, and most recently Cassie, whose single “Me & U”—written and produced by Leslie—reached #1 on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Leslie is a master of marketing, harnessing the power of YouTube, Twitter, and MySpace to create an expansive fan base; he offers free iPods, backstage passes, and dinners as prizes to his Twitter followers.
But in 2005 Leslie turned toward performance, recording a debut album entitled “Just Right” that was only released in Europe. His self-titled second attempt, released earlier this year, was met with mixed reviews; critics simultaneously extolled his sweet melodies and electronic rhythms while mocking his generic lyrics.
His second album this year, “Transitions,” is hardly a change—if anything, the album shows not growth but regression; Leslie’s tracks seem emptier and more unimaginative. The opening of “You’re Not My Girl,” for example, mimcs the bass line on Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust,” making use of an almost identical rhythmic structure. The song is more than unoriginal, however; it feels sparse and cheap, a sense that arises from Leslie’s lack of bass or resonance, which in turn makes his songs seem filtered and light.
And though these melodies may be sweet, Leslie isn’t a vocalist. He hits the notes, yes, and even slips into falsetto on occasion, but with his lack of variation in volume and tone, he can’t compare to modern R&B greats like Usher and John Legend. In “Never Gonna Break Up,” the first track, Leslie makes evident these weaknesses. The chorus is sung nearly an octave higher than the verses, in a breathy falsetto, but his voice is merely pleasant and its intensity remains stagnant. “Never Gonna Break Up,” however, is polished, and showcasing Leslie’s skills as a producer. The phrases are expertly timed and coordinated; everything seems diligently planned. But this adds less then it subtracts, since it makes the album seem a little too deliberate, a little too produced, a little too disingenuous.
The albums few strengths are found in its rythms, which are at times intricate, like at the start of fourth track “Is it Real Love.” “Where did you come from / where have you been?” sings Leslie, opening with a triplet and ascending gracefully in eighth notes. And in Pusha T’s opening rap phrase on “Something That I Like,” the rhythmic structure leads to an intriguing enjambment: “Silly me, now I’m so into her / fashion.” Such a line break adds clever detail.
The generic lyrics, however, overshadow the occasional rhythmic flourish. At times, Leslie’s phrases are nearly laughable. “What’s your zodiac sign?” he sings on “Zodiac.” “Are we compatible, baby? / If it matches with mine / we should think about dating.” A few songs later, in “Sunday Night,” he describes his sexual exploits on Sunday evenings: “Do you know what today is? / It’s our anniversary... Work so hard for you / Now it’s time you reimburse me.” Lame jokes and awkward cockiness emphasize his lack of authenticity and inspiration.
This void suggests precisely what it is that Leslie lacks: spirit. Leslie’s lackluster vocals and simplistic lyrics overshadow his few rhythmic intricacies. His tracks seem void of real thought, relying on a mixture of various clichés and repetitive electronic backdrops. And though “Transitions” isn’t necessarily a complete failure—his songs are listenable, indeed—it lacks substantive value, and it cheapens the notion of romance by reducing it to a set of false-sounding phrases. Leslie’s previous songwriting and producing successes have failed to translate into his newest role. He may have found success coupled with Beyoncé or Cassie, but alone, he flounders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Steven Morrissey—although 50 years old and no longer bearing the sharp chin and product-heavy ’80s hairdo—continues to be exceptionlly prolific, having issued nine solo albums since the disbanding of The Smiths in 1987. “Swords,” the second Morrissey album released this year, is a compilation of 18 B-sides off singles from “You Are the Quarry” (2004), “Ringleader of the Tormentors” (2006), and last February’s “Years of Refusal.” Like those albums and unlike Morrissey’s earlier solo works, which parted little musically from The Smiths, “Swords” goes beyond jangling guitars and charmingly unstable vocal intonations, instead choosing to entertain other interests.  And just as those albums were disappointing to those yearning for more of The Smiths or at least something exciting from their erstwhile frontman, “Swords” continues Morrissey’s downward spiral with an unwieldy collection of obvious throwaways.
In fact, the songs on “Swords” are so poor that the finest track is the one not penned by Morrissey. “Drive-In Saturday,” a live David Bowie cover, showcases Morrissey’s vocal talents even though it barely elaborates on the original. But with his bold, elongated proclamations, Morrissey—who once was the U.K. branch president of the New York Dolls fan club—at least does justice to his passion for ’70s glam-rock. Elsewhere, album closer “Because of My Poor Education” continues this trend, though in a less gratifying way, beginning with a retro melody on piano similar to an overblown version of Lou Reed’s glam-rock ballad “Satellite of Love.” Turgid drums further ruin the song, often slowing down with decorative thumps better suited for melodrama.
The rest of the songs vary in genre, but the overarching weakness of the album can be summarized in a single word: excessiveness. The opening track “Good Looking Man About Town” begins with a sharp electronic riff and falls into a disorderly mélange of bass-driven groove. “Ganglord” is dominated by incessant cymbals and mechanical echoing; underneath all the extras, the song is nothing but a piece of lackluster pop.
One of the tidier tracks is “Don’t Make Fun of Daddy’s Voice,” which first appeared as a B-side to the 2004 single “Let Me Love You.” Simple chord progressions on thick electric guitar begin the song and drop out during the verses, leaving a very simple bass line to take over. During the chorus, the guitar carries out one-noted solos with an inharmonious female voice in the back, creating a Pixies-esque mood. And yet, the song is so basic and predictable that it bears likeness to an edgy children’s ditty.
“My Life Is a Succession of People Saying Goodbye”—the track most recalling The Smiths with its jangly Johnny Marr guitar—highlights Morrissey’s idiosyncratic singing until a harp budges in and confuses the mood. The depressive lyrics hit a little too close to home, as Morrissey seems somewhat conscious of his own recent mediocrity: “At one time the future / Did stretch out before me / But now / It stretched behind.”
Even his grand forte as a lyricist has diminished. His Smiths lyrics had been naturally witty with quirky details scattered like confetti, but still managed to brush on the most sincere and melancholic topics like love and disappointment. These skills have persisted in his solo albums, although he has lost much of his wit and he occasionally comes off like an inarticulate confessional poet. In “The Never-Played Symphonies,” Morrissey sings, “You were one / You meant to be one / And you jumped into my face / And kissed me on the cheek / And then were gone.” This track, indicative of a prevalent flaw on “Swords,” reveals Morrissey scraping the barrel for ideas, at times even settling with utter triteness.
Stretched over two decades, Morrissey’s solo career has been a mix of disappointment and relief—disappointment because he failed to go beyond his work with The Smiths, relief because his music still bore some indications of talent that helped make The Smiths one of the greatest British bands of the 1980s. “Swords,” however, contains only the disappointing aspects, too disappointing to even make it to the studio albums. It seems as though Morrissey has employed every single instrument and producing effect to cover up the nauseating mediocrity of the songs. Instead, they do nothing but highlight it.

Imagine for a moment that on the lonely Friday night depicted in the Strokes’ 2003 single “12:51,” frontman Julian Casablancas decided to hit up a dance club rather than crash the drunken house party mentioned in the lyrics. The result would sound something like “11th Dimension,” the first single from Casablancas’ premiere solo album “Phrazes For the Young.” Featuring a bubbling electronic beat layered with disco sheen and synths torn from the Human League’s new wave cornerstone “Don’t You Want Me,” “11th Dimension” does not resemble anything ever produced by the Strokes, which reflects the larger point of Casablancas’ solo album. With his band, Casablancas produced tight, punk-tinged garage pop; on his own, Casablancas clearly has greater ambitions and a more varied, chameleonic style, a fact that comes through on “Phrazes,” albeit with mixed results.
Unfortunately, a nearly four-year studio hiatus seems to have somewhat dulled Casablancas’ previously superb songwriting abilities. The album’s opener, “Out of the Blue,” rides a driving guitar riff resembling something from a punk rock Johnny Cash as Casablancas delivers one of the album’s best lyrics: “I know I’m going to hell in a leather jacket / at least I’ll be in another world while you’re pissing on my casket.” While Casablancas’ freewheeling tone adds a sense of fun not heard in his voice for several years, it doesn’t distract from the fact that the song never really moves anywhere. The same hook repeats for five minutes, without any substantial increase in excitement or drama.
The same principle holds true for “River of Breaklights,” in which Casablancas mindlessly chants, “Getting the hang of it, timing is everything,” over a generic, messy background of drums and guitar. Casablancas holds to the false impression on “Phrazes” that a fast tempo alone always conveys a sense of urgency or energy. He fell victim to similar problems on his later Strokes songwriting—think “Juicebox”—and has failed to correct such issues. “Brakelights” does not offer any compelling musical ideas with the exception of a breakdown with computer-generated blips reminiscent of the Super Mario Bros. soundtrack.
The uninspired “Glass” recalls “On the Other Side” from the Strokes’ 2006 release “First Impressions of Earth” with a syncopated beat and slowly progressing guitar chords. As Casablancas wails muddled lyrics such as, “I don’t believe it / I won’t believe it,” his usually appealing nasal, alien-sounding baritone starts to strain, proving that he truly sounds better as a singer at faster tempos.
It is in the moments that Casablancas breaks free of midtempo rock and experiments with his sound that “Phrazes” truly shines. “11th Dimension” is undoubtedly the finest track on the album: an ’80s new-wave homage recalling the post-punk roots of New Order, “Dimension” showcases Casablancas truly having fun, as he gleefully exclaims “I got music coming out of my hands and feet!” Similarly experimental, the bluesy “4 Chords Of The Apocalypse” opens as a keyboard-fueled shuffle before devolving into a grungy rave-up in the chorus with Casablancas shredding his vocal chords over churning twin-guitar solos. The closer “Tourist” resembles the Led Zeppelin classic “Kashmir,” featuring its galloping drumbeat and Middle Eastern-sounding, snake charming guitar lines that rhythmically shift to accomadate the addition of space age synths. Casablancas’ experimental instincts add a much-needed dose of variety to the album, seeing as many of his other tracks end up sounding like weak Strokes B-sides.
Casablancas’ lyrics work best when he embraces his appointed role as a lovable indie rock miscreant, guilty of overindulgence and carelessness. The excellent “Left & Right in the Dark” incorporates hand claps and a shimmering synth melody into his vocals about not knowing his way in the world: “I’m on my way, oh somewhere / Feels like I’m going left and right in the dark.” He brings a familiar tone of an unapologetic malcontent to “Ludlow Street,” which features a bizarre sitar introduction before transitioning into a boozy, demented waltz. Over a skipping drum machine and pleasant guitar strumming, Casablancas’ wistfully praises common street musicians while condemning the “yuppie expansion.” “Everything seems to go wrong once I stop drinking,” he bashfully declares at the song’s opening. He’s one of the decade’s finest punk rock ne’er-do-wells, and his music reaches its maximum potential when he embraces this role rather than rejecting it.
Casablancas’ solo debut is a confusing experience. Despite running 40 minutes, “Phrazes” is a mere eight tracks. Consequently, the album feels too short while most of the tracks feel too long. His output is erratic: “11th Dimension” and “Left and Right in the Dark” stand among his finest work, while the rest of “Phrazes” suffers from a lack of creative inspiration. Casablancas’ solo effort proves that the Strokes truly were greater than the sum of their parts. For now, as the Strokes record their next album, “Phrazes” is a decent placefiller, but certainly not an enduring, compelling masterpiece in its own right.

For years now there has been an interesting subset of the umbrella genre indie music: alt-country. The genre has always been removed from stereotypically indie values, favoring straight-forward rock, old-fashioned Southern Gothic lyrics, and country values as worn as the grooves on any Southern man’s first Lynyrd Skynyrd vinyl. Whereas other traditional genres are revamped and stylized in the indie world, alt-country has remained unwaveringly loyal to its roots. Molina & Johnson’s self-titled debut album squarely fits the mold of this genre, providing candid, authentically American songs. However, what the album gains in its masterful portrayal of classic Americana, it loses in musical originality and complexity.
Molina & Johnson is the collaboration of alt-country legends Will Johnson of Centro-Matic and Jason Molina of Songs: Ohia and The Magnolia Electric Co. In the tradition of many classic country and blues albums, the self-titled release is sparsely orchestrated, contributing to the feeling that it was created by two talented and mournful men kicking back, imbibing, loading shotguns, and playing music.
This spare, minimalist approach to the music creates a bare, autumnal album that’s at once soothing, depressing and—unfortunately—less than gripping. Johnson’s husky growl reverberates around Molina’s baleful, tremulous cry and the two voices combine to nice effect, presenting two different sides to the classic American man: bruised and tough, soulful and exposed. The duo exhibits an effortless mastery of many classic tropes, employed without pretense to keep the album engaging and honest. Unfortunately the album’s traditional song structures and generally unremarkable music cause the songs to run together, and, at times, it feels like Molina & Johnson are playing the same song with small variations over and over again.
Many of the tracks are more blues than they are country. “All Gone, All Gone,” is about as dismal as the title would suggest. It features a duet between Johnson and Texas songsmith Sarah Jaffe over a plodding guitar line that sounds as if it’s plucked from an early Robert Johnson recording. Featuring a singing saw—an instrument whose existence is easy to forget, but whose presence is impossible to ignore—the song feels like a slow drive down a pitch-black southern road in the heart of autumn. It’s hauntingly beautiful and the traditional sounds it employs are not often heard in modern music.
Molina & Johnson struggle with the limitations of their chosen genre, however, occasionally exhausting their limited supply of musical and thematic tropes. Indicative of the album’s primary shortcoming, “In the Avalon/Little Killer” is a maudlin piano ballad that falls short of the powerful simplicity that “All Gone, All Gone” achieves, and for which it strives. While emotive and marginally moving, the music is fairly boring, never quite leaving the ground. It is chilling, but only slightly so, and while it maintains the unmediated feeling of someone sitting down and heedlessly expressing their emotions over a few simple chords, this self-indulgent approach to songwriting can make for a boring listen.
Eschewing the simplistic, traditional structure of their other songs, the more uptempo “Almost Let You In” resists the stagnation with which the rest of the album flirts, and is one of the record’s better tracks. “Almost Let You In” features a comparatively complex and propulsive guitar melody. However, the addition of a distorted single-note piano line that glides like a phantom and the far-off stomp of the drums is what truly makes the song. The number also highlights the strength of the vocalists both on their individual verses and the tightly coiled haunt of their lush harmonies. Easily the most stirring on the album, “Almost Let You In” maintains the melancholic, genuine feel of the entire record while adding more complex and modern elements that serve as a welcome respite from the duller aspects that are pervasive throughout the album.
While “Almost Let You In” shows Molina & Johnson pushing their genre to pleasant effect, the tracks that stay comfortably within the genre and play it with an authentic familiarity have just as much merit. Songs like “Twenty Cycles to the Ground” and “Each Star Marks a Day,” while doing nothing to transcend or reinvigorate the genre, are a testament to the preeminent mastery of alt-country exhibited by Molina & Johnson.
In Molina & Johnson’s melancholic strums of acoustic guitar, there are generations of American songwriters and miles of frontier. Both singers have explored a similar fascination with American themes in their other bands. Here, these traditional themes and sounds are omnipresent, and something about Molina & Johnson’s minimalist approach makes them feel better developed. Many similarly spare acts craft their natural sounds. They record separate tracks for fretboard squeaks, chair cricks, and the sound of a thumb dully thumping against the guitar’s body. Here, the sounds feel like natural parts of the recording. You can almost hear the whiskey being poured in between takes, and this honest and authentic quality makes the album.

Weezer used to be geek rock titans, singing charming love songs over mellow California-pop melodies. Their self-titled debut and sophomore album “Pinkerton” eschewed the oft gloom-ridden nature of early ’90s grunge and pop rock. In the years since, Weezer has released a series of disappointing albums that have driven the band more toward a radio pop direction. Their latest album, “Raditude” is the current apex of that progression. Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo ’99-’06 is notorious for his love of pop culture, referencing bands and pop icons from the Beatles to Green Day in his previous work. With “Raditude,” Weezer takes that love of everything pop one step further, enlisting major pop song writers such as Jermaine Dupri and Dr. Luke—the man behind Miley Cyrus’ chart-topping “Party in the U.S.A.”—to add to the band’s pop sensibilities, and unabashedly mimicking easily recognizable musical elements of the past decade’s well known radio hits.
While Weezer echoes the Top 40 on “Raditude,” they maintain the quirks they are best known for and integrate them into the one dimensional composition of the songs. The album’s openers, “(If You’re Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To” and “I’m You’re Daddy,” are the two most Weezer-esque songs on the album, hearkening back to the band’s early career. “I Want You To” is a power-pop gem that mimics the rhythmic and schematic elements of Fall Out Boy’s “Dance, Dance.” Weezer takes a simple melody, adds power chords, and makes the song their own by substituting basic drum interludes with rhythms created by acoustic guitars and adding in the cheesy vocal harmonies that drew fans to the group years ago.
“I’m You’re Daddy,” co-written by Dr. Luke and Cuomo, continues the power-pop theme of the album’s opener. Combining synthesizers and mechanical beats with the high energy guitar creates a more prevalent pop sound which nearly masks such ridiculous rhymes such as “I will egg the goomba / If you tire / Try my best to moonwalk / On a wire.”
“Raditude” also includes elements of mainstream pop to which Weezer has not even attempted to attain in the past, the results of which are largely unfortunate. One of the most anticipated songs on the album is “Can’t Stop Partying,” co-written by Jermaine Dupri and featuring a rap solo by one of the hip-hop world’s most recognizable figures, Lil’ Wayne. Weezer takes a shot at dance-pop, using the cliché R&B babes and booze formula: “I gotta have Patron / I gotta have the beat / I gotta have a lot of pretty girls around me.” Lil’ Wayne puts the absurdity of the song best in his interlude: “Okay bitch it’s Weezer and it’s Weezy / upside-down MTV.” Musically, “Can’t Stop Partying,” an adaptation from an acoustic demo off of Cuomo’s solo album, sounds like a Lady Gaga B-side. The song is filled with overdubbing, drum machine beats, and synthesizer-based melodies that sound only a few notes different from Lady Gaga’s early 2009 hit “Poker Face,” which Weezer covered in concert earlier this year.
Other songs like “Put Me Back Together” and “I Don’t Want to Let You Go” take on emotional themes in the way only the most saccharine of pop songs can. The band slows down the tempo and Cuomo sings with a whiney twinge to his voice, as if trying to emulate the style of the “Put Me Back Together” co-writers Tyson Ritter and Nick Wheeler of The All-American Rejects. “I Don’t Want to Let You Go” sounds uncannily similar to Hoobastank’s 2003 hit “The Reason,” relying on a simple piano melody and slowly heightening vocal theme to convince an unnamed woman not to leave the singer. On “Put me Back Together,” Cuomo sings “I’m alone in my room / I don’t know what to do,” an image so stereotypical in such music that it is made tolerable only by Weezer’s unapologetic evocation of it.
The over-the-top nature of “Raditude” undermines any attempts Weezer makes at deviating from their new-found direction. “Love is the Answer” is a failed attempt at semi-serious themes, embodied in lyrics such as “There will come a day / When we transcend our pain,” which seems out of place on an album of stories filled with teenage drama (cf. “The Girl Got Hot,” “In the Mall”).
The draw of “Raditude” is Weezer’s willingness not to hold back or make excuses for their drive toward predictable pop songs. Cuomo and crew present themselves with the challenge of taking their pop sensibilities even further, a challenge which will surely scare away any remaining members of the “Pinkerton” cult.

Something is always lost when a book is adapted for the screen, but rarely is that something all semblance of entertainment value. Ostensibly constructed from the research into CIA psychic programs recounted by Jon Ronson in his book of the same name, “The Men Who Stare At Goats” is an attempted comedy and would-be political satire that fails on just about every conceivable level. For Ronson, a factual foray into the paranoia and government-funded absurdities of the Cold War era made for excellent non-fiction fodder. Presented as a film with one-note characters and only the barest discernible plot, the material is, to put it charitably, less engaging.
Judged purely on its script’s coherence and the water-treading performances of its A-List cast, “The Men Who Stare At Goats” might just have easily been titled, “I’m An Oscar-Nominated Actor—Get Me Out Of Here!” Clocking in at a merciful 93 minutes, the film features George Clooney desperately attempting to spin screenplay straw into gold as Lyn Cassady, retired psychic operative of the United States’ “New Earth Army,” a division of the military trained to harness the power of the mind in combat. Ewan McGregor—whose role in “Revenge of the Sith,” another comedy about mental powers, no doubt prepared him for this one—plays Bob Wilton, the reporter who ill-advisedly tags along with Clooney into American-occupied Iraq. Rounding out our star-studded ensemble is Kevin Spacey as Larry Hooper, Cassady’s rival from their training days, in what is essentially a cameo role.
What is Cassady’s secret mission in Iraq? Does he really have psychic powers? What does the film have to say about modern America’s involvement in the Middle East? Alas, this movie is not the place to find answers to these questions, or pretty much any of the others posed by its premise. Answers would imply it is in the business of making sense, which it decidedly is not. There is a pretense of political parable—an honest Iraqi who shelters our heroes, a stereotypical condescending American contractor preparing to exploit a country whose people he cares little about—but it’s a series of aimless clichés that don’t even add up to a clichéd conclusion.
Clooney, with an assist from a hippie hairdo (sported in flashbacks), tries admirably to save an unsalvageable script. But he can only play the enigmatic “is he psychic, is he not” card so many times before audience members realize that the film has punted on the question entirely. McGregor delivers all his lines in monotone and does an impressive job at repelling any attempt at empathizing with his character. It is unclear why Kevin Spacey was needed at all for this production when an extra off the Hollywood strip could have delivered his seven or so lines just as well, and for a fraction of the price. And Jeff Bridges—who most forget was also an Oscar nominee for “The Contender”—is just painful as Clooney’s drugged-out mentor, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django. The use of the actors’ names here and not those of their characters is more than mere convention; the people who inhabit “The Men Who Stare at Goats” are so simplistic that there is no chance of the actors becoming subsumed in their roles—Clooney is clearly Clooney, McGregor is McGregor, and Spacey remains Spacey.
Scenery in the movie consists of a hotel room, a desert, and a car. Also, a cave. The soundtrack, like the storyline and Grant Heslow’s direction, is forgettable, consisting of predictable tone music and a single use of “More Than a Feeling.” To be fair, the film does have several good lines (Clooney to a fleeing Iraqi, before hitting him with a car: “It’s okay, we’re Americans—we’re here to help you!”), delivered with the comedic skill one would expect from its cast when handed serviceable material. Thankfully, these moments are all available in the movie’s trailer, saving viewers a valuable 90 minutes of runtime.
It is a strange time for the movies when the cleverest cultural commentary of recent memory was put out by Ben Stiller (“Tropic Thunder”) and the trippiest, most nonsensical film of 2009 stars George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, and Kevin Spacey. Ultimately, “The Men Who Stare At Goats” is a monumental waste of talent, employing A-List actors in the cinematic equivalent of the “no soap radio” gag. It is a prank without a punch line, a satire without a point, a joke at which we are supposed to laugh because we don’t want to be caught as the only one to say we didn’t get it. Don’t fall for it.

Though released just a week shy of Halloween, Robert Zemeckis’ beautifully animated “A Christmas Carol” proves itself the perfect ghost story for any season. With nuanced performances, a strong visual aesthetic, and an expertly pitched pace, Zemeckis’ third experiment in motion capture animation proves to be his best yet. Though the film offers little by way of narrative invention and may frighten much of its intended audience, its truly spectacular 3-D effects and loyalty to Dickens’ novella will likely preserve it as a new Christmas classic.
Though many films in the past decade have explored the depths afforded by recent innovations in 3-D technology, none look quite so spectacular as “A Christmas Carol.” From the snowflakes which seem to hover just inches from the viewer’s face to the eerily protruding nose of the unscrupulous Scrooge (Jim Carrey), Zemeckis’ effects add depth to the film without seeming gimmicky. Certain scenes in particular employ 3-D to unique and immersive effect—most notably Scrooge’s many modes of transportation. One of these involves a mobile room with an invisible floor; as the room zooms in and over London, tables and chairs lurching across the invisible expanse, Scrooge and his surroundings establish separate planes of depth that are utterly convincing.
The animation in the film is also breathtaking in both its realism and beauty. While characters in Zemeckis’ earlier motion capture films—such as the insufferable “The Polar Express”—were crippled by soulless eyes and blank, plastic faces, the figures in “A Christmas Carol” feel fully human while still retaining a measure of animated charm. Though scenes without supernatural entities are sometimes a little too dark to fully appreciate the detailed animation, especially while wearing the polarized 3-D glasses, the majority of the film is rich and vibrant in its depiction of the bustling streets of wintertime London and the surrounding countryside.
The use of motion capture also allows the cast members to dynamically play multiple roles. Carrey is perhaps the most effective in this way, playing not only Ebenezer Scrooge, but also the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. For Carrey to act as all three ghosts is a fitting and clever touch; rather than overwhelm the audience, this choice simply underscores the many ways in which the ghosts represent different facets of Scrooge’s personality. The multiplicity of roles also allows Carrey to stretch his comedic muscles. As the Ghost of Christmas Past—faithfully depicted as a sort of human candle—Carrey bends his face to produce myriad ticks as the flame wavers and crackles, adding a welcome measure of humor.
Not all performances are so strong; Gary Oldman’s turn as Marley’s Ghost, for instance, is wildly over the top, so much so that his wailings and moans are at times incomprehensible. But Oldman’s other roles in the film—Scrooge’s soft-spoken financial partner Bob Cratchit and his son, Tiny Tim—are surprisingly subtle, providing much of the heart of “A Christmas Carol.”
The film’s stylized aesthetic, along with the unfolding of the narrative, is tremendously faithful to Dickens’ tale and sure to please literary purists. In fact, nearly all of illustrator John Leech’s original paintings and woodcuts are closely recreated, making the film truly seem like the novella come to life. There are naturally some drawbacks to this somewhat slavish approach. Many scenes involving the ghosts are likely to frighten small children, and viewers hoping for a few narrative twists—like those in Zemeckis’ 2007 adaptation of “Beowulf”—will surely be disappointed. Nevertheless, for all those whose memories of “A Christmas Carol” center on the original classic rather than the Kermit the Frog or Mickey Mouse versions, Zemeckis’ film is a delightful and nostalgic experience.
Though some of their technical achievements seem dated in retrospect, both of Zemeckis’ previous motion capture films were praised at the time of their releases, wowing audiences with human characters who both looked and moved like live-action actors. And yet “Beowulf” and “The Polar Express” have ultimately proven forgettable because they never managed to connect emotionally with their audiences. “A Christmas Carol” manages to preserve the human heart at the core of Dickens’ tale without sacrificing the awesome powers of the digital technology on display—one early Christmas miracle that shouldn’t be taken for granted.

“American Casino” has no Michael Moore, Morgan Spurlock, or Al Gore. No lone protagonist sets out to lead and shape the viewer’s understanding of the subject matter. Instead, director Leslie Cockburn speaks only through others—financial experts, city officials, and an array of Baltimore residents—in order to explore and explain the causes and effects of the current financial crisis. Through its masterful compilation of interviews and news clips, the documentary deftly weaves the personal with the national and the human with the financial for a holistic and disturbing take on the sub-prime mortgage crisis.
Cockburn—a longtime investigative journalist and former Princeton professor—is no stranger to the compact and powerful exposé. While the subject matter of “American Casino” seems far removed from her many films about global atrocities in Asia, South America, and the Middle East, the impact is no less shocking. As the title indicates, Cockburn—along with her husband, Andrew, who co-wrote and co-produced the film—suggests that the deregulation of financial institutions turned Wall Street into a virtual casino, one that operates on stakes much higher than anything found on the Vegas strip. The film opens with the now familiar tale of unsupervised banking recklessness: banks steadily doled out an increasing number of subprime mortgages—loans made to consumers with bad credit. Many would then adjust the interest rates for select mortgages according to market fluctuations, demanding more and more payment from consumers unable to afford the escalating charges.
Beyond faulty economic theory and policy, the documentary also details how hundreds of billions of dollars clouded the judgments of banks, brokers, and insurance companies, encouraging the predatory processes that led to the economy’s ultimate collapse. While policy was made in Washington and the major financial players operated in New York City, American taxpayers bore the brunt of the downturn, losing their homes to foreclosure and repossession and being asked to bail out the institutions that devastated them in the first place.
The Cockburns’ most admirable accomplishment is in balancing the technical rigors of economic theory with focused, empathetic stories of struggle and pain. One such story belongs to Reverend Almalene “Emily” Wade, who took out the equity in her childhood home in order to make the renovations needed to accommodate an assisted-living center, but could not afford the monthly payments and so lost the residence. Standing in front of her former home, Wade speaks powerfully to the scope of her financial hardships. “You lose more than the home,” she explains. “You lose your identity, you lose your space, you lose your church, you lose your community, you lose your local friends...You lose everything.” Through juxtaposition of gritty financial details with tales of personal turmoil, the film renders the massive and technical complexity of the economic crisis real and palpable on an individual scale.
The Cockburns assemble a wide range of evidence, opinions, and information in piecing together the crisis from multiple angles. There is the former Wall Street employee who feels no responsibility, the government worker frustrated with having to deal with squatters on foreclosed property, and the membership of the St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center indignant that these lenders purposely offered their clients loans that they cannot afford. Despite a brisk pace and an ever-widening range of perspectives, the film’s various threads are often surprisingly connected beneath the surface, ensuring that the narrative never gets lost or jumbled despite its multitude of information.
However, because the Cockburns offer so many viewpoints, the film does not always provide enough sources when it comes to individual aspects of the financial crisis. For instance, when profiling one of the most controversial topics—financial companies like Wells Fargo allegedly targeting minority communities for subprime mortgages—the Cockburns rely on one unquestionably biased source: John Relman, a civil rights attorney involved in a lawsuit with Wells Fargo for minority targeting. Wells Fargo declined to comment and the film offers no rebuttal from anyone else, and the result feels a little one-sided.
“American Casino” accelerates with a systematic authority usually provided by a protagonist or a narrator. With this technique, the Cockburns outline how disturbingly far-reaching the consequences of the financial crisis—both direct and indirect—have become. High rates of foreclosure, repossession of property, and declarations of bankruptcy in minority communities lead to the increasing devastation of American neighborhoods, creating a thriving environment for crime and drugs. People then leave such neighborhoods in droves, draining the community’s equity and decreasing investors’ interest.
In mapping the wide and varied repercussions of the crisis, the film inevitably wanders at times. One of the most far-fetched segments comes from the assertion that as a result of economic hard times, the spike in the number of abandoned or unclean backyard pools has led to the dramatic rise of dangerous mosquitoes, rodents, and snakes. This facet of post-recession America, although argumentatively substantiated by Cockburn, does not have quite the same resonance as the film’s other angles. But despite its occasional flaws, “American Casino” is subtle in its delivery, serious in its examination, and undeniably illuminating in its exploration of the current economic situation and how it variously affects us.

Ah, the pains of adolescence. You live with your dorky mom, who aspires to make clothing out of beach towels and burlap. Your house is a geodesic dome, and your main source of nutrition is your mother’s popcorn balls. There is clearly only one way to cope, and that is to write fairly explicit science fiction about a futuristic mountain man named Bronco—think white suits and flying vehicles—in search of his lost gonads.
Admittedly, adolescence was and is awkward, full of poor fashion choices and bad school lunches, but even the diverse student body of Harvard—with their wealth of obscure interests and experiences—would probably find this description of their teen years a bit far-fetched. Though writer-director Jared Hess aims once more for the brand of oddball humor you might expect from previous films “Napoleon Dynamite” and “Nacho Libre,” the quirky characters of his new movie, “Gentlemen Broncos,” still ring false.
“Gentlemen Broncos” follows the same basic trajectory as “Napoleon Dynamite.” An insular, stammering kid, whose quirks far outnumber his friends, meets a couple of equally weird outcasts. He is forced to start living outside of his fantasy world and gains a modicum of acceptance for who he is in the process. The hero in question in “Gentlemen Broncos” is Benjamin Purvis, played by relative unknown Michael Angarano. Benjamin lives in a small Alaska town with his mother, and copes with the death of his father by immortalizing the “game warden and explorer” in his science-fiction trilogy, “Yeast Lords.”
Benjamin’s adventures begin when he signs up for Cletus Fest, the best young fantasy writers’ convention in the state. En route to the convention by schoolbus, he meets Tabatha (Halley Feiffer), just back from Belgium, who claims to write French mysteries about a stable hand named Pierre. Tabatha sees potential in “Yeast Lords,” and with the help of her friend Lonnie Donaho (Héctor Jiménez), who has a speech impediment, a bowl haircut, and most importantly, a production company, she decides to turn it into a low-budget film.
Acclaimed science-fiction writer Chevalier (Jermaine Clement, the stockier half of the “Flight of the Conchords” duo) also sees potential in “Yeast Lords.” Facing the end of his career, he receives the story as a submission for a writing contest and decides to publish it under his own name. Benjamin, feeling betrayed by both Tabatha and Chevalier, his idol, wanders aimlessly for a while until he finally decides to take a stand.
The movie is firmly rooted in a mythical past (the 1990s) full of sweaters and mom jeans, laminate tables, and a willful ignorance of a larger world outside of that which can be reached by car. It’s a kind of nostalgia for a nerd-kitsch Americana that would be more appropriate 20 years from now. This world is the same one that Hess captures in “Napoleon Dynamite,” only here he seems determined to test the limits of the weirdness of small-town America.
This involves substituting many of the charmingly quirky aspects of “Napoleon Dynamite” for things that are downright bizarre or simply gross. “Gentleman Broncos” contains a very healthy dose of bathroom humor; if projectile vomiting as a key plot point sounds like an excellent idea, this is probably the movie for you. This sense of humor is exemplified in a typical exchange between mother and child, as Benjamin protests to having to sell his mom’s popcorn “country balls”: “I’m not selling two balls in a sack.”
Most of the absurdity comes from the dialogue and props, while the acting remains deadpan. Clement, as Chevalier, recycles his character from “Flight of the Conchords” (which basically involves as little emotion as possible), simply adding feathers, weird leather ensembles, and an earpiece to become the science-fiction god. The rest of the actors follow suit, with the notable exception of indie veteran Jennifer Coolidge, who plays Benjamin’s bubbly, excitable mother. The unabating deadpan irony, when combined with the ludicrous plot, serve to estrange the characters from us rather than endearing them to us.
In “Napoleon Dynamite,” audiences were able to identify with the fear that comes from asking a girl to a school dance, or wanting to be popular, even if we don’t have a llama living in our backyard. It is much harder to connect with someone whose face betrays no feeling and whose prose includes lines like, “He’s the chosen one. He was born with flesh pockets.” By failing to give viewers a glimpse into its main character’s emotions, “Gentlemen Broncos” ends up feeling more like Benjamin’s clumsy science fiction than the work of a seasoned comedic director.

“Everybody assumes that to be a scientist or a mathematician requires thinking and problem solving and so on. But a lot of people assume the arts are just a matter of inspiration, or God giving you a message, or primarily about emotions,” says Howard E. Gardner, a former co-director and one of twelve Principal Investigators of Project Zero, a research group at the Graduate School of Education.
Founded by philosopher Nelson Goodman in 1967, Project Zero claims its mission is “to understand and enhance learning, thinking, and creativity in the arts, as well as humanistic and scientific disciplines.” In the aftermath of the success of the Soviet Sputnik space program, Americans focused on determining ways in which people in the scientific disciplines learned. Project Zero was created in response to this move to emphasize scientific instruction, which its founders felt unfairly ignored learning through the arts. The group’s name refers to Goodman’s belief that nothing—or “zero”—had then been established about how learning happens in the arts. Goodman accepted an offer to run Project Zero with the idea that it would combat assumptions about artistic practice and ameliorate the lack of rigor in cognitive investigations of arts education.
Many of the major ideas which emerged from Project Zero in its first two decades of existence were a result of its focus on the arts, which in turn greatly influenced the field of arts education. One of these theories, developed during the mid-1980s, is that of “teaching for understanding.” This idea draws on an inherent characteristic of the arts, as it suggests that individuals demonstrate true understanding of a concept only when they are able to put it into action. “It borrows the idea of performance from the arts. It says, ‘It’s not what you know, but what you can do with what you know,’” says Shari Tishman, the current Director of Project Zero.
These concepts began Project Zero’s transformation from what had been a primarily theoretical enterprise into a more applied, hands-on organization. “I guess my sense is that Project Zero has always been interested in that line between—the bridge between—theory and practice,” says Principal Investigator Mara Krechevsky.
More recently, this emphasis on application has grown to encompass many of the toughest questions in education today, both arts-related and not. Much of their current research, such as teaching children to understand complex causality, can be applied across a number of subjects. Principal Investigator Tina A. Grotzer provides an example of the latter: “Kids come into the cafeteria, and they talk a little louder to be heard over the person next to them…and pretty soon the lunch lady’s yelling at them. They’re all upset because it’s not their fault…their intentions are just to be heard,” she says.
Grotzer explains that this situation provides an analogy for the current state of climate change, which has escalated to a dangerous degree because of the cumulative effects of heedless individual actions.
“It’s taking those understandings that kids have today and helping them live better in the world they’re going to live in tomorrow,” she says.
Though Project Zero has broadened its scope significantly in recent years, it has not lost sight of its roots in the arts and how arts-oriented programs can contribute to improving the future, specifically that of education.
“I’m personally very interested in looking at how art can help young people understand the power of thinking,” says Tishman, the Principal Investigator of Artful Thinking. Artful Thinking was developed to help teachers integrate art into the classroom, and to use analytical thinking about art to encourage similar ways of thinking in other subjects. The “Artful Thinking Palette,” which includes concepts such as “reasoning,” “comparing” and “finding complexity,” suggests a number of aspects of thinking which art may help cultivate.
According to Gardner, Project Zero is constantly looking ahead to the future of education. “We need to have entities that try to imagine what education could be like, instead of tinkering at the edges,” he says. The group’s progressive perspective has led it to identify globalization, the digital revolution, and the biological revolution (the rapidly changing understanding of how the brain functions), as three important points that will transform education for this generation of students.
“Clearly the digital revolution makes possible new media. In terms of Project Zero, one of the things we’ve learned from the digital revolution is that we can’t just think of canonical art forms—dance, theater; we have to think of other art forms that are arising because of digital possibilities,” Tishman says. “The digital revolution makes possible certain kinds of tools that provide opportunities to engage in the arts much more widely and in different ways.”
While the foundational focus on the arts has contributed to the formulation of its larger theories, ultimately the goal of Project Zero is to advance education as a whole.
“When you’re saying there is this whole bunch of things that people need to learn, and they need to learn them well, and all these diverse students need to be able to learn them well, it’s like trying to plant a field without having the seeds,” Grotzer says. “You have to know what to do to nourish them, to make them grow. Unless you know what to do on the ground, you aren’t going to change education.”

The intricately detailed, visceral, and abstract images on display in the Penthouse Gallery of the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH) until November 12 are reminiscent of the complex and convoluted inner workings of the human mind itself. The intensely personal process through which the artist, Kayla A. Escobedo ’12, created these works is the source of this effect and the defining characteristic of the exhibition.“I use my work as a way for me to figure out what’s going on in my life,” Escobedo says. “It’s my thinking process visualized. In the process of making the work, I can figure out how I’m dealing with situations.”Escobedo cites her tumultuous relationships with family members and her fear of death as two of the personal topics that she explores through myriad artistic mediums. Since beginning six years ago as a ceramicist, Escobedo has branched out into comics, painting, and film, while taking inspiration from literature and mythology.Escobedo’s exhibition at the SOCH Penthouse Gallery is the latest in a string of extensive contributions to the Harvard arts community. She is an illustrator for both Tuesday Magazine and the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Her artwork has also been featured in the Harvard Advocate and last year’s “Students Choose” exhibition in the Sert Gallery of the Carpenter Center.The student-curated SOCH Penthouse Gallery exhibition features a variety of mediums, including oil paintings, acrylics, ink drawings and film. Each of these art forms serves to convey the common themes of Escobedo’s examination of her family relationships and her exploration of death through the use of abstract shapes and symbols. The acrylic painting “Leda and the Swan,” inspired by the W.B. Yeats poem of the same title, is an intriguing conflagration of textures and shapes that arrest the eye with their unsettling imagery and piercing detail. Meanwhile, the eerie images of “Planting Railroad Spikes,” in which words mingle with abstract figures, verge upon the grotesque in a powerfully poignant elicitation of emotion.These personally symbolic, abstract renderings reach a pinnacle in the centerpiece of the exhibition, an oil on canvas diptych consisting of a portrait of the artist’s parents alongside a self-portrait.“It was my first big abstract endeavor,” says Escobedo of the diptych, which took about 50 hours to complete. “I was dealing with a lot of intense things with my family, so I wanted to work it out with this painting and try to figure out how I was handling it.” The diptych is a masterful amalgamation of abstract symbols used to represent the personalities of the artist and her parents, as well as the relationships between them. Distorted images of hands, the placement of the figures, and the colors employed in the two paintings all serve to metaphorically depict the three subjects and their interactions with the world around them.“I used hands to express my parents’ personalities and how they view the world,” Escobedo says. “My mother’s hands are big; they are reaching out to the world, because she grasps outwardly for things. My father is very internal and very rational, so all of his hands are fixated on the top portion of his abstract figure, which I think of as his head.”Escobedo’s use of hands in the diptych is one of the manifold layers of symbolism that saturate her artwork with emotional significance. Her skillful channeling of the abstract into textured, complex works of art allows her exploration of personal themes to resonate powerfully with the viewer.This profundity of emotion in the exhibition’s artwork can be cathartic for both artist and audience. “I’m still exploring and trying to find out how I deal with being alive,” Escobedo says. “I get all of this bad stuff out through my work so it doesn’t affect me in my day-to-day life.”

“This piece is...a little more surreal in context and performance,” Sanford Biggers, the 2009 Marshall S. Cogan Visiting Artist, says of his most recent exhibition  which opens in Memorial Hall today. An imaginative artist who experiments in many types of media, Biggers’ innovative and bizarre work has been shown in museums around the world, including the Tate Modern in London and the Whitney in New York. His 2007 piece, “Blossom,” is a 15-foot tall reconstruction of a tree whose trunk penetrates and supports a life-size piano; this oddity is characteristic of Biggers’ large installation pieces, which have touched on subjects ranging from the state of hip-hop to Eastern mysticism.
According to Biggers, his newest exhibition—comprised of “Constellation,” an installation on view until December 2, and “Stranger Fruit,” a performance piece which will be shown only once on November 18—was influenced by a combination of Chinese calligraphic painting, Japanese cherry blossom festivals, the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi, Negro spirituals, and cosmology. This creation was commissioned by the Public Art Program, a sector of the Harvard Office for the Arts.
“Constellation” features a bare tree draped with an antebellum American quilt, surrounded by a representation of the night sky. “Stranger Fruit,” a performance set at the installation, will function in three parts: rock/alternative vocalist Imani Uzuri will sing excerpts of Rumi’s poetry in the style of Negro spirituals; the Harvard KeyChange will perform an a cappella remix of “Strange Fruit,” a song condemning lynching that was popularized by Billie Holiday; and members of KeyChange will hold a call-and-response with Uzuri. “The viewership and interaction [of ‘Stranger Fruit’] will sprinkle on and marinate [‘Constellation’] long after the performance is done,” Biggers claims.
“Constellation” is the piece that most directly addresses the phenomenon of the Underground Railroad. According to the artist, the starkly bare tree and surrounding night sky are meant to reference the experiences slaves had escaping during cold and dark nights. Biggers incorporated the quilt in order to reference the historical controversy over whether coded messages were stitched into blankets by abolitionists. He points out that it is unclear whether the quilts present historically salient evidence of communication or if they have no importance outside of their aesthetic value. “History is largely conjecture. It is guesses and estimations,” he says. “So much of what we hear about the Underground Railroad is from quilts, but it all might be hearsay.” For Biggers, this ambiguity is a metaphor for his exhibition as a whole.
The centerpiece of “Constellation”—the tree—alludes to a recurring symbol in Biggers’ work. The artist refers to the tree as a “primordial form” and compares its use in his art to a jazz standard, in that it serves as a basis on which he can expand in different artistic directions. For Biggers, a tree can recall the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. However, while the lush and fully grown tree in “Blossom” exudes vivacity, the bareness of the tree in “Constellation” implies death. For Biggers, then, the tree is an “axis mundi...beyond life, fourth-dimensional.”
Biggers explains that “Constellation” incorporates diverse cultural influences in an attempt to challenge the way individuals examine the history of the Underground Railroad and the field of history as a whole. Biggers uses Rumi’s poetry to this end and finds that it reveals slavery as a global, rather than an individual, issue. “The world has indulged in [slavery] in various forms throughout time,” he says. For Biggers, this is just one instance of how American history should be examined in a larger, international context; more connections should be drawn between historical events to highlight a shared cultural heritage. “We need to take [history] out of the binary and make it three-dimensional,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entrenched interests often protect themselves at the expense of innovation. Barack Obama can’t reconcile that tradeoff. The president spent Wednesday in Wisconsin explaining his revolutionary $4.35 billion Race to the Top initiative, which will give states an immediate monetary incentive to reform dilapidated public schools.
Race to the Top is a part of the broader American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. While it constitutes only a small fraction of the $96.8 billion allocated to the Department of Education under the stimulus package, it will be money well spent.
The program itself is an innovative one—a creative way for the federal government to incentivize reform of public education without sacrificing its historically local character. It is precisely because of this local character, though, that city and state school boards have been so easily bullied by big teachers’ unions into maintaining the status quo. Race to the Top will not only counter the influence of unions but also defer to the longstanding autonomy of local school boards to implement policies of their own choosing.
Equally inventive is that, despite frequent accusations of socialism, Obama is injecting the program with a healthy dose of competition. Grants will only be awarded to as few as 20, or even 10, of the states that apply—a condition that can only benefit students as states attempt to find innovative ways to out-reform one another.
States that apply for grant money must demonstrate a will, capacity, and plan to create legal, regulatory, and technological conditions that foster reform in line with the president’s vision for public education.
The most radical and most specific detail of the program is also the one most aggravating to teachers’ unions—states that have so-called “firewall laws” will be ineligible. Due largely to the clout of teachers’ unions, many states maintain such legislation, which prevents school boards from factoring in student performance on standardized tests when evaluating teachers or assigning their pay grades.
Removing such laws and instituting merit pay would incentivize teachers to be innovative in the classroom and pursue methods that work while avoiding those that do not. Schools could also use test scores to identify trouble spots and intervene quickly. We are not suggesting that teachers necessarily ought to be paid less than at present or that they should be fired, only that those who produce the best results should be rewarded accordingly.
The president is also encouraging states to make establishing more publicly funded, non-unionized charter schools a priority in their grant applications. While not all charter schools have proven themselves better than traditional public schools, they are the laboratories in which to test innovative new models of education. Extensive experimentation is impossible in traditional public schools and is vital to solving the nation’s education woes. Race to the Top promises to forge an environment that will nourish and support the best of the charter schools rather than allow unions to stifle them.
Obama has stressed that if a state’s application has union support, it will win extra points when being reviewed by the Department of Education. With $4.35 billion on the table, legislators will surely look to have unions on board. This is a wise move that should help quell union discontent and prevent any disruption in schools.
Already in Wisconsin, the prospect of grant money has unions agreeing to allow standardized testing to be a factor in teacher evaluation so long as it is not used as grounds for firing. While this may lead to bad teachers simply cycling through the worst schools, this compromise is leagues better than the stagnation so characteristic of public-school policy. It is an encouraging sign that Race to the Top is already working before even a single dollar has been spent.

As the skies turn gray for winter, Harvard’s colors are only getting greener. Continuing a promising pattern of leading higher education in sustainability, Harvard signed a 15-year deal this week that will ensure that 10 percent of the energy needs for its Cambridge and Allston buildings will be provided by wind power from the New England-based company First Wind. Not only does this decision reflect Harvard’s commitment to reducing its impact on the environment—making it the fourth-largest consumer of green power for U.S. colleges—it also sets an example for institutions of Harvard’s size, encouraging them to take risks and serve as the initial buyers of green technology.
The purchase of 50 percent of the power from First Wind’s Stetson II farm near Danforth, Maine (scheduled to be fully operating by mid-2010), will add to Harvard’s greening efforts, which already include wind turbines on top of the Holyoke Center and Soldiers Field parking lot, along with new 500-kilowatt  solar panels nearly two and a half football fields in length that will be put on a Harvard-owned building in Watertown, Mass. Even amidst budget cuts and endowment losses, Harvard’s continued commitment to lowering its greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016 provides tangible proof of the university’s belief in reducing its impact on the environment.
Harvard has taken a comprehensive approach to wind power by purchasing not only the power from the soon-to-be-built farm (which comes at market and often cheaper than market prices), but also the renewable energy credits for that energy. RECs can be sold separately from the power itself to companies looking for environmental investments. Harvard has wisely acquired the RECs that are coming with their newly bought power, allowing them to profit from the wind farm in which they will be investing. Harvard has also wielded its economic power and sheer size to effect change in the green industry by providing enough funds to move the Stetson II wind farm from blueprints into reality. A representative from the university’s Public Affairs and Communications office said that Harvard’s 15-year agreement assured First Wind that it would have enough clients to go through with the construction of the farm.
Setting aggressive targets for 2016 was a bold public move by the university, but succeeding in reaching those goals will be as publicly lauded. With the economy in flux and budget cuts everywhere, Harvard has shown its true colors by executing projects that will reduce its environmental impact, ensuring that it will be a green winter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Luke Skywalker had Darth Vader, Michael Jordan had the entire NBA, and, in the darkest of days, Martin Luther King Jr. had the waning stars of Dixie.
Within recent memory, young American heroes have been defined by combat: They’ve engendered respect and admiration—especially from my generation—by bashing the bad guys.
It is thus all the more remarkable that President Obama, millennial idol, generally refrains from demonizing his opponents. Paradoxically elected as both a progressive champion and a national unifier, he has thus far managed to foster populism with minimal malice. Although Obama has certainly not been lenient with greedy bankers or seedy polluters, he has refused to completely vilify any particular group as the cause of our problems.
To some, this seems like it all changed last Saturday. During his weekly address, the president came out swinging against the health-insurance industry: “For decades, whenever we have tried to reform the system, the insurance companies have done everything in their considerable power to stop us,” he said. Their all-too-familiar “bogus” tactics of “smoke and mirrors” will no longer be tolerated. For the first time, it appears, the president drew a permanent line between a single special interest and the American public.
That directness has made some citizens who yearn for aggressive leadership—especially young college progressives—ecstatic. Yet Obama will not suddenly morph into a self-righteous crusader. Although the speech was indeed more forceful than usual, it was nothing compared to Roosevelt’s 1936 election address, in which our 32nd president pinned blame for the country’s economic woes on “business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, [and] war profiteering.”
Ultimately, Obama is not a vanquisher of evildoers, but something much less dramatic—and much more powerful.
Obama may be elite in many aspects, but in his judgment of others he is still the most sacred of all things in America: a common man, a humble sinner. Like his own personal hero, President Lincoln, Obama believes that, although great sin exists in the world, we are all a mixture of virtue and vice and must therefore be humble in our attempts to master it. He believes that, while some in our society may be more blameworthy than others, all Americans are to some degree complicit in the nation’s shortcomings and that all citizens must thus work together to further the American dream. Although anger plays its part, it is not in the president’s character to completely, permanently condemn any sector of society.
On Saturday, Obama rightly thrashed the health-insurance industry for spoiling potential common ground—yet, in the big picture, he still held back from placing all sins on the companies’ shoulders. The president worked cordially with the firms this summer and is now chastising them in order to pass the bill rather than to punish wrongdoing. In this sense, he holds true to an inclusive, mostly animosity-free patriotism: moving into the 21st century, every American must be mutually responsible regardless of where the blame lies. Obama is not ignorant of the necessity of pointing out faults in order to create change: There is no doubt that the health-insurance industry has much to answer for. But, ultimately, the insurance firms will not hang on the public gallows.
For young supporters of the administration, charity toward all and malice toward none may seem a strange idea. Angry voices cry that if there ever was a time for aggressive progressivism, it is now. Yet the lesson that productive politics can’t rest solely on victimhood and vengeance is one that my generation must come to learn, and that older generations should begin to remember, if we are to meet the challenges ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago today, I was clearing out my office. I was in Ashtabula County (population approximately 100,000), working as a field organizer for the Barack Obama campaign in Ohio. Being a field organizer meant I occupied a position on the lowest rung of paid staff. My job was to recruit volunteers to knock on doors and call their neighbors asking them to vote Obama. Our office was a former supermarket whose buzzing lights, paucity of electrical outlets, and poor acoustics made it singularly ill-suited for all the electronics and phonebanking of a campaign outpost.
When the head of the local Democratic Party announced the results on election night—a year ago Wednesday—campaign volunteers and their families cheered as Barack Obama laid claim to a decisive victory in Ashtabula County, even in many of the rural townships in the southern parts of the county. He overcame questions about his patriotism and his purported inability to relate to rural Ohioans in small towns like Orwell, Rome, and Denmark because those places had been feeling the pressure of an economy on the decline since well before Lehman fell.
The city of Ashtabula, once the final destination on the Underground Railroad, is an hour outside of Cleveland. A third if not more of the storefronts in the mall were already empty when I arrived. The Obama campaign shared a large and desolate strip mall with an unemployment office that always had a steady stream of people walking through its doors.
I worked the southern part of the county. My turf was mostly rural, and Amish horse-drawn buggies were not uncommon. Overwhelmingly, the question on people’s minds when I knocked on their doors was whether voting for Obama would mean they could gain universal access to affordable health care. If there was a second question, it usually concerned the economy and bringing jobs back to a county and a region that my generation would need to look up on Wikipedia to know it was called the Manufacturing Belt before it became the Rust Belt.
The dominant narrative in the press coverage of the one-year anniversary of Barack Obama’s election is that of a transcendent politician brought back to earth by the weight of The System in Washington. His first year has been a legislative slog, but after health care is passed, and if climate change follows in early 2010, it could be remembered as one of change and progress on a massive scale.
But through the din of the commentariat, I try to keep Ohio and Ashtabula County as points of reference. By comparison to this time two years ago, 300,000 more Ohioans are without jobs. A year ago, unemployment was at 6.9 percent before rapidly escalating to 10.2 percent, where it stood in February as Obama was settling into the White House. In September, the unemployment rate stood at 10.1 percent across Ohio and nearly 14 percent in Ashtabula. Unemployment in Ohio has been higher than the U.S. average since late 2003.
Some national policies enacted over the last year have certainly helped. The stimulus bill has meant important road-works projects throughout Ashtabula County, and some larger-scale projects are now in the pipeline thanks to grant money that was not available before. But these are stopgap measures and hardly constitute a coherent policy for long-term economic recovery in the Rust Belt. They accomplish little else than to temporarily allay the fears engendered by high unemployment figures.
Speaking to friends back in Ashtabula over the last couple of days I tried to get a sense of attitudes toward Obama and the state of the union. One former volunteer characterized the mood toward Obama’s presidency as one of tempered positivity. “I really don’t hear much negativity in my day-to-day about things he’s done…I don’t see people in Ashtabula being as negative about government as during the Bush years,” he ventured.
“Optimistic, but high unemployment, fewer social services, worse education, and some large-scale public works projects. That’s Ashtabula for ya.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing criticism for the weakness of Harvard College’s advising system, University Hall established the Peer Advising Fellows four years ago to replace the perpetually unpopular Prefect program. Believing that a lack of commitment by prefects partially doomed the freshman-mentoring program, the administration decided to energize advisors by paying the new PAFs an annual stipend of $1,000 for their efforts. Four years and hundreds of thousands of dollars later, the fundamental miscalculation to pay the Fellows still goes unchallenged. But to establish a genuine culture of peer-based mentorship and to save precious resources in the middle of a budget crunch, University Hall should do now what it should have done at the program’s inception: let PAFs advise for free.
The decision to pay these students in the first place was rooted in flawed logic. After long discussions with the program’s director, it became clear to me that the Advising Programs Office believed paying PAFs made them take the position more seriously; administrators thought that if Fellows viewed the mentorship as a job, they would be more likely to log the necessary hours. University Hall also reasoned that, by paying PAFs, students who would otherwise seek part-time employment could instead apply to the program.
The truth of the matter is that some, if not most, of the Fellows are unaware of the program’s stipend when they apply; it’s an added bonus rather than a reason for advising. UHall is out of touch with the realities of undergraduate psychology if it thinks that paying an extremely low hourly wage will motivate performance—successful PAFs view the responsibility as a pleasure rather than a duty, and the salary does not factor into their level of commitment. The Peer Advising Fellows I’ve seen who have neglected their duties have done so because they’re too busy, their relationships with advisees never materialized, or they were unsure of a successful advisor’s day-to-day duties. “Bad” Fellows don’t feel moral remorse for neglecting their duties as an employee; more often than not, they don’t believe that they’re being bad advisors, and those stipend checks that come only twice a year seem to slip into the back of one’s mind when up against a hard midterm deadline. In short, I’ve never met a Peer Advising Fellow—good or bad—who thought that he should probably attend a study break in order to earn his hourly wage from the APO.
While the decision to pay PAFs wastes limited funds and relies on flawed logic, it also negatively alters how Fellows and freshmen think about the program. The APO believes that freshmen are more comfortable utilizing their advisors if they know they’re paid; after all, they’re employees of the College, right? In reality, this dynamic ignores the real motivation of most PAFs who take on the role: They want to take incoming freshmen under their wing. They want to engage in community-building rather than money-grubbing. They want to give freshmen the advice that they themselves were not lucky enough to receive. Paying the advisors cheapens the nature of this relationship, transforming it from a culture of upperclassman mentorship to a tawdry exchange of smoothies on Mt. Auburn.
Additionally, the biggest weakness of the PAF program lies in Fellows running short on money. Those who take their advisees out for lunch and dinner find that the APO has given them barely enough funds to provide more than Oreo cookies and Doritos at weekly study breaks. Eliminating salaries for Peer Advising Fellows would not only redirect limited monies in an economic crunch but would also correct the ideological design flaw that made the program about money instead of advising for some.
High-quality students won’t stop applying to be PAFs because they’re not getting paid; it is more likely that ending payment will weed out the students who get involved for the wrong reasons. The APO could also consider making the position work-study for those who couldn’t afford to advise otherwise. Historically, the program has received the careful attention and funds it needs to thrive, and it marks a commendable improvement from the system that was in place before I got to Harvard. By ending the payment of Fellows, University Hall would refocus the PAF program on its core commitment: building intergenerational community at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As if the global financial meltdown weren’t enough, this spring introduced scary words like “novel virus” and “pandemic,” bumping the financial crisis off the headlines.  The attention-grabbing RNA virus took the world by surprise and, thanks to air travel, spread rapidly from its origin in Mexico to every continent.    The virus’ spread was a perfect storm of mutation (a combination of swine, human, and avian elements), little to no human immunity, and no available vaccine against it.  To make matters worse, everyone was touting its similarity to the 1918 H1N1 virus that had wiped out 20 percent of the world population.
Fortunately, the ensuing months alleviated those fears.  From the outset, many things went right.  The internet allowed for sharing of public health information easily between countries.  The World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control tracked the virus internationally and nationally and communication flow regarding infection rates and recommended treatment was seamless.  Harvard, like many other institutions, had developed a preparedness plan a few years ago in response to the potential threat of the avian flu (H5N1) virus.  Consequently, a multidisciplinary team, drawn from University Health Services, University Hall, Harvard University Dining Services, and the University Operations Services’ Environmental Health and Safety department, was in place to respond immediately when the initial cases of H1N1 hit Harvard.
Even more reassuring was the fact that most patients who were getting ill in the spring had only mild to moderate symptoms.  After a relatively quiescent period over the summer, we began to see a steady stream of cases of H1N1 beginning at the end of August.
Since August, we have seen over 400 cases of influenza-like illness, with nearly 300 undergraduates affected going to UHS.  Our strategy has been three-pronged.  First, we have been educating the Harvard community about flu prevention by advising good hand washing, covering one’s cough, and social distancing from sick individuals. Second, this fall we implemented a large-scale immunization program offering 17,000 vaccines against the seasonal flu.  Through this effort, we were able to inoculate over a third of the undergraduate community. Finally, we have been advising self-isolation for individuals diagnosed with ILI.  About 46 percent of students diagnosed with ILI were sent back to their single rooms with meals provided to their rooms by HUDS.  Another 42 percent of students, who lived in shared rooms, were kept in Stillman Infirmary or other campus singles.  About 11 percent of students were either sent home to convalesce if they lived within a 150-mile radius of Harvard, or moved to other off-campus locations.
Luckily, most of what we have seen of this illness has been reassuring.  Most people have had relatively short and uneventful courses of illness, usually lasting about 4 to 7 days.  New England has had a relatively low incidence of illness compared to the rest of the country—a finding that some are attributing to our higher incidence in the spring possibly inducing some low-level immunity in our community.  Older people have been similarly less affected, possibly because of their immunological  “memory” of earlier exposures.
Following CDC guidelines, we cultured the first few cases, and once we had confirmed that we had documented H1N1 in our community, we proceeded to make the diagnosis of subsequent cases based on clinical features (fever, cough, headache, muscle aches).  Antiviral agents—such as Tamiflu—have been reserved only for those patients who are at higher risk for complications.
Now that the first shipment of H1N1 vaccine has arrived, we have started our second wave of vaccinations, prioritizing the highest risk patients first.    In the meantime, people can protect themselves by continuing to wash their hands, maintaining social distancing from sick individuals, and checking the website for information about availability of the H1N1 vaccine.   With any luck, our regional rates will continue to be low until we get our community vaccinated.  We only wish we could be so fortunate with tackling the global financial crisis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’d gone to University Health Services in the hopes they’d give me something for my light flu symptoms, or maybe some advice on my spirit-crushing depression. Silly me, I was so disillusioned with life I didn’t even realize I had contracted H1N1 until they told me. I couldn’t express my gratitude at that point though, as they were sealing me into plastic for transport.
I was pretty excited to be quarantined in the Dewolfe building, since I’d always wanted a room with a kitchen or a carpet. Sadly I got to enjoy neither, as I was quickly rushed into a small, lightless room sprinkled with the trash and human residue of former occupants. The kindly proctor who unsealed the plastic encasing me offered to get some of my stuff, to make the cell a little more quaint and comfortable. I asked him for my laptop, some books to read with all my free, imprisoned time, and a second pair of underwear. “No problem,” he smiled, heading right out, loosening my shackles and dead bolting the door as he left. Thirty minutes later he brought me a box filled with napkins and a small revolver with a single bullet. Not exactly what I asked for, but it was sweet of him to do what he could.
Checking out my new home I was impressed. They’d provided me with the meals other occupants hadn’t finished, and some really soft towels. That’s about when the H1N1 hit me, swiftly rendering my legs useless and leaving a gentle foam around my mouth as I passed in and out of seizures. “Swine flu,” I mused, “more like the beginnings of a very painful death flu.” Then I convulsed for a little while.
After I was strong enough to sit up without inducing paralytic tremors I decided to call UHS for some information about the university’s H1N1 policy. I also longed for the sound of another human’s voice.
Speaking with Mental Health Services proved fascinating. One doctor with whom I spoke said there was some unease in the department about how healthy it was to hermetically seal students into dark, barren rooms and refuse them access to friends, possessions, or other small human dignities. Apparently MHS had to fight to keep UHS from stitching red patches bearing the word “SWINE” onto the clothes of the infirmed. “We’re hoping next year the university will let us provide assistance to the sick in the form of sun-lamps. We’re really optimistic that sun-lamps could make the swine flu experience a little less sad and dehumanizing,” said one source.
There were a few moments when I was certain that I was going to die, like absolutely certain—too weak and feeble even to call home and tell my parents I was sorry for all the awful things I’d done to my sister. With nausea so vicious I stopped moving oxygen into my body, literally blacking-out every few minutes on account of all the coughing, I was sure going any longer without medicine would kill me. Luckily my meal arrived, containing with it two aspirins. They didn’t alleviate much of the white, enveloping pain I felt, but taking tiny bites from each pill over the course of many hours let me bask in the illusion that I was consuming real medicine. It was this semblance of hope that kept me alive.
I don’t mean to sound like a pessimistic Peter—there were some great things about my quarantine. For one I got to meet Brett, a tall, mask-wearing junior from Lowell. Brett and I didn’t get to talk much, on account of his prolonged bout of dry-heaving, but we agreed to stay friends even after the misfortune that had brought us together was over. The other great thing was the food. Some people have said that the diet of soup and popsicles was unsatisfying, but these people are crazy. What’s better than soup? At every meal? Even if one tired of soup there were two flavors of popsicle—cherry and plain.
By the time my quarantine was over, I was happy that I’d gotten to have such a unique college experience. Admittedly, the being alone on the verge of death part wasn’t great, but it did help me confront a lot of my deepest fears, and for that I’m forever grateful to UHS.
My advice to other Harvard students would be to use the Purell dispensers. Initially I was skeptical, assuming budget cuts were forcing President Faust to seek corporate sponsors for commencement. “We’ll do it!” shouted Purell, already setting up the first of many habit-forming hygiene stations. (By now I’m pretty convinced this was not the case.)
My last piece of advice is that you should download UHS’s H1N1 iPhone app. While it isn’t able to diagnose your symptoms over the phone, its T-Pain feature allows you to harmonize your coughs four ways. At the very least, the synchronization of your sickness with “Buy You a Drank” will elicit a few nervous laughs from friends.
In the end, I guess it’s more about how you’re quarantined, rather than how you aren’t quarantined. If this doesn’t make total sense, then I guess you just haven’t yet suffered a fever that melts a huge piece of your cerebral cortex.

The media loves epidemics. Every year the public is bombarded with headlines that leverage scary acronyms like SARS, MRSA, and H5N1 to capture our attention. This alphabet soup of pandemics is part and parcel of a perennial American diet consisting of hype and overreaction to illnesses with miniscule mortality rates.
Annual uproars over illnesses tend to inure college students to a genuine fear of CNN’s virus du jour. Before my experience with swine flu, I numbered among these apathetic adolescents--what 4-letter headline, I thought, could possible defeat my Übermensch immune system? Armed with this confidence and the hand-sanitizing station in front of the DeWolfe elevators, I carried on with the business of life.
Then, one fateful Tuesday night, I was en route to gorge myself on monkeybread when I was waylaid by a porky adversary. What I originally thought was a severe cold soon proved to be significantly more burdensome than an itchy throat and a runny nose. I decided to take my chances with UHS.
As I sat in the UHS waiting area with nothing but a headache to keep me company, I reflected upon my physical state. I did not know, and still do not know, if I had swine flu: at the time, UHS was not equipped to identify H1N1. But, ,if it was swine flu, it certainly did not hit me with the force that overeager media outlets had portended. I had been able to walk to UHS independently, and although my sudden fever was a source of constant consternation, this was not the worst illness that I had ever dealt with, just the one currently in vogue.
After taking my temperature and learning of my symptoms, the pleasant UHS nurse and physician informed me that I was not well enough to interact with my healthier peers. Armed with four facemasks, two Tylenol tablets, one PowerAde, two saltine crackers, and numerous well-wishes, I was sent off to quarantine. As I sat in my swine shuttle on the way from UHS, I fretted over my dilemma. Would I be relegated to a concrete prison in Mather? Or worse, would I serve my illness-fated sentence in the hinterlands of the Quad?
It turns out that my stay in the pigpen would commence only a few doors down from my normal DeWolfe residence, in the palatial balconied residence whose occupants had seemed mysteriously absent all year. Surgical mask firmly in place, I began the intensely boring process of isolated recovery.
Life in quarantine is best described as maddening, yet comfortable. The health and dining services made sure that my co-swine and I were well-accommodated by giving us our own bedrooms. The room was clearly furnished for utility rather than luxury with its two towels and copious quantities of Kleenex: This was a place where you were meant to get better and get out so that the next sickly sophomore could take your place. Standard fare consisted of an abundance of easily ingested foods like bananas, tea, pseudo-ramen, and Jell-o: a far cry from gourmet cuisine, but decent enough to get you healthy before you tired of it. .
Besides minor frustrations, like the perpetually melting popsicles, the care I received was commendable. Harvard has clearly approached the issue with thoughtfulness and efficiency in mind. Their efforts to make the recuperative process relatively painless were evident in the finer details, from the deluxe Dial in the bathroom to the glut of semi-solid fare. Several days and several Advil later, I was ready to leave the abode that UHS had constructed for me and others laid low by this year’s virus of note. After my experience, I can confidently vouch that the quarantine strategy is one of Harvard’s few policies with virtually no major flaws: I did not want for anything but more heat-resistant popsicles.

Officials at the University Health Services will advise all undergraduates to be vaccinated against swine flu in sharp contrast to Massachusetts policy and to a just-completed Harvard Medical School study that will recommend against mass immunization of young adults.
UHS hopes to offer the controversial vaccine to “high-risk” patientsthose over 65 or with chronic illnesses late in October, and to the rest of the University community two or three weeks afterwards. In line with federal policy, the clinic will urge all but children to roll up their sleeves for the vaccine.
The state department of public health, on the other hand, will recommend the vaccine only to high-risk groups, suggesting other citizens weigh the risks and benefits for themselves.
“There is no medical evidence to justify a mass program,” Tony Dutra ’74, head of the Massachusetts swine flu project, said yesterday.
The Harvard study, appearing today in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimates the cost-effectiveness of a mass immunization program and concludes that vaccination makes sense for most adults.
But last night Stephen C. Schoenbaum, assistant professor of Medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and one of the study’s directors, said, “I would prefer to immunize young adults under 25 only if they have some chronic illness.”
Sholem Postel, associate director of UHS, said last night that he had not seen the Harvard study, but said it was unlikely to prompt UHS to alter its plans.
Clinical trials this summer showed the swine flu vaccine to be considerably less effective among young adults than among older people. The vaccine successfully produced antibodies in about 50 percent of subjects under 25, compared to a success rate of 70 to 90 percent in the older population.
In addition, the Harvard study compiled its figures before the federal government revealed that what may be a crucial component of the vaccine is missing. No one has yet explained what slip-up in the manufacturing process caused the vaccine to be produced without neuraminidase, an enzyme some scientists believe important in triggering a second-line defense to the disease.
Postel said that the clinic is recommending immunization as a “general public health measure,” but that it might be “reasonable” for an individual student to postpone vaccination until—and unless—swine flu reappears. When asked whether such a position might discourage student response, Postel said, “You’re not kidding it will.”
The swine flu program has been shrouded in controversy from its inception. Last March, President Ford recommended a crash program to vaccinate “each and every American” against swine flu, after one soldier died in an isolated outbreak of the disease at Fort Dix.
Critics, including a minority of state health officials, Ralph Nader’s Health Research Group, The New York Times, and health officials and medical journals in England, France and Canada, have disputed government estimates of the likelihood of an epidemic, its probable severity and the effectiveness of the vaccine itself.
Sidney Wolfe of the HRG said this summer, “The major disease in the U.S. this year related to Fort Dix will not be swine flu but, rather, swine flu vaccine disease.” The Lancet, a respected British medical journal, concluded that the swine flu virus “seemed to be not very good at infecting man and may have died out as a result” and implied that the U.S. response to a minimal danger,” and suggested that the government stockpile the vaccine and administer it only if swine flu reappeared.
The government has responded to that suggestion by claiming that given the logistics of mass immunization, 12 weeks or more might elapse between the initial discovery of swine flu and the protection of the American population--too long to stave off an epidemic.
But Dutra estimated that his office could “get the vaccine into people’s arms” three to five weeks after swine flu appeared, which Dutra said would be “plenty of time,” because even if swine flu returns it will probably do so in small, sporadic outbreaks.
“There is absolutely minimal to the nth power chance of a pandemic this winter,” he added.

Despite the distraction of mid-terms and the widespread publicity concerning swine flu vaccine’s possible side effects, almost 5000 people received the vaccine early this week in the UHS three-day immunization program.
“The turnout was larger than we expected based on reports from other clinics,” Dr. Sholem Postel, associate director of UHS, said yesterday.
Seventeen per cent of Harvard’s eligible population has received the vaccine compared to only seven per cent of the national population.
Postel said those who chose not to receive the vaccine probably feared side effects or thought the vaccine pointless because there has been no recent swine flu recurrence.
If a swine flu epidemic should break out, attitudes will probably change and UHS may have to conduct another immunization program, he added.
Postel said a repeat program would not be a problem because there is “no real shortage” of swine flu vaccine.
However, Postel said there is a shortage of the bivalent vaccine now given only to high-risk persons. The bivalent vaccine is more effective and ideally should be given to everyone, he said.
This week’s immunization went smoothly and no serious reactions to the vaccine have occurred or are likely to occur, Postel said.
Although at least half a dozen people per day fainted after receiving the vaccine, they were probably responding to the situation and not the vaccine itself, Postel added.
Many more people received the vaccine on the second and third days of the immunization program, perhaps due to reports that the vaccine was relatively painless and simple, Postel said.
Although UHS has returned 10,000 of the 18,000 monovalent vaccines they received from the government, people who wish to be vaccinated may call the UHS immunization center and ask for an appointment.
About 37,000 students, faculty members, employees and their family members are eligible to receive the shots.

When swine flu made national headlines last spring, it wasn’t the first time.  A similar flu scare began in February, 1976, with the sudden death of 19-year-old Pvt. David Lewis of Fort Dix, New Jersey. He was found to have been killed by “swine flu,” a virus thought to resemble the one responsible for the 1918 flu pandemic. On the advice of worried health officials, president Gerald Ford ordered the implementation of a mass inoculation program. Unfortunately, reports surfaced that the vaccine was causing people to develop an autoimmune disorder and had resulted in several deaths.  The program ended abruptly on Dec. 16. Thirty years later, swine flu has reemerged as a prime health concern, with the same attendant public paranoia. This focus examines the H1N1 epidemic and its impact on the Harvard community, both in terms of the university’s public health response and student experiences of illness, whether serious or facetious. Including a Crimson article chronicling the 1976 scare, it aims to provide perspective, and poke some fun at, our current public health woes.

The Red Line of the T, which serves as a primary mode of transportation for Cambridge residents and Harvard students, is currently in danger of a potential train derailment, according to a report released Wednesday.
The investigation, which was commissioned by Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 in August, found that leaking water has caused the concrete slabs holding the train tracks to decay and shift out of place in the stretch of the Red Line that runs between the Harvard and Alewife stations.
Additionally, although the trains used on the Red Line are generally considered to have a 25-year lifespan, 74 of the route’s 218 trains are 40 years old and should have been replaced 15 years ago.
These urgent issues are two of the over 50 high-concern safety-related repair projects that the T system will not be able to address this year due to a lack of funding, the report noted.
“There is abundant evidence that the service and safety issues that plague the MBTA [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority] are considerably worse than is commonly understood—and are becoming critically worse,” said the report.
David F. D’Alessandro, the primary author of the report and the former chairman of John Hancock Financial Services, said during a press conference Wednesday that he would personally avoid riding certain portions of the Red Line.
David Luberoff, the executive director of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government’s Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston and an expert on the city’s transportation system, said that the report’s findings are “serious” and “sobering,” as “the Red Line is a hugely important part of the Boston transportation network.”
Despite the investigation’s findings, Massachusetts Department of Transportation spokesman Colin B. Durrant said that the T is “absolutely” safe to ride.
“While there are safety concerns, we believe it’s a safe system,” Durrant said. “Everybody there at the MBTA is working to ensure the safety of riders everyday.”
He added that the governor himself rode the Red Line yesterday to emphasize his faith in the safety of the T.
Yet the governor’s symbolic action did not allay the fears of all local residents traveling on the Red Line yesterday.
“It’s pretty dangerous,” said Michelle Hwang, a student at Bunker Hill Community College. “It should be corrected, developed, and changed.”
In addition to showing his trust in the safety of the T, Durrant also said that Patrick plans to address the safety issues raised by the report, noting that the governor has asked Secretary and CEO of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation Jeffrey B. Mullan to “re-prioritize projects based on safety concerns.” Patrick has also asked D’Alessandro to review the plan that the MBTA and the Department of Transportation devise to remedy the T’s problems.
In addition, Patrick requested that Mullan find the MBTA a new leadership team, as the organization remains in transition after MBTA General Manager Daniel A. Grabauskas resigned in August.
D’Alessandro’s report suggests that the underlying problem with the MBTA system is that it is drastically underfunded, forcing the organization to put aside certain safety projects to pay for other expenses. According to the report, the problem began in 2000, when the state decided to make the MBTA “financially self-sufficient” by providing it with a fixed annual subsidy instead of paying the MBTA’s expenses at the end of the fiscal year, as had been done in the past.
Over the last eight years, this set subsidy has proven insufficient by a total of $558 million.
The shortcoming in funds is partially due to an unforeseeable doubling in the price of fuel and utility costs in the past decade, but Luberoff noted that some of the initial cost predictions seem strange nonetheless, particularly the governmental assumption that health costs for workers would not increase over the eight-year period.

Public support for proposed health care legislation hinges more on how it promises to impact individuals, rather than on its potential effect on the nation as a whole, according to a study earlier this week from Harvard School of Public Health researchers.
Robert J. Blendon, a doctor and professor at the School of Public Health, said the paper showed the importance of individual interests in framing the national health care debate, adding that legislators have “lost track of the fact that the American people are discussing how this will affect them.”
For the study, researchers analyzed public opinion regarding former president Bill Clinton’s proposed 1994 health care reform—suggesting that the legislation’s failure was due to peoples’ doubts that it would have an overall positive effect on them individually, despite their recognition of the national need for health care reform.
The research shows that 15 years later, support for health care reform still fluctuates based on how certain aspects of the legislation are presented—specifically, the public option and the cost to the individual. This is happening despite the fact that a majority of the American public believes that the nation needs health care reform, according to polling data.
The recent study is the first paper to single out individual opinion as a factor in the health care debate, Blendon said, while most political scientists believe the public is most concerned with the national effects of reform.
Amitabh Chandra, a professor of public policy and director of health policy research at the Kennedy School, said that Blendon’s results were manifest in American politics, adding that it is “absolutely true” that public opinion regarding current health reform is based more on how it affects each person individually than impact on the nation. Chandra added that what the American public wants for themselves is often in the long run good for the United States.
John M. Benson, an author of the paper, advised that proponents of health care reform persuade the public by focusing on individual impact of legislation in keeping with the study.
Those debating health care “need to tell people somehow how the reforms will affect them so they can better judge what their opinion will be,” said Benson, who is a research associate at the School of Public Health. He encouraged both supporters and opponents of the bill to focus the discussion on aspects that will realistically influence the American public.

Brandon W. Sanderson, who wrote the latest book in the fantasy series “The Wheel of Time” after the death of its original author, appeared at The Coop last night to read from the new novel and to engage about 60 fans in a question and answer session.
The late Robert Jordan started the series in 1990 and authored the first 11 books before his death in 2007, but was unable to finish the final book. “The Gathering Storm,” the 12th installment in the epic fantasy tale, was released last week after a three-year hiatus in the publication of the series. It will take the top spot on The New York Times hardcover fiction best sellers list for the week of Nov. 15 with 40 million copies in print, topping Dan Brown’s “The Lost Symbol,” Sanderson’s representative Elena Stokes wrote in an e-mail.
Sanderson was chosen to finish the series by Harriet McDougal, Jordan’s widow. In an interview yesterday, Sanderson recalled the moment when he received the initial message from McDougal, describing his reaction as “dumbfounded stupefaction” upon being asked to finish a series he had begun reading when he was 15.
Sanderson said that Jordan had created an outline and drafted the final chapter, and he then worked on “tying up” the material without trying to imitate the style of Jordan’s prose.
“My goal has been to make the characters feel as much as themselves as possible,” Sanderson said, emphasizing that he had hoped to “blend” his writing with Jordan’s in spite of their stylistic differences.
Jordan had originally intended for the final book to span 2,500 pages. Instead, it has been divided into three books, each 700 to 800 pages long. The second and third parts of the novel will be released over the course of the next two years.
Sanderson said that readers have noticed parallels between the plot of “The Gathering Storm” and the “military and political climate” of the present day, but he said that any such similarities were unintentional. At the same time, he said, there is some merit in finding metaphors of current events in the book series.
“We seek to explore human experience through larger-than-life situations,” Sanderson said. “[Through fantasy and science fiction], we seek to discover the best and worst of humankind.”
He said he also hopes that contemplating the themes and conflicts in these novels will prepare his readers, especially college students, to deal with similar situations in the real world.
Lenora C. Murphy ’12, an avid fan of the series who was chosen to be a Storm Leader—what she called a “super volunteer”—for yesterday’s event, said she enjoyed the newest installment for its myriad characters and fast-paced plots.
“The minute I got it, I couldn’t put it down,” Murphy said.

Harvard’s campus is no stranger to musical performances, but it has yet to play host to a piece that uses the human body as its score—at least, until the unveiling this Sunday of the Gigue project, which uses computer programs to measure and transform a person’s heartbeat into music.
“The interactive experiences causes the audience member to become the performer,” says creator Yi Wei ’10. “It’s a twisting between performer and audience member and also science and art.”
With the unrolling of “The Laboratory at Harvard” this Sunday, Wei won’t stand alone in trying to bridge disciplinary divides. As part of a growing academic effort to find points of overlap between art and science, Harvard is launching the three-year venture in the Northwest Science Building as a home for projects at the nexus of the two fields.
Laboratory at Harvard founder David A. Edwards has been a leader for the burgeoning movement, authoring a book called “Artscience: Creativity in the Post-Google Generation” that touts the growing body of research as a way to reverse a worrisome trend toward tunnel vision in academic disciplines.
By driving the two disciplines together, he says he hopes to foster a culture of creative innovation often lost amid the strictures of the academic world.
“The very phenomena or processes instinctive to a five-year old child that are key to how that child learns has been driven out of our institutions,” says Edwards. “We need to create sandboxes in our institutions that allow us to be children again in the sense that we are encouraged to move from one corner of the sandbox and not have to justify why we go from one corner to another.”
FROM DREAM TO REALITY
After then-Engineering School Dean Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti recruited Edwards to the faculty of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences with the hope of integrating his entrepreneurial nature into the undergraduate curriculum, they decided to expand more broadly “because innovation and creative people are there in every field,” says Venky. “They are there in arts, the social sciences, and engineering.”
The idea evolved into Edward’s popular class Engineering Sciences 147, “Idea Translation: Effecting Change through the Arts and Sciences.”
“Now I think it has come to a stage where we should really make it somewhat more public,” says Venky, who is also a member of The Laboratory’s Executive Committee. “Hopefully, The Laboratory will really have some strong positive impact on not only our undergrads, but more broadly on society.”
The Laboratory is a collaborative effort between SEAS, the Provost’s Office, the Graduate School of Design, the American Repertory Theater, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Idea Translation Lab, and Le Laboratoire, an art and design center in Paris.
This collaboration between art and science institutions is just one way The Laboratory hopes to bring together the often separate—but in many ways, proponents say, quite similar—disciplines.
“Both in arts and science the concepts of creativity, innovation, research, exploration, and discovery are essential, says Lori E. Gross, the associate provost for arts and culture and a member of the Laboratory Executive Committee. “Artists and scientists actually understand each other very well because they’re involved in this concept of making and researching.”
Gross, Edwards, and Venky all say they hope The Laboratory will serve as a place for students to work together and spark new ideas.
“When you make things, you tend to work more collaboratively and that is very important to the Harvard undergrad spirit,” Gross says.
Edwards says he hopes the lab can inspire students to set into motion ideas that have a cultural value.
“We’re interested in students developing ideas and being able to imagine bringing them all the way to fruition,” Edwards says. “We want to give them as many resources as we can to help that idea go as far as it can.”
FROM IDEA TO PRODUCT
Sunday’s opening celebration for The Laboratory will feature exhibitions by current Harvard undergraduates, ranging from a new way to transport water to a program that translates heart beats into music to a way of making electricity from bacteria in dirt.
When Michael P. Silvestri ’10 saw the difficulty women and children in third-world countries like Namibia had transporting and purifying water with existing resources, he and a team of students developed a new container that was both easy to transport and economically feasible.
“Basically our idea is a portable, collapsible, rugged-use water purification and transportation device that models the form and function of a biological cell,” says Silvestri.
George Zisiadis ‘11 took his project in a different direction, creating Streetview, a new way of experiencing public space.
“It’s an experience via the lives of strangers,” says Zisiadis. “What that means is that people’s memories and experiences within a space are recorded and captured and then people can listen to those memories that people have had in that space by walking around.”
His demo on Sunday will feature an iPhone with a map of Harvard Yard and a block representing a person. Audience members can drag the block around and simulate walking though the yard while experiencing the changing things they would hear if they were actually walking from Memorial Church to Widener Library.
Wei based her Gigue music project off a study done at the Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, which found that healthy hearts literally sound more musical than unhealthy ones. She says she hopes to expand the program to measure more than just heart rate.
“I took that idea and ran with it,” Wei said. “Basically Gigue is an interactive musical experience where music is derived in real time through the senses of our body. I wanted to track people’s biorhythms, like heart rate or gait, in real time, and convert that into music.”
Wei collaborated with programmers who are also musicians to set up her exhibition, which will allow audience members to see their heart rate converted into a melody.
Just like the space in which The Laboratory is being created, these student projects are a still under development.
“The idea of the space is to showcase process,” says W. Hugo Van Vuuren ‘07, a Fellow at SEAS, who will be helping to start up The Laboratory at Harvard. “The space itself is a work in progress. The space is in beta—modular and always evolving.”

Harvard took the top ranking in the seventh annual Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), which was published this week by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, offering a comparison of over 1000 schools worldwide.
The study came on the heels of China’s establishment of the C9, an Ivy League-like group of nine universities in China intended to raise the profile of Chinese education. But while the rankings bore good news for Harvard, none of the ARWU’s top 200 schools was in China.
Fernando M. Reimers, a professor of international education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that the ranking criteria included indicators such as the number of alumni who have received a Nobel Prize, or professors who have conducted respected research.
“The ranking began as a way to measure the quality of higher education in China,” Reimers said. According to Reimers, China’s efforts to improve education are part of the country’s greater push to allow more people to benefit from the country’s economic progress.
Reimers said that, despite Harvard’s high spot in the ranking, there was much for America to learn from China’s education system, where schools, for instance, have a greater focus on reaching out to the public.
But China, Reimers said, also is learning from American schools. “People in China have valued education for a long time,” said Reimers. “But their schools are more geared to passing the college entrance exam. They look to U.S. Schools and research universities because we promote students thinking independently and creatively.”

If you ask a child how they see, they say they open their eyes. Simple enough. But what if you ask the child what’s going on in the eye?
It’s a far more complex question, says Bevil R. Conway, a visiting lecturer in neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, and in trying to answer it, researchers like Conway hope to provide a window into the interplay between art and biology that shapes both how we perceive art and how we create it.
“One of the most attractive things about the study of vision is it’s so immediate and obvious to us,” Conway says. “Art reveals something of the magic of that process and in many ways it reflects the mystery of vision that we often take for granted.”
AN EYE FOR ART
Conway—himself a visual artist who creates sculptures and paintings—is trying to unravel this mystery by researching the neuroscience of color.
“Many of the questions that I tackle try to understand the neuroscientific basis of color, particularly how artists are capable of achieving color contrasts and color constancy effects” he says.
When looking at a finished painting, Conway says he tries to get his students to understand the painting as it was being made, as a “dynamic and changing thing” that reacts to visual feedback and makes one see it differently as it evolves.
“There is a kind of feedback as you’re making a picture—the colors on the canvas are actually changing as you apply other colors next to them,” Conway says. “That dynamic process reflects something about how the visual system works.” In fact, art and art practices are fundamentally constrained by how the visual system works, he says, and the study of art is in some ways in the service of the quest to understand vision.
A MIND FOR ART
Along with Margaret S. Livingstone, a professor of neurobiology at the Medical School, Conway will be teaching a class about art and science for a new Harvard Summer School program.
The program in Trento, Italy was organized by Alfonso Caramazza, a professor of psychology and co-director of the Mind, Brain, and Behavior Interfaculty Initiative. “The idea was to create a program that would be interesting for students who are excited about biology and the brain but also about the mind,” says Caramazza.
Conway and Livingstone’s class, “What Art Can Tell Us About the Brain,” will introduce students to the fundamentals of visual neuroscience and then become more hands-on, with trips to local studios and museums so students can more intimately experience the connection between art and science.
The course emphasizes studying art in order to understand how the human mind construes it and what assumptions must be made about the visual system to allow the brain to create such art, according to Caramazza.
“You have both insights into the visual system on the one hand but also insights about the mind that creates the object and that reflects what the visual system is capable of doing,” Caramazza says.
THE PRACTICAL SIDE
Echoing Conway, Livingstone, who studies how art can “reflect and reveal things about what we see,” says that both art and visual neuroscience influence each other.
“Seeing is so easy that we don’t realize that it’s really a bunch of neurons firing away up there,” Livingstone says. “Their whole job is to extract information about the environment, and how these patterns of neurons fire is really a nontrivial thing.”
Artists often use the computations and algorithms performed by the firing of neurons in the brain to produce certain effects in paintings.
For example, a large part of our visual system is color-blind—the parts that are evolutionarily older and are engaged in detecting motion and separation between figure and background, while the more primate-specific areas are color-selective, says Livingstone.
The shimmering in paintings is caused by this very discrepancy between the color-sensitive and color-insensitive parts of the brain. The effect seems magical to the viewer but is based on simple neuroscientific principles.
“Making pictures is something we as viewers consider to be quite a mystical event,” Conway says. “What it underscores is the mystery and the magic of vision itself.”

Two experts on child advocacy urged law school students to use creative means to effect social change during a Harvard Law School course yesterday, emphasizing the need for lawyers to train in issues pertaining to child protection.
The course, called “Art of Social Change: Child Welfare, Education, and Juvenile Justice,” is part of a four-course series under the Child Advocacy Program (CAP) at the law school.
The first speaker in yesterday’s lecture was Gail Garinger, the first Child Advocate for the Commonwealth—a position that had not existed previously in the state.
Garinger pointed out the necessity of increasing funding for child protection.
“We pay a lot of lip service to how much we value children, but I am not sure we do enough to protect children and faithfully keep them in their families,” Garinger said. “We don’t put our money where our mouth is.”
In contrast, Erik Pitchal, an assistant clinical professor of law at Suffolk Law School and yesterday’s second guest speaker, said that the country’s youth needed to participate more in child welfare processes.
“There needs to be far more involvement by children and youth themselves, those in the system and children in general who care about what is happening with their peers,” he said.
CAP founder and Harvard Law School lecturer Jessica S. Budnitz said that the program exposes students to a variety of viewpoints.
“We really want to inspire students to see the range in which they can use their legal skills training,” she said.
“Art of Social Change,” which has an enrollment of over 100 students, invites leaders in a diverse range of child advocacy roles to speak and connect with Harvard students.
The course attempts to encourage involvement in community social change, particularly in the traditionally underrepresented field of child advocacy in law institutions.
“There are interesting exchanges and lots of participation at the end of the class,” said Maeve O’Rourke, a law school student enrolled in the class. “We definitely get a chance to interact.”
One of the ways the Child Advocacy Program attempts to expose students to opportunities to be agents of change in society is the Child Advocacy Clinic, which partners with dozens of community organizations in the fields of abuse and neglect, adoption, and foster care, providing direct service experiences for Law School students.
But both Budnitz and Elizabeth Bartholet ’62, the faculty director of CAP, agreed that what they do is still not enough.
“There’s more we would like to do that we can’t possibly do with limited staff that we have,” Bartholet said.
Currently, the program is supported entirely by the Law School and receives no funding from outside sources.

Early signs of divergent evolution in Heliconius butterflies in Ecuador may reveal a missing link to understanding how species form, according to a recent study by Harvard researchers.
The research, published today in the journal “Science,” indicates that evolution due to factors like advantageous mimicry may influence changes in mate preference that further propel speciation.
“In nature, you can find things that are clearly the same or clearly different species,” said research fellow Marcus R. Kronforst, an author on the study affiliated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Center for Systems Biology.
“In Ecuador we found something in-between, which provided a big window into understanding how species form.”
The recent study in Western Ecuador was prompted by a 2002 study in Costa Rica, which focused on two species of geographically separated butterflies with a common ancestor. Although these white– and yellow–winged species had once been the same species, members of each preferred mating with butterflies of the same species—an example of what is known as assortative mating preference.
To further explore the connection between speciation and mating preference, Kronforst and four other researchers embarked for Western Ecuador in May 2008.
For two months, Harvard biology post-doctorates Nicola L. Chamberlain and Ryan I. Hill, both authors on the study, stood in an enormous cage of Heliconius butterflies, ready to swoop in and grab males as they fluttered their wings above a female in an attempt to mate.
Chamberlain said the fieldwork was a combination of extremes, involving exciting mountain—bike excursions to collect butterflies followed by hours of sitting and waiting for them to mate. “It was sometimes frustrating when you felt like you were giving it your all but the butterflies were not performing,” Hill added.
Kronforst said that the butterflies in Ecuador were diverging into two groups because each subgroup was evolving to look more like a different species of poisonous butterfly, which conferred an advantage since predators learned more quickly to avoid them.
This mimicry caused some of the population to have yellow wings and others white wings, but the Heliconius group in Ecuador was still genetically identical in every other way, unlike in Costa Rica.
The team found that assortative mating preference in Ecuador was observed some of the time, while in Costa Rica it was observed nearly all the time.
“We think that what we were seeing in Ecuador is an earlier stage in the process of speciation that occurred in Costa Rica,” Kronforst said.
The researchers undertook additional genomics lab work and research into related studies to prove that the population in Ecuador had not yet diverged into two separate species, setting it apart from around 20 other systems that had been studied in the past.
Natural sciences professor Hopi E. Hoekstra, who studies speciation in mice, is excited about the genetic implications of Kronforst’s research.
“Mimicry causing divergence is one thing, but if you have mate choice based on color differences, you’re really setting the stage for finding genes that contribute to reproductive isolation,” she said.

Childhood cancer survivors may be more prone to suffer suicidal thoughts later in life than those who have remained healthy throughout childhood, according to a study released last week by a team of Harvard Medical School researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
The Harvard team’s report, released in “Journal of Clinical Oncology,” marks a critical step towards identifying the long-term psychological effects that can result from battling a life-threatening and potentially debilitating illness.
“Most of the professional intervention that these [childhood cancer survivors] get is around their physical health,” said Christopher J. Recklitis, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical School. “This [report] is a reminder to practitioners that if adult survivors of cancer have multiple medical problems they may also be having significant emotional distress and it’s important to stop and ask them about that.”
The study examined the possibility of a link between suicidal thinking and cancer treatment while also drawing a correlation between suicidal thought and patient’s self-assessments of their current health. Those patients who indicated that they were in poor health did register higher incidences of suicidal thought, the study showed.
The report findings indicated that nearly eight percent of childhood cancer survivors reported suicidal thinking compared to only 4.6 percent among a control group composed of the survivor’s siblings.
“This study is a reminder to all of us,” said Recklitis, “that although most survivors are doing well there’s a small group of people who may have intense physical and emotional distress.”
The study surveyed a little over 9,000 adult survivors of childhood cancer and nearly 3,000 siblings already participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.
Participants filled out a survey with their demographic information as well as medical and psychological functioning, including incidence of suicidal thoughts in the past seven days. The results, Recklitis said, were significant.
“Depression and other emotional problems can wax and wane over time,” said Recklitis. “So for eight percent of respondents to report suicidal thoughts in the past seven days is pretty significant.”
The findings highlight how important it is for survivors to seek follow-up care and for the medical community to prepare a multidisciplinary approach to survivor care, said Bruce M. Cohen, president and psychiatrist in chief emeritus, the Medical School’s largest psychiatric facility.
“American health care ranks really high in terms of the effectiveness with which way we can treat people,” Cohen said. “But it doesn’t necessarily rank high in terms of its comprehensive care, how we handle long term care, or whether—after we do something acute to try and help—we then continue to help.”
“If nothing else,” he added. “This study reminds us that it is not good medicine to apply a treatment and not continue to help people in a more holistic way.”

Reptiles and mammals may represent different classes in the animal kingdom, but researchers in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology have found that similar molecular changes cause both a lizard and a shrew to produce a toxin—a discovery that may shed light on similar changes that occur in other animals.
“Our big picture question was how do proteins evolve new functions? How do you go from a harmless digestive enzyme into something that’s a toxin?” said Hopi Hoekstra, an associate professor of natural sciences and one of the authors of the study. “We were particularly interested in the molecular changes that supercharge the enzyme.”
Shrews, along with platypuses, are among the few venomous mammals, and they produce a toxin in modified salivary glands that enters their prey’s circulatory system when they bite, Hoekstra explained.
The toxin is an enzyme, a type of protein that accelerates the rate of chemical reactions by bringing reactants together in the enzyme’s active site.
When lead author Yael T. Aminetzach, a postdoctoral fellow in OEB, compared the toxin to a nontoxic counterpart, she found that the molecular changes occurred in active site of the enzyme. While the toxins from the lizard and the shrew are distinct, the overall trend of changes turned out to be the same.
“There were three very important changes that can potentially increase the catalytic ability of the enzyme,” said Aminetzach. “The active site opened up, the loops around the active site became more flexible, and the surface electrostatic charge changed from negative to positive.”
These general changes may help to better guide the substrates into the active site of the enzyme.
Aminetzach said this week that she hopes to continue with this research and collect data on other snakes and lizards to see whether similar changes in the active site of other enzymes also led to the enzymes eventually evolving into toxins.
Hoekstra added that they also want to learn which of the changes actually cause the protein to become toxic.
“Our long term goal is to reconstruct the protein mutation by mutation and see if all of the amino acid changes are really necessary,” Hoekstra said.

Gay men have the strongest sexual attraction to the most masculinized male faces, according to a study recently published online in the journal “Archives of Sexual Behavior.”
Led by Aaron N. Glassenberg, a doctoral student in organizational behavior at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Business School, the study found that facial attraction depends on a person’s gender rather than his or her sexual orientation.
According to the results, gay men prefer the most masculine faces and straight men prefer the most feminine faces.
In contrast, straight women are not necessarily attracted to the most masculinized male faces and lesbians are not always drawn to the most feminized faces, Glassenberg said.
Other research has shown that female preferences are influenced by a mixture of factors including ovulation, contraceptive use, self-esteem, and sex drive, he added.
The fact that homosexual males are attracted to markedly masculine men could mislead people to suspect that their sexuality is most similar to that of heterosexual women, but based on what is currently known about the preferences of straight women, Glassenberg’s study actually disproves this assumption, according to Carole K. Hooven, a Harvard Human and Evolutionary Biology and Anthropology lecturer.
The study, which was conducted online, asked 900 female and male participants to identify which faces they thought were most attractive from a pool of facial images digitally manipulated to be more masculine or feminine.
Features of the most masculine faces included a broader jaw, broader forehead, and more pronounced brow ridge, while the most feminine faces had a more tapered chin, larger lips, and a narrower forehead.
Glassenberg’s study, he said, marks the first time facial preferences for gay men and lesbian women have been examined.
“There’s a lot of research on heterosexual attraction in the literature, so it was important to fill in what was missing in order to understand attraction better overall,” Glassenberg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last March, the Administrative Board Review Committee presented Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds with a report suggesting potential changes to the Ad Board—Harvard College’s primary disciplinary body—and its policies.
Since the committee finished its report eight months ago, the administration has begun to implement changes in the Ad Board’s review process—starting in May, when Hammonds adopted recommendations from the report that did not require a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. These proposals included altering the role of the resident dean and decreasing the number of Ad Board members who attend hearings in which the accused is present.
Then, at the first Faculty meeting of this year, the Faculty unanimously elected to give the 22-member Faculty Council the power to expel a student, instead of requiring the vote of the full Faculty.
But the report itself has not been made available to the College community—leading those outside the administration to question the exact nature of its content and to call for its public release.
In response to a question posed by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 at the final Faculty meeting of the academic year in May, Hammonds informed those in attendance that she would release the report.
But in a meeting with The Crimson last Thursday, Hammonds said that the report, which she commissioned, would not be made public.
“I thought I had said no, but I guess I said yes. I don’t know if I was nervous or what,” Hammonds said.
UNDER LOCK AND KEY
Although changes to the Ad Board have already begun, professors and Undergraduate Council representatives are still wondering why the entire report has not been released.
Donald H. Pfister, a botany professor and a member of the Ad Board Review Committee, said that the release of the full report would assist future discussions on potential areas of reform.
“I think the intent should be to get the report out,” said Pfister, the former master of Kirkland House. “Whether it’s the original, or a modified version that we can go back over, is not so important to me.”
Lewis said he thinks it would be valuable for the Harvard community to understand the contents of the report before considering future changes, adding that he hoped that some form of the report would be made available before the Faculty was asked to deliberate upon more legislation.
Leaders of the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee, which organizes the Council’s outreach efforts on Ad Board reform, also called for greater transparency from the College administration.
“Obviously we would always like to see things released in the open,” said Student Life Committee Vice Chair Eric N. Hysen ’11, who is also currently running for UC vice president. “[But] more important is the actual substance of the changes.”
A STUDENT VOICE
One recommendation from the committee that has not been publicly released proposes a student presence in disciplinary decisions.
The Ad Board Review Committee advocated a model where students could select one of two committees—one with students and one without—to hear their case, according to Pfister.
Hammonds told The Crimson that there would be recommendations in the spring relating to “student participation in governance,” though the nature of the changes has not been publicly discussed.
Pfister said College disciplinary proceedings would be improved if students were involved in the adjudicating process.
“Students have insight into students’ lives,” Pfister said. “We were looking for ways to take advantage of some of that insight.”
Senan Ebrahim ’12, chair of the UC’s Student Life Committee, said that the issue of student representation in disciplinary proceedings is “absolutely a question at the forefront of everyone’s mind.”
Currently, the only disciplinary body in the College in which students can participate is the Student-Faculty Judicial Board, which has heard only one case in the 20 years of its existence due to its limited purview, according to Jay L. Ellison, associate dean of the College and secretary of the Ad Board.
PLAGIARISM 2.0
Another issue that the Ad Board Committee sought to address in its report is plagiarism in the digital age, but these recommendations have also been withheld from the public eye.
Students, faculty, and administrators have expressed concerns that the College’s plagiarism policies have not kept pace with the expanded use of Internet resources in students’ work.
“It feels different with the Internet than it was 20 years ago when people were going to the library xeroxing books,” Ellison said.
Hammonds said she thinks members of the College community need to have conversations about ways of combating modern forms of plagiarism.
In light of the changes presented by technology, the Ad Board Reform Committee hoped to devise a wider range of punishments so that the Ad Board would be able to impose more appropriate consequences upon plagiarists, Pfister said. Guidelines for punishments are not set by the Ad Board itself, but by the Faculty and the administration.
“The Faculty rules as they stand right now are the ones we enforce,” Ellison said.
DEFENDING NON-DISCLOSURE
Though some students and faculty have expressed a desire to view the contents of the Ad Board report, Hammonds said that the purpose of the document was to provide her with a body of potential recommendations and was never intended for public release.
“I looked through those recommendations and have tried to move forward on a number of them that could be done quickly and that I thought could be very beneficial to the students,” Hammonds said. “There are a set of other ones that will take much longer, and I didn’t really feel that those should be the ones that we should put those out for discussion without having a process for thinking about how we want to deal with those discussions and a process for having discussions and perhaps looking at legislation.”
UC presidential candidate George J.J. Hayward ’11, who is also a Crimson editor, said that although he understands that Hammonds maybe be hesitant to release the report if it contains any details about specific Ad Board cases, he believes that students and faculty should ultimately be informed of the committee’s proposals.
“In terms of the Ad Board Committee’s recommendations, Dean Hammonds has the right to weigh those recommendations and meet with her advisors and her staff and see which are confidential,” Hayward said. “Once those recommendations are decided upon and once they are moving forward, I think students should get the most transparent process possible.”

Renowned Bollywood actress Preity Zinta is adding to her resume of blockbusters by enrolling in an executive course at Harvard Business School next month to study negotiating and deal-making, the Indian media reported this week.
Zinta, who already spends a significant amount of time in the United States, told the Indian media she decided to hit the books to enhance her experience in the country.
“I thought that since I spend so much time in the US, I might as well use the experience better,” Zinta said in an interview with Indian Express.
Zinta, who is recognizable by her right dimple, has starred in popular Hindi movies such as “Kal Ho Naa Ho,” “Veer-Zaara” and “Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna.” She debuted in Bollywood over 10 years ago and currently appears on “Behind the Seams”—a reality television show that follows the lives of cricketers on the Kings XI Punjab team, of which Zinta is a part owner.
In previous interviews, Zinta has not explained her interest in coursework, and a spokesman at the Business School declined to comment further on her status as a student, citing privacy concerns.
Richard S. Delacy, a Harvard preceptor in Urdu-Hindi, said that Zinta has shown an appetite for tackling challenges in her acting career.
“She’s known to be one of the most intelligent actors in India,” Delacy said, describing Zinta as an “A-list star” comparable to Julia Roberts or Renee Zellweger. “She seems to be more of a thinking person based on the roles she’s taken.”
Bijoy M. Misra, outreach coordinator of the department of Sanskrit and Indian studies, said he was pleased to hear that Zinta will be studying at the Business School. It may benefit film stars to develop business skills and to involve themselves in a more intellectual environment, he said.
Students in the South Asian community at Harvard also expressed their excitement for Zinta’s arrival.
“Her attendance really shows how relevant a business education can be in various industries and in a global context,” wrote Monica Sharma, co-president of the Business School’s South-Asian Business Association, in an e-mailed statement.

CORRECTION APPENDED
Tuesday’s Cambridge municipal elections were a landmark for the city, marked by the election of the first Asian-American City Councillor and the first write-in candidate, according to new results released by the Cambridge Election Commission yesterday.
Following a low budget, student focused campaign, Harvard Kennedy School student Leland Cheung became the first Asian-American and the first University student to be elected to the Council in recent memory.
Although she failed to turn in the necessary paperwork to get her name on the ballot, Marjorie C. Decker, who was first elected to the Council in 1999, still managed to earn enough votes to secure a sixth term on the nine-member Council.
“A lot of people in this community decided that the work I do is important,” Decker said.
Preliminary results announced Tuesday night predicted that incumbent Larry W. Ward and challenger Edward J. Sullivan had won seats on the Council. However, after the remaining 22 percent of ballots, including all the write in ballots, were counted, Vice Mayor Sam Seidel and Decker secured spots, while Ward and Sullivan did not.
Election results will not be officially confirmed until Nov. 13, when overseas and provisional ballots are counted.
Cheung’s campaign was also unique in that he spent the least of all the candidates elected. While Decker reported the highest campaign expenditures of any candidate—more than $57,000 as of Nov. 4—Cheung spent less than $5,000, according to reports compiled from the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance.
“I think what was special about it was that we reached out to the community at large, but also to the groups that are not normally courted,” said Michael E. Sherry, Cheung’s campaign manager.
The campaign, which emphasized improving public safety and increasing collaboration between the city and universities, sought the votes of students and Asian-Americans, Sherry said.
Voters responded positively to the campaign’s message of bringing a fresh voice to work alongside experienced councillors.
“Really the reason I ran was to bring other people’s ideas to life,” said Cheung, a joint student at Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management.
Ward, who joined the Council in March following the resignation of former Vice Mayor Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87, was the only current councillor who was not re-elected to the nine member legislative body.
The Cambridge City Council uses a unique and complicated election system in which voters rank nine candidates. Those who are ranked first on 10 percent of ballots are declared elected. Any extra ballots they receive beyond the 10 percent quota are redistributed to the candidates marked next in preference on those excess ballots, and the process continues until all nine seats are filled.
Nearly 16,000 ballots were cast this year, a 16 percent increase from the last municipal election.

CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Nov. 6 news article "Asian-American Elected to Council" incorrectly referred to Leland Cheung as a student at the Harvard Business School in one instance. In fact, Cheung is a student at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Facing two ECAC opponents this weekend, the Crimson men’s hockey team will attempt to replicate last week’s win over Dartmouth. Harvard (1-0, 1-0 ECAC) will face Colgate (2-2-3) tonight and archrival No. 5 Cornell (1-0) on Saturday.
The two New York road contests will be the first games away from the Bright Hockey Center this season. Last year, the Crimson went 0-11-5 away from home. With this in mind, the players acknowledge the added challenge of attaining victories this weekend.
“We’re just going to focus on playing strong and hard hockey,” sophomore forward Alex Killorn said. “It’s a little different playing away, but we’re just taking it game by game.”
The game against Cornell, one of the nation’s best teams, will take place in a sold out Lynah Rink. Contests with the Big Red have been historically tough. Last year, Harvard split with Cornell, losing 2-1 in Ithaca and capturing a 4-2 win in Cambridge.
While the Crimson men say they treat each game with equal importance, Saturday’s face-off with a long-time nemesis will demand a distinct effort from all fronts. Harvard defenseman will look to control dangerous attackers Colin Greening and Riley Nash, who was voted preseason All-ECAC. Cornell’s Ben Scrivens, among the nation’s best goaltenders, is also bound to be a strong force between the pipes.
Junior forward Michael Biega believes that the key to emerging victorious this weekend is controlling the flow of the game.
“We want to be able to dictate the speed of play, so we need to come out fast,” said Biega, who notched two assists last week.
Harvard started the ECAC schedule off strong, controlling play in the opening period against Dartmouth and holding a 13-5 shots-on-goal advantage. The squad showed offensive aggression all night, with Killorn leading the way with two goals. Richter remained solid in net, stopping 41 shots.
Captain Alex Biega called on all segments of the team to be effective this weekend.
“We have to use our speed offensively and take advantage of our defensemen,” Alex Biega said. “And we need to be strong on special teams and power plays.”
Last week against the Big Green, Harvard’s special teams were an essential part of the victory. The Crimson went two for three on the power play, while Dartmouth went one-for-four.
“The power play was the difference between winning and losing against Dartmouth, and it could quite possibly be a factor [again],” Alex Biega said.
Killorn’s second tally against the Big Green came on the power play. He shot a loose puck into the net after junior defenseman Chris Huxley centered it from the left side, and sophomore forward Daniel Moriarty deflected it to the right side, where Killorn was waiting.
“In tight games, [the powerplay] is huge,” Killorn said. “We don’t want to put them in power play too often, but if we get the opportunity, we’ll score some goals.”
Despite a highly anticipated Big Red contest, the Crimson emphasizes that they cannot look past Friday’s game against a Colgate team with an undeniable level of skill.
“They’re obviously a very strong team and they’ve played good teams so far,” Alex Biega said.
Colgate tied No. 15 Nebraska-Omaha on October 16th and lost to No. 13 University of Massachusetts at Lowell by two goals a week later.

One team came into the season with a veteran offense and the make-up of a dark horse Ivy League contender. The other came in with a title to defend and an untested quarterback. It was anyone’s guess who would still be undefeated at this point.
Despite how the season has played out, Harvard (5-2, 4-0 Ivy) cannot take Columbia (2-5, 1-3 Ivy) for granted this weekend. While the Lions’ record may not show it, the team is not short on talent on either side of the ball.
“They have a level of skill, athleticism, toughness…that you just can’t believe that it’s turned out the way it has so far for this team,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They were off to such a good start, so they’re a good football team.”
Coming into the season, Columbia looked like it would a title contender. At the start of the season, senior quarterback M.A. Olawale is a 6’1” and 224 lbs. looked poised to do damage throughout the Ancient Eight.
“He’s kind of a force of nature,” Murphy said. “He’s one of those guys you have to account for on every play.”
Harvard, on the other hand, looked to the less physically-imposing field general Collier Winters in his first year starting behind center.
Entering the eighth week of play, there seems to have been a role reversal.
Winters has emerged as a dependable play caller, and Olawale can no longer depend on a starting spot this Saturday.
That is, after freshman Sean Brackett passed for 180 yards and three touchdowns against Yale last weekend, Olawale’s significance to the team is questionable.
“[Brackett] played lights-out,” Murphy said.
What the Crimson has to take away from this is not that the Lions have been inconsistent, but that they have two different quarterbacks capable of explosive performances.
Either quarterback will have at its disposal a dangerous receiver in senior Austin Knowlin, who was selected last year as Second Team All-Ivy.
“It’s a tough offense,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “If you make mistakes, they’ll capitalize.”
The same could be said of the Lions’ defense, particularly of brothers Evan and Lou Miller. Lou, the elder sibling, is arguably one of the best defensive players in the league according to Murphy.
“He leads the team in both tackles for loss and in sacks,” Murphy said. “We call him the Tasmanian Devil because he has what we call in coaching such an unbelievable motor, he goes at an incredibly high speed and level of tenacity you can’t believe play after play after play.”
The Miller brothers should provide the running back duo of junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales with more of a challenge than Dartmouth.
Against the Big Green, the only uncertainty was which Crimson running back would amass more rushing yards; Scales, who had 120 on the day, edged out Gordon by one.
With such success on the ground, the Crimson’s passing game has seen less of the statistical spotlight.
“Making blocks is just as fun as getting the ball,” junior receiver Marco Iannuzzi said. “If you can run, there’s no reason to pass. It only becomes an issue when the running game’s not working.”
Murphy, meanwhile, would like to see Winters air the ball out a little more against the Lions.
“We said we’ve got to run the football more and better,” Murphy said. “Mission accomplished. I think we have to get back to the other balance. I don’t like throwing the ball only 17 times a game.”
Winters and the passing attack have been working dedicatedly all week to change that.
“The whole offense and defense stays after practice,” Iannuzzi said. “We get the dining hall to deliver food to the locker room and we stay and watch film.”
The preparation will assist the Crimson this weekend in forgetting all records and concentrating on the task at hand—shutting down a Lions team that presents a threat that cannot be overlooked.
“It’s going to be a hard game,” Ehrlich said. “Columbia always plays hard. We need to come out as hard. If we match that intensity, we should be able to come out with a win.”

In Game 6 of the World Series on Tuesday night, the New York Yankees held a 7-3 lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the top of the eighth inning with one out and no one on base. Lefty reliever Damaso Marte had been pitching masterfully, dealing consecutive strikeouts to the Phillies’ fearsome slugging duo of Chase Utley and Ryan Howard.
The game seemed well in hand, and even the most conservative of approaches would have likely led the Yankees to victory and their 27th World Championship. Instead, New York manager Joe Girardi signaled to the bullpen for Mariano Rivera.
Why, some wondered, would you stretch out the Greatest Closer of All-Time for a five-out save when you’re up by four and your opponent looks helpless against even your secondary relievers?
I’ll tell you why: Because when that ultimate victory—in the case of professional baseball, a World Series title—is within your sights, you don’t saunter towards it on cruise control. You crank up the intensity, step on your opponent’s throat, and finish the job.
It took Rivera a career-high 41 pitches to end the game, and he labored at times. But with a championship at stake, the Yankees weren’t going to play around and unleash their full arsenal only if they really needed it. They brought in their top gun, and they took the title on their own terms.
This is the approach that Harvard football needs to employ against Columbia tomorrow.
Once an Ivy League sleeper pick, the Lions have regressed after early success and are now fighting to stay out of the Ancient Eight basement. But it would be a mistake for the Crimson to take its trip to New York lightly. With its game against Penn, the Crimson’s dangerous companion atop the Ivy standings, looming in Week 9, Harvard needs to keep the momentum going and trounce Columbia the same way it plowed through Princeton and Dartmouth in its last two contests. The Crimson can beat the Lions without putting forth its best effort tomorrow, but the Quakers won’t be as forgiving.
Harvard has the ultimate victory—the Ivy League title—within its sights. It can try to get there on cruise control and hope fate decides in its favor. Or, like the Yankees, the Crimson can carve out its own path to glory, Mo-ing down its opponents along the way.
CORNELL (2-5, 1-3 IVY) AT DARTMOUTH (1-6, 1-3 IVY)
Despite the records of the teams involved, this game could be fun to watch. Both Cornell and Dartmouth bring an exciting mix to the equation: both offenses occasionally mask their general ineptitude with outstanding individual performances while both defenses could charitably be described as terrible.
The possibilities are endless.
Could the Big Green’s Nick Schweiger run for 300 yards? Could the Big Red’s Stephen Liuzza pick up a rushing, receiving, and passing touchdown all in the same game?
It’s almost impossible to talk yourself into getting pumped for either a Dartmouth or Cornell game. But a Dartmouth versus Cornell game? It’s almost impossible not to.
Prediction: Cornell 35, Dartmouth 28
BROWN (4-3, 2-2 IVY) AT YALE (4-3, 2-2 IVY)
Brown receiver Buddy Farnham’s reign of terror over the Ivy League finally came to an end last week against Penn. The valiant Quakers shed the mantle of pacifism and vanquished the tyrant Farnham—who in Weeks 5 and 6 oppressed Princeton and Cornell to the tune of a combined 19 catches for 406 yards. Penn held the Bears’ wideout to six receptions for 52 yards.
Yale also boasts a formidable pass defense—the league’s best, in fact—and could pose yet another challenge for Farnham and Brown, which relies heavily on its aerial attack.
The Bears would seem to be the favorite in this one despite the identical records of the two teams, but I like the stingy Bulldogs D and expect some timely throws from the resurgent Patrick Witt, who orchestrated Yale’s comeback win against Columbia last week after a stretch of limited and mediocre play.
Prediction: Yale 21, Brown 17
PRINCETON (2-5, 1-3 IVY) AT PENN (5-2, 3-0 IVY)
The current state of each of these teams nicely illustrates the idea that not all momentum is created equally. While Princeton snapped a four-game losing streak with a 17-13 victory over Cornell last week, Penn has won five in a row.
The Quakers should easily come away with the victory here, but might also benefit from heeding the advice I gave to Harvard by keeping their collective foot on the gas. The last thing Penn needs is a letdown against the Tigers before what will likely be the de facto Ivy League championship game in Week 9.
Prediction: Penn 28, Princeton 10
HARVARD (5-2, 3-0 IVY) AT COLUMBIA (2-5, 1-3 IVY)
If you read The Crimson’s sports page yesterday, you know that Harvard senior running back Cheng Ho has suffered what will most likely be a career-ending lisfranc (mid-foot) sprain. So while I have this space, I’d like to congratulate Ho on a fine tenure with the Crimson, one in which he performed whatever duty his team required of him and performed it well.
Prediction: Harvard 31, Columbia 17
Last Week: 2-2
Record to Date: 25-15

Just when we thought the College's illness paranoia was over. Today, a student in Eliot was diagnosed with a case of "probable chickenpox," according to an email sent by Eliot Resident Dean Michael Canfield.
FlyBy thinks it's  safe to say that most Harvard students have contracted chickenpox at some point in their lives or received the vaccination, making this small outbreak of little concern. However, the email urges those who are not immune—and who fall into a high-risk health category—to contact UHS immediately.
As a reminder, these are the symptoms to watch out for, courtesy of UHS:
We guess you can never stop being diligent about your health. Keep Purell-ing, and be well!

Look out, True Love Revolution, there's a new group in town...and they're competing for your initials. True Lust Revolution, founded by David E. Biery '10, may or may not be a serious addition to the Harvard Student Organizations list, but it is making a statement--at least over the Cabot House open list.
According to an email sent by Biery, "the goals of the club are still being developed," but he later states further down in the email chain that TLR-the-second has managed to attract at least 10 members, and that the next project will be to develop t-shirts, since "every good organization has free t-shirts."
Although Biery does not state it specifically, other responses to the email imply that this new group's presence may be in retaliation against the original TLR, which has been the subject of  several articles in the Crimson editorial section over the past several weeks. The debate has continued on the TLR blog. See what one respondent to Biery's recent e-mail wrote, after the jump:

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and some other schools too).
A Yale sophomore died last Sunday.  Andre Narcisse '12—an Exeter graduate and aspiring Economics concentrator of Haitian descent—dreamed of someday becoming a Wall Street executive. Yale police officials do not suspect foul play.  Yale College Dean Mary Miller told the Yale Daily News that it would be premature and inappropriate to speculate, but added she is hoping to address concerns about alcohol and drug use on campus.
A freshman at Princeton is suing the university during midterm season, after her request to receive extended time on exams because of her learning disabilities was denied. She argued that poor midterm exam grades freshman fall would cause her “irreparable harm.” FlyBy sympathizes but thinks she should chill out.
More after the jump.
Yale's business school has surpassed Harvard Business School in placing their students in full-time jobs within three months of graduation. It now stands at number one among the country's business schools. Penn's Wharton School, however, has suffered more, with only 83 percent of graduates securing full-time jobs, as opposed to 95 percent for the graduating years from 2005 to 2008.
Stanford stem cell researchers are poised to receive $52 million from California's stem cell research agency.
A 32-year-old horticulture graduate student at Cornell died unexpectedly.
And two Yale dining hall workers also passed away suddenly.
