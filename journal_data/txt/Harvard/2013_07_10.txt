After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SANTIAGO, Chile - When it comes to protesting, Chilean students have us beat.
Where we’ll hold a vigil, they’ll start a riot. Where we’ll camp out on Harvard Yard, they’ll violently sack a university building.
This is a lesson I learned on Tuesday afternoon while covering a student march for an expat paper in Santiago. Organized by FECH, Universidad de Chile’s student union, these ‘marches’ feature thousands of protestors demanding dramatic reforms to the nation’s broken school system.
I put ‘march’ in quotation marks because the label incorrectly implies peace, order, and nonviolence. In reality, all sense of decorum is typically lost by 10:30 in the morning — about a half an hour after the demonstrations begin. A student will throw a rock at the carbinieros; the carbinieros, clad in riot gear, retaliate. The escalatory spiral continues, and soon no one can walk three blocks in the city’s central borough without skirting a flaming barricade or witnessing a violent confrontation with the law.
By 2 p.m that Tuesday — when I arrived at the corner of Avenidas Santa María and Loreta — the scene was surreal. That’s a cliché adjective, used nowadays to describe everything from tasty meals to pretty views.  But this was one of those rare cases, in which the descriptor was completely appropriate.
Where there had been fruit vendors and outdoor cafés and children playing in the street the previous day, there was now a mass of students, trying to push past a police cordon. Punches were exchanged. A noise bomb was thrown to disperse the crowd.
In the middle of the pandemonium sat a black police tank, spraying a mixture of water and tear gas from a swiveling turret.  Though it was easy enough to avoid a direct hit, just loitering near the fumes produced the feeling of pepper in the eyes and sandpaper on the skin.
A group of encapuchados, or masked anarchists, had taken advantage of the disorder. Unaffiliated with the students, their one goal is chaos — rubble fires set in the street, shattered windows, illicit graffiti, smashed up sidewalks.
In this atmosphere, it was easy to denounce the protestors. Many conservative politicians make a living doing so.
After all, the vendors whose properties were destroyed had no dog in this fight.
But it’s also easy to forget that the students are not the encapuchados — a distinction that Chile’s right attempts, with some success, to blur.
It’s easy to forget that the basic idea of meritocracy is at stake; whereas scholarships, endowments, and grants have brought a college education within reach of most students in the United States, the Pinochet-era relic of for-profit universities — a topic too complex to explain at length here — has made tertiary education the realm only of the rich in Chile.
Finally — and most importantly — it’s easy to forget that the protests have worked.
In the presidential debates in late June, all four candidates from the Concertación bloc — the dominant coalition in Chilean politics — pledged to wean the educational system from profit. The two more liberal contenders of the group want no one to pay out of pocket, while the more conservative candidates want the richest 30 percent to make a small contribution — perhaps not FECH’s dream, but not far off either.
These positions were considered fringe four years ago; now, they’re de rigeur for any serious presidential contender, and this is largely due to the attention the students have brought to the issue.
At Harvard, we can get riled up over a cause just like the Chilean students — whether it be mental health or divestment. Though the injustices we fight against are no longer as flagrant as those in Santiago, they’re flagrant enough to spark collective movements, some with popular support.
So I suppose in principle, our protests in similar. In practice, however, they’re anything but.
Whereas FECH protests cause both collateral damage and profound change, ours cause neither. Whereas, our movements fizzle out and eventually implode, FECH’s protest are explosive, sometimes quite literally.
I’m not sure either strategy is unqualifiedly better — both have their upsides and downsides. But if there’s one lesson that could be gleaned for our generation at Harvard — far removed from the anti-war movements of the ‘60s and ‘70s, and almost always willing to obey our administrators — it might be that the most effective activism is often performed not within the institutional framework, but in opposition to it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON DC, USA—On my first night in D.C., a family member takes me up to National Cathedral. From then on, I'll use the Cathedral's towers to orient myself in an unfamiliar city: at the right angle, they appear unexpectedly in a skyline that still makes no sense from the ground.
That night the summer’s humidity hasn’t yet kicked in, and the air is getting cool, the Cathedral’s distant silhouette imposing against a setting sun. We follow the sound of its bells across the city and into the parking lot, where the echoes reverberate through and out of the building, suddenly tangible and thick.
The pinnacles of the central tower are still secured from scaffolding, damaged after a 5.8 magnitude two summers ago shook up stone, and its metal beams poke into the sky.
Inside, past the pews, we get on an elevator—it’s tiny and old, with manual doors of metal grates—and speed upward past the stained glass windows, into one of the cathedral’s slim towers. Up another spiral staircase, a small group inside the bell-ringing chamber pulls on the ropes connected to the Cathedral’s ten bells in a room above.
The ropes shoot up, then down, the noise projected outward so much greater than the person holding the cord—thousands of pounds of metal between two palms.
Bell-ringing is less abstract than that, though; it's strictly mathematical. Songs are written out with numbers that indicate the order in which each bell should be rung. Ringers perform the complex patterns from memory, guiding the bells through a 360-degree rotation while coordinating with the others, and if they mess up, it’s no well-kept secret: An entire city hears.
But from below, I think, you never think about the hands that project music into the grid of the streets, the systems that keep a city in time. The sun disappears like it always does, and the bells stop when it hits 9:00.

CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom—As we crossed the bridge into Cambridge on the fourth of July, my Harvard compatriots began shouting “America the Beautiful.”
“Oh my god,” I thought. “I’m one of them – part of an obnoxious gang of American college students terrorizing cities across Europe.”
I clutched my purse and prayed the passing horde of British teens would leave us alone.
Being abroad on the fourth of July is a tricky thing, but being in the U.K. feels especially fraught.  After all, my colonial ancestors whupped these guys way back in the eighteenth century, right?  It seems a bit crass to celebrate.
Leave it to the Brits to rub it all back in our faces.
“Tomorrow night we are celebrating the independence of our friends across the pond with arguably their greatest export,” read a Facebook post for the event we were attending.  “FRAT PARTY BABY! Expect jello shots, red cups, shot limbo and classic Frat Party games!”
America, God shed his grace on thee.  So off we Yankees went, descending upon a bar aptly named “Revolution” and eventually making it upstairs to the frat party.  Lipstick-ed, teetering women writhed alongside men inexplicably dressed in fanciful costumes (camoflauge, royal regalia, possibly a Crayon?), all beneath garlands of American flags.
Looking back, I should’ve been tipped off by the portrait of Lenin.
That’s right, folks – our ‘Murica-loving British friends had staged their fourth of July event in a Communist-themed bar.  I started noticing Soviet references and an ample use of red.  The frat party itself was going down next to a “Revolución de Cuba” sign.
However, it looked like most partygoers, British and American, cared more about the jello shots than the irony.  Some things transcend all rivalries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Cambridge mayor Henrietta J. Davis announced Monday that she will not seek reelection to the City Council in November, a decision that likely brings to an end her 26-year career as a Cambridge elected official.
 
In a written statement, Davis, 68, expressed her gratitude to the people of Cambridge for giving her “the opportunity to serve” for 18 years on the City Council, including two as mayor, and before that, for eight years on the Cambridge School Committee.
 
“After thirteen successful elections I’m putting away my yard signs and leaving the campaign events to others,” she wrote. “I will miss walking up and down our beautiful streets and the face-to-face meetings with Cambridge residents at their homes and hearing their ideas and concerns.”
 
Davis also wrote that she plans to remain civically active in the city.
 
“I’ll still be fighting for equity and opportunity for all Cambridge citizens (especially young people), and making sure Cambridge continues to become a model for a healthy, sustainable city, and a community that is welcoming and supportive to all our residents,” wrote Davis, who made environmental sustainability and child welfare and education central tenets of her political agenda.
 
Davis was first elected to the Cambridge School Committee in 1987 after working as an administrator at the Agassiz Preschool in Somerville. In 1995, she was elected to the City Council, and in subsequent Council elections Davis trumpeted the work she did on the School Committee to improve schoolchildren’s access to vaccinations as well as her vision for a greener Cambridge.
 
In February 2012, Davis was elected to the mayoralty by her colleagues on the City Council following weeks of political gridlock. Her term as mayor ends in 2014.
 
Seven of the current nine City Councillors are expected to run for reelection this November. In addition to Davis, Councillor Marjorie C. Decker has said that she does not plan to run—Decker was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2012 and at that time made it clear that if elected to the Legislature, she would not seek reelection to the Council.
 
Currently, there are 22 total candidates contesting for the nine City Council positions. Among them is a Harvard College student, Logan E. Leslie ’16, who is campaigning on a promise to bridge the town-gown divide.
