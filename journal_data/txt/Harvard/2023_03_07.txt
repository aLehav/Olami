After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maxine B. Gordon is building a new perspective on jazz history. In her upcoming book, “Quartette: Stories from the Lives of Four Women Jazz Musicians—Maxine Sullivan, Velma Middleton, Melba Liston, and Shirley Scott” Gordon weaves together Black feminist thought, studious archivism, and a lifetime on the jazz scene to create a window into the lives and careers of four remarkable musicians.
An oral historian and archivist with a Master’s degree in African Diaspora History from New York University, Gordon is currently a Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
“The big gift is time to think … and read,” Gordon said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson regarding her fellowship at Radcliffe. “It’s really valuable.”
Her love for both jazz and the musicians who perform it is obvious, and shines through in her discerning, convivial demeanor.
As a teenager growing up in New York City, Gordon spent her Fridays in the underage listening section at famous jazz club, The Village Vanguard where she even befriended the owner. Her experience there was merely the beginning of a long love affair between Gordon and jazz.
As a young woman, Gordon worked as a road manager, spending months on the road with bands. Later, she married famed Jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon. After her husband passed away in 1990, Gordon began working on his biography, which led her down a fascinating, winding path of African American studies. On this journey, she met archivist mentors, organized three Library of Congress collections, and became the senior interviewer and jazz researcher for the Bronx African American Research Project.
Finally, in 2018, “Sophisticated Giant: The Life and Legacy of Dexter Gordon” was published. The book weaves together many different facets including pieces in Gordon’s husband’s voice since Dexter began writing his autobiography before his death. The book also incorporates aspects of history, music, research, and anecdotes to create an astounding piece of work which raked in various awards, including the Book of the Year 2019 from the Jazz Journalists Association and the Timothy White Award for Outstanding Music Biography from the ASCAP Foundation.
Before the writing of “Sophisticated Giant: The Life and Legacy of Dexter Gordon” was even complete, Gordon was already looking ahead to “Quartette: Four Women in Jazz, Stories from the Lives of Four Women Jazz Musicians.” One of the four women she is researching, Shirley Scott, was not only a phenomenal musician, but a close friend of Gordon’s for many years.
Indeed, Shirley Scott, Maxine Sullivan, Velma Middleton, and Melba Liston are ever-present in her office. Stunning photos of the musicians fill a whiteboard, and their names dress the swath of brown paper that decorates the wall across from her desk.
Gordon learned the practice of planning on sheets of brown paper from her archivist mentor Annie Keubler. Gordon met Keubler while she was working as the head archivist at the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University in Newark. Gordon went to see a Mary Lou Williams archive that Keubler was working with and they became quick friends.
Gordon spoke fondly of her friend and mentor, who passed in 2012: “She inspired me, and she kept saying, ‘Oh, you have a talent for this.’” Gordon took to archiving quickly, and adopted her friend’s fondness for brown paper sheets, a roll of which sits in the corner of Gordon’s office. She said that in Keubler’s workroom, “she had these rolls of brown paper … like, all around … that’s how she worked the archive, by sorting, but by using the paper and crossing out stuff and moving.” This dynamic and engaged physical approach reflects the conceptual approach Gordon takes to her research, exemplified by her notion of jazz geography.
Inspired by the influences of Sylvia Wynter, Katherine McKittrick and Clyde Woods’s book “Black Geographies and the Politics of Place,” as well as by the work of her mentor Robert Farris Thompson, Gordon has put together the concept of jazz geography as an innovative lens through which she is able to analyze her research subjects. In addition to pulling from Black feminist thought and her intimate knowledge of the process of musical touring, jazz geography was galvanized when Gordon went on a book tour for “Sophisticated Giant: The Life and Legacy of Dexter Gordon.”
“I did 65,000 miles for the tour. I tracked the mileage … and that was when I started thinking about jazz geography,” she said.
The influence of place became sharply relevant to her. Two of the subjects of her upcoming book had careers that revolved around touring: Velma Middleton toured for almost 20 years with Louis Armstrong and Melba Liston accompanied Dizzy Gillespie on a well known tour of the Middle East. Gordon is digging into the role location played in not just the careers and lives of the musicians she studies, but also all those they touched while on tour.
Gordon’s connection to the jazz musicians in her books is not merely that of researcher and subject: She brings a profound sense of engaged biographical scholarship that grants a rich sense of vibrancy to her work. Gordon’s unique perspective as a cultural archivist with a lifetime of experience in music and a deep-seated love for jazz imbues both her presence and her writing with a special sense of wisdom and star power. Radcliffe and Harvard are lucky to have this incredible woman spending her time here — life is just a little more mellifluous when Maxine B. Gordon is on the scene.

Hannah Whitten’s “The Foxglove King” — an immersive and captivating fantasy novel full of death magic and powerful dead gods — will keep readers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. Fraught with angsty tension, razor-sharp wit, mind-blowing plot twists, and a love triangle that develops into a forbidden slow-burn romance, the first novel of Whitten’s “The Nightshade Crown” trilogy hits all the right notes.
The novel’s protagonist, 23-year-old Lore, is wonderfully sarcastic and powerful — yet her mindset and reactions are still relatable. Lore is forced to hide her Mortem abilities, or death magic, by being a poison runner and spy. But she soon finds herself in trouble as her magic is exposed and she is forced to do the bidding of the king and his powerful religious force. Despite her story, which is filled with tragedy, pain, and betrayal, her wit keeps the reader laughing. Lore’s entertaining internal dialogue keeps the story lighthearted even in its darkest moments.
The romance in “The Foxglove King” is more than just a simple love story — it’s a complicated affair that adds a layer of tension to the plot. Lore finds herself caught in a love triangle, or perhaps even a love square, that will make readers eagerly await its resolution. The forbidden nature of the romance adds another layer of complexity to the story, making it all the more compelling.
Whitten’s worldbuilding in “The Foxglove King” is truly immersive and enchanting. The city of Dellaire is vividly depicted, with its sprawling streets and labyrinth of catacombs. The author takes the time to describe the culture and customs of the city's inhabitants, from the elites’ elaborate clothing to the gritty underworld of the poison runners. Laying out the foundations of a world can sometimes be boring and hard to stay interested in; however, the construction of Whitten’s world is truly engaging, with the addition of incredibly active scenes that keep readers’ hearts pounding. Whitten’s attention to detail in crafting her world makes it feel fully realized and tangible, transporting readers straight into the heart of the story.
In addition to its romantic subplots and magic, “The Foxglove King” also provides excellent social commentary relevant to today’s world. The story’s setting, Dellaire, is a city filled with a small group of elites and a large group of common peasants. The elites throw pompous, over-the-top parties and hoard their wealth, paying a smaller amount in taxes than the commoners who can barely eat. Even more outrageously, they also use their wealth to guarantee themselves good spots in the afterlife, while the poor are condemned to eternal suffering due to the outrageous costs of a proper burial. The inequalities present in Whitten’s fictional city clearly present a biting criticism of real-world elites, adding another realistic layer to the story.
Finally, one caution for readers: Read Whitten’s provided content warnings before picking up “The Foxglove King.” This story is full of dark themes and gory details, all of which are spelled out in Whitten’s list.
With its captivating worldbuilding, compelling characters, and unexpected twists, “The Foxglove King” is a must-read for fantasy fans. Lore’s sarcastic wit and powerful magic make her a joy to read about, the romantic subplots add a layer of tension to the story, and the social commentary is both timely and thought-provoking. Overall, “The Foxglove King” is a thrilling and unforgettable read that will stay with readers long after they’ve turned the final page.

Not only is “From the Andes to the Caribbean: American Art from the Spanish Empire” the first major exhibit curated by Horace D. Ballard, the Theodore E. Stebbins Jr. Associate Curator of American Art: The exhibit’s Mar. 3 debut also marked The Harvard Art Museums’ first dual exploration of religious and secular art of the Spanish Americas.
“From the Andes to the Caribbean” presents 50 objects ranging from paintings from Bolivia, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela, to materials like Mexican cochineal, Peruvian silver, and Honduran mahogany. 26 of the displayed paintings are shared from the Carl & Marilynn Thoma Foundation collection, while the others are drawn from Harvard Art Museums’ own collections, exhibiting an expansive view of the art and artists of the Spanish Americas.
Gallery materials are presented in multiple languages, with the language of the maker offered before its English translation, giving proper voice to the artists and narratives historically muted.
The exhibit opens first with its oldest work — a resplendent portrait of the Virgin Mary attributed to Mateo Pérez de Alesio (1589-1616), the High Renaissance influence palpable in the composition. The work points not only to European influence, but to the African diasporic histories the exhibit works to amplify: After Pérez de Alesio completed his assistance in the painting of the Sistine Chapel, he began instructing Afro-Indigenous workers in the Americas on the painting of icons. The painted icon’s beauty — Ballard notes — is complex and deeply political. In fact, Mary takes on further political significance and new skin tones in her subsequent appearances across the gallery.
The newest piece in the gallery, a vivid oil depiction of Saint Isidore the Farmer dressed as a 19th century gentleman, is deliberately placed along a nearby sight line from the oldest. The paintings invite the viewer into a curated conversation which dives into the first theme of the exhibition: the political and spiritual impact of Catholic icons.
Visible from both bays of the gallery, the exhibit’s next theme set along the back wall gives voice to syncretic identities. A key piece comes in the form of Diego Antonio de Landaeta’s 1763 small-scale portrait of Petronila Méndez, which holds significance as being his only extant work, as well as the only known portrait of a child in colonial Venezuela. In the midst of complex visual discussions of hybrid identities, the portrait brings this idea to an accessible human scale in its depiction of the young girl’s playful spirit.
The adjacent bay explores traded materials like copper, silver, gold, mahogany, and cochineal, as well as their uses in domestic objects and art, providing a poignant commentary on the triangulation between wealth, luxury, and labor. An imposing posthumous portrait of Nicholas Boylston, which previously hung in Harvard’s University Hall, points to colonial Boston and the Boylston family’s role in the trade and processing of the materials on display.
For Ballard, it was deeply important that the colors featured on the walls of the gallery align with the themes each section represents. For example, the first bay, featuring works with notes of religious politics, is swathed in a cochineal red color. Not only do the works displayed beg to be set against vibrantly colored walls as they would have in their original settings, the red connotes the pain and spilt blood resultant from the complexities of religion to which the works attest.
The second section, in contrast, antagonizes the construction of white supremacy by placing works on hybrid and syncretic identities against a stark white wall. By mixing Venezuelan, Peruvian, Bolivian, and Ecuadorian works in a stand against deeply embedded constructs of white supremacy, Ballard hopes to deconstruct post-colonial suppositions and emphasize that ethnicity and race as distinct concepts.
A cooler, more intimate teal tone was selected for the domestically-oriented displays of the second bay, which is home to the third theme of wealth, luxury, and labor. The sloping curves of fine mahogany works, glint of Potosí silver coins, and portrait gazes of major American players in trade systems reflect both the intimate notes of domesticity and the somber tones of colonialism and enslaved labor.
In addition to the exhibit’s striking color-coding, visitors are confronted with a recurring theme of syncopated arches which punctuate individual moments in the gallery for each work. The arches manifest exhibit designer Madelyn Albright’s desire to evoke Romanesque and Rococo architecture in the Americas while simultaneously paying homage to the architectural themes of the museums’ own courtyard. According to Ballard, the connection invoked by the arches is intentional. While adding texture to the gallery’s composition, the arches leverage the connection between Spanish colonial architectural forms and those in Harvard’s existing museum space to prompt questions and critiques of Harvard’s own history.
It’s these thoughtfully curated critiques which powerfully reset the table of American art and artists. Ballard’s first exhibition provokes a compelling reframing of the understanding of American art history, steering its origins away from the pilgrims and toward the Spanish Empire.
“From the Andes to the Caribbean: American Art from the Spanish Empire” is on view through Jul. 30 in the Special Exhibitions Gallery.

SZA unmistakably embodies the future of R&B — her “SOS Tour” serves as evidence of her innate ability to transform an album into art.
For the sixth show of her “SOS Tour” at Boston’s TD Garden on Feb. 28, SZA brought her acclaimed second studio album of the same name to life. The St. Louis native’s recent album has amassed chart-topping success since its release on Dec. 9, debuting as No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for seven consecutive weeks, in addition to three additional weeks in late February. SZA, along with winning Billboard’s Woman of Year, is one of eight artists to ever have an album at No. 1 for ten weeks and currently holds the most weeks at No. 1 for a female artist in nearly seven years.
The SOS tour brings listeners along a voyage of SZA’s relationship with self acceptance, heartbreak, and love. Following the natural ebbs and flows of the waves that adorn her album cover, SZA’s sound is dynamic and complex. She expands the boundaries of traditional R&B albums, incorporating different genres and displaying an openness to experiment and explore. This approach also transforms her album into a performance to be remembered.
Immersing the Garden in flowing, blue waves of light, SZA began the show stunning the audience, projecting a captivating self portrait amongst a vast ocean to perfectly accompany her melodic vocals to “PSA.” SZA, by plunging into the ocean around her mere moments after the concert began, cemented an air of electricity and excitement that didn’t leave the stadium until her last number.
The production design was highlighted by the nautical theme and maritime aesthetic of “SOS,” allowing each song to draw fans into the enthralling visuals. Simply put, SZA had control of her audience like no other.
For the next track, SZA emerged from the ocean singing “Seek & Destroy” on top of a rusty sailboat. Despite the set’s seemingly dark aesthetic, the Garden never felt so lively. As SZA sang, she accompanied her rhythmic melody to an eye-catching sequence of smooth dancing and swaying, highlighting both the calming nature of her album and the talent of her notably diverse crew of dancers.
Continuing her galvanizing start, SZA never remained stagnant, ensuring that each act was as lively as the last. SZA’s dedication to maintaining an exhilarating momentum was epitomized in her performance — albeit in a nontraditional fashion — of “Smoking on My Ex Pack.” Despite needing an outfit change, SZA never left the audience’s line of sight; instead, as her team changed her clothes backstage, she could still be seen on a screen hitting each lyric of the song. SZA’s stunning look in the grayscale camera filter and her unique backstage performance added a phenomenally dynamic contrast to her other songs that exceeded expectations.
From her setlist, two songs stand out amongst the rest: “Kill Bill” and “Good Days.” “Kill Bill,” being one of the most popular songs SZA has released to date, was phenomenal on stage. While singing the lyrics “I might kill my ex,” SZA approached the stage using the chained mace weapon from the film “Kill Bill Volume:1” to attack the figures behind her. SZA, most literally, packed the biggest punch of the night to form the excellent display of pain and defensiveness that brought her violent lyrics to life. With the screen behind her slowly filling with blood, her excellently crafted choreography meshed together with the setting to create an eye-catching and descriptive story of the meaning behind “Kill Bill.”
SZA’s artistic expressions did not wane for her closing song. “Good Days” painted a compelling portrait of the beauty of SZA’s lyrics through the most impressive visuals of the night. An ever-changing, intergalactic sunset created the stunning background to SZA sitting on the diving board from her performance of the first song. The full-circle ending gave a fulfilling close to the non-stop night.
From reminiscent additions to the setlist, such as “Kiss Me More” and “All the Stars,” to serenading the audience while floating around the stadium on a boat, SZA’s adept performance was an unforgettable voyage through her album and a meaningful glimpse into the emotions tied to each song.
When speaking about the meaningfulness of her tour, SZA talked about being grateful for her successes and the involvement that embracing love has in her life and in the lives of others.
“The love that we have for ourselves and that we pour out to each other is what makes all the difference.”

After 10 student performances — interspersed with jokes, skits, and raffle drawings — bands Beacon Street and Weld 16 emerged victorious in the Battle for Yardfest 2023 in Sanders Theatre on March 2. At Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring concert in Tercentenary Theatre, these two student bands will be the openers for a professional headliner who has yet to be announced. Audience votes determined one winner while a panel of four judges, including Dean Nekesa C. Straker, chose the other.
Beacon Street is a six-member band that opened the battle with covers of Men at Work’s “Down Under” and Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name,” after which they left the stage to chants of their band name. Reunited after a three year hiatus, Beacon Street spins a larger-than-life story of success, split, and comeback in their Battle for Yardfest Instagram biography.
Rock cover band Weld 16’s career began with jam sessions in their namesake freshman dorm. The group performed Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody” and Walk the Moon’s “Shut Up and Dance,” inspiring a mini mosh pit in the first row. Singer Ethan P. Hsiao ’26 ended their set with a split.
Weld 16, many of whom had little performance experience, found winning surreal.
“I think I can speak for everyone when I say that none of us expected it,” said Hsiao.
“Flabbergasted is the word,” added guitarist Kainoa S. Paul ’26.
Although the College Events Board (CEB) usually reveals the Yardfest headliner during the Battle for Yardfest, it has not announced this year’s yet. Last year, student bands Yard Bops and Charles Revival — both of which competed in this year’s Battle for Yardfest — opened for singer, songwriter, and rapper Swae Lee. Other past headliners include Kiiara, Bazzi, Lil Yachty, and Wale. Along with live festival-style performances, Yardfest includes block parties and a giant cookout.
Other competing acts of the competition included — along with the respective 2023 winners and 2022 defending champions — Into the AM, Williams*, STRYK9, Indigo, Alex Aldrich, and Wesley. Ranging from cover bands to solo singers to a DJ, they elicited enthusiastic applause, cheering, and chanting throughout the evening. Over the course of the night, Isa E. Peña ’24 of Yard Bops belted the Weather Girls’ “It’s Raining Men” between two backup dancers, Wesley R. Wang ’26 kept the audience guessing during a pop song mashup, and Williams T. Goldsmith ’26 struck up a call-and-answer: “When I say Gilliams you say Billiams!”
Into the AM guitarist Rachel K. Chau ’23 said of her fellow acts, “[To] hear them and cheer for them, it was super fun not even just on the stage but also backstage.”
Between acts, the two CEB hosts introduced “celebrity guest” Kermit the Frog, voiced by a puppeteer, and the satirical Harvard Whistler’s Society, a group of five who whistled to orchestral backing tracks. Kermit’s staged murder of a Whistler prompted a virtuosic solo whistling elegy.
In the raffle, two audience members won Coop merchandise and one student won a backstage pass to Yardfest.
Reflecting on the battle, the performers shared a sense of fast-paced fun. “Just the feeling of performing onstage with your roommates and some of your best mates is pretty tough to beat,” said Bradley H. Shearer ’26 of Weld 16.

When one thinks of the ideal amateur detective, none of Vera Wong's unique qualities — like repeatedly tampering with evidence and romantically setting up two of her suspects together — would come to mind. But when the elderly tea shop owner, who watches an unhealthy amount of “NCIS,” suddenly finds a dead body in her shop, she determines that she’s the only one who can solve the case. This kicks off Jesse Sutanto’s “Vera Wong’s Unsolicited Advice for Murderers,” a novel that delivers on its promise of a quirky, comedic mystery. “Vera Wong” showcases Sutanto’s skill at creating hilarious and empathetic characters. Ultimately, Vera's characterization is what holds the book together, even when the corniness of its plot sometimes becomes too much to bear.
The writing in “Vera Wong” is very eccentric, with humor ranging from dry to absurd. Vera carries the book’s humor, shown during moments such as when she sends her son, Tilly, a TikTok and tells him to “slip and slide” into the girl’s dms. She also isn’t above taking unorthodox steps to solve the murder either, as she tampers with evidence multiple times and straight up tells those she suspects that they’re on her suspect list. The book’s ability to poke fun at itself allows the reader to laugh both at and with its characters. The humor truly shines in the novel’s most intense scenes, injecting moments of levity into heavy situations, such as the gentrification that threatens Vera's tea shop.
Throughout the novel, Sutanto uses Vera’s teahouse as an example of gentrification. As compared to the popular coffee shop that is run by non-locals, Vera’s shop is only frequented by one customer, and she opens her shop daily just to sit and wait until closing. Not only does Sutanto showcase the deterioration of Vera’s hope that the shop will eventually succeed, she also showcases the physical decline of the shop itself, which is being slowly taken over by yellowing posters and grime. Though the social commentary isn’t subtle in the least, its overtness drives Sutanto’s point home as she demonstrates the physical and mental effects of gentrification.
However, while the novel’s humor and imagery pulls the reader into the story, her constant pop culture references and inclusion of Gen Z slang pulls them right out. Having Vera make pop-culture references — like to the reality dating TV show "Love Is Blind" — makes sense, since it showcases her attempts to appear more young as she grapples with issues of ageism. But the other younger characters also frequently use pop-culture references and slang in a way that is decidedly cringe-worthy. Take, for example, when Julia, the wife of the deceased in the teashop, mentions that her charcuterie boards “absolutely slay.” It's unclear if the inclusion of the references and slang were attempts at humor or Sutanto’s attempt to ground her novel in the present. But either way the attempt goes sour, as most of Sutanto’s references have already gone out of style, ultimately aging the book itself.
Overall, though Sutanto sometimes leans too far into the corniness of the book through unfunny jokes and outdated references, the heart of the story still shines through. She creates her own pocket in the mystery genre, shining light on relevant issues today. Vera represents those who are rarely remembered by society, and Sutanto makes her into someone who will be hard to ever forget.

Ana Breznik ’24 believes in experimental theater — in daring to go “outside of the convention” and taking “a step that people may question.” According to Breznik, an artistic idea worth pursuing — whether related to directing, costume, design, or another element — “scares you a little.”
“I just love the feeling when you see a show and you’re like, what the fuck did I just see?” Breznik said. “I just think it’s something that we need as humans.”
In her time on campus, Breznik has auditioned for a wide range of productions, including Shakespearean drama, conventional plays, and musical theater.
“But somehow, every year, the ‘weird show’ of the semester somehow pulls me in,” she said.
In fall 2021, her first in-person semester, Breznik performed in “Ubu Roi,” a 19th-century absurdist play by Alfred Jarry, staged on the steps of the Widener Library. The next semester, she performed in “Disonia,” a play publicized in email newsletters sent to students as “the most insane production of the season.”
Although she is drawn to the “weird,” Breznik carries her bold visions with a calm and meditative presence: She speaks softly and smiles often. Breznik is originally from Slovenia, one of the smallest countries in Europe, where a person could drive from one end to the other in just a few hours. She grew up in a village with, as she said, about five hundred residents, with a church, three bars, and one store. However, she went to school in Maribor, the second-largest city in Slovenia.
“The earliest form of art I was involved in by myself was ballet,” Breznik said. “It was actually my dream in middle school to become a ballerina.”
She started dancing at age six and continued for nine years. However, the intense training eventually caused a back injury, which forced her to quit ballet. While she turned her attention to theater, her ballet foundation still influences her approach to and understanding of the performing arts.
“I still understand theater primarily through movement.” she said. “I'm very interested in conveying the story and emotion with as little words as possible, rather with other elements of theatrical storytelling, such as movement, music, lighting.”
“I came in thinking I was going to do a lot of science,” Breznik said. “But art is beginning to take more and more time as Harvard goes on.”
Breznik pursues a concentration in Integrative Biology with a secondary field in Theater, Dance, and Media. When she came to Harvard, she thought she would only focus on science — but she spends increasingly more time on art. She does not consider the two disciplines in stark opposition; rather, she finds science and art “more connected” than most people often believe.
“They’re both a process of exploration and searching for answers,” Breznik said. “As you find some answers you think of new questions. They just have very different ways of going about it. At the core, they’re just this beautiful, never-ending cyclical process of never fully getting the answer.”
Since coming to the United States, Breznik has appreciated the popularity of the theater market, but also recognized that this popularity often causes productions to focus on profit.
“I sometimes really miss […] boldness and daringness. I feel like all the shows are made to be liked, rather than questioned or talked about. And so I really want to bring more experimental theater to Harvard,” she said.
Breznik has been working on “Museum of Tenderness,” an experimental play dealing with loneliness, connection, and finding tenderness with the self.
“Museum of Tenderness” began last spring, when she took Directing Lab, a course taught by Shira Milikowsky where students directed scenes. She found something exciting in “starting from scratch” and developing her own vision. She expanded the two scenes originally created for Directing Lab to seven scenes. Breznik calls these scenes “dreams” because they lie “on the edge” of the “conscious, unconscious, and subconscious.”
The dreams are akin to “a collection of short stories” that stand alone but are connected through an overarching theme. Breznik also acts in the play.
“I think a good scene will always tell something about the director,” she said. “So I think directing myself into [the first] scene kind of speaks to that. And that scene is about accepting parts of yourself that exist within you, that you sometimes like to push down.”
Breznik said that there are many “unknowns” and “puzzle pieces” that she has to work through and put together. She has found it difficult to create a campus production as an independent artist, but she has also found other students who are passionate about the arts and excited to help with the production.
“Museum of Tenderness” is personal to Breznik. She found the process of creating it and seeing it performed as “healing.”
“My scenes have a lot of the components that I sometimes miss in my own life, but which I strive to implement,” said Breznik. “There's something quite meditative about my process of writing the scenes.”
Breznik strives to see more people embrace compassion and understanding and aims to bring these values to audiences through theater. During a preview of two scenes from “Museum of Tenderness,” Breznik saw her audience connect and relate to universal emotions that “we often like to hide.”
“Tenderness is something that we should always strive for in life… Force doesn't really get us anywhere,” Breznik said. “Among students at Harvard, everyone is always very strict with themselves. A lot of the time, people beat themselves up over the smallest things. And I think remembering to be gentle and patient with yourself is always helpful, healthy, and makes you better at everything you do. And also makes you a better person.”
Experimental theater may hold connotations with the bold and uncomfortable, but Breznik focuses on connection — by pursuing the ideas that scare her a little, she reminds people to stay in touch with their tenderness.

“Making it” in the restaurant business has been the main concern of restaurateurs for the past several years, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. It seems as if each new restaurant tries to top the one that came before it in its exploratory flavors, experiences, and ambience. But the James Beard Foundation (JBF) looks past restaurant industry theatrics and awards restaurant owners for what really matters: food and service. The most recent winners of the award were announced on Feb. 22, and their wins are a reminder of the impact of locally-made food on the community that enjoys it.
The James Beard Foundation was created in the spirit of the chef and food-lover James Beard to “celebrate, support, and elevate the people behind America’s food culture,” and each year, the non-profit releases food-related awards in categories for Media, Leadership, and (of course) Restaurant and Chef. The America’s Classics awards are unique in that they highlight locally-owned restaurants from six of the twelve regions of the country annually — rotating the six every other year.
This year’s recipients range from Tex-Mex diners to Nezinscot Farm in the East Coast to Pekin Noodle Parlor, the oldest Chinese restaurant in the country. Each has a distinct history and fulfills the requirement of having been open for at least ten years. These restaurants are not only known for their delicious comfort food, but for their hospitality and significance to the community as well. For example, the Texas Region winner, Joe’s Bakery and Coffee Shop, is a favorite amongst Austinians for its glutinous “fried bacon” as well as its patio where voting registration efforts take place during election season.
What is special about these restaurants is their accessibility to their community members. When described, they are said to draw customers from “all walks of life” to enjoy their food. The James Beard Foundation seeks to reward restaurants that may be overlooked — rather than presenting customers with minuscule portions arranged like origami, these particular restaurants lead with huge portions of classic dishes like fried chicken or chow mein. Their reasonable prices also attract many patrons. For La Casita Blanca in San Juan, Puerto Rico, this means that students come by for a quick snack or professionals talk business over lunch at this homey local favorite.
With the rise of the social media “foodies,” these awards from the JBF help weed out the restaurants that are simply recommended because of their Instagram-worthy dishes and gaudy decor. In fact, many Instagram influencers like @twotastebuddiez or @theviplistnyc who review restaurants in Boston and New York City promote the newest, most-hip spots for cocktails and cult-classic food, but ignore the family-owned businesses that have been serving the community for ages. Not to mention, these new restaurants seem to care more about aesthetics than flavor and affordability.
In contrast to the extravagance of fancier restaurants, Manago Hotel, the winner of the Pacific and Northwest Region, is known for its simplicity. When looking at images of the hotel restaurant, there is not a tablecloth in sight, and the restaurant remains the same way it appeared in the 1940s. However, its food — specifically its pork chop — is what impresses returning customers.
The James Beard Foundation sometimes includes local fine-dining establishments in their winning selection, but this year’s group of winners do not boast particularly “fancy” menus. Other restaurant awards like the Michelin Star are more focused on luxury and do not take into consideration the effect these small restaurants have on their communities. Of course, a Michelin Star restaurant may attract tourists to the area, but the often expensive dinner experience that these places offer excludes locals who may not be able to indulge in this kind of restaurant.
All six restaurants that won the award provide something these other top-ranked restaurants do not: comfort. Their meals are nostalgic and the atmosphere evokes a sense of home for their patrons. They are staples of their community and contribute to it more deeply than simply providing quality food. Thanks to the JBF, these small, independently-owned restaurants can get the recognition they deserve for sustaining their local traditions in their corner of the country. After Covid-19, the act of going out to a restaurant is cherished regardless of whether the meal is a full-on production or a simple slice of pizza. The JBF’s America’s Choice awards shine a spotlight on the places that prioritize the small joys of going out for food.

“It’s about being your true f–king authentic self” exclaimed Elle King during her performance at Boston’s Roadrunner on Feb. 24. Silhouetted by pink spotlights and with the enormous letters “EK” traced in lightbulbs behind her, it seemed hard to believe. By the end of the show, however, she managed to live up to that statement. In the constant tug-of-war that popular country artists face between making boatloads of money and still trying to stay as relatable as possible to their fans, King straddled the line with grace. Her endearing stories and down-to-earth songs provided her with a solid connection to the audience and, hey, she played some good music along the way!
As King and her band launched into the upbeat groove of “Tulsa” to start the set, her teasing and playfulness immediately came to the foreground, contributing to her overall image as a woman full of self-confidence, which complemented the vocals she laid out casually. Her backing quartet of keyboard, drums, guitar, and bass only helped with the command over her image. Though she remained the focal point of the show, the keyboard and bass players especially shined, providing stellar rhythms to cement a variety of grooves and giving the guitarist a pocket with which to occasionally take the musical lead.
Even with the group’s unshakeable strength, King seemed to have a chip on her shoulder when it came to proving her worth as a country artist. At one point, she proclaimed that “If you got a problem with Kentucky, you got a f–king problem with me,” despite being an Ohio native. When introducing “Drunk” she made sure to point out that she and Tyler Childers are the “only two country acts at RCA … in New York City”, which seemed more like an attempt at validation for being country than a real celebration of country artists. As such, her performance tended to fluctuate. There were moments of somewhat overemphasized attempts at being country, but there were also legitimately endearing ones. When she talked about getting kicked out of school in second grade, the crowd couldn’t help but laugh, and her mini monologue of how it was important for kids to see a “woman who looks different and talks different” could have come off as hollow, but seemed to originate from a place of real caring.
However, despite her singing talent and graspable songs, King’s performance still suffered in a few respects. In the mid-sized 3,500-person venue, King managed to appear somewhat small. She rarely moved across the stage, taking only a few steps throughout the entire concert, and viewers more than ten rows deep were already looking significantly less engaged. A lack of adequate energy permeated the performance, with a distinct exception at the very end. As she launched into “Drunk” for what was clearly the last song of her set, the crowd seemed to perk up, and their chorus of the words “Baby I’m drunk and I don’t wanna go home” echoed so powerfully it almost felt desperate. In some respects, that song was emblematic of the concert’s potential, with dancing galore and a crowd louder than the singer herself.
More stage presence, some substantial crowd interaction, and even introducing her band earlier would all have created a more complete experience. At the end of the day, though, King’s concert hit hardest in her stories. Recounting the time an elementary school teacher laughed at her for saying she wanted to be a singer when she grew up and how she proved her wrong, King connected to her audience. Her message to the crowd that an ordinary person like them really could achieve their dreams if they just keep at it has been said before by a thousand different performers, and somehow it always feels cliche and hollow. But in that moment, spotlit by a myriad of colors, effortlessly winding her voice through lilting melodies while strumming away at a banjo, King could make you believe it.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR SEASON 3 OF "OUTER BANKS."
Audiences have known ever since the inception of “Outer Banks'' in 2020 that the draw of the series wasn’t its realistic plot, award-winning acting, or top-notch cinematography, but rather the adolescent hijinks astutely depicted throughout the show. The genius of Netflix’s “Outer Banks” lies in its ability to romanticize adrenaline-inducing teenage treasure hunting. But “Outer Banks” is also lucky — it was released in the middle of a pandemic, when its target demographic was stuck at home, yearning for exciting adventures with friends. The success of the first season cannot be overstated, evidenced by its overall 35.1 million hours viewed to date.
Unfortunately, the third season of the program, which premiered on Feb. 23rd, fails to deliver: Although the writing and acting on the show has never been worthy of an Academy Award, the drop in quality this season is dramatic. The writers even fail to follow through on some of the promising ideas set up throughout the new episodes.
The largest glaring issue of the season is “Big John,” John B’s Dad (Charles Halford). Considering that the disappearance and apparent death of Big John served as the catalyst for the entirety of the plot, the surprise reveal of his survival at the end of Season 2 was a massive shock for viewers. However, the resurrection of this character weakened the plot and structure of the show significantly.
By reviving a character whose death was the very foundation of the plot, the writers instilled distrust in the audience and overstepped the bounds of irrealism. “Outer Banks” has never been a pinnacle of realistic television; however, the audience’s belief in the stakes of the characters’ mortality is essential to the tensions of the series. While these characters have always been somewhat immune to the law, if they are also untouched by mortality, there are little to no remaining consequences for the risks the Pogues take throughout the show.
This act sets a bad precedent for character mortality and consistent characterization within the canon that, while conducive to plot convenience and generating contrived drama, weakens the audience’s ability to buy into the significance of these situations. Plot points that are created through these means do not feel earned, and therefore do not effectively impact the audience.
Even when Ward Cameron (Charles Esten) and Big John actually die in the finale of season 3, their deaths have little meaning considering the audience has already believed both characters to be dead multiple times throughout the run of the series. In fact, there is no dramatic weight in once again mourning characters that viewers don’t particularly like in the first place. Not to mention the fact that even in-world characters have little reason to mourn these horrible father figures — especially in the case of Sarah Cameron (Madelyn Cline), who literally threatens to fatally shoot her father only 20 or so minutes before his actual death.
The first half of the season is occupied by three plot lines: Pogue adventures, nefarious plots, and Big John/John B. father-son time. The foremost is uninteresting, and the contrived obstacles our characters face begin to reach a point of drama for its own sake. The latter is disappointingly executed, despite the potentially interesting dynamic between John B — played by Chase Stokes, who is terribly forgettable as our ostensible main character — and his unlikeable and obsessive father, who is willing to risk anything for treasure hunting. The only compelling moment brought about by this duo is when Big John murders two men in front of John B. and his son proceeds to watch in horror as he disposes of their bodies, driving home the fact that his father will risk anything for their treasure hunt. But intrigue in this vein is short lived.
The second half of the season is focused on the Pogues saving Big John from the clutches of the evil Carlos Singh (Andy McQueen). However, the writers attempt, and fail, to garner audience sympathy and interest in this plot momentum because of the poor writing of these characters. Singh is not only unrelated to the original story of the show, but entirely ordinary and unforgettable as a villain, and Big John’s belligerent nature is a severe disruption to the tone and marketability of the series. Viewers couldn’t care less about what happens to these two.
While the diegesis of Outer Banks has never been particularly easy to follow due to the rapidly paced, action-packed episodes, this is complicated further with the incorporation of several villains, leads, and side characters, all of which have different backgrounds, motivations and storylines. The writers of the third season of “Outer Banks” fail to effectively juggle this large cast of characters, resulting in a flimsy plot and expository writing that make for a confusing viewing.
Despite these structural issues, there are some exciting moments this season. Episodes 3 (“Fathers and Sons”) and 5 (“The Heist”) stand out with typical Pogue tom foolery and are more entertaining than the rest. Episode 9 (“Welcome to Kitty Hawk”) is unique in its storyline about Kiara (Madison Bailey) being sent away to wilderness camp therapy, and it is enjoyable to watch JJ (Rudy Pankow) try to rescue her. The excitement of this sequence can largely be attributed to the slow-burn romance between Kiara and JJ that originated as a fan-ship and built throughout the series. The relationship was officially introduced to the canon in season 2 in an act of fan service and now accounts for a large portion of current viewership despite the diminishing quality of the show.
The final episode of the season sees a return to the traditional treasure hunt appeal of the show: A respite from the eye-rolling gun fights, ridiculous escapes, boring villain through-lines and forced romantic dramas that bog down and hold back these new episodes. The expedition sequence that showcases John B. and Sarah Cameron traversing the treacherous jungle caves that house El Dorado (the main treasure objective of this season) is legitimately entertaining and somehow manages to instill some sense of tension and investment in the audience.
Sequences like these serve as a sad echo of the enthralling energy of the series’ first season. However, “Outer Banks” season 3 is by no means a strong piece of television and reflects a downward trend in quality in the program that began in season 2 — indeed, both seasons pale in comparison to their predecessor. That being said, the show has already been picked up for a fourth season and teased its next treasure hunt in the final scene of season 3. Whether viewers care enough about the Kiara-JJ romance to trudge through another 10 hours of poor storytelling is yet to be determined.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disembodied fingers, a miniature donkey named Jenny, and a Catholic witch.
These are just three of the outlandish entities that figure prominently in Martin McDonagh’s “The Banshees of Inisherin.” And while these examples correctly convey the more-than-slightly wacky nature of the film, they fail to capture how McDonagh’s adept combination of such ingredients makes for one of the more strikingly beautiful and emotionally resonant films of 2022, which is wholly deserving of the Best Picture trophy.
“Banshees” tells the tale of Colm (Brendan Gleeson) and Padráic (Colin Farrell), two feuding men who cannot find a way to end their friendship on amicable terms. The film finds its setting in the cramped village of Inisherin on a small island off the coast of Ireland, moving almost exclusively between a pub, a house, and a cliff. In its unique storytelling pursuit, the film’s idiosyncratic Irish humor, stellar cast, and breathtaking cinematography all do their part in presenting a remarkably small, poignant tale.
Of its many strengths, “Banshees’” humor reigns supreme. While the film’s synopsis and dramatic marketing do not position the work as highly comedic, it becomes clear from the very first lines that laughter is going to play an important role in the story. More specifically, this comedy finds its roots in the many mundane yet zany quirks of daily life in a remote Irish village during the 1920s. Whether it’s the nosy postmaster begging for news and blaming open letters on “the heat,” the bartender who cannot choose a side in the friendship feud, or Padráic hiding behind a wall to avoid the aforementioned witch, the film constantly assails you with characters whose every action seems a stroke of comedic genius. None of the other Best Picture nominees made me laugh as hard as “Banshees,” and as a lover of laughing, this makes me enormously partial to its cause.
Of course, such comedic success would not be possible without strong and emotionally-grounded performances from the main cast, none of whom disappoint. However, the star among stars is Barry Keoghan, who plays a lovably daft villager named Dominic. Keoghan manages to embody a highly gullible and simple demeanor in a way that is funny without feeling cartoonish, making his moments of vulnerability feel painfully honest. Even down to his skittish, awkward mannerisms, Keoghan gives life to Dominic in a way that is so spectacular it becomes impossible to go unnoticed. And when the film begins to embrace its more dramatic underpinnings in the final act, Keoghan once again matches the tonal energy with aplomb and delivers the most poignant, heartfelt speech in the movie. I hope (but do not expect) to see Keoghan take home an Oscar of his own come Sunday.
Along with the commanding performances, this Irish film unsurprisingly stands out as one of the most naturally beautiful films of the year. Shot entirely on the Emerald Isle, “Banshees” treats its viewers to many aerial shots of the verdant Irish landscape and uses such moments to maintain the film’s slightly languid tempo. The film’s use of ocean imagery is especially impressive, with the bright blue Atlantic waves serving to reinforce changing moods in the film. Contained within these landscape shots are animals of all species, which the film actually uses as much more than mere accessories. In fact, animals like the lovable miniature horse Jenny and Colm’s shepherd dog feel as though they are standing in for the audience, watching the village madness unfold with a cocked head and wide eyes.
While the moral of its story struck me as frustratingly opaque upon my initial watch, “Banshees” has resonated with me in a way that few films do, stirring up thoughts about the nature of camaraderie, stoicism, and village life. But mostly, “Banshees” is just a funny, beautiful, and touching movie — three qualities that are surprisingly hard to come by in many films. And while it could be said that the film deserves two thumbs up in addition to an Oscar, those who watch “Banshees” will understand that such a compliment could only be made in poor taste.

Best Picture
Nominees:
“All Quiet on the Western Front”
“Avatar: The Way of Water”
“The Banshees of Inisherin”
“Elvis”
“Everything Everywhere All at Once”
“The Fabelmans”
“Tár”
“Top Gun: Maverick”
“Triangle of Sadness”
“Women Talking”
Will Win: “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Should Win: “Tár”
Should Have Been Nominated: “Babylon”
Jonathan: This seems like an in-the-bag for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” And, like, that’s fine. It’s captured a generation’s imagination. Sure. But “Tár” is on another level. It’s been talked about as a cancel culture movie, but it’s really just a culture movie. That means it captures cancellation, yes, but also pretension, superficiality, ideology, power, and, above all, guilt. It captures all of these with absolute self-declaration. It should win.
Brady: I cannot say enough good things about “Tár.” More so than any of the other Best Picture nominees, I felt genuinely startled, excited, and disturbed upon my first watch. However, I am not as sure of “Everything Everywhere” being a lock to win. It seems the most likely scenario, but I believe it’s polarizing style may hurt its chances given the Academy’s ranked-choice voting system. If this were to happen, look for crowd-pleaser “Banshees of Inisherin” to play spoiler.
Jonathan: This article better top the Crimson’s “Most Read” sidebar if “Banshees” wins. Speaking of movies that fall alphabetically between “ba’athism” and “bar mitzvah,” it was disappointing to see Damien Chazelle ’07’s cocaine-fueled take on “Singin’ in the Rain” get snubbed for a nomination. If “Tár” imposes, “Babylon” bursts. Shame it couldn’t burst onto the slate of nominees; but it will burst onto filmgoing memory sooner or later.
Best Director
Nominees:
Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Todd Field, “Tár”
Martin McDonagh, “The Banshees of Inisherin”
Ruben Östlund, “Triangle of Sadness”
Steven Spielberg, “The Fabelmans”
Will Win: Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert
Should Win: Todd Field (Jonathan), Martin McDonagh (Brady)
Should Have Been Nominated: Park Chan-wook, “Decision to Leave”
Brady: The two Daniels have won most of the precursor awards and will likely seal the deal. Directing duos are cool! Also cool are the sweeping shots of the majestic Irish landscape that make “Banshees” so delightful to watch. Beyond natural beauty, McDonagh deftly and hilariously captures the fraternal intimacy of the Irish pub.
Jonathan: As much as I enjoy “Banshees,” and its digital mutilation, its cinematography is a subject on which you and I differ — as you think it is sweeping and majestic and I think it looks like an advertisement for an Irish tourism agency. “Tár”’s cinematography, on the other hand, approaches a splendid kind of ultra-modern bourgeois gothic. The edifices of today’s cultural elite become cathedrals of capitalism under Field’s gaze — and gaze is only one part of a decisive vision that registers throughout “Tár”’s runtime. “Tár” is not only great but also auteristic, and Field should win this. That would be a somewhat harder conclusion if his work were up against Park Chan-wook’s ethereal, Hitchcockian effort in “Decision to Leave.” You can always count on the Academy’s provincialism to make this kind of decision a little easier.
Best Actress in a Leading Role
Nominees:
Cate Blanchett, “Tár”
Ana de Armas, “Blonde”
Andrea Riseborough, “To Leslie”
Michelle Williams, “The Fabelmans”
Michelle Yeoh, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Will Win: Cate Blanchett (Brady); Michelle Yeoh (Jonathan)
Should Win: Cate Blanchett
Should Have Been Nominated: Rooney Mara, “Women Talking” (Jonathan); Emma Thompson, “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” (Brady)
Jonathan: On the “Will Win” side, this is a toss-up. I think that Yeoh’s SAG win indicates that the momentum is in her favor — not to mention the fact that “Well-established screen presence and first-time nominee Michelle Yeoh becomes first Asian actress to win a lead performance Oscar” is a better story than “Cate Blanchett gets her third Oscar.” On the “Should Win” side, it’s a bit less of a toss-up. Blanchett and Yeoh are both excellent, but Blanchett, with the benefit of a better screenplay, casts a longer shadow.
Brady: Blanchett’s turn as the EGOT-winning, ego-obsessed composer Lydia Tár has taken on a life of its own on Twitter, and rightfully so; the performance is unforgettable. Regardless of your love for “the televised horse race of it all,” it is impossible to watch “Tár” and remain oblivious to the fact that you are watching a great performance. As for Emma Thompson, her dialogue-heavy performance in “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” was simultaneously heart-breaking and eye-opening. Plus, Emma Thompson is just wonderful.
Jonathan: I would have been happy to see any of the plausibly leading actresses of the ensemble “Women Talking” be nominated. But Rooney Mara was the one the studio promoted for lead, so Rooney Mara’s the one who should have been nominated. The film is a tribute to the power of spoken conversation and deliberation, to the gentle electricity that can come of people — in this case, mostly women — talking, and everyone, not least Mara, pulls her weight.
Best Actor in a Leading Role
Nominees:
Austin Butler, “Elvis”
Colin Farrell, “The Banshees of Inisherin”
Brendan Fraser, “The Whale”
Paul Mescal, “Aftersun”
Bill Nighy, “Living”
Will Win: Austin Butler (Brady), Brendan Fraser (Jonathan)
Should Win: Brendan Fraser (Jonathan), Paul Mescal (Brady)
Should Have Been Nominated: Daniel Craig, “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”
Brady: Jonathan, you said it best in your rundown of the Oscar nominees. The Academy loves mimesis, and Butler is the best lookalike on the list. And I say that not to minimize his artistry. In a movie as wonky and inconsistent as “Elvis,” Butler manages to deliver a highly nuanced and poignant portrayal of The King. The closing scene of Butler singing “Unchained Melody” was one of my favorites from 2022. However, Mescal anchors his second ever film with an emotional depth that literally made my stomach ache. As a young father struggling with depression as much as parenthood, Mescal taps into beauty and tragedy in a manner far more captivating than any of his fellow nominees.
Jonathan: The Academy does love mimesis, but “Elvis” is such an un-Oscarbaity film that I don’t know if that will figure in. Butler doesn’t feel as though he’s doing a painstaking impression; he feels like a ball of musico-sexual energy. But maybe that very combination of historical impersonation with awesomeness will win the Academy over. I certainly wouldn’t complain, but I would really like to see Fraser win. He’s so lovely and understated in “The Whale,” and he’s got a classic comeback story to lift him over the finish line. As for Daniel Craig: I ranted about this in my nominations rundown, so I’ll keep this short: The Academy hates good vibes. Good vibes are good, so this is bad. Daniel Craig should be winning this thing.
Best Actress in a Supporting Role
Nominees:
Angela Bassett, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”
Hong Chau, “The Whale”
Kerry Condon, “The Banshees of Inisherin”
Jamie Lee Curtis, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Stephanie Hsu, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Will Win: Angela Bassett
Should Win: Angela Bassett (Jonathan), Kerry Condon (Brady)
Should Have Been Nominated: Jessie Buckley, “Women Talking” (Jonathan); Frankie Corio, “Aftersun” (Brady)
Jonathan: This is a really weak category this year, and I’m not enthusiastic about any of the nominees. Bassett is the best of the lot and is (Jamie Lee Curtis’s SAG win notwithstanding) the clear favorite. But Jessie Buckley, who brings her signature bite to “Women Talking,” should be in the running. Is it my favorite Buckley performance to date? No. But it stands out among this year’s crop.
Brady: I agree with the assessment of this year’s category as being weak. Angela Bassett certainly did a thing with her performance, but I am not quite sure it was THE thing. “Wakanda Forever” rushes her through the mourning process of T’Challa’s death, and Disney seems to be building her entire campaign on one (admittedly striking) monologue. Not that a supporting actor cannot accomplish amazing feats with limited screen time, but Queen Ramonda is no Fantine. Condon is afforded much more time to develop a compelling character and does a wonderful job, but she is not the best part of “Banshees.” It is hard not to believe that Corio fell victim to the Academy’s bias against young actors; the control and heart she exhibits in “Aftersun” sticks with you.
Best Actor in a Supporting Role
Nominees:
Brendan Gleeson, “The Banshees of Inisherin”
Brian Tyree Henry, “Causeway”
Judd Hirsch, “The Fabelmans”
Barry Keoghan, “The Banshees of Inisherin”
Ke Huy Quan, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Will Win: Ke Huy Quan
Should Win: Brendan Gleeson (Jonathan), Barry Keoghan (Brady)
Should Have Been Nominated: Jovan Adepo, “Babylon” (Jonathan); Brad Pitt, “Babylon”
Brady: Quan is the biggest lock of the evening. Keoghan plays the part of the village fool in a way that is immensely endearing and uniquely hilarious. In a film full of wonderful performances, Keoghan is the standout. As for Pitt, I was not a fan of his 2020 win for “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood” because his performance felt like a stale caricature of his real-life persona. “Babylon” does not veer far from this persona, but it explores its depths in a manner that is so much smarter, engaging, and devastating. The Oscars are notorious for awarding deserving actors too late, but with Pitt, they did it too early.
Jonathan: Gleeson is wonderfully moody. But Jovan Adepo, man. There’s this one shot in “Babylon'' where he’s just been made to put on blackface so that he won’t appear white in the black-and-white music film in which his character is starring; because if he appeared white, then the all-Black band would appear interracial, and if the all-Black band appeared interracial then the film couldn’t be screened in the South. The shot zooms in on him as he blows his trumpet through the cork, and there’s an intensity and a pride and a shame and an artistic seriousness coming from him that you just don’t forget. One reads and hears much about the humiliation of blackface, but I felt something new watching Adepo’s turn in “Babylon.” His whole performance is great; that scene alone should win him the Oscar.

Reviving the Past: The Attic Brings 70s Fashion Back to Harvard Square
Rome Streetz is a rapper’s rapper. Recently signed to the powerhouse label Griselda Records, Streetz is one of the hottest names in underground hip-hop thanks to his distinctly gritty delivery and razor-sharp lyrics. Drawing on the classic New York rap style, the Queens-bred rapper has created a unique sound that is far beyond mere ’90s revivalism. His recent collaborators include the likes of producers DJ Muggs, Futurewave, Big Ghost LTD., as well as rappers Ransom and ANKHLEJOHN. Last September, Streetz’s debut Griselda album “Kiss The Ring” was released to critical acclaim, kicking off a multi-city tour and earning the rapper a spot on Rolling Stone’s list of the 25 best hip-hop albums from 2022.
“Kiss The Ring” was executive produced by Griselda Records president and founder Westside Gunn. The project is an unflinching reflection of Rome Streetz’s surroundings. His words paint vivid pictures of the New York City streets he comes from, filled with tales of drug deals, street violence, and the harsh realities of city life.
“The first half of it we did in Arizona,” Rome Streetz said during a sit-down interview inside The Harvard Crimson last month. “I was hyped to be there because it was the first time I was in the studio with Westside Gunn. It wasn’t the first time I did music with him, but every time before was through email. So this time I was like, ‘I'm gonna show you that it's not no fluke, like you're gonna see me do this shit right in front of your face.’”
Streetz described his experience in Arizona as intense, with both artists working for three days straight and making around 12-13 tracks after just the first two days. The second half of the album was recorded by Streetz himself in his own home studio. While Rome Streetz can create music on the spot, he explained that it took him nearly a year to finalize “Kiss The Ring.”
“It was one of those ones where I really took my time for real, even though I do on all my shit, but I knew this one was going to be on the biggest platform I’d been on up to that point,” the rapper said. “I wanted to pull out all the tricks.”
Rome Streetz's influences have evolved over time, but he was initially inspired by mainstream rappers like Ruff Ryders, The LOX, and Jay-Z. As he delved deeper into rap, he discovered underground artists like the late MF DOOM, Dipset, and Wu-Tang Clan. Streetz is often compared, by Westside Gunn and others, to the late Big L. The Griselda rapper wears his formalist tendencies on his sleeve, seamlessly integrating melodic hooks and patterns into his verses. However, his writing is also influenced by non-musical sources, particularly authors like Iceberg Slim, Donald Goines, and James Patterson.
“I like to read and I kind of got that from being locked up because you don't really have nothing else to do but read books,” Streetz said. “Every author has a style, and as a rapper, you have a style because you’re an author. When you read certain books from certain authors, and see how well they put the words together in a phrase or a paragraph, it's like, ‘Imagine if you could do that with a rap.’”
The “Kiss The Ring” album cover features Rome Streetz sporting a diamond-encrusted ring emblazoned with the Griselda Records logo on his middle finger. The rapper shared that “Kiss The Ring” came to him as the title for the project after comparing the work against the rest of his catalog.
“When I’m working on an album, I sometimes won't choose a title until the end,” the rapper said. “At first I didn't really have a super duper thought behind why I put ‘Kiss The Ring’ as the title. But then later on, I started listening to my music, like my older shit and I’m like, ‘Yo, I say that a lot.’ So it became fitting.”
As the album became finalized, Rome Streetz acquired his Griselda Records ring from celebrity jeweler Johnny Dang. The rapper visited Dang’s shop in Houston with Westside Gunn during Griselda’s “Claire’s Back” national tour last summer. The now iconic ring was Gunn’s idea, according to Streetz. “He was like, ‘You can't have your album be called ‘Kiss The Ring’ and not have a ring. We’re gonna put this shit together.’ That's literally how it came about,” the rapper said.
Streetz followed up “Kiss The Ring” with “Wasn’t Built In a Day,” a full-length collaboration with the anonymous producer Big Ghost LTD released at the end of last month. Yet, the rapper shared that he has even more unreleased music in his vault from the “Kiss The Ring” sessions.
“Even though ‘Kiss The Ring’ is what it is, I'm like, ‘Damn, I could do some better shit,’” Streetz added. “Like once I stepped back and sat with it for awhile I was like, ‘Damn, I can do some harder shit.’ So I kept working. The fact that I kept making more songs after that is why I have another whole tape ready.”
This interview took place inside The Harvard Crimson building on Feb. 25. The event included an interview with Rome Streetz and a roundtable discussion with artists that have been recently profiled by The Harvard Crimson including al.divino, 1000word$, Starker, and YL. As a nationally renowned rapper signed to a major record label, Streetz reflected on his career so far and his experience coming to campus.
“I would have never thought I'd be in Harvard based on how I was maneuvering in high school,” Streetz said. “In high school, I was a fuckup. I was always in detention. Like I was smart as hell, but I just never applied myself. So to be here based on rap is amazing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The media giant TikTok has proliferated more than just dances. A bookish subculture on the platform called “BookTok” has amassed more than 110.7 billion views on the platform. Viewers who dive into BookTok will find numerous book recommendations, reviews, reactions, and an entire world of book-obsessed content flooding their feeds.
However, BookTok is known too often to recommend the same few authors over and over again. Within Young Adult reading, the likes of Holly Black, Colleen Hoover, Sally Rooney, and especially Sarah J. Maas endlessly appear in feeds around the globe.
Sarah J. Maas is the author of three bestselling series: Throne of Glass (ToG), A Court of Thorns and Roses (ACOTAR), and Crescent City. The hashtag #ACOTAR alone boasts 5.2 billion views — an incredible amount of traffic for Booktok. Her novels have inspired tattoos — including those sported by well known influencers Brooklyn and Bailey — as well as plenty of merchandise and countless amounts of fanfiction. In fact, these books will soon make the jump to the big screen: A TV series is in the works.
Maas is not a new author. Her debut novel was first released when she was only sixteen on the website FictionPress, before being formally published 10 years later in 2012. But, in part due to TikTok, her works have re-entered the mainstream with renewed vigor, a trend seen with other authors as well.
Her books are binge-worthy. They feature fast-paced plots, vivid world building, and lovable characters. Yet, her books also contain mature content unsuitable for many younger viewers of TikTok, both in terms of violence, language, and sexual content, often referred to as smut. Yet, as one TikTok user writes, “BookTok has an obsession with smut.”
Although the “extremely raunchy, sexually explicit” nature of many of her books could easily push them into the genre of adult novels, Maas’s books are marketed as Young Adult (YA). In an article covering her 2019 Comic Con appearance, Tor.com reported that Maas herself is surprised that her novels have been labeled in this way, seeing as there is a “three day sex marathon” in one of her books. But despite this, “she agreed to publish ACOTAR as YA as long as her editor wouldn’t censor any of the sexual content.”
It hasn’t always been this way. Book publishers experimented with a category titled “New Adult” that would create a home for the borderline books — think “A Darker Shade of Magic” by VE Schwab. But ultimately, the label didn’t stick, and the series went back to their YA labeling.
The books have performed incredibly well, finding places on a variety of YA bestsellers lists and even being popular enough to gain a fresh set of covers earlier this year. But it can be questioned whether or not marketing these books as YA is appropriate for publishers and booksellers to do.
In a 2019 interview with Tor.com, Maas noted that her introduction to sex and sexuality came through reading, which is potentially the case for many who read her books today. However, Maas’s books include not only depictions of consensual sexual encounters, but also violent, graphic depictions of rape and sexual abuse. While much of this violence is condemned — such as the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin in the ACOTAR series — some relationships leave more ambiguous morals — like Celaena being pushed to her breaking point by Rowan in “Heir of Fire” — that may be difficult for younger readers to sort through.
Maas’s descriptions of sex do not depict the experience of sex realistically either. Unlike some other coming of age novels, Maas’s books describe sex in earth-shattering, dramatic language.
It is important to note that Maas’s books are clearly in the fantasy genre and never claim to be “realistic fiction” and thus are granted far more leeway in terms of fantastical representations of sex. Nonetheless, one wonders what the impact of showcasing these unrealistic sexual scenarios has on young minds who may be first exploring ideas of sex and sexuality through literature, as Maas herself did.
As said by Maddie Ames of the Daily Nebraskan, “I walked into the Barnes & Noble, my seventh grade student I.D. hanging from my backpack, and I purchased “A Court of Thorns and Roses” by Sarah J. Maas with a crumpled $20 bill. There was no sign or notice that the book I was about to read during P.E. in junior high was filled to the brim with sexual nuances and pure smut.”
With the proliferation of these books on TikTok, younger and younger audiences are gaining access to potentially explicit content. Publishing companies further contribute to this access by marketing these novels, those of Maas and those of other authors, as young adult. With the boom in books brought on by social media, the marketing of books is worth some serious contemplation.

It’s that time of the semester again — midterms have descended upon us, we’ve exhausted our favorite campus haunts, and the confines of the Harvard bubble have become ever more suffocating. Fear not! These five underrated museum treasures offer unique getaways right in our Boston backyard.
Nichols House Museum
Yearning to explore more of Boston’s history? Look no further than the Nichols House Museum, a historic site in beautiful Beacon Hill. Although suffragist Rose Standish Nichols and her family once called this townhouse home in 1885, you can call the museum an enlightening getaway today for an $8 guided tour of the property with student ID. The museum offers an engaging exploration of Boston life at the turn of the 20th century with its rich textiles and fascinating historical objects, all while probing social concerns like women’s rights by examining the life and struggles of the suffragist movement. Be sure to take a trip this Women’s History Month, or take advantage of the free International Women’s Day tours!
Boston Museum of African American History
New England’s largest African American art and history museum is a must-see. Easily accessible from the Freedom Trail and Boston Commons, the museum is located in the former Abiel Smith School — the United States’s first public school for African American students. The site’s history amplifies the nuances of the museum’s collections and exhibitions, pointing to the complicated birth of a nation and the continued fight for justice. Timed entry adult tickets can be reserved online for $10, and you won’t want to miss out on the museum’s current exhibition — an ode to Boston’s jazz scene.
The Gibson House 
Like the Nichols House, the Gibson House is a walkable time capsule of affluent domesticity from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum preserves four floors of historical rooms, telling the stories of generations of residents and workers in this 1859 Back Bay house once belonging to the Gibson family. To modern visitors, the house’s interior may look familiar — it was featured as Jo March’s boarding house in the 2019 film “Little Women.” Get a sense of Boston’s history through material culture and savor the museum’s opulent gilt wallpaper on a guided tour for $10 with student ID.
Boston Museum of Science
This unique museum deserves a spot on your pre-graduation bucket list. Inviting visitors to become active participants in exhibits engaging all the senses, the museum offers a one-of-a-kind experiential education for all ages. Where else can you virtually fly a drone through the Arctic, marvel at an IMAX film projected onto a five-story dome, and immerse yourself in a planetarium laser show to the tunes of Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon?” Adult exhibit hall tickets are available for $29.
Boston Athenaeum
The Athenaeum’s light academia aesthetic is unrivaled. Whether you’re in the mood to marvel at resplendent portraiture and gleaming sculpture or explore a new nearby study spot, the Athenaeum’s unique blend of library and museum offers the perfect escape into Boston. Take your midterm notes and set up camp in the Pinterest-worthy first floor reading room overlooking the iconic Granary Burying Ground — with a perfect view of Paul Revere’s final resting place and Gilbert Stuart’s exquisite portraits, it’s easy to romanticize mid-semester drudgery in this vibrant hub of Boston’s cultural and intellectual life. Gain access to the first level for $8 with student ID or explore all five floors with a day pass for $40 — or join the Harvard Undergraduate Art History Society for a free tour on March 25.

A war. An older officer entrusting his men with a crucial mission that will change, if not the course of the conflict, then certainly lives. Rugged patriotic soldiers embarking on a harrowing journey. Numerically superior, dastardly enemy combatants fighting for the wrong cause. If the director is feeling particularly adventurous, the death of one of the heroic protagonists marking the emotional climax and motivating his comrades to fulfill the objective and avenge their dead friend.
That’s more or less the makings of any traditional blockbuster Hollywood war film. Some directors try to spice things up — think Sam Mendes with “1917” or Steven Spielberg with his cult classic “Saving Private Ryan.” But try as they might to break with the mold — usually with hectoliters of fake blood and gorefest — they fail miserably. Sure, their depictions of wars might be nasty affairs, but they are never a futile waste of life. At the end of the day, the protagonists and their actions contribute to something.
Edward Berger’s 2022 “All Quiet on the Western Front,” an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s novel of the same name, is not that kind of film.
Three minutes into the movie, a shell-shocked conscript, Heinrich, is forced to join an assault on enemy positions. Confused and utterly terrified, he is killed mere yards away from his trenches. When we meet the protagonist, Paul Bäumer — reissued Heinrich’s uniform collected from the dead body, cleaned, mended, and still with the previous man’s name — one thing becomes clear: This is a film about war as it really is, devoid of the propagandistic heroism and glory.
There is no hope or purpose to be found in Berger’s war, a point he drives home with brutal eloquence and striking visuals throughout.
The frontline intertwines moments of seeming normalcy with scenes of hell on earth. The soldiers are ordinary people cooking soup and cracking jokes until they have no choice but to get mowed down by machine gun fire, be rolled over — in a gut-wrenching five minute sequence — by tanks unstoppably creeping through the battlefield, and get incinerated by the enemy flamethrowers. That is, if they manage to get to the frontline in the first place, avoiding death in a gas attack at a train station, not having realized it’s too early to take the gas masks off.
Berger skilfully weaves opulent German high command chambers into the battlefield horror, reinforcing the futility of the situation and showing that the reason behind the bloodshed is not a burning desire to protect the country, but the pride and personal ambition of bureaucrats divorced from reality. The generals are well aware of the hopelessness of the situation: In fact, halfway through, they sign an armistice. But still they throw thousands into the meat grinder for “honor.”
To put it briefly, the film’s violence is repulsive and at times almost unbearable. But it is never gratuitous. It’s not a mere obstacle in the way of the protagonists, not a mere facet of war, irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The bloodshed, loss of life, futility — this is Berger and Remarque’s war. Nobody is in the right and nobody will emerge victorious.
To say that “All Quiet on the Western Front” is an anti-war film would do it a disservice. It is a war film in the fullest sense of the word. The Academy would be right to acknowledge its bold vision and poignant depiction of Remarque’s idea that “death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Art Wynwood festival in Miami turned chaotic when a sculpture by famed artist Jeff Koons was accidentally destroyed. The sculpture, titled “Balloon Dog (Blue),” was on display during a VIP preview event hosted by Bel-Air Fine Art at Art Wynwood when a woman allegedly bumped into it, causing it to fall off its stand and shatter into pieces.
The small glass sculpture is valued at $42,000 and makes up one of the many iconic balloon animal sculptures of various colors and sizes created by Koons. The incident drew a large crowd as the sound of the sculpture shattering echoed through the event space.
Some attendees initially thought that the sculpture's destruction was part of a larger performance art exhibit. However, it quickly became apparent that the piece was broken by accident, and an art advisor at the event told the Miami Herald that the woman responsible was an art collector who simply bumped into the sculpture. According to other sources, the woman touched the sculpture on purpose, not realizing it would fall. If true, this is a testament to people’s carelessness towards art, even at a VIP event with art world insiders.
Fortunately, the artwork was covered by insurance, and an insurance expert will evaluate the broken pieces of the sculpture. The visitor responsible for the accident will not be charged for the damage.
Koons’s balloon animal sculptures are some of his most famous works, and he has sold pieces for some of the highest prices ever paid for art by a living artist. Koons’s balloon animal sculptures are known for their incredibly realistic appearances and pop culture references. The now-destroyed "Balloon Dog (Blue)" was one of 799 sculptures in the series, which has now been reduced to 798 sculptures that still remain intact.
Bel-Air Fine Art’s district manager, Cédric Boero, told CNN that the sculpture was valued at $24,000 a year ago, but the price went up as other iterations of the sculpture sold out. Another version of “Balloon Dog (Blue)” sold for over $70,000 in Germany in 2021.
The broken sculpture drew offers from attendees who wanted to purchase the now-destroyed piece. Artist and art collector Stephen Gamson, who was in attendance at the event, posted pictures and videos of the broken sculpture on his Instagram, expressing interest in buying the shattered pieces.
“I find value in it even when it's broken,” Gamson told the Miami Herald. “To me, it's the story. It makes the art even more interesting.”
The shattered sculpture caused quite a commotion at the art festival, and as staff members worked to clean up the broken pieces, some attendees wondered if the destruction was a performance art piece in itself.
However, the incident ultimately served as a reminder that accidents can happen, even at prestigious art events, and also perhaps that people can be careless and need to be more mindful. As the broken pieces of the sculpture are evaluated by an insurance expert, the shattered artwork will continue to be a subject of interest and discussion in the art community. The broken “Balloon Dog (Blue)” may no longer be a complete piece of art, but its story and the attention it drew at Art Wynwood will likely live on in the art world for years to come.

“Bonsoir ! Vous allez bien ?”
Those were the first words Belgian singer, rapper, and songwriter Paul van Haver, better known by his stage name Stromae, said to greet his fans in Boston’s Agganis Arena on the night of Dec. 7. The multi-hyphenate artist stopped by Boston University for the last date of the U.S. leg of his “Multitude” tour, named after his latest genre-bending album.
The audience answered Stromae’s question — translated as “Are you doing well?” — with resounding cheers. While addressing the crowd conversationally, Stromae alternated between English and French, but of course performed his entirely French discography in his native language. Whether or not audience members were fluent in the language was ultimately a nonissue — they were still hanging on his every word.
Stromae appeared in person after an animated version of himself was shown on screen wearing a lab coat and making music alongside robots. This lighthearted, imaginative intro set the tone for the rest of the night — it was a creative, playful, and completely original concert experience thanks to Stromae’s magnetic stage presence and uniquely mesmerizing visuals.
It’s difficult to define Stromae by genre — it would be reductive to say he is just an EDM artist, or just a rapper. He has the unique ability to amalgamate many genres into a sound that’s all his own; “Multitude,” released earlier this year, is more reflective of this than ever. His supporting band also reflected his dynamic sound, with musicians from all over the world playing alongside him.
Stromae kicked off the concert with “Invaincu,” the first track off “Multitude.” “Invaincu,” which translates to “unbeaten,” has a soaring chorus fit for an arena, which hyped up the crowd to an even higher excitement level.
Stromae explicitly acknowledged that he would be switching between his new and old tracks. Within the first few songs, he performed “Tous les mêmes,” one of his most popular songs to date, off his 2013 album “Racine Carrée.” The minor-key, upbeat EDM track brought the audience to their feet as the synth horns of the chorus swelled and Stromae danced across the stage. “Tous les mêmes,” French for “you’re all the same” shares contrasting male and female perspectives of an arguing couple. Stromae brought all the satire and whimsicality of this energetic chart-topper to life on stage. Throughout the concert, he infused both his vocals and his movements with his highly animated performing style, embodying the varying emotions of each song with his signature vibrato and lively dancing.
Stromae also performed back-to-back two complementary tracks from “Multitude,” which appear alongside each other on the tracklisting: “Mauvais journée” and “Bon journée.” French for “bad day” and “good day,” Stromae used a reclining chair as a prop to reflect the opposing sentiments of these songs. He slumped low in the chair while singing the listless lyrics of “Mauvais journée”; he was then immediately reinvigorated for “Bon journée” and stood on top of the chair as it slid across the stage.
“Boston, are you happy?” he asked in time with the trap-inspired beat.
Other songs performed from “Multitude” included “Mon amour,” which features beautifully blended harmonies in the chorus and “C’est que du bonheur,” a song he wrote about his son. “J’tai donné la vie, toi t’as sauvé la mienne,” he sang in the first verse; “I gave you life, you saved mine.”
“C’est que du bonheur” is a touching song about his love of fatherhood and the circle of life — indicated by an animation behind him portraying a man in all different stages of life, from a crawling baby to a hunched elderly man with a cane. The production design was similarly impressive for “Pas vraiment,” a song about a couple questioning why they’re together; the performance was accompanied by background visuals of domestic moments seen through windows, as if the audience were peeking into their relationship. At the same time, colorful spotlights panned across the arena, showcasing audience members dancing to the song.
Stromae’s hit song “Papaoutai” — translated to “Dad, where are you?” — was one of the biggest crowd pleasers of the night. The profound lyrics, which meditate on his father’s absence from his life, are juxtaposed with the lively synth-heavy track. The lighting and stage design, including several moving screens with shifting geometric patterns, aligned with the increasingly heavy dance beat and further enlivened the performance. The stage design was also quite dynamic for “Formidable,” another fan favorite.
Stromae’s last song before his encore was “Santé,” another track off “Multitude.” Before the performance began, however, the audience was led in a dance tutorial displayed on screen with an animation narrated by the recorded voice of a female instructor. “Step to the right with your right leg, and close your left leg,” she said as the band also demonstrated these dance moves on stage. This quirky instructive interlude was a unique way to get the crowd actively engaged in “Santé,” a high-spirited song featuring a cavanquilho (a small Portuguese guitar) and a bouncy synth melody the audience couldn’t help but dance to.
After “Santé,” Stromae eventually returned to the stage for a highly-anticipated encore. The singer saved his most well-known song for last — “Alors on danse,” an international hit known for its hip-hop/house fusion, an infectious faux-saxophone melody, and an endlessly catchy hook. He built up anticipation by playing another animation on the screen, in which his animated avatar walked up to a keyboard and played the first few notes of the song, which were instantly recognizable to the crowd. The screen went black as Stromae suddenly reappeared: “Do you wanna dance?” he yelled.
The beat dropped and the stage immediately lit up with neon lights and moving screens as the audience screamed in response. “Boston, do you speak French?” he asked before launching into the first verse. A large part of the audience could, in fact, speak French, and anyone else could undoubtedly sing along with the three short words that make up the chorus,“alors on danse” — “so let’s dance.”
Following the unrestrained high energy of the climactic “Alors on danse,” Stromae and his band revisited “Mon amour” for their final performance of the night. This time around, they gathered close together for a stripped-down a cappella version. The audience grew quiet to hear their voices blend together, an intimate experience as their vocals reverberated across the large venue. The serene performance was a fitting coda to the night.
Stromae maintained his humor throughout the entire concert. After their final performance, he told the arena of fans, “It’s over now. You can go.”
In spite of Stromae’s parting words, fans filed out of the arena reluctantly, finding it difficult to leave after such an entertaining, larger-than-life concert experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Mattel’s announcement last month that they’d be relaunching the Barney franchise, everyone’s favorite purple dinosaur made his return, perhaps by unpopular demand. Since the show’s conclusion in 2010, Barney and his colorful friends have been mostly absent from the airwaves, and maybe for a good reason. In the upcoming reboot, Barney sports a shiny, new, 3D-animated look, reminiscent of other modern remakes such as “My Little Pony.” The thought of Barney’s revival has left fans polarized, with some outraged at the destruction of their childhood nostalgia and others excited about Barney’s alleged surgical reconstruction. To quote the lovable fossil, “Everybody grows, and that’s a very good thing we all do!” Maybe it’s time we all outgrew Barney.
The community is not afraid to speak out: One Twitter user assured the dinosaur, “We do not love you. And I desperately hope you do not love me,” calling this Barney redesign a “creature of nightmares.” The new look is unsettling, seeming to be the marriage of a glossy, cold exterior with an already awkward design. “This isn’t the real Barney,” another Twitter user said.
The outrage does not only come from Barney’s apparent buccal fat removal, but his new look makes him feel stripped of all his original character. Part of what fans adored about Barney was his off-putting yet fuzzy exterior. The live-action quality of the show made it not always pleasant to look at, but still made him appear warm and friendly to young audiences. The new style speaks more to a rubber toy than a loving dinosaur.
Still, some fans disagree, loving the new redesign for its modernity and removal of the proverbial roughness around Barney’s edges; his imperfections, for better or for worse, have been erased. One Twitter user claims that “Barney had a glow up.” Another insists that “Nah Barney looks better” with his updated look. For the most part, though, this remains a controversial opinion.
Overall, Barney’s redesign reflects a current trend of remaking and revamping old franchises, as companies like Mattel refuse to let past favorites die. Yet, past success does not indicate future reward. Most — if not all — of these characters’ impacts rely on the time and context of their original release. Such a dramatic redesign nullifies even the potential pull of nostalgia that Mattel is attempting to capitalize on, begging the question, who asked for a Barney remake? Certainly, the ’90s kids who grew up with Barney will not be tuning in or showing it to their children, if the millennial social media reaction is any gauge. Perhaps Barney, like his dinosaur kin, should stay extinct. We all know how Jurassic Park went.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Separating the art from the artist is a debate that has risen to the forefront of the art world as our favorite musicians, writers, actors, and — most recently — animators have been exposed for their problematic views and actions. Today’s easy access to information via the internet has revealed the vices of artists faster than ever before, putting fans in a position to either defend or abandon the creators of the art that they adore.
Further complications arise when the implications of “staying true” to our idols entails social ostracization as a result of cancel culture. With new cases and stories coming out every week, perhaps it is time to adopt a changed perspective that allows room for artists to grow and victims to heal.
To begin, it should be noted that this issue is extremely broad, as there are celebrities with varying degrees of alleged publicly abhorrent actions: People like Marilyn Manson, who faced assault and sexual misconduct charges in a recently dismissed case and the late musician XXXTentacion, whose charges of aggravated battery against his pregnant ex-girlfriend were publicly denied and posthumously dropped. Most recently, Justin Roiland, the animator and voice of beloved adult cartoon Rick and Morty has been charged with domestic violence and fans have come forward with alleged message exchanges between Roiland and minors.
Though some of these examples are clouded in mystery or lack concrete convictions, the reminder that these artists are capable of such horrific crimes is often jarring for their audiences. For instance, many viewers of Rick and Morty turn to the cartoon for a comedic escape from reality — the show features raunchy, cynical humor which viewers have loved for six seasons. However, the actions of Roiland cast the potentially problematic and morally ambiguous jokes within the animated series into a new light.
When XXXTentacion passed away, many listeners were unsure of how to grapple with mourning a beloved musician as abuse allegations surfaced. Musician Jidenna addressed this conflict in tweets which acknowledged the domestic abuse perpetrated during XXXTentacion’s lifetime in a compassionate way. Jidenna said, “The young still have the capacity to reform…a young lost kid can evolve into something greater.”
Marilyn Manson used his influence in the hard rock scene to create a culture of abusing women in the name of being a self-proclaimed Antichrist Superstar. Manson recounted numerous anecdotes which test the limits of consent in interactions with fans. In his case, the contributions he has made to the heavy metal genre do not outweigh his contempt for respecting women and fans nor the glorification of his actions within his autobiography, “The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.”
Finally, there are those artists who manage to be generally subpar people in ways which are not against the law. This includes misogynists, racists, homophobes, and the like — self-proclaimed bigots or otherwise publicly known. It does not take much investigation to discover big names in a variety of fields: J.K. Rowling, whose commentary on the trans community in a series of tweets divided fans of Rowling’s book series “Harry Potter.”
Azealia Banks, another Twitter fiend, fits into multiple categories from being banned multiple times for using language that is both homophobic and transphobic to facing charges for second-degree assault in a case which has since been reduced in a plea deal. Attempts for reentry into respective art scenes post-cancellation or call-out often double down on the flawed perspectives rather than address the inner reflection which must take place.
So, what does all of this mean? Surely, big-time offenders cannot be praised and idolized in good faith. To complicate the matter, for many of these artists the people they persecute comprise the majority of their fanbase. For this reason it would be unreasonable to ask that every gay club stops playing Banks, or for transgender Harry Potter fans and allies to burn their books and posters, but by continuing to support these artists, fans are indirectly supporting their causes and ideals.
As consumers, we must be mindful of where we spend our money and who receives our glorification, but it is unrealistic to completely remove these artists from the mainstream. Many are pioneers in their respective fields who contributed influence to their genre, not to mention the impact their work has had on fans. At the end of the day, giving due respect and support to victims is more important than a piece of artwork. We can acknowledge their contributions without allowing celebrity status to enable and normalize abuse and bigotry. Instead of complete cancellation and artwork erasure, providing room for artists to grow and become better humans allows for healing on all ends. Real changes in the culture within these art spaces and music scenes can occur through calling out wrongdoing and remembering the stories of victims.

Heerraa Ravindran, a Harvard Extension School student, has a powerful and vibrant voice that is pleasing to the ear. More importantly, though, the lyrics that her voice sings invoke life lessons and compassion. Ravindran wants to change the world, and through her music, she does.
The Harvard Extension School student has produced 20 songs available to stream, but has written at least 100. Her song “Feel Alive” won the ICon Award and Best in North America in the pop genre at the InterContinental Music Awards in 2022 as well as the International Singer-Songwriters Association International Gold award in 2021.
Her music probes themes of insecurities and being vulnerable.
“What are the realistic expectations of life, of relationships? How do you manage your ego because sometimes it gets the better of us. So like writing all this in song, and writing the solutions in the song is something that I find helpful for me, then I've seen that it's been helpful for other people as well,” Ravindran said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
However, when she wrote “Feel Alive” during the pandemic, she was not “feeling alive.” The song became a way for her to revitalize herself.
“That song, that was after feeling like I can find what makes me happy. I got to really reflect, ‘Who am I?’” Ravindran said.
While many of her songs arise from her own experiences, they are also for Ravindran’s listeners.
“I think that's how my songs act. Like, whether you know it or not, it is getting you to slowly start living by these values of being someone who's happy with themselves, being someone who is driven to chase after their goals, being someone who's hopeful even though there are bad days that you encounter,” said Ravindran.
For example, “Crazy” encourages listeners to overcome the maddening aspects of life, and appreciate what can be “crazy good,” as Ravindran said.
Ravindran has believed that music could change the world since she was 14. When she, a self-identified “emo teenage kid,” accompanied her mother to a social business incubator called ET Ideas. There, she realized that pursuing a career in music was not just a dream, but could be a reality.
“I'm not sure how it's like throughout the world, but where I grew up in Asian culture, [If] you want to pursue a career in the arts or like become a singer, it is kind of frowned upon […] So, to actually get people to believe in me, that was something that really shook me,” Ravindran said.
Since then, Ravindran has continued making music to help “shake” others. As that is her goal, she does not inhibit herself to a certain style or genre. Rather, she lets the genre arise from the song’s theme.
“The reason why I write songs is to convey messages. It's really for myself and for my audience, for us to grow. First of all learn different things that we encounter as human beings. And the byproduct of that is writing songs that best cater to each mood, each journey,” Ravindran said.
For instance, whereas “Crazy” and “Feel” belong to the pop category, “Attention Island” falls into R&B, “which was purely accidental,” Ravindran said. The slower tempoed, deliciously moody song discusses fame and its false promise of happiness.
“I didn't even know that was an R&B song. I just wrote it one night. And like, months later, I brought it to the studio and someone was like, oh, that's an R&B song,” Ravindran said.
Other genres that Ravindran explores include funk-soul and retro-pop. For example, “Across the Universe,” which is part of Harvard Undergraduate Songwriters’ Collective’s 2022 album, features her stirring yet tender, truly soulful voice accompanied by disco inspired beats.
Ravindran’s music, however, is not her only way of changing the world. In 2015, she co-founded the international youth movement Ascendance, which engages children and young adults from ages eight to 23 in career exploration, workshops, and leadership programs.
“I think at first off, a lot of us don't have the luxury of taking the time to find out what we love to do,” she said. “And if only we did that, we'd be much more happier, we can make better decisions as adults. So first off, getting them to find their passion. And then second of all, how do they actually achieve those results while they're still in school?”
In the past eight years, Ascendance has collaborated with more than 50,000 students across 26 countries. In 2022, Ravindran retired from her position as Chief Operations Officer. Now, in alignment with the organizations’ goals, her pupils are the ones running the operations.
Although Ravindran cannot entirely disclose her future plans, she can attest that some international collaborations are on the way.
“I'm looking forward to working with people because I think it's always nice when you can collaborate with like minded people. It gets you to grow as an artist. It gets everyone's careers to a different level as well. And you get to create music that's life changing,” Ravindran said.
Not only does Ravindran excel in musical and humanitarian fields, she also endures the workload of being a Harvard student. In fact, while many complain about their 9:00 a.m. courses, Ravindran attends class at 6:30 a.m. due to the time difference between Boston and Malaysia. Her contagiously positive attitude is certainly helpful.
Regarding the upcoming midterms, Ravindran says this: “It can be crazy, but it's nice because we're not alone. And I think that's something that we can all feel a bit better that we're not doing this alone.”
Ravindran’s published songs can be found on Apple Music, Spotify, and Youtube.

In April of last year, my grandma and I walked into a full theater to watch one of the most influential movies of 2022. We could barely find a place to sit before the movie started and as soon as it did, I knew that it would be a life-changing experience. The audience gasped, laughed, and cried with each other. It was the first movie since the Covid-19 pandemic that reminded me of the beauty, joy, and unique experience that only watching a film in theater can provide.
The director duo, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Schienert, dreamt up a universe of hotdog-fingers, googly-eyes, and everything bagels that proves not just mind-boggling, but heart-warming. Through its depiction of family relationships, depression, loneliness, and the overwhelming nature of society today, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is able to deeply connect viewers to its heartfelt message about love, empathy, and understanding. Simply put, this movie feels like a breath of fresh air, a warm embrace, or a cup of hot cocoa on a freezing winter’s day. Like no other nominee, it simply deserves to sweep the Oscars, including the trophy for Best Picture.
It is hard not to compare this action-packed multiverse movie with other time-traveling, multiverse-hopping films already out there. When I left the theater, I could not help but think about how much better this movie handled the multiverse than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I also thought about its similarities with “The Matrix.” However, it somehow still felt like a unique story that has never been told before. With lots of creativity and imagination, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is able to be a surprising and genuinely original film. Where else will people find a love scene with limp hotdog fingers? A fight scene swinging dogs, fanny packs, and using buttplug-shaped trophies as weapons? Or scenes representing nihilism as a huge, spinning everything bagel?
Some people — including my grandma — have argued that the movie, although entertaining, is overwhelming. With that said, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is a small movie with a combination of new ideas, themes, and experiences that Hollywood has not been able to create in the past few years.
All of these tricks could be easily dismissed if it was not for the heartfelt storyline that keeps this movie tightly wound together. Stripping this movie of the staggering visuals, the intense battle sequences, and wonderful audio composition (think of the stillness of the talking rocks), leaves a simple, wholesome story of family bonding that everybody can relate to.
It is not just the message that makes this film a strong contender. It is also the diverse cast and phenomenal acting of Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu, James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis that push it over the edge. Lead actress, Yeoh, says it best in an interview with the Associated Press. “We’re a tiny little movie with a big beating heart, without a doubt,” she said. “We had ambitions because we felt that our story just needed to be told. In times of chaos and turbulence, this is a movie about healing. It’s about love. It’s about a very ordinary person — which we all are — who’s given the opportunity to be a superhero with superpowers that are love and compassion.”
When I left the theater, I told my grandma that there are going to be a hundred directors wanting to do the same thing and never be able to pull it off. As the awards season comes to a close and the Oscars grows closer, my hope is that the Academy voters will realize that “Everything Everywhere All at Once” has an unmatched cinematic creativity that needs to be applauded. Most of all, this film needs to be acknowledged for its innovative storytelling, its phenomenal visuals, and its unique ambition.

Abandoning the “Creed” series’s tendency to mirror the action of the acclaimed “Rocky” films, “Creed 3” paves a distinctive path away from its predecessors. What results is a remarkable exploration of visuals and narrative, creating a film that is instrumental in cementing Adonis Creed’s own memorable cinematic legacy.
Michael B. Jordan, the film’s star and director, centers “Creed 3” around the comfortably opulent and influential boxing legend Adonis Creed amid his transition into retirement, a full seven years after the events of “Creed 2.” Creed’s violent past, however, begins to resurface as childhood friend, Damian (Jonathan Myers), finishes his prison term and comes back to fulfill his own dreams of becoming champion.
Despite holding a spot in the “Rocky” franchise, the film grapples with the remnants of Creed’s past rather than Rocky’s, excluding Sylvester Stallone entirely from the cast. The remaining plot features a long-deserved focus on the fighter for which the trilogy is named. This refreshing shift complements Jordan’s expressive, novel directing style — setting the film up to top the two films it follows.
The film’s largest contribution to the franchise lies in its meaningful narrative. Creed’s boxing journey previously had one set path: fighting to win the title. But “Creed 3” not only lifts Creed out of the shadow of his father’s career, it also places the movie outside the traditional boxing narrative. The film’s exploration of weighty themes of childhood trauma and forgiveness complements the violent nature of the sport, adding dimension that is indubitably more fulfilling than other sports films.
Looking for meaning solely beyond the film’s fights, however, would be ill-advised. Jordan’s creativity is a revolutionary addition in capturing the complexity of the ring. Creed’s final fight begins with expected shots of a boxing match surrounded by thousands of eyes in an arena. Although, in mere moments, Jordan strips this cinematic expectation away, shooting the entire fight in an empty stadium. A focus on the two fighters and the past they are desperate to escape — amidst the constraints of the ring — is an outstanding display of cinematic exploration that sets the film apart.
Where the film loses some of its creative stamina is in its pacing. The beginning half of the film simply drags on far slower than a “Creed” movie should, proving that building on the story of Adonis Creed undoubtedly requires some less-than-interesting work. Notwithstanding successful narrative additions, the film falls short on creating enough constantly engaging scenes that have epitomized the trilogy for nearly a decade.
Jonathan Major’s notable stand-out performance, however, makes up for the film’s slower pace. Major is not only a new face, but the most dynamic opponent Creed has ever faced. Excellent emotive delivery and passionate performances allows Majors to bring his multifaceted villain to life. In addition to Major’s performance, notable cameos of Creed’s past opponents, such as Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), were heartwarming reminders of the series’ growth.
The series’s reputation for exceptional soundtracks certainly does not falter in the new film. “Creed 3” features a series of tracks produced by J.Cole’s Dreamville Records, with a blend of high-intensity and melodic pieces that coalesce into an outstanding complement to each scene. And, in “Creed” fashion, the film went further to perfectly tailor iconic “Creed” and “Rocky” theme music to scenes that developed themes from past films.
“Creed 3,” above all, works hardest in excelling beyond its impressive style to simply create a fulfilling addition to a franchise 44 years in the making. The film undeniably represents the future of sporting cinema — pivoting from a superficial sports movie to an adept reflection on the life and legacy of its central star.

The week of Feb. 22, Manual Cinema’s production of “Frankenstein” sold out every show at the Emerson Paramount Center before the five-day run started, adding an additional Sunday performance. The show presents an experimental production that screens a film while also revealing its live creation on stage.
Though a play with no audible dialogue isn’t for everyone, “Frankenstein” is a gripping form of audiovisual performance art that immerses the audience in all of its elements.
Over the last two centuries, many people have told the story of Victor Frankenstein and his creature through a variety of mediums, from the original novel by Mary Shelley and scary campfire stories to thrilling films. The Emmy-award-winning performance collective Manual Cinema draws on every one of those mediums in their production.
The cast and crew blur the lines between theatrical performance and live film. Throughout the show, the audience views a central screen that shows physical actors, puppets, animation, and textual quotes from the original novel. Additionally, Manual Cinema frames the story in a new way by beginning the show with a portrayal of Mary Shelley’s life leading up to writing the novel, based on true events.
The performers convey Shelley’s aspirations to become a writer, her strained relationship with her husband, and the experience of losing her first child. She enters into a competition with her husband and his colleague to create the best ghost story, launching into the world of her creation.
Including Shelley’s personal narrative deepens the emotions the fictional novel “Frankenstein” initially conveys by allowing the audience to see another dimension of Victor Frankenstein’s ambition, his monster’s loneliness, and the loss all characters feel throughout. While “Frankenstein” has been done more times than one can count, Shelley’s life story is less well-known but — as Manual Cinema conveys — just as narratively intriguing, expanding their production beyond a mere recreation.
From there, the plot follows the authentic story of Frankenstein and his monster fairly closely, from creation to abandonment and destruction. At the same time, the production is an original, imaginative depiction that touches every sense to create a longing for family and connection true to Shelley’s initial intentions.
With projections and scenic design by Rasean Davonte Johnson, the set resembles a performance studio. Three white screens are set up on stage, where actors and puppeteers rotate throughout the show incorporating shadow puppet design by Drew Dir with Lizi Breit, projecting two and three-dimensional puppets, the silhouettes of actual actors, and combinations of all materials. The main screen hangs about 15 feet above the stage, showing the content captured by the other screens — sometimes combining drawings, puppets, and actors’ movements from one or multiple screens at the same time — for the audience to view together in the center.
Rather than feeling chaotic, the use of many moving pieces coming together for one picture seems deliberate. Because of the flawless execution, transitions to using different areas on stage and across mediums feels fluid.
Every movement is timed precisely; actors rush out of the light so the screen can move fluidly to the puppeteers’ next scene, and vice versa. Additionally, all performers demonstrate a remarkable awareness of the whole set as the actors interact with shadows and multiple puppeteers huddle around one projector’s stage glass to create an image. The lighting design by Claire Chrzan highlights the active sections of the stage while muting others, a considerable achievement considering the many screens that remain on stage while inactive that would be distracting otherwise.
There are no lines in the play but the actors more than make up for it by using strong gestures that also translate to their scenes as silhouettes. Though the story is dark overall, the cast still communicates lighthearted moments, such as Shelley’s relatable annoyance while she struggles with writer's block.
Sarah Fornace makes a striking impression in her roles as both Mary Shelley and Victor Frankenstein. The audience's ability to see the artists creating a film and the film itself simultaneously makes the production feel all the more impressive by making the immense effort going into it tangible. At times, Fornace performs so well as a two-dimensional puppet that the audience questions whether puppeteers are moving paper on stage until they notice her acting against a backdrop.
In addition to the set pieces used for film projections, the stage holds a band to one side and an elaborate percussion setup to the other, including chimes, symbols, pots, and a xylophone. The band’s visible position on stage adds to the audience’s feeling of being in an immersive art studio. Their prominence also represents their importance to the storytelling in a play with almost no lines, creating both music and sound effects that establish an eerie, desolate tone as the most engaging element of the performance.
“Frankenstein” certainly doesn’t come off as the typical play or trip to the theater. Instead, Manual Cinema’s latest touring show is more on par with modern immersive art experiences, successfully reinventing a classic. Without audible words, the show manages to capture the story similarly to how a reader might feel picturing it in their own imagination.

For many listeners, classical music conjures up images of old men in powdered wigs, ballerinas in swan-like tutus, perhaps even a season or two of Bridgerton. The origins of classical music are rooted in Western Europe, with pieces originally being written for churches and royal courts. Given the genre’s long history, four periods have come to define the style’s development. The baroque period spanned the 17th and 18th centuries headed by composers like Bach and Vivaldi. The classical period followed through the 18th and 19th centuries under the leadership of prominent composers like Mozart and Beethoven. The romantic period of the late 19th and 20th centuries brought a more personal and emotional style of the genre, and finally, the quartet is rounded out by the contemporary period beginning in the 20th century and continuing through today.
Behind the antique curtains of Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro,” Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker Suite,” or Handel’s “Messiah,” lies a fountain of lesser known composers and compositions from across the four periods of music that provide a fresh vantage point from which to explore the genre.
This nonexhaustive list presents a small window into the world of unique classical songs out there through a new approach to appreciating this music.
Recontextualizing Classics
“Dance for Harp and Orchestra, L. 103: 2. Danse profane” - Claude Debussy (1904)
Heavy on the harp, Debussy’s “Danse Profane,” brings a light-hearted, whimsical feel to classical music. The song’s soundtrack-like nature tells the story of an ethereal dreamscape, with soft harp notes transitioning into louder orchestral movements then back to silence — creating a sense of exploratory suspense.
“Prelude from Bach Cello Suite #1” - Alex de Grassi (1994)
De Grassi’s fresh take on this quintessential piece of classical music brings even more appreciation to Bach’s original cello arrangement. The overlapping of melodies and harmonies all on a single guitar provide a young and spritely feel to a very poised piece of music.
“Scarborough Fair” - Sheku-Kanneh Mason & Plínio Fernandes (Arranged for Cello and Guitar by Simon Parkin) (2020)
Mason and Fernandes take Scarborough Fair to a new level, abandoning the traditional use of winds to play this English ballad from the Middle Ages. In combining the sounds of guitar and cello to express the old folk song’s haunting melody, the song becomes almost comforting and familiar. Parkin’s arrangement of the piece is more than just transposition, it is a literal rearrangement of rhythms and note patterns and it’s that unpredictability that keeps the listener on the edge of their seat.
“Spiegel im Spiegel” - Arvo Pärt (1978)
The intimacy of the simple opening arpeggios from the piano and the water-like flow of the violin intertwine in a delicate dance. “Spiegel im Spiegel” signals innocence and rebirth, mirroring the piece’s contemporary composition – a modern musical rebirth and reimagining of classical music.
Beyond Piano and Strings
“Romance in D Flat Major, Op. 37”- Camille Saint-Saëns (1871)
Saint-Saëns’s flute solo starts off sweet and almost understated, but gradually becomes majestic as the music crescendos and reaches several high notes that punctuate the climax of the piece. This confidence is maintained as the piece progresses. The dynamism between sweet and confident helps the piece maintain a balance between unnoticed and overwhelming — the perfect song to listen to on a peaceful walk.
“Five Bagatelles, Op. 23A, V. Fughetta: Allegro Vivace” - Gerald Finzi (1945)
One of Finzi’s “Five Bagatelles” featuring a clarinet alongside a piano, “Fughetta” displays a crisp and playful clarinet sound with bright notes that engage in a dance with the corresponding piano accompaniment. Although playful, the clarinet maintains a grand and dignified air that seems to evoke an image of an older child telling their younger siblings a daring story.
“Variations on a Hungarian Folksong “The Peacock”: Moderato” - Zoltan Kodaly (1937-1939)
Kodaly’s Moderato of “The Peacock” is yet another wind clarinet featured piece. The piece opens up with timpani and horns, then the clarinet, lending to an innocuous and calming blend of winds that keep the climax of the piece a surprise. A minute into the piece, a series of string instruments bring buoyancy to the piece, before a harp comes in and the music begins to soar. Listeners will get the sense of flying, an obvious nod to the piece’s name.
“Introduction and Allegro for Harp, String Quartet, Flute, and Clarinet” - Maurice Ravel (1905)
Ravel’s chamber music piece combines the lightness of the string and wind instruments to create a frantic energy reminiscent of raindrops — with the harp cutting through periodically to calm the piece down as if caught in the eye of a storm.
Underrepresented Identities in Classical Music
“3 Compositions, Op. 40: No. 2, Berceuse” - Amy Beach (1898)
Beach, an American female composer, composed this brief lullaby alongside two other compositions entitled “La Captive” and “Mazurka.” Beach imbues a loving and caring ambience into this piece with a violin melody firmly but smoothly maneuvering over a peaceful piano in the background.
“Feeling Exceptional”- Kris Bowers (2020)
Black composer Kris Bower’s “Feeling Exceptional” is one of the pieces composed for “Bridgerton” (of which Bower composed the whole score). The piece mixes the vintage classical music feel representative of the regency era the show is inspired by with a more modern percussiveness — driven by dramatic drums and a consistent bass — that give the song an addicting quality.
“Hang the Art” - Khari Mateen (2021)
Mateen, a Black composer from California, composed this piece for a film called “Really Love” that premiered in 2020. With opening chords from a piano, slowly followed by the comforting resonance of a cello, this one-minute piece maintains a spacious introductory aura that spells out the feeling of new love.
“Chrysalis Extended” - Nia Imani (2021)
Nia Imani Franklin is a Black female composer from North Carolina and the founder of ComposeHer, an advocacy project that highlights female composers. Just after a slow introduction featuring a smooth set of elongated chords played on various strings, with an almost unnoticeable underlying percussive rhythm from a bass, “Chrysalis Extended” almost leans into jazz with various horns pushing on the original string baseline, much like a butterfly escaping a chrysalis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College campuses are hubs of sexual activity. For the first time in their lives, many students have the freedom to mingle outside the panopticon of parental supervision. But lots of sex can lead to unwanted pregnancies. Almost 40 percent of women who seek abortions are under 24 years old.
Why, then, are we not urgently discussing the effects of Dobbs v. Jackson on campus life? Since the decision last year, 18 states have implemented abortion bans or made abortion care unavailable, and six more state legislatures have indicated plans to ban abortion. Some universities in these states have begun severing ties with Planned Parenthood and restricting access to birth control and other services. Now, students may be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.
In anti-abortion states, campus culture will inevitably become more hostile to reproductive rights. Whom do students talk to in the event of a broken condom or late period? What about students needing emergency procedures out of state?
Restrictive state laws incentivize residential advisors, proctors, and professors to remain silent and turn a blind eye to these life-changing decisions. Otherwise, particularly in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama, they could be sued for “aiding and abetting” an abortion — a legal standard that seems low enough to encompass almost every kind of support.
At first glance, institutions such as Harvard — situated in states with strong pro-access laws — seem far from the front lines of the war over reproductive rights. But legal scholars have suggested that these vicious laws could extend their tendrils across state lines. If universities aren’t careful, even those in blue states may no longer be safe spaces for abortion-seekers.
Colleges like Harvard need to stop sleepwalking and preempt the fight before it happens. Legal, financial, and moral support should be a priority.
To understand why, consider the following hypothetical: Sheila, an imaginary Harvard College student, travels home to Texas for winter break. She gets pregnant, and when she returns to campus, she realizes she needs an abortion. She contacts her Resident Dean who points her to campus resources and funding sources that can finance her procedure. Sheila gets the abortion at a local clinic in Massachusetts.
Turns out, the Resident Dean might be liable under Texas law – despite the fact that neither the advice nor the abortion took place in Texas. The statute is not by its terms limited to in-state actors.
New legislation could further clarify this vicious interpretation of Texas law. The Texas Freedom Caucus, a group of Texas state representatives, has declared plans to specifically target those who provide support or funding for out-of-state abortions. Prohibitions, they write, will apply “regardless of the law in the jurisdiction where the abortion occurs.”
To be sure, the legal case is by no means cut and dry. The Constitution protects the right to interstate travel, so it is unclear just how far laws can reach across state lines. But in any case, regardless of their success, suits implicating those involved in abortions are extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming hurdles. Moreover, the very threat of litigation can be both terrifying and psychologically burdensome, particularly for a young college student.
In addition, these suits sow seeds of distrust that will spread even to universities in pro-access states. After all, what’s to prevent Sheila’s roommate from suing her doctor and trying to collect the $10,000 bounty that Texas is offering?
Without proactive policy, even universities in pro-access states will be moved towards caution when providing abortion funding or other aid to students from red states. This could create a chilling effect that stunts conversations about reproductive health.
Ultimately, support networks may disappear as suspicion permeates the social fabric of campus life. Students — particularly women of color who are disproportionately likely to lack access to reproductive health services — will be forced to make serious decisions alone and isolated from any institutional assistance.
Thankfully, Massachusetts and other blue states have enacted “shield” laws designed to strengthen reproductive rights and protect against out-of-state subpoenas, summons, and judgements. But these laws themselves may be subject to constitutional challenges. And with hundreds of new anti-abortion bills, legal ambiguity will only increase.
Some might say that universities should steer clear from controversial political issues. But the looming threat is a health crisis, not a political one. Universities have a duty to support their students in need of reproductive healthcare.
Thus, in addition to providing funding to students for abortion-related services and travel, universities should partner with groups such as the Abortion Defense Network, connecting faculty and campus resources with trusted attorneys who can provide legal advice and representation. Also, universities should promise reimbursement for any affiliates facing legal fees for undergoing or supporting abortion. Hopefully, these measures will help prevent a culture of fear from consuming campus.
It is imperative that Harvard and peer institutions get ahead of the game and prepare for a legal war. The crisis is not only out there; it’s on our campus as well. Students seeking abortions should not have to live in uncertainty. It’s time to shift campus conversations to reflect this urgency, even in pro-access states.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When each of us joined in the decade-long battle to divest Harvard from coal, oil, and gas, we understood that it was a key part of the fight to slow down climate change by reining in an industry that had gone rogue. We backed up the students leading the fight in every way we could think of, helping organize everything from faculty resolutions to alumni office sit-ins.
We were overjoyed in 2021 when Massachusetts Hall finally acknowledged what students had been saying all long: As The Crimson editorialized at the time, “Our investments matter. They showcase our ideals and our moral character… Harvard’s decision to free itself from fossil fuel investments shows our commitment to reducing the extent and impact of climate change.”
But the story isn’t over yet. Harvard’s faculty and staff, and many other college instructors and workers across the country, are still — though most of them don't know it — profiting from climate change through their vast retirement plans, invested by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.
TIAA’s portfolio — $1.2 trillion with a T — makes even Harvard’s endowment seem puny, and it is heavily invested in climate destruction. TIAA, through its in-house asset manager Nuveen, is the world’s fourth-largest holder of coal bonds. It has sunk huge sums in tar sands companies like Enbridge, which paid local police departments to crack down on Indigenous protesters trying to stop its Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota, and in corporations like Exxon, which use the money to open up still more new oil fields, long past the time when it was obvious that needed to stop. TIAA even created shell corporations to grab land illegally in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiverse savanna that borders the Amazon — funding deforestation that has become a mortal threat to the people who’ve long lived there and to the planet’s biology.
We could make a long and strong financial argument against these investments. The fossil fuel industry has for a decade underperformed the market, and dramatically. It appears to have gained a temporary bounce last year when longtime industry friend Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, but fortunately, war profiteering has a short half-life. Hydrocarbon prices have already resumed their decline — a decline likely to continue as renewable energy grows ever cheaper.
TIAA claims it has a “fiduciary duty” to act in its clients’ interest. But as Tom Sanzillo, who once oversaw New York state’s massive pension fund, has put it: Not divesting runs counter to that fiduciary obligation, because funds without fossil fuels do better in the long run, avoiding volatility, stranded assets, and coming crashes.
But there’s an even more important argument to be made. Of all the investors in the world, TIAA may be the most hypocritical, because the people it purports to represent are precisely those most revolted by the ugliness of their policy.
TIAA handles pensions mainly for university educators and staff, doctors, nurses, and medical researchers. That is, its money comes from the natural scientists who first diagnosed the climate crisis, the social scientists who have worked out its economic, political, and psychological dimensions, and the clinicians who treat the casualties it creates (recent evidence: one human death in five comes from breathing the byproducts of fossil fuel combustion).
We don’t want our life savings invested in things that shorten the lives of our fellow human beings or make the planet unfit for everyone’s retirement. All of us are educators — we’ve given our lives to the cause of preparing young people for the future. Why would we want to foreclose that future?
It would be one thing if we had no alternatives. But these same universities have helped work the clean energy miracle over the last few decades. From our labs have come the innovations that have helped to make pointing a sheet of glass at the sun the cheapest way to generate power on planet earth. Of course it’s worth investing in solar power, wind power, and the batteries to store the energy they produce!
This is why so many academics have demanded that TIAA change. From the State University of New York system, to the public universities in oil and gas states like Colorado and Montana, to Ivy Leagues like Cornell, more than 1.7 million educators have gotten behind the TIAA-Divest! drive to reform the giant fund.
Harvard needs to join in this fight. It’s time for a faculty resolution calling on TIAA to put an immediate moratorium on any new fossil fuel investments and to get out of the land grab business. We don’t need ‘cleaner options’ to let some people tidy up their portfolios and their consciences; we need comprehensive action now, on a scale commensurate with the crisis we face.
Since we’re both teachers, let us add one more thing. In different ways, our work has explored one of the central and now indisputable facts of the climate crisis: The big fossil fuel companies knew about global warming decades ago, and they lied about it. Exxon, for instance, was warned about the greenhouse effect by its own scientists and later started building its drilling rigs higher to compensate for the rise in sea level they knew was coming.
But they didn’t tell the rest of us: Instead, the industry invested in a vast campaign of denial and disinformation. This kind of intellectual dishonesty would get students bounced from our classes and professors from our faculties. If our profession’s commitment to, um, Veritas means anything, it should certainly get these investments bounced from our portfolios.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From accusations of eyelid suturing in infant monkeys to descriptions of the separation of young macaques from their mothers, a recent letter condemning nonhuman primate experiments conducted in Harvard Medical School professor Margaret S. Livingstone’s lab certainly pulls at the heartstrings of its readers.
The authors of the letter — members of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Clinic and the University of St Andrews’ Wild Minds Lab — claim that the experiments conducted by Livingstone lacked “ecological validity” and involved “cruel and unnecessary treatment of laboratory animals,” ultimately calling for the National Institutes of Health to revoke funding for her research.
In a debate ruled by pathos, our Board’s first instinct might be to condemn Livingstone’s research practices. At the same time, we feel under-equipped to evaluate the ethics and reasoning that surround experimentation procedures in medical science – a field that is renowned for its rigorous research standards, yet admittedly feels inaccessible to us.
From an official standpoint, it seems unlikely that Livingstone broke any rules. As a researcher at HMS, Livingstone was held to guidelines for animal experimentation that were set and enforced by the school’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, as well as national entities such as the NIH’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Indeed, HMS has strenuously maintained that Livingstone followed all applicable guidelines for the humane and safe care and use of animals, and Livingstone herself responded to earlier criticism of the same nature with an extensive letter defending and explaining her practices of eyelid closure and maternal separation.
The fight between researchers and animal rights activists seems to have stagnated, with neither side — and neither impassioned letter — yielding to the opposing viewpoint. Such complexity invites us to look further at the contested borders of scientific research and ethics, spotlighting a debate around animal experimentation that remains, well, fuzzy.
We are suspicious of the claims that Livingstone’s research “cannot add any meaningful contribution to our knowledge,” as stated by authors of the recent letter to the NIH.  As Livingstone’s letter points out, techniques like eyelid closures  — as unsettling as they may sound at first — actually helped to pave the way for modern non-invasive methods of studying early visual experiences. Furthermore, Livingstone’s work on maternal attachment could potentially be relevant in developing interventions to help women deal with loss in the aftermath of a stillbirth. We’d also be remiss not to note that Livingstone was awarded the Society for Neuroscience’s Lifetime Achievement Award — a distinct honor that speaks to the enduring caliber and impact of her research.
Still, despite our suspicions about the claims levied against Dr. Livingstone’s work, it is prudent to acknowledge that many prominent scientists and primatologists have raised concerns with her research. Emotional reactions, too, belie ethical concerns that cannot be easily rationalized out of existence.
As such, HMS and Livingstone should not gloss over such accusations. Instead, they should actively work to clarify the methods and merits of this research to the public — particularly when immediate emotional reactions to the subject of animal experimentation have proven, time and time again, to be potent.
From allowing biologists to discover the causes of diseases to helping researchers isolate the side effects of medication, the undeniable reality is that ethical animal experimentation has played a crucial role in some of the modern era’s most important scientific advancements. As such, while we continue to support humane alternatives to animal testing when possible, we believe this recent call for a complete withdrawal of funding from Livingstone’s lab is an inappropriately strong response to the issue at hand.
As a Board, we often prioritize harm mitigation; here, the competing appeals of both perspectives — one pulling at our heartstrings, the other at our budding scientific rationality — makes it difficult to draw a universally unobjectionable ethical line.
But that doesn’t mean that we, or any other party to this discourse, should shy away from the blurry boundaries of animal experimentation. Instead, the recurring nature of conflicts and controversies such as this battle of letters demonstrate the importance of investing in education at the nexus of science and ethics. Armed with a stronger understanding of the nuanced debate surrounding research practices, we hope students like us will be able to articulate more confident and informed opinions surrounding issues such as these in the future.

The Harvard Graduate School of Education held its 21st annual Alumni of Color Conference on Friday and Saturday, marking the first fully in-person iteration of the conference since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Student co-chairs Justis F. Lopez and Sari Saint-Hilaire organized the conference, titled “A Journey Towards Healing: Authenticity & Activism in Education,” alongside HGSE lecturer Christina Shiao-Mei Villarreal. Last year, HGSE invited members of its 2021 graduating class and other Harvard affiliates to attend the conference in-person while all other participants joined virtually.
“As a long-standing member of the HGSE community for over two decades, I know just how important these convenings are to all who attend, and even all those who will see the pictures and know that they belong here,” HGSE Dean Bridget T. Long said during the conference’s opening remarks.
This year’s conference included a faculty panel featuring Villarreal, senior lecturer Karen L. Mapp, Associate Dean Maritza S. Hernandez, and associate professor Bianca J. Baldridge, as well as a keynote address by Jamila J. Lyiscott, a professor of social justice education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Lyiscott’s remarks emphasized maintaining optimism while fighting for social justice.
“When we’re socialized into institutions that demand our erasure in order for us to survive there, we inherit a script about our value and the value of our communities,” Lyiscott said. “We’ve got to think about what it means for us to engage in some powerful waymaking and rescripting.”
During the faculty panel, Villareal said she looks to her students — past and present — for inspiration during difficult times.
“I’m not accountable to this institution. Yes, I know I work here, and I don’t want to get fired,” Villarreal said. “But I’ve always accepted that that is a potential. Otherwise, I’m here for the job, and not for my community. I’m accountable to the young people in our communities and our classrooms — period, the end. And that is something that has sustained me even in the hardest moments.”
The conference also included five breakout sessions, where attendees could choose between an array of workshops on specific topics, including diversity in STEAM education and ways to advocate for undocumented students in higher education.
The conference was formally dedicated to Turner J. Cooper, who graduated from HGSE with a master’s degree in learning and teaching in 2022. Cooper died on Dec. 14, 2022.
At the conference, three of Cooper’s peers at HGSE unveiled a commemorative portrait of him.
“Turner was an experience, he was a light, he was pure joy. He was an intellect, a friend, a creative, a teacher, and a convener, and so much more. We’re here today for Turner, and we wanted to bring him with us to this AOCC,” 2021 HGSE alumna Cierra Cooper said as the portrait was unveiled.
The conference concluded with the presentation of five awards. Two awards — the Alumni Achievement Award and the inaugural AOCC Turner Cooper Award for Commitment to People-First Practice in Education — were presented to Cooper.
The Tina Hansar Award for Educational Equity, presented annually to an HGSE staff member, was awarded to security officer Dinesh Thapa. Current HGSE master’s student Alexia Leclercq was awarded the Kolajo Paul Afolabi Award for Commitment to Educational Justice, and the Faculty Award for Education Equity was presented to lecturer Aaliyah S. El-Amin.

Lê’s Vietnamese Restaurant is set to relocate to Boston’s Chinatown due to renovations slated for the Garage Building — a shopping mall located at 36 JFK St. where the restaurant is currently housed.
The precise timing of the restaurant’s move remains unclear and depends on the Garage’s redevelopment, which was approved by the Cambridge Historical Commission in June 2021. El Jefe’s Taqueria and Ben and Jerry’s previously operated within the Garage before moving to different locations in the Square last year.
Trinity Property Management, the company in charge of the Garage’s renovations, will give Lê’s three months’ notice before the restaurant will be required to relocate, according to Lê’s manager Vinh Le.
According to Le, because Trinity Group Management has not given the restaurant an indication of when renovations will begin, the timeline for the restaurant’s relocation is unclear.
“I just know that they’re gonna rebuild and do construction,” Le said.
Many students said they are saddened and surprised to see the Harvard Square favorite depart.
Noah S. Lee ’22-’23 said he “definitely felt devastated” and “very, very surprised” when he learned about Lê’s relocation.
“It’s definitely the best phở on campus,” Lee said. “I think having a Vietnamese restaurant on campus is also just really awesome for the community.”
Lee said Lê’s was one of the first restaurants he tried in Cambridge when he arrived on campus for Visitas, a program for prospective admitted freshmen to experience Harvard.
“A couple of my upperclassmen friends grabbed me by the arm and said, ‘Hey, you have to try Lê’s,’” Lee said. “This is a staple on campus.”
Lucas H. Amory ’24 said he was “shocked and bewildered” by Lê’s relocation, adding that the restaurant holds sentimental value for him and other Harvard students.
“You go to Lê’s for social interaction,” Amory said. “Lê’s is there for you to bond with other people as well.”
“It feels like one part of the soul of Harvard that you kind of expect to be there for you,” Amory added.
Students said a large part of Lê’s charm lies in its convenience and prices.
“The service is really good,” Veronica A. Li ’26 said. “It’s really fast, and the prices aren’t too bad.”
Li added that she believes Lê’s added “some variety amongst all the ramen shops” in the area. In recent years, several ramen restaurants have opened their doors in the Square.
Matthew E. Nekritz ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, said he finds it “really sad” to see local favorites depart from the Square.
“It’ll be really interesting to see what comes up,” Nekritz said, adding that he believes the restaurant scene is “definitely shifting.”
Even as Lê’s prepares for its move, Griffin H. Wong ’24 said the restaurant will always hold a “special place” in his heart.
“Lê’s is the first place where I really felt like I belonged at Harvard,” said Wong, a former Crimson Sports chair.
“It’s definitely a big loss for the Square,” he added.

Cambridge city councilors and residents considered a proposed alternative to police responding to mental health-related 911 calls and discussed whether officers should patrol the Cambridge Housing Authority’s L.B. Johnson Apartments at their weekly meeting Monday.
Policy Order 7 would provide city funding to the Cambridge Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team — a non-profit that promotes and practices non-police responses to people in crisis, particularly those with mental health issues — and involve the organization in city emergency response activities.
During the public comment section of the meeting, MIT professor Huma Gupta said the Council should fund HEART, citing her students’ struggles with bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses.
“This is why the killing of Sayed Faisal was so shocking and troubling to both my students who struggle with these mental illnesses and myself, because we knew it could have easily been any of them,” Gupta said.
Lexington resident Ken Reilly said in his public comment that in February 2022, the Lexington police shot and killed his son, whom Reilly added “had mental health issues.” Reilly was wielding a knife prior to being fatally shot, according to police.
“I can’t imagine the state of mind he was in,” Reilly said of his son. “So if you had someone who was skilled, they could’ve de-escalated it, because they would’ve known his background. They would have known this situation with my son.”
Most councilors said they were supportive of Policy Order 7 during the discussion.
Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, who also supported the policy order, exercised her charter right to postpone a decision on the policy order to allow concerns over wording to be addressed.
The police were also at the crux of the debate over security at the Cambridge Housing Authority’s L.B. Johnson Apartments in Cambridgeport.
Police have been primarily called to the development by older residents who feel unsafe in the building hallways. Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan questioned why city police resources, and not private security, were being used to secure the residence.
City Manager Huang said private security services were impractical due to their poor interaction with residents and staffing issues, in response to Zondervan.
“Would it be really great if we had a non-police option that was able to do that? Yes,” Huang said. “Have we been able to actually build a really great team within the police department that is doing that role and getting to know everybody on the street and trying to engage with them? I think they’re doing a pretty amazing job.”
Councilor E. Denise Simmons said the residents’ choice of police protection reflected trust between the community and the department.
“Many of our senior citizens, when they think of safety, police is their go-to, and it’s good to know that in Cambridge our senior citizens and many others feel very comfortable going to the police department,” she said. “So that, in my opinion, bodes well for us.”
Throughout the meeting, councilors also passed policy orders relating to elevator failures in high-rise buildings, defibrillators in public parks, and housing vouchers.
The Council will continue its discussion of the HEART initiative at its next regular meeting on March 20.

In 2010, Tamara K. Lanier was still reeling from her mother’s death. Though her day-to-day work as a probation officer continued, Lanier still wrestled with the promise she had made to her mother before her passing: documenting their family history.
She relayed this promise to the old cashier at a small ice cream shop where she usually ordered a salad before going back to work. In a stroke of luck, the cashier happened to have a passion for genealogical research and offered his support.
The moment catalyzed a more than a decade-long endeavor undertaken by Lanier to link her ancestors to Harvard’s long-standing ties to slavery. During her ancestral research, Lanier came across daguerreotypes, an early form of photography, commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz that depict bare-chested enslaved people. She identified two people in the images as Renty — whom she says is her great-great-great grandfather — and his daughter Delia.
Lanier, who is currently pursuing an emotional distress lawsuit against the University for its possession of those images, is slated to publish a book about her genealogical research and the emotional journey involved in claiming ownership of the daguerreotypes. Lanier did not comment on the book’s release date.
With an overarching theme of generational love, the book will also combine memoir and biography to tell the stories of Renty and Delia.
“When you read this book, you’ll have an amazing understanding of who Papa Renty was,” she said. “I want the readers to feel with me when I’m going through these slave indexes.”
“I remember thinking of the inhumanity of man to have such a marginal view of life, of Black life and Black bodies, to equate them with pigs and other chattel,” she added.
Lanier’s mother — a retired teacher — would often recount stories of Renty to her family to memorialize his legacy. Renty was an enslaved man who taught himself, and then others, to read — despite it being a criminal offense to do so.
Upon reconnecting with the man from the ice cream shop, Lanier learned about the racist research practices of Agassiz, which the University’s landmark report on its ties to slavery characterized as “abusive.” Agassiz’s work was centered on eugenics and polygenism, a racist strain of pseudoscience that alleged Black racial inferiority on the basis of genetics.
“I saw him as this amazing educator,” Lanier said of Renty. “He’s done remarkable and amazing things, and the scientific racism is an insult to this man’s legacy.”
The daguerreotypes used in Agassiz’s research are currently in the possession of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Upon encountering the daguerreotypes commissioned by Agassiz, Lanier said she felt a sudden influx of emotions as she first saw Renty’s image, which reduced him to a research subject — a stark contrast to the stories Lanier’s mother told her.
“Immediately, I knew that that was the man that I had heard so many stories about my entire life,” she said. “I remember just staring, trapped in a gaze where I’m just staring and staring in his eyes, and I felt like he was staring back at me.”
“I was originally thinking, ‘Oh, how my mom would have loved to see this image.’ And then I’m like, ‘Oh my God, if my mom lived to see this and know this, it would hurt her to her core,’” Lanier added.
When she saw the daguerreotypes, Lanier said, she knew she had to honor the full story of Renty’s life.
“I knew in that moment that I had to do something to correct this narrative, to say to not only the curators of the world, but to Harvard, ‘This is not who my Papa Renty is,’” she said. “He was an amazing man who has a rich oral history and a rich legacy that has lasted almost 200 years, since children are still talking about him 200 years later — that’s how important this man was.”
Beyond publishing the book, Lanier said she is also in the process of advocating for legislation in Connecticut and Massachusetts that would allow cultural groups to obtain their “plundered property.” Such legislation would follow in the footsteps of the Holocaust Expropriated Art and Recovery Act and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, she said.
“Why do you have to legislate human dignity? But apparently you do,” she said.
Lanier said she hopes to encourage discussion and reflection on the stories encoded in cultural artifacts.
“When we think about museums and other institutions that curate, what is the larger story, the history of the artifact, or the history of how they acquired it? What story should be on display?” she said.

Harvard Law professor Guy-Uriel E. Charles discussed the decline of what he termed the “civil rights consensus” — a set of legal and political ideologies coming out of the American civil rights movement — at a Harvard Law School talk on Thursday.
The lecture, titled “Identity Crisis: The Future of Racial Equality in the Twilight of the Civil Rights Consensus,” marked Charles’s appointment as the Charles J. Ogletree Jr. Professor of Law. Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 moderated the event.
The professorship was established in honor of Ogletree, a public defender and law professor who taught at Harvard from 1984 to 2020. During his career, Ogletree advocated for racial justice, represented public figures including Tupac Shakur and Anita Hill, and founded the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at HLS.
Charles described the civil rights consensus as typified by Supreme Court cases — most prominently, Brown v. Board of Education — and legislation — the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965. He argued that these shifts recognized that America’s history of racial discrimination compelled legal conditions that provided extra protections for minorities.
“As a matter of formal law and also as a matter of political morality, non-white others have special standing and must be accounted for within the constitutional, political, and economic order,” Charles said of the civil rights consensus.
Nonetheless, Charles said that legislation within this framework, like the Voting Rights Act, often targeted only the worst instances of discrimination, rather than establishing more robust structures of equality. Courts allowed efforts toward legal equality to move “only so far and only so fast,” Charles said.
Though courts recognized legal claims that prevented resources from being denied on the basis of race, they did not require that the resources be provided in the first place, Charles said.
“You don’t have to provide a material good, but if you do provide it, you must do so without excluding people because of their race,” Charles said.
For example, in the 1971 case Palmer v. Thompson, the Supreme Court allowed the city of Jackson, Mississippi, to close its public swimming pools instead of integrating them.
Charles said he believes the civil rights consensus is in decline and that society and the courts “are increasingly less committed to the proposition that non-white others have distinctive claims on the polity because of our history of discrimination.”
Instead, he argued, they are embracing the model of anti-classification, which deems race-based legal distinctions illegitimate. As the Supreme Court prepares to hear Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, Charles predicted that the Court will find that “race-conscious admissions policies are no longer consistent with the law.”
Beyond that, Charles said he thinks rising racial antagonism and controversy over critical race theory demonstrate renewed conflict over the process of reconciling America’s racial history with its national identity.
He laid out several possibilities for the future politics of race in the United States: rising class-based consciousness, heightened partisanship, conflict between liberalism and illiberalism, unified national identity, or racially essentialized tribalism.
Before Harvard, Charles taught at Duke Law School and the University of Minnesota Law School. He received his J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School. His legal scholarship has focused on political processes, race, and power.
“My work has been animated by trying to understand what we owe each other as self-governing people,” Charles said.

Dain Perry, a descendant of the largest slave-trading family in U.S. history, and Constance R. Perry, whose ancestors were enslaved, discussed reparations and the legacy of slavery at a Monday Harvard Divinity School webinar.
This event is the fifth installation in HDS’ six-part webinar series “Religion and the Legacies of Slavery,” which expands on the findings of the University’s April 2022 Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery Report. Harvard Divinity School professor of Africana Religious Studies Tracey E. Hucks moderated the discussion.
Constance Perry, who is descended from enslaved people in North Carolina, said she believes she and her husband Dain Perry were “brought together to do exactly what we’re doing.”
“I think our stories hopefully will help people to see that we can, in fact, have conversation,” Constance Perry said. “And that we’re able to do this work together.”
The Perrys have toured the country for more than 500 screenings of the 2008 documentary “Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North,” produced by Dain Perry’s cousin, Katrina Browne.
The documentary follows Browne, Dain Perry, and other descendants of the DeWolf family as they travel from Rhode Island to Ghana and then to Cuba to reckon with their ancestors’ role in enslavement.
The DeWolf family brought more than 10,000 enslaved Africans to the Americas and continued to hold investments in slavery through plantations in the Caribbean even after the abolishment of slavery in the Northern states.
During the event, the Perrys, who are members of the Episcopal Church, also discussed the importance of faith to their work.
A member of the Diocese of Massachusetts Racial Justice Commission, Constance Perry co-chaired a subcommittee that proposed a resolution calling for a reparations fund and the full disclosure of the church’s history related to slavery. The resolution passed almost unanimously in 2020.
“God has an interesting sense of humor. And I don’t know what he was up to, but I think that we were brought together for a reason,” Constance Perry said of her marriage. “Faith is at the core, I believe, of what we do and how we do it.”
During the event, Hucks asked Dain Perry whether he believes families like his should provide reparations to the descendants of enslaved people.
“I hesitate to say, ‘Yes, we should.’ But I think our society needs to make major steps in that direction with reparations,” Perry responded.
Dain Perry called on pastors, rectors, and other ordained attendees to “muster up the courage to preach about race.”
“It’s so critically important that our pulpits in this nation talk about this frequently and not on Martin Luther King Sunday, not for Black History Month, but at times that are unexpected,” Perry said.
During the webinar, the Perrys also discussed the concept of white privilege.
“I prefer to use the term white advantage,” Dain Perry said. “We have an advantage because of our white skin. We have a privilege because of our white skin.”
Dain Perry said it was important to understand the history and legacy of slavery today.
“We cannot heal as a nation until us white folks truly understand the history of how African Americans have been impacted over the years,” Dain Perry said.
The Divinity School will conclude its lecture series on March 20 with a conversation titled “Reflecting on Religion and the Legacies of Slavery.”

Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services Chief Barbara Lewis touted expanded and more accessible mental health resources in an interview Friday.
Lewis said the CAMHS Cares support line, launched in July 2021, and telehealth service TimelyCare, launched in October 2022, have both seen extensive use by students since launching, adding that the programs have expanded accessibility to students in need.
According to its 2022 annual report, Harvard University Health Services overall received more than 25,000 virtual visits from July 2021 to June 2022. CAMHS Cares answered 2,421 calls over the same period.
Lewis called the support line’s first year “hugely successful,” adding that the line continues to receive about 300 calls a month.
“It’s not a crisis line; it’s a support line,” Lewis said. “Students in a crisis can certainly call it, but we want to make it clear that students who just need to talk to someone also feel free to use it in the moment when they are having anxiety or something’s going on where they want to talk to someone.”
Lewis praised TimelyCare’s work since its October launch, noting that on average, student surveys had awarded the virtual service 4.95 stars out of five on counseling visits and 4.93 stars on psychiatric visits. A total of 1,743 students have signed up for TimelyCare so far, and there have been 2,403 virtual visits to the service, she added.
The service has seen 2,030 counseling visits and 325 psychiatric visits since its launch in October, according to Lewis.
“We continue to work to improve the access to mental health care in CAMHS,” Lewis said, adding demand for mental health services remains “consistently high.”
Lewis said CAMHS’ target for their wait times is 10 business days, a goal which was difficult to hit in the fall due to staffing shortages. In March 2022, wait times stretched as long as six weeks — nearly half of a 14-week semester.
TimelyCare wait times are as little as five to eight days, Lewis said.
Lewis said CAMHS is working to develop a clinical access team, at the recommendation of the Office of the Provost’s Mental Health Task Force — launched in 2019 to combat CAMHS’ long wait times and an increase in mental health issues on campus.
The fall 2022 semester saw student suicides at the College and the Law School.
“Our goal is to have a total of six full-time clinical access coordinators, who will be the ones to meet with students for their first consults and coming to CAMHS,” Lewis said.
In the last few months, CAMHS has hired 16 clinicians as part of an effort to combat prior staffing shortages, Lewis said, which previously hindered student access to the service.
“That limits your accessibility when you don’t have all the people that you need to be here,” Lewis said.
The CAMHS chief expressed optimism about efforts to promote accessibility, and in particular, for the new hires that have fleshed out the service’s staff.
“I think they’re very motivated,” Lewis said of the new clinicians. “They’re very passionate about the work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 announced the appointment of Linda Eastley, an alumna of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, to the vice chair of the Boston Civic Design Commission in late February.
The BCDC, a division of the Boston Planning and Development Agency, reviews large or public development proposals for aesthetics and their impact on the city.
Eastley — the founding principal of Eastley + Partners LLP, a university campus design firm — has served as a commissioner on the board under four different mayors. She graduated from the GSD in 1993.
Joining Eastley as commissioners will be Laura Solano, an associate professor in practice of landscape architecture at the GSD, and Shauna Gillies-Smith, an adjunct professor in landscape architecture at the GSD and an alumna of the school.
In a press release, the BPDA said the new appointments will “provide diverse perspectives that will help shape Boston’s growth in a way that will ensure both residents and visitors experience Boston as a City for everyone.”
Some people might misunderstand the BCDC’s mission to mean making sure that buildings “look like or affirm the buildings around it,” Eastley said. However, she clarified that the board chiefly decides how to “improve the way that we experience our city,” including clarifying how a project might contribute to public space and interact with existing design features.
Eastley said she has found her tenure on the board gratifying. She said she often recognizes developments in her daily life that were once brought to her as proposals for review.
“Whenever I walk through the city, I note the buildings that we’ve worked on,” she said. “We’ve been able to really improve those projects for the betterment of the city.”
Eastley said she was moved by the impact that she has been able to have on the local landscape throughout her career, which began while she was a member of the Harvard Real Estate and Planning Group at the GSD.
“There’s a tremendous satisfaction in knowing that others are enjoying — in this case other Cantabrigians — are enjoying the spaces that you had designed and that they were impacting the beauty of the city,” she said.
Sarah M. Whiting, dean of the Graduate School of Design, said in an interview that she was “thrilled” to learn about the trio’s appointments to the BCDC. She referenced the school’s focus on design in the greater Boston area.
“We want to be a resource to help the city of Boston but also Cambridge,” she said, citing the example of GSD studio courses, many of which are based on projects in the area.
Whiting specifically discussed the need for a design education to address contemporary challenges, including the addition of a “Climate by Design” course to the landscape curriculum.
“The significance of climate and social justice has permeated the role of design,” she said.
Whiting said the GSD’s curriculum emphasizes the role of design in how people experience the world around them.
“Design affects how people are organized in the world — how our city is organized, how a building is organized, how people interact,” she said.
“To be a designer, you need to be tuned into things going on at the local level,” Whiting added.
Eastley similarly pointed to the value of design in crafting a positive city environment for Boston’s residents.
“The way that those projects are stitched together create that unforgettable series of moments for all of us Bostonians,” she said.
Eastley, Gillies-Smith, and Solano will take up their new posts in April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly two years of construction, renovations to Adams House’s Randolph Hall, an undergraduate residence at Harvard, are now set to complete this spring — a change in timeline that has exacerbated some residents’ frustration about the project’s shifting schedule.
The renovations of Randolph Hall are now “on schedule to be complete in April 2023,” according to Executive Director of House Renewal Stephen Needham. The new date represents a shift to the construction timeline; as of Feb. 21, the Harvard Construction Mitigation website stated that Randolph Hall would be completed “by the end of 2022.”
“I was under the impression that Randolph was supposed to be done, and it’s very clearly not yet,” said John D. Bourland ’24, an Adams resident. “I’ve just kind of grown to accept that it’s under construction and will be for a while.”
The project is the second of three phases in a broader set of renovations to Adams, one of 12 upperclassmen houses at Harvard, initially set to conclude in 2022. Delays to construction — due in part to a five-month construction moratorium during the Covid-19 pandemic — led to a year’s delay in the renovations to Randolph Hall and a two-year delay to the project overall, which is now slated to conclude in 2025.
Needham added that once renovation work began following the moratorium, “construction proceeded according to plan.”
During the renovations to Adams, some sections of the house — such as Randolph Hall — have been rendered uninhabitable due to the ongoing construction, forcing some of the house’s residents into overflow housing.
Bourland — who was assigned to overflow housing in Fairfax Hall last year — said he felt the prolonged construction has alienated some Adams residents.
“A lot of people in temporary housing are disjointed from where they’d normally be,” Bourland said. “The construction is in the middle of a lot of our buildings, so it’s kind of isolating.”
Several students said the renovations to Adams were desperately needed. Randolph Hall had not seen a renovation project this large since its construction in 1897.
Ann C. Nguyen ’25-’26, another Adams resident, said the old buildings of Adams House have significant accessibility concerns.
“I’m glad to see that they’re going to do something about accessibility on campus,” said Nguyen, a former Crimson Arts editor. “I have to walk up four flights of stairs to get to my room, and I can only imagine how inaccessible it is to most of the houses here.”
Needham said the renewal of Randolph Hall will prioritize accessibility, adding that the renovated hall will include two elevators and be fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Needham added that the hall will have updated plumbing, mechanical, and electrical systems and will include upgraded insulation, doors, and windows.
Aaron B. Shuchman ’25, a Crimson Sports chair and Adams resident, said the construction itself – marked by scaffolding, fencing, and construction vehicles that still line Bow and Plympton streets – has not been “too intrusive.”
“I barely notice the construction,” Shuchman said. “The noise hasn’t been particularly bad.”
Instead, some residents’ frustrations have stemmed from the lack of noise – a sign of slow progress.
“Honestly, I feel like they never work, so I don’t hear any noise,” said Adams resident Harrison D.K. Wallace ’25, noting delays to the house’s renovations.
Needham noted that the Adams faculty deans and the project’s architects had solicited student feedback and provided updates at a series of town halls throughout the construction process. The House Construction Mitigation website also provides weekly updates on the renewal.
“They’ve done a good job, I think,” Shuchman said. “They’re making an effort to be transparent.”
The project is set to enter its final phase this summer when renovations begin at Westmorly Hall, which contains Adams’ only dining hall.
Adams residents, many of whom have limited time left at the College, expressed mixed feelings about the project’s conclusion.
“We’re happy that it’s happening as part of Adams,” said Bourland, who will graduate before the renovations are completed. “It’s just unfortunate that we’re here right before we get to experience it.”

Leverett is one of the few remaining houses to have weekly (yes, every week!) steins. And what is a stein? Basically, a stein is a casual HoCo-run social event with free food and drinks, and who doesn’t want free food every single week? According to Kang, “people are coming to events now more than ever!” Get ready to have the perfect excuse to pause that essay or pset and meet different members of the house community each week!
Leverett is also known to deck out their dhall for every occasion imaginable. Plus you can bank on monkey bread — the best treat to exist — every Thursday night at community dinner. Besides the decorations and monkey bread, the Leverett dhall is a popular spot for office hours — a massive perk when the math pset is due 11:59 p.m. and you started at 7 p.m.
Kang also reveals that “Lev has the best merch.” Not only are the designs creative and eye-catching, but Leverett HoCo conducts beautiful editorial style shoots where they get members of the house involved — even the faculty deans were featured in the photoshoot! You should check out the aesthetic forest green Harvard-Yale crewnecks that Leverett designed.
From beautifully renovated McKinlock hall to the massive G and F towers, Lev has got to be one of the most architecturally unique houses on campus. It has all the different types of Harvard architecture in one house. However, Leverett isn’t just interesting on the outside — the inside has every variety of room you can imagine: a suite, a hallway single, a tower room with a view of the Boston skyline, a beautiful renovated room in McKinlock. According to HoCo Co-Chair Austin C. Ma ’24, the tower suites have the “largest common rooms.” Not only are the common rooms massive, but many of the tower rooms have floor to ceiling windows with beautiful natural light.
The natural light doesn’t stop there. The Leverett library reminds Kang of “something I'd see out of ‘Avatar: The Last Airbender’” and the dhall is known for its high ceilings, large windows, and beautiful natural light. So, when the Cambridge winter months get really dark, Leverett is the place to soak up what sunlight you can – even while studying all day long.
How would you describe the vibe of the house?
AM: ​​ How I would explain it is that when you’re walking, like, anywhere in Lev, in the dining hall or in the elevators, you'll always see people you know, and it's a really great part of the community.
How would you describe Leverett as an ice cream flavor? What flavor and why?
AK: “I would go with strawberry. First of all, everyone loves strawberry. I think a lot of my favorite things about Lev are the natural sunlight streaming and the fact that it’s bunnies — very high energy. Everyone’s really nice and when it's hot out, everyone’s out there playing in the sun. I think Lev could be well represented by a strawberry patch.”
What Harry Potter house would Leverett be?
AK: I’ve got to go with the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw like a mix of them.
AM: There are some smart bunnies.
If a first-year is placed into Lev, what would you tell them?
AK: I would say definitely expect to never not have something to do. I think we are at least one of the only houses where every single week on Thursday at 9 p.m., we'll have a Stein so no matter what. And like no matter what you're into, we probably have something that caters to it.

One of the foremost perks of Dunster life is its prime location on the banks of the Charles River, halfway between the Yard and the Science and Engineering Complex. Nearby Bluebike and Harvard shuttle stops ensure that Dunsterites are always able to find opportunities to escape the Harvard bubble. But, if you end up staying on campus, close proximity to the other River Houses allows residents to pset at Leverett House’s Math Nights or party the night away in Mather House. As a member of the Moose community, your surroundings are sure to be envied by the rest of the Harvard community.
“I’ve seen other housing day videos where people will be attacking us and then those same people will have Dunster as their cover photo on LinkedIn,” Fez S. Zafar ’24 said. “So, I have to say, I think other people kind of wish that they were also here.”
While Dunster’s central location and beautiful scenery places its exteriors close to the heart of Harvard’s campus, the House itself has a beautiful heart in its vibrant, supportive student community. Leah G. Tadese ’25 likened Dunster’s community to root beer, “bubbly” and “just so sweet.”
Dunsterites also enjoy the special privilege of an extended dinner service, lasting until 8:30 p.m. to accommodate athletes with late practice times and to feed hungry students past the unfathomably early 7:30 p.m. closing time of other dhalls.
HoCo Chair Avi P. Gulati ’24 said that this contributes to Dunster’s tight-knit community, explaining, “It gives everyone an extra hour, you know, an hour of extra social time. And I think that that extra hour is visible in the fabric of our community. I think an extra hour does a lot to bring people together.”
Gulati also highlighted Dunster’s many House traditions as another key to the vibrant connections between Dunsterites. One of Dunster’s most interesting traditions is the Goat Roast, an event that (until a few years ago) featured the roasting of a goat in the House’s courtyard. Now, the event has been revamped to include a petting zoo, with the Resident Dean hosting a goat pardoning ceremony. Upon their entry to the community, residents also enjoy a sophomore cruise during orientation and can look forward to Dunster Cheers, or steins with karaoke, sushi, and other exciting themes. Life in Dunster also includes smaller, more frequently occurring traditions, including open houses hosted by House staff with food cooked by Dunster students and concerts featuring student performers.
New Dunster residents will also be able to engage with Dunster’s top-tier intramurals group. The House hovers at the top of the IMs leaderboard, neck and neck with Kirkland. The competition is important, but the opportunity to build community is stronger: “We never forfeit a game because if we know we’ll lose, at least we’re going to have a good time,” Gulati said. Even House staff contribute to the hype around IMs, with Allston Burr Resident Dean Michael Uy promising to get a tattoo if Dunster secures the Straus Cup. “​​We’ve been wanting to win,” Gulati added. “Not because we love victory but because of schadenfreude—we glee in our Resident Dean’s slight misery.”
Uy’s bet is indicative of the fun relationship between Dunster residents and House staff. “They’re wonderful to talk to in a house of 400 people. They remember your name, which is, you know, they have no reason to. I do feel like they’re a part of the house community,” Crimson Arts contributing writer Jonathan A. Schneiderman ’25 said.
Zafar expressed similar sentiments about his tutors, mentioning, “They don’t get in students’ way, but instead they try to facilitate more community and help us have fun. And they’re always really there for us whenever we have a problem or a question or something. They’ve 100% been really great tutors.”
While about a third of sophomores will end up in Dunster proper, the rest will find accommodations in 10 or 20 DeWolfe Street, known colloquially as DeWolfe. The rooms in DeWolfe are spacious and mostly quads, with two doubles attached to a large common room in a suite with an ensuite bathroom and a kitchen. Another perk to living in DeWolfe includes the SEC shuttle stopping right outside of 20 DeWolfe—super helpful for Engineering and Computer Science concentrators—and a (slightly) shorter commute to the Yard.
In Dunster proper, sophomores may find themselves in quads or hallway doubles, but can look forward to singles and larger suites as they move closer to graduation. Gulati, when asked about the party scene in Dunster, referenced these larger suites, saying, “What I’ll note is that we have many high-occupancy suites, six or seven, that provide lots of space, and students have the option of hosting peers in those spaces.”
Dunster residents also benefit from several impressive amenities contained within the House’s walls, including a gym, a squash court, and a Grille, boding well for incoming sophomores with midnight cravings for mozzarella sticks and milkshakes.
Dunster also includes several study spaces, with options attuned to any set of study needs. Among these is the Smart Classroom, with state-of-the-art technology suited to optimize your studying (or movie-watching) experience. Dunsterites also enjoy the House’s beautiful library, which Avi mentioned “feels like a sacred space” and is “a remarkable space historically, physically, spiritually.” A word to the wise, though: according to Gulati, “Armchairs in Dunster are basically a melatonin pill.” Dunsterites might also choose to study in the dhall and the basement, which double as social spaces, allowing students to mingle their academic pursuits with building valuable connections with other House residents.
Not sold on Dunster yet? Flyby chatted with the HoCo chair to learn more!
What’s your favorite memory involving House staff?
APG: My friend and I once wore Red Sox shirts in the Dunster lobby, and the building manager, George, just unleashed all of his friendly vitriol about us because he’s from New York City and he’s a Yankee. And he wouldn’t let go of it for, like, days. Like every time we’d see him, he would remind us that we were traitors to him, of course in the friendliest way possible. And that was just sort of sweet. It was friendly. It was sportsmanship. Coated in friendly animosity.
Which Hogwarts house would Dunster be in?
APG: Gryffindor. 100 percent. There's just no question. Our colors are red and gold. If you stand in our courtyard and look up at the white pediment and the crimson and gold clock tower, you feel like you’re in a “Harry Potter” movie.
What’s the weirdest aspect of life in Dunster?
APG: You can see everything that happens in the courtyard from the windows. I’ll just say that you can see a lot that happens through the windows from the courtyard.
What Harvard student archetype is Dunster?
APG: Dunster would be the hot Social Studies kid that built his own skateboard to go and can go super fast on it between the SEC and Northwest Labs.
If you could change one thing about your House, what would it be and why?
APG: I wish everyone in Dunster was actually housed in Dunster because there are times when I feel bad as a House leader that so many of our students are in DeWolfe, and it’s sometimes difficult to integrate them in house communities compared to integrating students that actually live inside the space.
What’s one thing that you want freshmen to know about your House?
APG: We are the Grays of the River.
And what’s one piece of advice you have for freshmen as they look towards Housing Day?
APG: If you hear a chant about Cabot coming to your door, it might not actually be Cabot.

A gorilla or a lion, Mather is the only house with two mascots! Why? No clue. It makes Mather quirky and unique to all houses around. But those are not the only quirks and perks in this cOncRetE jungle.
Puppies. Happy hour. Mather Lather. The list goes on.
The tutors’ dogs are a main attraction at Mather. “The dogs are really nice,” says HoCo Co-Chair Ailie S. Johnson ’24. “One’s named Donkey. Donkey’s one of my favorites.”
“He has such a funny little personality,” Johnson added. “We have a whole set of them.”
If human interaction is more your speed, Mather holds a biweekly happy hour for students to socialize with other Matherites. “I think our house spirit is very hype,” says Johnson. “Everybody loves living here. We have lots of great attendance for our happy hours. Everybody comes to hang out.”
Mather is a very social environment. Much like a true jungle, it is filled with loud, outgoing, and courageous people. Everybody is different though and there will always be something just right for you. When you need a break from your psets and office hours, there are tranquility rooms where students can take yoga and meditation classes. “I really like the tranquility room,” Anna G. Dean ’25, Mather’s other HoCo Co-Chair said. “We have a wellness center and we have a Wellness Educator who’s a tutor in Mather. It’s very zen there.”
And there are places perfect for partying. “I feel like there’s always a party every Friday, Saturday night,” says Johnson. According to Johnson, the Junior Common Room is a hub for parties hosted by organizations and the residents of Mather.
“Just listen to where the music is,” says Dean.
From puppies to tranquility rooms, Mather is a welcoming, homely, and lively environment. Once you get settled, you will never want to leave.
If you live in Mather, you are living in a perfect world. How do you describe a place so great with so few words? Well to start off, it is imperative that the Mather singles are at the forefront of the conversation. Unlike most houses, if you’re placed in Mather, you are guaranteed a ~luxurious~ single. As a sophomore, you will most likely be placed in Mather low-rise, where you will be gifted a two-story suite with four to five other people and a roomy common space for socializing.
The ensuite common rooms are not the only spacious places in Mather. Upon entering the dining hall, your jaw will drop. Made up of tall ceilings, long windows, and a lot of natural lighting, the dining hall is a beautiful and comfortable space to eat at. And there’s blueberry ice cream! Tell me you aren’t jealous. “It’s really beautiful,” said Dean. “Whenever it’s sunny, you can see the river.” But the Mather dining hall is not only a place to eat, it’s also a great place to socialize. “It’s really comfortable here,” said Johnson. “There’s always people here and I come here and do work. Just because of its good vibes.”
If that wasn’t convincing enough, Mather’s HoCo chairs have more to say about their special jungle.
What song would you relate Mather House to?
ASJ: I feel like Anna and I, we’re not the most pop culture people. What’s that one Pitbull song? Oh, the World one. “Mr. Worldwide.” Oh it’s, it’s on the tip of my tongue.
AGD: “Time of Our Lives” is a good one.
Because if you become a gorilla or a lion, you will have the Time of YOUR Life.
If Mather was a coming-of-age movie, what movie would it be?
ASJ: That’s really deep.
AGD: Do you know the movie “Booksmart”? It’s like a bunch of nerds partying.
JM: And weren’t they also coming to an Ivy as well?
AGD: Yeah. It’s perfect. Perfect movie.
…and perhaps the perfect house…for you.
If Mather was a Hogwarts house, what house would it be?
AGD: Hufflepuff.
ASJ: I was gonna say Hufflepuff. Is that like an insult?
AGD: I’m a Hufflepuff.
ASJ: We are a little quirky and our architecture’s a little quirky, but we’re really fun and nice.
And as we all know, Hufflepuffs throw the best parties!
