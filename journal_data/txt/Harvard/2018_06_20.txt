After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NICE, France—The first to greet me was a palm tree waving hello in a sleepy stupor. After a 15-minute drive through the city under its midnight-blue ceiling, I found myself in a small room stashed in the corner of a woman’s house with several floors: my Airbnb for the next three nights. I wondered what Nice would look like in the morning when the ceiling was of sun. Sure, the night lamps caressed the cars, homes, and passerbys nicely, but there were more details to be seen.
In the morning, everything was open. Clothes and towels hung from little balcony balustrades. You could soak in life simply by seeing all that was hanging about the railings and little balconies while listening to all the sounds bouncing from wall to wall. Later I learned that around dinner time, the aromas of everyone’s meal travel through homes as if they have wanderlust. It is amazing, yet I assume it would be equally torturous if one were starving. Breakfast that first morning was basic but delicious, especially since I was ravished. With an espresso, baguette slices with butter and blueberry jam gave a true kickstart to the unknown day I had ahead. Upon leaving my very temporary home, I wandered south. I passed trees upon trees—all lovely. The same was true for flowers, which blossomed across colors. I would have expected such a place to smell just as lovely. While it didn’t stink, all of my inhalations were traced with tobacco, each varying in strength. Everywhere I went, cigarettes flourished between fingers and cobblestone crevices. They were an accessory and a way of life.
I wandered further and caught a big, lit-up H&M sign. I thought following the sign would lead me to more exciting rues—streets—especially since these big stores never stand alone; they agglomerate. Besides, the plenty of people bustling through that street seemed captured by something more than shopping. It was true; further down that street there was Place Masséna. I was funneled out from rows of stores with train tracks down the middle to this mass courtyard of beauty. Even the floor was beautiful in its grey and cream crooked- and straight-ness. A garden flourished there, and synchronized fountains danced beyond it. Fountains seem to dance all over in Nice. Colorful buildings lined the streets that reached out like arms from their splendid courtyard body. Buildings hugged its southern side, right where the sea sits calmly as bodies enter from and return to rocky shores. There, where the sea sat calmly, I looked into the horizon longing to experience more adventures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some books are not fun to read.
Reading them is like dragging yourself through the floodwaters of your backyard ravine after last night's monsoon showers, a staple of any Tucson July. As you trudge forward, you're constantly pulled back by the tautness of the marshy water, threatened by the spines of the shriveled prickly pear cactus floating among you. But you’ve already made it this far and at this point, there’s no turning back. The only option is to keep going.George Orwell’s "1984" is no different.
The setting is overcast, after a midsummer storm. Characters ebb and flow like flash floods, their disappearances and reappearances unexplained by the totalitarian superstate of Oceania, its own alliances as fickle as the daily forecast in July. A cult of personality has made its descent on the remains of London—now known as Airstrip One—giving rise to a ruthless dictatorship in which civil liberties are curtailed to the maximum and each citizen’s will to live is reduced to serving the government, also known as the Party. The narrative is at once unabashedly devastating and vitally refreshing, like a Sonoran Desert thunderstorm making a sudden appearance after months of drought. It’s hard to digest.But some books are necessary.The society described in “1984”—a world in which humans’ capacity for original thought is confined through increasingly-simplistic diction, in which the past is more mutable than the future, in which facts are denuded of irrevocable meaning—is a stone’s throw from the one in which we live today.Modern truncation of language, rife in the brevity of text messages and tweets, is not far off from Newspeak—the Party’s preferred mode of communication, a language characterized by the utmost level of concision. Like the fictitious citizens of Oceania, people today increasingly drop vowels and consonants from the simplest of sentences in a quest to streamline conversation, sometimes, only to salvage one or two letters.
Newspeak strips the English language of its descriptive vibrancy, replacing centuries of evolving linguistic beauty with unabashed simplicity. “Horrifying” becomes “ungood,” “marvelous” becomes “plusgood,” “superior” becomes “doubleplusgood,” and so on. But the devolution of the four-letter “love” to the three-letter “luv” is a relatively innocuous symptom of a much more insidious phenomenon, one present in our own society: the death of meaningful discourse.
What is most concerning about Newspeak lies not in its promotion of brevity (which, in itself, bears echoes of modern texting language), but rather, in its advocacy of restraint. Through Newspeak, language becomes austere, robbing its users of their ability to express a full range of human emotion, to engage in rewarding discussions with one another beyond prescribed modes of communication.
Today’s world is no different. We live our lives in front of screens, anxiously awaiting the endorsement of others in the form of preordained reactions on social media—hearts, thumbs-ups, emojis, and so on. Our most meaningful modes of interpersonal engagement have devolved into the Pavlovian clicks of a “like” button—the action itself coming to symbolize a litmus test for friendship, an indicator of boundless affection, an emblem of irrevocable loyalty.
We obsess over who among our glut of online friends views our Snapchat and Instagram stories, because in a wading pool of such undemanding gestures we have somehow come to find an ocean of meaning. We conclude text messages with smiley faces, “lols,” and “hahas” to imbue them with an equivocal tone, afraid to pose questions that might unsettle, make comments that might disturb. We hesitate to take risks with language, to let our words occupy the full breadth of the space they deserve.
Whether it’s asking for clarification or telling someone how we feel, we mask our vulnerabilities with the inviting veneer of emojis, sincerely hoping the other person will “get the message.” But in doing so, we withhold our own humanity from the threshold of dialogue, tucking it away in a corner with the rest of our emotions that refuse to be categorized. We let our conversations proceed with an unsettling staccato—devoid of nuance, of spark, of tension, because we are afraid of what could happen if we reveal ourselves completely.
As communication becomes increasingly digitized, people will undoubtedly continue to seek connections with one another online. But if we aspire to do so meaningfully, we need to learn how to use our words again. With the ever-growing English language at our fingertips, it’s far from impossible.
Perhaps we must turn back to books as a first step, dare to immerse ourselves in prescient tales of what happens when we are forced into psychological austerity, robbed of the capability to express ourselves creatively. Orwell’s magnum opus is a reminder: Newspeak is effectively a drought, bereaving the citizens of Oceania of intellectual and emotional capacities. And its modern variant, manifest in the rigid prescriptions of online communication, threatens to do the same to us—unless we fight to restore the nuance of language.
So let the storm come. Let it ravage an atmosphere tainted with aridity, blessing our discourse with moisture and meaning through each of its howls. Let it unshackle the stiff confines of human connection. Let it replenish our collective wellspring of humanity.
Above all, let it sow the seeds of vibrant dialogue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 33 percent of legacy applicants—Harvard hopefuls with at least one parent who graduated from the College or Radcliffe—gained admission to the Classes of 2014 through 2019, according to documents filed Friday in an admissions lawsuit against the University.
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions—who first brought the lawsuit against Harvard in 2014—points to the University’s long-controversial consideration of legacy status in admissions processes in their court filings.  The admission rate of legacy applicants is over five times that of non-legacy students, according to one filing.
In each of the admitted Classes of 2007 through 2016, the number of accepted legacy students has been greater than the number of first-generation students, senior fellow at The Century Foundation Richard D. Kahlenberg wrote in another filing submitted by SFFA.
In addition, SFFA’s expert witness, Duke professor Peter S. Arcidiacono, found the preference given to legacy students disproportionately favors white students.
In his filings, he claimed more than 21.5 percent of white admitted students are also legacy admits. Around 6.96 percent of Hispanic admits, 6.63 percent of Asian-American admits, and 4.79 percent of African-American admits were students with legacy status, according to Arcidiacono’s analysis.
Opponents of Harvard’s admissions practices have previously criticized the advantage legacy preferences give to certain students. A Feb. 2018 letter sent to college and university administrators across the country by signatories of the EdMobilizer Coalition, a first-generation student advocacy group supported by organizations at many elite universities, called for more transparency in the use of “legacy preferences” in the college admissions process.
“Today, the lasting impact of these practices reaches far beyond higher education, helping to reinforce cycles of class inequity and hampering economic mobility in America,” the letter read.
In SFFA’s filing, Arcidiacono concluded that his statistical modeling indicates “removing legacy preferences would increase the number of admitted Asian Americans,” in addition to the number of admitted students from other racial groups.
Expert witnesses and lawyers for the University dispute the validity of Arcidiacono’s methodology, calling his statistical arguments “deeply flawed” in one of their own filings.
But Harvard has not disputed the preference given to legacy students. A 2013 internal study, made public in the Friday documents, found a strong positive association between legacy status and an individual applicant’s odds of admission.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 previously defended the “tip” he says his office gives to legacy applicants—which he described in a 2011 interview as a “self-selecting group.”
“If you look at the credentials of Harvard alumni and alumnae sons and daughters, they are better candidates on average,” Fitzsimmons said. “Very few who apply have no chance of getting in.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane referred to a statement on the Admissions Office website about whether likelihood of admission is “enhanced if a relative has attended Harvard.”
“The application process is the same for all candidates,” the statement reads. “Among a group of similarly distinguished applicants, the daughters and sons of Harvard College alumni/ae may receive an additional look.”
In their filings, lawyers for the University offered another reason for the consideration of legacy status in admissions, arguing it is necessary for maintaining a relationship between alumni and the College.
Consideration of legacy status “cements strong bonds between the College and its alumni and encourages alumni to remain engaged with the University for the rest of their lives,” Harvard’s submission reads.
SFFA argued in its own filings that the consideration of legacy status persists because University wants to secure financial gifts from alumni donors.
“Harvard gives preferences to legacies because it fears wealthy alumni may stop donating money and other assets to Harvard if their children no longer receive preferences,” SFFA’s filing reads.
A few pages of the Friday filings provide details about a group of applicants commonly referred to as the “Z-list”—that is, those students who receive offers of admission each year following waitlist acceptances, provided they take a gap year prior to matriculating at the College. For the Classes of 2014 through 2019, this list was composed of 46.5 percent legacy students.
