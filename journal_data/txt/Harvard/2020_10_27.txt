Yaa Gyasi’s second novel, “Transcendent Kingdom,” is an intimate look into the life of Gifty, a Ghanian-American neuroscience doctoral student at Stanford. The novel follows Gifty’s efforts to coax her mother out of a depressive episode as she completes the final year of her doctoral program. This novel crafts a raw analysis of religion, mental illness, and addiction through the lens of a uniquely authentic character.
The story oscillates between anecdotes of Gifty’s life leading up to her undergraduate years and her current studies. These stories are often paired with her childhood journal entries that bridge her present to her past, revealing the trip to Ghana when her mother first fell into catatonic depression and the day Gifty was saved in church.
Gifty’s childhood allows Gyasi to project deeply philosophical reflections upon her character. The dimensionality of Gifty’s perspectives make her character so incredibly convincing that it's hard to believe that this is a novel to begin with. Gifty’s childhood turned her into a colder and detached person, which she later transforms into curiosity and experimentation. Through her scientific doctoral work, Gifty seeks out answers concerning the mental health of her mother, her brother's addiction, and her relationship with God. Yet, science alone does not fulfill Gifty, and throughout the novel she finds her answers in unconventional means.
“Transcendent Kingdom” is a story that will stick with you. It won’t fill your mind with wonder and adornment for the strength of the characters, but it is undeniably heart-breaking, and it will give you the opportunity to reflect. Gyasi’s writing forces us to reconsider the notions we hold about sensitive topics like addiction and mental illness. Gifty studies neuroscience to understand why her brother could not kick his heroin habit, and she studies herself to understand how it affected her.
By reading Gifty’s accounts, we begin to learn as well. Her introspections can be used as a foundation for a similar self-examination. Although Gifty is a complex and uncommon character, her struggles can easily be resonated with and that opens the window for self-reflection. She even went to Harvard for her undergraduate degree, and while her experiences are fictional, she comes off as your average Harvard student. Beyond that, her childhood as the daughter of an immigrant family is an accurate and poignant illustration that many can identify with.
“Transcendent Kingdom” does have specific and distinct characters, but that should not deter anyone from reading this novel. For those looking for an exciting and thrilling plot, this may not be a great fit. There is great rhythm in the writing, but it is more of a slow-burn, especially towards the middle.
Another thing of note: religion is heavily emphasized in the work since it was such an integral part of Gifty’s life. The majority of the second half centers around Evangelical Christianity. The narrative shifts its focus towards Gifty’s reconciliation with her faith in light of her mother’s depression. Nonetheless, the discussion of Christianity is not a jaded one, nor is it biased. Rather, it offers an insight into the place that religion has in a scientific world, where the ends of scientific inquiry often turn to philosophy.
Yaa Gyasi’s sophomore novel is a deviation from her previous work, “Homegoing”, but she succeeds tremendously in portraying a character rich in depth, emotion, and determination that is unlike much else out there.

“My capacity for imaging a violence flexes like a membrane. Like a girl. I would / call it red,” Lucia LoTempio writes in “Hot With The Bad Things,” a lyric poem spanning 70-odd pages that explores the shockwaves of sexual and physical violence in LoTempio’s life and community.
The new book is both an expression and repudiation of LoTempio’s own “capacity for imaging violence,” as an author and a survivor of abuse. Bringing the reader into the flashback terror of her nightmares, LoTempio’s speaker moves through the world hyper-aware of possible harm, showing that her “red” imagination is a survival measure — she draws on past trauma to preempt future danger. Yet LoTempio’s speaker is not the only one with the capacity to image tragedy — a high-profile murder-suicide in her college town illustrates to LoTempio’s speaker the public’s fixation with consuming violence against women as a spectacle, preventing any substantive awareness of abuse.
From the book’s first line, LoTempio adeptly juxtaposes the reality of violence with its distortion in pop culture. The book’s first line is “The man says, ‘Alone on a bus? That’s how a horror movie starts.’ But it feels more / imaginable, tomorrow rather than a screen.” For LoTempio’s speaker, the possibility of violence remains intimate and immediate, lurking behind an unlocked door; she sleeps with a knife at arm’s reach beside her pillow. But for the leering observers (like the man on the bus) who appear throughout the book, the possibility of violence is akin to a movie plot, only distantly observed.
As LoTempio’s lyric unfolds, her thematic work becomes more and more engrossing, tangling the speaker’s past and future as she traces the imprint of trauma. Her discussion of the aforementioned murder-suicide is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the lyric, as LoTempio only ever describes the murder in vague, straightforward terms without reference to the name or life story of anyone involved. While the nonspecificity of the story (introduced as “the man murdered the girl and her new lover,” then barely elaborated on) is initially jarring and incongruous with the descriptive depth of LoTempio’s writing, it became clear that it is a deliberate attempt to avoid over-imaging a woman’s death which had already been plastered in the papers and across Facebook pages. Instead, LoTempio zeroes in on the public response — in one of the standout segments of the lyric, she breaks her usual prose-poem style to highlight the skewed societal discussion about the murder:
“When a girl is killed … /.../ When the girl
was killed in Geneseo When her ex
killed her When the man killed her
When he stabbed her /.../
When / at the memorial When they don’t
mention her When iced
with blame”
Through these almost dissociative fragments, LoTempio points out how society’s “memorials” to murdered women essentially erase them except to fault them for abuse, allowing the cycle of violence to continue without collective recognition of its causes.
LoTempio’s project in “Hot With The Bad Things” seems to be to counter this pattern of erasure through an intimate portrayal of the aftermath of violence. It details her speaker’s struggle to regain agency by naming her emotions and finding some outlet that will let her move past them, shaking off the burden of past experience. LoTempio weaves the speaker’s evolving efforts to find some kind of solution throughout the book, leading to some of its most resonant lines. “I’m jealous of anger,” she writes, “I want to be / ⬤ [a symbol she uses in place of her abuser’s name] when he couldn’t get the bartender’s attention. I want to throw the menu, / shout, kick things, shake a person by the soldiers, and not have the person / be me.”
Ultimately, “Hot With the Bad Things” is most impressive thematically, delivering a nuanced exploration of violence on the personal and public level that is similar to (but distinct and branching off from) Olivia Gatwood’s popular, true-crime inspired 2019 collection “Life of the Party” about fear and girlhood.
There are, however, many moments in LoTempio’s lyric where it becomes difficult to follow, dipping into overly-obscured, opaque phrases and structures (for example, a random passage on grease fires late in the book, with no mention of the fires elsewhere: “When I see a grease fire, it’s a trash fire, it’s a car engine fire, it’s on the belly of a great lake…. I know I shouldn’t be filling any cup to splash. When I say grease fire, I mean nothing else.”) These moments distract from LoTempio’s usually compelling narrative structure, as does a segment in the middle where the speaker writes letters to her younger self about a former lover (potentially her abuser, although it is unclear) with lines like “He says my love grows from a big space to an even bigger space” that drift away from the book’s focus.
Despite these moments of confusion, the lyric succeeds as a contemporary feminist work weaving together complex social and personal topics with formal creativity and ringing, beautiful phrasing. LoTempio draws the reader into engrossing conversation with the book from its first page — indeed, the finishing line of page one geniusly introduces the reader to the premise of the book, displaying LoTempio’s unique style of intimate urgency. “Listen,” she beckons, “if nothing goes to plan, imagine it as bad as possible.”

“I’m just working hard, learning how to listen.”
Save for a few ventures, Ira Sadoff is a lifelong resident of New York. Sadoff is also an extremely accomplished and distinguished poet, a talent that has earned him critical acclaim and numerous accolades. In his most recent work, a collection of poems entitled “Country, Living,” Sadoff explores exactly the two things defined in the title: his country and his life.
In a single line, Sadoff is able to seamlessly guide the reader to a place, physical or otherwise. All of a sudden, his poems jump from the page to a far off land, where he captures the feeling of the setting in just a handful of words — all the while perfectly crafting the emotional response that each poem is meant to induce. Writing about Sadoff’s writing seems an unfair and impossible task because it is just that elegant and well-crafted. Sadoff is able to simply paint a picture of imagery, setting, description, emotion, and story with one broad brushstroke.
Alongside his poetic patchwork of defining and portraying life, Sadoff offers commentary on the condition and history of the United States in an interluding section titled “My Country.” This scathing cataloguing of failures of the United States in terms of its injustices and its culture of obtuse excess and consumption under capitalism is sandwiched between sections depicting the essence of life — thereby expressing that these societal problems cannot be extracted or removed from even the most florid, poetic, and amorphous conversations about living. Sadoff describes and criticizes class inequalities, the toxicity of fame, and the systemic racism in U.S. history and in the country today. Whilst this section is demonstrably about the entire nation, Sadoff still interjects stories, rather darker in effect, about living in these imperilling conditions — exploring small town living, grief, and the effects of capitalism on the individual.
The only moment where his infectious and radical condemnation of the country comes across as confusing at first glance is in the poem “The Defeat of Brooklyn,'' which opens with a Louis Armstrong quote about being “white inside.” Sadoff references this quote in the body of the poem by saying that the speaker, taking the form of a soldier conversing with George Washington following the defeat of Brooklyn, is “black. I mean inside out.” Explaining that this is because “we too have been beaten, have been slaves to buying and selling, we too hated our masters,” almost seeming as if he were comparing the ‘slavery’ of capitalism to American’s violent history of enslavement.
Upon further inspection, it seems as though this line is actually a critique of the very claim it seems to be exemplifying. Sadoff is critiquing the act of modern Americans conflating any struggles other than slavery with slavery. The message is important, but the delivery tows the line of requiring too much attention and being disastrously misinterpreted. With poetry, second reading is not a fault of the poem or the poet; in fact many poems tell a different story after reading the second time. When the first reading seems to compare enslavement with capitalism, however, things become somewhat troubling. Most of Sadoff’s poems are straightforward enough that the first reading reveals their general themes and ideas, which makes this confusion all the more jarring. Given Sadoff’s deep aversion to inequality and the immorality of America’s past and present, it is clear that this line is not what it looks like at face value and that, to be in agreement with Sadoff’s views, it requires a second reading and more attentive interpretation.
This collection is littered with quotes from a variety of sources. Some poems begin with quotes that relate to the content and the third section is entirely titled and prefaced by a Gabrielle Roth quote. Throughout the collection, Sadoff references and even fictionally encounters numerous thinkers, artists, musicians, and composers from history — almost as if to say that living is synthesizing the thoughts of people who have come before. “In the end maybe you get one idea to keep to yourself, but who’s to say it’s yours?” This recurring injection of quotes and ideas from historical and contemporary notables is Sadoff paying homage to those who gave him the inspiration for the ideas that he gets to present in his poetry.
Sadoff’s third section delves back into poems about living. There is not necessarily a narrative arc to this collection, but there is a cohesive and natural flow of the poems. The collection begins by introducing the reader to the speaker, who can be inferred to be Sadoff himself. Sadoff displays himself, then explicates his thoughts and observations about the world, all the while continuing to intersperse the collection with bits about his life and the concept and universality of living.
In “Country, Living,” Sadoff conveys the power of reflecting on the present through the lens of his past. Sadoff is eminently living in the moment, not worrying about the future or dwelling on the past. This collection expertly crafts a picture of life whilst packing the punch of social commentary. It is able to describe life in its fullness, complexity, and broadness. Sadoff shows through this series of examples just how much there is to learn from living, “Who cares about an afterlife? This life overflows the way a thaw floods a muddy river.”

As Halloween season approaches, viewers everywhere reflexively pull out their trusted list of spooky favorites. But what about those films that aren’t categorized as horror but still possess the capacity to deeply disrupt and disturb? This eclectic list challenges and expands viewers’ understanding of truly chilling cinema.
5. “Spotlight” (Tom McCarthy, 2015)
There’s something chilling about a well-concealed truth slowly being forced to the surface of societal consciousness. This drama film follows the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team as they attempt to uncover the extensive history and concealment of child sex abuse within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. With a star-studded cast including Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Rachel McAdams, this film probes the darker side of institutions that are not as consecrated as they initially seem. There’s nothing overtly violent or gory about “Spotlight” — that, however, is precisely what makes it so harrowing. From the calm complexions of priests that belie their crimes to the gradual emergence of survivor after survivor, this gripping, candid account of a momentous uncovering will have you on the edge of your seat.
4. “Alice in Wonderland” (Tim Burton, 2010)
As much as fantasy enchants, it also has the capacity to disturb. Particularly for younger viewers, Tim Burton’s sensational adaptation of Lewis Caroll’s famed novel boasts a resplendent universe of high castles, talking animals, and psychotic queens. Johnny Depp’s chilling portrayal of the Mad Hatter is at once disconcerting and inexplicably endearing, further elevating the delightfully outlandish and ominous elements of the film. Burton accentuates the disturbing qualities of the text’s iconic characters — including the ghastly grin of the Cheshire Cat and the oversized head of the sadistic Red Queen — to jarring effect. Despite its PG rating, “Alice in Wonderland” possesses an eeriness coupled with a subtle melancholy that has the capacity to haunt children and adults alike.
3. “No Country for Old Men” (Coen Brothers, 2007)
Centered on two simultaneous manhunts, one conducted by the Texan police force and the other by a rogue killer, “No Country for Old Men” is arguably the most compelling film ever directed by the Coen brothers. Grisly homicide and masterful suspense are more than cinematic gimmicks; they illustrate a subversive cat-and-mouse game between criminals and the police, as well as the palpable paranoia that follows in its wake. Javier Bardem’s Academy Award-winning embodiment of Anton Chigurh, a brutal killer with a chilling indifference to agony, is what makes the film so enduringly disturbing. In its refusal to extend a clear argument about the preservation of human good, “No Country for Old Men” foreshadows a grim posterity. Winning Best Picture at a riotously competitive Academy Awards — it beat out Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood,” another sensational film with similar moral conundrums — the film stuns its viewership into sobering rumination.
2. “Burning” (Lee Chang-dong, 2018)
The plot of this mystery-drama is deceptively simple. An aspiring writer named Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) meets Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo), whom he knew in high school. Shortly after reconnecting, Hae-mi goes on a trip to Africa that she has been saving up for. Upon her return, she is accompanied by a mysterious man known simply as Ben (Steven Yeun). As Jong-su spends more time with the two, he is forced to grapple with the unsettling, ambiguous nature of Hae-mi and Ben’s relationship, culminating in Hae-mi’s eventual disappearance. Adding to the harrowing effect is the swift replacement of Hae-mi with another young woman and the slow-burn reveal of Ben’s sociopathic tendencies. Perhaps the most eerie aspect of “Burning” is that everything — the images presented, the words spoken, the activities referred to — stand for something else. The film’s landscapes are largely mundane: storefronts, diners, a stretch of countryside bordering North Korea. It is the seemingly ordinary nature of the characters combined with their private perversions that unnerves most of all.
1. “Sesame Street”
As a kid, you loved it. As you grow older, you look back at these whimsical characters with mounting horror. Were their eyes always that glazed over? Did their voices always sound that maniacal? Although “Sesame Street” is not a film, the beloved franchise deserves a spot on this list — there’s something subtly sinister about the humanoid creatures that haunt our childhood memories. Whether it be the vapid death stare of Big Bird, the crazed grumblings of Cookie Monster, or the purple skin of Count von Count, “Sesame Street” hosts a bizarre cast that often does more to traumatize than to entertain. The erratic nods of heads and the lumbering gaits of these giant puppets are reminiscent of a childhood-classic-turned-horror-movie. Viewers often find themselves polarized over the franchise’s unsettling and lovable qualities: Most seem to settle for a happy middle.

Tana French’s “The Searcher” follows the story of a man who is very much normal and almost completely unremarkable. After living life in Chicago as a detective, he is ready to break out of the mold of American life and find some peace and quiet. His wife has left him and his daughter speaks to him only in bursts; he has nothing left in the states. So, he leaves. He packs up what little he has and finds a quaint rundown homestead in a podunk Irish township. Leaving his entire life behind, Cal Hooper searches for a respite after years of pain. What he finds is far more messy and convoluted than he could have imagined, in a town with barely a store and only dirt roads.
Through immaculate descriptions of the Irish countryside, French captivates the reader and pulls them into the tumultuous and exciting world of rural Ireland. We meet our protagonist walking onto his porch to see the brutality of the Irish countryside in full swing, as several rooks huddle together eating a little field rabbit. This quick scene introduces the reader to the harshness of the Irish landscape in rural Ardnakelty and to our main character, all the while foreshadowing what the remaining 450 pages have to offer.
Following a brief introduction to the location and characters, the reader is swept into the hidden mystery surrounding the disappearance of Brendan Reddy — a kid from the wrong side of town who vanished six months prior to the beginning of “The Searcher.” At the urging of Trey, sibling to the missing child, Cal tentatively embarks on what will become a paradigm shifting adventure in his not-so-quaint and cozy little town.
As French moves through the story, establishing the few and influential characters of the little township, Ardnakelty swiftly grows in the reader’s mind, as Noreen’s little shop, Sean Og’s pub, and the couple houses scattered about are introduced and developed.
The town is but one part of the whole picture established in “The Searcher.” “The sky, dappled in subtle gradations of gray, goes on forever; so do the fields, coded in shades of green by their different uses, divided up by sprawling hedges, dry-stone walls, and the odd narrow back road.” The concise descriptions of the landscape and events illuminate the progression of the story as clearly as watching it with one’s own eyes. French has an incredible ability to create clear, enthralling scenes in places many readers can’t imagine. The low Irish mountains surround the town on the horizon and act as a constant reminder to Cal and the reader of the weight and darkness that seems to seep into the story at every corner, the mystery only growing. The gentle greys of the sky and soft blues of morning sunsets quickly give way to the machinations of generations-old feuds and qualms.
What French creates — purposefully or not — is a world away from the chaos and mess of today. Cal Hooper and the rest of Ardnakelty have no shortage of problems and difficulties — sheep dying mysteriously and siblings disappearing, but these problems seem so tangible, so apparent and solvable with the help of the deus ex machina that is Cal Hooper. Tana French gives readers the potential to see a new, wonderful world in Ardnakelty while also escaping the struggles of the real world. There’s no pandemic in “The Searcher,” and what a relief it is to see and feel it if only for a couple hundred pages.

“Witch” is the latest collection of poems published by Philip Matthews, an enigmatic writer from North Carolina who published his first collection, “Wig Heavier than a Boot,” last year. Full of cryptic language laden with symbolism, “Witch” puts on full display Matthews’ fondness of mystery and experimental form, but in his attempt to create a work set apart by its subtlety and subtext, Matthews presents the reader with a work that is instead an off-putting and laborious read.
The pages of “Witch” are filled front to back with unrhyming, free-verse poetry that takes on a variety of forms as Matthews experiments with grammatical rules, line length, and line spacing. The language he uses to express his eclectic thoughts is often grotesque and crude, and rarely are the images he paints calm or picturesque; instead, they are as violent and senseless as nightmares, and bring together concepts like sex and religion in ways that are rarely voiced, and even more rarely published.
None of this is, of course, problematic in of itself: Art needs not conform, and in fact intrinsically resists the conventional. But in an attempt to tap into the artistic genius that he undoubtedly believes himself to possess, Matthews writes poetry that is just too much of everything he hopes to accomplish: it is too cryptic, too experimental, at times too long, and always too confusing. And while some recognizable motifs do manage to make themselves stand out by the end of the work, there is always too much going on for the reader to truly grasp what is happening. Indeed, simply pinning down what exactly is happening in any given poem is rarely possible.
Perhaps this may appeal to the rare erudite scholar researching the representation of the troubled human psyche in contemporary poetry; for everyone else, the end result is just a headache.
Ironically enough, the flaws in Matthews’ writing are made most clear by those few poems in which he does well; such poems include “A New Function,” “Election Day,” and “The Holy Ghost.” These pieces of work, which are among the better poems in the collection, stand out because — while not by any means straightforward — they are at least decipherable. Here, Matthews limits himself in length to about one page or less, limits the amount with which he plays with the rules of grammar, and limits himself in diction to words that, while blasphemous, violent[,] or extreme, still find themselves in the realm of the understandable in the context of the poem. The result is something that is actually readable; unfortunately, the restraint shown by Matthews in these works is the exception rather than the norm.
Take, for instance, the poem “Crown and Crowning.” At eight pages long, it is certainly not what would be considered a concise poem; however, upon reading it, one is made to feel as if it is as long as the “Iliad.” This sensation is brought on by Matthews’ use of phrases that are purposefully opaque, combined with imagery that he perhaps thought was creative, but is ultimately downright confusing. The first lines, for example, read as follows: “Fatty wind I walk into / hand over my belly. As the cattle inside me move. / I give it a name. Tongue resting outside of its owner.” This pattern of short broken sentences continues for the entirety of the poem, which also sees images as disparate as “a school,” “a slowly unfurling hydrangea,” “an oil spill,” “a cancerous alley,” and “a money’s belly” (whatever that is) all being juxtaposed together in the same stanza.
And while one could say that it is not unusual in poetry for the writer to ask the reader to connect these symbols on their own, the length of the poem means that the reader is forced to constantly look back in order to somehow make sense of this thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle of symbols. The process is exhausting and tests the reader’s patience, especially since, at the end of each stanza, one has trouble remembering and understanding what happened at its beginning, much less at the beginning of the entire poem.
This is not to disparage the themes that Matthews has set out to convey, all of which revolve around an individual’s struggle to reconcile his sexual identity with the expectations that he faces from the family and religion that surround him. These are conflicts that, of course, are as relevant to the modern world as ever; it is just that the poems could’ve been written better. Even the least bit more clarity would have helped.
In the end, even if Matthews’ goal was to put to paper a series of images that speak to the senselessness, violence, and vulgarity of the conflicted mind, his poems lack the structure and refinement to be understood and effectively get his point across. The beauty of language lies in the clarity of expression it affords us; Matthews’ “Witch” is, at best, a good reminder of this fact.

Today, roughly six months since colleges were first shut down, it has become socially unacceptable to party, share White Claws, or let eight strangers hit your Juul. It is still okay, however, to spend six hours a day on TikTok… right? That being the case, it only feels natural to rank five of the most popular TikTok clips that won’t stop appearing and reappearing on everyone’s “For You Page.”
5. Who painted the Mona Lisa? Yeah, the Mona Lisa.
“Da Vinki?” takes last place. Short-lived and niche, this TikTok is a four out of ten on a good day. Can you reenact it while you struggle through your problem set? Sure, but why would you want to? It was only funny in the original video. This one only made the list because every time I hear it, I scroll past. At least it helps me get through my “For You Page” quicker.
4. I am fucking crazy, but I’m free.
Did you know the audio comes from Lana Del Rey? Anyways, this one gets a solid six out of ten. Drunk college kids who walk through alleys at night seem to enjoy recreating this audio, so let’s live vicariously through them.
3. Are you not ashamed of yourself?
“Are you not embarrassed? This is embarrassing.” Yes, with the accent. Easy to use when your friend redownloads Tinder — or when you get your midterm grade back. Yikes. At least you can still watch TikToks through the tears. Seven out of ten.
2. Hey… hey.
No, not the one with the shaky voice. This is the one that goes, “Mmmmm, hey! Hey.” Do you know what I’m talking about? Whatever. This TikTok is a solid eight out of ten. Perfect for when you are lingering in your suitemate’s doorway and want them to entertain you. Just repeat this audio until they kick you out.
1. Yes I did that! And you would do it too for a check.
“I was an employee, and I was gonna get employee of the month, and that’s on period!” takes the cake. Ten out of ten on a good day, bad day, and mediocre day. The things we would do for a check are concerning, according to TikTok, but let’s just blame it on capitalism. And also Karl Marx, somehow.

“Dancing With the Stars” belongs to that special class of reality television whose sole mission is to bolster the fame and fortune of existing celebrities rather than fashion them from scratch. “DWTS” can count Bindi Irwin, Rumer Willis, one-time teen idol Donny Osmond, and Drew Lachey, younger brother of Nick Lachey, among its many esteemed winners — as well as a perhaps unfair number of former professional athletes. Since 2005, the show’s charm lies in the eclectic mix of B-list celebrities who willingly waltz their way onto ABC’s lacquered, career-reviving ballroom floor.
I have never actively watched Dancing With the Stars, but I begrudgingly tuned in for the Season 29 premiere after a glance at the show’s lineup revealed a venerable murderer’s row of the past year’s biggest names in television. Chrishell Stause from “Selling Sunset?” Monica Aldama from “Cheer?” Carole Baskin from that low-budget indie documentary about barnyard cats?
Throw in Justina Machado from the wonderful “One Day at a Time,” which Pop TV revived in 2019 (only for its new season to air on CBS, funnily enough), and an interesting picture coalesces. “Dancing With the Stars,” one of ABC’s landmark primetime properties, has put together a deep bench of… Netflix stars. And these women are all the quarterbacks of their respective star-making properties, not the tight ends (shoutout to their “DWTS” co-star Vernon Davis, who is, in fact, a former NFL tight end). Watch Monica Aldama confidently dance the samba to “Party in the U.S.A.,” for example, and one can’t help but recall her commanding performance as herself, the U.S.A.’s foremost college cheerleading coach in “Cheer.” Before her elimination from the show last week, Carole Baskin managed to squeeze in dances to “Eye of the Tiger,” “What’s New Pussycat,” and “Circle of Life,” reifying “Tiger King” in our collective imagination just at the twilight of its COVID-era relevance. And even though the third season of “Selling Sunset” was just released, Chrishell Stause’s endearingly mediocre dance skills make me want to watch her flee Christine Quinn’s goth Barbie wedding all over again. My only salient thought while watching the “DWTS” premiere was that I should turn off ABC and reload Netflix.
It’s somewhat disconcerting to watch streaming stars flock to network television and not the other way around, as if our engorged but well-defined television matrix is finally short-circuiting. Fidgeting in front of the “DWTS” judging panel without the gloss of a Netflix production budget, they look, startlingly, like real people. Any coherent meaning of “event viewing” has eroded in the past decade; momentary mastery of the late-stage entertainment production economy has proved elusive even for the new guard. “DWTS,” in all its sweaty and unironic glory, might have once considered itself event viewing, and now may be a harbinger of things to come. Perhaps what awaits us, in a vaguely apocalyptic world, are these sorts of reverse-engineered attempts at restoring unity to the cultural landscape.
But the scales remain tipped. The Netflix empire, having stripped millions of eyeballs away from network television, is now physically invading its territory. This is part of what makes watching Netflix stars sashay it up on ABC so perplexing, even uncomfortable. It feels like an admittance of defeat. This collaboration may appear to be consensual, but make no mistake: Netflix has won.
Well, almost — looking for all 22 seasons of new host Tyra Banks’ former gig “America’s Next Top Model?” Those, blessedly, are on Hulu.

At the center of Bryan Washington’s “Memorial” are Mike and Ben. Mike is a Japanese-American chef and Ben is an African-American daycare helper. The story begins when Mike’s mother, Mitsuko, comes from Japan to visit him in Houston. On the same day, Mike takes a flight to Japan to visit with his dying father, Eiju, leaving Ben and Mitsuko, who have never met, to share an apartment until his unspecified return. The book is divided in two halves: one about Ben and Mitsuko living in Houston, and the other about Mike and his father in Osaka.
Thematically, “Memorial” is politically relevant, dealing with issues such as race, sexuality, gentrification, immigration, and social media. However, the meat of the story lies in parent-child relationships. Questions of race and sexuality merely serve as the backdrop for a family story. With this format, Washington has surpassed other contemporary literature — he has written a book about an interracial gay couple that is not primarily about race or sexuality. As a gay man, I found it refreshing to read about gay characters leading a “normal life,” without constantly hearing about how they are gay. Washington eschews explicit overreliance on individual identity as he chases that intangible essence of what it means to be human.
Unfortunately, “Memorial” comes up short structurally and stylistically. Since the bulk of the novel is split into two parts, one in Houston and one in Osaka, the reader loses sight of whichever story has been put on the backburner. Alternating chapters going back and forth between the two plotlines would have made the story more engaging. Washington tries to tie the two halves together by threading bits and pieces of Ben and Mike’s text messages throughout the novel. These smatterings of texts appear in both Ben and Mike’s section, so that the reader can contextualize the conversation from both points of view. Although using Ben and Mike’s text conversation as a throughline is an interesting idea, it ultimately falls flat because the conversation itself is so empty. Ben and Mike text each other infrequently, and when they do, the conversation is trivial and does not seem to be inspired by the events going on in the story. The most exciting texts we get are a question about grocery shopping and a spur-of-the-moment photograph. Without a solid linkage, the story in Houston and the story in Osaka feel isolated from one another.
In both Ben and Mike’s half of the novel, much of the narrative is split into short scenes. Washington gives a smattering of brief fragmented stories in hopes that they will come together to tell a bigger story. For example, Washington sprinkles several lists throughout Mike’s section: “A few of Eiju’s favorite things,” “Eiju’s favorite sounds,” “A brief list of Eiju’s favorite scents,” “Things [Mike’s] cooked for his father,” etc. “Memorial” reads almost like a collage. But since there are so many of these short excerpts, they begin to feel trite and maudlin. These bits of prose are not honed down enough to be poetry, yet they are not expanded upon enough to hold the emotional weight of other, longer prose. Stuck somewhere between poetry and short story, the individual scenes of “Memorial” start to lose power after a while, preventing it from reaching its full potential.

Justin Bieber has entered his God phase, but he also loves fossil fuels. In his catchy new song, “Holy,” featuring Chance the Rapper, Bieber praises the Lord for the love he’s found — presumably referencing wife Hailey Baldwin Bieber, although the music video suggests his true passion is fracking.
Bieber released the music video for the track on Sept. 17, and as if this year couldn’t get any more chaotic, the video tells a story that has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the song or Bieber’s own life. The opening shot sets the scene with a placard that says “Motel” on a bedside table, then fades to the title card: written in a biblically gothic font, transposed over the figure of Jesus Christ on a motel crucifix. It’s all a bit heavy-handed.
Bieber then wakes up in bed beside a woman who is definitely not his IRL wife, Hailey Bieber. He gets ready to embark on his workday at — get this — an oil drilling “plant” (as it is described by the foreman in a scene we’ll touch on shortly.)
In the next sequence, the camera pans in on the oil plant, giving off major “There Will Be Blood” vibes as it is bathed in an intense, sepia-toned wash. Cut to an incredibly greasy Bieber standing around, singing, whilst his coworkers extract oil. Seriously, he’s SO greasy: The video’s budget seems to have been redirected from narrative planning to the obscene amount of oil they smear on JB’s face to show that he really is just like your average fracker.
At this point, we’re given a glimpse of the warm, kindhearted nature of JB’s fictional paramour, who is caring for the elderly in a nursing home. It’s important to note that nobody at said nursing home is remotely taking coronavirus precautions. Instead, they are just playing Bingo and vibing — raising the question of whether this is a pre-COVID timepiece, a modern sans-COVID AU, or just an anti-mask propaganda piece.
This question becomes all the more ambiguous when JB’s foreman delivers the news that they are shutting down the plant due to the “current and ongoing global situation.” What other “global situation” could they be referring to besides the pandemic? Climate change, possibly? The ruination of God’s green Earth, spurred on by the very oil that JB was extracting only moments before? Or, more hopefully, is it a shift away from fossil fuels, potentially placing the JB “Holy” timeline in a universe after the upcoming election where Joe Biden wins and uses his influence to push for green energy?
We get no answers. The only conclusion is that the Justin Bieber “Holy” video is just a love letter to Exxon. Seriously, this reeks of Big Oil money. Is BP using this video to distract from their latest spill or something?
Don’t fret, because there’s more meat to this strange, holy-water-induced fever dream. As Chance the Rapper’s verse begins, he paces around a greenhouse full of dead plants, with Bieber sulking around behind him (perhaps another reference to the destruction of God’s boundless majesty?). The video then returns to the motel, where an overall-clad — and still super greasy — Bieber delivers the news to his partner that the plant is closing. His partner’s income from the nursing home is not enough to support the pair and they are evicted from their motel room — potentially a reference to the subpar treatment of healthcare workers in America? Interesting.
As Bieber’s oil worker caricature and his partner face homelessness, the problem at the heart of this portion of the video becomes obvious. Bieber’s essentially cosplaying poverty, egregiously misrepresenting and romanticizing its realities. It’s disheartening to see a global popstar with a huge platform, and exorbitant amounts of wealth, dress up in dirty clothes to play a homeless oil worker without actually providing any substantive commentary on poverty in America.
The pair continues to wander through town, down on their luck until a car pulls up beside them. And who is behind the wheel? Wilmer Valderrama, of all people, dressed in military fatigues. Valderrama shows them kindness and grace by inviting them home for “a warm meal.” Before you know it, they’re all headed to Valderrama’s house where it is revealed, through a tearful embrace with his family, that Valderrama’s army character has just returned from his deployment. That’s right, when Valderrama’s children first see their father after his service tour, he is accompanied by a (still greasy) Bieber and his (not Hailey) partner, both total strangers.
Charmingly, the family and the fictional Biebers enjoy the meal together. As they say grace and dine together, the final chorus rises and the video ends with a Hallmark-esque montage of the group laughing and eating, interspersed with flashbacks to Bieber’s oil drilling days. Heartwarming — like climate change for the soul.
Or at least it would be, if the video wasn’t so wildly random, utterly chaotic, and mildly offensive.
The song does kind of slap, though.

“This is my studio, and these are my instruments. It took me a while to understand that one of my purposes as an artist is to help aid people in the healing process. And so I’ve just been studying how sound can be a form of healing, and I’m incorporating these healing instruments into the music so that I can really put that intention into my music to heal.”
Jhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo, known as Jhené Aiko, spoke these words in April of 2019 on an episode of Elle.com’s “Waking up With,” before the release of her third studio album, “Chilombo,” in 2020. In the episode with Elle, Aiko plays a crystal singing bowl in the key of C, explaining that the sound helps balance the root chakra, and that one can only play it if they are of pure heart.
This is the first sound we hear at the beginning of Aiko’s Tiny Desk home concert, hosted by NPR, before the video reveals Aiko in a stunning blue gown, barefoot, surrounded by a variety of instruments. Drawing circles at the edges of the singing bowls, she prompts us to listen, drawing our auditory attention to the ethereal tone (like one would tell an audience to quiet down). She sings as if beginning a tale: one of a woman born from a Lotus, whose heart was broken but has now “found her focus,” lines from the introductory song to “Chilombo.”
Aiko then takes us on a trip down memory lane, singing “Stranger” and “Do Better Blues,” songs from her 2011 Sailing Soul(s) mixtape. She closes her eyes often, singing of the turmoils of love. Her body language reflects this, where, in “Do Better Blues,” she holds out three of her fingers, as if counting: “In a relationship I want three things: eyes that won’t die, lips that won’t lie, love that won’t die.”
Aiko performs other songs from her older discography as well, including 2014’s “To Love & Die” and 2011’s “W.A.Y.S.” As she returns to her latest album, she weaves together two songs, “Born Tired” and “Down Again,” singing, “I’m in the midst of an ascension now / Lifted and I’m driftin’ on a cloud / Never comin’ down again, down again / Never comin’ down again, never doubt again.” This marks a shift, one that symbolizes Aiko’s growth and understanding of herself.
It is worth taking note of the variety of percussion revealed to us. Creating a radiant atmosphere, the percussion adds twinkling touches and subtle undertones to Aiko’s alluring vocals. From a harp to the keys, to chimes and Aiko’s four singing bowls, the concert feels like a spiritual haven, one that is projected from our screens at home to our spaces. This transcendent effect is further heightened as Aiko serenades us with “Summer 2020,” reflecting, despite how “times are changing, [and] strangers [are] getting stranger,” she’ll “take some rain with [her] sunshine,” urging us to do the same and “Take it easy, simple like summertime.” She smiles wholeheartedly, as if embracing the format of her performance, calling her concert, “Quarantine Edition.”
Surprisingly, Aiko ends on yet another 2011 song, perhaps as an acknowledgement to her most faithful fans, performing “Eternal Sunshine.” Instead of going backwards in time, however, the end of the concert feels as if she has brought us along on her own spiritual and romantic journey. Aiko rocks and snaps with the beats, gesturing with her hands as if cultivating her aura while simultaneously inviting us to listen intimately, the way she would to a friend. From “Eternal Sunshine,” she sings: “Is it strange for me to say that if I were to die today / There's not a thing that I would change, I've lived well / Maybe I have made mistakes and been through my fair share of pain / But all in all, it's been okay, I've lived well,” as if thanking us for listening and reflecting on what she is grateful for. She sings of “all of the good things” and “only the good things,” and ends the concert with the singing bowls once more, having both fostered hope by reminding us to stay grounded and transported us into a land of magic and auditory freedom.

In an increasingly apocalyptic reality, “Monsterland” could not have secured a more timely premiere date. All eight episodes, each named for a U.S. city, premiered on Oct. 2, inviting viewers to submerge themselves in a dizzying collection of human atrocities.
In Hulu’s much-anticipated original series, the monsters aren’t just under the bed: They’re everywhere. Most critically, they are dormant in everyone, waiting patiently for the world’s madness to awaken them.
Starring Kelly Marie Tran (“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), Jonathan Tucker (“Kingdom”), and lesser known leads Trieu Tran and Marquis Rodriguez, the series begins with “Port Fourchon, Louisiana,” depicting the internal turmoil of a lonesome teenage waitress and mother. More palpable than the physical monster (a serial killer who can peel off and sew on faces of victims) is the adolescent’s anguish over whether to abandon her child, a deeply troubled toddler with violent tendencies.
Herein lies a central shortcoming of the series. While monsters and mythical creatures are fascinating grounds for a television show, the Hulu original struggles to maintain its authority following its unconvincing, unrealistic portrayal of demons. The first episode’s monster peels off its face in front of a cowering Kaitlyn Dever (“Booksmart”), only to reveal a head-scratching, almost corny depiction of raw skin over bones. Whereas the beast in “Eugene, Oregon” is more believable (a nefarious shadow assuming the form of a human silhouette), the episode’s plot fails to pass the feasibility test (the protagonist somehow assembles a light-beam machine gun from scratch and destroys the shadow). The viewer is left questioning what potential “Monsterland” could have mobilized if it chose to stay exclusively in the realm of humankind, illustrating the horror ordinary people are capable of.
This is not to say that “Monsterland” does not boast its fair share of remarkable moments. The suspenseful drudgery is occasionally pierced by scenes of heart-wrenching emotion. More memorable than the jump scares and mouth-covering gore are shared glimpses of compassion, a delicate yet dazzling tapestry of human connection. Whether it manifests in a friendless teen with a bedridden mother or an affluent New Yorker reconciling the aftermath of capitalistic success, solitude infests the psyche of each and every one of the show’s subjects. To witness how this solitude drives people to madness while simultaneously allowing for poignant interactions with strangers is a televisual privilege.
Another one of the show’s assets is its portrayal of diverse American experiences. “Monsterland” does a commendable job curating eight interpretations of American life — from a sickly Asian fisherman in Palacios, Texas to a socialite haunted by her past in New Orleans, Louisiana — that portray the country as it is: an amalgamation of astonishingly diverse experiences rendered familiar by an underlying humanity.
“Monsterland” refuses to glorify its protagonists. Rather, it challenges the viewer to reconcile with the fierce vulnerability of ordinary folk, to witness the horrors committed by good people driven to desperation. Sure, the tension leading up to the mother’s confrontation with the killer in “Port Fourchon, Louisiana” is memorable, but far more memorable is the adolescent’s ultimate decision to abandon her child in the backseat of an expensive car, suggesting the beginnings of a better childhood in the arms of more affluent parents. More compelling than the Halloween creepies are the moral ambiguities of incredibly complex and conflicted people.
The Hulu original series is eager to portray outlandish monsters when the most compelling monsters are the human subjects themselves. It is interesting to imagine an alternative series that would focus on human atrocities — rid of supernatural events — where the heart of the plot lay not in unexplainable magic but in the hair-raising possibility that the monster could be a neighbor, beloved, or oneself.

The explosive popularity of Netflix’s quarantine docu-series — for example, “Tiger King” or “Jeffrey Epstien: Filthy Rich” — has spurred a mass influx of similar single-season productions. Netflix’s new show, “Song Exploder,” is no exception. Based on Hrishikesh Hirway’s podcast, “Song Exploder,” the series traces the origins of four songs ranging from R.E.M. 's “Losing My Religion” to Ty Dolla $ign’s “LA.” While there isn’t anything inherently bad about this show, there isn’t much that’s good. Hirway’s podcast stood firmly on its own, and its translation into a visual medium is entirely unnecessary.
Each episode is centered around interviews that Hirway conducts with each of his guests. The show is edited to provide a concise but detailed narrative of each musician’s artistic process, and while it is interesting to see the artists speak about their works themselves and play their instruments, there’s really no need for it. The entertainment value only marginally increases with this visual aspect. To keep the attention of the viewers, there are some graphics inserted throughout the episodes, but the fact that this attention-grabbing is necessary is telling.
The interview builds the storyline through the exploration of each layer of the episode’s song, culminating in a performance of the full song, accompanied by an original music video. The video has potential as the only opportunity for it to embrace the visual medium, but even then, it falls short. The music video for Ty Dolla $ign’s song “LA” is mainly B-roll footage with the lyrics superimposed on the shots. While this allows the song’s lyrics to take center stage, there aren’t many visual elements that inspire interest in the video itself. In the episode for Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Wait for It,” the music video feels like something out of a TED Talk or an episode of Vox’s “Explained.” The powerful song demands visuals stronger than simple line graphics. The videos seem to undercut the music rather than enhance it.
Visual aspects removed, the interviews and exploration of the songs are great. The interviews that Hirway conducts are consistent, and they cover the same issues while allowing the artists space for their own narratives and commentary. Hirway organizes the questions so that each individual element of the song is dissected and explored in a chronological fashion, and the ends of the episodes — where everything finally comes together — are very satisfying.
Everything about this show makes sense in podcast form. The visual content, however, adds nothing to the story of how each song was made. The first episode is the only episode that had real footage of the production of Alicia Keys’ single “Three Hour Drive,” which justified the visual translation. Beyond that, all of the content of the show lies within the audio tracks of the interviews.
To its credit, the show seems to be aware of this shortcoming, and it attempts to match the tonal quality of the music with the tonality of the video composition. The first episode pairs Alicia Keys a laid-back ambiance with soft blue lighting and shots of water and rain. The last episode cuts to B-roll of Ty Dolla $ign smoking a cigarette, matching the free-flowing nature of his lyrics and music. While these shots are visually appealing, they feel like filler.
The tonality of the music can be understood by listening to the music. The musicians will often describe the feelings that they felt while hearing the individual elements of their songs and how they chose to incorporate them into the music. In the first episode, Sampha, a singer-songwriter collaborator on Alicia Keys’ song, says the opening has “a bit of sweetness to it, and sort of, like, a longing.” This quote alone describes the tone of the music and negates any necessity for a visual translation of it other than for aesthetic purposes.
Overall, “Song Exploder” is still entertaining and easy to watch, something to have playing in the background of a meal or another activity. You could follow along without having to fully invest yourself. Did it need to be made? Probably not. Could you get the same experience by listening to the original podcast? Probably so.

“Think about me doing Hip Hop.”
“... Doing what to it?”
In the new Netflix film “The 40-Year-Old Version,” Radha (Radha Blank), a struggling playwright, asks if her agent and best friend Archie (Peter Kim) can envision her as a rapper. His quippy, incredulous reply reflects how most characters in the film react to Radha's sudden embrace of hip hop: Does a washed up playwright approaching 40 have any business dabbling in rap? Ultimately, the film answers this question with a resounding “yes.” “The 40-Year-Old Version” is witty and stirring, illuminating the ways we can subvert the power structures that limit artistic expression.
Radha Blank wrote, directed, produced, and starred in “The 40-Year-Old Version,” lending her name and some of her own life experiences to the protagonist. She presents the vibrant Radha as a truly dynamic character with a layered and realistic depiction of her coexistent conviction and trepidation. Her quick humor easily rouses laughs and also exposes her character’s depth. “I just want to be an artist...Mommy, please tell me what to do,” she cries as she eats ribs alone in a corner of her apartment, in a scene that strikes a chord with anyone whose creative endeavors have ever fallen short. Her struggle to find her way as an artist is further exacerbated by the fact that she’s still reeling from recently losing her mother.
Radha was once the winner of a 30 under 30 playwright’s award, but now teaches playwriting to students in Harlem because she wants to avoid writing the “poverty porn” plays that wealthy white producers love to back. This idea of poverty porn — exploiting Black struggles or perpetuating disparaging stereotypes of Black people — becomes the inspiration for the first song of her new mixtape. Adopting the moniker RadhaMUSPrime, she raps, “Yo, it’s poverty porn, you regular Blacks are just such a yawn / If I want to get on, better write me some poverty porn.” She records this with the help of D (Oswin Benjamin), a 26-year-old producer she found on Instagram. D is also her eventual love interest, and though a laidback man of few words, he is an endearing complement to Radha as he pushes her to continue with her rap career. The defiant and thought provoking “Poverty Porn” impresses him, and he sees her potential as a musician even when she doubts herself.
Although it’s set contemporaneously, “The 40-Year-Old Version” was shot on film in black and white. This stylistic element lends the movie a romantic mystique that contrasts the harsh reality it presents to viewers: “Making it” as an artist is not solely determined by talent and ambition, but by longstanding systems of inequality. When Radha takes the opportunity to have her play “Harlem Ave” produced by J. Whitman (Reed Birney), a man who exemplifies her definition of poverty porn as “the white gaze’s eroticism of Black pain,” she finds that commercial success comes at the expense of her work’s integrity.
Radha is forced to write a white character into her play about a Black couple, and a white woman is hired to direct it. (“All the working Black directors are working!” Archie says). “Harlem Ave,” a story about gentrification, continues to slip away from Radha until she’s no longer proud of what it represents. This storyline is written with a keen awareness that underscores the consequences of co-opting art and tailoring it for the white gaze. Racial representation in the media is at the forefront of cultural conversations right now, but is the artistic autonomy of Black creators a part of this discourse? Black writers may have their plays, movies, or shows produced, but how often are they coerced into “selling out” in order to get their big break?
“The 40-Year-Old Version” is able to raise these pressing questions while still maintaining its effervescent tone and emotional relatability within its characters and relationships. Archie and Radha’s relationship is one of the highlights of the film; friends since high school, they have an easy, lovable rapport. When they argue, it’s felt deeply because their friendship is depicted so authentically. Even Radha’s interactions with her neighbors have a similar sense of realism, each eccentric character a reflection of Harlem’s diverse culture.
In her directorial debut, Radha Blank made a wonderfully imaginative and powerful film, examining the intersection between artistry and Black womanhood with a careful eye. There are a myriad of things to take away from “The 40 Year Old Version,” but perhaps what resonates most lies in one of Radha’s songs, when she raps: “Fund your own vision, fill your own void, find your own voice.”

What does it mean to be an ordinary person?
It is a simple inquiry with a complex answer, certainly not a question Detective Park (Song Kang-ho) would have entertained at the onset of “Memories of Murder,” Bong Joon-ho’s breakout film.
Though the auteur’s productions have recently cast a familiar Hollywood face (Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton in “Snowpiercer,” Jake Gyllenhaal and Lily Collins in “Okja”), Bong’s first few films were mostly domestic, and “Memories of Murder” stars an all-Korean cast. The leading actor, Song Kang-ho, continued his partnership with Bong in later projects such as “The Host,” “Snowpiercer,” and “Parasite.” The two remain heartwarmingly close to this day, evidenced by Bong’s inviting Song to the stage in his Palme d’Or acceptance speech.
Following its sensational Oscars victory, “Parasite” did more than simply increase its own public interest; it motivated cinephiles from across the globe to reappraise Bong Joon-ho’s previous films, including “Mother,” “Okja,” “Barking Dogs Never Bite,” and “Memories of Murder,” the latter of which will be rereleased in cinemas in October (or on Oct. 19 and 20) nationwide.
The film’s first scene reveals a young boy crouched in an open field, gazing intently at a grasshopper on a stalk of wheat. The boy catches it between his fingers and slowly rises. The frame is drowned in sunlight, and a mournful melody begins to play.
Why plant this seed of sadness so early? In a film focusing on the grisly murders of numerous female residents of the Gyeonggi Province, why does Bong introduce such intense nostalgia even before the first word is uttered on-screen?
In “Memories of Murder,” the camera is intentional in capturing the country’s distinct cultural fabric. In doing so, Bong successfully recreates a disruptive moment in Korean history — the unsuccessful chase for the nation’s first documented serial killer. Though the alleged culprit was identified in 2019, the decades-long search following the tragedies brought about nationwide pain and paranoia.
This long shadow of violence looms over “Memories of Murder.” Each scene evokes whispers of a psychological darkness, a mental obscurity that persists, even prospers, throughout the movie’s lifetime. The aftermath of violence is carefully chronicled by the camera lens.
“Memories of Murder” concludes in the same field that it began. An intensely disillusioned Detective Park, grown more mentally than physically exhausted by the throes of the killings, sits by the ditch where the first victim’s corpse was found. A schoolgirl approaches, explaining how she previously saw another man sitting exactly where Park was sitting. The detective quickly realizes that it was the killer.
Park’s eyes dart back and forth; it is impossible to discern whether he has encountered epiphany or is further receding into confusion. He turns towards the camera, his tearing eyes glazed in both craze and clarity.
As the cast credits scroll, mourning voices swell against an equally sorrowful instrumental track:
What happens when ordinary people face unordinary phenomena?
More frequently than not, Bong argues, ordinary people are guilty of perpetuating cycles of exceptional violence. This violence is not uniquely limited towards the serial killings. In the wake of the chase, police officers terrorize citizens with their own kind of brutality, exhibited through cruel interrogation mechanisms and a general apathy towards people, both innocent and suspected.
Park’s growth exhibits the moral ambiguity of harming others, especially when it is impossible to discern whether somebody is truly guilty. Near the conclusion of the film, the detective chooses not to shoot a key suspect, tiredly asking him whether he, too, is an ordinary person who does ordinary things. The detective’s attitude is not one of hatred, but exhaustion colored by wisdom, even if that wisdom begs more questions than answers:
What does it mean to be an ordinary person?

This past Tuesday marked the premiere of the 16th season of “The Bachelorette,” a show known for absurd displays of masculinity and unrealistic ideas of true love. Given that this season was filmed and released in the middle of a pandemic, it’s guaranteed to be "unprecedented." But even in any other year, this would be an unusual season.
It’s a season of many firsts. Clare Crawley, at 39 years old, is the oldest Bachelorette in history. Jeremy Higgins, at 40, is the oldest ever contestant. And those that have been following recent news surrounding this franchise would know it’s also the first time a Bachelorette has ever left the show mid-season.
But that’s not much of a spoiler. The entire “Bachelor Nation” has known about this shocking turn for months, and Clare Crawley’s impending replacement is all but explicit in the premiere. In the early days of reality television, the twists and turns and eventual winners of shows were easy to keep under wraps; information didn’t spread on the internet like wildfire. But with each contestant’s Instagram, Twitter, and even Reddit accounts, secrets never last long — which is why the presentation of Crawley’s departure in the season premiere was so disappointing.
The episode starts with a hyper-dramatized trailer of the season ahead, including sound-bites like “I expected way more from the oldest Bachelorette” from one of the contestants” and “You’ve just blown up ‘The Bachelorette’” from host Chris Harrison. The team behind “The Bachelorette” knows that their viewers are aware of Clare’s replacement, but they couldn’t stop themselves from finding the most exciting clips and cutting them together — grasping for a bombshell that no longer exists.
Following the intro, the episode snaps back to the typical “meet the Bachelorette” clips — only this time with a COVID-19 twist. Despite all of the health and safety theater, some of the content of the pandemic intro borders on dangerous misinformation. The contestants are shown receiving their COVID-19 tests, but all of them portrayed the experience as uncomfortable or even painful — probably not something a show should be telling millions of potentially test-skeptical viewers. And when the contestants receive their negative tests, they run around asking if they can get a hug, as if a negative test is the same as immunity.
Once the usual Bachelorette fare begins, the men approach Clare in a variety of attention-grabbing outfits: straight jackets, suits of armour, and a James Bond costume, to name a few. When Clare meets contestant Dale Moss, a former NFL wide-receiver, she says “I definitely feel like I’ve just met my husband,” quite a powerful example of real-life foreshadowing.
Once all the contestants have arrived, Clare talks with most of them one-on-one, sharing a few intimate moments and breaking up a few arguments. The first-impression rose (a prize which automatically qualifies the winner for the next round and indicates the initial front-runner) goes to Dale, naturally, and during the rose ceremony, eight men get the boot.
Unfortunately, the drama is completely lost on the audience. What would have been a real show-stopper of a series twist was leaked months ago, and now audiences are just itching to see Tayshia Adams take over as the Bachelorette.
It’s often hard to understand why people want to be on reality shows. Is the fifteen minutes of fame truly worth the potential national embarrassment? Bachelorette contestants always talk about how noble their intentions are; after all, admitting to being on the show just to gain a few thousand Instagram followers is the fastest way to get the chop. Some of the contestants on “The Bachelorette” may be genuine hopeless romantics, but in recent years, the draw of social media fame is impossible to ignore. Former Bachelorette contestants gain thousands of followers and a few sponsorship deals for their trouble. In addition, there is something to be said for wanting to earn a spot on a show with an unspoken minimum attractiveness threshold, thus showing yourself off as a catch. And for the Bachelorette herself, dating over thirty men at a time that are all fawning over you might sound like a blast.
Everything about “The Bachelorette” is driven by social media. Fans follow the contestants, all of whom have “Bachelorette season 26348” in their bios, which only makes more people want to be on the show, and further engages the audience outside the episodes. But, unfortunately, social media is also responsible for ruining this season entirely. All the dramatics surrounding it have been spoiled beyond repair, and when you remove unexpected drama from a reality show, you don’t have much left.

Recently revived at the 2020 New York Film Festival, “Xiao Wu,” also known as “The Pickpocket,” is Jia Zhangke’s 1997 directorial debut. The film, which follows the life of an apathetic criminal, finds a surprising profundity in spite of, and perhaps because of, its nihilistic tone. Jia uses unique technical elements — cacophonous sound mixing and unusual shot framing — to build a conceptually rich film that meditates on personal stagnancy in a rapidly changing world.
The film was shot in 1997 in the city of Fenyang, with opening scenes referencing the handover of Hong Kong. This tumultuous political backdrop sets up tension with the titular character, Xiao Wu (Wang Hongwei). When the city’s police department decides to crack down on crime, he, a well-known pickpocket, is instantly under suspicion. Simultaneously, Xiao Wu’s former friend, a reformed thief, refuses to invite Xiao Wu to his wedding, having moved on from his former life as a criminal. But Xiao Wu is apathetic in the face of these political and social troubles — he neither changes nor rebels. Instead, he wanders to a brothel where he finds himself falling in love with a prostitute, Mei Mei, (Hao Hongjian). The plot of the film is propelled by Xiao Wu’s listlessness and passivity. The storyline unfurls slowly and consistently as he meanders from one moment to the next; as he is shuttered from one space, he finds a next, and a next.
Shot in 16mm, the cinematography by Nelson Lik-wai Yu is stunning, providing vibrant imagery that enriches the movie’s emotional gravity. The film moves fluidly between the distinct visual environments Yu creates. Banal city life is greys and pale blues, punctuated by the constant, disorienting movement of bikes and cars. Xiao Wu’s childhood home is highly contrasted: Bright whites stand out against deep shadows, and barely any motion is perceptible on screen. The brothel, where Xiao Wu falls in love, is deep red and electric cyan, shot in long takes with the camera slowly spinning. But despite these vastly different aesthetic worlds, Jia keeps the film tonally consistent — impersonal, even neutral. The relationship between the characters and the camera is restrained. Close-ups are rarely used; thus, the emotional richness of the film comes from the environment around the characters rather than the characters themselves. What provokes empathy and emotion from the viewer is nearly entirely in the cinematography: color, camera movement, and shot framing.
But at times, the editing by Yu Xiao Ling detracts from the beauty of the film, as the editing calls attention to itself. Certain scenes jump from one vantage point to another, missing visual markers that would normally signify continuity. This disrupts the cohesion of certain scenes, taking viewers out of the world of the film. Other scenes make distracting use of cut ins and cutaways. Because the cinematography is one of the film’s strongest tools for building emotional weight, this style of editing feels off-putting and out of place.
“Xiao Wu” best captures a sense of loneliness and isolation when it focuses on the world around Xiao Wu, rather than the character himself. At times, the camera pans in slow, dizzying loops, shifting away from Xiao Wu to his surroundings, shots that make Xiao Wu seem small in comparison to the scale of the cityscapes around him. At other points, the camera does the opposite, remaining completely still. Characters shift in and out of frame as the scene plays out, the camera imposing a boundary that Xiao Wu interacts with. Certain scenes play out without him even appearing on screen. In the latter part of the film, Xiao Wu visits his hometown and an entire conversation takes place with him offscreen before the camera cuts to a shot of him sitting to the side, silent.
The sound mixing likewise emphasizes environment over character. The film barely uses a score, instead preferring a cacophony of ambient noise mixed by Yang Zhang. Background noise — the sound of a TV, wheels on a dirt road, a toddler’s cries — eclipses the characters, drowning out the already-sparse dialogue. The sounds are often amplified to feel simultaneously quotidian and surreal such as the amplified, intimate sound of an egg being peeled, or the sound of a TV show with heavy reverb. The technical elements of the film — the cinematography and the sound mixing — allow the viewer to examine Xiao Wu’s relationship to the world around him as he alternates between ignorance of it and submission to it. These surprising technical choices never drown out the individual characters, Jia uses them to create a strangely humanizing and tender effect.
At multiple points in the film, Xiao Wu stands in the background of a busy street, rendered nearly invisible behind the cacophony of sound and movement. Yet as much as he blends in, he stands out — because of his stillness. These kinds of contradictions carry the film — visibility and invisibility, aimlessness and purpose, apathy and feeling. Unlike the many meditations on loneliness that have preceded and followed it, “Xiao Wu” is not solely a meditation on Xiao Wu’s estrangement from the world. The vibrant, incarnate setting of the film, juxtaposed with the character himself, tells the story not just of a man who is alien, but also of the society that has chosen to alienate him.

“The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue,” a book about a girl cursed to be forgotten, is a stunningly memorable work filled with love, loss, and wonder. The novel follows protagonist Addie LaRue, a young woman who, in order to escape her marriage in early eighteenth-century France, makes a Faustian bargain with a mysterious god. Addie is given immortality, but in return, everyone she ever meets is bound to forget her. Indeed, she lives through three centuries before hearing the fateful words “I remember you.” A tale about what it means to be remembered, this book delivers a powerful message about resilience and impact wrapped in captivating prose.
This is a novel made extraordinary by its characters. There are three central and beautifully intertwined characters: Addie, Luc (the god who cursed her), and Henry (the first person to remember Addie in 300 years). Addie is lovable for her strength and resistance through the confines of her curse. Though the option to end her curse by giving her soul to Luc is offered time and time again, Addie perseveres, and finds new ways to make a mark upon her world despite the limitations of her situation. Henry is equally as admirable. His internal conflict is presented beautifully and explores the intricacies of self-worth as influenced by the opinions of others. Lastly, Luc is a powerful and intriguing antagonist, who is written in such a way that he is empathetic one minute and insufferable the next. Out of these main three characters, two of the characters are explicitly LGBTQ+. This detail is handled in a positive and casual way; their queerness is not integral to the story, finally giving audiences a fantasy book where LGBTQ+ characters can just be as they are. In addition to this book's triumvirate, there are some prominent side characters that could have been a little better developed and dynamic, but the primary trio is so enticing that this shortcoming can be mostly forgiven.
The characters’ complex relationships and nuances are revealed through a nonlinear timeline, which juxtaposes the central plot with flashbacks of the early days of Addie’s immortality. Additionally, though the book focuses on Addie’s perspective and showing the growth of her character, some flashbacks that explore Henry’s backstory add to the roundness of his characterization. Jumping between time periods never feels confusing. With each section, Schwab perfects the balance between giving enough answers to satisfy and creating enough new questions to keep readers guessing — so much so that the pacing and arrangement of the story make the book impossible to put down.
Both the story’s rhythm and its imagery and word choice give it the enchanting cadence of a fairy tale. While this book is much more character-driven than plot-driven, this distinction works in favor of Schwab’s imaginative storytelling style. Though the fantastical elements of this novel make it whimsical and wonderful, the story stays grounded in its well-explored and relatable themes. As Addie experiments with how to make a mark on the world through art and music despite the limitations of her curse, the reader gets a subtle lesson in making the most of the time one is given. Especially in the face of the events of this past year, a book about finding the will to keep on living through moments of pain in order to find moments of triumph is a necessary read.
The most prominent message this book provides is best summed up by the titular character herself. As Addie realizes that the way for her to make an impact is through inspiring artists, she says, “ideas are wilder than memories.” If one could forget the captivating details of Addie’s story, the ideals it provides about art, existence, and memory are everlasting.

Named the “most adventurous downtown playwright of her generation” by the New York Times, Young Jean Lee offered a session of her tried-and-true playwriting workshop in partnership with Harvard’s Theater, Dance, & Media department on Friday, Oct. 9. Lee led a group of about twenty student writers through a series of generative prompts aimed at giving each attendee a new, developed idea for a play.
Lee, a playwright, director, and filmmaker, is often commended for her experimentality, humor, and use of the avant-garde. Lee was the first Asian-American woman to have a play produced on Broadway when her piece “Straight White Men,” was performed at the Hayes Theater in 2018. Lee is currently an Associate Professor of Theater and Performance at Stanford University, where her playwriting workshop has been in development for the past three years. At Stanford, her workshop method has produced a plethora of work, with Lee referring to it as a “factory” that cultivates new works for production at the university.
Structured in three distinct parts, Lee’s workshop prioritized accountability, messiness, and defeating the perfectionist in the writer's mind. The first set of prompts were designed to help attendees produce a span of ideas for a play and the second set to spur attendees into writing the actual play. The final segment included a Q&A session in which Lee checked in with each and every participant. The rules, as set by Lee, included writing as fast as the attendees were able and not deleting anything. (Thinking too much would bog down writers and allow them to give in to their inner perfectionists.) Though participants did not share their ideas and what they were working on with the group, after each section there was time set aside for troubleshooting and reflection with Lee.
“I would encourage you not to reread or edit anything that you write for the same reasons. Because the key is just to generate pages. And the reason why generating pages is so useful is because you are learning about your play as we generate those pages,” Lee, in urging students to just write and get their ideas out there, said. “So the purpose of generating the pages is not to create something beautiful. It's to figure out who your characters are, what you're interested in, what you're not interested in and what your style is.”
“Much of my life I feel like I operate on this concept of diminishing marginal returns, where it’s like, you just take the first step and then every additional step is less and less monumental for the ultimate product,” said attendee Eric J. Cheng ’20, a fan of the workshop’s “just do it” attitude. “And so I really think that in [these] three hours, I probably achieved maybe what I would have in 2 months of being like: Oh I have this play idea; oh, I’m not gonna write it; oh, I’m gonna write it when I really have it fleshed out.”
Alice J. Findlay ’22, who tuned into the workshop from the United Kingdom, noted that despite the time difference, she was surprised at just how much she was able to create. “I think the exercise that was just: Write something as badly as you can. [Giving myself] permission to write badly really helped me just continue pushing through even though I knew what I was writing was rubbish. But it was really nice to actually have something to start with and have somewhere to go from there and not just be staring at a blank screen.”
“I was honestly really struck by just how accessible everything that she was teaching us was,” said attendee Natalie J. Choo ’22, a self-proclaimed playwriting beginner. “But I felt like the whole time what she was saying, and the prompts that she gave us — the exercises that she took us through, were very accessible for someone who didn’t really have a lot of playwriting experience and also just very applicable to other areas of creating art and just going through life in general.”
Lee’s workshop was one event in a series of workshops and artist talks that the Theater, Dance, & Media is offering for students and affiliates this fall.

As every discerning film buff knows, movies can (and should!) be reviewed based exclusively on their trailers. “Ammonite,” director Francis Lee’s second film, now faces that very same fate. Originally meant to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, “Ammonite” –– or at least its trailer –– bears a great deal of resemblance to another film which debuted at Cannes one year earlier: the critically-acclaimed, intellectually challenging, cinematographically stunning French romance “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (this claim is only based on a small dollop of authorial bias).
A certain amount of factual similarity between the two period lesbian romances is undeniable. As a matter of fact, one minute into the “Ammonite” trailer, and any person lucky enough to have watched “Portrait” and still have a working brain may wonder if they haven’t seen something like this before.
For your viewing pleasure, The Harvard Crimson has assembled the following three checklists: the first being elements of the “Ammonite” trailer that seem oddly familiar, the second being a few things that seem exclusive to “Ammonite,” and the third counting those which are (so far) exclusive to “Portrait.” Feel free to watch the “Ammonite” trailer with the lists in hand and check off the boxes as you go along.
Things in the “Ammonite” Trailer That You’ve Seen Before:
An unnecessary amount of hindering garments (that will be peeled off to great effect later in the film)
Dark-Haired Main Character meets Blonde Future Lover and they fail to hit it off right away
Blonde Future Lover is tied, generally against her will, to a husband
The only man in the film makes an appearance
Shot of Dark-Haired Main Character looking at her work in a museum
Shot of Dark-Haired Main Character at work in her studio
Character plays one single key of a piano and/or harpsichord
Dark-Haired Main Character and Blonde Future Lover go walking on a rocky beach
Blonde Future Lover shot from behind (bonus points if her face is obscured by a head garment)
Climactic violin crescendo
Women sit side-by-side on the beach, discussing the ocean
Older maternal character notices their budding relationship
Deeply intimate close shot of hands touching
Dramatic shot of ocean crashing around big rock
Tearful embrace
Longing stare #1, 2, 3, et al
Things in the “Ammonite” Trailer That You Didn’t See in “Portrait of a Lady on Fire”:
A slightly discomfiting age gap
A male director
Saoirse Ronan and Kate Winslet (overall a positive)
Real historical characters Mary Anning (Winslet) and Charlotte Murchison (Ronan)
Paleontology!
The United Kingdom
Things in “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” That Have Not Yet Appeared in “Ammonite”:
A sky that is any colour but grey
The epic context of a love story spanning several years between the writer-director Céline Sciamma and the lead actress Adèle Haenel
France
Fall foliage
A radical take on the female gaze
Adèle Haenel and Noémie Merlant (again, a positive)
Subtitles
Discourse on the flawed concept of the muse
A spirited discussion of the Orpheus & Eurydice myth
Digs at Sciamma and Haenel aside, Winslet and Ronan’s shared star power, combined with Francis Lee’s directorial potential, marks “Ammonite” as a film to watch out for. On Nov. 13 it will appear in theatres in the United States. And though a few questions remain –– is “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” one of the best romances ever made? Will “Ammonite” be able to distinguish itself from “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” one of the best romances ever made? –– only one thing is certain. This intrepid journalist will be first in line at the premiere.

In 10 years, Christopher Nolan's “Inception” has established itself as the beginning of an era of film, from bombastic horn-filled scores to fantastical practical effects. “Inception” explores the malleability of time, the untethering of reality, and the depravity of humanity — all while bridging the gap between mainstream blockbusters and art-house culture.
“Inception”’s premise is that dreams can be constructed, manipulated, and shared, a concept which attracts professional “extractors” who work to exploit these dreams to steal ideas from, or plant them into, a subject’s head. Extractor Dominic “Dom” Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) assembles an elite team of six to infiltrate Robert Fischer’s (Cillian Murphy) mind out of a promise from a wealthy client to clear Dom’s criminal record and reunite him with his children. Dom’s team stars a talented ensemble of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe). Dom’s crew designs and populates an incredible three-layered dreamscape into Fischer's subconscious. With each level in this intricately designed heist, though, Nolan peels back a new layer of Dom’s character, slowly revealing his deeply repressed guilt.
The concept of time is essential to understanding “Inception.” Throughout the film, Dom and his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard) symbolically serve as figures of the past and future. Unable to change, Dom drowns in his guilt of the past. Dom desires to reunite with his children — to return to a time before Mal's suicide — so deeply that he endangers those closest to him. Dom finds it even harder to let go of Mal herself. In Paris, the projections of his own subconscious seize him and prevent him from retaliating against Mal. And at a critical juncture of the snowy fortress hospital scene, Dom prioritizes Mal's projection's life over completing the mission.
On the other hand, Mal lives in the future. Before her death, when she and Dom lived in limbo, trapped in a purgatory-like dream world, Mal only wanted to grow old with Dom. She literally locked away any vestiges tying her to the real world; for Mal, limbo had become reality. Her present children were no longer real, and her past lover was no longer real, either. Having lost all awareness of the present and the past, Mal embodies death itself. As the future always leads to death, Mal seeks her own demise and tries to drag Dom along with her.
Symbolically, Dom's projection of Mal is also his rejected future; he pushes all his future wants and goals into the subconscious figure that is Mal. Neither half of him, alone, can live happily. As the film nears an end, however, Dom embraces Mal along with the forward-looking hope that she represented. He finally recognizes his real life with his children. Prior to this climactic coalescence, Dom treated and viewed every trouble with a tinge of irrelevance, since he saw nothing more important than his past. When he awakens on the plane of his new reality, though, his eyes bulge wide, receiving light and beauty that had been buried deep in his jaded soul. No longer does he rely on his memory of Mal to keep himself afloat. He doesn’t need to check the top at the end, either. Because regardless of which dimension — dream or not — Dom ends up in, he keeps his eyes trained, open, on the passing of his current life.
In a film about time, Nolan incorporates themes of time — dreams and memories —into the structure of “Inception” itself. On an initial watch, it's simply impossible to understand the full complexity of “Inception.” Yet when scenes repeat themselves from beginning to end, the mystique is gone. And the specific moments are chopped-up and rearranged, like memory itself. It is only with astute attention that Nolan’s thesis becomes clear: Be present, or the gift of life will be lost.
Imagine yourself in pandemic limbo: Do you look forward, or backward? It's easy to become Dom and let sentimentality overcome you and hang onto yesterday. It's also easy to live like Mal, waiting for the issues of today to pass. Yet it's the balance between these two extremes that we must seek. Listen to Saito, who aged decades in limbo:
“Do you want to take a leap of faith or become an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone?”

Hollywood has been on a downward spiral since the start of the quarantine, and the recent delay of “No Time to Die” until April 2, 2021 is almost certainly the nail in the coffin. Crumbling on the inside because you won’t be able to see Daniel Craig’s franchise finale for another year and a half? Here’s a list of Craig’s Bond films, ranked worst to best. Happy re-watching!
“Quantum of Solace,” dir. Marc Foster (2008)
No doubt Foster’s spin on the Bond franchise was a noble endeavor. “Quantum of Solace” finds itself at the bottom of the list more because of its lack of memorability than its faulty execution. Bond is freshly wounded from the death and betrayal of his beloved, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) in “Casino Royale.” While Craig deftly portrays an egoistic man reconciling with the loss of a woman he believed to be "the one," the film passes over critical opportunities to heighten Bond’s emotional complexity.
The dusty, burnt desert aesthetic of the production contrasts delightfully with a plot featuring villain Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a member of the Quantum organization seeking to control Bolivia’s water supply. Though Greene’s demise is clever (he is forced to meander in the desert and presumably perishes of dehydration), the absence of the signature out-with-a-bang annihilation of the villain is largely unsatisfying.
Olga Kurylenko plays Camille Montes, a resolute but ultimately forgettable Bond girl who hungers for revenge after her family is murdered. The lack of chemistry between Bond and Montes could have been exacerbated by the previous film, where the viewer revels in a rollicking romance between Bond and the compelling, seductive Lynd. A round of applause to Kurylenko, though. No actress should have to follow a performance by Eva Green.
“Spectre,” dir. Sam Mendes (2015) 
Oh, boy. It was certainly a wrestling match between “Spectre” and “Quantum of Solace” for the bottom of the list. “Spectre” disappoints because of its exceptionally star-studded cast, including Academy Award winner Christopher Waltz (“Inglourious Basterds,” “Django Unchained”) and the legendary Monica Belluci (“Malèna”). To top it off, acclaimed director Sam Mendes ("1917," "American Beauty") returns to the directing chair, but this time to surprisingly lukewarm results.
Still, "Spectre" showcases one of the franchise’s most astounding opening credits, featuring Sam Smith’s sublimely haunting “Writing’s On The Wall.” Mendes also films the opener in a stunning one-take as a costumed Bond walks through Mexico City’s vibrant Day of the Dead festivities, then engages in a breathtaking helicopter fight scene. But despite these masterful elements, “Spectre” still winds up as a head-scratching amalgamation of unevenly plotted events.
French actress Léa Seydoux is also in the mix with a lukewarm performance as Bond girl Dr. Madeleine Swann. It is clear the screenwriters made a noble effort to construct Swann as an empowered femme fatale. In an early meeting with Bond, Seydoux moodily intones “I hate guns,” then proceeds to nonchalantly disassemble a gun in front of a startled Bond. Yet in the film’s defining moments (for instance, a climactic fight scene with a hulking Mr. Hinx played by Dave Bautista) Swann simply presses herself against the train wall, open-mouthed and helpless. Perpetually perturbed, the blonde psychologist leaves the audience a little irritated and very unsatisfied. It will be interesting to see her growth (or lack thereof) in 2021’s “No Time to Die.”
“Casino Royale,” dir. Martin Campbell (2006) 
Craig’s first appearance as the seventh 007 is perhaps the most sensational. Frequently listed among the 21st century’s greatest blockbusters, Campbell’s “Casino Royale” redefines exceptional filmmaking as we know it. From its hair-raising opening action scene to its nail-biting poker play, “Casino Royale” is unapologetically fresh. Craig’s Bond challenges previous conventions, choosing brute force over stylized cunning.
A review of “Casino Royale” would be remiss without an appreciative standing ovation for Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). Audiences are presented with a rare femme fatale, a woman whose vulnerability does not diminish, but rather enhances, her compelling strength. The chemistry between Bond and Lynd is delightfully ignited by an ability to see eye-to-eye as both conspirators and lovers. The romance depicted in the 2006 film is a remarkably rare one for behemoth blockbusters, one that the franchise has failed to reproduce since.
Phenomenal supporting performances further illuminate the already brilliant film. Diabolical banker Le Chiffre is sublimely embodied by “Hannibal” actor Mads Mikkelsen. All subjectivity aside, the best part of Craig’s James Bond franchise is Jeffrey Wright’s appearances as FBI agent Felix Leiter. Despite his minimal screen time, Leiter’s familiar presence is a welcome one, and “Casino Royale” boasts some of the most memorable Bond-Leiter interactions.
“Casino Royale” leaves audiences dazed and enraptured by the rare euphoria of watching a damn good film.
“Skyfall,” dir. Sam Mendes (2012)
The Academy Award winning director outdid himself on this one. Mendes delivers an exquisitely action-packed, profound addition to 007. Whether it’s the alleged death of Bond or the crushing demise of M, “Skyfall” boasts a series of monumental plot developments. Most critically, the plot of “Skyfall” is courageous enough to introduce vulnerability to a franchise defined by shiny guns and rugged masculinity. Craig deftly steps out of his egoistic persona and assumes the air of a complicated man who must come to terms with his fallibility.
Solitude is conveyed through multidimensional, artful means. Unlike his other films, Daniel Craig is depicted standing alone in “Skyfall” posters, an intensely stoic expression etched onto his roughened features. Despite its hurricane of action, the film is a sobering homecoming, a rare opportunity to humanize Bond not as a weapon, but as a man. The agent’s fated return to Skyfall provides an unprecedented glimpse into Bond’s lonesome childhood, suggesting an upbringing defined by trauma and faux strength.
As the film progresses, the audience must reconcile with the moral ambiguities of all characters, not just that of magnificently maniacal villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). Judi Dench’s M is scrutinized as a fading leader who champions what contemporaries hound as “old-fashioned” tactics. What is the use of vintage cars and exploding pens in a world defined by dizzying technological innovation? Is it finally the era where 0s and 1s have become more powerful than 007s? “Skyfall” provides a deafening answer, one that is succinctly spoken through M’s recitation of Tennyson: “We are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are. One equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”
"No Time to Die" is scheduled to open in theaters on April 2, 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a crazy year for Houston-based rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
From her hit EP to a viral song on TikTok to collaborations with Beyoncé and Cardi B, Meg has had more success in 2020 than most up-and-coming rappers can dream of in their full length careers. With her great success has also come vitriol from those trying to take her down a notch.
In July 2020, Megan Thee Stallion came forward with news that she was shot in the foot, only to be met with the scepticism, rumors, and jokes that much too often follow a Black woman’s admission of pain. A month after the shooting, Meg addressed her naysayers on Instagram, posting a now-deleted image of her stitched-up foot with the caption: “Lol what I have learned abt majority of the people on social media is y’all like to hear bad news before good news, a lie spreads quicker than the truth, and y’all really be believing the shit YALL make up … I got hit at the back of my feet because when I got shot I was WALKING AWAY FACING THE BACK.”
The day after posting and deleting the image of her foot, Meg addressed her audience on her Instagram Live, claiming that rapper Tory Lanez, who was previously rumored to be the gunman, was in fact that one that shot her. After months of silence, Lanez finally responded to the allegations by releasing a new album that supposedly addresses Meg and the shooting.
In light of Lanez’s denial, his new album — which has the lowest first-week sales of his career — and the continued prevalence of Meg’s doubters, there is no better time to uplift the incomparable Megan Thee Stallion. To celebrate her incredibly successful year and brand new single “Don’t Stop (feat. Young Thug)” released Oct. 2, here is a list of Megan Thee Stallion’s top five songs.
5. “Freak Nasty”
A song written for “Hot Girls” everywhere, “Freak Nasty” confirms Meg’s identity as both an electrifying rapper and songwriter and an unapologetic freak. “Freak Nasty” is the type of woman-centered, sex-positive anthem that Meg is known for making. Lyrics such as “And I walk like a pimp ‘cause I am” and “I'm a hot girl, so I make these n***** sweat” show off Meg’s unwavering confidence, enviable power over men, and undeniable sex appeal. While “Freak Nasty” may not be Meg’s number one single, it definitely warrants a place in the top five.
4. “Last Week in HTx”
A lesser known Megan Thee Stallion track, “Last Week in HTx” comes from the rapper’s professional solo debut EP “Make It Hot,” released in 2017. Her most successful single at the time, “Last Week in HTx” has amassed over eight million views on YouTube. Throughout the single, Meg reminds listeners that she’s from Houston, Texas, something that has clearly influenced her music, style, and personality. While many today may not know “Last Week in HTx,” the song is representative of Meg’s earliest music and her upward trajectory as an artist.
3. “Savage”/ “Savage Remix (feat. Beyonce)” 
The third single from Meg’s 2020 EP “Suga,” “Savage” is number three on this list for its cultural impact. Soon after the track’s release, “Savage” rose to fame on TikTok after 19-year-old creator Keara “KeKe” Wilson choreographed “The Savage Challenge.” For weeks during quarantine, “The Savage Challenge” permeated every corner of the internet. Celebrities, social media influencers, your friends and family, and even Megan Thee Stallion herself were performing the dance for their social media followings. Less than two months after the release of “Savage,” Megan Thee Stallion and Beyonce collaborated on “Savage Remix,” one of the best things to come out of Houston besides the two artists themselves. Like the original version, “Savage Remix (feat. Beyonce)” became massively popular and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Meg’s first number-one single.
2. “Cash Shit (feat. DaBaby)”
Featured by Billboard, Complex, and Pitchfork on their respective lists of the top songs of 2019, “Cash Shit” is easily one of Meg’s best songs. From her mixtape “Fever,” “Cash Shit” features DaBaby, another rapper new to the mainstream at the time. Opening the track with “Bitch, I’m a star,” Meg spends the rest of the song proving how true this is. Even on his own verse, DaBaby is in awe of Meg (and rightfully so) rapping “I be cool on 'em, bitch, ain't no pressure (Uh-uh) / 'Til I met this lil' freak, her name Megan (Ooh) / This lil' thing here a stallion, look how she walk / Look how she talk, she sexy.”
1. “Big Ole Freak”
While “Big Ole Freak” does not have the virality of “Savage,” nor its Beyonce feature, real Hot Girls know that this is Meg’s best single. Despite peaking at only 65 on the Billboard Hot 100, “Big Ole Freak” was certified Platinum by the RIAA after selling over one million copies, making it Meg’s first Platinum single. With its catchy chorus, expert sampling of older songs, and Meg’s characteristic raunchy and tantalizing verses, “Big Ole Freak” epitomizes Meg’s undeniable talent, freak status, and overall stardom.

The undergraduate-run Harvard College Film Festival (HCFF) allows young filmmakers from around the world to submit films for evaluation, participate in a multi-day screening event, attend panels, and access a global network of artists.
Matthew Chang ’22, an Art, Film, and Visual Studies (AFVS) concentrator and co-president of the HCFF, spoke about the experience of transitioning to a digital platform for this year’s event.
Chang, who joined HCFF as a sophomore, recently assumed the mantle of co-president. Because of the pandemic, HCFF’s initial plans to hold its festival on-campus last year were thrown into confusion. He noted how he and co-president Derrick T. Ochiagha ’22, a Crimson Arts writer, had to adapt as a result of COVID-19.
“It’s been a good amount of work, trying to learn as we go,” Chang said.
Chang emphasized the difficulty of building engagement for digital film screenings. Citing recurrent film outings to Boston as an important ritual for HCFF members, he noted the loss of real-time, in-person connection as a critical challenge.
“It’s actually so much harder to get people to watch films as a group online or through Zoom,” Chang said. “I feel like the beauty of our club on campus was being able to watch shows together, like going to the AMC every week or every two weeks, watching a film, and talking about it.”
Chang shared that the HCFF board has been devising ways to translate the interactive excitement of in-person programming to digital spaces. One idea Chang mentioned was incentivizing participation with small prizes.
“We had an idea for a movie trivia with a prize like an Amazon gift card. Just something like that, where people can come in and actually feel like they can be involved,” he said.
In past years, HCFF has invited industry luminaries to speak at their events, with an emphasis on amplifying diverse voices and celebrating lesser-known filmmakers. Last year, for instance, “Crazy Rich Asians” screenwriter Adele Lim came to speak at the festival. Despite the myriad of challenges, Chang noted that speaker outreach has become easier following the transition.
“On campus, we would reach out to a lot of people and it would be hard to, one, get them to respond, but two, after that, they’d have to clear their schedule, they’d have to be free. And then we’d have to fly them out, get them a place to stay,” Chang said.
“But on Zoom, people can just join Zoom meetings, which is awesome. Talent can just join the Zoom meetings for 30 minutes and just talk to us, like, talk to people,” he continued. “And so in that sense, I think we’ll have a robust lineup for this year.”
Chang noted that the abrupt transition has compelled HCFF to develop innovative ways of engaging with film and facilitating spaces for discussion.
“A good thing about being online — just the whole thing changing — is that we really have to think about the best way to showcase our films and the best ways to get people to watch,” he said.
Toward the end of the conversation, Chang reflected on the broader role of HCFF in fostering a cinematic culture at Harvard.
“On Harvard’s campus, I feel like very little people directly pursue film, but so many people are interested in film,” Chang said.
He further explained that, despite the small number of concentrators in AFVS every year, many students want to engage with film but simply do not know where or how to begin.
“The fact that 10 people can be actually studying film, but hundreds of people want to be involved in HCFF, is just amazing,” Chang said. “I think HCFF brings so many people who are sort of interested in film, opens up film to them, and makes them question, you know, if they want to dig deeper into film, if they’re really passionate about it.”
When asked whether HCFF instills in Harvard students a love for film, Chang expressed his belief that HCFF serves to draw out the passion latent in individuals.
“I think that it was already in them,” he said. “But HCFF helped them discover that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Tragic Jungle,” Mexican filmmaker Ylene Olaizola (credited as writer, producer, editor, and director) revives the Mayan myth of Xtabay — a female demon in the Yucatán Peninsula who lured men deep into the rainforest before killing them. Olaizola’s film is supposed to be an otherworldly experience — a fever dream fraught with woozy visions of unexplained horrors and carnal desires. But “Tragic Jungle” is neither evocative nor frightening; in fact, it’s rather bland.
The year is 1920. Agnes (Indira Rubie Andrewin) flees from a wedding with a wealthy British landowner by escaping into the rainforest bordering Mexico and British Honduras. When her aggrieved ex-fiancé pursues her into the wilderness with a small cohort of armed men, she fakes her death, and eventually stumbles into a company of local gum tree workers. As her presence seems to attract increasingly mystical occurrences, the workers quickly descend into a flurry of helpless confusion.
While it explores an interesting premise, “Tragic Jungle” is debilitated by a scattershot narrative. For a film that’s supposed to be shrouded in myth, the visual allusions to the supernatural are rare and far from explicit. It’s never quite clear what direction Olaizola wants to take, and that leaves audiences confused over what they should expect from the film.
Olaizola withholds answers, perhaps in an effort to ratchet up mystery and tension, but “Tragic Jungle” is so insular that it becomes difficult for viewers to get involved. This confusion is evident with the film’s narrative inconsistencies. After getting shot, Agnes appears to limp in one scene, but not the next. At one point, we’re led to believe that she died from her wounds, but she soon awakens fully alert and unscathed. Sometimes, gum tree workers see her having sex with one of their compatriots, but when that individual is found dead in the same spot the next morning, none of them question the nature of the tragedy or her innocence. These inconsistencies are maddening because it’s never clear if these visions are real or imagined, and it’s impossible to get invested in a narrative when it’s never exactly clear what that narrative is supposed to be.
“Tragic Jungle” also rarely explains the myth it’s meant to portray. Most audiences are likely unfamiliar with the folklore behind Xtabay, and in a film where the only hints to the source material are forgettable, disconnected voiceovers, it’s difficult for viewers to understand what the film is about without Googling it.
Perhaps Olaizola didn’t focus on conveying a clear, linear narrative in “Tragic Jungle,” because she prioritized building a lurid environment steeped in mysticism. Agnes is mute after the opening scenes, and dialogue is a scarce commodity. The strange events that unfold largely go unexplained, and the film progresses cyclically, locked in a confused stupor.
This puts a brunt of the storytelling on the film’s visual language, and thankfully, the cinematography is captivating enough to pick up some of “Tragic Jungle”'s narrative slack. Director of Photography Sofía Oggioni explained in an interview that she rarely used fill lights when shooting to create a jungle that looked cold and dark, an image far removed from the radiant warmth often associated with the tropics. The film is also tinted with a misty haze which not only adds an aura of mystique, but also an element of repetition. It becomes increasingly difficult for audiences to recognize their surroundings in the forest as they too become lost in a sea of pale desaturated browns and greens. Unfortunately, cinematography can only go so far in telling a story and haunting, beautiful images can’t dilute a cluttered plot.
Next to the stunning array of films on display in the New York Film Festival’s Main Slate, “Tragic Jungle” is a sad afterthought. Perhaps that's indicative of the caliber of films Olaizola’s latest is up against, or perhaps it can be attributed to this reviewer’s lack of prior cultural knowledge. But it wouldn’t be surprising if “Tragic Jungle” found itself in the growing wastebasket of promising but ultimately forgettable films the second it finishes its festival run.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Red and blue campaign signs compete against the fading yellow and greens of Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, where Davis J. Tyler-Dudley ’21 and his blockmates are spending the semester. In between school work and extracurriculars, the group spends any free moment available participating in campaign and voter registration phone banks.
Immersed in this ever-present political scenery, most of them will be casting their ballots this fall in a swing state. Tyler-Dudley has observed “a lot of distrust” in both government and institutions more broadly.
“I think that no matter what way [the election] goes we're going to see a huge degree of skepticism towards the results of that election, which is very concerning to me as I think people's faith in the electoral process has been undermined,” Tyler-Dudley added, with the tone of a veteran diplomat. “And I think that's going to see very serious impacts on people's belief in the power of democracy in the United States.”
Tyler-Dudley’s personal experiences confirm a sentiment that, from my liberal haven in Cambridge, I’ve been feeling too: The fall of democracy is upon us.
Right now, we’re witnessing the erosion of trust in government, civic and human rights, and the shared premises that enable our collaboration and survival. Regardless of who you are and who you plan to vote for, the stakes in this election feel excruciatingly high.
Kate A. Gundersen ’23, who writes for the Harvard Political Review, painted a similarly bleak picture in an email: “I fear that the biggest threat to democracy is the constant manipulation of information, the dissemination of misinformation, and the President's attacks on the ‘Fake News.’”
Christopher Ong ’22 who applied to be a poll worker in Las Vegas after learning there was a shortage, expressed concern over lawsuits aiming to restrict access to the polls and make it easier for mail-in ballots to be rejected, disproportionately affecting Black Americans.
Democracy has, of course, progressed in the past two hundred years through the extension of voting rights to citizens other than white men. Still, the ability to vote does not amount to democracy as such, even if we often grant it that power in our political discourse. The systems that make each vote count are equally important.
I like so many other Americans see one particular outcome as unacceptable. If President Donald J. Trump wins this fall, it will be a sure sign of the further deterioration of American democracy. Trump’s impeachment but non-conviction, performance of law and order through his deployment of federal agents to quell protests, refusal to assure a peaceful transition of power, and insistence on confirming a supreme court justice eight days before the election are only a few reasons why.
Although a Biden-Harris victory would bring a spring burgeoning with new possibilities and cause for optimism, to say a Biden presidency would be proof of “democracy” would be a deceptive exaggeration.
The many failures of democracy throughout the Trump presidency aren’t the failures of one man, but intended outcomes of the American political system's design. America has always been far from achieving the true ideal of democracy. Systemic roadblocks include: gerrymandering, voter suppression, inconsistent voting rights for the incarcerated, corrupt campaign financing policies, and an electoral college system that led to the majority of voters in 2016 not having their choice become President.
But the fall of democracy takes on another meaning. This autumn, we’re digging in — across a divided nation, outside our bubble, we’re staging important fights. Civic duty and political participation are being taken up with unmatched energy, passion, and creativity. Dispersed across the globe, Harvard students have gained a more nuanced picture of the American politics and its varied stakes — from the Pocono Mountains to Vegas Strip.
“We tend to forget that Harvard is a bubble, a little progressive bubble,” Blake Barclay ‘22 said, calling me from Florida. He’s chair of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Harvard Institute of Politics, which gives him a particularly piercing view of this bubble.
“Where I live, Trump is exceedingly popular still,” he said. “The vast majority of people are voting for Trump, which is a far cry from when I was in Cambridge and New York where I'm not sure I could find a Trump supporter if I tried.”
Indeed, the Harvard bubble has burst. We’re living at the borders of America’s deepest divisions. However, as we watch democracy decay so clearly before our eyes, we’re coalescing around a shared democratic spirit.
Menat N. Bahnasy '22, president of the Harvard College Democrats, noted the new possibilities for political activism opened by the societal ruptures caused by COVID-19. “What's truly amazing about this virtual and digital era is the opportunity that it has given us to engage in democracy in even more ways than in-person,” she wrote in an email.
Likewise, Kevin L. Ballen ’22 and Amanda R. Powers ’21, co-chairs of the Harvard Votes Challenge, are heartened by the democratic processes surging across the nation. “We have already seen record numbers of people voting by mail and early at the polls,” they shared in a joint statement. “On our own campus, we have seen success in that thousands of students have made a plan to vote with us. With this record turnout, we hope to see elected leaders that reflect young people's hopes and desires.”
My friend Fariba Mahmud ’22 recently published an ongoing list of reasons not to re-elect Trump that she has been curating for the past four years. “I Voted” stickers stamp my social media feed. Months after the murder of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter protests and the fight for justice continue.
Though we’re feeling it acutely now, every fall is a fall of democracy. As we gear up for the election, democracy seems to be collapsing in on itself; disagreement tests us; atrocities come into focus. And every year we have to come together to hold it up. Such is the great paradox of democracy — that it’s always by nature vulnerable, that its integrity relies on its fragility.
I have faith in democracy because I have faith in my generation. We have learned, early on in our lives, that democracy is never achieved. Democracy must be continually worked for — and it can only be worked for together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year after Harvard promised to think more deeply and differently about its complicity in slavery, its actions show the shallowness of its commitment.
In November 2019, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced a new $5 million initiative to study Harvard’s ties to slavery. Since 2007, Harvard faculty and students have been working on the “Harvard and Slavery” project in various iterations, documenting the lives of enslaved people who lived in Harvard Yard and enumerating the ways that Harvard profited from slavery, but this new initiative promised to go further. It would “encourage our broader university community to think seriously and rigorously about the continuing impact and legacy of slavery,” Bacow wrote, and “ensure that discussion and understanding about our past can help us think differently and move us ever closer to a Harvard where all of us can thrive.”
A year later, Harvard’s lawyers are in court attempting to dismiss a lawsuit over the University’s possession of images taken of enslaved people directly harmed by Harvard. In her suit, Tamara K. Lanier says that she is “a direct descendant of Renty and Delia,” two subjects in the images, and asks Harvard “to recognize her lineage and relinquish the daguerreotypes to her family.” These images, taken in 1850, show Renty and Delia stripped naked and photographed from all angles. Harvard’s star science professor Louis Agassiz commissioned the photographs as evidence for polygenism, a now debunked theory that people of different races belonged to different species. The images are currently kept at Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
“That photograph is like a hostage photograph,” writer Ta-Nehisi Coates said after seeing one of the daguerreotypes of Renty. “This is an enslaved black man with no choice being forced to participate in white supremacist propaganda — that's what that photograph was taken for."
Renty and Delia could not have consented to being photographed as specimens. As enslaved people, they did not have legal rights over their own bodies. Despite this coercion, Harvard’s refusal to settle indicates its belief that it has a right to own, display, and profit from these images over the Laniers’ objections.
Harvard’s actions in Lanier’s case show that its commitment to “think[ing] differently” about its complicity in slavery is puddle-deep. According to her complaint, Harvard has cast doubt on Lanier’s family history and dismissed her expertise. She asked the University to stop licensing the photographs of her ancestors, but Harvard approved the use of the photographs in a lavish new book published last month. The book’s foreword asks, “can any one person be the heir to these photographs, or does the responsibility for them fall to all of us to protect them as archival relics of history, to be studied, pondered, and reckoned with?” The following 500 pages make a case for the latter by continuing to treat the daguerreotypes as specimens for scholarly inquiry.
This kind of imperialist thinking animates the arguments that wealthy institutions use to justify keeping looted artifacts like the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes. In the era of Black Lives Matter, many museums and universities are confronting their racist and colonialist foundations, and some are taking small steps toward change. Earlier this month, the French National Assembly voted to return 26 stolen artifacts to Benin in a move that Benin President Patrice Talon called “strictly the minimum.”
Harvard’s brash handling of Lanier’s case shows that the University is not likely to repatriate its ill-gotten gains unless it is forced to do so. Like other institutions that receive federal funding, Harvard complies with the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which requires the return of sacred objects and human remains to Native nations and descendants. Although no such law protects the bodies of non-Native enslaved people or artifacts stolen from other continents, Harvard could still choose to return objects like the daguerreotypes. It has not done so.
The scholars who participate in Harvard’s new $5 million research initiative will undoubtedly produce admirable, important work. But their research should not distract anyone from Harvard’s actions. Discussions and acknowledgements mean nothing if Harvard continues to exploit people like Renty and Delia, and to treat their descendants as obstacles to be overcome.
Tamara Lanier is an expert on the harm Harvard has done in the past and continues to do in the present. If Harvard were serious about confronting the legacy of slavery, it would give Lanier the daguerreotypes immediately and ask what it could learn from her, rather than fighting her in court. Until Harvard changes its behavior, its Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery is just window-dressing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Election Day, in addition to selecting America’s next president, Massachusetts voters will vote on a ballot initiative that could determine what happens when your car breaks down in the state. How much is this outcome worth? At least $50 million.
Question 1 on Massachusetts ballots will ask voters to decide whether vehicle manufacturers should be required to make mechanical data transmitted wirelessly accessible to the vehicle owner and to independent repair facilities. This law will modify an existing 2013 “Right to Repair” law which mandates that mechanics get access to data stored inside vehicles in order to even the playing field between the repair services manufacturers (which tried to hoard this data) and independent repair shops can offer.
But what happens when the data isn’t stored in a car itself, but in the cloud? Increasingly, auto repair shops can’t just plug a cable into a car and extract all of the mechanical data that might be relevant to a repair; more and more of this data is wirelessly transmitted.
Advocates of Question 1’s proposed modification to the 2013 “Right to Repair” law claim it will allow auto service companies to compete fairly against auto dealerships when offering repair services in an increasingly cordless age. The law seeks to protect against a future in which auto manufacturers have an oligopoly on accessing wirelessly transmitted mechanical data and can consequently upcharge for superior service informed by data only they can access.
The battle between big car and big repair has been expensive, with at least $50 million spent on lobbying so far between both sides. In the war over telematics, the Coalition for Auto Repair Equity, backed by Jiffy Lube, Firestone, and AutoZone, among other big name repair companies, stands opposed to the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data, funded almost exclusively by motor vehicle manufacturers, such as General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda. Though the latter group has outspent the former, neither seems to be the messenger of the people. The scale of this financial battle speaks to the continued need for campaign finance reform in order to make our democratic processes, not least the direct democracy of ballot questions, more equitable and representative.
Still, when the rubber hits the road, we find the efforts of car manufacturers to be disingenuous. Through a coalition billed as advocating for data privacy, they are driving a fear-mongering campaign, hyperbolizing concerns over cybersecurity, and preying on voters’ data privacy worries, so that voters will relinquish their choices when it comes to getting auto repairs.
Inequitable access to mobile telematic data will further hinder the repair shops’ ability to compete with dealership repairs, not only hurting the repair shops, but also low-income drivers who rely on these shops to provide a less expensive alternative to dealership repairs. We encourage voters to put the brakes on the unfair advantage auto manufacturers will increasingly have by voting “Yes” on Ballot Question 1, guaranteeing the “right to repair” in Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Knowing somebody’s coffee order is one of my favorite litmus tests for familiarity.
By my freshman year of college, I had his order memorized: a small black coffee and a cinnamon bagel, with peanut butter on the side. When we met for the last time before quarantine, I ordered for him; he paid.
He is a Vietnam war veteran, softball coach, and real estate agent. He is eccentric and old enough to be my grandfather but not loopy — his eyes are limpid and alert, and he remembers the minutiae of our conversations, from my summer plans to my roommates’ classes. He is my only friend above age 60, and he has political beliefs I profoundly disagree with. And yet I have lost sleep over the possibility that he might contract coronavirus.
All of my columns so far have focused on strangers who remained strangers, people whom I would likely not recognize should I run into them again. This week, I want to write about a stranger who became a friend.
Perhaps all of our friends are originally strangers, but many are known to us in some way before they become our friends: They are our classmates, colleagues, teammates, or friends of friends; we start with an outline of our connection to them and arrive at friendship by shading in particulars.
I am speaking of a different sort of friendship, one that emerged from chance repeated encounters. I met the man whose coffee order I now have memorized because he was a substitute teacher at my high school. That we were in the same place at the same point in time — a high school classroom on a Friday afternoon — was entirely incidental: He happened to be assigned to that room on the day I was supposed to be learning something in it.
He substituted regularly; we saw each other maybe once a month, every month, all four years of high school. During my senior year, I found his birthday through the school registrar and gave him home-baked blueberry crumble. He was one of the first people to congratulate me on my acceptance to Harvard. He called me “Crimson,” and when he suggested that we meet in Harvard Square when I was officially a college student, I did him one better and said that we should make it a regular occasion.
When we meet, he talks about his grandchildren and I talk about school. Sometimes we talk about politics. We both dislike President Donald Trump but for very different reasons, and our shared political inclinations do not extend very far beyond that. He reminds me to care about things I know are important but rarely remember the plight of veterans, social security, and deteriorating infrastructure.
These are issues I associate with a different generation, and I don’t think about them often because I don’t have any other friends who are, to put it colloquially, boomers. In fact, I know very few Harvard students who have friends that are significantly older than they are. Aside from the oldsters we are required to interact with — relatives, professors, and professional colleagues — our social networks are wholly homogeneous with respect to age.
This is not surprising; we are not afforded many opportunities to befriend older people. But the politics of the age gap are increasingly sharp. Although older people have long leaned conservative, the last two decades have shown a wider political chasm emerging around age. In the 2018 midterms, Gen Z and young Millenials — people under 30 — favored Democrats by two to one, compared to an even Democrat-Republican split in voters over 65.
Myriad factors feed into this age gap. More and more older people silo themselves ideologically in social media echo chambers; they represent the fastest growing social media user demographic. Norms and language matter, too; growing up with same-sex couples on TV and a vocabulary that included “intersectionality” and “institutionalized racism” gave my generation a vastly different starting point.
I should also emphasize that I do not refer to either “my generation” or “older people” as monolithic political entities: Many boomers were leaders in the anti-war, civil rights, and women’s liberation movements; gender, race, geography, and class all muddy any universalizing age-based political assumptions.
But on some issues, the age difference in politics is undeniable and clearcut: Roughly half of people older than 55 worry about global warming, compared to 70 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds. Older white Americans are far less likely to express support for the Black Lives Matter movement compared to younger Americans.
Like many members of my generation, I feel an intense but nebulous resentment toward older people for bequeathing a figuratively and literally burning planet. My friendship with an older person cannot dampen that existential ire.
But I write this piece on the precipice of a brutal pandemic winter, in which tens if not hundreds of thousands of older Americans are expected to die. If we remain socially disconnected from the elderly, we are destined to view these deaths not as tragedies but as statistics — or worse, a perverse good riddance, a necessary separation of chaff that allows for political progress.
I do not know how my friend will vote. But our cross-generational, unexpected friendship is a constant reminder that though we may not always see eye to eye, we can at least sit across a table and share a cup of coffee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard History Professor Nancy F. Cott and Brown History Professor Samuel Zipp shared the stories of five twentieth century American internationalists and the legacy of their writings in a Mahindra Humanities Center webinar Monday.
The event, which was titled “Hidden Histories of U.S. Internationalists,” featured the professors’ latest works on American engagement in international affairs.
After summarizing their books, the two historians took part in a discussion moderated by MIT History Professor Christopher Capozzola ’94.
Mahindra Humanities Center Executive Director Steven H. Biel said Cott proposed pairing her latest book, “Fighting Words: The Bold American Journalists Who Brought the World Home,” with Zipp’s, “The Idealist: Wendell Willkie’s Wartime Quest to Build One World,” for the event. Both books highlight the work of influential U.S. internationalists.
“She suggested the pairing of Samuel Zipp’s book and her recent book would go well together and would resonate in this moment, especially in the lead up to the election,” Biel said.
In her book, Cott focuses on American journalists Dorothy Thompson, Vincent Sheean, John Gunther, and Rayna Raphaelson, who reported on international politics in the 1920s and 1930s.
“They sent back home their reportage, their commentary, which acted like searchlights sweeping across foreign turbulence and politics,” Cott said.
Similarly, Zipp wrote about how Wendell Willkie, a U.S. politician and writer, pushed for international cooperation and global anti-racism in the 1940s.
In her presentation, Cott said global interconnectedness through communication technology and economic interdependence enabled her four characters’ works to become “searchlights.”
“My book became more of a history lesson for today than I would have anticipated,” Cott said, noting the similarities between her subjects’ writings about limitations on press freedoms in the 1920s and 1930s and disinformation by modern governments today.
Zipp said he thinks of his book as a sequel to Cott’s work, noting that Willkie was influenced by Cott’s four focuses and similarly pushed American attention abroad.
However, he added Willkie’s vision of “one world” has since been largely dismissed as idealistic, despite its dramatic popularity during his lifetime.
In the question and answer session, the historians delved more into their writing processes, discussing the role individual narratives played in their accounts of the interwar years and World War II.
They also spoke to characterizations of America in the twentieth century, arguing against the idea that the United States became “more isolationist” after World War I.
In an interview with The Crimson before the event, Zipp drew a parallel between 20th-century isolationism and public perceptions of internationalism today.
“Today, I think a lot of people are interested in American benefits that globalization brings, but not so much the responsibilities,” Zipp said.
He added that the current administration’s “America First” ideology mimics that of the 1940s.
“The ideas in this book could become even more important for us to think about,” Zipp said.
Capozzola posed a final question to both Cott and Zipp at the end of the webinar: “Are there some authentic characters today who you see carrying on legacies in journalism or in political culture in building internationalism?”
Cott and Zipp agreed that many journalists are doing great work to draw the public’s attention abroad, but Zipp said more work must be done to educate Americans.
“I think it’s a matter of activating more people’s expansive relationship to the world and seeing that that’s happening all around us all the time,” Zipp said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will continue all instruction and cohort-building activities for the spring 2021 semester remotely, GSAS Dean Emma Dench wrote in an email to students last week.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, GSAS launched an Emergency Support Initiative in May to provide emergency funding and fellowship appointments for students adversely affected by the pandemic. In July, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced that learning would be remote for the fall term.
Dench wrote that GSAS is currently reviewing responses to a spring planning survey sent out to students earlier this month. She added that upon completion of the review, GSAS will host a town hall for graduate students to voice their concerns about the spring term.
Seung Hee Oh, a fifth-year graduate student in History of Art and Architecture, said given the continuation of online learning, she hopes GSAS will allow students more library access in the spring.
“I don’t really hope to have full library access, but at least limited,” Oh said. “There should be a way to limit the number of people who enter the building, but right now it looks like they’re not making any procedures.”
GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an emailed statement that students have been able to establish relationships within their cohorts despite the limitations of a virtual campus.
“Many programs identified successful ways to encourage cohort-building — for example by holding regular coffee hours and organizing informal academic discussion groups,” Hall wrote.
GSAS will enter phase four of its Emergency Support Initiative in the spring, continuing to provide grants to offset tuition or health plan fees for certain advanced doctoral students. Additionally, GSAS will now fund visiting fellow appointments — full-time independent research positions — for PhD students graduating in November and March, allowing students to continue to “remain members of the Harvard community.”
GSAS rolled out its Emergency Support Initiative in phases to address “the greatest need” at a particular time, Hall wrote. The initiative is partially financed by donations from the school’s alumni and supporters, according to the GSAS website.
“The grants for fall and spring are directed at students who are outside the financial support package and would have paid tuition and fees out of pocket,” Hall wrote.
Samuel J. Moy, a sixth-year graduate student in Health Policy, said he did not apply for emergency funding because he assumed other students with greater financial need could benefit more from the program’s limited funds.
“The nature of my research is such that compared to someone who has to go into the lab to get research done or conduct field work, there’s comparatively little disruption to my graduate studies,” Moy said. “It’s certainly not as relevant for me as it could be for other people.”
Dench affirmed GSAS would continue to support students academically and financially in the spring, even with the semester’s online format.
“I want to assure you that despite the uncertainty presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, GSAS continues to work with University leadership and others to increase opportunities for students to conduct their research and to identify funding that can expand student support,” Dench wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council adopted a pair of motions to allocate funds toward a new records management system that aggregates police activity and toward a project to house the city’s homeless population in its meeting Monday.
The new records management system will feature a public dashboard that highlights routine traffic stops made by police. The system, which the city’s Public Safety Information Technology Division will oversee, should improve police transparency and help evaluate the presence of bias in law enforcement, according to Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon.
Mallon said at the meeting that it is “long past time” the city adopted such a system.
“There has been such a need for transparency and accountability in policing and never more urgently than over the last couple of months,” she said. “I’m excited to be like the first city in the country to be providing this type of public transparency.”
Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr., said the department’s current records management system, which is more than a quarter-century old, has “outlived its usefulness.”
“The current system doesn’t have the functionality to carry out dashboard technology, so we were dead in the water,” he said.
Bard said it will take eight to ten months to compile the traffic stop data. Once the department gathers the data, the city will analyze it for officer bias.
“The primary concern will be the traffic stop data,” he said. “Once that’s done, then we’ll develop a process to also see what, if any, difference exists in how we treat individuals when we use force.”
During Monday’s meeting, the city also adopted a motion to allocate funds obtained through the CARES Act toward housing homeless individuals.
Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff said the Cambridge Housing Authority has committed between 40 and 45 housing vouchers to individuals who are chronically homeless.
Semonoff also said Homestart, a Boston-based housing provider, will work to house individuals for periods from 18 months to up to two years.
During the public hearing portion of the virtual meeting, nearly a dozen Cambridge residents touted a policy order that would prohibit the use of tear gas in Cambridge.
Cambridge resident Emily Griffin urged councilors to vote in favor of the policy, citing health and safety concerns.
“Since tear gas can exacerbate respiratory distress and makes citizens vulnerable to complications from COVID, for the health and safety of Cantabrigians, I urge you to vote in support of policy order five,” she said.
Jonathan Behrens, another Cambridge resident, proposed extending the policy to restrict the purchasing of tear gas.
“The distinction might seem silly, but we discovered earlier this year that the Cambridge Police Department actually did have a stockpile of it, even though they were banned from using it,” he said.
Cambridge police officers are not allowed to use tear gas, per department policy. Still, Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler said the ordinance would strengthen the existing policy and might inspire other cities to do the same.
While Councilor E. Denise Simmons said she supported the legislation in principle, she argued its phrasing needed further refining and thus exercised her charter right to postpone the measure.

Sure, normal on-campus festivities aren’t an option, and 2020 has been pretty spooky overall, but you should still consider celebrating Halloween this year for the sake of tradition. Besides using a cobweb-filled Zoom background and being terrified of your looming pset due date, there are still ways to celebrate the holiday, even if you can’t be with your friends.
Plan a Zoom scary movie night with friends. 
We all need a break from the busy semester, so why not treat yourself to a Halloween movie to forget about the real terrors of your life (aka your paper due tomorrow)? Relive your childhood memories by enjoying an evening of “Ghostbusters,” “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” or “Coraline.” Once you’ve selected your movie, set up a date and time for your screening and send out a Zoom link to your closest friends. If you’re all overachievers, dress up as characters of the movie, or at least try out some Zoom filters.
Have a pumpkin hunt. 
This is basically a fall version of an Easter egg hunt. Order a bunch of cute little pumpkins, spread them outside if the weather permits or hide them inside around the house, and have a competition to see who can fill up their trick-or-treating basket the fastest. (Of course, remember to be safe and follow all COVID-19 guidelines.) Later, carve these pumpkins into jack-o-lanterns and use the fillings to bake a delicious pumpkin pie. There’s so much you can do with these beautiful orange fruits!
Look up at the night sky.
For those of you who haven't heard, there will be a full moon on the night of Halloween, which happens once every nineteen years. Channel your inner werewolf and gaze up at the night sky on October 31, and if you want to take this activity a step further, wear your fuzziest pajamas, set up a campfire, and make some s’mores. Extra points if you howl.
Mail candy to your friends.
We are not quite at the season of giving just yet, but an act of kindness is welcome year round. If one of your blockmates has three midterms coming up, make their life a little sweeter with a small box of Skittles or Rice Krispies. This is an especially thoughtful gift for friends with younger siblings who are missing out on trick-or-treating this year.
Despite the circumstances, this year’s Halloween can still be memorable. If all else fails, study for your upcoming midterm. Sure, this is not exactly how you imagined the renowned weekend to go, but let’s be honest — what’s scarier than physics?

With Halloween coming up, you’re probably wondering how to celebrate on the 31st on campus. COVID-19 is still very much a thing and so are the restrictions placed on students, but take this quiz to figure out how to have a “boo-tiful” (I’m sorry) Halloween despite them.
What’s your go-to Halloween snack?
A) Pop Rocks — Like this bright, popping candy, you like to go crazy during all holidays. You’re outgoing and are always looking for a good time and to catch people’s attention.
B) Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups — A classic choice of candy to match your favorite type of evening: a laid back, fun, chill night with friends.
C) M&Ms — This low-effort, affordable snack is easy to toss in your mouth as you lay on the couch. M&Ms are totally your speed: slow and slothsome.
D) I don’t like candy — Um, why? I guess that’s beside the point. You’re the type of person who maybe has an aversion to candy (and parties) or prefers healthier treats (and alone time).
There’s a Halloween party tonight that you just got invited to. What do you go as?
A) Pennywise the clown — No amount of makeup, no extraneous wig, no multi-piece costume is too much for you to put together, even at the last minute.
B) The devil — A red outfit (maybe a cape too) and some red devil horns are a classic choice for you.
C) A Yale student — You would throw on a Yale sweater over your t-shirt (if you can even stand the thought of doing this) and that’s it.
D) No costume — You’d dress up as a sleep-deprived student, maybe with a “this is my costume” t-shirt.
How do you like to decorate for Halloween?
A) Spider webs, gravestones, dangling skeletons, spooky lights, fake blood, inflatable pumpkins. You name it, you’ve got it.
B) A few jack-o-lanterns and string lights (that may have been up since Christmas) in your window.
C) A singular mini pumpkin on your desk.
D) Why bother decorating if you just have to take the decorations down in a couple of days?
What do you carve on a pumpkin?
A) The most intricate design possible.
B) A classic crooked smile.
C) You’d maybe purchase a pumpkin from Trader Joe’s.
D) Needless to say, you have never and will never get a pumpkin for Halloween.
What type of trick-or-treater were you?
A) The aggressive one who ignores all “take one please” signs, grabbing multiple handfuls instead.
B) The rule abider who would wait patiently to receive a treat, would always say thank you, and would always, always, just take one.
C) The shy one who would rarely stray from their older sibling or parent’s side.
D) The one who never trick-or-treated and stayed home and never answered the door for trick-or-treaters.
Results:
Mostly As: The Party Animal (No ♥)
You are clearly ready to go all out for Halloween this year, so you may as well head over to BU for a crazy, not-so-socially-distant party. Oh wait, we’re living in a global pandemic. And we get it, maybe you’re looking to forget a pset that’s due or a long week on Zoom, or you want to blow off some steam, but, no. You’ll probably end up on Samyra’s story somehow, or worse.
Mostly Bs: Festive, But Chill
You’ve likely got the spirit and have already decorated your entire dorm room. While respecting Dean Khurana’s reminders about restrictions, grab as much candy as possible from CVS, get a pumpkin or two from Trader Joe’s, line up a hearty selection of Halloween movies, find a bed sheet and a projector, get a group of friends together (again, making sure to follow local guidelines on group size limits), and have yourself a classic, festive celebration outside.
Mostly Cs: Lazy, But Always Up for Free Food
While you’re not super into Halloween on a good year, let alone in 2020, you don’t mind taking part in festivities if you get free candy and an excuse to blow off homework for a night out of the deal. You may consider finding a person who chose “Mostly Bs” to handle the logistics while you get to reap the rewards with minimal effort.
Mostly Ds: The One Who Isn’t Feeling It
In 2020, every day is pretty scary, so what makes the 31st of October so special? Why not stay in your room and go to bed early in protest against Halloween this year? Maybe you can pick up some discount Halloween candy from CVS the day after. Maybe.
