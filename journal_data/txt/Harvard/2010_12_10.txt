After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Class of 2014 experiences reading period for the first time, many students find themselves struggling with the stresses of impending finals. Cognizant of the generally tense atmosphere, members of Freshman Seminar 36s: “Movement and Meaning: Dance, Culture, and Identity in the 20th Century” decided to take a unique approach to their final project. All 15 members collaborated in putting together a surprise flash mob dance in Annenberg Hall yesterday at 12:20pm in the hopes of “[using] creativity as a medium to reach out to people around us,” says Akshay M. Sharma ’14, one student in the class. “I hope that our message to break out of the monotony of studying that is bogging all of us down not only reaches the people who we asked to participate, but those who were able to gain a smile out of our shenanigans.”
This is the first time that an entire class taking the “Movement and Meaning” seminar decided to work together on a creative final project. Professor Jessica C. Berson finds this initiative thrilling.  “It's exactly the sort of risky, innovative learning that the Freshman Seminar Program seeks to encourage,” she says. “Flash mobs are a relatively recent underground community performance form, and have been used for social and political activism as well as inciting general good will. It's great to see Harvard students use this new idiom to stake a claim for dance in such a visible public forum.”
Throughout the seminar, the students explored a variety of dance genres ranging from ballet to break dance to contact improvisation. Simpler elements were taken from these dance forms in the creation of the flash mob choreography. “We wanted to send a message of relaxation and having fun during reading period, and having that direction was key in—and very helpful for—our choreography,” says Shira B. Kogan ’14. “Another important consideration was making sure that the moves are full of energy, and are easy enough for people, especially non-dancers, to learn in a short period of time… We also wanted to make it so that if people wanted to, they could potentially catch on and join the flash mob even if they were not originally a part of it.”
In fact, not only did approximately 100 freshmen gather together in this surprise flash mob, several Annenberg staff workers even joined in on the creative project. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and other university officials were also in attendance. Dingman seemed impressed with the performance; he “thought the student organizers did an awesome job (as did the Annenberg staff) and was glad that the freshmen had a chance to kick back and appreciate one another,” he wrote in an email.
Support from outside the class helped to encourage the students. Paula M. Maouyo ’14 says, “I was initially concerned about how feasible it would be, but thankfully we've gotten really encouraging responses both from the administration and from participating students.”
Planning the flash mob, however, was not completely smooth sailing. In addition to recruiting all of the flash mob participants and creating accessible choreography, the class had to make several attempts to receive permission from the Freshman Dean’s Office (FDO) to use Annenberg for their project and legitimize it as an academic endeavor. “I feel unbelievably privileged to have the opportunity to use Annenberg as a venue, because the FDO does not allow any student groups to perform there,” says Michael Lai ’14. “In terms of getting FDO permission... Dean Dingman said the FDO senior staff had brought up the flash mob in a meeting and loved the idea but decided against giving us permission, because they were afraid it would open a Pandora's box for other student organizations to perform in Annenberg. I was adamant that Annenberg would be the ideal venue; he asked me to submit a proposal if I really thought I had a case to make. The rest is history.”
Members of the freshman seminar hope that the flash mob will bring a happier, lighter mood to reading period this year.  They believe that this flash mob will also serve as an illustration of how dance can serve a greater purpose in uniting students from all backgrounds through art.

In an effort to reevaluate its responsibilities and workings in a “thoughtful and forward-looking way with an eye for sweeping improvement,” the Harvard Corporation announced this week that it will undergo a structural overhaul in order to implement critical reforms during a time of growing complexity for the greater Harvard community. Emerging from the longstanding 17th century governing configuration, the changes should allow the Corporation to better address new 21st century challenges and demands following criticism that stresses a lack of transparency, accountability, and community engagement. In light of such critiques, the Corporation’s move to nearly double its membership and form several new committees is a step in the right direction, as we expect that it will add diversity of opinion and expand the body’s proficiency in various realms. Likewise, we anticipate that the newly instated term limits will increase members’ responsiveness. However, while we appreciate that the Corporation is trying to address the criticisms levied at it, we hope to see further reform to resolve issues of transparency.
The governance review examined century-old structures and responsibilities that necessitated alteration to adapt to the current needs of the University. In the context of a newly enlarged Corporation that includes a greater diversity of opinions and experiences, the creation of several new committees is positive, as it will allow for specialization to more fully address specific needs of the Harvard community. Drawing from the specialized skill set of a wider membership, the Corporation will be better equipped to plan the future of the University and make critical decisions relating to its policy and strategy within the ever-changing fiscal climate.
Until now, the president and six other members have comprised the Corporation. Although adding six additional members should provide useful perspective, these individuals will be appointed by existing Corporation members themselves. As the Corporation aims to serve the greater Harvard community, accountability is particularly crucial; thus, the self-appointment policy requires reform. We hope that until this policy can be reexamined, Corporation members will hold one another accountable through the new term limits, which establish a six-year service period with the opportunity to extend service for six more years thereafter.
While the steps outlined this week are commendable, they do not appear to address a crucial shortcoming of the Corporation: it’s lack of transparency. The body must make efforts to keep the greater community better informed about its goals, proceedings, and decisions, and further reform may be necessary to institutionalize communication.
Despite these shortcoming, the restructuring underway promises to alter the future proceedings of the Corporation for the better, reflecting constructive dialogue on the part of the Governance Review Committee.

Imagine a place where your personal wealth isn’t measured by the money in your bank account but by the smile on your face. Imagine a place where material things and economic status don’t make you rich, but rather your experiences and the relationships that you form with others are the measures of your wealth. During the holiday season, we can often get caught up in our material belongings and our own personal lives. What if the government switched from measuring Gross Domestic Product to Gross National Happiness and the purpose of every decision that the government made—and what we strived for—was to increase each other’s happiness? Under King Jigme Singye Wangchuc, the small Himalayan country of Bhutan adopted the measurement of GNH in 1972 and has been working toward the good of its people ever since. So what can the Bhutanese youth and Harvard students trained in leadership learn from each other?
Even though Bhutan has one of the lowest household incomes in the world, the country strives to increase national wellbeing by taking into consideration things like time spent with family, the conservation of natural resources (it is required that at least 60 percent of its forests remain intact), and other non-monetary factors that influence the standard of living. Although Bhutan had no public school system until 1960, it now cycles teachers through cities and rural areas, so all students have equal access to the best education. As one of its initiatives, the Bhutan Ministry of Education contacted the Harvard Leadership Institute’s Social Outreach Committee in 2008 to plan and implement leadership curriculum in Bhutanese schools. The Ministry wants its students to develop the confidence and tools to take ownership for what happens in their country in the present and in the future. The Leadership Institute, under the guidance of Lectuere on Sociology David Ager, has been working on the framework for leadership programs in the context of GNH and Bhutanese culture. This J-term, they will travel to the small Buddhist country to lay the groundwork for a lasting relationship between the Leadership Institute and the Bhutanese education system.
A team of six social outreach committee members will travel to Bhutan on Jan. 6 for two weeks. During the first week, they will be exploring and taking a crash course in Bhutanese culture and tradition, and during the second week, they will meet with twenty teachers to share and teach their leadership pilot program to a selected fifty students from different schools. While the Harvard students have to pay for their airfare, the government is so eager to have them participate in this cultural exchange that it is providing their living arrangements and food expenses during the trip. The Harvard students know that in order to be good leaders, they have some learning to do as well.
“On the one hand, you have six Harvard students trying to convey the essentials of leadership and social change over an intense five-day period to a Bhutanese audience,” Ujunwa Anakwenze '13 concedes. “ On the other, you have a hand-picked group of 50 motivated Bhutanese teenagers and 20 teachers challenging us to think on our feet as we struggle to piece together the inner workings of their culture.”
Fellow team member Akansha Tarun '13 agrees that the experience will be “both humbling and exciting at the same time."
The students realize that two weeks isn’t enough time to implement a curriculum to its fullest, so this is just the first of hopefully many trips to Bhutan to work with their youth on leadership skills. The Social Outreach team expects this trip to give them a better lens through which to restructure their curriculum as well as provide valuable insight into how the government and the people use the resources available to make the most of what they have.
While Bhutan’s system of GNH certainly isn’t perfect, the idea of striving for happiness rather than material satisfaction is a noble one. As our holiday wish lists get longer, and as our parents groan about the state of the economy, perhaps it wouldn’t hurt to adopt a bit of the Bhutanese mentality. We can do this by working toward achieving our greatest individual happiness by helping others achieve theirs, or by appreciating how lucky we are to be surrounded by inspiring peers and professors. As per my favorite Sheryl Crow song “Soak Up the Sun,” “it’s not having what you want, it’s wanting what you got."

In a political climate where climate change and alternative energy top the list of scientific national priorities, scientists tend to find themselves on the same side of the aisle as regulators—fighting business interests to advocate stricter protections for the environment. As such, the case of personal genomics stands in marked contrast. Despite the insistence of authorities in genetic science, medicine, and biochemistry, congressional regulators lately have been moving toward bans or heavy restrictions on the commercial sale of genetic tests for disease-related alleles. Categorizing personal genomics tests as “medical devices,” a July 2010 report of an undercover investigation by the General Accountability Office regulators reported that, direct-to-consumer genetic tests are “misleading and of little or no practical use.” In advance of two July hearings by the Food and Drug Administration on the subject, FDA officials warned that the tests are “high risk.”
Regarding the FDA and GAO’s concerns about the diagnostic power of these tests, it would indeed be troubling if millions of consumers were buying genomics tests with the intention of providing primary diagnoses for common ailments. This is simply not the case: The only tests claimed to be diagnostic are those for alleles that directly cause conditions, like Huntington’s disease and red hair. And for the most part, the group of people using personal genomics tests today self-selects for education and scientific skepticism.
Moreover, new regulation would stand to restrict customers’ access to personal genetic information, close off options for preventive health screening, and stifle incentives for innovation and research in genetic science and its applications. It represents a current of paranoia about advances in genetics that is, by and large, wholly irrational.
Regulatory action is unjustifiable for one, because it represents a fundamental restriction of freedom of information, enshrined as a right in the U.S. by extensive legislative protection. Despite the fact that the American government has grown to accept that it should not restrict public access to general-domain knowledge, it seems unsure of whether genetic information falls under the same scope.
At the very least, personal genetic information is no less a channel of information than any data relating to healthcare expenditures or population figures. Although scientists have yet to piece together what every gene means, it is a matter of simple biological principle that DNA contains the lion’s share of information at the foundation of life.
Accordingly, the restriction of direct-to-consumer genomics testing denies consumers easy access to the best research available on the subject of health and personal genetics. As it stands, the testing firm 23andMe conducts genomics scans that can provide information about one’s risk for over 170 diseases and health conditions. Despite FDA allegations that 23andMe and about a dozen peer companies have misrepresented the capabilities of their tests, about 100,000 consumers—myself included—have signed up for personal genomics testing, informed to some extent that the results generated rarely serve as an adequate diagnosis.
Moreover, government regulation of genomics testing denies consumers the available range of options for personal health assessment. At the date of this writing, 23andMe offers a $99 comprehensive scan of known disease markers and alleles. This is certainly more affordable for many than the treatment of conditions left unpredicted and undetected.
Perhaps most important, however, new regulation of the personal genomics industry will serve to stifle innovation and research in the emerging field of applied genetics.
With the entire human genome sequenced, researchers are making remarkable strides in the areas of genetic modification, disease screening, and population genetics. Demand for research has largely been impelled forward by private-sector interest in the implications of DNA advances. 23andMe came into being when market-keen researchers realized that amateur population genetics enthusiasts, were tired of only being able to comprehensively test their Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA.
Motivated by demand for targeted genetic modification, J. Craig Venter’s Celera Genomics Group has sequenced the entire human genome, leaving the federally funded Human Genome Project nearly “in the dust.” His new business venture, the Synthetics Group, has attracted $110 million in investment to create synthetic life forms. It strikes me as amiss that the government would seek to interfere with this process.
Ultimately, Congress would be sorely misguided to approve sweeping regulation of the genomics industry. To the chagrin of consumers and researchers alike, consequences for information and the pursuit of science would be far-ranging and constraining. All in the name, of course, of “protection”—even if it’s not in the league of scientific issues threatening the world’s safety.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you don’t think that hackers hold an appeal to pop culture as the anti-establishment champions of the cyber age, wait for next year’s English language release of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” which will feature Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, solving a decades-old mystery with the help of the now-famous punk hacker, Lisbeth Salander.
In the Stieg Larsson novels, Salander operates under the handle ‘Wasp’ in a network of the world’s best hackers, such as ‘Plague.’ For her troubles in the novel, Salander uses her hacking skills to wire herself billions of Swedish kroner from a crooked corporate titan.
In real-life Sweden, authorities await the possible extradition from the United Kingdom of another well-known hacker, who, as in Larsson’s books, named himself  ‘Mendax’ after a pithy Horace phrase. Like Wasp, Mendax enjoys sex, but unlike her, Mendax has also become a well-known public figure. Famous hackers apparently live the rock star life, in which two women take you in as a safe place to stay, and you naturally sleep with both of them. If they later claim that you forced them to have sex after you stopped using protection, however, you will get denied bail.
It’s tough being Mendax. It’s not as easy to rob billionaires as Larsson made it look. You made some cash by writing a book about hacking, and now you tell interviewers “It’s very annoying to see modern day articles calling me a computer hacker. I’m not ashamed of it, I’m quite proud of it,” you say.
Such labels get in the way of your crusade, however—a whistleblower website that holds all nations and major corporations accountable for their actions, revealing as many secrets as possible. Secrets are only dangerous if there’s something to hide, you maintain, as the nations of the world line up in sharp disagreement. It’s bad enough that former associates such as the hacker ‘Mudge’ are always at work to stop information leaking. You need money to operate, not just the embraces of the women who harbor you.
So your group asks for donations to operate. The corporations, however, aren’t having it. You want to skewer Bank of America soon, and they are in a war room bracing for it. The world is at your fingertips, but those donations just won’t get through! Amazon.com won’t let you use its servers, PayPal won’t accept the donations for you, and Visa and MasterCard also won’t let you use their products.
Ah, Mendax, you still have hacker friends. These real-life hackers are good. Their organizing group, Anonymous, has attacked the Church of Scientology before; now it’s time to use Twitter to coordinate attacks on anyone who has wronged you. Not just the credit card companies—the Swedish government must pay. Sarah Palin must pay. She doesn’t like Mendax much? Down with her website. ‘Operation: Payback’ could definitely use a Salander in its ranks, though—it can’t dent Amazon’s servers and has struggled several times to slow down PayPal.
Threatening these companies, however, will somehow free you, Mendax. When Twitter bans its use as a hacker rallying point, they can just go after Twitter. There’s no end in sight. Mendax already cut the New York Times out of his group’s preferred publications; maybe Forbes blogger Andy Greenberg should be shut down next, for covering the hackers extensively.
As to the 16-year-old boy just arrested in The Hague and his computers seized? He is 16 years old, the same age you were, Mendax, when you started hacking. Certainly old enough to be sacrificed to fight the good fight against, well, secrecy. And Bradley Manning will be in prison far longer than you for getting the U.S. documents for the group. His arrest is unfortunate—but he is just a pawn. Let Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg fight for his release. We only need the big guns, the hackers, for when a corporation such as MasterCard cuts off payments to an organization engaged in illegal actions because it won’t facilitate such activity.
The hackers fight for WikiLeaks, but the organization does not show the same loyalty. Its spokesperson can “neither condemn nor applaud these attacks.” There must be some mistake, Mendax—we know you have strong convictions. We demand to see the internal cables within your organization that led to that public statement. We demand a whistleblower on how involved you are in these attacks, even if your overseas “War on Credit Cards” doesn’t implicate your name.
The old Mendax would appreciate that call for transparency—Lisbeth Salander, too. But you aren’t that idealistic hacker anymore, just Julian Assange.

With temperatures dropping and Christmas right around the corner, right now might be a great time to have a fireplace, especially if those pesky storm windows are stuck open. Unfortunately, this is not an option for Harvard undergraduates; the fireplaces can only taunt us from our common rooms, as they have been sealed up by University policy since 2002.
Why deprive us so? According to former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, students’ inability to use the fireplaces responsibly is to blame. “Over the course of time, fewer and fewer students were familiar with the concept of fireplaces and the fact that they had dampers that they had to open to let the smoke out,” he said.
Now cue the smoke alarms: despite our alleged brilliance, Harvard students’ misuse of fireplaces kept filling the dorms with smoke and provoking visits from the Cambridge Fire Department. There were also some more serious incidents which were “generally associated with the consumption of significant amounts of alcohol after exams were over,” according to Lewis. In one case, an inebriated student decided he would build a fire by burning his dried-out Christmas tree in his room. Instead of first chopping up the tree, he managed to push the Christmas tree into the fireplace as it burned.
In 2003, the Undergraduate Council proposed revoking the ban on fireplaces and increasing fire safety education in the College. The administration disagreed, since booze and stupidity influenced most students’ decisions to build a fire in the first place. “I don’t think this fellow with the Christmas tree really needed fire safety lessons,” said Lewis.

For a foodie, I had a spartan culinary upbringing.
Perhaps it began in utero, when my mother ate tomatoes by the bushel during her pregnancy, believing it’d lead to a smarter child.
Out I came, eight pounds of screaming joy, born to China’s new breed of post-Cultural Revolution, university-educated brethren. Becoming American was an unlikely reinvention for my father, whose family, up until a few years ago, lived in a two-room concrete building heated by a coal furnace. Chickens still roamed the dirt roads.
My family held onto every dollar, never forgetting how difficult they were to come by. While my father was a Ph.D. student, we rented the top floor of an old house in upstate New York, wearing jackets indoors to save money on heating and faithfully finishing the leftovers.
I didn’t feel so different from other kids back then. In elementary school, I qualified for a free school lunch, and I ate the same food as everyone else. Later on, my mother would pack strange lunches—fried rice with oil leaking out of the takeout container—and I remember feeling ashamed as I saw how my classmates’ lunches were so sterilized and scentless, so perfectly contained and uniform.
My parents did their best, and for the most part, I was very happy with what I had to eat. I never went hungry, and I did like my mother’s unambitious but earnest Chinese home cooking. When we wanted to celebrate, we would predictably choose one of the all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets nearby, no matter what the occasion. The $12.95 price tag seemed exorbitant at the time.
As I got older, the feeling of being different grew. First off, I was hungry—an unceasing, irrational kind of hungry that favored the novel to the familiar and the spicy to the bland. No one else ate quite as much as I did or savored every last crumb of a restaurant meal like I did.
I couldn’t understand why people picked Applebee’s for dinner given the chance to eat out, or why they always ordered the same thing and ate two bites before declaring they were “so full.” My conclusion, naturally, was that there was something wrong with me.
When I came to college and finally began eating out at restaurants other than Chinese buffets, I discovered that there was another entire world of food out there. Prior to this, I had thought eating at restaurants with entrees priced above $12 were for the wealthy. That’s why eating out was such a head rush at the time; I felt like a clever impostor, a pauper in prince’s clothing faking the life of a high roller.
I began to write about food almost by accident. Up until this point, all I knew was that eating out was the highlight of my week and I was prone to what looked like small seizures after eating something truly delicious. Writing on my blog about meals was therapeutic, a way to clarify those feelings and bring them into focus. I realized, unequivocally, that I loved food and experienced it more intensely than many other people. For the first time, my identity seemed descriptive rather than painfully different.
Unlike others, I don’t have the same backlog of food experience—outings to French bistros in Paris at age 12, or celebrating birthdays in four-star restaurants at age 16, say—but I do have a better grasp on how a restaurant is like a theater, how our food choices reflect our aspirations and insecurities, the contradictions between what we say and what we eat. For that, I have to thank my parents for teaching me to appreciate the experience of dining out. I encourage you to branch out and try new things as well; you may discover yourself in the process of figuring out what’s for dinner.

As the close of another decade approaches, we all have to accept that the future is coming. Flash drives are the new floppy disks, jeggings are the new skinny jeans, green is the new crimson. But there are certain changes I refuse to accept: bikes are not the new legs, and cycling is not the new cool thing to do.
I know that Harvard kids have really seized on the idea of bicycling as a legitimate life choice. The thought process makes a lot of sense if you are unathletic in physique and unlikeable in personality. You can barely handle the physical strain of sailing, but you still want to be seen as athletic and healthy. The average person would just go to the gym, lunging off the treadmill for a water break after a breathless half-mile trot and accepting their own lameness. They would deal with the shame and slowly build up their endurance. But Harvard kids are way more entitled than that; Ivy League “exercise” should be as ostentatious and effortless as possible. And what is the most obnoxious and obvious form of public “exercise” available to college students?
Biking.
It’s really a win-win situation: you get to ride your bike everywhere, thereby being about six times lazier than every other student on campus, and you get to pass that laziness off as athleticism. And environmentalism. How boss.
And biking doesn’t just come with PR benefits. It’s really an overall lifestyle improvement. Instead of leaving for class 10 minutes early, you get to leave for class 10 minutes early. Sounds the same, you say? Wrong. Cyclists get to spend three of those ten minutes locking up a bike. You spend those three minutes chatting with your friends on the way to class. I think it’s pretty obvious who has it better: locks can last over 150 years; people are lucky if they make it to 85. Whom would you rather spend at least 15 minutes a week with? Who is more likely to get you through the Mayan apocalypse?
But not all of the cyclist’s new friends are metal. When a mere pedestrian walks through campus, he or she is rarely noticed or shouted at. Heck, you’re lucky to get a wave and a “Hey.” If you barrel through Tercentenary Theater on a bike, though, every single kid on the way to Sever notices and shouts at you. You’re a celebrity. “That douche who runs down children and cripples with his bike every morning.” People remember a man with that sort of a title.
You also get to walk the exciting line between pedestrian and vehicle, never quite sure which one you’re going to act like in this situation. It’s like playing Russian roulette, but with other people’s lives at risk instead of your own. And the best part about confusing everyone near you and endangering everything around you? You get to be entitled about it. If any truck or car threatens your fun with traffic “laws,” buy a “Share the Road” bumper sticker, and slap it on your bike. It is your right as an American to zig-zag between three lanes of 40-mile-per-hour traffic and the sidewalk, and any pedestrian or car in your way had best learn to share. You have important places to be; that’s why you’re biking instead of walking. You are an important person; that’s why you’re biking instead of taking the bus.
In short, being a bicyclist means being the single douchiest biped in a 50-foot radius—machine or mammal—and getting to feel good about yourself because of it. And that is why, cry though we might about how cold it’s about to get, winter in New England brings one awesome gift: way fewer cyclists. So I’ll happily wear 16 layers and sleep under 24 blankets at night if it means that 16 cyclists start taking the bus and 24 break their legs while zig-zagging across the ice.

Rachel L. Wagley ‘11 arrived on Harvard’s campus excited about the prospect of conveying her conservative convictions to a college whose main connection to Red State America is its Crimson hue.
After attending a high school with no debate team or organized political student groups, Wagley was eager for lively intellectual discourse with classmates.
“Students at Harvard are so intelligent and willing to listen, but they don’t often hear the conservative side of the political spectrum represented,” says Wagley. “I feel it’s important that conservatives speak up because if the majority drowns out the minority, that entirely defeats the University’s purpose to promote intellectual and rational discussion.”
Luckily, Wagley relishes chances for debate.
“I thrive here because, as a conservative, there are so many opportunities to find pathways to express your ideologies, which really sharpens you,” she says.
Last year, Wagley took the helm of True Love Revolution (TLR), a non-political student organization that promotes abstinence before marriage. She has since become a fearless voice of opposition to the hook-up culture on campus.
“She doesn’t promote this by being a prude, but rather with sweet reason,” says Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ‘53 who was especially impressed with Wagley after hearing her speak at a TLR event. “She is not all peaches and cream.  She can make a sharp point.”
But Wagley does more than explain the philosophical framework for her conservative social ideology.
“She really lives out the life that she defends, in the hopes that people will see the benefits of it,” says Luciana E. Milano ‘14, who was inspired by Wagley to join TLR.
Even those who do not share her conservative ideology cannot help but respect her commitment.
“I don’t agree with her on everything, but I admire that she is so willing to throw herself out there,” says friend Collin A. Jones ‘12.
Though rebutting leftist sentiments may seem like a demoralizing endeavor in the overwhelmingly liberal climate, Rachel has only been invigorated by her experience at Harvard.
“My goal is always to explain and make people understand why I believe what I believe, which is not to say everyone needs to think what I think, “ she says. “Then I wouldn’t have anyone to debate!”

On a campus where people are sometimes accused of taking life too seriously, Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11—the Immediate Gratification Players’ president, or “czar,” and a writer for the Lampoon—makes it his mission to keep everyone laughing.
Levin-Gesundeit’s interest in comedy dates back to his high school years, when he began writing a humor column dubbed “A Little Levity.” But he did not begin taking improv seriously until he arrived at Harvard and tried out for the IGP. “Getting into the IGP was life-changing for me,” says Levin-Gesundheit. “It’s really my on-campus family.”
Levin-Gesundheit has worked tirelessly as czar of the IGP. He was the driving force behind the creation of an IGP alumni weekend, a J-Term trip to Chicago, and the recently published IGP how-to guide, “So You Think You’re Funny: A Students’ Guide to Improv Comedy.” “I’m constantly impressed by the stuff he does,” says IGP member and Lampoon writer Ben W.K. Smith ’12. “All the credit in the world goes to Scott on the book. He wrote the cover letter, sent it to publishers and agents, edited the whole thing. He went above and beyond.”
Levin-Gesundheit is known for his leadership and energy. “He’s an energetic, spontaneous, caring guy who gets stuff done,” says Smith.
“Scott’s a double threat,” says Graham H. Lazar ’12, another IGP member. “He’s a quirky, funny, fantastic writer, very creative, but he also has a freakish work ethic.” Indeed, Levin-Gesundheit combines a knack for comedic timing with an innate business savvy. En route to a national comedy festival with the IGP, he convinced a restaurant in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. by phone to sponsor the group for their next performance while simultaneously driving the van.
Levin-Gesundheit is also a Peer Advising Fellow, a member of the Crimson Key Society, and an Ec 10 Unit Test grader. He does not, however, feel overextended. “If you manage your time well, you can do a lot here,” he reflects. Sometimes all it takes is a little improv.

In eighth grade, when most students were still struggling to solve for x, Dmitry “Mitka” Vaintrob ’11 was taking college-level calculus at the University of Oregon. By high school, he had moved on to graduate-level courses. And at 18, he was awarded $150,000 in Intel and Siemens prizes for his investigation of string topology.
Today, Vaintrob conducts research in number theory with Professor Barry C. Mazur. “Harvard is blessed with undergraduate math majors who are the best in the world,” says Mazur. “But even here, Dmitry stands out as someone who speaks the language of mathematics as if it were his native tongue. It seems effortless for him.”
When asked why he loves math, Vaintrob replies, “It’s beautiful.” Though many people wouldn’t think of describing math as an artistic endeavor, Vaintrob explained that there is an aesthetic component. “When I’m doing math, I sometimes feel like I’m a writer,” he adds.
Although Vaintrob is leagues ahead of his peers in abstract mathematical concepts, he admits that there are occasional gaps in his mathematical knowledge. When it comes to applying certain techniques, for example, he does make mistakes.
“For physics, he was really good at coming up with tricks to do stuff,” recalls Francois W. Greer ’11, a friend who took Physics 153 with Vaintrob freshman year. “But when it came to actually calculating derivatives, he was not so good, because he learned that stuff in fourth grade or something.”
“I’m always struck because he has a very intuitive, visual approach to math,” says Greer. “It’s easy to get bogged down by details and calculations, but whenever you ask him something, he always reduces it to something visual.”
“Mitka is very, very, very smart, but totally hilarious because he’s off in his own universe sometimes,” said Charlene C. Wang ’11, a friend of Vaintrob’s. “Everyone loves him.”

On the afternoon of Harvard’s glorious victory over Yale, Baltazar ‘Zar’ A. Zavala ’11 opened up a text message informing him that he had received a Rhodes Scholarship. Very soon, Zavala became a fixture in the local and national press, catapulted to the status of mini-celebrity.
What the press coverage doesn’t reveal: According to Meaghan E. Glisczinski ’11, one of Zavala’s best friends, the 6’1’’, 195-pound wide receiver has a flair for “girly” drinks when he goes out, and confesses to once being scared to death by a headless rat in his science lab.
Zavala moved from Mexico to El Paso, Texas, at the age of four, and says he knew that he wanted to go to Harvard a year later. An Emmitt Smith fan and cartoon aficionado, Zavala wanted to be a champion of some sort when he grew up and was told that the only way to achieve that was to attend Harvard. The precocious toddler, raised as a single child by his mother, never let go of that dream.
At Harvard, Zavala is a model student and tenacious athlete. The joint concentrator in engineering and neurobiology maintains a 3.92 GPA and was recently elected to the academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa. During his first year at the College, Zavala walked on to the football team and revelled in the camaraderie, so much so that he gladly accepted giving up 30 hours a week to rigorous training routines.
“What I like most about him is that he has a great sense of humor and is just really goofy and light-hearted,” said Glisczinski.
“Committed” is another trait that defines Zavala, be it with respect to p-sets, football, or love. He met his fiancée, Melanie Johns, as a freshman in high school, and the two soon became a couple.
“My senior year in high school, I went up to accept a big award in front of the whole student population,” he says. “On the podium I took out a promise ring and told Melanie that no matter what happened or where we were, we would stay together through college.” Zavala kept his word and on their seventh anniversary next June, the couple will tie the knot.
At Oxford with his future wife by his side, Zavala plans to pursue a M.Sc. in neuroscience and clinical neurology. He says he hopes to eventually become a neurosurgeon. However, Yves R. Chretien, a lecturer in the Department of Statistics who spent the summer of 2009 in China with Zavala, has different plans in mind for the Rhodes scholar.
“He’s a natural leader,” Chretien says. “In 15 years, he’d make a reasonable president of Harvard.”

Although the approaching holidays may be overshadowed by the universal downer that is final exams, many Harvard students still find themselves celebrating in style with Secret Santa gift exchanges. But if you happen to draw the name of Someone You Don’t Really Know, the search for the perfect gag gift could turn from a fun study distraction to an annoying challenge. In case you’re stumped, FM has drawn up a cheat sheet based on your relationship to the Secret Santee to make your shopping go more smoothly.
Freshman Entryway
Most freshmen fall back on their entryways for socialization, so if you don’t know the person you’re matched up with, odds are it’s because he or she never leaves their room. Get them a Grow-Your-Own friend/male stripper/pet flamingo (around $3 at Hidden Sweets) so that they’ll have a project and some company during all those lonely hours.
Annenberg Table
There’s some serious awkward potential in these groups, especially if there’s that one kid who shows up every single time uninvited and never fully introduces himself. We suggest maxing out your spending limit for a gift certificate to the Kong (or Boloco, or any other Square restaurant), which will give him a reason to eat someplace else for once.
Roommate’s Significant Other
This is the one who moved their name tag to your door and never seems to spend the night elsewhere. If they’ve earned the honor of being an extra “roommate” for the purpose of the gift exchange, buy them a bar of soap ($2.99 at CVS) so they stop using yours and save the rest of your budget to get yourself some earplugs.
Section or Lab Classmate
Yes, most people in your class are probably just as jaded as you are with regards to learning, but you don’t have to acknowledge your awareness of that. Head to a bookstore and pick up an inexpensive volume related to the class subject that they “just can’t miss.” Or wrap up all of your lecture notes and give them the gift of an easier reading period.
Student Organization Member
Buy them alcohol. We all know that drinking is the real purpose behind most student groups.

Although the daylight hours are growing increasingly short and the stress of exams draws ever nearer, the holiday season and all of its delicious treats are also just around the corner. To celebrate, FM has compiled holiday drink recipes with the help of a few Harvard faculty members to encourage everyone to take a break for some seasonal festivities.
1. Prerna Singh, Assistant Professor of Government recommends hot buttered rum: “It’s easy to make and really warming.”
Directions:
In a bowl, cream together butter, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Refrigerate until almost firm. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture into 12 small mugs. Pour about 3 ounces of rum into each mug (filling about halfway). Top with boiling water, stir well (a cinnamon stick adds flavor and panache), and serve immediately.
2. Gregory Tucci, Co-Director of Undergraduate Studies and Senior Lecturer on Chemistry, recommends mulled cider. “There was not one molecule of the cider left over,” he says of the last time he served this specialty. “It smells and tastes delicious.”
Ingredients:
1 gallon apple cider
20 bags Martinelli’s Gold Medal Mulling Spices
3. R.J. Jenkins, resident tutor in Lowell House and head TF of English 154: “Literature and Sexuality,” recommends Godiva Dark Chocolate Peppermintini.
Ingredients:
Melted Godiva Dark Chocolate cut gently with warm milk to desired consistency
A generous splash of Peppermint Schnapps
Serve piping hot in a warm martini glass with a candy cane on the rim

Johnny F. Bowman, Jr. ’11 has worn many hats.
“He’s able to seamlessly transition between parts of Harvard that we think are very isolated,” says Eric N. Hysen ’11, current Undergraduate Council Vice President, describing Bowman’s diverse roles as UC President, labor activist, and member of the Spee.
Bowman’s path to the presidency was fairly unconventional; he joined the UC only last fall, the same semester he campaigned for president. But he brought his personality to the position with one of the first e-mails he sent out; a (poorly) Photoshopped version of Hysen and his campaign photo with the duo wearing “Happy New Year” hats.
Humor has been the connecting thread through the many facets of Bowman’s life. Both his parents wrote for Saturday Night Live and his first dream was to be a comedy writer.
That all changed during his early years of college. First, his family was caught up in the 2007-2008 Writers’ Strike. Then he spent a semester of his gap year living with an impoverished family in Guatemala. “He came back changed,” says his father, John F. Bowman Sr. ’80. An internship with a labor union in Los Angeles was the final push; he returned to campus his sophomore year ready to dedicate himself to labor advocacy.
But, says Bowman Jr., “Labor activism is tough; you yell and scream and march around a lot. I realized it would make my life easier if I just became president of the UC.”
Despite his new path, Bowman has not left comedy entirely behind. He says his idol is his roommate, Tyler G. Hall ’11 because, “He’s the funniest person I know.”
Hall offers another reason, “Johnny’s always wanted to be as tall as I am.”
Bowman’s mother, Shannon C. Gaughan Bowman ’81 also highlighted her son’s “extreme compassion,” describing Bowman’s attentive and patient care during her final, difficult pregnancy. It was his humor, she says, that helped her to relax and pull through.
“That’s the most important skill to have in life,” she says. “I feel like, at the end of the day, a sense of humor is what keeps us sane.”

Whenever Marco Chan ’11 writes a humanities paper, he usually ends up arguing the same concept: a common ground. “Part of it is my own inclination for bringing ideas and bringing people together,” he explains. As co-chair of the Queer Students and Allies and tour manager for the Harvard Glee Club, Chan is characterized by his ability to connect with students across campus.
Born in Hong Kong, Chan has also lived in Macau, Montreal, and Vancouver, and he speaks six languages. He says that his diverse background has proven to be a strength: “I’m always different in some way wherever I am, but that makes me that much more aware of the consistencies from place to place,” he says.
Chan is perhaps best known for his heavy involvement with QSA. After offering his contributions to the group before he was a freshman, he was named co-chair his sophomore year. But his peers see him as a leader beyond this role. “Marco is really good at responding to people who have problems,” says close friend Alex E. H. McNaughton ’11. “He’s very in touch with different parts of the queer community.”
Throughout his tenure with QSA, Chan has made internal unification a priority. “People in LGBT are in many different communities and people from many different communities are in LGBT,” he says. “We are trying to capture all the different interests that people have that make up this community.”
His ability to empathize with others also extends to promoting tolerance throughout the greater Harvard community. “You’re always someone else’s ‘weird.’ And everyone has their own story,” he explains. “The best thing we can do is to step into someone else’s shoes and start walking on common ground, because that is where we are most likely to move forward.”
“It’s very rare to cross paths with a person who is as genuinely passionate about making the world a better place as Marco,” writes Alice Y. Mai, a friend of Chan’s from high school, in an e-mail to The Crimson. “Marco is the most inspirational person I’ve ever known.”

Olivia “Liv” F. Coffey ’11, known for her huge smile and rowing prowess, always has the perfect words of encouragement for the Radliffe heavyweight crew team. At Harvard, Coffey has been a prominent fixture in the top women’s heavyweight boat since her freshman year, putting aside her uncertainties and using her substantial experience to try for the Olympic team. “I’m not sure if I can make the national team, the training will be really tough,” says Coffey humbly.
Also indications of Coffey’s promising rowing future are her accomplishments outside of Harvard. Her boat placed second at the 2009 Under-23 World Championships and won gold at the same race in 2010, when she was in the bow seat—making her the first across the finish line.
“You think as soon as it happens you will be thrilled, but the race is too exhausting,” says Coffey. “Later, it felt pretty incredible.”
Coffey’s genetics also forecast her rowing success. Her father, a 1976 Olympic silver medalist for rowing, and her mother, also a former elite rower, never pressured her to row. “It was always just assumed,” Liv says. “I idolize my parents...that contributed to it.”
Rachel E. Rauh ’11, co-captain of the women’s heavyweight team and Coffey’s high school classmate, says, “Liv is a natural leader, both on and off the water. Everyone on the team sees her as a role model.”
In addition to her team spirit, Coffey is also a dedicated economics concentrator with a secondary in computer science. “To finish college without learning anything about computer science is to do a huge disservice to yourself,” Coffey says. She aspires to one day become an avid iPhone application creator. However, it may be a while before iPhone users benefit from Coffey’s apps, as she intends to try out for the 2012 US Olympic Team after graduation.
Although iPhone app design and business school remain her long-term goals, Coffey’s current focus is the Olympics. “2016 is long away, but if I enjoy training for 2012, I can see myself sticking with it,” says Coffey. “Who knows, maybe I’ll even try for 2020 at the ripe old age of 31.”

Stephanie M. Cole ’11 is an avid scrapbooker. She has kept every ticket stub and postcard she has received since middle school. Cole’s scrapbook contains the normal fare—Harvard-Yale ticket, family vacation mementos—but then there’s also the boarding pass from Malawi after sophomore year, where she weighed malnourished babies in clinical trials, and airline tickets from Mali last summer, where she spearheaded the creation of a new clinic for malnourished children.
Leading both the Keylatch afterschool program and the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, Cole has dedicated her extracurricular life at Harvard to service. And outside of Harvard, she has traveled the past two summers to Africa with Project Peanut Butter, a nonprofit that combats malnourishment in children. After graduation, she will return to Mali to direct a new Project Peanut Butter outpost.
“A lot of people at Harvard talk about changing things, but Stephanie has taken proactive steps to enact change,” says Luci Yang ’11, her roommate since sophomore year.
The organismic and evolutionary biology concentrator spent last summer in Mali, navigating the diverse challenges of getting Project Peanut Butter set up to run there. “We had to meet with UNICEF and the people from [the] Ministry of Health,” she explains. “It took a lot of hanging out with the police and a lot of bureaucracy.”
Living alone in Mali was an adjustment for Cole. “You do get a lot of attention as a white female,” she says. “And day to day, the main difference is not having personal space,” Cole adds. “People just come up to you. And the heat. I was there in the ‘cold season,’ and it was 90 degrees every day.”
But it was a place she ultimately came to love. “At first, I thought it would be a very different culture,” she says. “I wasn’t sure what was culturally appropriate, but when I got there everyone was friendly and excited.”
Further afield, Cole hopes to go to medical school and return to Africa to practice. “She has a sort of mantra that she often says,” explains Jacintha G. Tagal ’11, her HRCF co-leader: “To live simply, so that others can simply live.”

Math 23 is aiming to go global. Motivated by the chance to create what is likely the first proof-based math class online, lecturer Paul G. Bamberg ’63 organized a meeting last week with Harvard Extension School representatives and students from his course to discuss possibilities for distance-learning. Preliminary tests for an entirely online version of Math 23b will begin in the spring. Efforts to digitize Math 23 are part of an ongoing distance-learning movement in several universities, including Harvard. Distance education aims to provide access to lecture videos so students can take courses regardless of geographic or time constraints, with some courses even being offered for free online.
E-PROOFS?
Distance education had its humble beginnings in the 1800s in the form of correspondence courses that took place via mail. After the advent of radio and television in the early to mid-20th century, some universities tried to create distance-learning courses that could be taken for credit. These endeavors never caught on, however, and were ultimately unsuccessful.
Digital video recording and the Internet have, in recent years, provided yet another avenue for distance education, one that may be more promising than previous experiments. Online courses can be accessed anywhere and at any time, and also allow for the possibility of collaboration with instructors and other students through video-conference technology.
For about 12 years, the Harvard Extension School has been offering an online option for some of its courses so that students geographically distant from Harvard can still enroll in classes. Over 150 of the Harvard Extension School’s approximately 680 courses are currently available online. Math 23 could be the newest addition to the list.
“I had first thought that this would not work for Math 23, since a key feature of the course was presenting proofs to other students,” says Bamberg. He changed his mind a few weeks ago, when he started allowing students to turn in proofs in a video format instead of the traditional PDF. “These videos consist mainly of people writing out equations for proofs on paper or whiteboard while explaining their solution,” says Bamberg.
Terrence B. McKenna ’14 was one of the early adopters of the proof video. He says that proofs are much easier to understand in video form, since the proof presenters must thoroughly explain all the intricacies involved in each step.  “In the video you really have to know your stuff,” agrees Irene Y. Chen ’14. “It really demonstrates ability instead of just writing down the proof.”
In the spring, Bamberg hopes to have an Extension School Math 23b section that meets solely through video conference. Students would present proofs in video format and would not need to come to class at all. This system could allow students from around the world to enroll in Math 23 under the Harvard Extension School.
But the class itself depends on collaboration through student study groups, cooperation on problem sets, and “proof parties” accompanied by food and drink. Could this all be replicated online?
“You can’t really have an online proof party, and you especially can’t do it with refreshments,” says Bamberg. Even lecture videos might be insufficient, according to Bamberg, since the general view among faculty is that a video is no substitute for a live lecture. Students seem to agree. “I think you’re more engaged in person,” says Kyle S. Solan ’14, a student in Computer Science 50, which has video lectures. “It’s more immersive than sitting there watching the lecture on your computer.”
Regardless of the difficulties they may face, Bamberg and the Extension School will begin testing the distance-learning delivery of Math 23b in January. “You never really know what’s going to happen,” says Bamberg. “But it’s worth giving a try.”
A PEEK INTO THE IVORY TOWER
Another movement at the Harvard Extension School is the Open Learning Initiative, which currently features just eight classes with topics ranging from Chinese history to abstract algebra.
Several elite universities, including MIT, Stanford, and Yale, feature websites that grant free access to course materials and lecture videos. According to Dr. Henry H. Leitner, the Chief Technology Officer at Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education, many Harvard faculty are interested in getting courses out to the world, but some political decisions from the university administration still need to be made.
Classes that use significant amounts of third-party materials cannot be made available online to the general public since they may violate the doctrine of “fair use” granted by copyright laws. Under the Teach Act, professors can show their in-class students almost any third-party content they like. When those lectures are disseminated to the others, however, the Teach Act no longer applies. Issues such as these, Leitner says, are frustrating but important to deal with.
“It’s a little early to predict where this’ll go,” says Leitner. He is hopeful that more classes will continue being added to the Open Learning Initiative, but its future will likely remain unclear for at least a few more months.
The twin efforts to expand Harvard’s educational opportunities to Extension School students and to the public at large are ongoing and incomplete, but they reveal an important contemporary trend towards more open education in general. So the next time a big lecture class starts getting boring, look around for a video camera—someone across the world might be watching.

With the end of the semester fast approaching, most students are looking forward to a relaxing winter vacation before another term begins, but a small contingent on campus is anticipating more. Fall graduates, or “super seniors” as they are commonly known, have spent at least one extra term on campus, and will be receiving their diplomas in a matter of weeks.
Though the common path of a Harvard student consists of four continuous years of classes, some students take time off during their studies and have to stay behind after their class graduates. Sometimes, these breaks are unexpected. Ryan R. Burkhead ’10-11 injured his foot last fall playing varsity football and took the spring semester off after enduring the season-ending surgery. “Sports are brutal. People get hurt all the time,” says Burkhead, adding that it’s common for football players to stay on for an extra season after an injury.
Other fall graduates needed an extra semester for academic reasons. Isaac S. Shivvers ’10-11, an astrophysics concentrator did not initially plan on a late graduation. He decided to take sophomore spring off to travel the country with his band Moniker. “It was a chance to do something we had always talked about,” he says. He didn’t anticipate his impending super senior status because he had arrived at Harvard with advanced standing. It was only after switching concentrations before his senior fall that he realized that he would be staying at Harvard for the fall of 2010.
Sion Lee ’10-11 spent a semester abroad in Ecuador, living in an indigenous community and studying the practice of vertical birth. During her stay she was influenced by the Andean emphasis on family life, and decided to spend another semester away from Harvard reconnecting with her own family. “My parents thought taking time off was a sign of weakness, but they eventually understood my decision,” Sion says.
NAVIGATING THE SOCIAL SCENE
Staying on campus after all of their class has graduated, however, can be disconcerting for the fall graduates, especially in terms of the Harvard social scene. “It was weird at the beginning of the semester. Going to the dining hall you feel like that awkward kid in high school who doesn’t know anybody. You really have to force yourself to meet new people,” says Burkhead. Robert E.T. Tainsh ’10-11, who took time off after an unfocused freshman fall, found the atmosphere this year more conducive to studying. “I believe with my crazy blocking group gone, my GPA is the highest it’s ever been,” he says.
Beyond academics, Harvard nightlife also changes for a super senior. “It can get a bit awkward. When I go to a final club and introduce myself to a girl, and it turns out that she was born in 1992, I’m just like ‘Oh no,’” says Burkhead.
Shivvers remains involved in the Harvard social scene through his music. His new band Third Rail, which hopes to replace DJs at campus parties, has played at venues from the Owl Club to this year’s Harvard-Yale pep rally in the Yard. “It’s sort of sad leaving now. I think the band could be big for the next few years,” he says. “But I’ve selected an heir to my throne.”
MOVING ON
As they approach their long-awaited graduation, fall graduates are making plans for their future after an extended stay at Harvard. Tainsh hopes to find a career in public service. Burkhead plans to spend his spring playing football in Spain before attending law school next fall. Lee will travel with her family, maybe go on a mission trip, and then head to medical school. Shivvers plans to spend some time in Hong Kong and then possibly work at an observatory in Chile before going to graduate school for astrophysics. His musical future will be put on hold for now. “I want to be in an old man bar band for the rest of my life, but a career in music is not what I’m looking for.” says Shivvers.
Despite graduating off-cycle, most super seniors don’t regret the decisions they made.  They value the opportunity they had to reflect. “I was too immature for college when I got here,” says Tainsh. “I don’t at all regret taking time to re-evaluate.”
“I would definitely recommend it—I’ve enjoyed college as much this semester as I ever have,” says Burkhead. Especially as a pre-med student, Lee found her time off extremely rewarding. “When I got back to Harvard, I kept on seeing people who were jaded, exhausted, and ready to get out,” she says. “I came back finally ready to embrace what Harvard had to offer with a new set of eyes and a laid-back perspective.”

“Karla’s ability to juggle so many classes and writerly pursuits is mysterious. Maybe she’s a spy,” says George H. Blaustein, concentration advisor to Karla M. Cornejo Villavicencio ’11, a senior in Pfoho who has found success in the literary world outside Harvard. Though her spy status remains uncertain, her skill with words is not. Cornejo has been a research assistant for Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker, an adjunct scholar at Lapham’s Quarterly, and a contributing writer for Interview Magazine and The Atlantic online. She says the highlight of her literary internship at Harper’s Magazine two summers ago was investigating the whereabouts of Pablo Escobar’s missing hippo.
Cornejo’s adventures with writing began when she was 15 and discovered she could get into shows for free if she wrote about them. The editor of a jazz monthly called “All About Jazz” recruited her to write album reviews after finding her in a music writing class. “I told him I didn’t know anything about jazz and I didn’t particularly like it,” she says. “He told me I could write, and once you can write, you can write about anything.”
Born in Ecuador, Cornejo has also merged her passion for writing and her love of Latin American literature by translating works from Spanish to English. Recently, Harper’s published her translation of an interview with Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.
In between music writing and translations, Cornejo finds time to be “an ideal History and Literature student,” according to Blaustein, who is a Hist and Lit lecturer. “Karla’s scholarship is both pious and profane, and she has impeccable taste,” he says.
For now, Cornejo does not consider music writing her career goal. “I think good writing is the opposite of silence, and that’s what I want to keep doing,” she says. “I write because I’m emotionally, temperamentally, intellectually incapable of doing anything else—maybe my life would be different if I knew how to factor binomials.”

Some friends of Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11 joke that he is the most patriotic guy they know. He is a talented banjo player who is committed to learning the national folk songs of the American Left—and when he plays them at home in the Dudley Co-op, of which he is a co-president, the whole community gathers around to join in.
But Forbes has found his politics to be far more controversial than his music. Born in Jamaica and raised in New York City, he earned himself a place at  Phillips Exeter Academy. During his senior year there, after serving as president of the Exeter Socialist Club, he founded an anarchist magazine that substituted antiwar slogans for advertisements.
The visual and environmental studies concentrator has been active in the Student Labor Action Movement since 2008, when it was galvanized to defend the interests of the University’s employees in the light of budget cuts. Since last spring, he has been director of SLAM and provided graphic designs for protest material. One design, a Harvard crest altered so that the three open books read “AV-AR-ICE,” scored a mention in Vanity Fair.
But it was with the Student Immigration Movement that Forbes’ most illustrious moment would come. The DREAM Act campaign needed a logo for one of their projects. Volunteered by a few friends, Forbes sent the product of a few flurried hours on his laptop and by the next day, it had been accepted by the national United We Dream office as the official DREAM University design. “It just took off in a way I never really imagined,” Forbes says.
He hopes to earn a Masters of Fine Arts in graphic design and cannot imagine anything but combining this artistic passion with his activism. “That stuff doesn’t die,” he says.
His friend and housemate Colette S. Perold ’11 agrees that Forbes is not the kind to ever stop trying to change the world. “There’s a spark that just wants to question everything and bring life to everything,” she explains.
“He might want you to think he’s grumpy,” Perold says. “But he really does have a massive heart.”

Sherry Gong ’11 is brilliant with numbers. She is, after all, headed to New Orleans this January to receive the Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize, awarded annually to the number one female math student in the country.
The daughter of two math professors, Gong remembers falling in love with math at a young age. Later, when she embraced physics, she would become absorbed with the beautiful precision of equations.
“You could make things simpler, but that’s not really the point,” says Gong. “You would see what’s quintessential—the essential part of the situation.”
Essential to Gong’s own background is a diversity of experience that has led to her unique intellectual approach. Born in New York, Sherry grew up in Toronto, Puerto Rico and New Hampshire. Math competitions have taken her to Singapore, Vietnam, and Mexico.
As a freshman, Gong scored over 100 in Harvard’s famous problem solving course, Math 55, which required perfect scores on all assignments, tests, bonus problems, and the final exam. The class directed her to the abstract math included in her joint mathematics and physics thesis. 
“The area of math I do is very much an ‘art’s for art’s sake’ sort of thing,” explains Gong.
When asked what differentiates her from other students in her field, Pavel I. Etingof, a mathematics professor at MIT who worked with Gong during summer 2009, states simply, “She’s better than most of them.” 
According to Etingof, “She has a really intellectual approach in the sense that she values knowledge, not scoring some point.”
Alexander T. Hristov ’11, a friend of Gong’s, describes her unique ability to transfer her desire for truth to those around her.
Hristov compares Gong’s effect to the work required of an eight-page proof, in which an assumption on Page four may slip under the radar or pass the grader’s eyes. 
“Sherry unpacks that [assumption] and says this one sentence you’ve stated or assumed is either wrong or requires another 10 pages of work, and she’ll do that other 10 pages of work because she thinks it matters,” says Hristov.
So go intellectual discussions with Gong, which often extend to the early hours of the morning. 
“If you have an idea and you’re talking to her about that idea she’ll ask you to do the equivalent thing,” says Hristov. “To substantiate that one sentence of Page four of eight in that hardwiring of your brain.”

Ice hockey may be the national pastime where he comes from, but Ricky D. Kuperman '11—a native of Toronto, Canada—was captivated by dance from a young age. “I was six or seven, and I certainly wasn’t a big kid,” says Kuperman. “My mom was worried I’d get beat up in the rink, so she threw me into dance class.” Since then, the multi-talented Kuperman has choreographed and performed numerous dances, participating in national competitions and appearing in the MTV dance film titled “Turn the Beat Around.”
Kuperman is best known across campus for his choreography and his work with the Harvard Ballet Company. In the Company’s Fall 2009 Loeb Mainstage Production, “Momentum!” Kuperman choreographed a dance titled “To Dust,” which he performed with Elizabeth C. Walker ’11. The piece was so well received that it was subsequently selected to represent Harvard at the American College Dance Festival, featuring entries from around the country.
Last summer Kuperman and his brother, Jeffrey D. Kuperman, directed their own dance film, “In a Moment,” which is expected to premiere in the next few months. The film intertwines dance and theater, and its art-house feel sets it apart from the likes of “Step Up.”
In addition to his extensive work in the arts, Kuperman, a psychology concentrator, has done research with the Health and Psychophysiology Laboratory and Moral Cognition Laboratory. “I was impressed by the quality of work Ricky was creating as a research assistant,” says Amitai Shenhav, a Ph.D candidate in psychology, who has worked closely with Kuperman. “He has a very ambitious spirit.”
Kuperman, armed with a wide array of abilities, is not sure what the future holds for him. “I’m interested in the human condition, and telling a compelling story,” he says.
“He’s definitely pursuing his passion, and I don’t think that is going to change,” says roommate Vishal Lugani ’11. “Whatever he may be doing in the future, he’s going to do an amazing job, because he’ll live and breathe it everyday. I’m excited to see what happens.”

9:53 p.m.
After an hour on Facebook, you’ve finally packed your laptop, overdue books, and Vitamin Water. Lamont Café awaits you.
10:49 p.m.
It’s been nearly an hour, and things haven’t been too bad. Besides the four times you checked your Gmail and realized no one loves you, you’ve read through the prompt for your paper and you’ve started your outline. Good job!
11:41 p.m.
Oh look—it’s been almost two hours and, no, you haven’t really started yet. At least you’ve written “Introduction” at the top of your outline.
12:18 a.m.
The guy behind you is having a loud conversation with a girl you recognize from your Expos class. Maybe a trip to the Café counter and a cup of black coffee might help you focus. Doesn’t matter if you drink coffee or not; just spend the two bucks.
1:04 a.m.
At this point, you’re so jittery that you begin to contemplate some of the bigger questions in life, like: “Why did I decide to take this English Gen Ed?” Or: “Why did I choose Harvard?” You might even start to ask yourself, “Is this real life?” Don’t panic. Just head to the vending machine with $3.00 in hand to pick up a 5-hour Energy drink.
3:20 a.m.
Why is that guy still talking so loudly? Anyhow, you are now successfully on the sixth of ten pages. You’ve begun to identify the penguin in the novel as a symbol of socialism in European governments. Your left eyelid has developed a habit of shutting on its own every two minutes.
5:39 a.m.
This is the point of the night where I Saw You Harvard, Harvard FML, Facebook and Gmail finally cease to excite you. Your delirium has condensed into giddiness, and you’re getting high off writing your footnotes. You might not be able to feel your face, but your TF will adore the look of your “Sources” page. You’re on Page eight.
6:41 a.m.
Now that the sun has risen, your bathroom-visit count is up to seven.
7:18 a.m.
Page 10. It’s done. Your paper is finally done. You look up the shuttle schedule to find when the next shuttle to the Quad is so you can shower and change and be a human being.
11:48 a.m.
You wake up from the nap you didn’t plan to take. Your paper was due in class at 10 a.m. Better luck next time...

Attend an event hosted by one of Harvard’s House Masters, and an inquiry as to who prepared the food will return a curious answer: “The Elves did.” However, these elves are not mythical creatures, or even a joke—they are, in fact, graduate students, professionals, and former undergraduates of average height who assist the House Masters in return for room and board.
Prospective Elves learn of the position mostly through word of mouth. Those who get the job then organize, run, and clean up after House functions, from open houses to dinner receptions, they meticulously pound out the details. Although the general mission for House Elves is to help their House Masters, the tasks differ among the different Houses. Whereas Currier’s Elves usually are left to coordinate, the Quincy Elves, who cook and bake, are a “go-to catering service,” according to Sean C. Robinson ’09, a current Quincy House Elf. Despite the number of responsibilities, Elves do have the privilege of participating in House Life outside of the undergraduate years. “It gives me a little community, makes you feel like you are part of something contained,” said Sara J. Bookin-Weiner, a Currier Elf.
But due to the Harry Potter series and the elves who work at Hogwarts, this isn’t the image that immediately comes to mind for some when they hear about this unique position. “Enough with the Harvard architecture looking like Harry Potter’s—now there are elves,” Robinson said. “Some students have told stories where they asked if it was okay if they throw socks at us, because they wanted to give us our freedom.”
But what about life when that freedom is finally given? “It makes people pay attention in a job interview when you say you are an elf and you can cook,” said Robinson with a wide grin.  “Believe me.”

In middle school, I privately rejoiced at the miles of highway that stood between me and church. Every Sunday, my family would drive for two hours up the spine of New Jersey to make it in time for the weekly service—a certain inconvenience for all other parties involved but me. I wanted to be as far away as possible from that old stone building; I hated its ancient musk, the creepy pictorial interpretations of the Beatitudes on the wall, and the constant singing that wafted Gregorian-style from the adult choir room.
My feelings for church were validated by the sheer horror I often felt as I stared at the green-shuttered rectory that stood right by the building. How anyone—even the reverend—could choose to sleep, shower, and do laundry 50 feet away from that place and its ubiquitous chanting was beyond my comprehension. Nine years later, this past February, I was informed that my family would be moving into the rectory immediately. Yes, that one.
Since sixth grade, not only had my family returned to that old stone church, but my dad had been educated and ordained as a pastor. I am what you would call a “PK,” short for “Pastor’s Kid.” If you visit Korean grocery stores throughout northern New Jersey, you will find CDs of my dad’s sermons available for your listening pleasure. (My mom likes to blast them in the car, and it always makes me feel as though my dad is yelling at me.)
I find that there’s a lot of commiseration and shared self-loathing when PKs meet each other. To be sure, I’m quite proud of what my dad does, but it’s a profession that has constantly influenced my own complicated relationship with religion. Most of the adults at my church squeal and coo when they see me, squeezing my cheeks and calling me “blessed” for my close spiritual ties. One man gave me a giant box filled with slabs of red pork with the hopes that I grow nice and big, like some sacred cow. Church and filial duty are two sides of the same coin: with my paltry guitar skills, I have belted out Christian songs in front of deadpan-faced children, and I once chaperoned a trip for them to watch a supremely awkward musical about Adam and Eve.
I won’t bother you with the details, but I should clarify that within my pretty religious family, I am on the much lower end of the spectrum. In high school, I was a bit too pugnacious to be a good PK: I may or may not have made life difficult for one youth pastor whom I deemed unfit to lead our young charges. When I came to Harvard, I found how easy it was to skip church on Sundays—and I grew to dread the Monday phone call from my mom asking if I had gone. My dad would mail me imposing messages, scrawled on unlined paper, about how I should really read the Bible, among other pieces of life advice. Every trip I made back home from college heightened my sense of religious fraudulence as the daughter of a pastor: when people asked me about my religious community up in Boston, I simply stammered and curled my toes (an anxious tic).
So when I first learned that my family would actually be moving into the rectory, life seemed to be laughing in my face. Distance had always been the comforting buffer maintaining the separation between home life and church—a distinction already made tenuous by my dad’s profession. But now I saw how my spring break would really go: I would wake up in some dank wooden chamber of a room lit by candles and decorated with crucifixes, to the discomfiting sound of congregation members either praying or singing down below. Are inhabitants allowed to watch “Jersey Shore” or curse in a rectory? Would there even be Internet?
But in the few times that I have been home since February, I have come to love the rectory. Churchgoers do pop by from time to time, but it has ultimately become a home for my family. I like how I know everyone is home when I hear the washing machine running noisily all day long. I love how before my arrival, my mom carefully preens my yellow bathroom and then stacks my bed with at least five different varieties of sheets so that I often cannot move once I’m pinned underneath.
Even though I can see the church through nearly all the windows, the rectory has—weirdly enough—become less about the church or my identity as a PK, and more about my family. We often say at home that my mom’s two greatest loves in life are church and family—so she just about loses it when my siblings and I come home and go to church together. No matter what religious path I ultimately choose for myself, I can rest assured that our new home has confirmed what I have always valued about religion: its place in my family.
When I go back home in a couple weeks, I know that my mom will ask me to attend early morning service with her at 5 a.m., and I will try my best to oblige. After all, it’s only a jaunt away, and there’s nothing like going home after all these months—even if that means walking hand-in-hand with my mom to that old stone building I used to hate so much.

When asked what he sees himself doing after graduating from Harvard in the spring, Isidore “Izzy” M.T. Bethel ’11 gives an answer that’s hardly typical.
“I do want to be a filmmaker ultimately,” he begins before pausing. “But I’m thinking of going to architecture school.”
For a student who has been making films since the age of 10, labeling Bethel as a filmmaker is a no-brainer. Before he had even started his first year of college, film festivals near and far—from the Atlanta Film Festival of his hometown to Denmark’s Aarhus Festival of Independent Arts—had exhibited Bethel’s work. As an undergraduate, he has taken on the role of director, editor, producer, cinematographer, and even animator in many short films and a full-length film titled “Terminus.”  However, as a concentrator in Visual and Environmental Studies, Bethel says that while half the classes he has taken are in film and video production, the other half have been in architectural theory.
When explaining why he decided to study both subjects, he says, “For me, whenever there is an interface between a human being and that which is not a human being—that is environmental studies.”
Currently, Bethel is working on his senior thesis under the guidance of French filmmaker Dominique Cabrera, whom he met while studying abroad in Paris last spring.
“He’s very witty and hilarious to talk to,” says Oliver D. Strand ’11, Bethel’s close friend and one of the people showcased in his developing thesis project.
However, the project is still a mystery to almost all of the parties involved, except for Cabrera and Bethel himself. But Cabrera thinks such secrecy is something that will give the film clarity, and help Bethel decide what type of projects he wants to do next.
“I am very happy to have met him right now because he is at a point in his life, with this project, where he is making it,” she says, with a light pound of her fist on the table. “His work is very difficult, and yet he is making it.”

Working at the White House this summer, Marshall Scholar P. Kenzie Bok ’11 was busy reading letters from America. It was yet another reinforcement of her strong belief in bringing people and policy together. “In politics, as elsewhere, you have to think about people as people,” she explains. “You really have to think about people as ends in themselves.”
As the student president of the Institute of Politics (IOP), she works to organize people as tools for public change. “We don’t want people who are thinking about politics as a power game for a ruling class,” she says. “We want people to be asking, ‘what are the solutions to the problems that we see around us?’”
Before leading the IOP, Bok served as chair of its Fellows program, which brings in important politicians and policy experts to lead study groups and mentor students at the Institute for a semester. “There are as many paths as people to a career in public service,” she says. “The fellows help students envision what they could end up doing, potential paths they could take.”
As a Peer Advising Fellow, Bok continues to connect people to resources that help them find their calling. According to proctor Sarah Wagner-McCoy, “She is great on giving advice to people and helping to plug them into different activities on campus.”
Jenny Ye ’13, a former advisee of Bok’s, agrees. “She is very interested in getting people excited about public service, even people who are not government concentrators,” she says.
As for Bok’s own path, next year she will study intellectual history and theology at Cambridge University. But studying the history of people as thinkers and the changes they effect will be nothing new for Bok—just people politics as usual.

Before reading period last semester, Charlie Albright ’11 was not only juggling a full course load, but also a full concert schedule. The classical pianist’s daily routine consisted of attending rehearsal, napping before his performances, and returning at night to finish a physics p-set, photograph it, and e-mail it to his TF.
“I guess that’s typical for when I’m away,” he says.
Albright’s musical prowess manifested itself at an early age. Family lore has it that he climbed onto the piano at age 3 and began playing. He played by ear until he was 7, when he began classical music studies with teacher Nancy B. Adsit.
The following year, a local news station featured Albright on a program. “They asked me what I thought the boy would do,” Adsit says of being interviewed. “‘Anything he wants,’ I answered.” To date, Albright has won national and international competitions, including the 2010 Gilmore Young Artist Award and the Young Concert Artist International Piano Auditions first prize in 2009. He has also given three concerts with Yo-Yo Ma ’76.
Currently a pre-med economics concentrator, Albright is also enrolled in Harvard’s dual degree program with the New England Conservatory. “Music was huge in my life, but academics were huge too,” he says of his decision to attend Harvard rather than a conservatory alone.
Albright introduced his talent to the Harvard community early, wowing the audience at the Freshman Talent Show. His winning performance consisted of a medley, starting with Chopin’s Fourth Ballade, moving into “Great Balls of Fire,” and concluding with the end of the Chopin Ballade.
Though Albright performs concerts on a regular basis, his fame hasn’t gone to his head. “I think the thing that sets Charlie apart is that he’s super humble and down to earth,” says Daniel J. Oh ’11, one of Albright’s blockmates.
As for the future, Albright recognizes the difficulties in pursuing music as a career. “I’d also love to be a doctor,” he says, “but I’d love to be a concert pianist more.”

“Friends without benefits”
I’ve begun hanging out a lot with this girl I like, but I think she views me as a friend; sometimes she talks about guys she thinks are cute. What do I do?
—Weeping in Winthrop
Dear Weeping in Winthrop,
GAY BEST FRIEND ALERT. It’s time to get drastic. Play a drinking game with her, like two-person Spin-the-Bottle or Strip War (like Strip Poker, but quicker) to see if the heat turns up. If this fails, try to make her jealous by sitting in her dining hall every day with other girls and laughing really loudly. Also, make sure to look repulsed at the word “penis.”
Best of luck,

“My boyfriend likes my girlfriends!”
I’ve been dating my new boyfriend for two months, and I think he’s great, but I’m worried that he enjoys spending time with my girlfriends a bit too much. It’s getting annoying. Should I be concerned?
—Confused in Cabot
Dear Confused in Cabot,
Our short answer is “yes.” If your boyfriend seems happier sitting on the couch as your girlfriends pedicure their toes than he is when the two of you are alone, it’s time to move on. Either he’s gay, over it, or after one of your friends. You can do better.
Hearts,
Rat and Cat
“But I saw him first!”
One of my friends just announced that she likes a guy in our House, but she has a habit of “claiming” people and then getting pissed if one of us flirts with them. Normally I don’t care, but this time I have a huge crush on the guy she “claimed.” Am I a bad friend if I pursue him?
—Annoyed in Adams
Dear Annoyed in Adams,
All’s fair in love and war—until someone hooks up with Adonis. Your friend can claim whomever she wants, but unless they’ve gotten physical, he’s a free agent. You might want to tell your friend that you like the guy too, just so when that inevitable make-out sesh at the Owl happens, she doesn’t feel blind-sided. But if your friend does hook up with him, call off the offense. Creep slowly away and never mention your interest again.
—Cat
Nonsense. Anyone can be claimed at any time. Disputes will then be settled with a threesome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three major financial investors shared their experiences in the industry and advised students on financial careers, during a panel discussion at the Harvard Faculty Club last night.
The event featured Julian H. Robertson, who co-founded and ran the largest hedge fund in the world before retiring, his son Alexander Robertson, who has worked alongside his father, and Richard Mayo, a founding partner at an investment management fund.
Over 150 students from nine student organizations attended the event.
Robertson, who was referred to as a “titan” during the event for turning $8 million of start-up capital in 1980 into over $23 billion by 1998, discussed finance as a career choice and his success in the field.
“It is very important to align interests with abilities,” Robertson said when asked about preparation for the financial world, adding that students should not give up after a set-back.
His son Alex Robertson followed up on his father’s point, telling the audience about his failed attempt to establish a hedge fund during his senior year in college before the dot-com bubble burst. He also said that great hedge fund managers are people who not only work hard and have a high degree of intelligence, but “can think outside of the box, and are competitive in different areas such as athletics and debate—a trait they will bring to the company.”
Ashley M. Kang ’12, who co-moderated the panel with William Richards, a senior hedge funds relationship manager at UBS, said the event was intended to bring the Harvard community together “for a shared intellectual pursuit.”
Regarding investment strategies, the panelists urged students to choose an area and specialize in it. The panel also highlighted the importance of equity in the turbulent market. However, “corporations are living and breathing organizations—they don’t just sit there and behave like investors want them to,” Mayo said, encouraging students to be critical of mainstream investing.
Describing concern about the about the U.S. economy, Robertson said that “we are saddling our grandchildren with those debts that we are not willing to pay off.”
Most investment opportunities present themselves in emerging markets, especially in China, the panelists said. Clients’ demand for physical gold has also surged because of high distrust in currencies in times of quantitative easing, Mayo said.
After the forum, a few members of the audience had a chance to chat with Robertson.
“People who worked for Robertson, or even people who worked for people who worked for him, practically started all hedge funds,” said Patrick C. Haley ’14, a founder of the student-run financial newsletter “College Stock Picks.” “He is the star at the top of the tree.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard graduate student was the victim of an unarmed robbery at the intersection of Brattle Street and Church Street Tuesday night, according to local police reports.
The graduate student, who lives on Plympton Street, told police that he was approached at around 9:30 p.m. near the Cambridge Center for Adult Education by two black males. They “smacked his cell phone out of his hand, pushed him to the ground, took his phone, and fled,” according to the Cambridge Police Department log and an e-mail from its spokesman, Daniel M. Riviello.
The victim injured his wrist when he fell to the ground. The Professional Ambulance Service evaluated him before transporting him to a hospital for further assessment, Riviello wrote in the e-mail.
The suspects were still at large as of yesterday, but the CPD is currently investigating the case, Riviello added.
This incident is the first robbery recorded on the Cambridge and Harvard University police logs in December on or near Harvard’s campus.
The incident marks the tenth robbery in the area and the fifth known incident that has involved Harvard affiliates since Nov. 1, when two Harvard affiliates were robbed separately near the Divinity School.
The last robbery near Harvard took place on Nov. 21, when a Harvard undergraduate male student was robbed by an unarmed male near the Quad.
Of the 10 robberies since November, six were committed by armed assailants.
The robberies have been scattered across Cambridge in locations near the Quad, the Divinity School, the Dudley Co-op, the Yard, and the Harvard Square T stop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences announced its decision Wednesday to continue its relationship with the Alícia Foundation and famous chef Ferran Adrià—founders of the popular course Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter”—following a successful first semester of the class.
Applied Math Professor and course instructor Michael P. Brenner met with both Pere Castells and Toni Massanés—scientific director and president of the Alícia Foundation, respectively—to renew the partnership after Wednesday’s science fair showcasing students’ final projects for the class.
Brenner said they were “extremely impressed” with how well the students did in their final projects and how much general excitement there is about the intersection of science and cooking at Harvard.
“This is something we would all like to continue...we are working to ensure that the course will continue, in collaboration with the Alicia Foundation,” Brenner said. “The details for next year are still being worked out and finalized.”
Adrià, a Spanish chef who helped to teach the course, will continue to take part in it for another five years as a visiting lecturer, according to the Dean of SEAS Cherry A. Murray.
The class began as an “experiment,” said Brenner.
“We did not know for sure that the class would ‘work,’” he said, citing the difficulty of developing an effective curriculum to teach science to non-scientists.
“The whole undertaking  could have gone wrong on a number of different levels,” Brenner said.
Physics Professor David A. Weitz, who co-founded and co-teaches the class with Brenner, said he was pleased with the success of the course.
“I spent all my life in academia trying to teach physics...often to nonscientists, and to be honest it’s a struggle and they don’t want to learn it,” Weitz said. “For the first time students were interested. They wanted to learn—they enjoyed it.”
This year, the money used to fund course expenses—including the travel costs for the course’s guest lecturers—came from donors and sponsorships. But according to Michael P. Rutter, the director of communications for SEAS, the class will likely invite more chefs from around the country in future sessions.
The course is designed to provide an understanding of the properties of soft matter through concepts and examples in cooking. Last September, approximately 700 students lotteried for the course, 300 of whom were invited to join.
“Since so many kids wanted to [take] it and didn’t have the opportunity to, it’s important to extend [the course],” said Julia S. Howland ’12, who was enrolled in the course this semester.
Although Weitz said he considers the course a success, he said he will try to improve the course next year based on student feedback.
In addition, Weitz will likely be teaching the course alone as Brenner is planning to take a sabbatical.
“Personally, I hope that this course exists at Harvard forever more,” Brenner said.
“A lot of effort was expended in inventing it, and to me this seems to have been an interesting and effective way to teach science,” he said.

Flour Bakery and Cafe owner Joanne B. Chang ’91—sporting a crisp chef’s coat—spoke about her experiences in the culinary world and signed copies of her new cookbook at a standing-room only event at the Harvard Book Store yesterday evening.
Chang first monetized her baking skills by making cookies for Leverett House Grille, which is no longer in existence, in order to raise money for new pairs of running shoes. The cookies, which she sold for 25 cents each, quickly became popular and kept her busy baking on weeknights, she said.
Her skill in the kitchen and their popularity led her to be known as “Chocolate Chip Cookie Girl,” according to Chang’s book.
“It was a nice break from problem sets,” she said.
After graduating from Harvard College, Chang began a career as a consultant at the Monitor Group, without expectations of entering the culinary world. Two years later, she decided to try something new and took a job in the kitchen of a popular Boston restaurant.
“Business was interesting to me, but it wasn’t compelling,” Chang said. “I get an incredible amount of joy when I’m in the kitchen baking pastries.”
Chang went through a variety of baking positions at a number of restaurants, including Rialto in Harvard Square, before eventually deciding to open her own bakery. While the bakery was popular from the time it opened, Chang said she often found it difficult to keep it going because of the intense pressure and long hours.
Now, 10 years later, Flour is a local favorite with three locations in the Boston area. Chang has also opened an Asian fusion restaurant named Myers + Chang with her husband.
While Chang said she would love to see more people enter the culinary industry, she warned those who are interested that the job may be tougher than they think.
“I think it’s important that [people interested in culinary arts] know that it’s not what they see on TV,” she said, emphasizing the long hours and intense dedication required.
For example, Chang said her job in the cake department of the Payard Patisserie and Bistro in New York City required her to work from 4 a.m. to midnight, six days a week.
Cambridge local Dorothy Valery said she could relate to Chang’s passion for baking.
“I always cook after a long day,” she said. “It’s just something I like to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the House of Representatives passed a bill that would grant some undocumented students a conditional path to citizenship Wednesday, the Senate voted yesterday to table the bill—rendering its passage unlikely during the lame duck session.
This week’s vote came as the result of a vow made by Senator Harry M. Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, prior to his re-election, to bring the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act to the floor.
If passed, the DREAM Act would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
Adan Acevedo ’13, events director of the Harvard College Democrats, said that he remains optimistic that two senators might change their votes, but he said that he does not see the DREAM Act passing during the lame duck session.
“I’m very disappointed by that,” Acevedo said, “but the Democratic leadership right now isn’t in the greatest position to negotiate.”
Newly-elected Harvard Republican Club President Michael W. McLean ’12 said that there is bipartisan agreement between Republicans and Democrats that the country is in need of “substantial” immigration reform, but he said that the DREAM Act should be debated as part of a comprehensive immigration policy.
McLean added that there are more important issues on the congressional agenda, and that the DREAM Act could be discussed after the lame duck period.
News of the stall in the Senate came one day after Harvard University President Drew G. Faust and Stanford University President John L. Hennessy co-wrote an opinion piece that appeared in Politico, stating their support for the DREAM Act.
Katie R. Zavadski ’13, campaigns director for the Harvard College Democrats, said that she was grateful for Faust’s support, noting that the recent attention to the DREAM Act showed that, for students, it had become a personal issue more than a political one.
“Some of the students, no matter what their political affiliation is, don’t want to see their friends and their blockmates get deported,” she said.
“I think that there’s still a lot of hope and a lot of passion for the immigrant rights movement,” said Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement.
“We can’t stop fighting for it.”
Along with the cloture on the DREAM Act, the Senate also rejected the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—a policy banning openly gay individuals from serving in the military, which was brought to the floor yesterday.

Ingrid Betancourt, a 2002 Colombian presidential candidate and former hostage of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), spoke about her book and her experiences in captivity to a packed audience on Wednesday evening.
In a talk co-sponsored by the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, Betancourt answered questions from Caroline M. Elkins, chair of the Committee on Ethnic Studies, who reviewed Betancourt’s memoir “Even Silence Has an End” for The New York Times in September.
“The book is at once a political text but also a stunning literary achievement,” Elkins said, adding that it addresses “how we think about lived experiences of hostages and how we approach it politically.”
Taken hostage by FARC on Feb. 23, 2002 and not rescued until July 2, 2008, Betancourt spent two-thirds of her captivity traveling from camp to camp. When not on the move, she endured crowded living spaces, the humiliation of constant obedience, and a strained dynamic between hostages that was especially directed at Betancourt, a high-profile political figure.
“It was so inspiring just seeing how she was able to remain strong,” Arturo Elizondo ’14 said.
During a book signing following Wednesday’s talk, one man in the audience criticized Betancourt with comments about her rescue. A 2009 memoir by three other FARC hostages also portrayed Betancourt as an intolerable fellow hostage, inciting controversy over her capture.
But Betancourt’s memoir addresses her struggle with a balance of self-critique and forgiveness. She called the writing process both “torture” and “rewarding.”
“Once it’s done, I just feel that it’s given me so much back,” Betancourt said.
Throughout her six and a half years in the Colombian jungle, Betancourt found hope in the memory of her children, the “love and dignity” taught to her by her parents, and isolated moments of kindness by the FARC—one guard taught her to weave, and the manual activity became a kind of meditation.
But the reality of captivity was usually filled with fear. Betancourt’s frequent attempts at escape were faced with brutal punishment, although during the question-and-answer session, she said that FARC guards—many of whom turn to the guerrilla organization as their best option—were as trapped as their hostages.
“Those guys dream exactly the way we dream,” she said.  “Prisoners might eventually escape, but guards will never escape.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the recent surge of robberies in the campus area, the Office of Student Life announced that the College is taking additional steps in conjunction with the Harvard University Police Department to deter crime.
The steps include increasing the number of officers on patrol during late evening hours and encouraging Harvard’s security guards to “adopt a more visible stance,” according to an e-mail Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson sent to undergraduates.
“The University is continually reviewing security measures and makes decisions based on the facts and circumstance present at that time,” Nelson wrote in an e-mail statement to The Crimson.
Nelson declined to comment further on her e-mail.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal declined to comment on the nature of Harvard security’s more visible stance or any other security measures yesterday evening in an e-mail.
There have been 10 robberies on or near campus since Nov. 1.
In the e-mail sent to the College, Nelson also urged students to be more vigilant and take measures such as locking doors and windows, storing HUPD’s emergency number, and making use of the Harvard University Campus Escort Program.
The program made 40 escorts this November, doubling the number of escorts they made during November 2009, according to information from HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano.
But this October, before the crime spree began, HUCEP made only 10 escorts, indicating that students have reacted to the increase in crime by turning to available safety resources.
Student reactions to the recent spate of crimes have been mixed.
“I try not to walk around by myself past 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.,” said Nicole D. Legnani ’03, who is now a Ph.D. student and lives in Harvard housing near the botanic garden.
Legnani said when she was an undergraduate, she used to walk around Harvard alone at 2 a.m. but has changed her attitude since the recent crimes began.
Some other students said the crimes did not make them more wary at night.
Catherine R. McCourt ’14 said she has not changed any of her usual practices because of the recent incidents but said she normally travels in groups late at night.
“I live in Boston anyways so I know these things happen,” McCourt said.
Some students said that they had not heard about the increase in crimes.
Others said they thought that the College is doing what it can to prevent crime, given Harvard’s urban location.
Lagnani said that it is difficult to say what else could be done besides putting more officers on patrol at night when most crimes have occurred.
McCourt suggested that the College could lock Harvard Yard’s gates, but he said such a measure would isolate Harvard from the community and make it inconvenient for students to enter and exit campus at night.
Akshay M. Sharma ’14, an Undergraduate Council representative of Ivy Yard, said he thinks that HUPD is “doing a phenomenal job” combating crime on campus.

Was your most recent term bill just a little too much to handle?
The Harvard men’s basketball team can help you out…maybe.
BetUS.com has the Crimson ranked second among its Ancient Eight counterparts in the website’s overall listing of college basketball betting odds. At 6-2 straight up and 3-1 against the spread, Harvard looks like a pretty safe bet.
BetUS cites last week's close loss to Michigan along with the early struggles of last year’s league-leaders including Cornell as reasons for the Crimson's appeal. The Big Red is only 2-6 SU and 2-3 ATS, earning seventh place in the ranking of Ivy teams. Columbia stands at the top of the list having gone 2-0 ATS. But the Lions have had a relatively easy schedule so far and still managed to drop four of their nine games.
Conference play won’t begin until after the break when Harvard takes on Dartmouth at home on Jan. 22.
That'll leave you with just enough time to cash in all those gift cards you’re bound to get and start placing your bets.
*The Crimson sports board does not promote gambling in any form. We're almost positive those Starbucks gift cards will come in handy when we come back to snowy Cambridge.

When the Harvard women’s hockey team finished its 3-1 dismantling of the University of New Hampshire, the skaters must have declared a collective TGIF: “Thank God it’s Fry-Day” in honor of freshman Lyndsey Fry.
With her team locked in a 1-1 stalemate after the first 20 frame, Fry scored the first two goals of her career in the second period to put the Crimson up for good last night in Durham, N.H.
“It was a good win,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We played well in all three zones. We had a lot of energy.”
But it was the Wildcats that got off to the fast start when UNH sophomore forward Kristina Lavoie put the puck past Crimson goalkeeper Laura Bellamy, also a sophomore, less than 10 minutes into the game.
Though Harvard went down early, it avoided panicking and running into penalty trouble. Instead it was the Wildcats that grew overeager: UNH picked up three penalties in the first period alone.
“I think we have a really resilient team,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “I don’t think we ever think that we’re out of the game. It’s just our mentality.”
A slashing call on Wildcat senior forward Julie Allen around 15 minutes into the first gave the Crimson the window it needed to even the score. Sophomore defenseman Josephine Pucci had the tying tally off assists from Leanna Coskren and Kate Buesser.
The second period was all Harvard, and, once again, it was a UNH penalty that opened up the ice.
The Crimson had been playing man down until a tripping penalty on Wildcat rookie Arielle O’Neill brought the teams to even strength at 6:59 in the second. Twenty-two seconds later, Harvard had a one-goal lead and Fry had her first career goal.
“She rolled to the net hard, used her body well,” Stone said.
Ten minutes later, Fry found the back of the net once more, again on an even strength, 5-on-5 goal.
The rookie’s goal came six seconds before the expiration of a cross-checking penalty on Lavoie and allowed the Crimson to enter its 24-second penalty kill with a two-goal cushion.
Harvard killed it, as it did on all three penalties it faced, a positive sign for a team that entered the contest ranked last in nation in penalty kill.
“Our penalty kill did very well,” Buesser said. “Our whole unit worked extremely well. We kept them from getting to the spots they wanted and taking the shots they wanted.”
The penalty kill was typical of the Crimson’s defensive effort last night.
“We were ready to play with our feet and our sticks,” Stone said. “When we keep our feet moving, good things will happen. Overall, it was nice to stay out of the [penalty] box.”
Harvard conceded only 14 shots all night. After allowing UNH seven shots in the opening period, the Crimson’s blue-liners gave up that many shots in next two frames combined, as Harvard outshot the Wildcats 16-3 and 8-4 in the second and third period, respectively.
“I thought it was a really great defensive effort,” Buesser said. “That was the biggest part of our game today.”
The performance was especially impressive given the challenges that come with playing in the Whittemore Arena, UNH’s home rink.
“It’s so big,” Buesser said of Whittemore. “The angles [the defensemen] play are a little tough. They got in the face of the UNH forwards and helped [sophomore goalkeeper Laura Bellamy] out and helped the forwards out.”
And whenever the Wildcats were able to break through, Bellamy was able to make the stop.
The netminder finished the game with 13 saves.
For Fry, the two-goal performance capped off the freshman’s recovery from mononucleosis. The Chandler, Ariz. native missed the Crimson’s first six games.
“She’s been coming back, getting better and better,” Stone said. “She’s progressing nicely. It’s nice to see some reward for that."
“It’s great to have her back,” Buesser added. “We’re expecting more from her.”
The performance gave Stone a win against her alma mater. A 1989 graduate of UNH, Stone played hockey and lacrosse for the Wildcats.
Stone captained both teams and was a national champion and All-American in lacrosse.
But Stone claims the win holds no special significance for her.
“It’s another big game on our schedule,” she said. “We’re looking to win every game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday night at the Bright Hockey Center, seven didn’t prove to be a lucky number for the Harvard men’s hockey team. Instead, the numeral represents the number of consecutive losses for the struggling Crimson (2-8-0, 2-7-0 ECAC), which fell to Quinnipiac (9-8-1, 4-5-1) by a score of 3-1.
The contest ended a four-game losing streak for the Bobcats, who were victorious despite being outshot 35-20.
“We’re obviously very frustrated,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I don’t really think that’s the best we can play...we haven’t been able to find a way to physically create the types of scoring chances we’d like.”
Neither team got a shot off until 2:30 into the game, when Quinnipiac forward Jeremy Langlois fired the puck on net but was denied by Crimson assistant captain goaltender Kyle Richter, who made a save between his legs.
Harvard had its first good chance to score seven minutes in, after Bobcat goalie Eric Hartzell left the net exposed on a puck behind the net. Crimson sophomore Conor Morrison took a pass coming up the middle and had a good look, but he was hit from the side and his ensuing shot went wide.
Two minutes later, Quinnipiac put the game’s first score on the board. Forward Kellen Jones skated down the right side of the ice and sent a pass across the zone to teammate Clay Harvey, whose one-timer deflected past Richter and in.
The teams traded good looks throughout the period, but neither could take advantage of its power-play opportunities. Harvard’s best chance, a slapshot from the right circle by junior defender Ryan Grimshaw, sailed over the net. Hartzell later made a kick save, as Crimson sophomore Danny Biega sent the puck flying through the Bobcat defense. Richter responded with a glove save of his own with 15 seconds remaining in the period to keep the game tied.
“Kyle was very solid,” Donato said. “He gave us a chance to be in the game...we’ve got to score some goals for him and get him a lead.”
Harvard evened things up 5:06 into the second period, when, after a skirmish in the right corner, junior Alex Killorn was able to emerge and redirect the puck off the side of the net.  Classmate Eric Kroshus picked it up in the slot and put it through Hartzell’s legs for his third goal of the season.
“There was good pressure that shift,” Kroshus said. “A few times the puck turned over on forecheck. I just wanted to get rid of it quickly and luckily it went in.”
But Quinnipiac responded on a power play just three minutes later after a too-many-men penalty on the Crimson. Defenseman Mike Dalhuisen picked off a Harvard attempt to clear and sent a pass to Langlois, who hit Dunbar coming around the net on the right side. After a skirmish in front, Dunbar was able to put the puck off a Crimson defender’s skate and redirect it past Richter, giving the Bobcats the 2-1 advantage.
Moments later, Quinnipiac had a great chance to expand their lead. But after a shot fired from the top of the left circle deflected off Richter, the goalie dove backwards, landed on the puck, lost his stick in the ensuing scramble in front, and held on until the puck was cleared.
Harvard was unable to respond on a power-play in the final three minutes of the half after Hartzell denied multiple direct shots on goal.
“I think [Hartzell] was very solid,” Donato said. “They did an excellent job blocking shots in front of him.”
About four minutes into the third, the Bobcats opened their advantage further. After Richter made a kick save with his right pad on a Dalhuisen shot, Langlois took the rebound and put it back over the senior’s shoulder to give Quinnipiac the 3-1 edge.
Hartzell denied the Crimson the rest of the way, and his impressive performance was highlighted by a kick save with his right pad on a Killorn wrist shot. Sophomore Marshall Everson later had a great look in front after taking a pass from Biega behind the net, but was denied by the sophomore goalie. Hartzell then made a string of saves with Harvard playing a man up in the final minute to preserve the victory.
“They’re a big defense,” Kroshus said. “We tried to put a lot of pressure on them. We did that, [but] their goaltender played pretty well tonight.”
It was the Crimson’s second loss in as many weeks to the Bobcats after falling 5-4 in Hamden, Conn. on November 20. The team now has a three-week break before renewing action New Year’s Day at the Sheraton/TD Bank Catamount Cup in Vermont.
“[Right now], we don’t have the energy and the cohesion to really bring out some of the talent that’s in the locker room,” Donato said. “It’s a challenge for us. The break probably comes at a good time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The five games remaining on the non-conference schedule for the Harvard men’s basketball team run the widest gamut possible: from the cellar of collegiate hoops to the highest tier in the land.
Over the upcoming weeks, the squad will travel to No. 7/9 UConn on Dec. 22 and then host lowly Monmouth a week later.
On New Year’s Eve, MIT—a Division III program—will visit Lavietes Pavilion before the Crimson heads to Boston College Jan. 5.
The wide range of match-ups—in which Harvard will be either a heavy favorite or underdog—makes tomorrow afternoon’s contest against Boston University (4-6) an even more crucial test for the Crimson (6-2) before it begins Ivy League play next month.
“Just being able to regroup in practice and come out and play well is pretty important for our team,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “Obviously we want to win, but we just want to play better as a team, and BU gives us a chance to do that.”
Hoping to avenge a 78-70 loss suffered to Harvard last November, the Terriers will enter Lavietes Pavilion fresh off a heartbreaking 84-81 defeat by La Salle Thursday evening.
The team’s leading scorer at 17 points per game, senior wing John Holland had a rough night coming off the bench, picking up 15 points and three assists against the Explorers.
“Holland is such a fierce competitor and an attacking scorer—very much a player that we’re very concerned with,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “He just has an aggression about him that puts you on your heels a lot, so we need to make sure we play him before he gets the ball.”
Arguably the top player in his conference, the two-time swingman poured in a team-high 18 points in BU’s loss to Harvard last year.
The Terriers’ main force down low is junior Jake O’Brien, a versatile big man averaging 11 points and six boards a contest.
Junior guard Darryl Partin, a transfer from La Salle, has also been a solid offensive contributor alongside Holland and O’Brien. He had a team-high 20 points to go along with six rebounds and five assists against his former team Thursday.
Nabbing a second consecutive victory against its crosstown rivals will be no easy task for Harvard—now without guard Jeremy Lin ’10, who keyed his team to a win over BU last year with an outstanding 16-point second half performance.
After reaching the semifinals of the postseason College Basketball Invitational last year, the Terriers were selected as the preseason favorites to capture this year’s America East title, in what is coach Pat Chamber’s second year at the helm.
Most notably, BU carries on its resume a nail-biting home win over Cornell two weeks ago but has fallen on the road to Northeastern and Bucknell this season.
Regardless of the caliber of its opponent, Harvard will have its own goals in mind, as it aims to rebound from an underwhelming performance against WPI on Tuesday evening.
After falling in a narrow road loss to Michigan last Saturday, returning home turned out to be more difficult than expected, as the Crimson proved unable to convincingly put away its Division III visitors. Boosted by McNally’s game-high 20 points and sophomore guard Christian Webster’s 17, Harvard ultimately came away with the 69-54 win—not to mention several areas to improve upon.
“Defensively, I think we need to be better—just staying in front of the ball,” McNally said. “And rebounding—we didn’t do a good job of either those two things.”
A big boost on both ends of the floor could come in the form of sophomore star Kyle Casey, who did not play against WPI and saw only seven minutes of action at Michigan due to a virus.
Amaker said that Casey—the league’s reigning Rookie of the Year—practiced Thursday afternoon and that he was hopeful he would be available tomorrow.
Harvard’s other front-court mainstay, junior co-captain Keith Wright, will attempt to have his way inside against O’Brien, who at 6’8 is the tallest player in the Terriers’ regular rotation. Look for Chambers to utilize a four-guard lineup versus his hosts, which will counter with plenty of backcourt firepower of their own.
Hot-shooting freshman Laurent Rivard, who was named league Rookie of the Week, not to mention McNally and Webster, will all have the green light to fire away as they try to lead Harvard to its seventh win of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re in the thick of reading and finals period and many of you are probably hibernating to finish writing final papers and studying for exams for which you’ve never cracked open a textbook. It seems that the athletic teams are also undergoing this hibernation period. There’s not much action for Harvard sports teams this weekend, but there are still three home matchups for fans who want to cheer on the Crimson squads.
The men’s basketball team hosts Boston University tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m. Going into last weekend, the men’s squad had won five straight games, but the streak ended against Michigan in a three-point defeat. The Crimson rebounded and dominated against Worcester Polytechnic Institute on Wednesday to add another win to its record. Currently 6-2, the men are going to have to work hard to win against Boston University tomorrow. The last time the two teams faced off was in 2008 when the Terriers handed the Crimson its second loss of the season. The team has improved, though, in the past two years and will be sure to give Boston University much tougher competition this time around.
Also up this weekend is women’s basketball. The women’s team is currently 4-3 after losing to Florida by over 20 points on Tuesday. The women look to bounce back from the loss tonight at 7 p.m. against New Hampshire with the home crowd’s support. The squad will also have to step up its game to pull off the victory because the women lost to New Hampshire the last time the two teams faced off—the game went into overtime, but the Crimson ultimately fell by 13 points.
Finally, the women’s ice hockey team has a match tonight at 7 p.m. against Boston University. The squad just pulled itself out of a three-game losing streak against New Hampshire last night. It’s going to be a tough matchup, but this could be the game that gets the women over .500 again this season. Last year, the Crimson tied, 1-1, against the Wildcats at home.
So, take a little bit of time out of your weekend to show your Harvard teams some support. These weekend games will act as a great study break to relax from the stress of finals and will prove to be exciting matchups.
And of course, the best way to do well on finals is to attend Harvard’s most prestigious athletic event in the Yard this Sunday at midnight.

The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, is suing the movie-making company National Lampoon over licensing fees.
In 1970, two Harvard Lampoon alumni and one current Lampoon writer produced the first issue of National Lampoon magazine. The humorous publication later loaned its name to hit films including National Lampoon’s Animal House and National Lampoon’s Vacation.
According to Courthouse News Service, the National Lampoon has paid licensing fees to the Harvard organization since 1969 for the use of its name. Now, claiming that the National Lampoon has not paid those dues in nearly four years, the Harvard Lampoon is demanding a payment of $145,000.
Shortly after the Harvard Lampoon filed its complaint, National Lampoon shareholders sued the company, complaining that it had made false statements about share prices.
This isn’t the first time the Harvard Lampoon has been defensive of its title. In 2004, the magazine threatened to sue the Georgetown Lampoon (a humor magazine at Georgetown  University), for its choice of name. To avoid the suit, the Georgetown Lampoon became the Georgetown Heckler.
Whatever the outcome of this pending suit, nobody seems to be treating it as a laughing matter.

Thanks to the Internet, there are infinite ways to procrastinate while studying in your room. But wouldn’t it be nice to divert your eyes from the computer screen while you’re avoiding your papers and projects? Find your modus operandi for Internet procrastination below to discover the new location where you should be studying – or not studying.
If you avoid work by visiting...
hulu.com, try studying in Lamont’s Farnsworth Room, the campus hub for pleasure reading. From mystery novels to harlequin romances, the Farnsworth Room is a choice spot for TV-like reading material.
foodporn.com, then work in Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library, which boasts the largest collection of historic cookbooks in the country, including Julia Child's original cookbook drafts.
cuteoverload.com, then study in the Ernst Mayr Library at the Museum of Comparative   Zoology. Not only does the library have a complimentary espresso machine (donations encouraged), but the museum also has books about almost every animal imaginable. If you get tired of books, just take the elevator to the third floor to visit the museum’s real (dead, stuffed) animals.
xtube.com, then study in the “Cage” in the bowels of the Fine Arts Library. There, after being admitted by a trained librarian, you can fritter away your hours looking at Harvard's erotica collection.
engadget.com, then consider the top floor of Cabot Library in the Science Center. In this a small, almost uninhabited nook, only your gadgets will keep you company.
harvardfml.com, then clearly you are a fan of the misery of others. Head over to Houghton Library and check out an original copy of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The 16th-century tome has enough gruesome pictures of people being burned at the stake (including a fetus busting from a burning martyr's stomach), to make modern students’ complaints seem dull by comparison.
flybyblog.com, then stay in your room. Continue reading. You are procrastinating correctly.
