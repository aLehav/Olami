ON THE ROAD, Israel—Driving through the United States can often feel like traversing endless miles of road, city, and scarcely a patch of a wilderness. On American soil, I have never felt in two places at once: We are almost always in the developed world or the natural world, and when we inhabit one we can be reasonably sure that the other is a long way away.
In Israel, it’s impossible to travel without weaving rapidly through city and nature. Israel’s two urban centers, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, are just an hour’s drive from one another, and it is less than two hours from either city to the next largest—Haifa. You can scarcely even drive through a single major American metro area in an hour’s time. Of course, this makes sense: The United States is 40 times more populous and almost 500 times larger than the state of Israel.
But it’s not that cities in Israel are extremely close together so much as that the distinction between city and natural world is strikingly ill-defined. If in America you are never in both at once, in Israel you can rarely be sure which one you’re in—at least, not for long. Driving through Israel is instead like driving through the natural world with cities placidly growing out of it; there is no great contrast, and certainly no hostility, between settled and wild land.
The Torah refers repeatedly to Israel as “eretz rechava,” a spacious, expansive land, though it was tiny even by ancient standards. Admittedly, that’s probably because it was written by Israelites thousands of years ago. But it’s remarkable just how true that unlikely characterization is. In such a small place there is so much of everything so close together—forest, mountain, plain, and city, side by side and all intricately enlaced. The drive that I have taken so many times from St. Louis to Chicago takes as long as it would to traverse the entire state of Israel, but on that drive you look at nearly the same thing the entire time. The endless and empty expanse feels not expansive but suffocating, so unlike the expansiveness of Israel’s narrow contours.
Jewish thought additionally tells us that the difference between the lands of Egypt and Israel is that in Egypt a person in need of water takes it at will from the Nile, but in Israel, water is in short and unreliable supply, furnished not by man’s will but by God’s. Israel is a holy land for the rather unintuitive reason that its scarcity of water and material instability compels its people to depend on and develop a close relationship with the divine.
All of which points us to the intimate relation between nation, divinity, and geography in Judaism; Israel’s unimpressive size as well as its paucity of resources is thought to be not a weakness but a source of spiritual depth for the Jewish people. Even and perhaps especially to a secular person like me, it seems remarkable that Israel’s modest contours encompass such a spiritually expansive land.

HAIFA, Israel--“Sababa?” I asked her in colloquial Hebrew, meaning “You alright?” She nodded and grabbed a blue marker from my hand to color in the Hamsa she was making.
A few seconds later I grew bored. “Sababa” I said again, this time meaning, “Hey let’s go somewhere else—maybe the playground—I hear they have paddle ball.”
She raised an eyebrow and responded with a long breath of ch’s and ba’s that I did not understand. I think it was Hebrew or perhaps Russian. Probably not Spanish.
“Que?” I asked just in case.
She looked at me wide eyed and confused. It was definitely not Spanish.
Using her body language and context clues I could tell she was asking the question, Why are a bunch of ignorant Americans at my school, and why are they so bad at coloring in the lines?
I didn’t really know either. The program, Boston Connection, an organization that connects students from Boston to their sister city in Haifa, essentially just dropped us off at an elementary school, gave us some markers and told us to “connect.” I wasn’t quite sure how we could connect when the only words we had in common were “ok” and “bathroom."
So after going to the bathroom seven times and discovering that everyone, even the boy who had fallen while playing hopscotch, was doing okay, I was beginning to think that this trip to the school was a little hopeless and that the only connecting I was doing was to my inner ignorance.
But then Gangnam Style came on.
My first instinct was to cringe—another language I didn’t understand: outdated pop culture. My second instinct was to dance, but that would be embarrassing. I didn’t want these kids to know that I never learned all the dance moves to the song. But while repressing the urge to gallop like an injured horse, I noticed out of the corner of my eye that my new friend (and I use this word liberally) was nodding her head to the beat.
So I grabbed her hand. “Let’s dance.” I said “Bailemos.” I had to double check.
She was hesitant, but from her body language and lack of verbal protest, I could tell that she really wanted me to drag her to the front of the classroom and make her dance.
She stayed for the entire song, hoping around and showing me the correct dance moves (lasso yes, sprinkler no). When the song ended, someone, perhaps a teacher, perhaps the ghost of PSY, replayed the song. From the way she kept smiling I could tell she was finally having fun, and from the way she kept pointing at me and laughing at my pelvic thrusts I could tell that we were bonding.  And when I tried to sit down because I am too cool (out of shape) to dance to the same song twice, she dragged me back up.
“Sababa” she said. She was a smart girl.
So perhaps there are ways to connect without words, as even with my limited vocabulary, I was able to successfully convey to her that I was a horrible dancer, and even though we didn’t share a language, she was able to convey to me that she did not care.

For the second year in a row, Kelsey A. Beck ’14 is taking the stage to compete for the title of Miss Massachusetts. Last year’s Miss Boston, Beck will compete starting Friday night in hopes of representing the Commonwealth at the Miss America pageant in September.
Beck, a rising Kirkland House senior from Florida who entered her first pageant last year, won the Miss Lakeville competition on March 10, landing her a spot in the Miss Massachusetts pageant. Beck says she could not compete for the title of Miss Boston a second time because she won the competition last year.
If crowned Miss Massachusetts on Saturday, Beck will earn scholarship money and a chance to compete for the title of Miss America.
"It's just been a whirlwind, and I'm just so blessed [with] the opportunity to possibly represent the state of Massachusetts this upcoming weekend,” Beck says.
In order to win the Miss Massachusetts title, Beck will have to answer an on-stage question and walk in swimsuit and evening gown portions of the event. In addition, for the talent portion, Beck says that she plans to play a selection on the piano—“Toccata,” a composition that her mother played while competing in the Miss America Pageant after winning the title of “Miss Florida 1971.”
Since she was crowned Miss Lakeville, Beck has engaged in various kinds of service work, including volunteering at nursing homes. Her platform in the competition, which outlines a charitable cause she will advocate for as a pageant winner, focuses on advocacy for the elderly and inspiring youth.
Reflecting on her experience with pageantry thus far, Beck says she is grateful for the support of the community at Harvard.
What’s she excited for? “Everything,” Beck says.
"We actually run out to…'Run the World (Girls),'” Beck says. “I'm just excited to get up there, and have fun, and smile."
