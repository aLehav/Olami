After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—At the start of this summer, waiting at a stoplight just a two minute drive from my house, my friend decided to quiz me. I was hoping for an easy pop quiz on inflation’s implications for 1990s Latin American economic policy or Plato’s theory of the Forms. But alas, no. He wanted to see if I knew what street we were on. It took me several guesses before he took pity on me (and by taking pity, I mean mercilessly roasting me for having lived in the same house for seventeen years and still not knowing a road three blocks away).
I am, in the words of my long-suffering friends, “navigationally challenged.” My sense of direction (or lack thereof) has become a running joke over the years, as I struggle to travel from point A to point B, even if point B is just a five minute stroll away. I take wrong turns that others wouldn’t even know existed, walk in circles, and often end up further away from my destination than I was when I set out.
Though I remain convinced that I have some genetic inability to interpret maps, the extent of my navigational failure cannot be explained without acknowledging my own faults. I wander about with my head in the clouds. My mother always calls me a “space cadet”—although I doubt I would last long in space without Google Maps to tell me if I’ve accidentally veered into the asteroid belt.
Momentarily forgetting my exceptional gift for not knowing my left from my right, I decided that it would be a great idea to move to New York City for the summer. The subway system became my personal nightmare. In one particularly embarrassing episode, I struggled to find the Empire State Building on my first day of work. I still don’t know how I managed that one.
When I told my friends from back home about my misadventures, they very sympathetically informed me that I was an absolute idiot. New York City is literally a grid system. If cereal boxes had the New York City map on them rather than mazes, kindergarteners would complain it was too easy to solve. And yet here I was, technically a legal adult, struggling to understand that there are multiple subway stops on 34th Street. I think there are multiple stops, anyway. I’m really not the person to be asked about this.
But, as much to my surprise as anyone else’s, I have gotten better. My rate of getting on the wrong subway has dropped to an impressive one time per week. New York has forced me to pay attention to street signs and subway schedules, breaking through my daze of absent-minded musings. Brightly colored murals, eccentrically dressed pedestrians, and adorably small dogs suddenly appear where once they were blurred out by my daydreams.
Heading home from work the other day, a tourist stopped me in the subway station. “Uptown?” she asked, gesturing at the various signs in obvious confusion. And to my total shock, I instantly knew the way for her to go. Pointing her in the right direction, I felt oddly vindicated. Of course, a few days later I got on the wrong line again, finding myself trapped in a subway car filled with rowdy elementary school baseball players as I was whisked away to the outskirts of Queens. But for a moment, I was not the most lost person in all of Manhattan. Slowly, I was finding my way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since the fourth grade, when I heard Soulja Boy’s creatively-titled hit single, “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” I’ve been an avid rap fanatic. I was a lanky awkward white girl who’d blast Kanye West lyrics I was too young to understand on my bright pink iPod Nano. My high school senior yearbook quotation was Lil Wayne’s famous “I go so hard they call me go so hard,” and I even went so far as to write my college essay on how rap music changed my life. One short year later, however, in an atmosphere of perpetual political conversation and controversy, I find that rap has become more stunningly relevant than ever.
What initially fascinated me so strongly about rap music was its blunt, unapologetic tone. Often, its lyrics are provocative, risqué, and so explicit it’s shocking they ever see the light of public radio. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to witness people speaking free of restraint or boundary, and without fear of stepping over the line.
I observe self-censorship frequently among my peers and the people around me. In Silicon Valley, a family refrains from displaying a “Romney 2012” banner on their front porch. A Republican college student hurriedly peels off a “Big Government, Big Problems” sticker from their laptop before stepping back on campus. Abraham Lincoln rolls over in his grave. So it goes.
The problem is not that people are frightful of openly proclaiming unpopular political views. In fact, being scared to do so is good—it signifies the recognition of the vulnerability of difficult discussion while simultaneously possessing the open-minded understanding that not everyone, and sometimes no one, will agree. The issue is that something must come next. Accept that you will hesitate, but, like rap music, speak anyway.
There is a surprisingly easy solution to feared accidental offensiveness, which brings me to the next admirable element of rap: Its utilization of shock factor. The overwhelming promiscuity of Nicki Minaj, the pushing-the-envelope lyrics of Drake, and the taboo topics of Lil Wayne’s verses, whether intentional or not, get people listening. Most importantly, they get people talking. A flaw of politically-engaged millennials is their assumption that debate is meant to persuade the other side into agreement. The most important part of a debate, however, is not the resolution, but rather the conversation itself.
Allowing yourself to hear what is shocking to you and unthinkable to your morals only provides you with a broader comprehension of the issue on which you are taking a stance. It urges you to understand why people choose to march against you rather than alongside you, while knowing you are under no obligation to acquiesce. Not being able to change someone’s mind does not mean the argument you posed is illogical or unworthy of consideration. However, many people believe shocking arguments to be invalid, and thus refuse to approach their legitimacy, only burying themselves deeper into a self-built bubble of comfort.
Take, for example, the widespread dismissal of—God forbid—voters for Donald Trump as merely uneducated. The ruthless amounts of blame and critique pointed towards lower-class conservatives signify nothing other than the accusers being unwilling to listen, assuming their opinion is the only one worth uttering. Simply put, open-mindedness is stunted when one waves away an idea as too absurd to be true solely for its shock factor, or for its resonating as out of the ordinary.
We need to allow the shocking to teach us that there are people who think in manners previously unknown to us, and let it urge us to begin conversation. Our freedom of speech should be of utmost importance, and we should not flinch when we observe others taking full advantage of this monumental right. Hesitate, but speak. Be surprised, and surprise others in return. Do not run away from what you do not know, for your understanding will be nothing without it.
This is what ties rap music so closely to the United States: Its total embrace of freedom of speech. Its fearlessness to proclaim what it believes to be worth proclaiming, knowing that it will be heard. It encompasses principles upon which our country was founded, which seem to be escaping us more and more every day.
Next time the fierce words of Kendrick Lamar suddenly appear on your Spotify, listen. We could all afford to be a little more like Kendrick Lamar.

In an effort to make the Square even more unaffordable, parking rates will increase by 50 cents, to $1.50 per hour starting this week. This rate increase, the first one since 2008, stems from the high demand for parking in Cambridge and will support other transportation initiatives across the city, according to the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department.
For other crowded areas in Cambridge, the rate will increase to $1.25, while less-congested areas will maintain the original $1 per hour fee.
This change means that, for tourists, Bostonians, and locals who want to spend a good day in the Square, the $15 that you brought for a souvenir t-shirt at The Coop may instead end up in a parking meter. While parking for an eight hour day last week would have cost you $8, it will now cost you $12. But turn that frown upside down—at least you’ll be able to find a parking space with this new congestion-reducing policy change! Or, so they say...
To help you budget (and hopefully encourage any visitors to take the T), we at Flyby have compiled seven things that you could buy in the Square with a day’s worth of parking fees.
1. Two burritos and frozen custard from Felipe’s. Or two super burritos. Either way, you’re eating good.
2. Two pints of BerryLine froyo. That’s two whole pints. TWO pints. You’ll most likely be eating it in one go, but still.
3. A couple of high-quality pens from Bob Slate Stationer. It’s never to early to get a head start on back-to-school shopping! Just think about all the time you’ll spend in Lamont with these pens in hand. *swoon*.
4. A large iced latte, a bacon breakfast sandwich, and half-a-dozen donuts from Dunkin’. It’s time to celebrate with a feast. Harvard runs on Dunkin’.
5. Something from the Urban Outfitters’ sales basement. Yeah, it might be ripped on all sides, acid-washed, and promote a band you’ve never heard of, but for $10? That’s a deal.
6. A pair of no-show socks from Concepts. It’s not quite enough money to buy crew socks, though. You’ll have to wait on that one—sorry to disappoint.
7. A Mexican Corn Elote Bowl with a Blueberry Basil Fresca from Sweetgreen. When Sweetgreen is cheaper than the Square’s new parking rates, you know the struggle is real.
