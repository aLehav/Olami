After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hip-hop, like other musical genres and art forms, has had no choice but to grapple with the coronavirus. Back in March, tours froze and venues shut their doors, but recording studios stayed open. Throughout the pandemic, rappers have taken to the booth to assess the new normal — empty grocery shelves, PPE, and the NBA bubble. Here’s a list of the top five rap songs about COVID-19.
5. “Quarantine Clean” by Turbo, Gunna, & Young Thug
Released in April, “Quarantine Clean,” by Atlanta artists Turbo, Gunna, and Young Thug, is a response to the stay-at-home orders issued in March. On the cover art for the track, the trio makes self-quarantine look cool — sporting hazmat suits and face masks. The track features Thug and Gunna’s trademark slick and melodic lyricism aided by solid production from Turbo. The song was one of the first to address COVID in the rap genre. On the second verse of the song, Thug raps: “I skate off to the house and I lock myself in.” Except for its timely subject matter, the track isn’t particularly memorable among the extensive catalogs of Gunna and Thug.
4. “Okay (feat. Heavy Steppers)” by DCG Shun & DCG Bsavv
“Okay” is a pop drill track from Chicago brothers DCG Shun and DCG Bsavv released in May. Shun, 17, and Bsavv, 19, first tasted success during the pandemic. On the track, Shun acknowledges the frustrating timing of his come up: “Can’t wait to get back on the road / Due to corona we can’t do no shows.” The pair's infectiously energetic delivery and snappy production helped them go viral: The “Okay” video has almost two million views on YouTube. Thanks to their refreshingly unique sound, Shun and Bsavv have the potential to keep growing even with COVID restrictions. The whole DCG team, which includes Shun, Bsavv, and their friend DCG Msavv, are ones to watch out of Chicago.
3. “Lockdown (feat. Jay Rock)” by Anderson .Paak
Released on Juneteenth, “Lockdown” is a stirring call to action against police brutality and racial injustice by L.A. artist Anderson .Paak. The track and companion music video are a response to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and subsequent civil unrest across the country amidst coronavirus lockdowns. On the hook of the single, .Paak sings: “You shoulda been downtown / The people are rising.” Jay Rock’s feature contains some of the best lyricism this year. The track achieves similar quality and emotion to other classic West Coast protest songs like “We Had to Tear this Muthafucka Up” by Ice Cube, which was released following the 1992 L.A. riots.
(The song would be number one on this list if not for questionable lyrics in the extended version of Jay Rock’s verse, which promote conspiracy theories relating to vaccination and the origin of the pandemic.)
2. “Quarantine” by Black Soprano Family & Benny the Butcher
Released in April, “Quarantine” is Buffalo rapper Benny the Butcher’s assertion that nothing can slow him down — not even lockdown. The song is one of the better cuts off the debut album from Benny’s label, Black Soprano Family. Over a throwback guitar beat, Benny acknowledges his success: “It’s your turn you gotta bat for the fences / Had to switch it up ‘cause hustlin’ don’t come with a pension.” Also a member of Griselda Records, Benny has had a blockbuster 2020, releasing an album with heavyweight producer Hit-Boy and working with Drake on an as yet unreleased collab.
Despite these successes, the Griselda team could not avoid the impact of COVID. DJ Shay, Benny’s longtime mentor and producer, died from the virus in August. To honor Shay, Benny pushed back the release of his album, attributing much of his success, including the launch of Black Soprano Family, to his late friend.
1. “Gold and Chrome” by Curren$y & Harry Fraud
“Gold and Chrome,” is New Orleans rapper Curren$y’s take on the state of the world from the perspective of a young father. The song is a track from his third collaborative album with producer Harry Fraud, “The OutRunners,” which was released in July. Supported by superb beatmaking from Fraud, Curren$y laments the severity of the virus and his son’s future: “I'm sure change gon' take some years / But I hope it all clear before my son hit the streets.” In addition to COVID, he also expresses worry for the safety of his son from police brutality: “These crooked cops will put your dead body in cuffs.” Curren$y’s delivery is poignant and effortless. The song ranks among the best in his discography — and it’s the best rap song about this pandemic of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Avatar: The Last Airbender” is one of the best animated series of all time. In fact, it’s one of the best shows of all time, full stop. There, I said it. The series as a whole is excellent, but how do the individual episodes stack up? By no popular demand, here is an entirely objective ranking of all 61 episodes of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” from worst to best.
Lots of spoilers ahead.
61. Book 1, Episode 1: “The Boy in the Iceberg”
The first is the worst. It’s a good sign when a series only goes up from the first episode.
60. Book 1, Episode 11: “The Great Divide”
This episode is fine. It’s a bit moralistic and heavy-handed, even if Aang’s lie to the two tribes is hilarious.
59. Book 1, Episode 2: “The Avatar Returns”
For the record, Aang was never officially unbanished from the Southern Water Tribe. And off the bat, Zuko shows he has honor — he promises to leave in peace if given the Avatar, and he does. It deftly establishes Zuko’s potential, and when Aang, Sokka and Katara take off on Appa, it’s the real beginning of the show.
58. Book 1, Episode 5: “The King of Omashu”
Insane King Bumi’s introduction is fun, even if it’s a bit obvious that he’s Aang’s childhood friend.
57. Book 1, Episode 4: “The Warriors of Kyoshi”
Sokka learns that girls can fight too and Aang learns that hero worship is a double-edged sword. Fun is had by all.
56. Book 1, Episode 14: “The Fortune Teller”
This episode gave us memorable exchanges like “Can your science explain why it rains?” “Yes! Yes, it can!” — not to mention some lovely messages about shaping your own destiny — but is largely inconsequential.
55. Book 1, Episode 7: “Winter Solstice — Part 1: The Spirit World” 
Exposition time: In addition to learning the four elements, the Avatar has a spiritual responsibility. This episode is fine.
54. Book 1, Episode 6: “Imprisoned”
This is a Katara episode. Like the preteens and teenagers that Aang, Katara and Sokka are, they see getting captured by the enemy and becoming a literal prisoner of war in order to incite resistance against oppressors as a good plan. Honestly, it’s exactly in the spirit of Avatar. It turns out the Gaang can’t make people want to fight; because “Avatar” is all about choices, the Earth Kingdom prisoners have to choose it for themselves.
53. Book 1, Episode 9: “The Waterbending Scroll”
Another Katara episode — in case you were starting to think she was the Mom Friend, she decides to steal from pirates, before Zuko’s cronies get involved, and it goes about as well as you’d expect. A great ride.
52. Book 1, Episode 8: “Winter Solstice — Part 2: Avatar Roku”
Naked Iroh fights off Earth Kingdom soldiers, we meet Aang’s predecessor Avatar Roku, and the Gaang successfully convince a murderous panda spirit not to kidnap villagers. The exposition has a point, thankfully, so it’s ultimately an enjoyable episode.
51. Book 1, Episode 3: “The Southern Air Temple”
You thought this was going to be a happy-go-lucky kids adventure? Sorry, turns out Aang is the only survivor of a genocide of his people. We also meet antagonist Admiral Zhao, who Zuko defeats in the show’s first Agni Kai. When Zuko wins he shows more honor than Zhao does by taking his victory with grace, further setting up Zuko’s spectacular redemption arc.
50. Book 1, Episode 15: “Bato of the Water Tribe”
Up to this point in the series, Aang has been a funny, lighthearted and well-meaning kid. Here he does something bad out of fear and reaps the consequences, as he learns to trust his found family.
49. Book 2, Episode 2: “The Cave of Two Lovers”
As well as being a Kataang episode, this one showcases a delightfully wacky group of nomads who increase in number as the episode goes on, sing the absolute jam “Secret Tunnel,” and make Sokka facepalm so much his face goes red. Classic.
48. Book 1, Episode 10: “Jet”
Jet is the original bad boy, and the first seed of one of the show’s ultimate messages is shown: No one nation is the good guy, and no one nation is the bad guy. People in pain may do terrible things and convince themselves that awful violence and hatred are excusable. Here, “Avatar” tells us that such violence is never okay.
47. Book 1, Episode 17: “The Northern Air Temple”
Teo is wheelchair-bound with the soul of an airbender, so Aang decides to share his culture. Moreover, the Gaang give the village a way to fight back against the Fire Nation, which has been forcing Teo’s father to build machinery for it. Here, “Avatar” is teaching that you should always fight and try to do the right thing, even when you’re backed into a corner.
46. Book 2, Episode 5: “Avatar Day”
The Gaang follow Sherlock-esque clues to prove Avatar Kyoshi couldn’t have have committed a mysterious murder, only for Kyoshi to show up and admit she did it before peacing out. It’s hilarious, and hilariously pro-murder for a children’s show.
45. Book 2, Episode 4: “The Swamp”
We see how Sokka was affected by losing Yue, Katara still feeling the loss of her mother, and hints pointing to a lifelong friend Aang is about to meet. It’s an absurd and fun Wizard of Oz-style episode.
44. Book 3, Episode 9: “Nightmares and Daydreams”
Not the best Book 3 has to offer but it’s a worthy part of the season nonetheless. It’s the run-up to the Fire Nation Invasion and Aang is a scared kid with hilarious nightmares.
43. Book 1, Episode 13: “The Blue Spirit”
“Do you think we could’ve been friends?” Zuko dons a mask and rescues Aang for completely selfish reasons, and Aang learns more about the war and the state of the world. It’s a great showing for Aang, Zuko, and Admiral Zhao.
42. Book 2, Episode 1: “The Avatar State”
The Gaang’s first meeting with an earth kingdom official is with one who is callous, corrupt, and manipulative. Good and evil are not easily separated during war and this character is a fantastically nuanced way to show it. Moreover, we see the best villain introduction ever when Azula says “Maybe you should worry less about the tides, who’ve already made up their minds about killing you, and worry more about me, who’s still mulling it over.” Azula is not only intimidating as hell, but her descent into madness is already being foreshadowed.
41. Book 1, Episode 12: “The Storm”
This episode once more highlights how “Avatar” is both morally profound and totally worth being an internet sensation. Zuko and Aang both reveal their backstories during a storm. Alone and afraid, Aang ended up in the iceberg after he ran away from his destiny, so he wasn’t there to protect his people. As a kid, Zuko broke the rules and spoke out in a council meeting, so he was burned and banished by his father. This episode also illustrates their complementary character flaws: Aang runs away out of fear, while Zuko unwisely runs headlong into more problems.
40. Book 2, Episode 7: “Zuko Alone”
An incredibly important, incredibly sad lesson for Zuko. He did a good thing — protecting a young boy from Earth Kingdom thugs — but did so while trying to cling to pride for the nation that caused the war that gave those thugs power. He discovers that being a kind stranger and being proud of the Fire Nation as it stands are incompatible.
39. Book 2, Episode 15: “Tales of Ba Sing Se”
A filler episode with the power to make you cry. All of the mini-stories are great and tell you something about the characters, the themes or the overarching plot.
38. Book 1, Episode 16: “The Deserter”
This episode is underrated. Aang doesn’t respect firebending and accidentally hurts Katara, despite all of his new master’s warnings. In response, Katara discovers she’s a healer and Aang uses his new understanding to trick Admiral Zhao into destroying his own fleet.
37. Book 2, Episode 3: “Return to Omashu”
Not only does this episode introduce us to the phenomenal Ozai’s angels (Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee), but it also revels in the satisfying complexity of a villain being the one to value non-benders enough to choose them as her elite fighters over fellow firebending masters. The clash with the new antagonists is amazing and Aang leaves in search of a new earthbending teacher.
36. Book 1, Episode 19: “The Siege of the North — Part 1”
When Aang returns from helping attack the many, many Fire Nation ships coming to lay siege to the Northern Water Tribe, he tells Yue: “I’m just one kid.” Yeah, Aang is all-powerful and has a grand destiny, but he is also 12. This is a show about kids doing their best and fighting to protect people because despite being kids, they don’t want to stand aside — they choose to use their powers and do the right thing. However, this reminder that all of the powerful main characters in “Avatar” are children carrying heavy burdens is heartbreaking.
35. Book 2, Episode 10: “The Library”
Sure, there’s great expositional plot development with the revelation of the Day of Black Sun that will render firebenders powerless, but now’s the time to discuss how Toph’s blindness is expertly handled. She can take care of herself and do things no one else can (metalbending) yet also needs extra help around air, water and sand. While the others might forget she’s blind at times and it’s still debilitating in some circumstances, she doesn’t let it hold her back and no one sees her as any less for it. She’s as much a protagonist as Katara or Sokka and that’s wonderful.
34. Book 2, Episode 14: “City of Walls and Secrets”
The origin of “There is no war in Ba Sing Se.” When Jet accuses Zuko of being a firebender hiding in Iroh’s tea shop, he jumps at the opportunity to duel a customer. As someone who has worked in a coffee shop: Honestly, same.
33. Book 2, Episode 18: “The Earth King”
The Gaang — four teens and preteens, and two animal companions — lay siege to the Earth King’s palace to tell him about the war with the Fire Nation. Meanwhile, Zuko goes into an angst coma because for the first time in his life he did the right thing — helped the Avatar by giving him Appa back — and his body is so shocked it literally treats it like an allergic reaction.
32. Book 2, Episode 11: “The Desert”
Where Katara actually was the Mom Friend. Aang is devastated without Appa, Toph is struggling to walk on the sand, and Sokka is literally high, so Katara holds them together. It’s both bitterly sad and offers some of the show’s best moments of levity: “Drink cactus juice. It’ll quench ya! There’s nothing quenchier.”
31. Book 2, Episode 16: “Appa’s Lost Days”
This episode about what happened to Appa after he was taken by sandbenders won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States for its depiction of animal cruelty and it absolutely deserved it.
30. Book 2, Episode 17: “Lake Laogai”
This one is about choosing your destiny. Iroh begs Zuko to consider what he wants his destiny to be; when he finds Lake Laogai and tries to steal Appa for himself, Iroh berates Zuko about how lucky he has been time and time again, as he doesn’t think his plans through. Zuko lets Appa go to Aang, and finally gives up his Blue Spirit disguise. Could this be his redemption? (No, we’re not there yet.)
29. Book 2, Episode 19: “The Guru”
This episode is mostly Aang sitting around and meditating but somehow it works? It’s a great character episode for Aang and all the moving pieces of Katara discovering Zuko, Sokka getting to see his dad, and Katara being captured by Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee is fantastic pay-off, raising the stakes for the season’s finale.
28. Book 3, Episode 1: “The Awakening”
“I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back.” Sound familiar? It’s Aang saying it this time! Aang is dismayed that the world thinks he’s dead and Zuko is hesitant when his father accepts him back into the family. Aang and Zuko are two sides of the same coin, and this flipping of motivations epitomizes why both of their arcs are amazing.
27. Book 3, Episode 2: “The Headband”
A “Footloose” homage? Yep, they went there and it is glorious. And the messages they snuck in about imperialist propaganda and Fire Nation kids not being inherently evil? Epic grey morality in a fun episode about a dance party.
26. Book 3, Episode 3: “The Painted Lady”
Another amazing Katara-centric episode about selflessness, bravery, and not turning a blind eye. The Gaang couldn’t compel the people of the village to save themselves — they took steps to help (including blowing up Fire Nation military’s supplies), but only the entire village banding together to clean the river could really solve their problems.
25. Book 3, Episode 4; “Sokka’s Master”
In this house, we respect Sokka. This episode’s A-plot is Sokka learning to wield a rad space sword, the B-plot is the other members of the Gaang lying around and talking about how much they miss Sokka, and the C-plot is Iroh getting ripped. Enough said.
24. Book 2, Episode 12: “The Serpent’s Pass”
What should be an unremarkable episode becomes lovely and incredibly significant: We see the return of Suki (sans her warrior makeup!) and Sokka deals with his guilt over Yue’s death, Aang comes to terms with his pain and grief at the loss of Appa and we finally viscerally see the struggles faced by some of the many people displaced by war. The birth of a child literally named Hope represents a moment of peace before the dangers of Ba Sing Se and the escalation of the war.
23. Book 1, Episode 18: “The Waterbending Master”
Katara literally fights the patriarchy. Does she win? Of course not, she’s never had a waterbending lesson in her life. But she stood up with all the teaching she clawed for herself and wouldn’t be told no. Chills. And that fight scene!
22. Book 2, Episode 6: “The Blind Bandit”
The introduction of Toph! Do we need to say more?
21. Book 3, Episode 8: “The Puppetmaster”
The Gaang meet Hama, who was kidnapped from the Southern Water Tribe by the Fire Nation and kept imprisoned under terrible conditions. To escape, she taught herself a horrific sub-style of waterbending: bloodbending. Remember how there are bad people in every nation? Remember how people in pain can do bad things and that isn’t okay? Wow. Wowee. Her rage against the Fire Nation people is understandable even if it’s misdirected, and bloodbending is terrifying.
20. Book 3, Episode 17: “The Ember Island Players”
When a standard show does a recap episode, they recycle old footage, maybe throw in some animated bloopers or a new voiceover. “Avatar,” on the other hand, chose to gloriously satirize itself and raise the new question that will lead us into the finale: Should Aang kill the Fire Lord?
19. Book 3, Episode 6: “The Avatar and the Firelord”
Remember The Storm? Remember how Aang and Zuko are two sides of the same coin? This episode is a great example of these themes; Zuko finds out one of his great-grandfathers started the war and another was the previous Avatar who failed to prevent it, and these two sides have always warred within him. During the scene where Iroh explains this to Zuko in his prison cell, the staging puts Iroh in a pool of light and Zuko in shadow behind the prison bars — yet another example of the incredible cinematic attention that went into this show. Finally, Zuko starts to realise honor is something you earn, not something that can be bestowed upon you.
18. Book 2, Episode 9: “Bitter Work”
Now that it’s finally time for Aang to learn earthbending from Toph, he struggles to reconcile its unyieldingness with his peaceable airbender nature. And when Zuko struggles to learn lightning-bending, everyone’s favourite angsty boi responds by yelling at God to strike him down because he’s completely fine and has no trauma. Aang begins to master earthbending when he realises the value in standing your ground and Zuko learns to redirect lightning even though he can’t produce it. This episode is underrated.
17. Book 2, Episode 13: “The Drill”
Remember, Azula was sent to bring Zuko and Iroh home. Instead, she found herself in Ba Sing Se and decided, might as well conquer the unconquerable city. And while her plan in this episode — drill through Ba Sing Se’s walls — doesn’t pay off thanks to the Gaang’s awesome teamwork, she does accomplish it in the end. Forget Ozai — Azula is the scariest antagonist in this show.
16. Book 3, Episode 7: “The Runaway”
This one is a great showcase for Katara and Toph’s relationship. Their dynamic is amazing because it isn’t “girls are catty because they must compete to be The One Cool Girl” or “girls stand next to each other instead of having conflict or meaningful interactions because Girl Power.” Their characters are almost diametrically opposed — so of course, they clash — but they value each other and pull off a badass scam. Plus: Sokka and Aang forgetting Toph can’t read.
15. Book 3, Episode 10: “Day of the Black Sun — Part 1”
Sokka chokes trying to explain his plan to the soldiers, because even the comic relief on this show has depth. But the 15-year-old is also terrifyingly competent, as he organized this invasion and brought them all together. He designed a submarine!
14. Book 3, Episode 18 “Sozin’s Comet: Part 1 — The Phoenix King”
This is a lovely, fun episode where the Gaang prepare for the end of the war and possibly the world by… throwing a beach party. It’s great. When Zuko makes them actually prepare we see Toph having a blast as “Melonlord” and, over in the Fire Nation, Ozai is preparing to take over the world. Everything falls into place as the finale ramps up.
13. Book 3, Episode 12: “The Western Air Temple”
“Hello, Zuko here.” Zuko is socially awkward, okay? His adorkably embarrassing attempts to get on the Gaang’s good side and his continued screw-ups are both necessary (because this show loves to provide an abundance of evidence that nothing comes easy to Zuko) and amazing.
12. Book 1, Episode 20: “The Siege of the North — Part 2”
This is the episode where, after kidnapping Aang, Zuko decides to fight Katara — a master waterbender — on an island made of ice surrounded by water. It goes exactly as you’d expect. Additionally, Zhao kills the moon spirit and knocks everything out of balance, leading to Yue’s heartbreaking sacrifice. When all seems lost, Aang says: “No. It’s not over.” He becomes a giant spirit monster who strikes down only those who oppose him, and Zhao chooses to die rather than let Zuko help him. Chills.
11. Book 3, Episode 13: “The Firebending Masters”
Now that Zuko has joined the Gaang, Aang and Zuko are finally in harmony with themselves and each other. So as they stand to learn the truth of firebending from the last surviving dragons, we hear the end credits swell in the middle of the episode — because we are so close to the end, and Aang and Zuko are so nearly ready.
10. Book 3, Episode 14: “The Boiling Rock — Part 1”
We’re into the top ten now and the competition is close. We get the return of Suki and Sokka dealing with his feelings of inadequacy. Plus, the origin of “That’s rough, buddy.” (Which is actually a completely reasonable response since Zuko probably doesn’t know what happened to Yue, that she was involved with Sokka, and he has the social skills of a rock.) Sokka is, again, a mastermind of planning and learns to trust himself even if he isn’t infallible.
9. Book 3, Episode 16: “The Southern Raiders”
This is an amazing Katara episode that ties up some of the biggest questions in “Avatar.” It doesn’t just deal with Katara’s grief after she lost her mother; it shows how Katara is still affected by it, how she had to become her mother’s replacement when she was still a child, and the burden and resentment that caused her to feel. Aang the pacifist monk told Katara not to look for vengeance while Zuko understood that she needed to. But Zuko has chosen to step away from defeating the Fire Lord — Aang will have to kill him. How can he?
8. Book 3, Episode 5: “The Beach”
This episode is about the villains — because they are people too, and they are kids too, worrying about their relationships or being liked or their teenage angst. The bad guys on this show have depth and it makes all of the conflict up to this point and everything that follows more meaningful. Not to mention how it’s a turning point in Zuko’s arc, as he finally inspects his feelings about choosing his sister and betraying his uncle at the end of Book 2.
7. Book 3, Episode 19: “Sozin’s Comet — Part 2: The Old Masters”
The one where all of Aang’s past lives tell him to betray his principles and kill Firelord Ozai. Aang’s peaceful nature is central to his character, but he is not weak. For standing by his values even when the whole world is telling him to give in and kill someone, the Lion-Turtle rewards him with an out (hence we forgive it for being an ex-machina). Zuko and Iroh also reunite and everyone cries, so this episode really is the culmination of everything.
6. Book 2, Episode 8: “The Chase”
Toph joining the Gaang is an adjustment, especially given that everyone is sleep-deprived as they’re on the run from Azula, Mai and Ty Lee. When they split up, we get an amazing and revealing three-way fight between Aang, Azula and Zuko. Iroh and Toph exchange wisdom, and pain is felt when Azula nearly kills Iroh. In response? With the help of the rest of the Gaang, we see water, earth, fire, and air (and boomerang!) united for the first time against a common foe. Badass.
5. Book 2, Episode 20: “The Crossroads of Destiny”
So that’s what happens when a villain attacks a character during his power up sequence. Zuko makes the ultimate wrong choice but we understand, even as we hate it. From the power move of Azula casually defeating the primary Earth Kingdom antagonist Long Feng to the amazing fight scenes, from Iroh turning his head away from his nephew to Katara bringing Aang back from the dead: This is an electrifying season finale.
4. Book 3, Episode 15: “The Boiling Rock — Part 2”
It’s amazingly cathartic when Mai betrays Azula, but when Ty Lee chooses not to stand with Azula? Even the minor antagonists make completely shocking but logical decisions and this is the beginning of Azula’s downfall.
3. Book 3, Episode 11: “Day of the Black Sun — Part 2”
They lose. In this kids show, in an important battle, the good guys lose and there are repercussions, as all of the adults return to prison. It’s the invasion of the Fire Nation capital during the eclipse that renders firebending null. Azula is the best liar and manipulator, and Zuko’s confrontation with his father is epic. Lightning represents the abuse of his father and his family — with his Uncle’s love and support, Zuko learns to let that lightning pass through him without hurting him and chooses not to take vengeance on his father. Zuko stands up to his father and tells him that he was abusive and wrong. He knows his worth, and now he’s going to do the right thing no matter the consequences. Zuko’s redemption arc is exceptional and this is a brilliant moment that shows just how far he has come.
2. Book 3, Episode 20: “Sozin’s Comet — Part 3: Into The Inferno”
Truly everything happens in this penultimate episode: A bunch of old guys take back Ba Sing Se! Toph, Suki and Sokka take over an airship by themselves! And Azula’s descent into madness is complete. She was a child prodigy who grew up under her father’s abuse and crushing expectations. Mai and Ty Lee’s betrayals broke her because she thought she was never wrong, that fear would never fail her. From her first introduction she wanted to be perfect — not “one hair out of place” — yet now the pressure has become too much. The mad queen has met her inevitable fate. “Game of Thrones” could never.
The Last Agni Kai between Zuko and Azula begins; the haunting violins are sad, because this is a tragedy. Both were abused by their parents, but without Uncle Iroh’s support this is what Azula became. And Azula attacked Katara with dishonor because she knew she couldn’t win.
1. Book 3, Episode 21: “Sozin’s Comet — Part 4: Avatar Aang”
The best episode has to be the finale. From beginning to end, everything is tied up; it’s the kind of finale every show wishes for.
With a broken leg and no weapons, Sokka holds on to Toph by her fingertips, watching as Fire Nation soldiers come to kill them. They both know they’re going to die, and hanging in the air, Toph can’t “see” anything but Sokka. They are kids. Yet when Suki saves them, they keep fighting to the end.
With Zuko injured, Katara faces Azula. Now a waterbending master herself, she outsmarts Azula by taking an insane risk, nearly taking a lightning bolt to the face. She incapacitates Azula and saves Zuko’s life.
Aang is losing until Ozai throws him into a rock and hits the scar on his back Azula gave him when she killed him — his chakras realign and he is able to reach the Avatar spirit and fulfill his potential as the Avatar. Yet when he faces Ozai, he does so as himself, not in the Avatar State. He nearly loses, but his strength of will is stronger, and he takes away Ozai’s bending. Dead, Ozai would’ve been a martyr — instead, he was defeated by a 12-year-old pacifist and is succeeded by the son he called a weakling. A true defeat.
The ending is beautiful as Zuko is crowned Firelord, witnessed by crowds from all the nations, before the extended Gaang celebrate in private, finally allowed to relax and have fun. For the first time in their lives (with the exception of 112 year old Aang), there is no more war and no reason to fear.
It was a fantastic ride.

Before BTS took over the world, they were just seven boys trying to make it through the nitty-gritty competition of South Korea’s brutal music industry, one Mnet stage at a time. Fast forward seven years to November 2020, and BTS, a.k.a. the Bangtan Boys, are back by popular demand with “BE,” an album they performed for the first time on the American Music Awards show. In honor of this latest release, take a walk down memory lane of the comebacks — a K-Pop term for album releases and their promotional cycles — that made BTS the global idols they are today.
15) “O!RUL8,2?” (2013)
2013 saw not one, but two of the most impassioned comebacks by fetus BTS, preaching about both the disillusionment and oppression of the teenage spirit. Angsty teenage Korean rap might not be your cup of tea, but the immense chaotic energy in “Attack on Bangtan” was definitely one for the books.
14) “Dark & Wild” (2014)
Their first official Korean studio album sees the Bangtan boys suffer from broken heart syndrome while they rage to a questionable synergy of punk rock and hip-hop. Sporting edgy leather and a whole lot of smoky-eye, the boys toughened up from their school days in "Danger" and "War of Hormone.”
13) “2 Cool 4 Skool” (2013)
Ah, the glorious debut. BTS came locked and loaded with what their label, BigHit Entertainment, called a “fresh take on ‘90s hip hop,” releasing hits “No More Dream” and "We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2.” An unfortunate perm and metallic muzzle masks galore made for some guaranteed faux pas. But it’s alright; there’s loads of drive and determination in those rookie eyes — along with an obscene amount of eyeliner, of course.
12) “Dynamite” (2020)
In a last attempt to bring joy to a positively dreadful year, Bangtan’s most recent English digital single “Dynamite” set off fireworks. To no one’s surprise, the track shattered all previous records with two continuous weeks atop the Billboard 100. But let’s be honest here: Seeing the boys eat ice cream in ‘70s getup made us happier than any American awards institution ever could.
11) “Love Yourself: Answer” (2018)
Only an album this ambitious could foster a whole conspiracy around band member JK’s cough. With "IDOL" serving as this compilation album’s lead single, the answer to the search for true love is finally revealed: “Loving yourself is true love.” This record, with guest appearances by Steve Aoki and Nicki Minaj, shot straight to the top of Billboard’s 200, although the netizen reception was subpar at best. One could say this one had BTS fans, otherwise known as ARMYs, “feeling just fine, fine, fine.”
10) “Map of the Soul: 7” (2020)
If the launch of global interactive art project CONNECT didn’t blow you away, worry not — MOTS: 7 includes plenty of fine artistic talent. The “Black Swan” music video attests to that, from its poetic backdrop to its accompanying “art film” choreography featuring the world-class MN dance company. Professional dancers or not, the Kinetic Manifesto “ON” had everyone drumming away in front of their mirrors all day long.
9) “Love Yourself: Tear” (2018)
2017 was a wildly successful year for the boys’ careers. It was knocked out of the ballpark, however, by the release of this record. "FAKE LOVE" smashed records abroad, and a little closer to home, the 2018 MAMAs “Anpanman” performance had lightstick ARMY Bombs glowing unapologetically bright in Japan. This album’s duality was strikingly effective; while romantic guitar riffs in “Airplane pt.2” paid homage to the global luxury lifestyle, “Magic Shop” illuminated a whole galaxy full of self-love.
8) “You Never Walk Alone” (2017)
A repackage of its predecessor, “Wings” included the addition of high-intensity bops “Not Today” and “Outro: Wings,” energizing concert performances and making this tour truly game-changing. This release also featured record-smashing track "Spring Day," which continued to chart for weeks after its release. It remains the “queen” of all BTS songs to this day, holding a special place in ARMYs’ hearts and meme pages.
7) “Map of the Soul: Persona” (2019)
“Who the hell am I?” questions RM in the “Intro: Persona” track, confronting the fame that had spread Bangtan around the world like wildfire. This mini album strives to answer that question as genuinely and authentically as possible while BTS breaches the mainstream. In the meantime, “Make It Right,” and leading single “Boy With Luv (Feat. Halsey)” open our hearts to a concept full of pink and bubbly infatuation.
6) “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt.1” (2015)
Not only did it offer heavenly visuals, this mini album also broke our hearts with the ugly beauty of young adulthood. Sure, both "DOPE" and “Boyz with Fun” had us on our feet, but "I NEED U" just hits different, as it were, with its soft vulnerability — a perfect representation of the dramatic fluidity of spontaneous youth.
5) “Love Yourself: Her” (2017)
Every career has that turning point — a clear pivotal moment that separates the before from the after. In one of their most ambitious works to date, the release of “LY: Her” turned BTS into a worldwide sensation with the hit song "DNA." Ranging from the laid-back quirky visuals in "Go Go" to the deadly Dior fits in “MIC Drop,” this EP offered a take on what being both goofy and hip looks like.
4) “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever” (2016)
There is no doubt that this one will stay young forever in our hearts. A compilation of its prequels along with the addition of new hits like "FIRE" and "Save ME," this album closed out the final chapter on the theme of youth with timeless concepts and breathtaking video clips. Echoing the generation who rebels and propels, it offered ARMYs both young and younger a satisfying end to a beautiful storyline.
3) “Wings” (2016)
Like angels sprouting wings both dark and light, BTS tackled their second Korean studio album while battling with bliss and temptation. The featured lead single "Blood Sweat & Tears" serenaded its way to the top of Gaon Digital Chart and secured the boys their first Artist of the Year Daesang at MAMAs. “21st Century Girl” and “Am I Wrong” also wrestled with themes of unrequited love, while solos like “BTS Cypher 4” ruthlessly called us out on our “LIE”s.
2) “Skool Luv Affair” (2014)
There is a reason “Boy In Luv” was performed at the 2019 MMAs — and will continue to be performed for many years to come. The final part of the school trilogy, this mini album topped the Gaon Charts with singles like "Just One Day" and “Tomorrow.” This was also BTS’s first appearance on the Billboard World Albums chart just one year after their debut. All the hype makes sense when you recall the absolute bops “Spine Breaker” and “JUMP.” “Say what you want,” but this album will never cease to shake ARMYs’ hearts.
1) “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 2” (2015)
And the 2020 Crimson ArtsRank Daesang goes to… you guessed it: the most beautiful album in BTS’s discography. With the addition of classics like “Outro : House of Cards,” "RUN," and “Butterfly,” the lyrical theme of youth extends flawlessly into a direct confrontation with new fears and insecurities. This concept blends beautifully into the music videos that would span the era of this trilogy, highlighting all of the resolve and hope in the hearts of this generation. This was also the EP that set the boys along a path of international recognition. For the first time in their careers, BTS topped the Billboard Top Heatseekers and World Albums charts for four weeks, the most by a South Korean act at the time. One look at the producing and songwriting credits on this record also shows immense personal growth by the bandmates as musicians. Not only did ARMYs get to witness the improvement of Bangtan as a group, they also saw the boys flourish as individuals, too.

Day 1: This day they bought 11 men, 6 women, and 3 girls. They bought me. I still hold onto his face.
Day 5: This day they bought 7 men, 3 women, and 4 boys. None are him.
Day 6: This day they bought 13 men and 4 women. They were very good negroes. They were ugly, dirty, and strange. It is easy to forget what you look like. I wonder in the quiet if he knows I am gone.
Day 8: This day they bought 5 men and 5 women. Few of us can speak together. It is dangerous to be alive. I wonder in the quiet if he misses me. In the dark a woman died. In the light a man died.
Day 12: This day they bought 0 men and 0 women. I look at the faces in the dark with me. They cry silently. I cry silently too, for him. I wonder in the quiet if he is gone. They bought provisions. It was an afterthought.
Day 15: This day they bought 12 men, 11 women, and 1 boy. He is not him.
Day 17: This day they bought 1 man, 4 women, and 1 boy. He is not him. I seek colors through the cracks. Blue is what I see. Blue is what I love. Blue is how I see him, the one I love. In the light a man died. They said he had not been sick 12 hours before. They said.
Day 32: We awake above the water. I do not know for how long I have been below the light. I do not know for how long I have been above the water. The floor rocks differently. The air tastes differently. I wonder in the quiet where he is. In the mystery a man died.
Day 33: They counted the lives. 175 men, 135 women, 9 boys, and 10 girls. I wonder in the quiet if he lies in the dark. I quickly stop. I do not want to wonder what I would do if I knew he did. A boy comes to me. He looks at me. I look away. He looks like a small animal. Fragile. In the mystery, one man and two women died.
Day 39: No life today. No death today. I do not know if I can smell the wretchedness or not anymore. I wonder in the quiet if his fingernails are caked too.
Day 67: Their negroes were now for the most part in health. Are we their negroes? The boy returns. He needs what I need. My son is still here. I hope.
Day 70: I do not see the boy today. Water leaks through the wood above that keeps away the light. We do not move. When still, there is no hope. When still, I wonder in the quiet if I will forget him. In the mystery, two men and one woman died.
Day 76: Water leaks through wood again and mixes with the wretchedness and makes people sick. I no longer feel sick. I need to survive for him. The trick is to hide. I hope he hides. Take from the boy and hide. I wonder in the quiet if he knows I need to survive for him. In the mystery one man died. They said he had been sick a long time.
Day 79: The boy looked sad today in my memory. I did not see him today. I was worried. He looks sad every day. I do not look at anything. I would rather see him than see myself. I do not need to see myself if I cannot see him. I wonder in the quiet if he forgets what I look like. In the dark, two men and one woman died.
Day 82: In the dark and then the early light, two men and the boy died. I see my son in his face. His face is now gone. It is thrown in the water. It is too dark to see myself. I do not want to see myself. There is no me without him. I cry loudly in the dark for him. I know he will never come again. I do not live for myself. The water entices me, but it does not invite me. I look to the blue. I cry out for his smile.
This morning, the wind is gone. I no longer wonder. There is nothing to wonder.

No one looks at me anymore. A curse threatens me and my lineage now that my body is alone. I do not know why they do not find me, why I am not lying in state in private made by those who love me. I hide beneath the hull where no one can find me. I hid because I thought I needed it. I saw a small monkey once crawl into a hole under a tree. I found him the next day, his breath was gone too. There is nowhere else to go but seek protection from the hell where protection never existed in the first place. I did not intend to be forgotten with the urine and the feces and the vomit. I am not sure if they know I am here or if they think I had fallen into the dark waters. My body is no longer hot. My breath has escaped, and it is cold. In fact, I am cold. I think my body follows the rocking of the ship. Rigor mortis hasn’t yet released its grip. My eyes are closed too. Sleep would be the comfortable explanation. Sleep would be the reality I prefer. Reality no longer exists. It never did.
No one looks at my soul either. I never expected that they could — I roam the deck as a breath, escaped from the mouth that never dissipated into the atmosphere, but my breath struggles to be released. There is no place for me to be buried. There is no family who would send me to the ancestors. They have all forgotten. My family that does not know they are my family because I left too soon. The man who is my father who isn’t my father waits for me. It’s only a matter of time until he discovers where I have gone.
They tried to wail like they knew they should even though they could not confirm I was gone, but the white men with the lashes forced them into silence before they could loosen their jaws. The wails that are unable to escape sound like sharp rocks tearing them from inside of their stomachs. My family that does not know they are my family have no means to search. They are all too big to crawl. There is one white man small enough to fit. He sometimes comes down at night with the big one and takes my sisters’ bodies. But the white men don’t search for me. My body offers nothing more for them now that my breath has escaped.
My breath suffocates as the days go on, as I wander the ship, trying to swallow the breaths of others left in the air, but nothing comes into my mouth. I follow the man, the man who I meant to be my father. He meant for me to be his son. We never spoke, but he was my father. He cried for me, but he soon stopped and instead wanders too, but he walks in his body. He was the only one who wailed for me, but he can do no more. Not until he finds me. I attempt to run towards him every time he rises to the deck to tell him through my eyes where I am, but he moves too quickly, they all do. My legs strain like they’re stuck in water. I wish they were. The white men won’t let them wonder where I am. I am left. I am lost. I am afraid. They, the white men, do not know what fear is. They never will. Their ancestors never will know what fear is. My fear evades me, floating just before me, where I can neither grasp it nor throw it off the ledge of the boat to be condemned in the wake.
I see the light in the sky beyond the clouds. The soul never dies even when the body has, but I require a transition, a transformation into a world unseen, a world of souls turned ancestors to be saved. To be remembered. They beckon, but without the Earth, I cannot escape.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Mechanical Engineering Design lecturer Michelle H. Rosen was considering how to adapt Engineering Sciences 51: “Computer-Aided Machine Design” to a remote format this fall, she knew her students would not be able to get the hands-on experience she typically builds her class around.
Normally, students in the course work in a machine shop to build robots, which will play a game at the end of the semester. With students scattered around the globe, Rosen had to find a new way for students to apply their skills.
“Instead of it being just to build a robot to play this game, we let the students actually pick what kind of problem they wanted to work on,” Rosen said. “We have some students who are building a robot that will entertain your pets, we have students building a robot that will clean your phone, we have something that will open your window blinds.”
Rosen said class staff mailed students an initial kit with materials and manufactured parts that the students designed during the semester to allow students to do the final assembly and testing themselves.
Like Rosen, thousands of Harvard faculty and students adapted their teaching and learning to a remote format this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. As Harvard College wrapped its first-ever fully virtual term Dec. 19, The Crimson asked multiple faculty, students, and administrators to reflect on the Zoom-facilitated remote semester.
While many expressed mixed feelings about the learning quality, social interactions, and in-class engagement they experienced this semester, they noted that both students and faculty are doing their best in a challenging environment.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh, who led Harvard’s fall planning committee on the remote learning experience, wrote in a Dec. 1 email to The Crimson that the fall semester was “both hard and good.”
“Students are struggling with anxiety and loss and isolation, and their instructors are struggling with those things as well,” Claybaugh wrote. “At the same time, instructors have made heroic efforts to adapt their courses and their pedagogy to remote instruction, and students have really risen to the occasion.”
While the University’s decision to abruptly de-densify its campus in the spring gave little time to shift to virtual learning, faculty spent the summer making numerous adaptations to their courses, some of which clicked with students and others of which were met with less enthusiasm. While students and faculty said they would like to see certain aspects of remote learning stick around for the long term, there are other aspects which they said they will not miss after returning to the classroom.
Lessons from the virtual fall will carry on to the upcoming spring semester, which Harvard administrators confirmed this month will also be held fully online.
While most courses do not require the level of in-person work that Rosen’s Machine Design course does, other faculty have also had to make major adjustments to their instruction modes due to the Zoom format.
Daniel T. Gilbert, who teaches Psychology 1: “Introduction to Psychological Science,” wrote in an email that he found it difficult to shift from the typical in-person lecture style that he has employed in teaching the class for nearly 20 years.
Still, he wrote that he took advantage of Zoom to invite speakers who would not have normally been able to come to Cambridge to chat with his class.
“Each week, my students read sections of a popular book in the behavioral sciences (e.g., Freakonomics, This is Your Brain on Music, The Fear Factor, Blindspot, and so on) and then the author of the book joined us on Zoom to be interviewed by me and my students,” he wrote. “A dozen or so truly amazing authors appeared in our virtual classroom this semester.”
Other instructors modified the format of their classes. George Soroka, who serves as the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Government department, said some classes in his department, particularly those which are traditionally larger lectures, experimented with “flipped classroom models.”
“You have 20 to 30 minute videos that you’re supposed to watch for homework and then you come into class and it’s not you sitting there listening to me or some other lecturer drone on for two hours but, rather, you have more of a Socratic discussion between the instructor and the students,” Soroka said.
The shift to Zoom, in addition to changing instruction method, also affected the deadline structure of some courses.
Philosophy professor Bernhard Nickel said he has made the deadlines in his course titled Philosophy 3: “The True and the Good” more flexible.
This semester, he is allowing students to submit papers without late penalties, but students must submit the prior paper and receive feedback in order to turn in the next essay.
“The only thing that incentivizes students to still try to stay with the deadlines that I set — as a way of guiding them through what I think is a good rate of work — is I do ask my students to write cover letters on their assignments where they describe what they learned from the feedback,” Nickel said.
About half of his students submitted papers according to the original deadlines, he said.
Although the shift to remote instruction was born out of necessity, some of its features will likely be kept in the future.
Students and professors alike focused on one main feature — Zoom office hours — as the largest benefit of the remote semester.
“Both last semester and this semester, I've seen way more utilization of my office hours, just because there’s so little friction in coming to a professor’s office hours as compared to having to walk across campus to the office,” Nickel said.
Rumi M. A. Khan ’21, a teaching fellow for Mathematics 18A: “Multivariable Calculus for Social Sciences,” agreed that Zoom eases barriers to lead and attend office hours.
“Normally I’d have to wear three winter coats,” he said. “Now office hours are certainly a lot less costly — I can just go to office hours in my pajamas.”
Director of Science Education Logan S. McCarty, who teaches General Education 1029: “What is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness,” said the virtual format has also expanded the time range for holding office hours.
“I could have office hours at nine o'clock at night and that's not a big problem, whereas it would be impractical to do that on campus,” he said.
McCarty said that, even when Harvard returns to in-person learning, he will continue to hold “some sort of office hours” virtually.
Office hours were not the only benefit McCarty noted. Since students were not able to conduct lab experiments this year, many science classes used online simulations in their place, which McCarty said might actually bring better results than in-person experiments.
“Students are more willing to explore and be creative in some ways with an online simulation, because they're not worried about blowing something up or destroying a piece of equipment or injuring themselves,” McCarty said.
McCarty is not alone in considering maintaining aspects from the virtual semester even after students return to the classroom — Claybaugh wrote that more than 70 percent of faculty have said they will “bring back with them some tool or teaching technique that they learned while doing remote instruction.”
Soroka, who works in the Government department, agreed, noting that the circumstances forced faculty become more “technologically savvy."
“I think overall that’s a positive thing that’s come out of this experience: we’re all thinking more about how to integrate various elements of technology better into our teaching,” Soroka said.
Though faculty and students said they appreciated some aspects of the virtual setting, they also said they believe Zoom can never fully replace the in-person experience.
“Giving lectures on Zoom is almost as painful as listening to them, so this year I had my students watch recordings of my lectures offline,” Gilbert, the psychology professor, said.
Khan, the math teaching fellow, said he coined the term “The Law of the Zoom Breakout Room” to describe a particular weakness of Zoom. Discussion occurs only in breakout rooms of very small numbers of students, he said, making it difficult to meet new people.
“As soon as you hit like five or six [students], it's just silent and nobody will want to say anything,” he said.
Khan also said he believes the shift to Zoom instruction eroded feelings of connection at the College.
“I just don’t think it’s useful or really that easy to capture big social events that are meant for socializing and fun,” he said. “Some people just don’t care about the community anymore — I think people have just checked out.”
Nickel, who teaches philosophy, said he is concerned online education will speed up an already existing phenomenon: the adjunctification of higher education in the United States. This trend is seeing universities become more reliant on adjunct faculty for teaching, rather than tenured professors.
Nickel said institutions can simply reuse lectures previously recorded by faculty on temporary appointments, while only hiring graduate students to lead discussion sections.
“Those are faculty who have term-limited appointments, who might only have a one year appointment, maybe a three year appointment, but there’s no path to tenure or any other kind of job security where you can, for instance, be pretty sure that for the next 10 years, you’re going to be in the same place, which is really disruptive if you’re trying to raise a family,” he said.
Asked about Nickel’s concerns in a Dec. 3 interview, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said FAS continues to hire tenured faculty at levels it can maintain given current financial constraints.
Students’ thoughts on Zoom mainly turned negative when asked about socializing using the virtual platform. Chung Y. “Chuck” See ’22, who lived in Adams House for the fall, said he found it more difficult to make friends with other students in classes than it would have been during a regular semester.
“Being Facebook friends, or hitting them up over the Zoom [direct message] is kind of different from making friends with them in real life,” See said.
Shraddha Joshi ’24, who spent the semester at home in Texas, felt similarly.
“I don’t really think that I have made any close friends via the Zoom environment,” she said. “It’s awkward, and it takes a lot of effort to reach out to people and constantly talk to them outside of the environment where you usually see them if that’s a class or an extracurricular.”
Joshi only had one compliment for Zoom.
“I really like the new Zoom filters — that is one thing I appreciate,” she said. “Other than that, I’m a little tired of Zoom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“At Harvard, as both an athlete and a student, it was a really positive experience. And I knew I wanted to stay involved in the game.”
In November, in the latest step of his professional career in baseball, former Crimson infielder Peter Woodfork ‘99 was named Major League Baseball’s senior vice president of minor league operations. As professional sports leagues recover from the financial difficulties brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, Woodfork will oversee the minor league teams as they aim to safely return to action in 2021.
“I think the goal is that we can play baseball and play it safely in communities across the country, play Major League and minor league. I think that's kind of our focus moving forward is to be able to, you know, get players and get the minor leagues going again,” Woodfork said.
After Harvard, Woodfork has dedicated his life to working in baseball. Before his new position as senior vice president of minor league operations, he worked in the labor relations department of major league baseball, was director of baseball operations for the Boston Red Sox, and was assistant general manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Since 2011, he has served as senior vice president of baseball operations, overseeing the umpiring department.
Although Woodfork never questioned his love of the game, he found himself accepting early on that a career as a professional baseball player was overly ambitious, and he pivoted towards other positions offered within the sport.
“It's such a tough game,” Woodfork said. “And I appreciate my time at Harvard, and the time I got to play and the opportunity. At some point, you're just not good enough, to be honest with you, on the field. And when that point came for me, at the end of my Harvard career, I think I would have loved to try to continue to play on.”
“But, my skills on the field didn't meet all the great players that actually get to play in minor league baseball. I don't think people realize how good even the lowest levels of [players] are,” Woodfork added.
Although he was unable to play professionally, Woodfork has found his work in administrative and executive roles deeply meaningful. According to Woodfork, one of the most fulfilling parts of working in baseball is seeing the impact his work has on the many fans of the sport.
“Baseball plays such a large role in society — I think you underestimate how many people it impacts as fans, as players, everyone in the organization,” Woodfork said. “So, you know, I don't think I probably envision the reach it actually has in communities and for everyone. And that's something that I’m [pretty proud to be] able to work in this game and be able to touch so many different people.”
This year, Woodfork will play a key role in ensuring minor league baseball will happen, and that it will happen safely. Although the former Crimson infielder faces a steep challenge ahead of him, he is excited by the prospect of tackling, and taking down, this challenge.
“I think, overall, it's just [about] being able to work with a different group, have a new set of challenges, to work through [them], and be able to see the reward that you have by getting [everyone] back on the field and…developing a new professional development system,” Woodfork said. “So, I think that's got me excited and, again, it's a new challenge and something I really am looking forward to.”
