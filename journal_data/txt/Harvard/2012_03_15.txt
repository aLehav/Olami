After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball is on its spring trip—and with the team, so is the Harvard University Band.
Currently in Albuquerque, N. M., the band will support twelfth-seeded Harvard as it plays the fifth-seeded Vanderbilt Commodores on Thursday.
“We’ll be playing our classic fight songs—‘Ten Thousand Men of Harvard,’ ‘Veritas,’ and ‘Harvardiana,’ as well as our normal repertoire of pop music—‘Bad Romance,’ ‘99 Red Balloons,’ and ‘Livin’ on a Prayer,’” said Drill Master Christopher M. Murray ’13, who plays the trombone.
The band—together with the basketball team, athletic personnel, and cheerleaders—took off from Hanscom Airfield in Bedford, Mass., at noon on Tuesday, bound for the New Mexico high desert.
The NCAA funds travel for twenty-nine university band members when their team advances to a tournament, providing them with free airfare, hotel accommodations, and coveted tickets to watch their team compete in the tournament.
Harvard band members are staying with the Harvard basketball players and athletic personnel, at the downtown Albuquerque Hyatt Regency.
“We were really excited to go to Albuquerque and we have been really honored by how inclusive the athletic department staff has been,” said Drum Major Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12.
“We got to watch the Selection Sunday show with the basketball team, and it has been great to enjoy spring break in a really warm place,” she added. “This has been a treat for us.”
While in Albuquerque, the band has been supporting the Crimson’s basketball players as they enter and leave the hotel throughout the day. On Wednesday, the band performed four times during the day for a total of six hours.
Yet band members said there has also been ample time for them to have fun outside of performances.
“We had the night off yesterday, and we went to a New Mexican restaurant,” Moroney said. “We also visited Sandia Peak in the Cibola National Forest.”
At tip-off on Thursday, the Harvard band will be seated underneath the basket closest to Harvard’s bench.
“This is a first for not only the basketball team—this is a big deal for the Harvard University Band,” said Murray. “We are having the time of our lives attending the tournament and we are very excited to support the Crimson tomorrow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 16, 2012, at 9:03 p.m.
Commuting from Harvard Business School to the Innovation Lab, first-year Business School student Ahmed A. Makani navigates the streets of Allston on a bicycle to cut down commuting time.
But Makani doesn’t own a bike.
Before arriving on campus, Makani purchased a membership to Hubway—a regional bike sharing program—that has since allowed him to check out bikes from stations throughout Boston.
Hubway lets citizens ride bikes without owning bicycles. A user can check out a bike from a station on a local street with the swipe of a credit card for 30 minutes to a full day, then pedal away.
As Harvard and the city of Boston both look toward sustainability, the University has begun contributing to Hubway, a growing local bike sharing program.
As of Thursday, the previously empty bike racks at Soldiers Field, Harvard Business School, and Harvard’s Longwood Medical Area in Boston will be filled with bicycles, courtesy of Hubway.
A student-run bike sharing program called CrimsonBikes, which offers a similar service, is working on its own expansion.
Both programs speak about the same goal—making it easier for Harvard community members to get around on two wheels.
REGIONAL MOVEMENT
Hubway serves Boston and plans to extend to Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville this summer. The company, which is sponsored by New Balance, is operated by Alta Bike Share, which also oversees programs in Melbourne, Australia, and Washington, D.C., and will soon expand to Chicago and New York City.
“One of the things that was compelling was that it was a public bike system that had been used before at the large scale and was a little more advanced than others,” says Nicole Freedman, director of the city of Boston’s bike program.
The effort to bolster biking has been supported in part by Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who launched an initiative in the fall of 2007 geared toward promoting sustainability and health and reducing obesity.
“Cycling is at the intersection of all of those. Boston is one of the first cities to have a full bike share program,” Freedman says.
According to Freedman, 15,000 to 20,000 people ride bikes every day in Boston, and Menino’s initiative has directly created more than 200 jobs.
Harvard jumped on the bandwagon as one of the original sponsors of the Hubway system, according to Brogan C. Graham, Hubway’s marketing manager.
Harvard has sponsored nine Hubway stations—five on the Allston and Longwood campuses and four set to open on the Cambridge campus this summer.
The University and Hubway are currently finalizing the locations for the new stations, according to Hubway General Manager Scott Mullen.
Hubway, which began operating in Boston last July, has scheduled a soft launch for this season on Thursday, when 60 percent of the stations open, including those at the Business School and in the athletic area. The entire system will open for the year on April 1.
Since its launch last year, the system has seen more than 3,700 subscribers, 30,000 casual users, and 142,000 rides. It currently offers 600 bikes in Boston. After the planned expansion, that number will jump to 1,000.
Each Hubway station is solar-powered and operates by credit card payment. The registration and pricing model is similar to the system used by Zipcar.
Each station, which is home to 10 bikes, costs $50,000 to build. “They aren’t cheap. It takes a long time and a lot of effort,” Mullen says.
Federal money, state and local grants, and private sponsorship combine to fund the stations, according to Mullen. The University declined to disclose the amount of Harvard’s sponsorship.
As a sponsor, Harvard’s logo will appear on the rear fender of each of the 90 bikes housed by its nine stations.
A bike share network has been in the works in Boston for the past four years. In 2008, the city of Boston created a committee on bike sharing that included representatives of Harvard, according to Freedman.
“Harvard was enthusiastic right from the start and really came through,” Freedman says.
“Bike sharing was on Harvard’s radar screen before our participation in Hubway,” wrote Colin B. Durrant, manager of sustainability communications at Harvard, in an email. Other programs at Harvard include the Law School’s Read & Ride program, which allows students at Harvard Law School to check out four bikes from the library, and CrimsonBikes, a student-run program launched in 2009.
STUDENT MOTION
Charles T. James ’09 purchased his first bicycle when he was a freshman at the College and soon taught himself how to repair bikes. During his time at the College, he repaired bikes for friends, who later gave him their bikes after they graduated.
In 2009, Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’67 granted James space in Leverett House, and James opened LevBikes.
The program began without any external funding. James used bikes that he had owned or that had been donated to him.
“The...model was optimized with the understanding that there was no outside funding. It made us do a lot of things which were pretty creative and innovative,” James says.
As the program expanded, James refurbished bikes to add to his fleet. James now receives abandoned bikes from House building managers, Harvard Real Estate, and the Cambridge Department of Public Works.
In May 2010, LevBikes received a grant from the Office for Sustainability that allowed it to expand. LevBikes and VeriFast cycles—a bike sharing program of the Environmental Action Committee—merged to form CrimsonBikes, which operates campus-wide.
While originally based on an honor system that trusted users to return the bikes they borrowed, the program has now added a security system with cameras in each key cabinet and an online tracking system.
CrimsonBikes operates three stations—the original outpost in Leverett, one in front of Lowell House, and one in the Quad—and plans to create stations in Dunster, Mather, Eliot, and the Yard. The program will also soon absorb the Law School’s bike sharing program.
Currently, CrimsonBikes runs under the umbrella of the Environmental Action Committee, but the group is considering becoming an officially recognized student organization—a request made by the University, according to James.
It may also team up with Harvard Student Agencies, though James worries that a partnership with the business group might be a strange match for his nonprofit program.
“I’m a little apprehensive about it,” James says. “CrimsonBikes isn’t about making money, so that’s the concern.”
TWO PROGRAMS FOR TWO-WHEELERS
James says he is not afraid of Hubway’s expansion on campus because the two organizations have different operational strategies.
Hubway only operates 8 months of the year, suspending services from November to March. CrimsonBikes decided to make bikes free of charge for long-term checkout over the winter.
CrimsonBikes offers a diverse assortment of bikes, including street and mountain bikes, while Hubway has one standard model.
“Our goal is to make biking as accessible to as many people, so it’s not just something that people do here but a lifestyle choice,” James says.
While CrimsonBikes requires a round-trip ride, Hubway riders can return a bike to any station they choose as long as there is available space.
When problems arise for CrimsonBikes users—for example, when two students book the same bike through the CrimsonBikes website or when someone takes the wrong bike—users can call for help.
“It’s more personal. If you have a problem, there are all kinds of numbers you can call,” says Matthew P. O’Leary ’13, who worked as a mechanic for CrimsonBikes over the summer.
According to James, CrimsonBikes had served 1,200 members of the Harvard community before Hubway was launched.
“I think Harvard made the right decision to support Hubway’s move. To be frank though...I’m surprised [the University hasn’t] shown the same kind of support for CrimsonBikes,” James says. “Our program is built to exist without support, but that doesn’t mean we couldn’t take advantage of it.”
When Makani moved from San Francisco to Allston, he decided it would be too costly to bring his own bike. He turned to bike sharing and has now been honored as the Hubway member who has taken the most rides.
“It allowed me to experience the city before school started,” Makani says of Hubway.
Durrant said that in addition to promoting sustainable and inexpensive transportation, he hopes the proliferation of bike sharing stations “will help bring connectivity among Harvard campuses.”
The University plans to create new bike lanes connecting the Boston and Cambridge campuses, according to Harvard’s 2011 Town Gown report published by the Planning and Project Management office.
Even as bike sharing becomes more prevalent on campus, some students will always want their own wheels.
Joey G. Wall ’14, who purchased his bike from Quad Bikes, a student-run shop that operates out of the basement of Cabot House, says, “Having my own bike is a lot easier. I use it almost every day.”

CORRECTION: March 16
An earlier version of this article said that CrimsonBikes operates two stations. In fact, the student-run bike sharing program has three stations on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The longest NCAA tournament drought in Division I is over, as the Harvard men’s basketball team is finally dancing. Now, the Crimson simply has to find a way to avoid going home early.
In its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946, twelfth-seeded Harvard (26-4, 12-2 Ivy) will face No. 5 Vanderbilt (24-10, 10-6 SEC) at 4:40 EST tomorrow in Albuquerque, N.M. in the East region’s second round.
The Commodores come into March Madness fresh off making history of their own after sweeping Georgia, Mississippi, and No. 1 Kentucky to win their first SEC tournament championship since 1951. Vanderbilt, then, must avoid a championship hangover in getting ready to face a Crimson squad that spent four more weeks ranked in the Top 25 this season than it did.
“Our challenge is to regain our focus on what lies ahead, not what lies behind us, and get ready for a very good Harvard team,” Commodores coach Kevin Stallings said.
On the whole, it has been an up-and-down season for Vanderbilt, which entered the 2011-12 campaign ranked No. 7 in the country but started just 6-4. But—as was made evident in its 61-54 upset of the Wildcats—the Commodores are loaded with talent.
Vanderbilt will pose a major challenge defensively for the Crimson, especially up front, where 6’11” center Festus Ezeli has a three-inch height advantage over Harvard co-captain Keith Wright. But Ezeli is prone to get into foul trouble—he has accumulated at least four fouls in four of his previous five games—meaning Harvard could look to feed Wright inside in an effort to get Ezeli to the bench.
But even with Ezeli out of the game, Vanderbilt has a number of weapons to turn to. The most dangerous of those is junior guard John Jenkins, who led the SEC with 19.9 points per game this season and shot 44.8 percent from long range.
“I’ve had a chance to peak in on different games Vandy has played this season,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “They’re a veteran team, a team that can score. [They’re] very athletic.... I knew right away how challenging this matchup would be.”
Senior Jeffrey Taylor will pose another threat to the Crimson. A quick, athletic forward who is averaging 16.4 points per game, Taylor will look to help the Commodores take its NCAA tournament opener, something they have failed to do in each of their last three Big Dance appearances.
Those three losses came at the hands of No. 12 Richmond last season, No. 13 Murray State in 2010, and No. 13 Siena in 2008. In 2012, the Crimson hopes it will be the next double-digit seed to upset the Commodores.
“[Vanderbilt] has been built for an opportunity to make a deep run with their experience, their balance, and their athleticism,” Amaker said. “I think they’re a team that, having come off a few early round losses in the past, will be very motivated, so I’m hopeful we can match those things.”
To do so, Harvard will need Wright and junior forward Kyle Casey to stay out of foul trouble while hoping its best perimeter shooters—sophomore Laurent Rivard, freshman Corbin Miller, and co-captain Oliver McNally—are on early and often. The Commodores shot nearly 40 percent from deep as a team this season, and Harvard could have trouble keeping up offensively if the Commodores are shooting well.
Thus, the Crimson will have to rely on its defense—third in the nation in points per game allowed—to slow Vanderbilt down, and to try to turn the game into a low-possession battle.
“I saw [Harvard] play part of one game, and Florida State couldn’t even come up with a good shot against them,” Stallings said. “So they must be pretty good defensively because last time I checked Florida State’s pretty good.”
The Seminoles, whom the Crimson beat at the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in November, are also in the East region as the No. 3 seed, behind No. 1 Syracuse and No. 2 Ohio State. But rather than speculating on potential matchups, Harvard is simply taking things one step at a time.
“We have a drive and a motivation to continue to achieve our goals,”  Casey said. “We’re going to go in confident and play our game, and stick  to who we are, and I think the outcome will speak for itself.”
Another interesting storyline emerging from tomorrow’s contest revolves around the two squads’ recruiting duels over the past few years. Casey turned down an offer from Vanderbilt to attend Harvard, while the Commodores’ Rod Odom and Shelby Moats, along with Ezeli, strongly considered the Crimson.
But those decisions are in the past, and both squads are now looking to end individual streaks of tournament egregiousness. The winner will face either No. 4 Wisconsin or No. 13 Montana in the third round, and if the Crimson can get past that point, it will get to play in its own backyard with the East region's Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight games being held at Boston’s T.D. Garden.
“We walk into every game thinking and believing that we can win,” McNally said. “We're going to face a really talented team, but we're not just happy to be here. We're here to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now, everyone has heard the news. For the first time in 66 years, Harvard men’s basketball will be making an appearance in the NCAA tournament. And on Sunday night, the Crimson received its seeding: 12th in the East region. In its opening round, Harvard will take on fifth-seeded Vanderbilt on Thursday.
History has been made. The curse of ESPN3 has been broken. A new era of Ivy League basketball has supposedly begun. But did the Crimson get cheated along the way?
According to some NCAA experts, sportswriters, and coaches, the answer is yes.
As recently as Saturday afternoon, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi placed Harvard in the No. 10 position of the Midwest region. This seeding would have pitted the Crimson against Gonzaga, a team that Lunardi correctly positioned at the No. 7 slot. Similarly, CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm also predicted the Crimson at No. 10.
Yale men’s basketball coach James Jones attributed Harvard’s drop in the brackets to the team’s lack of viewership throughout the season.
"What you find is that not a lot of people on the selection committee actually watch a lot of Harvard basketball games," Jones said. "That’s what hurts us, as a league, more than anything else—that the people on the committee are unaware of our level of play. I think that if Harvard were able to be seen a lot by other people on the committee, they would have thought more favorably of the team."
Jones stated that because several of Harvard’s statistics—such as its RPI of 34—are on par with other more highly ranked teams, this lack of viewership was the only possible explanation for the 12th slot that the squad received.
"By virtue of what Harvard’s RPI was, you’d expect their seeding to be a little higher," Jones explained. "Somewhere like an eight, nine, or 10. This whole seeding isn’t an exact science, and sometimes you’re going to have situations where a team, so to speak, gets screwed or given a lower seed because of that eye test."
The New England Sports Network took to the polls to gather fans' thoughts about Harvard’s seeding. In the online vote, 41.6 percent sided with Jones, believing that Harvard deserved a more favorable seed, while only 17.6 percent of the voters thought that the Crimson lucked out in its placement and should have been ranked lower.
Kyle Smith, the Columbia men’s basketball coach, does not think that the Crimson’s seeding was an accident. He believes that there is an inherent bias against Ivy League teams.
"I have been waiting [to discuss this] for a long time," Smith said. "It seems like it’s okay to dismiss us because we’re smart guys and the non-scholarship factor, but it’s really a disservice to our student athletes. I think they work just as hard as other programs—it affects us, it hurts everyone.  It’s important for our league, in order to get better, to have opportunities to advance in the NCAA tournament."
Smith continued by reinforcing Jones’ views on the statistical factor of the seeding, emphasizing the discontinuity between how Harvard and other teams with similar RPI’s were placed.
"If Harvard’s RPI was 34, they should’ve been a nine seed," Smith stated. “We were hoping for a 10, but they should’ve been eight or nine just based on the numbers. Especially since, for the rest of the bracket, they really were consistent basing seeding on these RPI numbers.”
Outside of the Ancient Eight, some, like ESPN’s AJ Mass, have also concluded that Harvard should have received more favorable seeding. Annually, for each team, Mass puts together what he calls the “Atomic Mass,” which assigns a team a certain number of points for its performance over the season and takes into account difficulty of schedule, road versus home games, and the other factors that the NCAA uses to decide its at-large bids. The greater the mass, the worse that team should, according to the analyst, be ranked. From there, Mass assesses where teams actually should be seeded in contrast to their actual ranking.
On this scale, the Crimson totaled an Atomic Mass of 230. According to this system, that should have earned Harvard a No. 8 seed, and so, Mass stated, the Crimson is actually one of thirteen teams that are likely to pull off an upset.
"Yes, Vanderbilt just beat seemingly invincible Kentucky in the SEC championship game [on Sunday afternoon],” Mass wrote. “However, we're always a bit worried when a team is coming off such an emotional high. Add to the mix that there always seems to be a No. 12 that does indeed shock the world, and the fact that Harvard is one of the top defensive teams in the NCAA, and we're going Crimson."
But according to Boston Globe writer Bob Ryan, this upset victory is much easier said than done. For Ryan, the tournament is not as much about seeding but about matchups. And in his opinion, it does not look good for this year’s representative from the Ivy League.
"The 12 seed doesn’t bother me as much as the sheer bad luck of the nature of the opponent," Ryan said. "I would’ve preferred them to play any of the other fives—Vanderbilt is a dreadful matchup, the worst that Harvard could have had. I would’ve said the same thing if Harvard had drawn a 10 seed and had played Vanderbilt as a seventh seed."
But when compared to other Ivy League champions from years past, Harvard’s seeding may not have turned out so poorly after all. In 2011, Princeton was placed in the No. 13 slot. The year before that, Cornell was seeded at 12 but managed to make an improbable run to the Sweet 16.
This may be attributed to the inherent lack of difficulty in an Ivy League schedule compared with those of schools in more prominent leagues, such as the Big 12 or Big East. Without the continually tough matchups that are present in those conferences, Ivy League teams will never compare to other teams in the “Strength of Schedule” category that the NCAA uses to help determine seeding.
Ryan, for one, believes that the difficulty-of-schedule category may have actually helped the Crimson in its seeding this year.
"Harvard is now not shying away from playing people," Ryan said. "Obviously, the great feather in Harvard’s cap was their win over Florida State [in November]. Granted that was on a neutral court and was seemingly eons ago, but it happened, and it’s real, and there was nothing fluky about it."
"I can just hear the committee members sitting around and saying, ‘Well they beat Florida State, we have to give them a 12," Ryan added. "They can’t just go on number crunching."
Despite the No. 12 ranking, not all statistics are against Harvard. In NCAA history, the five-versus-12 matchup is notorious for producing upsets. In the last decade of March Madness alone, all but one tournament included a 12 seed defeating its higher-ranked opponent.
And for local Harvard fans, there is another way in which the 12th seed could be considered a blessing. If the Crimson manages to beat both Vanderbilt and the winner of the Wisconsin-Montana matchup, fans will be able to see their team live only miles from campus, at the TD Garden in Boston, for the Sweet 16. This scenario would not have been possible if Harvard had been granted the No. 10 seed in the Midwest region like many predicted.
Despite the possible short-term benefits and potential upsets, for some Ivy coaches, it is undeniable that a change must be made for the long-term benefit as well as health of their league. If not, Ivy postseason play may remain as stagnant as ever.
"It really is disabling our ability to promote our league and the teams we have,” Smith concluded. “As the Ivy League, we have some advantages in other areas, so people may feel, 'They’ll be okay, they’re getting a good education.' But there is a difference. As an athlete, you believe that this is one of the only venues in life where the outcome will be the most fair, where you work hard, and supposedly the best man or woman will win. So I’m not asking for a better opportunity, I’m asking for a fair opportunity so that these guys to get a chance."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot changed for Jeremy Lin ’10 and the New York Knicks on Wednesday. For starters, the team’s head coach, Mike D’Antoni, resigned. And for the main course? The team won its first game since February, defeating the Portland Trailblazers in resounding fashion, 121-79.
The Knicks led by 26 at halftime and, despite getting outscored in the third quarter, completed a 40-point fourth period to earn the 42-point victory.
"I think everyone was obviously very emotional, but we sat down and said, 'This is where we want to go, and this is what we had to do to get there,'" Lin told reporters after the contest. “We came out with a lot of energy...more than we have in a long time."
This energy paid off. New York forced its opponent to commit 27 turnovers and had five players with at least 16 points. J.R. Smith and Steve Novak, two bench players, combined for 43 points, while backup point guard Baron Davis added 10 assists to the group’s efforts.
Lin, however, continued to struggle despite his team’s new found success. The Harvard alum took only four shots on the night; he made two of those attempts along with two free throws for a total of only six points. And though he managed to assist on six baskets, he also continued his streak of high-turnover games, giving the ball up, again, six times.
As emphasized in an article by Allen St. John of Forbes.com, D’Antoni’s resignation may prove to be detrimental for the second-year guard. Lin, a player who thrived in the free, fast-paced, high-energy system of his former coach, may not shine quite so brightly in an offense with more strict, half-court sets.
Following the game, Lin tweeted his thanks to the coach who gave him his true start in the league.
"Glad to get a win! A huge thank you to coach dantoni for everything he did for the team and me!! Truly a class act who will be missed!"
Only time will tell whether the end of the D’Antoni era also marks the end of Linsanity. As D’Antoni’s playing of Lin back on Feb. 5 may have dragged out the coach’s time with the Knicks until Wednesday, Lin fans may want to hold their breath to insure that this new direction of the organization does not also render the guard Lineffective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Depending on whom you ask, the Harvard men's basketball team will enter its second-round matchup against Vanderbilt Thursday as the five- to six-point underdog.
Last week, the Commodores made history by knocking off the tournament’s top-seeded Kentucky to win its first SEC tournament in 61 years. The Crimson will end its own long drought in the Thursday matinee—the last time Harvard made the NCAA tournament, FDR ’03 had just finished his third term as president of the United States of America.
Some independent models give an idea of the Crimson’s chances of winning. Ken Pomeroy gives the squad a 33-percent chance of advancing, and a nine-percent chance of reaching Sweet 16. The ELO rubric, which takes both winning percentage and strength of schedule into account, predicts similar figures. With a few conversions, the model is revealed to pick Harvard’s winning its first game 33 percent of the time and its first two 10 percent of the time.
The New York Post has the Crimson’s chances of winning the whole thing at 300/1, whereas it calculates Vanderbilt’s chances at 40/1. The other four potential twelve seeds have an identical 300/1 shot at taking home the whole thing. The ranking puts Harvard’s prospects as the 45th best out of the field of 68.
But don’t be discouraged by these numbers Crimson Crazies. The Post also has Harvard among the 10 teams they believe can make a Cinderella run.
In addition, both teams are no strangers to the underdog role this season. After going 10-6 within the league during the regular season, Vanderbilt’s chances were pegged at 6/1 by the Huffington Post to take the SEC crown. Harvard overcame even more drastic odds, emerging victorious in November in an eight-team Battle 4 Atlantis field that included both No. 4/4 Connecticut and No. 20/22 Florida State.
If the Crimson can pull it out and survive this weekend, it will be coming home to Boston for the Sweet Sixteen next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—Despite their historic accomplishments, the three members of the Harvard men’s basketball class of 2012 have left one more significant program milestone in the hands of future generations: a postseason victory.
Nine days after a Penn loss clinched the Crimson’s first-ever outright Ancient Eight title, Harvard (26-5, 12-2 Ivy) fell to Vanderbilt, 79-70, in the second round of the NCAA tournament Thursday afternoon.
Sophomore wing Laurent Rivard had a team-high 20 points on 6-of-7 shooting from three for the 12th-seeded Crimson, which has never won a postseason tournament game in five tries.
But co-captains Keith Wright and Oliver McNally, along with center Andrew Van Nest, will ultimately be remembered for having brought a much-maligned program out of the doldrums of college basketball.
Coach Tommy Amaker’s first crop of recruits won 94 total games while establishing a lengthy list of “firsts”: as juniors, the school’s first-ever Ivy League championship, and a season later, its first NCAA tournament appearance in 66 years.
“We made the tournament. We wanted to advance. That was obviously the ultimate goal,” McNally said. “But for players coming in, this is a big deal, and we get a lot of credit…. We were coming in to build a program from the ground up, and that’s exactly what we did.”
Junior guard John Jenkins scored 27 points to help No. 5 seed Vanderbilt (25-10, 10-6 SEC) stave off a late Harvard rally and snap an unlucky NCAA tournament streak of its own.
“I thought we were going to come back—it’s well-publicized that Vandy’s lost in the first round the last three out of four years,” McNally said. “So we knew if we were hanging around, we’d put that thought in their head and see what happened.”
Now having avoided their fourth opening-game loss during March Madness in five years, the Commodores move on to the third round of the East Regional, where they will face No. 4 seed Wisconsin on Saturday.
Vanderbilt’s veteran lineup had no trouble carrying over the momentum from its win over No. 1 Kentucky in Sunday’s SEC tournament championship, nearly turning Thursday’s academically prestigious matchup into a rout.
A three by junior Christian Webster gave Harvard a 20-17 lead with 5:28 to go in the first half, but Vanderbilt closed the period on a 16-3 run to hold a 33-23 advantage at intermission.
“I think we got sloppy with the ball offensively,” McNally said. “Also, I don’t think we did a good job rebounding the ball defensively. It’s tough because our big guys had to square up with some monsters down there.”
One such player was Commodore senior center Festus Ezeli, who had a game-high six rebounds in the first period and finished with 11 boards along with four blocks.
The 6'11 big man and his teammates proceeded to hit their first seven shots of the second half and opened up an 18-point lead on a fast-break dunk by senior forward Jeffery Taylor with under eight minutes to play.
“Their ability to hit threes…and certainly their size and strength and athleticism [are] something to be reckoned with,” Amaker said.
Juniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry—who had 13 and 12 points on the day, respectively—reeled off seven straight points to cut the deficit to 11 at the 6:15 mark, but Harvard found itself back in a 16-point hole one minute later.
Then it was Rivard’s turn to keep his squad in contention. The only underclassman starter for either team drained two three-pointers in a 24-second span to make it 68-57, Vanderbilt.
“He torched us in the second half like nobody’s business,” Commodores coach Kevin Stallings said. “That kid was spectacular today.”
On his squad’s next possession, McNally drove into the lane and passed it to a cutting Curry, who hit a finger roll with 3:30 left to bring the Crimson within single digits for the first time in the period.
After a Curry layup again brought Harvard within nine one minute later, the second-team All-Ivy guard forced a turnover on the ensuing inbounds play.
Casey and Wright combined to make four free throws on their squad’s next two possessions, closing out a 14-3 Harvard run that cut the Vanderbilt advantage to 70-65 with 1:51 to go.
But following a 1-of-2 performance at the free throw line by Taylor, the ball inadvertently squirted out of Curry’s hands on the left wing. A leaping McNally attempted to throw it off Commodore guard Dai-Jon Parker along the sideline, but the ball stayed in play long enough for Parker to chase it down.
The Ivy League’s lone tournament representative was then forced to foul. Though Vanderbilt had gone 13-of-22 from the free throw line up to that point, Jenkins hit six free throws in the final minute to seal a Commodore victory and send the Crimson home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the Harvard men’s basketball team’s recent success, there has always been one knock against the Crimson: When the pressure is on, Harvard folds.
The criticism is not unfounded. Take, for instance, the Crimson’s 3-8 record in games televised on the ESPN family of networks over the past three seasons. Or look at Harvard’s embarrassing last two postseason appearances: a 93-71 loss to Appalachian State in the first round of the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament and a 71-54 defeat at Oklahoma State on national television in the National Invitation Tournament last March.
So with the nation’s attention turned to the Crimson this past week leading up to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946, some worried that Harvard would once again fail to show up when the lights went on.
The Crimson’s demeanor when it first took the court at The Pit on the campus of the University of New Mexico for Thursday’s second-round matchup with Vanderbilt didn’t do much to allay those worries.
Even the introductions for the Crimson’s starters didn’t come with the same dose of swagger Harvard fans are accustomed to seeing; junior Kyle Casey’s chest bump with co-captain Keith Wright looked more like a love tap.
The Crimson’s play out of the gates did not help much, either. Junior point guard Brandyn Curry, who entered Thursday’s game ranked 19th in the country in assist-turnover ratio, coughed up the ball twice in the game’s first 2:24. And after hanging around for the first 15 minutes, Harvard quickly began to let the contest slip away.
The 12th-seeded Crimson surrendered a 13-3 run to close out the first half, going into the break down 10, 33-23. And after a six-point swing less than a minute into the second frame—Casey missed a dunk on one end and Vanderbilt’s John Jenkins knocked down an and-one three-pointer on the other—it looked like Harvard was ready to continue its trend of disappointing post-season losses.
Two seasons ago, the Crimson, playing in its first postseason tournament in more than 60 years, opened up a 12-point first-half lead on the road at Appalachian State in the opening round of the CIT.
But Harvard imploded 10 minutes in, losing its advantage before the end of the first half and falling behind by double figures five minutes into the second. The final buzzer brought an end to the 22-point loss, the Crimson’s second-largest of the season.
One year later, Harvard fared even worse in its first NIT appearance. Oklahoma State went up by 10 nine minutes in, and the Crimson was unable to pull within single digits the rest of the way, eventually falling by 17.
So when Jeffery Taylor’s layup with 15:47 to go put Vanderbilt up by 16, Harvard was in a familiar position.
But unlike in each of the past two seasons, the Crimson punched back. Casey knocked down his lone triple of the game with 6:53 remaining, and Curry brought the Crimson within 11 one possession later off a layup.
Thanks to some clutch three-pointers from sophomore Laurent Rivard and some timely free throws from Casey and Wright, Harvard pulled within five, 70-65, with 1:51 to go.
That was as close as the Crimson would get, as Harvard fell, 79-70, but a two-possession ball game with less than two minutes to play against a team fresh off a win over No. 1 Kentucky was more than many expected.
“I was really impressed with the effort that our kids gave to make the game interesting toward the end,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I can’t say enough about the fight that we had and the effort that we put forth to stay relevant in this particular basketball game.”
The Crimson fans that traveled to Albuquerque, N.M., certainly were not hoping for just a moral victory, but given the Crimson’s recent postseason performances, perhaps they shouldn’t be too disappointed.
“I think we battled very hard and didn’t just give in when we could have given in,” said Casey, who scored seven of his 13 points in the last 7:28. “We weren’t going to stop fighting until the final buzzer rang.”
And when the NCAA tournament comes to a close, the Crimson’s nine-point loss to an experienced and athletic Vanderbilt team that entered the year ranked No. 7 in the nation might not look too shabby.
“I think they have all the pieces to the puzzle for an outstanding team, as we’ve seen, and certainly to make a deep run here in the tournament,” said Amaker, though the Commodores fell to Wisconsin, 60-57, on Saturday.
So while the Crimson’s first NCAA tournament run in 66 years may have ended faster than you can say “Festus Ezeli,” Harvard fans should remember that Thursday’s game, just like each of the past five seasons, was a step in the right direction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—In each of its last three trips to the NCAA tournament, Vanderbilt entered its opening matchup favored to win. And three times in a row, the Commodores fell short of expectations, dropping games to 12-seeded Richmond, 13-seeded Murray State, and 13-seeded Siena in 2011, 2010, and 2008, respectively.
But Vanderbilt—fresh off of its first SEC championship since 1951—managed to avoid what would have been a fourth straight upset, beatinging the Harvard men’s basketball team, 79-70, at The Pit on the campus of the University of New Mexico.
“We’ve had a good amount of negativity about our first-round losses,” Vanderbilt coach Kevin Stallings said. “Our guys have had to listen to a lot of that. I’m really proud of them for not only what they did last weekend [at the SEC tournament], which was quite an accomplishment, but also what they were able to do today.”
With the win, the Commodores earned a chance to take on No. 4 seed Wisconsin—who handily defeated Montana just before the Crimson and the Commodores took to the court—for a shot at the Sweet Sixteen. On Saturday, the Badgers advanced with a 60-57 win.
Harvard—playing in its first Big Dance in 66 years—dropped to 0-3 all time at the tournament. And for the Crimson, Thursday’s game marked a bittersweet moment in a historic season.
“This is a dream to a lot of us, to be in this moment, to have this moment here,” said junior point guard Brandyn Curry. “It was a great experience, just unfortunately losing’s never good. It’s a tough loss.”
SHOOTING STARS
Before Thursday afternoon’s contest in Albuquerque, sophomore guard Laurent Rivard had not scored in double digits since Harvard beat Columbia at Lavietes Pavilion on Feb. 4. But the Crimson sharpshooter came alive against the Commodores, knocking down six-of-seven attempts from deep on the way to a team-high 20 points.
“[Rivard] hit some tough shots and bailed us out at the end of the shot clock a few times,” junior forward Kyle Casey said. “He was big for us today, keeping us in the game and keeping us close.”
Rivard’s shooting mark ties his season high in both three-pointers made and total points.
“I hadn’t seen somebody get that hot in a long time,” said Vanderbilt shooting guard John Jenkins, who led the SEC in scoring this season. “He was making them from everywhere, no matter how deep they were and [with] the shot clock going down.... It was very impressive.”
But while the sophomore was hot from long range, Harvard’s other shooters struggled to a combined 3 for 17 from deep.
Vanderbilt was led, perhaps unsurprisingly, by Jenkins, who finished with 27 points. The 6’4” shooting guard went 7 for 12 from the field and three of eight from three.
“He’s one of the best shooters in the country, and we saw that,” Curry said. “He hit some very tough shots. We were there, right in his face, but that’s what great shooters do, they hit tough shots. And that’s what he did.”
Jenkins—who entered Thursday’s contest averaging 19.9 points per game—had some help in the scoring department from seniors Jeffery Taylor and Brad Tinsley, who combined for 31 points. Vanderbilt finished the game shooting 54.3 percent from the field.
RUN AWAY LOVE
After nearly 15 minutes of play, Harvard was three points ahead of the Commodores.
But a 10-0 run starting with 5:03 left to play in the first half gave Vanderbilt a commanding lead as the clock wound down. Curry hit a three-pointer with 16 seconds to play to break Harvard’s scoreless streak. But Tinsley pushed his team’s lead back up to 10 with a three of his own just before the half.
“That’s something we’ve been working on all year, ending halves right and starting halves right,” Casey said. “It’s just something to work on for the future. I’m not too sure what happened, but it wasn’t a good sign.”
Vanderbilt rode its momentum into the second frame, making every shot it attempted in the first 5:35 and stretching its lead to as many as 18 points with 7:49 to play.
But Harvard went on a scoring streak of its own as the game drew to a close, outscoring Vanderbilt, 19-12, in the final five minutes of play.
“We’re a group that never gives up,” Curry said. “We weren’t going to fold. We could have just [given] in, but that’s not what this team is about, that’s not what we do. I’m proud of the way the guys put it on the line and tried to come back.”
Although co-captain Keith Wright shrunk the gap to five points with two free throws with 1:51 to play, the late comeback effort ultimately fell short.
“We feel like we belong here,” Casey said. “We got some shots to fall and we got real close, but just couldn’t finish it up.”

When Professor of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics Michael P. Brenner debuted his "Science and Cooking" course in September 2010, 600 students showed up to the opening lecture, forcing the course to be lotteried. Harvard's enthusiasm for cooking hasn't diminished, but it seems like certain freshmen could still use a few lessons.
According to an email from the Freshman Dean's Office sent to the freshman class, four fire alarms have gone off in Greenough and Matthews since the beginning of spring break, necessitating evacuations and visits from the Cambridge Fire Department.
As the email, penned by the Dean of Crimson Yard Catherine R. Shapiro, made clear, there's more on the line than burnt toast and dignity. Her email stated, "If we have more incidents like this, we will probably have to close the kitchens at least for the duration of Spring Break." A catastrophe indeed, especially for those who were hoping to make their own Irish stew for upcoming Saint Patrick's Day.
However, these measures are a last resort; Shapiro's email included six tips for students hoping to indulge their gastronomic tendencies. Some of these suggestions seemed to come from health food cookbooks—number three simply read, "don't deep fry." Others, like the one that condemned leaving the kitchen and "going back up to your room, stepping out to make a phone call, or watching the TV in the common rooms" were just specific enough to hint at the causes of these four fire alarms.

Margot Leger '13 is a runner, a lover of words, and a creative fundraiser. This April she is combining two things that most of us have probably only ever considered doing—running a marathon and getting a henna tattoo. Leger, fundraising in support of the American Medical Athletic Association (AMAA), is asking friends and family to donate words, at five dollars apiece, that she will henna onto her body before she runs the distance.
A junior from South Africa, Leger, who is also a Crimson video editor, started running seriously last summer and made the decision to participate in her first marathon as a member of the Harvard College Marathon Club. While running, she hopes to support the AMAA by fundraising in a way that will raise both money and visibility for the cause. "It's all about creating awareness for living a healthy lifestyle and showing youth the importance of living healthily," Leger said.
In addition to combining her passion for running, words, and art, she sees this project as a creative communication tool in her personal life. "It's a really nice way to reconnect with people who I've lost touch with from different parts of the world."
This enthusiastic runner is encouraging friends and family to donate words or whole sentences to her cause, meaning that phrases like "see the world on foot" can become a part of her tattoo repertoire for just $25.
Canyon S. Woodward '15 donated "FOP 61," a tribute to his FOP group of which Leger was one of the two leaders. "It's an inspiring cause and I think she's definitely got the motivation to pull it off," Woodward said.
Some other creative donations include a yoga chant, part of the South African National Anthem, and phrases in other languages. To learn more about the "Moving Marathon Masterpiece" visit the Facebook page and check out her video as well. Go Margot!

For those of you who missed out on the big game (spoiler alert: Harvard didn't do well)—here's a roundup of some of the tweets that kept the twittersphere buzzing Thursday afternoon:
Reality Check? This is a pretty big deal—or as @harvardhoochies put it, "Harvard wants this win against Vandy as much as we want Harvard husbands." So what's our consolation prize? According to @The_REAL_DonDon: "It's okay Harvard, go back to being doctors and lawyers and stuff." #tootrue
 
Math nerds—on and off the court? Perhaps it is all in the numbers—at least according to @BenSicoli who instructed that Harvard "must create an algorithm to win this game or my bracket is screwed." However, at least some people understood that this was basketball and not a math test. @WriterJane74 later tweeted "Dear TV guys, please stop making nerd jokes about #Harvard, and admit the boys can play." #smartball
 
Our Cheerleaders? Apparently our cheerleaders have more than just their smarts going for them—as @ShelleyLeeGreen tweeted "Rooting for Harvard because their cheerleaders actually look normal...#HeyHeyHarvard." But don't be fooled. Our cheerleaders are nowhere close to being underdogs given tweets like @DoggyStyleRadio's that unequivocally declared: "Gonna go on record and say that the Harvard cheerleaders are hot." #iseeyouharvard
 
The Bottom Line? In making it to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946, Harvard's basketball team reminded the rest of the world (and all of us as well) that Harvard students can play ball—and do just about anything else—too. #GoCrimson
