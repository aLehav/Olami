After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 19 2021, at 12:30 a.m.
Among the Anishinaabe people, there is a terrible haunt.
With dizzying blizzards and vicious threats of frostbite, the winter months of the Great Lakes turn fruitful environments into wastelands. The howl of winds sweep over valleys that were pregnant with life just months before and dares anyone, or anything, to suggest an existence beyond the cold grip of frost. Where there was birth, death now takes residence and summer songs are replaced by the groans and echoes of empty stomachs.
Adding to the sad soliloquy are whispers of a gluttonous monster. Between nervous exhales, timid murmurs of the dreadful Windigo travel across the frozen landscape.
As Robin Wall Kimmerer describes in “Braiding Sweetgrass,” during the time of year appropriately named the Hunger Moon, stories about the Windigo warn of a monster that stalks through the north forest looking to kill and eat the unfortunate humans it stumbles upon. There’s a much deeper meaning to this story, however, than to just deliver a mere spook to its audience.
In the generations before our modern era, starvation was apt to knock on the door of the First People during the ghastly Hunger Moon. Snowfall would destroy food resources and hunters would find no game, leaving families with nothing but desperation to stomach at the end of each day. During times of such scarcity, it went without saying that greed was the forbidden sin.
For those lost in the confusing depths of isolation and desperation, it wasn’t uncommon for rumors of cannibalism to flit between families. It was by this heinous act that a Windigo was made: By eating one of their own, an Anishinaabe person was transformed into a tall, gaunt beast damned to wander in starvation for eternity. Characterized by insatiable hunger, the Windigo suffers from greater cravings with each meal it consumes. Forever lost in a cycle of longing, it goes eternity unable to satisfy its hunger or quench its thirst. As the legend goes, so desperate is the Windigo for more that it has chewed off and eaten its own lips trying to momentarily appease its appetite. As we can imagine, however, this unfortunate act too must’ve only made the beast hungrier.
With our modern conveniences, we’re lucky not to have death knocking on our door with the turn of the seasons. Regrettably, I don’t believe this means that gone are the days of the Windigo; regardless of our innovations, it seems humanity’s demons always evolve alongside us.
Reflecting on this tale, I feel it was never cannibalism that truly defined the Windigo. The root of its existence extends beyond gnarly teeth and pale skin. The real monster that the Anishinaabe are warning of here is greed and over-consumption. It’s harboring infinite desire, and then all the things a person is willing to do in an effort to indulge it. Leave simpler ghost stories to be told around the campfire — this one is for the adults in the room. Where there is humanity there is greed, and where there is greed, there is the Windigo.
Our modern-day consumption habits have me fearful that we may be unearthing this monster once again.
I hear its growl as I pace the aisles of the grocery store; its cold breath chills my spine as I pop open the doors of the freezer section each week. I find myself surrounded by plastic-wrapped meats and meals, lost in the kaleidoscope of colorful packaging. There’s enough for today, enough for tomorrow, enough for all time, so it seems. And so I take more than I need and with it all I take packaging that will long outlast me in its time on Earth.
I could smell the rotting flesh on its breath last weekend as I walked down Fifth Avenue. Looking around, I had to watch my step on the New York City sidewalks to avoid the clutter of discarded coffee cups and the other miscellaneous junk of a city spiraling in its consumerism. Bags in tow, I held my breath as I tried to contemplate how I’d fit my new clothes in my already cramped closet.
I fear I even felt one brush by me on campus a few weeks ago. During a conversation about future job opportunities and varying salaries, I couldn’t help but feel its foreboding presence. I swear, it must’ve only been right around the corner.
However many times I think I’ve felt a Windigo presence, there was only one time I know for certain that I saw the real thing. The sighting happened during a bad thunderstorm a few months ago while I was home in Florida. I was passing the time satiating myself on Netflix, watching episode after episode to pass the time. I had been indulging myself for hours in entertainment when the power flickered off.
By the light of the moon shining through my window, staring back at me through the reflection of my screen were two beady eyes and a face devoid of emotion. As I tilted my head, it tilted its own.
Moments later, the electricity was back and I resumed my episode.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has its own vernacular — Harvard Speak — where majors are called “concentrations,” RAs are referred to as “proctors” by freshmen and “tutors” by upperclassmen, and everything has an acronym. One of the more universally used buzzwords at Harvard is a term that I learned before stepping foot onto Harvard’s campus: impostor syndrome.
With Harvard’s admissions rate being as low as it is, it’s hard not to occasionally become consumed by this looming fear that the admissions committee somehow made a mistake, and that the congratulatory message we all received on Ivy Day was addressed to the wrong person — that we’re not meant to be here. That we’re merely impostors.
For a long time, that’s what I believed impostor syndrome to be: a feeling of inadequacy, a fear of not being “good enough.” But I came to learn that impostor syndrome is so much more than that.
In my quest to stop feeling like an impostor and start feeling like a true Harvard student, I began to alter myself to fit into this “Harvard-student mold” that I had imagined in my head. And suddenly, without even realizing it, I became an entirely different kind of impostor: an impostor of myself.
In high school, my goal was clear — college. It was the thing I had been working to achieve my entire life. It’s why I had spent hours of each day studying and going to different practices and rehearsals and meetings. And then I reached that goal. Ivy Day felt like the best day of my life — but it also left me confused.
I didn’t — and still don’t — know what to do post-graduation. There is no longer a clear next step that I’m working towards. So while I was over the moon about this amazing opportunity Harvard presented to me, I was also scared. The possibilities were endless — a liberating but frightening thought. My newfound academic freedom was both a blessing and a curse because I had no idea what to do with it. And I became so afraid of my path being unclear that I veered off in an entirely new direction: conformity.
While many people say that college is the time to “find yourself,” funny enough, I had the opposite experience. Throughout my first year of college, I wanted to become what I believed to be the perfect Harvard student so badly that I completely lost myself in the process.
I tried so hard to convince myself that I wanted to be like the almost 15 percent of last year’s sophomores that declared Economics as their concentration. For what it’s worth, I loved my introductory microeconomics class. And I still believe that an economic way of thinking can be used to solve so many of society’s important issues — but I wanted to become an Economics concentrator for the wrong reasons. Studying economics was just another box to check off on my list of things I had to do to become the perfect Harvard student; it just took me a while to realize it.
I decided to change my intended concentration to Social Studies — an interdisciplinary concentration in the Social Sciences — during a four-hour-long car ride back to campus following a weekend-long retreat with the Opportunes: Harvard’s oldest all-gender a capella group. As we neared Cambridge, all I could feel was dread. The last thing I wanted to do was come back to a place where an impostor of myself resided. I felt like a fraud, and I was tired of convincing myself that I wanted to be someone who I never should have tried to become in the first place.
Ever since that fateful day a mere three weeks ago, I have felt as though a weight has been lifted off of me. Rejecting conformity was liberating. I now have the ability to carve out my own path and study things that I am truly passionate about. After months of being lost, I had found myself again.
Today, I know that I don’t want to be an impostor. Harvard does not make me who I am, nor does it make you who you are. There is no “right” way to be a Harvard student. We are all our own people outside of this institution, so let’s not allow it to shape us into people we don’t even recognize.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Watch your drink at this fraternity. Avoid going upstairs at this one. And stay clear of that third one altogether — you don’t want to be there alone.
College fraternities have a well-documented history of sexual and gender-based violence, a reputation threaded by an ever-growing collection of painful individual stories. All-male campus social spaces have long been accused of harboring and hiding predatory misconduct. Yet students across the United States seem increasingly unwilling to look the other way or pretend not to hear the loud, ugly whispers. Everywhere from Northwestern to Nebraska, UMass Amherst to Mississippi, student activists are demanding an end to Greek life and its associated ills, pushing their university administrators to persecute abuses more harshly or even seek the abolition of specific fraternities.
Their demands are well-justified. So is their anger. Activists’ concerns have so far proven accurate or at least credible enough to warrant action: At Northwestern, for example, reports of drugging led to a ban of social activities at fraternities until mid-October. The existence of active anti-fraternity movements even at schools with a strong Greek life campus culture highlights both the extent of the problem and the seemingly universal frustration with the system’s permissiveness of sexual assault.
Yet the root of the issue isn’t confined to the aforementioned schools, or even to all those with active fraternities. Rather, it stems from male-dominated social spaces, whether they are called fraternities, final clubs, or anything in between. Harvard’s final clubs aren’t excluded from the conversation by mere virtue of unorthodox terminology. Similarly, we must remain mindful that the involved students, perpetrators and victims alike, are our own peers, sitting next to us in class. Sexual assault at male social clubs isn’t an abstract notion but a reality; a plague pervading our, and virtually every other, campus.
Unfortunately, the path towards a healthier, safer campus social life remains remarkably uncertain. Universities can’t, after all, simply prune themselves of Greek life and the like: Harvard tried and failed. More crucially, attempts to crack down on misconduct in fraternities through suspensions risk backfiring, as existing members may limit access only to those they trust to never speak up, entrenching the secrecy that feeds abuse. If only closed lips make it past the door, the culture beyond it will only fester.
When the problem is discussed by fraternities, they pay lip service to acknowledging and disavowing the culture of sexual predation, except when the conversation is about events behind their doors. Vocalizing concern over an instance of abuse in a fraternity is perceived as passing a judgment on the character of all of the brothers, and thus such conversations are immediately shut down: “No, a [insert fraternity name] brother would never do something like that.” Until this commitment to change truly turns introspective, we remain skeptical that reform can come from the Interfraternity Conference’s promise of less hard alcohol or more sexual misconduct trainings.
And forcing change from the outside won’t be easy: Speaking up against fraternity culture can amount to ostracization. That leaves these whistleblowers, particularly those who have experienced sexual assault, stuck between accepting an unjustifiable paradigm or sacrificing their social lives on campus. And absent attractive social alternatives, student bodies will struggle to disentangle themselves from the campus Greek life that monopolizes the party scene, giving the fraternities the power to exclude whomever they wish: students who don’t embody the desired gender, look, weight, personality, or willingness to keep silent.
College students across the U.S. deserve better options. We deserve, more specifically, to be able to access a fun, even raucous, nightlife without subjecting ourselves to gendered objectification and predatory behavior. Our peers at fraternities need to do better; we need to do better. The schools that house us must acknowledge that, though eliminating fraternities has proven impracticable, we still need better options for our Saturday nights. Institutions of higher education nationwide, still outsmarted by these brotherhoods, should be putting their heads together to get us there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a controversial election last spring, the Harvard Extension Student Association — the official student government of the Extension School — is redrafting the board’s constitution and bylaws to establish transparency around its election process and prevent further contention.
Last semester, the group’s eligibility criteria were altered weeks before the election took place, preventing at least one candidate from running for the leadership.
Kevin F. Jura, the current HESA president who was elected amid last year’s dispute, said he sees this year as an opportunity to rebuild and “develop institutional memory” to ensure a smooth transition to the next administration.
“My plan for this year is to bring transparency back to HESA, and help lay the groundwork for future administrations, especially after all the issues the previous administration had last year,” Jura said. “I see this as a rebuilding year.”
By redrafting HESA’s bylaws and constitution, Jura said he hopes to avoid confusion and ensure that provisions do not contradict one another.
Andrea A. Stull, who serves as HESA’s secretary, said transparency and communication are paramount for this year’s administration.
“Transparency in terms of information is what HESA is primarily trying to accomplish so that we don't feel like the lost leading the lost,” Stull said.
Jura envisions a complete revamping of HESA’s communications system to augment the dissemination of information among Extension School students, including an updated formatting style for newsletters.
Jura added the board is actively working with the administration on efforts to change the Extension School’s degree name, but recognized that it will likely be some time before the initiative gains the necessary support from the University’s governing bodies.
Students at HES receive a degree in “Extension Studies” rather than in their chosen field, a policy that some students have called disrespectful and misrepresentative of their academic careers.
“The university’s nearly 400 years old, its bureaucracy is just as old,” Jura said. “Things do not happen overnight at Harvard, they happen in years or decades.”
Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Nancy Coleman wrote in an email to The Crimson last month that while she and other administrators are aware of students’ desire to change the degree name, they are “equally aware” of students and alumni who have said the current degree labeling has not hindered their professional success.
“The awarding of these diplomas is a testament to the academic rigor and commitment that goes into earning a degree at Harvard University, regardless of the name,” Coleman wrote. “However, we understand that the naming of degrees awarded through Harvard Extension School may appear unconventional to some.”
Coleman added the administration is “exploring” the topic of degree nomenclature through “appropriate governance venues at Harvard.”
Apart from the degree name change efforts, Stull said she hopes the work she and other HESA members do this year will benefit future boards and help them achieve their goals.
“We're trying to also create a foundation so that next year’s board can have guidance from us to continue on with their goals, and their vision, and their dreams for what they want to see,” Stull said. “It’s not just ‘this is our year, we’re going to do X, Y and Z.’ We're trying to build a legacy. We’re trying to create a legacy.”

Mia Mingus, an anti-violence and disability justice advocate, received the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award on Friday for her involvement in creating the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative and her work as a core member of the Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective.
Mingus’ work has focused on combatting child sexual abuse and other violence, particularly against disabled individuals.
Mass. State Representative Elizabeth “Liz” Miranda and Harvard Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro introduced Mingus and presented the award.
Mingus was adopted from South Korea and raised in the Caribbean, and said witnessing the work of a local organization to end domestic violence sparked her interest in service. She recalled having her neighbors hide in her home from their abusers before fleeing the island.
“I remember, even being at that young age, thinking, I want to be part of making the violence stop,” Mingus said.
The award is named for Robert Coles ’50, an author, psychiatrist, and former Harvard professor, as well as a PBHA board member. Coles has received both a Pulitzer Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of his work.
Mingus lauded the efforts of activists working to resist oppressive and violent systems, but said she prefers to take a systemic approach to combat violence by altering the conditions that allow for it.
“We all have a stake in how violence is responded to and we all collectively create the conditions that allow for violence to happen,” Mingus said. “Somehow in our society, people are learning how to abuse, torture, rape, et cetera, and so that means that it’s not just a couple of bad apples.”
Mingus rejected the idea that current systems of imprisonment and violence are too deeply rooted to redesign.
“Things do not have to be done the way that they have always been done, just stop,” she said. “Get that out of your head and get creative. Think outside the box.”
Mingus asked students to be mindful of the “charity model” that she argued is predicated on “pity” when working in spaces with people with disabilities. She advised students to create an inclusive environment conducive to meaningful relationships in groups such as Best Buddies, a PBHA program that fosters one-on-one relationships between students and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Cambridge.
Farah M. Afify ’22, the president of PBHA who gave introductory remarks at the event, said Mingus’s award has been “a long time coming.” According to Afify, the PBHA has incorporated transformative and disability justice practices and skills from Mingus’ blog, Leaving Evidence, into its workshops and trainings.
She said she hopes students involved in PBHA programs will internalize the lessons from Mingus’s lecture.
“Youth, kids, schools can really benefit from an approach like transformative justice,” Afify said. “How great would it be if kids didn’t feel like they were being punished or internalizing this idea of punishment as a path to address harm?”

Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences developed a theory for how apples get their cusp-like features by drawing upon singularity theory, according to an Oct. 4. paper published in Nature Physics.
Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan — a professor of applied mathematics, biology, and physics — co-authored the paper with postdoctoral fellow Aditi Chakrabarti, former postdoctoral fellow Thomas C. T. Michaels, SEAS researcher Sifan Lin, and Eric Sun ’22. The team utilized experiments, models, computations, and theory to investigate how apples get their signature dimple.
Though seemingly mundane apple morphology rarely concerns even the most curious of scholars, Mahadevan had been musing over this particular concept for nearly a decade before it bore fruit.
“I’ve been fascinated for a long time by trying to understand how shape arises in biology,” he said. “Shape enables function, and shape also constrains function.”
Mahadevan focused on a specific part of the apple — not the round flesh, but the dimple-like cusp where the skin converges to meet the stem.
Cusps are not unique to apples, as they appear in a wide variety of contexts from optics to fluid dynamics and are an example of a singularity, prompting the researchers to refer to singularity theory in their research.
The experiment evolved in three stages — observing, modeling, and computing.
Michaels collected and observed apples from an orchard at Peterhouse College at University of Cambridge in England, while Chakrabarti created gel models of apples to simulate the formation of a cusp. Finally, the team performed mathematical analysis and developed digital models.
The team also investigated the science behind apples with multiple cusps, like Red Delicious apples with their lumpy undersides. They found that multi-cusp characteristics resulted from certain variables related to the carpels — compartments within the apple that contain the seeds.
Digital simulations and gel models of fast growth around the carpels produced a number of cusps equal to the number of carpels, while slow growth resulted in a single cusp. Under certain conditions, the team also found the number of cusps that developed was dependent on the ratio of the plant’s stalk to the apple’s diameter — a trend that persisted across other fruits.
Beyond the specific findings as they relate to apples, however, morphogenesis — the science of how shapes originate — can be applied to a variety of fields, including clinical applications in humans, according to Chakrabarti.
“Understanding how growth and form happens can help treat malformations,” Chakrabarti said. “The more we study the variety of shape and form, it just adds knowledge of how shapes arise in nature.”
Though apples may seem like elementary objects of scientific inquiry, it was this very quality that Michaels said was critical to his love of the subject.
“In some sense, it was a little bit like becoming a child again,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to launch a Q-Guide for student organizations at the College and began the voting process to improve its financial accountability.
The first initiative starts conversations between the UC, the Dean of Students Office, and the Hub to create a Club “Q-Guide,” eponymously named after a similar program students formerly used to rate classes at the College.
“It can be difficult to understand the environment of various clubs without sometimes undergoing an extensive comp process or having connections with students already involved at the organization,” the act states.
The Club Q-Guide comes as the College’s Covid-19 restrictions continue to hamper students from fully “understanding the environment of clubs” and will work to help remove institutional bias, per the legislation.
The act also says student organizations are integral to the campus experience and that creating a communal shift at Harvard requires “incentivizing” new behaviors.
It continues by outlining that students from underrepresented backgrounds face challenges, such as “gaslighting” and “repercussions,” and need a place to share their grievances and concerns.
“Student leadership within these organizations deserve an opportunity to rectify their mistakes and show growth,” the act says.
The Student Residential Life Committee of the UC will commence its conversations with the DSO and The Hub on how to structure the Q-Guide. The legislation does not provide details on how the Q-Guide will exactly function.
The legislation was sponsored by Lowell House Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24, Maple Yard Representatives John S. Cooke ’25 and Jada Pierre ’25, and Ivy Yard Representative Sebastian Ramírez Fuene ’25.
The second piece of legislation passed establishes a constitutional amendment that restructures and improves the financial accountability of the Council.
“It is critical that the Undergraduate Council exercises prudent judgement when allocating and managing funds raised for the Council from student contributions considering that those contributions were made specifically to enable activities and initiatives for students,” the legislation reads.
As a result, the Council is adding an additional section to its constitution that specifies a policy for engaging in external partnerships.
Per the legislation, the UC is prohibited from entering into partnerships with non-Harvard-affiliated organizations in which financial obligations exceed $1,000 unless both parties sign a written contract.
The legislation was sponsored by Dunster House Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24.
The UC also passed an order Sunday to begin a procedure determining student dining preferences in Harvard Square and offer student discounts to these establishments.
The act will play a role in the Communications Committee’s “Crimson Takes Cambridge” program, which will focus on aiding local businesses in the Square and provide College students opportunities to “enjoy” the Square.
The legislation was sponsored by Mather House Representative Yousuf Bakshi ’23.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A documentary on a Black woman trying to reclaim her family’s history by suing Harvard University over its possession of photographs depicting her enslaved ancestors premiered Friday at a Harvard Square movie theater.
Tamara K. Lanier, a Connecticut resident, sued the University in March 2019 to gain the rights to historic photos of enslaved people she says are her ancestors. The Middlesex Superior Court dismissed Lanier’s case in March. She appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which is set to review the case on Nov. 1.
The film, entitled “Free Renty: Lanier v. Harvard,” follows Lanier throughout her legal battle with Harvard. It premiered at the Brattle Theatre two weeks before the hearing.
Daguerreotypes of two enslaved people, Renty and Delia, are at the center of the legal case. The photographs, which reside in Harvard’s Peabody Museum, are believed to be among the oldest images of enslaved people. They depict Lanier’s great-great-great-grandfather and his daughter, according to Lanier.
The photos were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz in the 19th century as part of a racist study to prove the superiority of white people. Lanier has requested the University return the photos to her and relinquish any profit made through the photos.
The film documents Lanier as she approaches attorney Benjamin L. Crump to represent her. Crump, a civil rights attorney, has taken on several high-profile cases, such as the wrongful death lawsuits of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Trayvon Martin.
“When I approached attorney Crump on this matter, it was at a well-attended and rather large conference where there were many, many, many people,” Lanier said in an interview with The Crimson. “I started talking about my experience with Harvard — that I felt it was an important reparations matter that would require a special attorney to take on this challenge.”
It was then that Peabody and Emmy award-winning filmmaker David Grubin heard about Lanier’s case and began documenting it.
Grubin said in an interview he hopes viewers walk away with a better understanding of Lanier’s journey.
“You want people to feel that they are walking in Tammy’s shoes — that you see and feel for her struggle,” Grubin said. “This is a woman who’s persevered over years and years and hasn’t given up.”
Grubin said on a larger scale, Lanier’s legal claims raise fundamental questions about museums and their ownership over artifacts.
Grubin referenced a Crimson interview with University President Lawrence S. Bacow in 2019, in which Bacow said the law was on Harvard’s side when it came to Lanier’s case.
“I wonder whether people will feel that that’s enough,” Grubin said. “Lots of Harvard students are looking for some kind of moral guidance and ethical responsibility from the University.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the new documentary or Harvard’s decision to not engage with the filmmakers, citing pending litigation.
The film features other prominent figures, such as author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who in 2017 encouraged the University to consider monetary reparations for slavery at a conference hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. At the conference, one of the daguerreotypes depicting Renty featured on the screen behind him.
Lanier said the Brattle Theatre was the perfect place for the film to premiere, as it is in Harvard’s “backyard.” She also noted Harvard’s refusal to comment or engage with the documentary.
“Who’s absent from the table? Harvard — by their own doing. So I thought it was just poetic justice in my mind, it was a perfect opportunity to raise awareness of Harvard’s resistance throughout this entire process,” Lanier said.

Economists and race relations experts convened to discuss the economic repercussions of structural racism in America and the need for continued workplace diversity Friday at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center.
Part of the virtual two-day “Truth and Transformation Conference,” the panel was moderated by MarketWatch reporter Levi Sumagaysay and featured a number of panelists, including economists Dana M. Peterson and Lisa D. Cook, President and CEO of PolicyLink Michael McAfee, Director of Harvard’s Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project Khalil G. Muhammad, and Equity at Work Council executive director Jarik Conrad.
Muhammad, an HKS professor who organized the conference, reflected on the structural inequities faced by minorities today and the work needed to dismantle those structures.
“The racism is baked into the algorithm, the credit report, the police department, the neighborhood school, the patient profile, the curriculum, all you have to do is follow the rules,” Muhammad said.
“Our theory of change began ultimately with historical reckoning, that coming to terms with where you are as an individual and your organization sits in relation to the history of racialized power, is the first step towards transformation,” he added.
Peterson, the chief economist of the nonprofit The Conference Board, talked specifically about the issue of credit access denial for Black entrepreneurs and explained how solving this problem could help solve America’s unemployment crisis.
“When you also think about the six million jobs that aren’t created because these Black entrepreneurs were denied access to financing along every point in the spectrum, that six million a year, that’s incredible,” Peterson said.
“If we gave Black entrepreneurs the ability to finance their businesses, because all businesses need lines of credit and financing, we could solve the unemployment problem right away,” she added.
Addressing the topic of diversity, equality, and inclusion in the workplace, McAfee explained that he and other proponents have faced pushback in convincing corporations to adopt such policies.
“People have the audacity to ask us about results — the results are held hostage right now because we can’t get to the liberatory work that would lift that 100 million plus who are economically insecure in America, into the middle class and beyond,” McAfee said.
Cook, a professor of economics at Michigan State University, used the results of her research to explain how diversity policies are both economically feasible and an essential measure to boost the economy.
“What I have found, and what my co-author and I have calculated, is that GDP per capita would be 0.6 percent to 4.4 percent higher if more African Americans and more women were engaged in the innovation process from beginning to end,” Cook said. “So I think the reality is actually the opposite — we can’t afford to not do it.”
McAfee pointed to the need for major, long-term structural change rather than temporary fixes in order to redress past and ongoing inequalities.
“People of color are not asking for charity, we’re asking for a redesign of the nation. And so with all due respect, the money is nice, but it’s one-offs,” McAfee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly a thousand colorful backpacks dotted Harvard Yard on Saturday, symbolizing the average number of college students who die by suicide each year.
The backpack exhibit, entitled “Send Silence Packing,” put an under-addressed issue on glaring display for everyone wandering through the Yard: mental health is a struggle on college campuses, including Harvard’s.
“The main purpose is to spread awareness toward suicide prevention, just educate students regarding what resources are available,” said Elizabeth T. Wang ’23, who last fall helped co-found a Harvard chapter of Active Minds, a national organization committed to improving mental health in young adults.
For a decade, Active Minds has put on similar displays at college campuses across the country, tallying over 200 demonstrations, per the national organization.
Saturday’s exhibit in Harvard Yard marked the first event organized since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and the first stop in a roughly 32-school traveling tour, according to Aaron C. Plattus, a tour coordinator for the national organization.
People walking through the Yard Saturday could pick up pamphlets or scan QR-codes to learn more about the exhibit and suicide prevention resources.
Wang said the visual and supplementary resources can make a real difference in improving students’ mental health.
“There’s information on how to help out a friend in distress, how to notice and see the signs of suicide in a friend or how to get help for oneself,” she said.
Many of the backpacks on display once belonged to college students who died by suicide and were donated to Active Minds by family or loved ones. Almost 300 backpacks included attached photographs and stories remembering lives lost, submitted to Active Minds throughout the year. Every year, the organization continues to collect new backpacks and stories.
Harvard student peer counseling groups Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach and Contact Peer Counseling were also in the Yard Saturday, speaking with passersby about the resources they offer.
Per Wang, Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services clinicians were available in the Yard in case attendees found the exhibit “distressing.” Harvard University Health Services and the Undergraduate Council helped fund the event, she added.
Hannah R. Alton ’22, the chapter’s other founder, said they placed warning signs around the edges of the exhibit to notify passersby of its “heavy” content.
“Since a lot of first-years live sort of around here and might just come across this not knowing what’s going on, we want to inform people that this is potentially triggering content,” she said.” “It can be pretty emotional for people.”
Javhlan Amgalanbaatar ’23-’24 and Devon N. Gates ’23-’24 came to see the Send Silence Packing event together after seeing details on social media. As they approached the hundreds of backpacks, Gates said it was difficult to “comprehend everything that was lost.”
“Reading it from the perspective of the people who loved them, was so much more heartbreaking,” Amgalanbaatar said.
“Especially during midterm season, this is great timing for this event in a very high stress environment at a very high stress time,” Gates said. “I think this is great to remind people of the sanctity of life.”
For James T. “Jim” Maher, who graduated from the Extension School and was visiting Harvard Saturday, reading the stories was especially difficult.
Maher, who said his brother died by suicide, was struck by how unexpected each suicide had been for many of the friends and family members.
It is “so easy to overlook the signs” of suicide, he added.
Jacob C. Hawkins, who graduated from the Kennedy School, came across the backpacks while giving a tour of the campus to a friend.
Upon seeing the backpacks, Hawkins said he felt compelled to return and pray for those considering suicide. He said he had previously contemplated suicide but turned to Jesus to allay his hardship.
“For me, it’s a wake-up call that people in this world are hurting. They’re struggling,” Hawkins said.
Andrew J. Thomas, a freshman at the University of Wyoming visiting Harvard’s campus, contrasted the exhibit to a lack of awareness about mental health in his home state of Wyoming, which has the highest suicide rate of any U.S. state.
Thomas noted that he knows several young people, including a close friend, who died by suicide.
“No one talks about it. It happens and then people just ignore it and they move on,” he said. “I think having something like this is really special for someone that’s struggling. They can come out and even for people that don't understand it too, it brings a wider understanding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brown silenced Harvard’s potent attack on a windy Saturday afternoon at Jordan Field, dashing the Crimson’s hopes for an undefeated season and dealing it what could be a fatal blow in the race for the Ivy League title. The 1-0 defeat was deja vu for No.8/16 Harvard (9-1-1, 3-1-0), whose last loss came on the same weekend of the Ancient Eight season two years ago at home against reigning Ivy League champions No.22/NR Brown (9-3-0, 4-0-0).
The Bears broke the deadlock in the 75th minute of what was a tight and tense game throughout. Brown’s two star strikers came through again when the team needed them most. A clearance by Harvard first-year center back Jade Rose found the feet of dangerous junior forward Ava Seelenfreund, who on her first touch played a perfectly weighted pass ahead to junior forward Brittany Raphino. Senior left back Maria DiMartinis overran the ball, allowing Raphino to collect it and to fire a first-time shot past sophomore goalie Anna Karpenko and into the top left corner for her seventh goal of the season. One slip-up and miscommunication between the Crimson’s defense, which has been solid all season, was enough to propel the Bears past Harvard.
The Crimson desperately tried to advance the ball in the last 15 minutes, but the Bears always had the answers, forcing Harvard down the line and daring fullbacks to send in hopeful crosses from wide, unthreatening positions. All too often, the Crimson complied on a day in which it lacked ideas against a stout and assured Brown defense. Most of its crosses fluttered into the safe hands of senior goalie Kayla Thompson, who was in command throughout the afternoon.
“It hurts to lose a game, but I think we played well,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “I don’t think we let ourselves down. I thought we moved the ball well. Brown defended very very well, made it difficult for us to break them down. I’m proud of the effort, proud of the way we approached the game, we just lacked a little bit in the final third.”
Harvard did manage to create a few chances, paramount among them an incisive cross early in the second half by junior right back Jordan Di Verniero that found Rose, who headed the ball just wide. But for the most part, the Crimson could not turn its significant possession advantage into gilt-edge chances. An attack that had scored nine goals in its first three league games and ranked in the top-12 in the nation in overall shots and shots on goal per game coming in could not generate much against Harvard’s toughest opponent of the season. The 11 shots and two shots on goal the Crimson mustered were both season lows.
For the first time since their injuries a month ago against Kansas, Harvard noticeably missed starting forwards Ainsley Ahmadian (first-year) and 2019 Ivy League player of the year Murphy Agnew (senior). Both are dynamic players who provide different elements to the attack, with Agnew’s speed and ability on the counter-attack and Ahmadian’s tendency to find pockets of space and create chances virtually unmatched by the rest of the Crimson squad.
“All teams have to deal with injuries at different times,” Hamblin said. “[Agnew and Ahmadian] are obviously very impactful players. It would have given us some different looks and maybe given us some different pieces of the puzzle, and that was something that we dealt with. I’m proud of the way the team performed, and I think people stepped up into those roles and did a good job.”
The Bears, for their part, did not add much attacking intent to what was largely a dour game. They took just six shots and had very little possession in the final third, instead choosing to sit back and test Harvard on the counter-attack. For the most part, the Crimson’s defense was sound, and Brown had nowhere near the attacking success it did two years ago, when it put four goals past the home side. But one chance was enough for Brown’s experienced and explosive front two to win the game. And because the Bears have already beaten the third championship contender, Princeton, they now have a huge leg up in the race for the Ivy League championship.
“I don’t think they had [many chances],” Hamblin said. “We didn’t give them much, but they took advantage of [their one chance]. And it’s heartbreaking for the group, they have been working so hard and played so well. But this game we love is brutal. It’s brutal. And we’ve got to grow from it. We’ve got to bounce back now, the only thing we can do is bounce back.”
Harvard returns to action on Tuesday against Central Connecticut State before a pivotal meeting next Saturday with No.24/RV Princeton (10-2-1, 3-1-0). The Crimson will have to refocus quickly as it seeks to stay in touch with the Bears atop the Ivy League standings and, failing a Brown slip-up against a lower-rated Ancient Eight opponent, to keep itself in the mix for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the fifth time in eleven games this season, Harvard played overtime on Saturday night after regulation was not enough to find a winner. After a hard-fought 110 minutes, the Crimson men had to settle for a 2-2 draw with Brown.
Harvard (4-4-3, 0-1-2 Ivy League) is still looking for its first Ivy League victory of the season following Saturday night’s matchup. Despite having the majority of the chances and more than twice as many shots as Brown (3-7-1, 1-1-1 Ivy), the Crimson was not able to find a winner in front of its home crowd.
“I thought we controlled the game right from the start, we dictated play, and had possession,” sophomore midfielder Willem Ebbinge said of the match. “We created chance after chance, but we just need to really be clinical if we're gonna push past these teams going forward.”
Harvard found itself behind early after conceding in just the third minute of the contest, after failing to clear a cross into the box. Brown’s striker climbed highest following the scramble, sending a looping header into the side of the net to put Brown ahead with just over two minutes played.
The goal seemed to wake the Crimson men up, who began to take control of the game after a shaky start. Harvard’s first real chance of the game came in the 20th minute through Ebbinge, who danced through four defenders before sending the ball across goal, which was cleared off the line through a last-ditch challenge that retained Brown’s lead.
The Crimson was awarded a free kick just over a minute later when first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti was pulled down as he ran through on goal. Ebbinge took the kick from about 25 yards out and struck the inside of the post, which sent the ball back across goal. Arlotti showed his striker’s instinct, popping up in the right place at the right time to tap the ball into the empty net for his team-best sixth goal of the season, which leveled the game at 1-1.
Harvard grabbed a second goal under three minutes later, in the 24th minute, after an impressive passage of play. Following a series of passes on the right side, sophomore midfielder James Fahmy dished the ball to Ebbinge just outside the box, who hit a beautifully weighted one-touch pass over the top into the box. Junior forward Martin Vician timed his run to perfection, heading the ball past the onrushing keeper who was caught in no man’s land, putting the Crimson ahead 2-1. Ebbinge tallied assists on both goals, his fifth and sixth of the season, which leads the team.
Following the break, Harvard was again caught flat-footed, nearly conceding in the opening seconds of the half. Brown went long on the kickoff and the Crimson failed to fully clear, with the ball falling to the feet of a Brown striker just in front of the goal. Junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson came up with a huge save to preserve Harvard’s lead before defender and captain Fernando Docters cleared the ball off the line on the ensuing corner kick. Brown registered nine corners on the night, while Harvard was awarded eight.
The Crimson again settled into the game following the slow start, creating a good number of chances, but failing to find the back of the net. Brown managed to level the game against the run of play in the 69th minute, after its striker collided with Nilsson on a cross, and bungled the ball into the back of the net. The Harvard players surrounded the referee, arguing that Nilsson was fouled, but the official was not swayed and the goal counted, which leveled the score at 2-2.
“I think the response was good, we scored two goals, and then had the very unfortunate second goal,” junior forward Martin Vician said of the game. “I think overall, we combined well and played pretty well. It was an unlucky game.”
The Crimson continued to create chances as the game progressed, but neither team was able to find a winner after 90 minutes of regulation and 20 minutes of extra time. Harvard tallied 28 shots on the night, its season-high, compared to 13 for Brown.
The Crimson heads out to Worcester on Tuesday to face Holy Cross at 7 p.m. for its final non-conference matchup of the season.

When I, a naive, young Harvard premed, already in my junior year, arrived in LS2 on Wednesday, October 13, 2021, at 11:57:23 a.m., my friend sat expectantly with her laptop screen open to the dreaded purple banner and subpar page design of the Association of American Medical Colleges website. MCAT registration was opening today, TODAY, in two minutes and 37 seconds. To me, this was semi-interesting news as I supposed that I could sign up for the January test date whenever I saw fit. I wisely decided not to worry and attempted to enjoy the riveting lecture.
But as my friend’s screen began counting down the seconds to registration opening, I began to wonder if I was missing something. When my MCAT friend turned to me and exclaimed that all her preferred test centers were full ZERO seconds after sign-ups started, I knew I was missing something. And when her check-out total of $325 flashed across the screen, I KNEW I was missing A LOT of things.
As a typical Harvard premed with little individuality, too much confidence, raging imposter syndrome, and a predictable obsession with boringly good grades, I’ve been constantly debating for years whether I want to sell out, cry, drop out, or start studying for the MCAT. Unfortunately for me, on August 1, 2021, Anki ensnared my soul. One would think that software with such a cute little name and its own reputation on medical school TikTok would provide all the sunshine and rainbows necessary to carry you to easy MCAT success. WRONG.
I repeat, Anki owns my soul. Every day, two hours a day, it’s flashcard after flashcard. Wow! Did you learn 30 new cards today? That’s great! Now here’s 200 from previous days you can review. Miss a day? No problem! Here are 400 reviews and 60 new cards xoxo. How long could this really last, you might ask? My deck (I’ve been using MilesDowns for anyone looking for a special kind of torture;)) contains 2,888 cards. I’ve been going for 74 days. No food, no sleep, just Anki. A moment of silence for myself and all those who have suffered under the thumb of this astounding software mind controller.
Every day, for the past 37 days, I have considered the beautiful dreamland that could be awaiting me in the world of biotech consulting. After the PS2 midterm, when I sat in my bed reviewing my 123rd flashcard, I thought my career in medicine might already be over. The very next day, after the LS2 midterm, with my sanity teetering and awakeness fading, I pulled out my laptop and opened the dreaded Anki once again because IT NEVER STOPS *sniff sniff*.
All this leads me to think about what happened to my social life. Not that I have time for any non-premed thoughts, don’t get me wrong. Did I ever have time for hanging with friends and going out? I’m too busy studying for the MCAT to study for the MCAT, let alone to have a spicy night (or day). On top of that, today I pledged 325 beautiful dollars to the test-taking demon corporation that does an even better job of crushing hopes and dreams than orgo<3.
Lower the barriers to entering medicine, they said. We need doctors, they said. Hahahaha, hang in there my premed friends. Would love to rant more, but I need to go study for, you guessed it, the MCAT. January 21 test date is only 95 days away baby.
