After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re living in a state of war. It’s beyond stressful for everyone.
The link between heightened chronic stress and a weakened immune response is well-established in psychological literature. Citing one professor of infectious disease, a recent Wall Street Journal article warned readers, “The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it.” Seriously. The chronic inflammation and high cortisol levels stress causes can erode the body’s ability to rapidly marshal the immune system and even activate latent viruses.
Students are no exception — certainly not to stress nor to its negative effects.
Unfortunately, COVID-19 has imposed chronic stress on all of us — stress from leaving campus early, being quarantined in a room, seeing constant reminders of a seemingly omnipresent threat splayed on every TV screen and newspaper, or living with the threat that the virus is posing to us and our loved ones. This is to say nothing of students for whom the ramifications of COVID-19 have caused disproportionate stress. For some, life at home is unstable; for others, mental illness has been exacerbated, and for yet others, low-income or first-generation status poses additional challenges that the rest of us can only imagine.
This increased stress has potentially deadly implications.
While it affects other demographics more harshly, young people can, have, and will fall ill and die from COVID-19. Our peers with underlying medical conditions are at even greater risk. Therefore, the extra chronic stress this pandemic has brought into all of our daily lives puts us at an increased risk of severe illness and death.
Despite its decision to implement a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system, the College can still change course to help its students be prepared to fight the virus properly. It can implement a universal pass for the semester. Why? Because by eliminating the possibility of failure, stressful decisions, and opportunities for students to prioritize their academic work as opposed to their health, it’s the model that reduces chronic stress the most.
Some claim that an opt-in pass-fail model offers more flexibility. But giving students the option to opt into pass-fail grading would only cause more stress. Students would be torn between their physical and mental health — which might require a switch to pass-fail — and a fear of stigmatization for that decision (either by their peers or by programs that examine transcripts).
This fear may or may not be rational, but that’s irrelevant. The only relevant point is that many students would experience an increase in stress caused by the perceived choice between their transcript and their health. Furthermore, once the students make the decision, this stress could remain in the form of the student wondering whether they made the correct choice. Perhaps most importantly, however, given the extremely competitive nature of Harvard’s academic culture, I fear many students would choose against their health, which must be avoided — especially in the middle of a pandemic.
Others have advocated for the “Double A” model, in which students would all receive either an A or an A-minus. But this still would leave a large element of stress. Given the well-documented grade inflation at Harvard, where the median grade is an A-minus and according to recent data the average GPA is a 3.65 (or about an A-minus, compared to a national average of 3.15), many students would continue to push themselves towards the A, especially when it is uncertain how professors would distribute the A and A-minus grades. What’s more, the “Double A” model would worsen stress. Many students would surely worry that an A-minus would essentially be viewed as “not an A” on one’s transcript, exacting even more pressure on them to perform academically.
One concern raised by students is that many were expecting to increase their GPAs this semester and that the new universal system no longer allows them to do so. The stress and anxiety the lack of an expected GPA boost can cause due to fears of its effects on job prospects, grad school, and programs that examine transcripts is real. The optimal system would also pass everyone with a 4.0. I’m serious; health must come before all else.
As for universal emergency SAT-UNSAT, it’s certainly much better than the opt-in or Double A models. Still, Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay stated it best on Friday: “Everything has changed … we are facing something that imperils the health of every human on the planet.”
Normally, the University’s primary obligation is its educational mission. Now, it’s to save as many lives as possible — something administrators understand, given the University’s de-densifying, quarantining, and social distancing efforts. Universal pass does not have the possibility of effective failure, making it an inherently less stressful system than a universal emergency SAT-UNSAT. Sure, some students may not do schoolwork under this system, but that’s an infinitesimally small price to pay if the accompanying stress reduction has the potential to aid the health of our community during a dangerous pandemic.
In light of these considerations, I ask the administration: What could possibly justify deeming a student’s performance unsatisfactory? What does that add in this moment of crisis? Who does it help?
Of course, I only discussed the effects each of these models will have on student stress. But how these systems affect the stress levels of TFs and professors must be taken into account as well.
Even if you believe that the connection between stress and immune response is tenuous (which it isn’t), if a member of our community passes away as a result of COVID-19, we will have wished we had done everything in our power to keep them healthy. We have everything to lose.
Emergency SAT-UNSAT is one of the better options available, but for the sake of our health, Harvard should pass everyone this semester, preferably with a 4.0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Goodbyes. Hugs. Last meals with friends. Last Annenberg food. Packing. Making the most of the last days.
No amount of words or descriptions like these could capture the last three weeks. We are all still trying to process the events, yet everything continues to feel surreal.
Sitting in my room alone after saying goodbye to all the friends I was able to see after the sudden announcement that campus would be closing, I was overwhelmed with different emotions. I felt longing. Longing for the days that were lost, for the memories and plans that were cut short. I felt lonely. With Mongolia’s borders closing just a day before the announcement, I could not go home and had to seek housing on campus. I was fortunate to be approved to stay on campus, and I am grateful to have access to stable food and resources for the remainder of the semester.
After a difficult transition and a period of homesickness during my first semester, I was beginning to feel more at ease and comfortable at Harvard — thanks to a trip home during winter break and how much closer I’ve grown to my friends here who made every day shine a little brighter. With spring gradually arriving and the weather blessing us with some sunshine, on the days leading up to the notification, students and visitors enjoyed the warmth and each other’s company on the grassy Harvard Yard. I was one of them, but the serenity was shattered by the chaos that ensued in the following week like a scene of an apocalyptic movie.
During the ample time spent alone since my friends’ departure, I have been reflecting on how the meaning of home has shifted for me throughout the past months. From originally only associating the concept of home with the place I grew up in, I have found home far away from Mongolia in a small Yard and, more importantly, in people who made me feel comfortable and made the place warm and inspiring. This sentiment has been echoed by many of my peers upon leaving, and with students now spread across the United States and the world, we are all connected through a yearning for our shared home in Cambridge.
Now, with the campus mostly deserted and the streets emptier, I am once again reaching for comfort and acceptance of my current situation. Isolation and loneliness are more prominent, and I have been trying my best to engage with my friends on campus (with appropriate distance, of course) and loved ones far away. Being away from family at this time is a challenge, and with thousands of international and domestic students in the U.S. staying on their respective campuses, it is a time to remember to take all of this day by day and allow ourselves to just be.
These days, just going through one day with presence and awareness is enough to keep me going. Although sometimes I have no idea what I am doing, I am cultivating as much calmness in my days as possible. Being outside even for a few minutes helps me be more grounded, and with the weather improving in Cambridge, the Charles River is still as beautiful and more lasting than any of my circumstances. The Yard is empty and when I go near Canaday or Annenberg, I feel a rush of nostalgic memories. I am happy to remember the good times we were so fortunate to share at Harvard.
The seriousness of the situation right now is daunting, and I hope we all go through this period safe and healthy. I hope we stay connected and do our best to make sure this crisis passes soon. Despite all the sad goodbyes, I rest knowing that after the pandemic subsides, we will once again be zero miles apart to learn and to connect, to share and to inspire, without any health repercussions.
After all of this passes, we will have days full of hellos. Hugs. Moments. Reunion meals with friends. First upperclassman house food. Unpacking. When that time comes, I hope we will make the most of every day together. Until then, please stay healthy and safe!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will postpone its annual Board of Overseers and Harvard Alumni Association directorship elections to July.
In an email to alumni, William F. Lee ’72, who serves as the Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation, and Michael H. Brown ’83, who serves as the President of the Board of Overseers, wrote that the global pandemic created uncertainty surrounding the 2020 Harvard elections.
“Rather than launch the elections right now in the face of such uncertainty, the governing boards decided at their meetings over the past two days to shift the start of the elections from April 1 until early to mid-July,” they wrote. “By then, we hope the disruption being experienced by people in communities worldwide will have at least begun to abate.”
The Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — is responsible for advising Harvard’s top administrators, providing input on the University’s direction, and approving certain actions taken by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
HAA’s board of directors serves as an advisory board to develop alumni volunteer leadership and engagement. An HAA Committee is also responsible for the nomination of candidates for the University’s annual Board of Overseers election.
All Harvard degree holders are eligible to vote in the elections via traditional paper ballot or online, except for two groups: those in University instruction and governance positions and members of the Harvard Corporation.
Lee and Brown noted in the email that 43 percent of voters chose the mail-in paper ballot method last year despite the online voting option.
“At a moment when mail systems may not function in predictable ways, and when many voters who receive Harvard correspondence at their business addresses have been forced by circumstance to remain at home, deferring the start date seems the best path to assuring a sound election,” they wrote.
Lee and Brown wrote that they have been in touch with the individual candidates regarding the announcement to delay the election.
“This should allow the candidates who are elected to take up their roles in time for the first regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Overseers and the HAA directors this fall,” they wrote. “We have been in touch with the candidates for both elections to make them aware of the schedule change and to thank them for their understanding.”
They added that they hope alumni will vote in the delayed election.
“More information about the elections will be coming your way this summer as the start date approaches,” Lee and Brown wrote. “We do hope you will vote when the time comes. Even more, we hope you and your loved ones stay safe and well.”

As Harvard postdoctoral fellow Michael F. Wells walked home from his last in-person laboratory meeting for the foreseeable future, one thing was on his mind — finding a way to combat the spread of COVID-19 that had forced his research group to close for two months.
“I really wanted an outlet for me, like someone like me, to be able to help out in this fight,” Wells said. “I knew I was, by far, not the only one who felt this way. And so what happened was, on the walk home from work that day from lab, I thought, ‘Hey, I should try to organize something here in Boston so I could potentially be a part of a group that makes themselves available to health department officials or county officials.’”
Now, Wells is developing a database of volunteer researchers across the country to help perform COVID-19 lab work, using a Google Form to collect information on each respondent’s location, expertise, and access to necessary lab materials.
Wells’ database, which currently boasts more than 7,000 entries, has been sent to various organizations researching and testing COVID-19, such as the Broad Institute and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The data is shared only with “key contacts throughout the country” who lead efforts against COVID-19, according to the database’s FAQ page. Harvard’s Division of Science posted a link to his Google Form on its website in a March 20 update on the pandemic.
Other researchers have joined Wells to form a group of managers, which they call the COVID-19 National Scientist Volunteer Database Coordination Team, for the database. Wells said one of the management team’s greatest successes was catching the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“After about a week of trying to find the right person, trying to get the emails to the right contacts, whatever may be, we finally got to the point where one of the leads at FEMA requested access to the database,” Wells said. “They were one of our primary targets after it became known that FEMA was going to take the lead on many of these different issues related to the virus, and so that was a big win for us.”
Through the connection with FEMA, database will serve as a bridge between talented scientists across the country and leaders in research efforts against COVID-19, according to Wells.
“Just knowing that this database is in the hands of these health officials is very empowering, because we did our part,” Wells said. “We can’t tell them, ‘Hey you have to hire us, you have to put us in these labs.’ We don’t have that power. But we do have the power of organization.”
Wells said the ultimate goal of his work “would be a situation where we don’t have to do this anymore” and the spread of COVID-19 would be successfully halted. If this were to happen, Wells said his database could still play a significant role in future responses to potential pandemics.
“When all is said and done, potentially the database could be used in some way to help maintain this type of reserve workforce, in case we have a second wave,” Wells said. “In case another pandemic happens five years from now, we’re already in a situation where we have scientists who can be called upon to help out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With students no longer on campus, Health Peer Advisors and Liaisons — a peer education group focused on student wellness — have turned to virtual platforms to continue to provide resources for students during the coronavirus pandemic.
HealthPALs serve as liaisons between students and Harvard University Health Services. The group typically organizes events including flu clinics and study breaks to build relationships with students and introduce them to the HUHS services available to them.
Patricia M. Fuentes ’21, president of HealthPALs, said the group has been in contact with HUHS staff since they began sending out emails about the coronavirus. Fuentes said that, at first, they would synthesize the information from HUHS emails and send it to students to make it more “digestible.”
Since leaving campus, HealthPALs have had to cancel some programming. But Fuentes said they are still trying to find ways to keep their organization strong and promote student wellness, albeit virtually.
“We're really trying to focus on that and trying to make sure that our membership and community is still very, very strong and that we're still visible within our houses as much as possible,” Fuentes said.
One project the group is working on involves making instructional videos about HUHS for students.
“We'd still like to continue doing HUHS instructional videos, which is something that we started doing beforehand, this past semester, to help people navigate HUHS and the different services that are available to them,” Fuentes said. “Now I guess we'll modify that in a way to fit the situation now.”
Fuentes also said they are also looking into creating fitness videos and making Instagram Live videos with a nutritionist.
“We'd have, for example, an Instagram Live where one of our board members would be with [HUHS nutritionist Margaret “Meg” Schrier] and we would go through our refrigerator and see if we can make a healthy meal out of what we have in our refrigerator,” Fuentes said.
Amanda J. Ayers, a HUHS educator who serves as the HealthPALs advisor, added that the Center for Wellness and Health Promotion is developing a website with virtual yoga, exercise, and meditation resources.
The Center for Wellness and Health Promotion usually hosts meditations on weekdays at lunchtime. Starting this week, these daily meditations will be streamed via Zoom.
Ayers said that, though the situation is difficult, she has been able to find a “silver lining” in developing virtual resources for students.
“Being more active with people online so that more people can access us has always been something we've been wanting to do,” Ayers said. “It's kind of been fun to be able to work on some of that and come up with a social media strategy and try to get more people involved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s transition to remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic has garnered mixed reactions from professors — while some report no significant difficulties in teaching online, others say they struggle to facilitate class participation.
The Law School began online classes on March 23, following University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s March 10 call for students to vacate campus and continue learning remotely.
Professor Jeannie Suk Gersen, who teaches the course “Constitutional Law: Separation of Powers, Federalism, and Fourteenth Amendment,” wrote in an email that her class was able to transition smoothly to the video conference platform Zoom because of its discussion-based format.
“The Socratic method that I use involves cold-calling students and engaging in questioning and dialogue,” she wrote. “It translates well to an online format: I call on a specific student, they unmute themselves, and we do the same thing that we would be doing in person.”
Like Suk Gersen, visiting professor Daniel S. Medwed said his section of criminal law — which relies on questioning an assigned panel of students during each lecture — has continued normally online.
But he noted difficulties in keeping the class engaged without being able to see students’ faces. When teaching the students in-person, Medwed said he often told stories or jokes if he felt the mood of the classroom dimmed. Since students can keep their cameras turned off during online lectures, he said Zoom limits his ability to read the class’s atmosphere.
“As teachers, we tend to rely on sort of nonverbal cues about how things are going — you know, smiles or if students seem bored,” Medwed said in an interview Monday. “Without having them in class, I find it much harder to know what the mood of the room is, and whether I need to change things.”
Medwed also raised concerns about the virtual “raise hand” function on Zoom, saying it makes class discussions confusing to navigate when he relies on voluntary participation rather than cold-calling on students.
“It's just slightly more difficult to keep track visually for me of the different hands,” he said. “Sometimes I feel like I'll call on one person, and then I'll lose somebody and then have to circle back.”
Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who teaches “Governing Digital Technology,” highlighted a similar problem, writing in an email that he now keeps running notes in order to follow class discussions.
“I'm not sure why, but keeping and holding a thread of discussion can be more difficult at a distance than in person, even when we wouldn't normally be using the chalkboard in person,” he wrote in an email.
The switch to remote learning has also forced professors to adjust the activities and exams they initially planned for their classes. Suk Gersen explained her class typically participates in a Supreme Court oral argument exercise, during which students argue against a real case, but that she had to modify the simulation for an online environment.
Similarly, Medwed said he had to cancel a field trip planned for this week. Rather than watching a case argued live in a courthouse, his students will now watch a recording of a case heard last month.
Zittrain added an optional assignment that ties the focus of his class on internet governance to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
“As a complement to the original final paper, students may opt to join a class-wide final exercise canvassing the sources, prevalance, impact, and remedies around online disinformation about the Coronavirus,” he wrote. “The aim is to achieve something publishable and useful -- and to be able to apply what we're learning in class, and through this new format, to something immediate and unsolved, while maintaining the big picture.”
Despite challenges brought about by remote instruction, the law professors said they admire students for their effort and participation in difficult circumstances. Medwed called it “pretty cool” that a significant number of students linger on Zoom and chat with him after lectures; Zittrain said his students seem excited to learn despite significant changes to their circumstances.
“Videoconferencing surely has its hurdles, but the students are really bringing it -- they're eager to be engaging with the substance of the class, and I hope for many that for long stretches it feels like we're in the zone rather than conscious of microphones, speaker, or Internet connection tweaks,” Zittrain wrote.
“I couldn't be more impressed by the students' gameness and resilience in the face of a decidedly suboptimal set of circumstances,” John Bowers ’18, who assists in Zittrain’s course, added. “The speed with which they've adapted to – and, indeed, learned to thrive under – the constraints of remote instruction is a wonderful reminder of why I'm so proud to be part of this community.”

Former United States Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy ’98 and former director of Doctors for America Alice Chen spoke to students about hope amid the coronavirus pandemic in a Tuesday webinar.
Murthy and Chen, who are married, were invited by South Asian Americans in Public Service, a Harvard College student organization. Both have previously spoken at SAAPS and Harvard Kennedy School events.
Aman A. Panjwani ’20, SAAPS co-founder and event co-organizer, said in an interview that he felt that there was a “lack of rhetoric” on hope and positivity during the outbreak, and that SAAPS sought to create an event to close that gap. As of March 29, there were 200 registered to attend the webinar, according to Panjwani.
In the webinar, Murthy and Chen took questions from student moderators and then opened the virtual floor to the audience.
Murthy predicts that even when the virus is under control, going back to normal “won’t be like flipping a switch.”
“It will be like a gradual phase-in,” he said. One such circumstance, he postulated, could be reopening of schools and workplaces but still banning large gatherings and concerts.
Both stressed the importance of self-care and mindfulness from home during the uncertainty of the developing pandemic.
“It’s so easy to be buried in an avalanche of everything that’s coming at you,” Murthy said. “Be easy on yourself.”
“No shame in Netflix!” Chen said, discussing ways to pass time at home.
Murthy urged others to conduct check-ins for oneself, family members, and neighbors for emotional support and bridge the loneliness that comes with social distancing. Especially for seniors with limited use of technology, check-ins from others can be especially impactful, even if it’s just “10 to 15 minutes a day.”
“One of the greatest gifts we can give somebody is the gift of our full attention,” Murthy said.
Chen added that these actions “seem small, but multiply them by thousands and millions, and we are stitching together a social network no policy can.”
Social distancing, Murthy argued, “is really a misnomer,” preferring to use the term “physical distancing” to signal continued social togetherness. The two instructed webinar participants to help by staying home but remaining connected with others.
Chen suggested buying gift cards from local businesses as a way to support them.
Beyond their recommendations, Murthy repeatedly called the current circumstances a chance for growth and deepened relationships.
“Every crisis we face is an opportunity to reassess our values and this is no different,” Murthy said.

With students forced to vacate campus as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Divest Harvard — a student group calling for the University to divest from fossil fuels — said in a Friday press release that the impact of climate change bears similarities to the ongoing outbreak and pledged to continue its efforts.
Over the past several years, Divest Harvard has become a dominant activist groups on campus, garnering national attention for demonstrations to call attention to Harvard’s investment in the fossil fuel industry.
The group wrote that those affected by the coronavirus are also likely those bearing the brunt of climate change.
“The marginalized and low-income communities that are most impacted by the effects of COVID-19 are the same communities that are at the highest risk of climate disaster,” the press release reads.
Divest Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
The press release states that the group supported the University’s decision to quickly move most students, faculty, and staff off campus.
“The administration proved that it can act with urgency if it wants to, and we support their general decision to rapidly upend the status quo when necessary,” it reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Divest Harvard's statement.
In the press release, Divest Harvard also charged that the University would be financially better off during a potential future period of economic downturn if it had divested from the fossil fuel industry in 2019. Experts say that a potential recession as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak could pose serious financial risks for Harvard’s endowment.
When the University of California’s school system announced plans to divest from the fossil fuel industry in October 2019, administrators cited the financial risk of the industry as a factor in their decision.
Harvard Management Spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the group’s allegations, citing HMC’s policy not to comment on individual investments.
Harvard is better prepared for a potential economic downturn now than it was for the 2008 recession, according to Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister.
Divest Harvard closed the press release by reiterating its plans to continue their activism remotely.
“We’ll continue to mobilize and fight for a more resilient world, because in crises like these, there is not the luxury of remaining on the sidelines,” the release reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 1, 12:04 p.m.
Scientists at Harvard’s Wyss Institute and the Broad Institute have begun new research on technologies for diagnostic testing of the novel coronavirus, according to two articles published on the institutes’ respective websites last week.
The initiatives come in response to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, which had caused more than 160,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths in the United States as of Tuesday evening. Wyss scientists have also begun projects to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and replacements for personal protective equipment.
Donald E. Ingber, the founding director of the Wyss Institute, said his team’s shortest-term diagnostic technology is to use their “organ-on-a-chip” to see if existing FDA-approved drugs may help combat COVID-19.
“These are microfluidic culture devices lined by human cells,” he said. “We were funded by DARPA, under a program that was called PREPARE that was really focused on being prepared to deal with viral pandemics.”
Using the organ on chips, Ingber’s team was previously able to mimic human systemic responses to various strains of influenza. That research proved critical when the lab quickly transitioned into developing diagnostic and therapeutic inventions to combat the coronavirus, he said.
“When the COVID-19 crisis emerged in January, my team very quickly pivoted and engineered a pseudo-type virus,” Ingber said.
Deborah T. Hung ’88, co-director of the Broad Institute’s Infectious Diseases and Microbiome Program, said the Institute is uniquely suited for running patient diagnostics due to its status as a “CLIA certified laboratory.” Hung said researchers at the Broad have been working on several new technologies and testing methods.
“There’s a lot of different ones that are being discussed out there,” she said. “[There is a] certain CRISPR enzyme called Cas13 — enzymes which can cleave RNA and be turned to infectious disease diagnostics.”
That technology could allow researchers to develop a COVID-19 test that could generate results in under an hour and cost ten dollars per test.
The technology adds to a growing repertoire of new initiatives from the Wyss Institute, including a special face mask and additional diagnostics that target blood antibodies. Ingber said the latter could be crucial during the endgame of the pandemic.
Though the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic continue to change on a daily basis, Hung noted that the collective effort the situation has prompted may have positive lasting effects on the scientific community.
“I’m very encouraged by everybody’s willingness to step up and try to play a role. It’s creating communities that are interacting in new ways,” Hung said. “It’s resulting in collaboration between scientists working together.”
“And hopefully, that all this effort will actually pay off to somehow lessen the impact of the pandemic,” she added.
Ingber agreed, citing the importance of scientific collaboration.
“There are no armies that are going to defend us in this war. It’s going to be physicians, engineers, and scientists,” Ingber said.
Correction: April 1, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Wyss Institute's "organ-on-a-chip" technology is being used to diagnose COVID-19. In fact, it is being used to examine whether certain drugs might serve as therapies for COVID-19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark D. Gearan ’78, director of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School, said in a Tuesday interview that the IOP is working to transition its extensive programming to an online model.
In addition to putting its popular JFK Jr. Forums online as “Fast Forums,” the IOP is also switching its Resident Fellows program to an online version dubbed “Fellows and Headlines.” The program traditionally invites six “prominent public servants” to mentor and host events for undergraduates. In the online program, fellows will instead talk politics and service over Zoom conference calls. Fellows will also occasionally do question-and-answer sessions on the IOP’s Instagram account.
Gearan said he and his colleagues knew they wanted to continue the IOP’s offerings while remaining flexible as they responded to the disruption of students being asked to leave campus to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
One goal was to “maintain a sense of community among our students.” Another was “to provide opportunities for students to continue their engagement in civic life, politics, and public service,” according to Gearan.
“We said at the beginning, we need to be flexible and nimble in our efforts,” he said.
Other student-led IOP programs, like the Harvard Political Union, the Campaigns and Advocacy Program, and the Harvard Votes Challenge, will also continue with virtual programming.
“It is a different format. There's nothing like face-to-face and the intimacy of study groups or being live at the JFK Jr. Forum here,” he said. “But I think — given the importance of the issues that we're talking about, given our students’ real interests in civic and political life — this is our approach to maximizing the opportunities they have to engage in these questions.”
Gearan said those at the IOP were “very pleased” with attendance at the inaugural “Fast Forum.”
As of Tuesday, around 300 people had RSVP'd for the upcoming “Fast Forum” with NBC White House correspondent Peter M. Alexander on Thursday, according to IOP spokesperson Kelsey A. Donohue.
“We are getting a lot of admitted students, so students who are members of the Class of 2024,” Donohue said of those planning to attend. “Which I think is a great way that we've seen that the virtual format allows for different populations of the Harvard community to engage.”
Gearan added that the IOP is “very much looking forward” to participating in the Virtual Visitas to welcome the Class of 2024.
“We're right in the midst of thinking through how we can best deliver that opportunity to show prospective students, newly admitted students, how they can find a home for their civic and political interests when they hopefully arrive at Harvard,” he said.
Gearan also said the IOP has yet to make a final decision on the organization’s plentiful summer opportunities, including its popular Director’s Internships or the Summer in Washington Program
“We don't have final decisions both from the University as well as with some of the partners that we’re working with,” he said. “We have been in touch with our partners, as they’re thinking through it as well. But guidance from the College — we expect it to be forthcoming on some of these questions, so we’re awaiting that, as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With restaurants struggling across the nation and healthcare workers working around the clock, Isabella M. Di Pietro ’20 and her family were inspired to start an organization that provides a way to support those frontline healthcare workers — while keeping the family restaurant business afloat.
The organization, called “Feed the Frontlines," was inspired by the mounting pressures restaurants face under social distancing guidelines. Di Pietro’s father owns and operates the Italian restaurant chain Tarallucci e Vino in New York City. When Governor Andrew M. Cuomo ordered restaurants to stop offering dine-in services, her father was forced to close four of his restaurant’s five locations and lay off almost all of his employees.
Then a friend gave them an idea: what if there was a way to keep the restaurants running while also supporting frontline healthcare workers? With the help of several other Harvard seniors, Di Pietro launched a fundraising campaign online and began to spread the word on social media.
“I started to talk to many of my friends who were sitting at home, feeling anxious, nervous, and often bored and trying to find a way to do something from where we sit,” she said.
The initiative got off the ground quickly and raised over $50,000 by the second night, according to Di Pietro. She said she was overwhelmed by the amount of phone calls she received from hospital coordinators who wanted to place orders.
Despite the chaos, the family found the new work rewarding. Di Pietro said her dad felt “like Santa Claus” when he did one of the first few deliveries.
It costs $25 to donate a meal, which includes the cost of food, wages for restaurant workers, and delivery. The organization had raised more than $500,000 and served a total of 6,750 meals to 13 different hospitals as of Tuesday night. The average donation is under $200, according to Di Pietro.
As a result of the fundraising, Tarallucci e Vino has been able to bring back 30 of its workers and reopen another of its locations dedicated solely to meeting demand for Feed the Frontlines.
Eleonore L. Evans ’20, one of four other Harvard seniors helping with the initiative, said that the work has made her feel empowered her to make a difference during the crisis.
“For me personally, it’s hard to be at home, not able to go anywhere and feel like so much of this pandemic is out of your control,” she said. “This is a great way that I feel like I’m doing just a small thing to help those who are in a much tougher position than I am.”
Evans, a History and Literature concentrator, is helping with marketing and social media efforts. She said that engaging in public service while at Harvard had shown her the “power of young people with a mission and a goal.”
Feed the Frontlines sister organizations have also sprung up in Boston and Toronto, inspired by the organization’s success in New York City. Di Pietro said that the New York City-based operation is considering filing paperwork to become a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
Di Pietro said that managing Feed the Frontlines has taken up almost all of her time and energy, and that she’s considering taking the remainder of the semester off in order to focus on the organization.
“I fall asleep at it at night. I’m usually woken up by a call in the morning,” she said.
“I’m still showing up on Zoom when I need to be on Zoom,” she added. “It’s hard for me to set aside this work which feels so pressing.”
Correction: April 1, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Di Pietro's organization has filed paperwork to become a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit. In fact, the organization is considering doing so.

On Jan. 24, days before the start of the spring semester, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen informed Harvard affiliates in an email that the University would monitor the spread of COVID-19 coming out of Wuhan, China.
Practically speaking, though, he wrote that the flu posed a larger threat on campus than the novel coronavirus.
“As students arrive back on campus and we find ourselves in the midst of cold and flu season, I want to remind you to be vigilant in taking precautions to prevent the spread of illnesses,” Nguyen wrote.
Nguyen’s email marked the first of many Harvard undergraduates would receive about the coronavirus. At first, they concerned Harvard’s centers and activities in far off places.
But while students received emails about travel restrictions and hygiene tips, behind the scenes, College administrators began to discuss more extreme changes the virus might bring about on campus.
Less than two months later, those changes came to pass. On March 10, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote a different kind of message to students: one telling undergraduates Harvard would require them to vacate campus within a week.
A little more than a week after Nguyen’s January email about the coronavirus and the flu, the former arrived in Massachusetts. Nguyen and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 informed affiliates in a Feb. 2 email that the first case had appeared at the University of Massachusetts Boston after one of its students returned to campus from Wuhan.
Still, Nguyen and Garber reiterated that the risk of Harvard affiliates contracting the virus was low.
“This is an evolving situation to which Harvard, public health officials, and government agencies are responding in real time, and Harvard may impose new requirements if warranted by changing circumstances,” they wrote.
As those emails entered students’ inboxes, the College’s senior leadership team was engaging in an annual emergency simulation exercise with other University administrators, Khurana said in a Tuesday interview.
Exercises like the ones they ran allow the College to flex its bureaucratic muscles and implement a central framework of values and priorities, which Khurana said ultimately guided each step of the College’s preparations for the potential threat of the coronavirus on campus.
“Since we began monitoring the virus, and that started months back, we in the College basically outlined three values around which we would be making decisions related to the virus,” he said.
In those early days, the College’s “foremost” value was to prioritize community health and well-being. The second was to react to the crisis “proportionally.” The third was to follow official guidelines “not just in letter but in spirit.”
“We wanted to be careful not to overreact, but we also didn't want to under-react,” Khurana said.
On Feb. 29, Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates that there had still been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Harvard affiliates. He added that the College’s emergency response team was working closely with HUHS, Global Support Services, and other University offices in order to be prepared.
Days later, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay encouraged faculty and staff to begin “contingency planning” for their daily activities in an March 4 email.
“For faculty who may have never used Zoom for teaching, this is a good time to try it out and to get training,” she wrote.
Behind the scenes, Khurana said he was holding “regular calls” with faculty deans and other members of the FAS about contingency planning for the crisis.
“One of the things that we would do is we would go back to our variety of stakeholders, whether it's from the residential, from the educational, from the staff perspective, share what we had learned, understand what their perspectives were, what questions needed to be addressed, what were the ideas they had for addressing certain concerns, and then that itself would become the input for subsequent phone calls,” he said.
As College figures met, coronavirus-related emails sent to College affiliates began to accumulate.
March 4 marked the inauguration of Harvard’s biweekly coronavirus updates, which Harvard College Emergency Management Team co-director Michael "Mike" P. Burke announced he would send every Monday and Thursday afternoon.
Burke added that the College would keep four dining halls open during spring break to accommodate students who had decided to alter their plans to travel and instead remain on campus — a move that, coupled with the changing situation abroad, caused many students to cancel their flights home.
Over the next week, the College axed several large in-person events. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 informed admitted students in a March 6 email that the College had canceled Visitas, its annual admitted students weekend, moving to a virtual model for the class of 2024. Three days later, Burke announced that Harvard would indefinitely postpone Housing Day — an annual event in which freshmen students are assigned to an upperclassmen house.
But the next morning, students received news that dwarfed those cancellations. After months of simulations, strategy calls, and incremental changes, the College took dramatic action.
Shortly before 9 a.m. on March 10, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote to affiliates on March 10 that Harvard courses would move to remote instruction beginning March 23 as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
“Students are asked not to return to campus after Spring Recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice," Bacow wrote. "Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions.”
Perhaps even more consequentially, Khurana followed Bacow’s email with one that spelled out a clear message for undergraduates: they were to evacuate campus by Sunday.
Resident Dean of Winthrop House Linda D. M. Chavers said the College informed resident deans of an imminent undergraduate evacuation just 12 hours before it was announced to students.
Similarly, Quincy House Faculty Dean Lee Gehrke said in a March 21 interview that, though faculty deans had participated in discussions about coronavirus contingency plans, they were not privy to the final decision to have students continue courses remotely for the rest of the semester.
“I think the information that we got is very similar to yours,” Gehrke said. “My assessment of that is just built on looking at the emails that we got as faculty deans and looking at students’ and they're essentially the same thing, nearly identical.”
Students spent the narrow window of five days in a state of whiplash, frantically packing up their belongings, arranging transport home, bidding hasty goodbyes to friends, and partying. Seniors processed the potential loss of their graduation, athletes grieved the loss of their sports seasons, and many first-generation, low-income students panicked about the impending loss of on-campus jobs that had financially supported themselves and their families.
Khurana said he is unable to pin down any “key moment” in the spring semester when administrators arrived at their unprecedented decision to evacuate undergraduates. Instead, he said he largely remembered the framework that guided it.
Though Khurana called the decision “historic,” he added that the College had previously developed a robust system of emergency protocols to handle outbreaks of other “rapid, infectious” diseases like SARS and mumps.
Khurana said that though “hindsight is 20/20,” he stands by the decision.
“We’d rather be critiqued for doing too much too soon than too little too late,” he said.

With professors running overtime, our social hangouts restricted to Houseparty, and TikTok as our only source of entertainment, we’re looking at our screens more now than ever — if that’s even possible. Here’s how to avoid a massive headache after all this screen time!
Night Shift
If you want a quick and easy way to reduce blue light, set up Night Shift on your computer and phone. It will give your screen a slightly yellowish tint that blocks out the blue light that gives you headaches.
Blue Light Glasses
Alternatively, if you want to spice up your look to impress your Zoom crush, you can get special glasses that will filter out the blue light while also making you feel like a true academic — even with classes that are all SAT/UNSAT.
Take Frequent Breaks
We don’t need another excuse to procrastinate, so let’s call it “self-care.” But instead of scrolling through Instagram, put your phone down and take a walk outside or read a chapter of a book you’ve been promising you’d finish since freshman year. If you don’t have time to do that, follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
Work in a Well Lit Area
As much as we want to be writing our essays at 3 a.m. under the covers with all the lights turned off, working in a dark room with laptops isn’t great for your eyes. If you have to pull an all nighter to grind out that paper you have due first thing tomorrow, make sure to turn on the lights to reduce eye strain.
Though we have to basically always be on our screens during quarantine, it doesn’t have to come with a migraine. And hey, with the new SAT/UNSAT grading standards, at least our grades aren’t giving us headaches anymore — just our screens!
