“Every Day Is Exactly The Same,” Nine Inch Nails
Nine Inch Nails’ 2005 rock hit somehow captured exactly what it feels like to wake up and realize it’s already March 225th. “I believe I can see the future / 'Cause I repeat the same routine,” Trent Reznor sings over a haunting background, and it’s as if he, too, knows what it feels like to have your week ruled by Zoom fatigue and endless Twitter doom scrolls.
“Ball of Confusion (That’s What the World Is Today),” The Temptations
While the title of this Temptations’ track itself is enough to merit a spot on this list, “Ball of Confusion” also discusses many of the political issues that have become increasingly difficult to ignore as the presidential election draws nearer all while the pandemic rages on. The song discusses racism, economic injustice, drug crises, and cities on fire in the summertime — all while The Temptations’ smooth voices melt seamlessly into the groovy motown melody.
“I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times,” The Beach Boys
Was anyone made for these times, really? “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times” is the type of song that makes you nostalgic for a feeling that you never really had. The Beach Boys’ iconic harmonies softly lull you to sleep as they sing about the grief that comes from wanting to change things and not being able to: “Every time I get the inspiration / To go change things around / No one wants to help me look for places / Where new things might be found.”
“Killing in the Name Of,” Rage Against the Machine
Any of Rage Against the Machine’s songs can make up the ideal soundtrack for protest, but 1992’s “Killing in the Name Of” seems particularly poised for the moment. In the track, vocalist Zack de la Rocha raps about the realities of police brutality and the police force’s connections to white supremacist ideology. As the Movement for Black Lives protests against these very same problems 30 years later (and new reports have come out citing the ways that white supremacists have infiltrated police forces nationwide), the track proves incredibly resonant for the now. Rage’s distinctly powerful musicality — levied by Tom Morello’s sludgy guitar riffs — only adds to the song’s weight.
“American Idiot,” Green Day
Somehow, the title feels apt for a president who chooses to go maskless and plan in-person events while knowingly harboring a deadly (and contagious) virus. The 2000s-era punk rockers originally wrote the song as a scathing critique of George W. Bush’s America, but to say that the lyrics don’t apply equally well to the current occupant of the White House? Well… let’s just say that there’s a reason that 14 years after its release, Green Day’s anthem rose to number one on the U.K. charts ahead of President Trump’s 2018 visit.
“It’s The End Of World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine),” R.E.M.
Unfortunately, this song has never felt so accurate, so it would be wrong not to include the classic “everything is a disaster” anthem at the close of this list. Even more unfortunately, the hodge podge of stream-of-consciousness lyrics about the world ending don’t seem that catastrophic anymore. Still, as the Movement for Black Lives continues and more Americans start to grapple with the racial and economic inequalities that for too long have formed the basis of our society, maybe the end of the world as we know it isn’t such a bad thing?
Bonus:
“I am the Fly,” Wire
Wire’s incredibly eloquent lyrics — “I am the fly, I am the fly, I am the fly, I am the fly” — give listeners the chance to live out their dreams as the true highlight of the vice presidential debate: the fly on Mike Pence’s head. What more could you want to describe the current moment?

Whether you’re a seasoned podcast lover or you’re simply using the medium to seem more interesting for an upcoming date, you’ve come to the right place! Here are Crimson Arts’s top five recommendations for must-listen podcasts.
“Stuff You Should Know”
Hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W. "Chuck" Bryant, “Stuff You Should Know” (SYSK) is an educational podcast that covers everything from urban planning to psychological disorders to failed Hitler assasination plots. In the span of 40-or-so minutes, Josh and Chuck deliver entertaining and engaging, yet nuanced and well-researched topic overviews. So, the next time you find yourself bored with your day-to-day routine, think about the systems that enable even the simplest tasks we all might take for granted — or the most random historical artifact you once heard about in high school — and chances are SYSK has an episode about it. The show also does a great job with objective treatments of controversial issues (see “Is Vaping Really Bad for You?” “How Lobbying Works” or “How the Electoral College Works”), so it’s a great resource for getting your facts straight before a politically charged conversation. And if you still don’t know where to start, just scroll through the 12-year history of the podcast, and something is sure to catch your eye.
“How I Built This”
On “How I Built This,” host Guy Raz interviews the world’s forefront “innovators, entrepreneurs, and idealists” to tell the story of how their businesses got their start. The show has interviewed some representatives from the world’s top brands —Instagram, VICE, Lyft, Instacart, Slack, LinkedIn, and many more — but the primary draw for many listeners is learning how extraordinary moguls persevered through extreme adversity or otherwise challenging circumstances. This is not necessarily the case with every single episode — for example, Instagram’s straightforward story involves little more than the launch of the platform and its purchase by Facebook. However, some great episodes on this front — Tate’s Bake Shop, Wikipedia, Duolingo, and Airbnb — are definitely worth the listen.
“Rabbit Hole”
“Rabbit Hole” is an eight-episode series from The New York Times, in which journalist Kevin Roose presents a year of research into how the internet shapes our lives. The series takes the case study of one man’s Youtube history to explain how the platform’s AI algorithm led him “down the rabbit hole” of far-right radicalization. In episode four, Roose interviews Youtube CEO Susan Wojcicki on how the company is addressing this phenomenon of algorithmic radicalization. This analysis of YouTube then serves as a springboard for more general discussions of internet culture and its far-reaching effects on society. The show unearths the deep web forums where conspiracies like “Pizza Gate” and QAnon first took hold and details the rise of internet sensation Pewdiepie, interviewing him about a controversy over an anti-semetic video on his channel. “Rabbit Hole” should be listened to sequentially, but the edge-of-your-seat tone of Roose’s revelations will make the series’ eight episodes fly by. The show was released as a response to the beginning of “quarantine” (which should honestly by now be recognized as a formal historical period), so it couldn’t be more relevant to our lives today.
“The Next Big Idea”
“The Next Big Idea” was developed by host Rufus Griscom with writers and scholars including Malcolm Gladwell, Susan Cain, Adam Grant, and Daniel Pink. In each episode Griscom interviews the author of a recent book that the team has identified as “the next big idea” in business, science, health, or culture. The show answers questions like “What makes us happy?” “How can we become less distractible?” and “Why do we have racial bias and what can we do about it?” In the hour long show, Griscom and an author-interviewee summarize the author’s new concept and explore its implications in our lives. In this way the show appeals to readers and nonreaders alike, intriguing some enough that they might pick up the book, but at the same time giving less literary listeners enough information that they don’t really need to read it themselves. Wherever you fall, “The Next Big Idea” is certain to give you a new perspective on life.
“This American Life”
“This American Life” is more or less the defining work of the podcast medium. It was even the first radio show to ever win a Pulitzer Prize in May. Each episode has a loosely defined theme that’s introduced at the beginning by host Ira Glass. Then, the show proceeds in several “acts,” in each of which interviewees tell a different story that fits the theme, usually in the form of a first person narrative. The episodes range from hard-hitting journalism to sentimental memories to funny stories to harrowing tales and more. The show first aired in 1995 and since then has produced over 700 episodes, so it's hard to know where to start. To this end, you can check out ‘New to This American Life?,’ a list curated by the creators themselves, or listen to my favorites first: “Really Long Distance,” about a phone booth in Japan that is said to allow people to communicate with loved ones lost in the 2011 tsunami and earthquake, and “Go to the Mattress,” about a woman who grew up in America but was kidnapped and held in captivity in Pakistan without any relics of her past life, except for a copy of “Little Women” she hid under her mattress. If all else fails and choosing a first episode seems too daunting, at the very least watch this episode of HBO’s High Maintenance, which takes quite an interesting look into the production of “This American Life.”

There is a distinct physicality to engaging with art in a museum. Careful not to step in too close and sound the mortifying alarm, one peers at jagged strokes of acrylic or the luminous contours of an ancient pot. It is this physical proximity — this closeness to a piece so seemingly accessible yet elusive — that lends wonder, passion, and intellectual challenge to the experience of viewing art.
What, then, are the implications for art during the era of COVID-19? How can museums preserve the revelatory, deeply private experience of artistic engagement in a time of mass digitization?
The Art Institute of Chicago, commonly lauded as downtown Chicago’s — and the world’s — best museum, faced the same challenge as all of its counterparts following the pandemic: how to best maintain intimate access to artistic masterworks in a cold, pixelated cyberspace. In response, they demonstrated a singular capacity to capitalize on a bad situation.
Certain setbacks are inevitable. Visitors can no longer glimpse the oxidized hides of the two bronze lions guarding the museum’s entrance on Michigan Avenue. They cannot dine on lemon-herb tofu within the panoramic glass walls of Terzo Piano, nor can they buy a gift shop mug embossed with the bold geometry of a Mondrian.
Since the museum is only open during select hours, new initiatives promote digital engagement to suit at-home schedules. “Monet and Chicago,” an exhibition that runs until Jan. 18, 2021, is complemented by videos detailing the artist’s exacting artistic techniques. One such video, titled “Discovering Monet | Beyond the Surface,” expounds his role in shaping Impressionism. Interspersed with ruminations from Monet’s personal letters, the video depicts conservators’ use of infrared imagery to track the chronology of paint strokes, providing viewers a privileged glimpse into the Parisian’s artistic process.
A subpage on the museum’s website titled “Interactive Features” allows digital visitors to learn the historical context behind pieces. A virtual dialogue on El Greco’s iconic “The Assumption of the Virgin” describes its journey from a convent in Toledo, Spain, to Chicago. A string of paragraphs detail the nuanced iconography of a Chinese bell or “nao” from roughly 1046 BCE dubbed the “Sound of Heaven.” As one scrolls down the page, the bell turns slowly, simulating a viewer’s circular orbit around the ancient artifact.
Perhaps most representative of the museum’s offerings is “The Collection,” an information-rich archive of all possessed works. From Vincent van Gogh’s “The Bedroom” to George Seurat’s “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte,” Pablo Picasso’s “The Old Guitarist” to Katsushika Hokusai’s “Under the Wave off Kanagawa,” “The Collection” boasts some of the world’s most coveted masterpieces.
A digital museum experience lends viewers the unique opportunity to completely control the pace of their artistic journeys. At in-person museums, one can linger over paintings — especially famous ones — for only so long before receiving miffed glances from fellow visitors or shouldering one’s way out of a claustrophobic crowd. Here, however, there is an audience of one: All materials revolve around the singular viewer who has entered the digital exhibit’s impersonal yet deeply private space.
Digitized art exemplifies a classic quarantine ambivalence. Though increased online access has served as a broad equalizer, excessive online activity can be exhausting and reductive. The Art Institute of Chicago’s digital offerings eliminate obstacles such as transportation and membership fees that could discourage in-person visitation. At the same time, expanded availability dulls the allure of the experience: There is no longer one “Greyed Rainbow” by Jackson Pollock in the museum’s Gallery 291 but, rather, countless pixelated facsimiles glowing on screens around the world.
The physical experience of exploring an art museum occasionally induces a state of focused, rhapsodic buoyancy. Time as we know it assumes an element of surreality, humming with the wonder and affective complexities evoked by art. Processing a piece in person is like being in conversation with an entity that speaks an inaccessible language but still manages to provoke visceral awe.
Though digital offerings are incomparable to the traditional art museum experience, it is possible to alchemize time from the comfort — or confines — of home. Quarantine has blended the hours into an indiscriminate soup of exhaustion, responsibilities, and ennui. By opening our laptops not to respond to emails or haphazardly complete a paper by its midnight deadline but, rather, engage with an art museum’s digital offerings, we can slow down and revel in a sense of intense inquiry. The challenging, non-linear reflection that art demands can breathe life into our newly flattened relationships with time.
French artist Paul Gauguin once said, “I shut my eyes in order to see.” Indeed, the pandemic has forced people and entire countries — perhaps even the global community at large — to shut their eyes in countless ways. From this disorientation and blindness, however, emerge new ways of seeing, of making use of what remains.
It is likely that when the quarantine ends and people venture into the world, they will encounter ordinary things as if for the first time: a coffee at the local cafe, a leisurely stroll along the shores of a beach, a room full of art enjoyed in the animal warmth of other contemplative souls.
When that time comes, people will flock to museums. Until then, individuals will have to seek revelation through the uncanny, intriguing world of digital art. The Art Institute of Chicago has affirmed that even in this time of necessary isolation, engaging with art can remain a singular and sacred experience.

“These are ordinary people, Bob. And for some reason, people are captivated by their ordinariness,” says a PR rep to a NASA official in the second episode of “The Right Stuff.”
If only that were the case.
National Geographic’s new historical drama, centered on the origins of America’s space program and the race to launch man into the stars, includes everything you would hope to find in a worthwhile mid-century period piece — storytelling that complicates the historical narrative of American innovation, acknowledgement of global ideological conflict, etc. — yet it fails to deliver an experience grander than the sum of its parts, leaving an aftertaste of profound ordinariness.
“The Right Stuff” follows the journey of the Mercury Seven — the seven pilots selected by NASA to fly the nation’s first spacecraft — as they’re catapulted into national celebritydom. The nascent space agency and their seven future astronauts, spearheaded by two conflicting personalities in pilots John Glenn (Patrick J. Adams) and Alan Shepard (Jake McDorman), are tasked with navigating a uniquely turbulent Cold War setting as well as equally turbulent home lives that encroach on their monumental ambitions.
Glenn — a storied veteran with a killer smile and a spot on every popular magazine’s front page — further enchants God-fearing, Soviet-hating America, but his lust for glory clashes with the threat of old age and irrelevance. Shepard — a daredevil pilot with an eye for alcohol, women, and everything fast — complements Glenn’s character with drive and know-how, but his reckless approach to life looms over his confidence and the image of stability. Where “The Right Stuff” succeeds is portraying these highly personal struggles within the context of national legacy and international rivalry, but the show’s storytelling fails to elevate itself beyond the setting, trapped by a drabness that hedges on cliche.
Capturing the remarkable ethos of late-’50s-to-early-’60s America is no small task, and “The Right Stuff” steps up to the challenge with moderate success. While perhaps burdened by overt exclamations of the Russian threat, subtle yet carefully crafted moments of storytelling endow the show with an immersive quality. Comparisons between politicians and Hollywood actors reveal the showmanship of progress. Exasperated phone calls between bureaucrats reveal the personal interests underlying the web of funding and paperwork sustaining NASA. In this world, supporting the anti-socialist agenda, and the act of proving it, is everything.
Perhaps the most intriguing reference comes in a speech Shepard delivers while on a publicity tour. The pilot promises to “kick the snot out of the Soviets, for freedom,” before remembering to add “for God, also.” What exactly is America going to space for? Who shares in its success? “The Right Stuff” takes on these big questions brilliantly, letting them manifest in the idiosyncrasies of each character: America’s divine exceptionalism finds a name in John Glenn, it’s chauvinism and inner turmoil in Alan Shepard.
Yet this sophisticated weave of personal and national identities is diminished by moments of startling bluntness, and attention on the overt lingers. A conversation between wives of astronauts in the second episode about sacrifices made for their husbands’ careers reveals the expectation that women take a backseat in society. While an important moment that speaks to the complex mid-century social atmosphere, it almost feels like a form of tokenizing — a gratuitous sequence copied and pasted from some other source on the voices of women in the ’50s and ’60s, injected into the script out of a desire to cover bases rather than genuinely address the subject. That conversation is treated more as a bridge the show must cross before returning to the astronauts themselves, who remain perpetually indifferent to the scenes that precede them.
The triumphs of “The Right Stuff” are reduced by this attitude of filling in gaps rather than exploring details rich with potential. There’s a friction between the emphasis on the grand and the lackluster visuals, for example. Despite making such a big deal out of the intensity of it all — the vastness of space, the magnitude of the mission’s consequences, the intricacy of the astronauts’ emotions — the show is furnished with rather unexciting color palettes and set pieces. Between the bare-bones office spaces, the standard-issue suits, and the reliance on a color spectrum of gray to khaki, the show feels more like an exercise in throat-clearing than anything else.
The dullness, diffuse and unshakable, is accentuated by a script that doesn’t know how to state anything but the obvious. One pilot, searching for words to describe the opportunity in front of him, settles on “It’s space, Trudy. It’s space.” A compelling explanation, I know. Rather than utilizing such components of television as coloring or dialogue to enhance the story, “The Right Stuff” fails to add depth or texture with anything beyond material that could be found in a textbook.
“The Right Stuff” checks off all the boxes. But as the NASA officials who selected the Mercury Seven suggest, becoming one of the first ever astronauts and shouldering the weight of the American Cold War effort requires more than just checking off the boxes. Launching a rocket, or a hit new TV show for that matter, requires an intangible, an X factor, a certain amount of “the right stuff.” And so far, despite the name, the show is running low on it.

“Ringarde!”
Meaning “basic” in French, the word is often used to describe the titular Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) in Netflix’s “Emily in Paris.” Thankfully, for a show about an expat American fashion designer, the series isn’t quite as “ringarde” as it may seem.
Emily, a marketing executive from Chicago, moves to a Parisian marketing firm to provide an American perspective. The show’s plot is, for the most part, what one expects. Emily’s encounters with French men, the trajectory of her work, and her general attitude towards Parisian life feel like an overplayed rom-com. And yet, while it is not the most binge-worthy show, there are small moments of enjoyment and humor — Emily fumbling to pay in coins at a bakery, technical hiccups during cybersex, a family dinner full of unintended innuendos — that keep one invested in the show.
The show has its fair share of flaws, not least of which is its implausibility. It conforms to the typical, overdramatic nature of rom-coms, and some plot points are just too coincidental. Emily’s character is unrealistically cheerful, seemingly unfazed by either a new country or a new boss who despises her. What makes the show even less believable are the constant coincidences in the plot. Whether it’s a stranger helping Emily buy flowers or a nanny whose kids knock down her baguette, a good chunk of Emily’s friendships are products of pure chance.
It’s not just the relationships themselves that are a little too coincidental. With few exceptions, characters seem to drift in and out of the story, temporary “filler” characters whose sole purpose seems to be to (very blatantly) catalyze some event or put Emily through some struggle. Whether it be her coworkers, her boss from the American office, or a man Emily meets at a party that only wants to get in her pants, a surprisingly large amount of the cast lacks multidimensional personality and their relationships with Emily feel half-baked.
In fact, half-baked is the threadline of Emily’s character development — she almost seems to move backwards. Despite several positive influences (including her boss, Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu)) Emily falls into many sticky situations by the end of the show, betraying many of her friends. Her failure to learn from Sylvie’s confidence and guidance or to respect her friends make Emily’s growth counterproductive and her character (a supposed innocent, goody-two-shoes) harder to trust.
The portrayal of social media is also deeply superficial; Emily magically gains followers from boring (frankly, very mediocre) captions and pretty “ringarde” selfies. Though Emily is a marketing genius for the clients she aids at the firm, she doesn’t seem to apply any of that creativity to her own account. Social media does, however, add a fresh new layer to the typical rom-com formula. The show emphasizes the effect of marketing on a product’s success and the role of social media, despite many older clients being hesitant to instill these efforts — even if Emily’s older coworkers don’t buy in. Emily herself, when prompted to delete her Instagram account for work, fondly referred to her account as a way of guidance and documentation: “I’m not sure who I am in this city without ‘@emilyinparis.’”
The show also reveals several differences between French and American culture, some of which hold merit and some of which conform to cringey clichés. In the first episode, Emily’s new coworker, Luc (Bruno Gouery), approaches her with a pointed observation: “I think the Americans have the wrong balance. You live to work. We work to live.” Other aspects of French culture, from the termination process which discourages workers from getting fired to French wives acknowledging their husband’s mistresses, are well-incorporated. Yet, other facets fall short in their execution: clichés like hostile waiters, berets, and lustful French men reveal the show to be a very limited American idea of French culture. These clichés fail to make meaningful commentary on the difference between French and American culture and rarely go deeper than a stereotype.
The show also seems to comment on its own banality in episode seven, when Luc and Julien (Samuel Arnold) are uninterested in the arrival of an American actress. They call American rom-coms “dishonest,” explaining that French endings in film are much more “tragic” and thus “more like life,” concluding, “Happy endings are very American.” Emily says that this is the point of movies — to escape life — and Luc calls this the American problem: “You can never escape life. Never.”
Perhaps, then, “Emily in Paris” is meant to be just what Emily defines rom-coms to be — an escape from life. It’s not an incredibly existentialist, what’s-the-meaning-of-life show, and neither is it particularly realistic. Her overly-colorful, not-very-French outfits, designed by “Sex and the City” costume designer Patricia Field, add to this cliché. And yet, the show still has its charming moments, particularly when it doesn’t take itself seriously. At its best, Emily’s adventure paints a rosier picture of life, one which she sweeps us along into.
Though it might not quite earn it, the show — as an avenue of escape from reality — is one that holds value when the world falls to chaos. And in a time where we’re so isolated, we could all stand to be transported to Paris and enjoy a little cheesy, rom-com fun.

It usually is not hard to find organized sports on Harvard’s campus on a given term-time day. Throughout the year, shoes screech in Lavietes Pavilion, pucks fly in Bright-Landry Hockey Center, and the sound of a coxswain’s call echoes around the banks of the Charles River. But this year is different. On July 8, the Ivy League made the difficult decision to cancel fall sports for the year 2020. Crimson athletes are no longer zooming on scooters through the yard, but rather zooming into Harvard online from all across the world.
Despite the coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent restrictions on college athletics, sports at Harvard have not disappeared. They have simply moved to a different arena: the classroom. Now, if one were to look for Crimson sports on “campus,” they would have to look no further than Zach Nowak and the history department.
Dr. Zachary Nowak is a beloved professor. His students know and refer to him as Zach. Junior Maddie Heilbrun of the swim and dive team jokes that she is only a couple classes short of a secondary in “Nowak-ian Studies” — that is, a four-class history secondary made up of exclusively classes taught by Professor Nowak.
Like many of Professor Nowak’s classes, History 1852 is a 101 — an introductory level class. Its goal, as well as one of Professor Nowak’s, is to teach historical methodology. But as Professor Nowak frankly states, “there are 0 people who would take a class called historical methodology, myself included!” He thus sought to teach historical methodology through a unique lens that would bring new and excited students to the history department.
The sports community at Harvard — athletes and enthusiasts alike — was the perfect target. Professor Nowak used his contacts in the athletic community to get the word out about his new class, and even scheduled the class from 7:30-8:45 p.m. EST on Tuesday and Thursday nights to accommodate athletic training schedules. The class is largely made up of, though in no way limited to, student-athletes. From men’s basketball to women’s crew, roughly 50% of the students are student-athletes. Sports enthusiasts and perhaps concentrators in Nowak-ian studies make up the other 50%.
For reasons that were in part promotional, Professor Nowak happened into creating a space for Crimson student-athletes and sports enthusiasts to showcase their love for and interest in college sports.
Unlike many of his students, Professor Nowak does not consider himself an athlete. He played wideout on his high school football team, and by wideout, he means “so far wide-out that [he] was on the sidelines.” And more surprisingly, Professor Nowak does not even consider himself a historian of sports.
“When I told some of my friends I was going to teach sports history this fall, they were dying laughing,” Nowak said. “They thought it was hilarious. But much like my Harvard History class last year, I took a subject [that] I had some familiarity with [and] did a ton of reading over the summer preceding. But ultimately this class… is not really a history of sports in America. It’s a history of America through sports.”
The course itself, Professor Nowak says, is like a play-action pass. College sports are the faked run; the pass is historical methodology. Through the lens of college sports, students learn how to analyze and make arguments about race, class, and gender in 19th and 20th century America.
A lesson on the history of baseball at Harvard, for example, teaches students about race relations. A dive into the concept of amateurism in sport details class relations. An oral history project, which involves interviewing and documenting the history of women athletes at Radcliffe and Harvard, teaches students about the gendered reality of archival representation. If for History 1852 19th and 20th-century American history is the end, college sports are the means.
Although the gates may be locked at Harvard stadium and scooters are not littering Harvard Yard, Crimson sports are still alive. And in the most Harvard way possible, they have just moved to the classroom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July, the Ivy League became the first Division I conference to announce that there would be no fall sports in 2020. The news that there would be no annual Harvard-Yale football game, a memorable tradition of a typical fall semester, particularly struck the hearts of many incoming first-years. However, for the 31 first-years on Harvard’s football team, that meant no football at all.
Like many student-athletes across the country, Ivy League athletes considered taking leaves of absences, red-shirting, or perhaps just bracing the storm. For one first-year on Harvard’s football team, the bearing of no football presented a unique opportunity to pursue a passion of his that the typical fall football season would prevent.
Scottsdale, Ariz., native Brock Locnikar, who received All-American recognition in both football and wrestling, will focus his attention on mixed martial arts upon his leave of absence from the College in the spring.
“I’ve started training in fighting again, and I am ready to compete again,” Locnikar said. “I am planning on having five fights in this next semester.”
Locnikar has had over fifty fights in MMA, including Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai. He has traveled around the country with a fight team from Arizona that participates in amateur fights. This upcoming spring, he is set to train with Arizona’s Power MMA and Fight Ready, two gyms that have produced champions such as Ryan Bader and Henry Cejudo. While Locnikar is missing out on what would have been his first collegiate season, he views this Spring as yet another opportunity to build himself as a better athlete.
“Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, boxing, wrestling — it's just the most grueling and adrenaline-filled experience,” Locnikar said. “With the void of competition this year, it is a really great position to be in for me to pursue this.”
The two-time Arizona Linebacker of the Year believes that his training in MMA has shaped him to be the athlete he is today.
“[MMA] definitely shaped the person I am today and has had the biggest impact on all my sports because the mindset is so applicable. It really made me mentally tough and physically strong.”
Despite having the option to pursue collegiate wrestling, Locnikar, who received 18 D1 football offers, ultimately chose football. He believes that competing and training in MMA and wrestling from a young age has helped him in his performance as a football player.
“I developed a late love for football, and I feel like all of my past experiences with fighting have helped so much with the linebacker position,” Locnikar said. “[MMA] translated really well. I was able to capitalize on my skills, and I got stronger and faster as I got older.”
The Arizona Defensive Player of the Year found football on a whim, ultimately developing an affinity for the linebacker position.
“One of my friend’s dads had a team, and he recommended I try it with my background, and I fell in love with the linebacker position and the whole mentality of it,” Locnikar said. “From that point, I played football throughout high school, and have had over 350 career tackles.”
While the future of college football is yet to be determined, Locnikar, like many other athletes, looks forward to the time he gets to compete in Harvard Stadium. For now, he is focused on doing what he can to prepare for that next step.
“After I finish my collegiate career, I am definitely interested in pursuing a professional sport, whether that be MMA or football. I am kind of keeping both doors open to see which one is better for me in the future,” Locnikar said. “I just love sports and cannot imagine my life without them.”

A lot of people planned to use quarantine as an opportunity to work out every day and improve their health, or to focus themselves on aiding the fight against the novel coronavirus. Some of those people fell short of their lofty ambitions. But women’s heavyweight rower Heidi Jacobsen ‘24 managed to do both at the same time, undertaking the challenge of walking a marathon while in the process making a huge difference in her community.
Jacobsen has always been an athlete. She rowed for five years with the Connecticut Boat Club, an all-girls team based in Norwalk, Conn. Thus, staying active by going on three-mile walks with her best friend, University of Texas-Austin’s Bella Subramaniam ‘24, every day during quarantine came naturally to her. However, one day in April, as they saw their hometown of Greenwich, Conn., get hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and wanted to help the essential workers in their community, they decided to give their exercises a bigger meaning.
“We obviously saw people sort of gathering around their communities,” Jacobsen said. “There [were] a lot of efforts to help hospitals and provide PPE for essential workers. That was our inspiration, and we just wanted to provide for the essential workers — provide some funds so that they could continue doing their jobs.”
So together they thought up a route, hatched a plan, and set to work marketing their adventure, trying to gather support for their mission and, most importantly, funding for the Greenwich Hospital. Jacobsen told her friends and rowing teammates about her challenge and chronicled it all on her Instagram account. It all blew up, and ultimately, she gathered more support than she could have possibly expected.
“Once we reached out to people and told them what we were doing, they were really supportive, and once you kind of have a community of people standing behind you, it’s hard to back down from a challenge,” she noted.
Her large team of backers helped her through the marathon, texting and direct messaging her every step of the way, and as the day progressed, she drummed up even more support for her project. Meanwhile, she and Subramaniam walked by many of her friends’ homes, waving to them and making sure they kept them in their minds as motivation to continue with the challenge. Even when fatigue started to kick in, the immense support Jacobsen received grounded her and allowed her to stay focused on the bigger picture.
The bigger picture truly was massive; through her efforts, she managed to raise over $6,000 for the hospital. This money made an invaluable contribution to its COVID-19 relief fund. But the impact of her walk spread far beyond Greenwich.
“A lot of people were DM-ing us on Instagram or texting us and saying that they were doing something similar in their communities, so it kind of reached a larger audience,” Jacobsen recalled.
Jacobsen’s challenge was further inspired by other influential athletes who strive to use their platforms to impact change.
“I think you see it with certain athletes like Serena Williams or even Simone Biles,” she said. “I think people have a lot of respect for those people, and so they listen to their messages.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jake Suddleson ‘20, a former outfielder for the Crimson, hails from Pacific Palisades, Calif. He has always aspired to play in the big leagues — however, he went undrafted after his junior and senior years despite a breakout 2019 campaign and a strong start to his shortened 2020 season. According to Suddleson, although he was initially disappointed in not being drafted after his junior year, he was able to turn that disappointment into determination and worked harder than ever to break into pro ball.
“It was disappointing but also added fuel to the fire,” Suddleson said. “The only thing to do after [not getting drafted] is to keep working hard and keep playing hard because that’s all you can do.”
After going undrafted again following his senior year, it seemed that Suddleson might have to put his dream on hold for yet another year. But after this year’s draft, he was signed by the Oakland Athletics as an undrafted free agent and was set to begin the season at the team’s rookie ball affiliate in Arizona.
According to Suddleson, although he and his family were ecstatic upon receiving the phone call from the Athletics organization, he did not forget to acknowledge the work he had ahead of him.
“It was just pure joy, to be honest,” Suddleson said. “On the one hand, it’s the call you dreamt about getting as a little kid, but on the other, you realize that the work has really only just begun.”
Suddleson has broken into the minor leagues, perhaps the first step on his path to the major league level —  but the journey ahead figures to be a long and arduous one. The coronavirus outbreak earlier this year posed massive challenges for athletes, both at the collegiate and professional levels. Especially for players in the lower ranks of Major League Baseball, the cancellation of the minor league season in late June spelled disaster. Hundreds of players were released from their organizations, leaving their careers and livelihoods in limbo.
In spite of these turbulent months and the ones that are sure to follow, Suddleson has maintained his focus on what he has control over: his desire to play and the work he is willing to put in.
“I don't know what the long-term effects are, or how this affects people's paths going forward or whatever. But I do know that it's not ideal,” Suddleson said. “And the biggest thing for most of us is that we just want to play. So it was kind of hard to just not be able to really do that. You kind of had to find ways to, you know, get your work because those are reps that you can't get back.”
According to Suddleson, he was initially unable to find ways to throw or hit due to the closing of facilities and spaces in response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, once spaces began reopening, he was able to get into a regular throwing and hitting routine and kept himself in baseball form.
“At the beginning, there weren't a whole lot of places to go,” Suddleson said. “So it was just lift what you can, work out where you can, run where you can, throw if you can, hit if you can. It was that kind of stuff. But recently stuff’s started opening up a little bit more, so all that has been a little more accessible. For me personally, [over the summer] I was hitting and throwing pretty much every day, lifting pretty much every day. So it was very much getting ready as if I was going to play.”
One aspect of the unfortunately long offseason that Suddleson struggled with was not overdoing it with his training. According to Suddleson, the lack of in-game action made him feel like he was not doing enough, and he had to keep himself from overworking his body.
“Over the summer, it was just a little hard because that's a time everyone thought that they were gonna be playing,” Suddleson said. “So, at least for me, [it was] a little hard to turn off the hitting every day just because I feel like I already had so much time off, but I know that I really hadn’t.”
Despite itching for game action, Suddleson is not letting his frustration get the better of him. At a time when it is far too easy to look ahead with uncertainty and despair, he is locked in and focused on being fully prepared come next spring.
“All I know is that spring training is scheduled to start in the beginning of March and February, and I'm going to do everything I can to be as prepared as possible for that and ready to go when the time comes. I hope we can play a semi-normal season, but expectations? I don’t want to speculate.”
Suddleson will spend the rest of this offseason keeping in shape, though he will take it easy on the throwing and hitting to give his body a rest. Then, when the calendar flips and it is time for a (hopefully) full season of baseball, he will look to hit the ground running.
