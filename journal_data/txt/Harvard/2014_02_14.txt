After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Within its first few seconds, with pulsing beats merging with a metronome’s tapping, “Delorean Dynamite” sets itself up to be a different listening experience. Compared to most American dance and techno, the new single by Norwegian disco artist Todd Terje is refreshing. The inventive use of scales and well-placed strokes from a guitar gives the song a different flavor and makes it the perfect introduction to Terje and his new album, “It’s Album Time.” The middle section is upbeat but lags and gets caught up in a forgettable repetition—this is disappointing, especially for a song with such an electric beginning. Throughout this section, the single loses its unique feel and seems set to fade into obscurity. Towards the end, however, the track regains its initial momentum, this time through a mellow groove that takes the song to its finish. The controlled finale serves as a smooth transition from music to silence and proves what is evident from the first dropped beat: this song is not a random mix of sounds but a meticulous product of thought and experiment.
 
“Delorean Dynamite” is a techno track with inspired orchestration, even if it doesn’t seem distinct from other songs in the genre. Still, it carries a muted quality guaranteed to charm.
 
“It’s Album Time” is out on April 8 via Olsen Records in the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last week, House Speaker John Boehner effectively iced the yearlong, bipartisan immigrant reform effort when he announced that it the bill was unlikely to pass. The move comes amid loud opposition from right-wing activist groups like Heritage Action, which describes the bill as laying the groundwork for “mass amnesty.” The speaker’s genuflection to the activist base over a bill enjoying the support of Democrats, Republicans, the Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO is a tragic mistake that will unnecessarily worsen the lives of millions.
The plight of undocumented Americans has only worsened under President Obama. Deportations have only increased from the Bush era—almost two million have been deported during Obama’s presidency. The federal government spends more on immigration enforcement than the FBI, DEA, and Secret Service combined. Despite net-zero immigration from Mexico in the post-recession years, the Senate ponders a border surge that would put 19 border patrols per mile, construct a 700-mile fence, and employ drones, infrared cameras, and seismic sensors.
Closer to home, college-age students who are children of undocumented immigrants and did not come to this country of their own volition are placed precariously after the failure of the DREAM Act. They are not just numbers. They are our friends, our neighbors, and our classmates.
Harvard consistently admits undocumented students and endorses the DREAM Act. But that won’t be enough to effect change.
Given the self-evident necessity of reform of our dire immigration practices, it’s sad that Speaker Boehner will not pursue reform. The official reason given—that “The American people, including many of my members, don’t trust that the reform that we’re talking about will be implemented as intended to be”—is a weak attempt to blame the failure on the president rather than squeamish representatives.
But Boehner’s decision isn’t especially surprising. American stagnation on immigration comes amid immigration regression in Europe, where resurgent right-wing parties are pushing for quotas that threaten the very existence of the European Union. Strict limits on immigration to Switzerland were placed after a contentious referendum, and immigration restrictions are a key philosophy of the Greek semi-fascist Golden Dawn party and the Hungarian anti-Semitic Jobbik party.
Moral dilemma aside, the restriction of the free movement of people is antithetical to the free market ideology that many adherents of anti-immigration reform policies support. But the rising tide of xenophobia and nationalism, both here and abroad, seems to have overcome these considerations.
An estimated 11.7 million undocumented people live in the United States. It’s time to stop treating them like second-class citizens, for they too are Americans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I’m the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you gonna get. Don’t you open your mouth about the best or I’m gonna shut it for you real quick.”
Richard Sherman had just sent his Seattle Seahawks to the Super Bowl with an acrobatic pass deflection, capping off a hard-fought game against division rival the 49ers. Now the 25-year-old cornerback was ranting to ESPN sportscaster Erin Andrews, and these forty words were being broadcast live into the living rooms of over 55.9 million NFL fans.
Within minutes, the Twitterverse was set ablaze, each refresh of the Web page yielding a tweet more racially charged than the previous.
Before long, the cornerback found himself lucky to be called “just” a thug or a disgrace, as users gravitated toward increasingly bigoted language.
Even fellow athletes began to voice their opinions.
Basketball player Andre Iguodala tweeted, “[African Americans] just got set back 500 years…” and pitcher Justin Verlander claimed, “If [Sherman] played baseball he would get a high and tight fastball.”
Before long, however, Richard Sherman’s 3.9 GPA at Stanford became public knowledge, and immediately a new influx of tweets declared that Richard Sherman was no longer, in fact, the thug we had assumed he was.
The dilemma posed by this episode is not whether Sherman’s comments toward Michael Crabtree (the “sorry receiver they tried him with”) are unsportsmanlike or not. Frankly, that doesn’t merit attention. It’s not for the media—or anyone else—to settle a dispute among grown men. Crabtree is a professional athlete who makes a pinch under $5.4 million (compared to Sherman’s meager $510,000 salary) and will bounce back from these insults like he did his torn Achilles tendon earlier this year. Had the media not latched onto the incident, the world would have been engrossed in the Seahawks’ athletic prowess and their subsequently victorious trip to the Super Bowl, the post-game interview quickly fading beyond recollection. There would have been no public-relations-induced apology a few days later. The saga would have come to an end.
The real matter at play here is the mob mentality that Twitter can encourage. When managed properly, a Twitter account is an incredible resource. Several times a day, I find myself scrolling through the endless stream of content at my fingertips. But a low barrier to entry has its drawbacks. People upload tweets behind the thin veil of their various screens that, prior to the Internet, could never have been deemed appropriate. I’m not talking about the ever-irritating “#teamfollowback” or “#turndownforwhat” posts—certainly those could be viewed as intolerable as well. No. Most people innocently retweet and favorite pictures of adorable kittens and completely implausible Uberfacts, but some netizens are engaged in startlingly-ugly interactions.
Twitter’s privacy settings have lulled some users into a false sense of security, even as many people are beginning to realize too late that their digital footprint will never be washed away. Every single day, thousands of hateful and vulgar tweets are sent without a second thought, and I believe “trending topics” play a significant role in this phenomenon. If a member sees that a hashtag or phrase is in use by hundreds of people, the mental filtration system most of us possess malfunctions: “What’s one more tweet going to do?” The unruly crowd’s tendency to atomize the individual and absolve him of personal responsibility, so disastrous in the last century, reproduces itself on the Web.
The Internet is a potent force, and when its members collectively decide to target an individual, dire consequences follow. We’ve already seen social media help topple celebrities, not to mention regimes. Illinois Chancellor Phyllis Wise, subjected to her own Twitter persecution last month aptly commented, “I shudder to think what might happen if that type of vitriol were directed at a vulnerable member of our community.”

Quick show of hands: how many of you have an online dating profile, or have downloaded Tinder, Grindr, or some equivalent? My guess would be somewhere around seven or eight, mostly because the number of people reading this article probably doesn’t break a dozen. Nonetheless, many of us college students have downloaded apps, set up profiles, and otherwise gone fishing in the great river of bandwidth.
It all makes perfect sense. We’ve grown up with online profiles, turning to Facebook to find out who was at the party last weekend, which Game of Thrones character he got on that quiz, whether or not she’s single. Nobody can be too surprised to find out that so many of us duplicated our profiles or made the jump from Snapchat to Tinder, making our search for a fun night out just a little more explicit.
Unfortunately, though, despite the best intentions of site builders and graphic designers and urban planners, we have managed to bring the most vapid, photoshopped aspects of campus culture to online dating. One needs look no further than profile pictures. The Instagram filters and fancy sparkles make the profile picture look gorgeous, but there is simply no way she looks like Penelope Cruz in real life. And some of those tops are cut lower than the Mariana Trench. Someone really ought to let Victoria know; her secret’s hanging out.
The descriptive portion of profiles is no more helpful, particularly when they all start to blur together into something resembling this:
About me: I like hanging out with friends, going to concerts, and being outdoors. But if it’s been a long week, as in 5 days, I curl up on the couch watching movies and eating popcorn… yum!!!
The coolest place I’ve been: Probably Barcelona. I went backpacking once in Europe and it was aMAZing!!! I also visited London, and absolutely looove the accent.
What I’m looking for in a guy: What is his net present value? Is he funny? Will I try to imagine Seth Rogen when we make love?
Now I don’t mean to single out the ladies. The men’s profiles are no more interesting, and either implicitly or explicitly look a bit like:
What I’m looking for in a girl: What is her net present cup size? Is she funny? What is her net present cup size?
It’s unfortunate, but some of us have turned to other platforms on the internet to form long-lasting, intellectual friendships. I’ve started looking in the comments section of YouTube and Reddit.
Every once in a while, though, I spend time away from my computer, if only to see how people lived in the distant past. Last month, I went with a friend of mine to the local mall, because there really is nothing more interesting to do by the fifth week of winter break. Naturally, we walked by Victoria’s Secret, not to check out the models, but to get to the Ferrari store, and passed easily a dozen men standing awkwardly outside, pretending to be engrossed in their phone screens.
Now I sort of figured that these poor souls were waiting for girlfriends or sisters or, in one particular case, granddaughters, to finish shopping before returning to the normal world of Miami where women wear bikinis, not lingerie, on the streets. I couldn’t help but notice, though, that one of the fine gentlemen waiting was actually busy on Tinder, checking out all the eligible bachelorettes in a 15-mile radius.
Today is Valentine’s Day, and if I were a betting man I’d give you five to one odds that that particular individual does not have a date today.
But then again, neither do I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science hosted a free inaugural coding conference that drew more than 300 attendees from over 40 schools. The convention was sponsored by Google, Intuit, Facebook, and Microsoft, among others, and gave out thousands of dollars in scholarships. The event received coverage by Boston.com, VentureFizz, and the Harvard Gazette.
However, none of this information made it into the New York Times's coverage. The only detail that caught the reporter’s attention was an Instagram photo of the cosmetic mirrors Goldman Sachs gave away as swag. The title ran “Goldman Handed Out Cosmetic Mirrors and Nail Files at Women’s Coding Event.”
In its haste to lambast Goldman Sachs once again, the New York Times completely overlooked the company’s generosity and commitment to the noble goal of encouraging women in computer science. Goldman Sachs was the most generous sponsor for the event and also provided key chains and T-shirts.
The Times neglected to mention that Google offered lip balm and Facebook gave away copies of Sheryl Sandberg’s bestseller, “Lean In.” Instead, the Times conspicuously singled out Goldman Sachs. This selective coverage demonstrates the report’s priority to demonize Goldman Sachs over lauding the conference or even fairly reporting the news. The article is concerned less with what swag is being given out than who is giving it, much less why they are giving it.
Soon other publications ran similarly inflammatory headlines. Jezebel ran the sensationalist title, “Goldman Sachs Lures Women To Coding With Beauty Accessories.” Aside from merely being misleading, the title insultingly implies that women can be so easily manipulated as to be won over by beauty accessories.
This is not even to mention that nail files and mirrors are not necessarily gendered products. Perhaps this comes as a surprise to the editors of Jezebel, but males also possess fingernails and reflections.
The conference, entitled Women Engineers Code or WECode, (rather obviously) was never intended to be gender neutral. In fact, the sponsors were encouraged to provide swag that would appeal to the women attending.
A recurrent trend in these articles is to caricature some Goldman exec, leaning back in his chair, and thinking aloud between cigar puffs: “Well, we want our women to look good, so we’ll give ‘em makeup as swag.” All these caricatures suggest that swag must advocate something. Last I checked, Google does not offer potential employees key chains to suggest they own more keys.
In the hunt for click-bait articles, the Times would rather confirm the scorn of its readers for Goldman than publish a story that challenges those views. Honest reporting is merely a paperweight to keep articles from being completely untethered to reality. For the journalists of these publications, the Goldman Sachs brand is nothing but a buzzword synonymous with patriarchy.
Where it might have been reported that Goldman brought one of its female partners as a keynote speaker, these reporters chose instead to manufacture controversy over nail files. It defies all logic that the highest sponsor of a female coding conference is charged with sexist tactics for providing useful swag for women after being encouraged to do so by the female leadership of the conference. In fact, it practically defies the law of the conservation of energy that these headlines have managed to create a scandal where none was.
The screeching chorus of sensationalist newshounds and bottom-line editors drowned out the achievements of the women who attended the conference. The winning group at the conference’s hackathon designed an app to notify college students via text of free food or goods on campus. Second place went to a website called, “MommaCoder,” designed to encourage friendlier code assistance than the currently used site, “Stack Overflow.” Third place went to a Facebook application that automatically notifies selected friends of the user’s expected whereabouts and what they were wearing in case they didn’t return home safely within a specified time. Luckily for us, change is driven by bright young minds such as these and not the likes of those who choose how to report it.

“Oh, so you guys are Facebook official now! Now you know it’s legit.”
This is the sentiment I’ve heard dozens of times after I begrudgingly agreed last month to place my relationship status on Facebook. For some reason, my peers don’t accept a relationship as “legit” unless it’s immortalized in cyberspace—no amount of real-life emotional commitment can convince them otherwise. Gone are the days of “don’t trust everything you see on the Internet”—to my generation, it’s more like: “don’t trust anything until you see it on the Internet.” The Facebook Relationship Status is, unfortunately, a powerful thing—and people seem to use it for all the wrong reasons.
I was in the ninth grade. I met a fifteen-year-old theater nerd at drama camp, and I was convinced it was love. Even though we lived thirty minutes away from each other and neither of us could drive, we thought we were destined for each other.
Obviously, the first thing we did was immediately list our relationship on Facebook.
After months of enduring the heart-wrenching trials of a long distance relationship and hundreds of passionate pledges to go the distance, his sister dumped me on his behalf via text message. Heartbroken, I logged onto Facebook to write an angsty status about not being able to trust people. To my surprise, an event appeared at the top of my profile: Julia is no longer in a relationship. He had already broken our cyberspace bond, without even asking. People actually liked my modified relationship status. Maybe they liked my misery, maybe they liked the fact that I was again single. I hoped it was the latter. Devastated, I deleted my account…only to re-register the next week.
“It’s complicated,” “Married,” “In a domestic partnership.” None of these relationship statuses should be being used by people my age, and particularly not as a joke. Yeah, I know you think it’s cute to be common-law married to your BFF. But honestly, we all really know that by that, you mean: “In a relationship with Nutella while I drown my sorrows in Netflix binges.” And really, if your relationship status is that “complicated,” why are you posting it on Facebook? Maybe you just thrive on the drama.
Until Facebook makes it possible for me to be “in a domestic relationship” with “How I Met Your Mother” or “it’s complicated” with the Catholic Church, I’m sorry, but I’m gonna have to denounce the whole thing. Relationships should exist in real life, not on your Facebook timeline.
We now present to you the Class of 2017’s 15 Hottest Freshmen.
How hot are they? Our third degree burns will answer for us. One of our staff writers looked at them and now can’t see beauty in the everyday world. We can’t believe these freshmen exist. Enjoy, but don’t take it too seriously, as our 15 Hottest take you around Cambridge’s best date spots: Sandrine’s, Berryline, Sweet, Planet Records, Zoe’s, and Harvard Skate. Widener stacks didn’t make the cut.

In the face of growing constraints to revenue generated by its executive education and publishing programs, Harvard Business School will turn to alumni gifts and its endowment distribution to manage operating costs in the 2014 fiscal year, according to its 2013 annual report.
 
In the annual report, released online on Feb. 7, Chief Financial Officer Richard P. Melnick wrote that the Business School expects operating costs to rise with higher expenses associated with employee compensation, financial aid, expansion of executive education and publishing services, and the introduction of a new virtual learning platform, HBX.
 
While Harvard Business Publishing, which distributes faculty research, and the executive education program generated nearly 56 percent of the School's revenue in both fiscal years 2013 and 2012, according to the report, both branches face constraints from evolving pressures in the publishing industry and residential capacity for executives on campus respectively.
 
Consequentially, the Business School will seek substantial increases in revenue from Harvard’s endowment and current use gifts that are immediately available.
“Income from gifts given by HBS alumni and friends—including endowment and construction gifts together with current use giving—is central to the School's economic model,” Melnick wrote in the report. “Unrestricted current use gifts are particularly crucial as a source of flexible funding for the opportunistic investments that support innovation at HBS.”
 
The 2013 year-end value of the Business School’s endowment and current use funds was $2.9 billion, according to the report. Melnick wrote that the Business School’s endowment payout will grow by 2 percent in the 2014 fiscal year. Furthermore, as the result of an increase in income from donations, the Business School expects the actual revenue received from the endowment to increase by 2 percent from the 2013 fiscal year.
 
Additionally, the School has seen significant growth in its revenue from unrestricted current use giving, which increased from $19 million in the 2012 fiscal year to $22 million in the 2013 fiscal year. In an email to The Crimson, chief marketing and communications officer Brian E. Kenny wrote that these funds offer the Business School flexibility to address critical strategic resources and expenditures as it invests heavily in attracting new faculty and staff members, and in maintaining the competitiveness of its executive education and publishing programs.
 
“[Unrestricted funds] provide a much-needed and immediate impact on the School’s ability to advance key priorities, including financial aid, innovation in the curriculum, and nimbleness for research,” Kenny wrote, also citing the year-long FIELD course for first-year MBAs, the Harvard Innovation Lab, and the development of the online learning platform HBX as fund recipients.
 
In preparation for the shift towards a reliance on gift and endowment resources, the Business School dedicated significant resources in the 2013 fiscal year towards infrastructure for soliciting and facilitating gifts, including a rejuvenated alumni website. The goals of its capital campaign will be announced formally on April 20.

Harvard raised more than $792 million during fiscal year 2013, a 21 percent increase from its 2012 charitable contributions of $650 million and more than any other American university but Stanford, according to a survey released Wednesday by the Council for Aid to Education.
The total was largest the University has ever received in a single fiscal year, easily surpassing the previous record of $658 million raised in fiscal year 2001. According to the University’s FY 2013 annual financial report, Harvard raised $339 million in current use gifts—funds immediately available for application.
Still, the University trailed Stanford for the ninth consecutive year—Harvard has not been ranked the top institutional fundraiser since 2004. In recent years, Stanford benefited from a massive 5-year capital campaign that concluded at the end of 2011 and ultimately raised more than $6.2 billion.
Despite the conclusion of the “Stanford Challenge” and the launch of the public phases of Harvard’s own fundraising effort, “The Harvard Campaign,” in September 2013, Stanford still brought in more than $100 million more than Harvard in financial contributions.
Harvard’s $6.5 billion campaign goal is the largest in the history of higher education. The campaign had been in a quiet phase for about two years prior to the launch, silently raising more than $2 billion. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the School of Public Health, and the Radcliffe Institute launched their individual campaigns last October.
The Divinity School, School of Dental Medicine, and Business School will launch their unique campaign efforts in April, the Kennedy School in May, the Graduate School of Education in October, and the Medical School in November.
The Harvard Alumni Affairs and Development Office declined to comment for this story.
The survey also showed that American colleges and universities received a record high of $33.8 billion in donations in 2013. The council is an organization that has benchmarked fundraising in American colleges and universities since 1957, and the total fundraising amount for all institutions reflects the highest recorded monetary giving in the history of the survey.
These charitable contributions represent a 9 percent increase compared to last year and are a part of the ongoing recovery from the recent recession, which caused donations to fall more than $3 billion for a total of $27.85 billion in 2009.
In fact, alumni giving increased more than any other source of support, by 16.9 percent, and the average gift per contributing alumnus increased 18.1 percent. However, alumni participation declined to 8.7 percent overall.
The University of Southern California followed Harvard in the rankings, raising more than $674 million, and Columbia University stood as the fourth highest fundraiser at about $646.6 million. Out of the top four institutional fundraisers, Harvard was the only one to not receive a nine-figure gift. Columbia recently concluded a $6.1 billion campaign effort, which launched in 2006. USC’s ongoing campaign aims to raise $6 billion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, the only big loss to graduation the Harvard men’s basketball team sustained this year was that of Christian Webster ’13. But paper can’t tell you much about heart or passion. Paper won’t say anything about relentless noise-making and rabble-rousing. And that’s why, until now, paper never documented the departure of football player and student section leader Adam Riegel ’13.
To witness Riegel in front of a crowd at Lavietes Pavilion was to watch Rembrandt at his canvas. Riegel had an intimate feel for when to make noise (always) and how to make it (obnoxiously). Better yet, he convinced everyone else to get loud with him—and when they didn’t follow a chant, he maintained his composure and kept yelling. Riegel may have had an acute cotton allergy judging by the swiftness with which his shirt would come off, but this body was not on display for that cute Kappa girl in the third row. It was there so that you—yeah, YOU, UP THERE—would be inspired to get on your feet, cast aside all social norms, and stomp around like an ape for two hours.
At this year’s home games, the loss of Riegel has been glaring. Attendance remains high, but the noise level is not. Gone are Riegel staples like the call-and-response “Is that not the losing team?/Yes, that is the losing team” and “Boo that ref!/BOO!” Even the classic “I Believe” chant has been underwhelming, deployed with ham-fisted timing.
This past Saturday, against archrival Yale, with the entire football team in attendance, the moments of actual disruptive crowd noise were scarce. There may have been the odd “De-fense!” chant early in the game, and perhaps one or two more on key possessions late, but there was little sustained energy from the crowd. Obviously, no one is going to pin the night’s loss on the fans, but for the last few years, they were the ones who made Lavietes Pavilion an entirely unfriendly place for opponents to play. Have the Harvard faithful already become complacent with their success, now that they are no longer rooting on an up-and-comer? Or are they just searching for their Riegel?
I talked to Riegel earlier this week to get his take on his time at the front of the stands and on how he went about riling up students. Riegel described the rise of the student section as in parallel with the rise of the team itself; a few students who had close friendships on the basketball team began marshaling student support, creating Facebook events for games and leading cheers. As the wins mounted, so did the fan support, culminating in one of Riegel’s favorite moments as a fan, when the students damaged the stands at Lavietes during the Crimson’s defeat of Princeton on March 5, 2011, which earned the team a share of the Ivy title.
“Sometimes people aren’t going to follow you in the chants,” Riegel said. “Sometimes you’re just going to look like a fool, but that’s kind of part of the fun of it, too. You’re still there to have fun and watch the guys that you know, watch your classmates and help support them.”
Though cheering and shouting may be a natural extension of Riegel’s personality, there was also an element of strategy to his actions. By setting the bar high, he made the fans around him get more involved, as he did in absorbing the abuse of the Yale student section—again, in a shirtless performance—on the road at John J. Lee Amphitheater.
“If I’m going way over the top and way out there, and people see that, then it should make them more comfortable to do some of the basic stuff, just to be a little bit louder on their own,” Riegel said.
It may be that Riegel was a once-in-a-generation talent. It may be that, while Harvard was blessed with him for a crucial moment in the program’s development, his energy was never destined to be with us forever. But as the student section continues its search for his spiritual successor, his messages still contain essential truths for his erstwhile peers.
“Stand up, jump around, be loud, have a good time, be a little more boisterous than people expect Harvard kids to be,” Riegel said. “Maybe say some borderline aggressive things and see who follows behind you.”
PRINCETON V. BROWN
Games like these can give a guy mascot envy. Though both simple choices, there’s a lot you can do with fierce, intimidating creatures like tigers and bears. I hate to admit it, but the Princeton Tiger is a very well executed logo; the stern face and hooded eyes contain a great mix of danger and arrogance. The Brown Bear just looks vaguely stoned.
As much as we might talk ourselves into it, we’ll always be a little disappointed with “Crimson.” One of these days, I’ll get around to circulating a petition to get the name changed to a more powerful, respected representation of our institution: now introducing your Harvard Elephants!
Pick: PRINCETON
HARVARD V. COLUMBIA
The last time the Crimson visited New York City in conference play, it left thoroughly humbled by the Lions in a 78-63 defeat. Columbia is a good team now, doing good team things like making big threes and beating Princeton on the road. As we’ve mentioned before, this is new for those that follow the team, like the Columbia radio station WKCR, whose Twitter feed included analysis like “OMGOMGOMG” and “OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG” during the win over the Tigers. This will be a big test for Harvard coming off its first Ivy loss, but I expect them to narrowly pass it.
Pick: HARVARD
DARTMOUTH V. CORNELL
It’s the Chromo-Bowl! If you mix the Big Green and the Big Red, you end up with the Big Brown, a steaming pile of which this game is destined to be. Please don’t watch.
Pick: DARTMOUTH
PENN V. YALE
A tough weekend for the Bulldogs would force them back down into the ranks of the other Ivy pretenders who have briefly looked dangerous before fading away, like Princeton, Brown, and Columbia. The difference is that Yale actually succeeded in proving itself once in Saturday’s win at Lavietes and is now firmly in the conference race at the top of the league. I’m still skeptical the Bulldogs are for real, but I predict they will look like it for at least one more night.
Pick: YALE
PENN V. BROWN
In Friday’s game against Harvard, Brown’s Rafael Maia suffered a cut to the head on a drive and had to get a wrap around it to stop the bleeding. This turned Maia into the world’s largest, most intense rec league all-star (that's him on the bottom right). Beware, Quakers. Maia will body you, then sweat on you, then ask you when you’re free to grab a beer in the sauna.
Pick: BROWN
PRINCETON V. YALE
This is an interesting one. Both of these teams like to use size to their advantage; Yale doesn’t start a player shorter than 6’4”, and Princeton’s shortest starter is 6’3”, including the Ivy League’s most physically imposing point guard, 6’5” T.J. Bray. The Bulldogs’ size bothered Harvard last Saturday. A few times, they were able to isolate a larger player against the 6’0” Siyani Chambers in the post, which led more often than not to an easy bucket. They won’t have that same decisive edge against the Tigers, who I think are poised to give Yale its second Ivy loss.
Pick: PRINCETON
DARTMOUTH V. COLUMBIA
Dartmouth will be too busy looking at all the tall buildings to focus much on this one. Easy win for the Lions.
Pick: COLUMBIA
HARVARD V. CORNELL
Turn off your cell phones because there are no girlfriends allowed—Harvard is going to Ithaca. Yeah, there might be a game played at some point, but everyone knows that’s not what the Cornell trip is all about. Just look at these reviews of the city’s nightlife from local students: “Bars close at 1 a.m., so that sucks.” “I usually just hang out at my friends’ places on weekends.” “It’s cold in Ithaca, and I don’t have the patience to bear through the inclement weather to go out partying.” The Cornell trip makes The Wolf of Wall Street look like Daddy Day Care.
Pick: HARVARD

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before each season, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker and his staff place role cards above each player’s locker. The cards carry a few simple points of emphasis, defining the individual role a player must take on for the team to achieve success. The bullet points tell their own story, illustrating the team’s collective belief in a sum greater than its parts—a conviction in doing your job, not more and not less.
On a team as talented as Amaker has ever had, the cards are even more important. The Crimson, when healthy, goes two-deep at each position and there are more three-star recruits on the team’s bench than on the rest of the league’s starting rosters combined. Co-captain Brandyn Curry and senior Kyle Casey, All-Ivy League talents as juniors, have been forced to adopt new roles on a deeper team, playing fewer minutes and focusing on different areas.
“You have to do what is best for the team,” Casey said. “Maybe my freshman and sophomore year I had a bigger load in terms of attacking and looking for my shot, but I am focusing on what Coach wants us to do.”
Working within the system will be crucial for the Crimson (18-4, 5-1 Ivy) as it heads to the Empire State this weekend for its first pair of conference road games. Fresh off a 74-67 loss to Yale (11-11, 5-1) that snapped a 19-game home winning streak, Amaker stressed that the team must bounce back.
“I am expecting our guys to play better,” Amaker said. “Does that always translate into victory? No. But we didn’t play well this past weekend.... We have shown every time this season so far that after a loss—and fortunately, there haven’t been a lot—we have done what we always talk about, which is regrouping and responding.”
In a positive turn for the team, the coach said he expects junior Jonah Travis and sophomore Agunwa Okolie, both restricted for the past four games, to be at full health against Cornell (1-19, 0-6) and Columbia (14-9, 3-3), giving Amaker a ten-man rotation, extending the bench, and reducing starters’ minutes.
Minus the reserves, last weekend three players—sophomore Siyani Chambers, junior Wesley Saunders, and co-captain Laurent Rivard—logged at least 34 minutes a game. Amaker remarked afterwards that tired legs were a factor in the team’s 35-percent shooting over the two games, 10 percent under its season average.
“At this point in the year, it becomes a grind,” Amaker said. “Maybe our legs weren’t there initially [last weekend], but then it became contagious. We didn’t shoot well, and it cost us Saturday.”
On Friday, Harvard will be seeking revenge against the Lions after Columbia dealt the Crimson a 15-point loss the last time the Crimson went to New York. Little-used then-sophomore Steve Frankowski exploded for 27 points as the Lions shot 51 percent from the floor and put the game out of reach early in the second half.
“They beat us last year; our guys know that,” Amaker said. “We will see where we are this year. They are 3-3 in the league, and they have two games at home [where they could] put themselves in great position. We realize what is at stake.”
Going on the road also means antagonistic crowds in New York and Ithaca, which for Casey and Curry will mean jeers directed at the seniors’ leaves of absence in the wake of the Government 1310 cheating investigation last fall. Against Brown, a contingent of road fans began ‘cheater’ chants when Casey stepped to the free throw line—something the senior said he is ready for this weekend.
“Oh, it’s coming,” Casey said. “Essentially, it doesn’t affect me. I like playing in hostile environments and it’s a beautiful thing. I call it the Jeremy Lin effect because I have never seen it so perfectly executed—when someone steps into the gym and gets booed for whatever reason, and they walk out and you can damn near hear a pin drop.”
Casey’s card is simple: be the back line of the defense and be a monster competitor on the boards. As the team’s defensive anchor and vocal presence, Casey says it is critical that he and the team tune out both fans and the past and focus on what matters—the game.
“What happened, happened,” Casey said. “We accepted it and learned from it. Whether they are yelling my name or calling me a cheater or talking about the game, I gotta play my game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As drums, violins, and even a tuba courtesy of MIT band members added to the festivities of the annual Beanpot fencing tournament at the duPont Gymnasium, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams both cruised to their seventh straight titles on Wednesday.
The round robin event, which included area teams Brandeis, Boston College, and host MIT, saw the Crimson overwhelm its opposition throughout the evening.
“The women had a very strong outing, and we won this handily,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It was what we expected, and we had a really good chance this time to fence people who didn’t have a chance to fence during the year, with some of the walk-ons.”
MEN’S FENCING
Fresh off capturing an Ivy League championship over the weekend, the men’s squad picked up right where it left off by successfully defending its Beanpot title, which it has never lost. Harvard defeated the Eagles, Engineers, and Owls in succession to claim the right to hoist the pot again.
“I think today was good overall since we kept the Beanpot title, and that’s what we’re going for every year,” co-captain Michael Raynis said. “Even though some people may have thought they had spotty performances here and there, I think we came together and gave it our all to beat the other schools.”
The men’s side started the day strong with a 26-1 drubbing of the Eagles, with the sabre and épée squads going undefeated for the match. Across the board, the Harvard fencers controlled the strip and didn’t give their Boston College opponents many chances to initiate successful attacks.
Though the Crimson defeated the Engineers in the second round of the evening, the sabre and épée trios were inconsistent at times. The former earned a 7-2 win, but the latter lost in a tight, 5-4 decision. Ultimately, Harvard would still have enough points to capture the match, 20-7.
“Épée is unpredictable at times just by the nature of how it works,” Raynis said. “Some days we come together and edge out tough schools, and [other times] we dropped some bouts against schools that are not as competitive.”
Though the épée squad also dropped five bouts against Brandeis, the Crimson still came out on top thanks to the foil group’s 7-2 victory and rode to a 17-10 victory over the Owls.
“We had a good tournament, and the competition was good on the men’s side,” Brand said. “[This was seen] especially with Brandeis showing that they are building in the right direction because they gave us a good, hard battle.”
Three foil fencers posted undefeated records on the evening, with freshman Stephen Mageras and junior Brian Kaneshige both going 6-0 in their bouts. The sabre squad continued its recent dominance with a 22-5 overall mark.
“This is sort of the home stretch until NCAAs, and we want to put in our all just as we’ve done all season,” Raynis said. “I think we’re going to focus on cramming out as many bouts as we can into practice. I don’t see why we can’t have 12 really strong qualifiers heading into NCAAs in Ohio.”
WOMEN’S FENCING
Led by 26 total bout victories on the day from the foil squad, the women’s team had little trouble handling its three opponents en route to the Beanpot title.
“I think it’s really hard to prepare yourself to fence right after you have a huge competition like Ivies [last weekend],” co-captain Alexandra Kiefer said. “We were really emotionally drained after that…but we came back together and fenced really well.”
Boston College proved to be no match for Harvard, as both the foil and sabre trios swept their matchups. Kiefer mustered crisp attacks and well-timed counterattacks, and freshman sabre Adrienne Jarocki defeated her three opponents in less than a minute each.
“I think [we worked on] finishing our actions with confidence [today],” Kiefer said. “We had a chance to practice some actions we don’t normally do.”
The narrative was similar in the squad’s 20-7 and 22-5 triumphs over the Engineers and Brandeis, respectively. None of the individual weapons conceded a match, and the foilists combined for a 17-1 record against the final two teams.
“We had a really good recruiting class on the women’s foil side,” Brand said. “The two new fencers [Hali Nelson and Liana Yamin] are both seasoned fencers who have fenced both nationally and internationally. Along with Alexandra Kiefer, who’s obviously our big gun, they’re performing exactly what we expected them to.”
Kiefer and Nelson ended the three-match day with 9-0 records, and junior épéeist Emma Vaggo posted a  5-0 mark.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 6 ranked Harvard women’s hockey team boasts a 19-3-3 record and sits atop the ECAC leaderboard, but the players in Cambridge are not the only members of the team making noise.
Lyndsey Fry, Michelle Piccard and Josephine Pucci all made their Olympic debuts overseas in Sochi this week representing Team USA. Also joining them on the ice is Crimson alum Julie Chu, who recorded 284 points during her collegiate career, good for third all time on the Harvard scoring list. Furthermore, after leading the team to gold in last year’s World Championships, Crimson coach Katey Stone is handling the coaching duties once again in Sochi.
Team USA opened the preliminary round Saturday against Finland in a game that the Americans controlled from the start. Goals from Kelli Stack, Hilary Knight, and Alex Carpenter, three players with strong ties to the Boston area, lifted the USA to a 3-1 win. Carpenter currently plays for Boston College, Knight plays for the Boston Blades in the CWHL, and Stack has played for both of these teams. The Americans outshot Finland 43-15 in the victory.
On Monday, Harvard’s skaters made their presence felt in what turned out to be a one-sided affair. Outshooting Switzerland 53-10 over the course of the game, the USA cruised to a 9-0 victory. With less than six minutes remaining in the first period and the score already 3-0, Chu picked up her first point of the tournament on an assist to Knight. Late in the third period, Pucci also got in on the action, assisting Carpenter on the game’s final goal to earn her first career Olympic point.
After winning its first two games, the Americans secured a birth in Monday’s semifinal round, but one last game in pool play against Canada remained before the semifinal round would begin. The USA struck first late in the second period with a power play goal that Knight tipped past Canadian goaltender Charline Labonte. But Canada retaliated with three goals in the final frame en route to a 3-2 win. The Americans have not beaten Team Canada in the Olympics since 1998, but with a win in its next contest, the USA might earn another shot next Thursday with a gold medal on the line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tied at two in the fifth and final set, senior outside hitter Nick Madden hit a decisive kill to give the Harvard men’s volleyball team (3-3, 2-0 EIVA) its first lead since the second set. The Crimson never looked back, taking the fifth game, 15-12, and defeating Princeton (0-5, 0-1) at home in five sets for the second year in a row.
“It was a great volleyball match all around,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “It’s a great rivalry. I think even more so for me because it’s my alma mater and I have a bit of history there. I like to see [Princeton] competing the way they do, but I obviously like to see our guys come out on top. I knew one of the teams was going to come up with the big plays, and we were that team tonight.”
Madden paced the Crimson attack with 17 kills over five sets. Junior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick added to the offense with a .571 hitting percentage and 13 kills. Freshman outside hitter Casey White and junior outside hitter DJ White also had double-digit kills, contributing 11 and 10, respectively.
Although it trailed early in the first set, Harvard rebounded to take the game, 25-20, after seizing a 14-11 lead on three consecutive kills by Madden, White, and Zimmick. In the second game, the Crimson held onto a tight lead before opening up a four-point advantage off three decisive kills by Zimmick to take the set, 25-21.
“We were able to move me around and mix it up a lot,” Zimmick said. “It really worked well.”
After sprinting out to a two-set lead, Harvard fell behind early in the third game. Although the Crimson rallied back to tie it up, 10-10, the Tigers regained the momentum with two convincing kills from senior outside hitter Pat Schwagler. Harvard later pulled within reach, shrinking Princeton’s lead to one, but a string of errors helped the Tigers close out the set, 25-20.
“We weren’t blocking well,” Zimmick said. “We struggled with some passing here and there. And [Princeton] had a couple of good serving runs.”
The momentum shifted entirely to the Tigers in the fourth set, when Princeton gained a 15-10 edge before pulling away with seven unanswered points. The Tigers continued to pile on the pressure and eventually evened the match at two sets apiece with a 25-12 win.
Errors plagued the Crimson defense, with half of the team’s total errors in the match occurring in the fourth set alone. Princeton’s offense also came alive with 13 kills in just 18 attempts, with sophomore outside hitter Devin Stearns leading the attack with five kills in the fourth. Freshman middle blocker Junior Oboh also added two aces during the Tigers’ 7-0 run in the middle of the set.
“[Princeton] was playing great,” Baise said. “They hit .600 in the fourth set. It’s very hard to win when they are playing that well.”
Despite the Tigers’ ferocious comeback, Harvard managed to regroup after the fourth set.
“We talked about the kind of team we want to be and the kind of team we need to be if we are going to achieve the goals we set for ourselves,” Baise said. “We thought we could make a few defensive plays and put a little pressure on them.”
The Crimson ultimately emerged victorious because it elevated its game in the fifth set. The team posted its highest hitting percentage of the match, with nine kills in 16 attempts. After a kill by Young put Harvard within a point of victory, the match ended abruptly on a Princeton service error.
“At the beginning of the year, we know we have to beat Princeton,” Zimmick said. “The win sets us up well. We showed resiliency and came back and worked hard to pull it out at the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score tied at 73 and less than 20 seconds left in overtime, Columbia forward Alex Rosenberg gathered a pass at the top of the key. Staring down his defender, Harvard co-captain Laurent Rivard, Rosenberg watched the clock tick away, bleeding it out for the final possession.
The rest of the Lions cleared out to the left side of the floor, leaving him alone. Having watched Rosenberg torch a host of Crimson defenders for 32 points, Columbia coach Kyle Smith instructed Rosenberg to hold the ball and force Harvard to make a stop.
Rosenberg took two dribbles to the right and crossed over Rivard, lowering his shoulder en route to the basket. Drawing contact, he banked in a shot as the whistle blew.
Charge. Crimson ball. Two seconds later, double overtime.
In the second extra period, Rivard led the charge with four points as the Harvard men’s basketball team (20-4, 7-1 Ivy) pulled out an 88-84 victory over the Lions (15-10, 4-4).
“I thought [there were] an assortment of big plays…. But that was obviously a game-changing one right there,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We certainly made some big plays and [had] enough to come out with a victory.”
For most of the contest, a razor-thin margin separated the two teams. Columbia’s Maodo Lo and Rosenberg combined for 54 points on the night, hitting six of the Lions’ seven threes. After the Crimson took a 60-48 lead with six minutes to go, Rosenberg and Lo scored 14 points as part of an 18-4 Columbia run.
The spurt culminated in a layup by center Cory Osetkowski as the shot clock expired, putting the Lions up two with 75 seconds remaining. On the other end, sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers drew a foul and sunk two free throws to tie up the game. But once again, Rosenberg had the answer. Isolated on the right side, Rosenberg backed down wiry sophomore Agunwa Okolie and laid the ball in to give Columbia a two-point lead.
Harvard responded by handing the ball to its most consistent offensive weapon, junior Wesley Saunders. Saunders, who finished with 19 points on just eight shots, spun into the lane, but could not finish the drive. However, junior Steve Moundou-Missi tipped in the errant shot, and after a missed Lo jumper, the two teams headed to overtime.
“We felt that this was a critical game, [and] I think they felt the same way,” Amaker said. “I think it was evident by how both teams played, how hard both teams fought for this victory.… There’s a lot of basketball to be played but certainly for us, I think to be able to turn the page from last weekend after a Saturday night loss at home, I thought this was a critical game.”
For the evening, Moundou-Missi and Chambers anchored a dynamic inside-out attack for Harvard. The two tied for the team-lead in scoring with 22, pouring in 11 of the team’s 20 points after the end of regulation. In a one-minute span early in the first overtime, the pair drew the fourth and fifth fouls on Osetkowski, who finished with 10 points and four blocks.
“We’ve come to expect sensational efforts on the offensive end by some of our guys, but to see Steve play the way he played with a great deal of confidence—stepping up, making shots and getting on the glass—was the difference for us,” Amaker said.
Although it had 58 points in the final 30 minutes of play, Harvard struggled to score early. Fresh off a weekend where it shot 35 percent from the field as a team, the Crimson made only 42 percent of its shots in the opening period. Although the team’s top three scorers—Chambers, Saunders, and senior Kyle Casey—combined to make seven of 10 shots, Harvard’s bench made just one of eight attempts in the first half.
The starter-bench disparity continued throughout the game. With Casey in foul trouble, fouling out in just 12 minutes of play, co-captain Brandyn Curry and the four remaining starters all played 38 minutes or more. Overall, the bench had just seven points in 73 minutes as Amaker elected to stick to the same lineup down the stretch.
“We’ve known that we can go small at times if we need it,” Amaker said. “I just thought that lineup was what we needed tonight to see if we could somehow come up with a victory.”

Getting gifts for Valentine's Day has always been complicated (do you use debit or credit?) but the Hookup Culture has made the situation even more difficult. You shouldn’t buy anything that comes off as too clingy, but then again, you probably shouldn’t be buying anything at all.  Luckily, I am here with some helpful advice.
 
LeftoversNothing says, “I kind of care about you, but not that much that I want to make this an official thing” like a half eaten bag of any assorted candy. Make her Valentine’s Day with a half-empty bag of Dove chocolate bag or a handful of Sour Patch Kids (only the orange flavor). Make sure to emphasize that originally they were sent to you as a care package from your great aunt, and that your roommate already picked out all the good flavors.Pre-made ValentinesBuzzfeed came up with a list of handmade valentines. But Buzzfeed is stupid. I recommend going with pre-made cartoon valentines. The Scooby Doo valentine with the dog pun was a hit in second grade and it will be a hit now. Plus, Not only do you not have to write anything personal (unless you are indeed hooking up with your proctor’s Labrador—which is weird) but also they come in a pack of 16, which will allow you to cover most of your hookups since freshmen spring.An Odwalla BarOr anything else that you can buy with Board Plus. Get her a stick of gum, or better yet one of those waxy red apples that they sell in the Science Center Café, but that you could also have taken from a D-Hall for free. Caution: make sure that you don’t accidentally use Crimson Cash—that would make it a real gift.RespectIf you are worried about your half-eaten Odwalla bar or “yo” drunken Facebook message appearing too romantic on Valentine’s Day eve, tell your hookup that you are just looking to celebrate a different historic event. For example, on February 14, 1967 Aretha Franklin recorded her hit song “Respect.”  Also, in 1992 a cease-fire in Somalia began. I think we can all agree that that is something worth drunkenly hooking up over.A Goodwin Procter LLP PenNot only do they come in blue and black ink, but also if you swing by the OCS Pre-Law fair you also be able to get a 5-gigabyte flash drive. Give him one of these and, trust me, he will be the one texting you at 12:01am on February 15— when Aretha Franklin Day is over and it is safe to make contact again.

It’s 5 p.m. on Valentine’s Day, and you get a special text from that special someone—your boyfriend, girlfriend, friend with benefits, crush from section that you finally got up the courage to ask out. “Hey, so where are we going tonight?”
 
Crap. You were too excited about finally having a date on this usually tragic holiday that you forgot to actually plan the date. No worries—Flyby has your back. Here are some last-minute suggestions for Valentine’s Day spent in Harvard Square.1. Border CafeFor the hot and heavy. No reservation needed, though the wait may be a tad long if you go at peak dinner times. Still, the strung up lights always provide a fun, romantic atmosphere, and the fajitas are just as hot and spicy as your romance.2. Shake ShackFor the creative couple. This may not sound too romantic at first, but hear us out. You can get one shake (we recommend peanut butter) and put two straws in it. Then order some fries and split them “Lady and the Tramp” style.3. Crema CafeFor the romantic hipster. A couple of hot lattes to thaw the ice in your hearts, some pastries, and a cute, playful card (or maybe some poetry if you think you can pull it off) could make for a magical Valentine’s Day.4. L.A. Burdick’sFor the hopeless romantic. Because what Valentine’s Day is complete without chocolate, and is there a better place in Harvard Square for chocolate? You can split some and gaze into each other’s eyes in this European-inspired, old-fashioned café. Or Instagram your hot chocolate. Whatever gets you going more.5. Hong KongFor the most desperate. Nothing like dumplings with your dumpling. And depending on how late it is, you can split a Scorpion Bowl.6. CVSFor the more established couple. If you’re past the point where you need an exciting outing to make it a date, don’t force it. Get some food that you can “make” together. I don’t really know what says soul-mates more than splitting some Easy Mac and feeding each other heart-shaped Reese’s.7. Adam’s dhallFor the cheap and lazy.8. HillelFor the cheap, lazy, and Kosher.
