After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Usually actors are given specific roles by a director, but with this original work inspired by William Golding’s "Lord of the Flies," director Alistair A. Debling ’16 let the actors decide for themselves which characters fit their actions and dispositions. "Flies," which will open in the Loeb Ex on Dec. 5, is a new take on Golding’s novel and differs from the original text in its narrative form and character development.
"We began with creating movement, and then from there we created characters more or less based around the formation of ourselves in the script," actor Archie I. H. Stonehill ’17 says. "Then, from the characters we created the story."
Debling says that all of the actors worked with each other—first through improvisation and prompts from Debling and then through the development of certain scenes—to create their own script. The main characters are the same, and those familiar with the novel will recognize Piggy, Ralph, Jack, and Simon, as well as major plot points, but actors say that the script is more inspired by rather than based on the book.
Instead, the narrative flows between more standard scenes of two or more characters and monologues interrupted with repeated lines. Debling hopes that the structure of the play will allow the audience to become intellectually and emotionally involved with the characters to the point where the audience will begin to think of the Loeb Ex as perhaps something more than just black and empty—as an island where children attempt to govern themselves.

The best-known of Stephen Sondheim’s musicals are generally populated with bizarre and memorable characters; who could forget the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, lovers Maria and Tony in "West Side Story," or Sondheim’s tormented version of painter Georges Seurat in "Sunday in the Park with George"? But Sondheim’s "Company," which will go up in Farkas Hall on Dec. 5, depicts characters that are not so different from ourselves.
Music Director Ethan T. Addicott ’14 says he fell in love with the musical because of the relatable characters. The show, directed by Rose C. Bailey ’14, follows Robert, a single man surrounded by three girlfriends and five couples, as he tries to figure out what sort of relationship he wants to have. "There’s a couple for everyone," Addicott says. "Some people even relate to Bobby…. To any one person, it seems like everyone else is having better relationship success than they are."
"Throughout the show you see him interact with different couples, and he’s always the third one—the third wheel," says Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15, who plays Joanne, Bobby’s best friend. "There’s even a song in the second act called ‘Side by Side by Side,’ because that’s Robert’s life, just being the third person in all these relationships."
"It has one of the most modular structures of any musical theater piece that I’ve seen," says Daniel W. Erickson ’14, who plays Harry, a character in one of the five couples. Erickson says the show’s structure differs from other Sondheim musicals in that the narrative is told in a series of vignettes that do not necessarily progress chronologically.
The musical numbers, however, are reminiscent of the challenging and intricate melodies in Sondheim’s other shows, Addicott says.
"He does a lot of the Sondheim harmonically interesting chords, and the melodies are wonderful," Addicott says. "I think ‘Company’ has some of the best music of any of his shows."

1. Build a bow and arrow out of a clothes hanger.
 
2. Eat a lot of pita bread. (Get it?).
 
3. Rewatch the first “Hunger Games” and take a shot anytime someone dies (two shots if it’s especially gruesome. I’m looking at you, Rue).
 
4. Play a game of MASH with Finnick, Peeta, Gale, and Haymitch Abernathy as future husband options. Cross your fingers and hope for Haymitch.
 
5. There are twelve districts of Panem and twelve Harvard houses. Coincidence? Surely not. Find and move to House 13, an underground land of revolution. (Hint: it’s probably the Co-Op).
 
6. Lead a rebellion against President Faust. Prepare to fight against her “Peacekeepers” (HUPD).
 
7. Aggressively train like the tributes at the MAC for the Quarter Quell. If anyone asks why you are throwing a javelin in the elliptical room, explain that you can’t speak to anyone who’s not in your district.
 
8. Yell out “I volunteer as tribute!” as loud as possible during section when no one else is willing to talk about a reading.

Much has been made of the coming once-in-a-lifetime “Thanksgivukkah” convergence, an apotheosis of Jewish assimilation complete with vile turkey-and-latke creations for all. Last time it happened—1888, I’m told—Hanukkah wasn’t even much of a thing, and it won’t happen again until the year 79,811. This of course means that it won’t ever happen again, because for however much I love America and love Jews, I don’t expect either to exist on such a timescale (and if you do, I suggest that you get over it). So if it’s your sort of thing, enjoy it: it’s the only Thanksgivukkah there will ever be.
I will not deny that the convergence of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah serves my interests, narrowly speaking: That is to say, my mother will have no choice but to prepare a flavorful brisket instead of the ever-unpopular, but culturally perfunctory turkey. But beyond the alimentary upside, Thanksgivukkah does absolutely nothing for me. To put a finer point on it, this chimera of a holiday epitomizes much of what has always alienated me, a proud Jew and proud American, from the culture that is Jewish America. This season, I would rather celebrate the two concurrently than be dragged into the morass of cranberry sauce latkes, Hallmark bastardizations, and what I can’t help but imagine of Adam Sandler in pilgrim garb.
Thanksgiving, for whatever the Pilgrims and their Wampanoag neighbors actually did in 1621, has managed to grow from its colonial New England germ into one of America’s most splendid cultural institutions. It is ecumenical, ethically redeeming, civically healthy, and patently unconcerned with history. And if Christopher Hitchens and Jerry Falwell alike could celebrate it with gusto, it’s hard to imagine for whom this day of feel-good family feasting is beyond the pale. For me, the celebration of Thanksgiving is a sublime celebration of America-the-ideal, binding together all who eat turkey and give thanks as part of the openly fictive, essentially ethical kinship group that we call America. I very much like being part of this group, and Thanksgiving is a better expression of it than wearing yellow pants.
Now, I’ve no more patience than you, dear reader, for the turkey mobiles or the cringe-inducing attempts to conjure a singing holiday (a ditty I remember from my elementary school days: “Happy Thanksgiving, hooray, hooray, hooray! Aren’t you glad you’re not a turkey on this Thanksgiving Day?”) But it’s a reminder that to celebrate America is to grin and bear the tacky commercialism along with the Enlightenment goodness, even if it makes one want to chuck a pumpkin.
Hanukkah, which Christopher Hitchens hated, is an entirely different beast. At its core, it is an amoral celebration of national liberation, paid for in blood much dearer than turkeys’. Of course, if one is religious, the holiday (rather minor in religious terms) takes on some additional significance—I’ve heard of a miracle concerning some really slow-burning oil, molecularly altered by the classical Judeans’ concentrated faith, for instance.
But I am not so inclined, and I celebrate Hanukkah as I celebrate all Jewish things: a particularistic national festival (not that you’re not all invited!) of historical remembrance, meant to assert difference and independence, full of good, earnest song.
In short: the Maccabean rebels who kicked the Hellenistic Seleucids out of the Land of Israel were fanatical thugs, but they were my ancestors, and I owe my existence to them. Thus, latkes.
There is no meaningful way to square the circle. Thanksgiving is a holiday of ecumenical ideals, and Hanukkah a festival of bloody national liberation. In my book, the same goes for Americanism and Jewishness—two good things of entirely different kinds that are better left uncontaminated by each other. This is not to say that I didn’t enjoy “Portnoy’s Complaint.” But it’s about time that we end the charade, a favorite of liberal rabbis, of Jewish values as Enlightenment values, Judaism as post-ethnic ideology, and NFTY/USY/The Federation as a tenable substitute for Hebrew culture. In view of the American tradition of four centuries and the Jewish tradition of three millennia, attempts to create a new synthesis—the Pittsburgh platform, the half-hearted Sunday school, the country club synagogue, the oversexed youth group—appear extremely feeble and colorless. Thanksgivukkah promises no better.
Such an admission frees me to hike America’s national parks, bask in fantastic individualism, wear pastels, and enjoy Kennebunkport without worrying like the neurotic number-crunchers at the American Jewish Yearbook about assimilation and intermarriage. One never forgets that he is Jewish when it’s a matter of language, blood, a land he knows like the palm of his hand, and a forest of black chest hair that leaves no doubt as to its provenance. Prop-Judaism, which seeks its roots in Thanksgivukkah, bagels and lox, and sleepaway camp hook-up stories, is doomed to fall out of consciousness—no matter the great moral aspirations of its engineers. If it’s trivial and tacky, no one will care.
As a demonstration of this principle, I’ll be doing something quite radical next week: celebrating Thanksgiving and Hanukkah separately, as everyone always has. I expect to come out of the experience recharged—a more devout American and a more devout Jew. Just not much of an American Jew.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, Harvard students had the opportunity to vote for the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council for the upcoming year. Undergraduates had the opportunity to choose their favorite from three tickets—C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, Chika-Dike Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15, and Sam B. Clark ’15 and Gus Mayopoulos ’15. The first two options have been billed as “serious tickets,” with the third seen largely as a “joke.” I am not one to normally pay much attention to UC races, and I have no idea who my representatives are as a member of Eliot House. Yet, for once, I felt oddly compelled to pick a horse in this race—a matter particularly surprising to me, as I had always operated under the assumption that only friends of candidates ever had any reason to engage in UC elections.
This year I voted for (and even liked the Facebook page of!) Sam Clark and Gus Mayopoulos, and I found myself legitimately rooting for them as the results—and their victory—were announced last night. For the first time in my three years here, I have actually found one of the options for UC leadership to be genuinely “relatable”—despite the myriad individuals and tickets who make that claim each year. Perhaps driven by the fact that Clark and Mayopoulos are the only “UC outsiders” running—most Harvard students are not on the UC—these two candidates seem to somehow understand the relationship between the student body and the Undergraduate Council much better than the so-called “establishment tickets.” This is no better represented than in the following Clark/Mayopoulos response to a question in the annual IOP-sponsored UC debate: “It’s not just us who are confused about the UC, where the UC meets.” This may have been jocular in its nature but it rings true—to my knowledge, there is no UC building on campus. For all I know, they might very well hold their meetings in a dorm room; or maybe they are the only student organization to utilize the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Disconnect between Harvard students and the UC is further manifested in the various platforms and candidacy statements of those vying for the school’s top offices. Gong and Goffard’s main goal is to increase UC funding, as they appear to be under the impression that Harvard students want more UC—and not less—in their lives. I cannot be alone in believing the $75 UC tax (billed as a student fee) attached to our tuition bills is hefty enough as it is.  The Nwokike/Kim ticket placed emphasis on accountability and student voice, and they propose more student involvement in Undergraduate Council affairs. It seems unlikely that many non-UC members are lobbying for the ability to participate in this school’s “student government,” especially considering the number of races for UC representative earlier this semester that lacked interested candidates of any sort.
Sam and Gus, on the other hand, constructed their platform around tomato basil ravioli soup. While this was initially treated as pure humor, it quickly became clear that this was an issue that students actually care about much more than the bureaucratic pablum pitched by the other candidates as necessary solutions to the pressing issues facing this school. And—lo and behold—their idea actually came into being, as HUDS announced yesterday that the beloved soup will be offered every Thursday following Thanksgiving break.
I do not personally know any candidates in the race, and I cannot possibly comment on any of their motives for running for UC president or vice president. But it is easy to reflect on the stereotype that students who run for the UC want first and foremost to be able to write “president of the Harvard student body” on their résumé (I know I would!). I think it is clear that Clark and Mayopoulos made no such consideration when they decided to enter this race. As the Crimson noted, their ticket is considered as a “joke,” and it is unlikely that they jumped into the contest with the expectation of victory. Yet, in a recent interview, Clark maintained that, “we’re in it to win it.” And win it they did. Throuhgout the election, they expanded the conversation to include what non-UC members think about the school’s ostensible student government. Although Sam and Gus say they plan to step down from the positions they have earned, I am sincerely glad they won. Hopefully this can be a wake-up call to those who sit on the Undergraduate Council and fancy themselves as student representatives. Because students aren’t looking for more UC. All we really want is more soup.

I am writing in response to the recent Crimson editorial “No Racism on the T” favoring the suppression, as racially discriminatory, of a provocative subway ad funded by the American Freedom Defense Initiative that reads, “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel; defeat Jihad.”
America has had magnificent success in rising above the avaricious slave trade that marred its foundation. Overtly racist endeavors, such as the quest for the “Übermensch” that led to the extermination of millions of Jews during World War II, are now unreservedly condemned. Elite universities such as Harvard take pride in the racial diversity of their student bodies and train pupils to approach foreign cultures with the utmost respect.
Elsewhere in the world, such marks of tolerance are harder to come by. Iran’s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has publicly called for the destruction of Israel, while tens of thousands of demonstrators have been seen in Iran chanting, “Death to America!” Reports of Christians slaughtered for their faith in Syria and Egypt are now commonplace. And the history of the Palestinian territories is a long saga of two rival factions, Hamas and Fatah, seeking to wrest land both peacefully and violently from one another and the state of Israel.
In its now famous ad, the AFDI does not attack any person on the basis of ethnic heritage (this would be racism in the usual sense), national origin, or even religious faith. Instead, it takes aim at jihad—the peculiar brand of violent action on the part of certain deranged individuals and organizations, purposed toward the forcible spread of radical Islam, and directed most especially toward the United States and Israel, an all too familiar phenomenon since 9/11.
This being a university of diverse political views, some readers will inevitably take issue with my language, my logic, and even my facts. Respectful dissent is welcomed; indeed, it is through it, and not through accusations of racism, that we show the civilized nature that we as Americans and Harvard students have.

Today in my hometown of Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings will lead a solemn and dignified commemoration of the life of John F. Kennedy. David McCullough will be the only other speaker. It is the first official ceremony the City of Dallas has held on November 22 in the half century since the former President's tragic death at Dealey Plaza. And it is welcome.
I know something about all this. My great-grandfather was G.B. Dealey, who was honored by the City of Dallas in 1935 by the naming of Dealey Plaza—recognizing his civic leadership over the course of the 50 years since he established “The Dallas Morning News.” Dealey had put the company in financial peril in the early 1920s by taking on the Ku Klux Klan and inciting an advertiser boycott that lasted nearly three years. By all accounts, he was one of the most distinguished newspaper publishers in America.
It is profoundly ironic that the most dynamic president of the twentieth century was killed in a place celebrating the accomplishments of a man who personified civic virtue. And that one of G.B. Dealey's sons, Ted, would steer the News far to the political right on its editorial page, stoking the emotions of a coterie of arch conservatives in our city. This kind of edge was hardly unique, however, and remains present today in the United States and all parts of the world, often manifested in Internet vitriol.
The behavior of this minority in 1963 stamped the perception of Dallas for decades, even though reality was otherwise. Yes, our city bears responsibility for tolerating political extremism in the early 1960s, and we've coped with the deepest form of regret and ambivalence for five decades. But Dallas has become a city of great diversity and in many ways is emblematic of our country's future.
History is a complex of high-mindedness, sinister intent, happenchance, and circumstance. Lee Harvey Oswald, an avowed Marxist, surely did not come to Dallas because of right-wing politics. But his actions on November 22, 1963, changed America's course and left Dallas grasping for answers. Since then, the city's leaders have found ways to educate our citizens and visitors from around the world about the events of that day, and we've invested emotional energy, time, and resources to build a community that strives to meet President Kennedy's admonishment to ask what we can do for our country. Of that, we can be and are proud.

The newly renamed Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center has the potential to be an exciting part of campus life when the renovated building opens in 2018. For now, it remains a cement monstrosity—an uninviting, poorly designed, and aging reminder of the 1970s. The Harvard and Cambridge communities might be better served if the renovations began with a wrecking ball and whole-scale demolition, but we accept that most of the building will remain intact as a sad reminder of the architectural sins of our past. Even so, there is a lot that can be done to make this space better serve the Harvard community.
The renovated campus center should strive to be a flexible, inviting space. It should be a spot that students naturally gravitate toward. That will depend on the availability of good food options, comfortable seating, and the feeling that the architects create. We hope that there will be ample event space as well as rooms that student groups can book.
The University should be applauded for including student input in the design process. Over the next several weeks, the planners will hold a number of focus groups with people across the Harvard community. The success of the building will hinge on how responsive the designs are to student suggestions. This new space simply will not work if it feels sterile or separated from the rest of Harvard. If it feels like the SOCH, it will be a failure.
Since the announcement, some students have argued that the space will not actually achieve its goal of fostering a united university. The naysayers are skeptical that the campus center will ever become a common space. Distance makes it unlikely that the campus center will be a hotspot for Medical School or even Law School students, but the Common Spaces initiative should not be underestimated. Just a few years ago, there were no chairs in Harvard Yard. Now it is hard to imagine the Yard without them. Only last year, the Science Center Plaza was a construction zone. Now it is a vibrant platform for food trucks and events. If past projects are any indication, the Smith Campus Center will be a success.
The bad news is that few current students will be at Harvard long enough to benefit from the renovated Smith Center. Current students will hear about the great things to come but leave before they have the chance to experience them. For students who will be gone by 2018, they will only ever know the Smith Center as the concrete shame that it is.

Fifty years ago, millions of Americans first heard the news that John F. Kennedy ’40 had been assassinated from CBS’s Walter Cronkite.
Interrupting the soap opera “As the World Turns,” Cronkite’s announcement of the president’s death has since become iconic. A grainy video recording of the newsflash can now be seen on YouTube: “President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time,” Cronkite states, visibly emotional, as he slowly removes his black horn-rim glasses.
Douglas H. Shafner, currently a security officer at Harvard, witnessed the events of November 22, 1963 from a closer vantage point: the master control room of Cronkite’s CBS.
These days, Douglas H. Shafner’s 50-year career in radio, television, and advertising (as well as a short stint driving a Boston tour trolley) is behind him. As a security officer, he is responsible for keeping the buildings up and running at Harvard’s Museum of Natural History and the Soldiers Field Park residences at the Business School: monitoring entrances and exits, and shutting down operations at night.
White-haired and wiry, a Harvard baseball cap casting a shadow over his vivid blue eyes, Shafner takes a break from his post at 60 Oxford Street to recall the day he hasn’t stopped thinking about since 1963.
Shafner describes himself as a moderate Republican more than anything else, but says he was drawn to Kennedy as he hadn’t been to any other politician, before or since. Shafner’s speech grows forceful as he says Kennedy was a pragmatist: “absolutely practical in his solutions to things.”
After Kennedy’s election, Shafner began to read The New York Times religiously. In the 1960s, the Times still published the full text of any presidential speech or press conference; Shafner would read every word. He was astounded by Kennedy’s poise in fielding questions from reporters at his press conferences: “He handed it all with charm and depth.”
On November 22, 1963, Shafner began the morning in the room across the hall from master control at CBS’s operations center, then at Grand Central. Long interested in media—as a teenager growing up in Boston, he was a disc jockey in the heady early days of rock ’n’ roll—he had recently taken a job in the television programming department of a New York advertising agency called Benton & Bowles.
This particular Friday morning, Shafner was responsible for pre-screening an episode of a program entitled “East Side, West Side,” to ensure that there was no conflict between programming and advertising. A technical director from CBS was among the group gathered that morning to watch.
“All of a sudden, the film stops,” says Shafner. The technical director telephoned someone downstairs, Shafner remembers: “And they say, ‘The president has been shot. Come downstairs immediately.’”
Everyone in the room thought it was a joke. “Yeah, he’s telling me the president’s just been shot,” the director said skeptically, Shafner recalls. But when the screening did not begin again, he got a return phone call. If the group didn’t come downstairs immediately, the voice said, the director would lose his job.
Even today, Shafner’s eyes widen and his breath shortens as he recalls that moment of recognition: “Like an arrowshot into my heart,” he says. Dazed and unbelieving, he hurried across the hall to the master control room. This was the final dispatch point, collecting every program and every source—from every studio, every city—before compositing it together and sending it out to television screens around the country.
There he was met by a hectic crowd of programmers, technicians, and other employees all yelling at each other across the room. Within the commotion, a single, still scene: A lead technician, listening intently on his earphones, turns to a production assistant and tells him to find a telop—an insertable slide—at half mast.
“I couldn’t believe it,” Shafner keeps repeating, shaking his head, his hands gripping the swivel chair in a quiet lobby of the Oxford Street IT offices—a sharp contrast from the frantic activity of that decades-ago day.
No one knew for sure whether the president had died or not until a few minutes later. At once, Walter Cronkite, himself down the hall, flickered onto all the televisions in the master control room. “He made the famous announcement: ‘The president has died.’ He took his black horn-rim glasses off,” Shafner remembers, his own voice catching as he speaks, “and tried to brush a tear away.”
But the day was far from over: The next planned programming was the Phil Silver Show, a political comedy that Shafner knew would be far from appropriate for the circumstances. He left the confusion-laden control room, where no one was certain for how long breaking news would remain. Someone screamed, “We’re staying live with news!” as he hurried out the door.
With no cell phone to alert his boss, Shafner had to make the 15-minute trip to the agency on foot. “People were walking around just in shock,” Shafner says. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Nothing like it—this is New York—people in a daze.”
Out of breath, he rushed into the office where several senior vice presidents were gathered around a table. “We’ve got to get out of this—“ he began, to which they replied, “It’s ok—they’ve suspended all programming.”
Another associate, Dick Kirschner, accompanied Shafner back to Grand Central, where they would be responsible for taking any further advertising off the air. They stopped at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where both knelt to say a prayer. Shafner had to show Kirschner, who was Jewish, how: “He said very quietly, ‘What do I do next?’”
As soon as they arrived at the studio, they were told that the news would be broadcasting live and commercial-free for the rest of the day.
Kirschner went home to Brooklyn, while Shafner stopped in at one of the Irish bars across the street. “There wasn’t a lot of conversation,” he says. “People were just drinking,” and watching the screen.
By the time he emerged onto Lexington Avenue, the first afternoon newspapers were ringing the streets, their headlines blaring. The New York Times’ late city edition read: “KENNEDY IS KILLED BY SNIPER AS HE RIDES IN CAR IN DALLAS; JOHNSON SWORN IN ON PLANE.”“
I was born in 1942,” says Shafner, leaning back as he finishes his story. “There’s been major events and assassinations: John Lennon and Martin Luther King—nothing, nothing like this.”
“I felt like the American public was so tied to the hope that he represented,” he adds.The legacy of Kennedy’s shortened presidency has been debated lately, in the press and in classrooms throughout the country. But 50 years later, Shafner hasn’t wavered from his belief that Kennedy’s message was important, and unique.
“Those who weren’t there try to say that he was all surface or style,” says Shafner, his eyes flickering slightly. “He was substance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As is often true of the Friday before Harvard-Yale—especially when The Game is in New Haven—Nov. 22, 1963, was as much a getaway day at Harvard as anything else.
“[T]here was a high buoyant feeling for life in general,” John Donnelly, Jr. ’64 said. “The Game had a strong following—there was a lot of spirit in those days.”


At the offices of The Crimson, Managing Editor Bruce L. Paisner ’64 was meeting with his lieutenants to brainstorm stories for the Harvard-Yale edition of the paper, one of the most read editions of the year.
“It was a very slow news day,” Paisner remembered of that Friday. “We were sitting there thinking ,‘What are we going to put in this paper?’ [We were] trying to think of a worthy story for The Game.”
But for Paisner, the idea that Nov. 22 would be a “slow” day of news, or that The Game would dominate weekend headlines, were a shattered by a knock on the door of The Crimson.
“Somebody came running in off the street and said, ‘Have you heard that the President’s been shot?’” Paisner recalled. “Well, actually we hadn’t.”
With scraps of information compiled from Associated Press reports and Walter Cronkite’s CBS News broadcast, Paisner and his editors pieced together a story. The headline, like many that day, was simple: “KENNEDY ASSASSINATED.”
A PERSONAL CONNECTION
The news of the president’s death was a crushing blow to a campus that felt a unique kinship with the young leader.


“The relationship between the Kennedy administration and Harvard was very special because there were so many connections between Harvard and the administration that sometimes it seemed that the White House was an extension of the Yard,” Joseph M. Russin ’64, a former Crimson editor, remembered.
Paisner recalled that many students and professors thought of Kennedy as a Harvard alumnus first and a president second. The Crimson, he added, occasionally identified him on first reference as “John F. Kennedy ’40, President of the United States.”
Even after his ascent to the White House, Kennedy maintained strong Harvard ties, summoning numerous Harvard faculty to Washington serve as presidential advisors. He also continued to serve on the University’s Board of Overseers.
Many students remember seeing him walk through Harvard Yard on his way to and from meetings, and, just four weeks before his death, Kennedy appeared in Harvard Stadium, where he watched Harvard tie Columbia on October 19, 1963.
 
When he wasn’t in Cambridge, Kennedy stayed abreast of Harvard events, either by reading The Crimson—which he had delivered to the White House—or by listening to a Harvard football game on the radio.
“Occasionally, you might get a note from the White House saying, ‘The president liked your story. The president liked this or that,’” Russin remembered.
‘HE WAS OUR LEADER’
As details of the tragedy in Dallas reached New England, many Harvard students were already on the road. Those that had their radios turned on heard the news first.
“[W]e were somewhere in New Haven when another car of glee clubbers pulled up next to us, rolled up the window, and said ‘Turn up the radio!’” remembered Daniel B. Curll ’64, a member of the Harvard Glee Club who was carpooling to Yale with the Radcliffe Choral Society for their annual Harvard-Yale concert.


“That was the first we heard,” Curll said.
Back in Cambridge, reports in The Crimson detailed empty restaurants, people gathered around transistor radios and in cars listening to the news, and a female student breaking out in tears in Widener Library. People clustered around the Harvard Square newsstand, waiting for the national papers to deliver extra editions of the day’s record.
“Even today it seems surreal. You were sitting there writing these things [about the assassination], and you’re writing them and not believing them,” Paisner, who led The Crimson’s coverage of the assassination, remembered.
By dusk, even the best-laid weekend plans—The Game in New Haven and associated concerts, gatherings, and other Harvard-Yale events—had either been called off or postponed. The University also cancelled classes scheduled for Saturday and Monday, and even pushed back some exams.
The changes were fitting—a cloud of shock and sadness had descended over the campus.
“You could feel it all over Cambridge,” recalled Jonathan D. Trobe ’64, a former Crimson editor. “There was disbelief. It didn’t seem possible. Kennedy had a certain quality. You didn’t think that this could happen to a person like him.”
In lieu of classes, memorial services at Memorial Church and around the Boston metro area were scheduled almost daily for the next week.
“People were depressed, and felt like life was over,” Trobe said. “He was our leader.”
REMEMBERING JFK
The Harvard Glee Club and Radcliffe Choral Society had long been booked to perform at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on Sunday Nov. 24, 1963.
But, after the president’s assassination, the concert acquired a new significance almost overnight.
As the two choirs, accompanied by the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, got back on the highway and headed to Washington, mourners were beginning to flock to the president’s casket on display in the Capitol Rotunda.
“It quickly became a concert dedicated to the president,” remembered Curll.
As the Harvard performers tried to place their emotions aside—a task Curll admitted was difficult—producers from the nation’s major broadcast outlets jumped on the president’s connection to Harvard. As the networks showed images of mourners around Kennedy’s casket, some mixed in audio from the Harvard concert to replace the silence.
The Glee Club, the RCS, and the HRO were not the only groups that had to carry on shortly after the tragedy. The Harvard football team, back in Cambridge, spent another week practicing for the Bulldogs. But when The Game was played on Nov. 30, Yale came out charging and upset the heavily-favored Crimson 20-6.
“We were a little flat,” quarterback Michael H. Bassett ’64 remembered.
But The Game—and the anticipation leading up to it—was an afterthought, largely devoid of the usual anticipation. Trope remembered the scene at the Yale Bowl that Saturday as “like a tomb.”
Meanwhile, students and administrators in Cambridge were at work deciding how to honor the fallen president. At the time, various ideas were floated around, including building Kennedy’s presidential library next to the Harvard Business School—a plan eventually derailed by legal troubles and objections from the City of Cambridge—and naming what would eventually be called Mather House in honor of Kennedy.
Still, it did not take Harvard long to recognize its tragic alumnus. In 1966, the Graduate School for Public Administration was renamed the John F. Kennedy School of Government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
In living rooms and on front porches across the nation, from Harvard Yard to Dallas, groups formed around televisions and radios to hear the impossible. Elsewhere, citizens young and old were moved to tears, privately mourning a public loss.
The assassination of President John F. Kennedy ’40 on November 22, 1963, holds a unique claim on the American psyche. It was perhaps one of the first and most powerful instances of the live news media shaping the national experience. And yet, to those who experienced it, Kennedy’s death was also intensely personal in a way few events in American history have been.
Fifty years later, those personal memories are what remain. The Crimson has asked a broad range of alumni, many of whom are still a part of the Harvard community, to reflect on the moment they heard of the President’s death. A smaller number of experts around Harvard have offered an assessment of Kennedy’s legacy in American culture and political history.
A number of those remembrances are printed here.
***
The day President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, I remember walking down Dunster Street around noon toward Eliot House, where I was a tutor in English. I was going to the Senior Common Room before heading to lunch in the dining hall. I remember seeing two young men throwing a frisbee and one shouted something about the president being shot. They nonchalantly continued throwing the frisbee.
When I got to Eliot House, the news that the President had been shot was confirmed and we headed down to a basement recreation room to watch a TV set with Walter Cronkite announcing in solemn tones that the President had been shot. Soon his death was reported, and we all were in a state of shock and disbelief that this had happened. After all, President Kennedy was a Harvard man and, in the words of Joseph Conrad, he was "one of us."
The following days were a period of uncertainty and mourning for the Harvard community.

November 22, 1963, was a warm, late fall Indian summer day. My fiancé, John Clark ’64, and I were walking around Harvard Square in the early afternoon after lunch. It was the day after my 21st birthday and my parents were going to meet us later for a performance of "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" by Bertolt Brecht at the Loeb Theater in the evening.
We were walking on Mass. Ave. just along the Yard. At some point we became aware of a kind of quiet and then heard radios through open windows from the freshman dorms. I think we heard the news of Kennedy being shot that way.
We never did see the play. I think we took the train to my parents house in Canton and then spent the weekend glued to the TV, which belonged to my grandparents who were living with us....
We were stunned. Just stunned. After we graduated we joined the Peace Corps, which of course was Kennedy’s idea, and went to Turkey. The Peace Corps was then headed by Sargent Shriver, Kennedy's brother-in-law.
Colleen Gaines Clark ’64 was a Radcliffe senior when the president was assassinated.

I remember crossing from the MBTA island [in Harvard Square] to the corner of Mass. Ave. and Boylston. A young woman crossing the other way was openly sobbing. I wondered what that was about. I went to my room in Kirkland, and as I was turning on the radio, I heard someone in the courtyard say “Kennedy has been shot.”
As the radio came on, “the President is dead” boomed out. For some reason I went up to the Yard and stood there as people listened to transistor radios. The sky was bright blue, but somehow it seemed black.
John Clark ’64, Colleen Gaines Clark’s husband, was a senior at the College in the fall of 1963.

At half-time in the middle of the afternoon of November 22, 1963, in New Haven our soccer game against Yale was deadlocked at 1-to-1. In those days this always took place on the Friday afternoon before The Game. Our team was in a huddle just before taking the field when our captain, my roommate Lou Williams, brought the dreadful news from the sidelines: “President Kennedy has been shot. He's dying.” So engrossed in the game were both teams as well as our coaches and any "officialdom" that may have been in attendance that the shock failed to distract us, and we finished the game.
Today, I have a glossy framed newspaper photograph in my study. Four people are frozen in time. My teammate Chris Ohiri (dead of cancer two years later and in whose memory Ohiri Field now hosts Harvard's home soccer games), his profile a picture of rapture, has just kicked the winning goal. I am next to Chris, back to the camera doing nothing very useful. Ditto the Yale goalie. The entire dramatic value in the picture is produced by the ashen, distant stare on the face of the single remaining spectator standing directly behind the Yale goal, alone in his misery and utterly oblivious to what was going on in front of him. One of the Yale substitutes was John Kerry. Michael Crichton was the soccer-reporting Crimson scribe.
John Thorndike ’64, was a senior in the Fall of 1963. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1968.

What I recall is that [Managing Editor Bruce Paisner] and I and others were in the newsroom in early afternoon when the first calls came in, from students on campus who'd heard the news on the radio and wanted us to confirm. Within a half hour we'd rented a TV and set it up in the newsroom; remember, this was before TVs were ubiquitous and decades before the Internet, so we were depending on the TV networks and our clanky AP teletype machine, our one link to the world of (almost) real-time news. Bruce quickly handed out the assignments; mine, as Associate Managing Editor was to man the desk, edit copy and make sure everything was as concise and accurate as the immense time pressure and the many gaps in information allowed.
Beyond the obvious Harvard connection of a U.S. President who was an alumnus and an Overseer and who had brought many Cambridge luminaries (Bundy, Galbraith, Schlesinger and others) to the White House, there was the immediate matter of The Game, scheduled for the next day, Saturday.... I believe some of the Harvard House-Yale College football games were already in progress when the news was confirmed; some or all may have been cancelled mid game. Within hours The Game itself was cancelled.
Without the task at hand, of reporting, editing, and putting out the Extra, many of us would have dissolved into tears but we kept it together because this was by far the most important story we would ever handle on The Crimson, and one of the most important The Crimson has covered in its long history. No one alive that day will ever forget it, and especially not those of us on The Crimson who had the special responsibility of recording history.

As I was walking back to Leverett House from having a haircut and passing through Harvard Yard, the Yard was strangely quiet—only the tolling of the Memorial Church bell; not ringing, but slowly tolling. There were quiet gatherings in the entryways to a number of the buildings. I approached one to ask what was going on, and was told that the President had been shot. We went from the fall of our freshman year, when Jack Kennedy was elected, to the fall of our senior year when he was taken from us. Some of our classmates joined the Peace Corps; some went to Vietnam; many went on graduate school. But none of us forgot that awful moment.
Thomas Brome ’64 was a senior in the fall of 1963.

Like so many other Americans, I do remember where I was on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. I was in the dining room of Eliot House (where I was a tutor) near the second window on the left as you enter. Somebody heard the news that he was shot on a transistor radio, and our group sat stunned at the enormity of the crime. Our first thought was dismay that his successor would be Lyndon Johnson—a man who turned out to be an abler President and a more effective liberal than Kennedy.
President Kennedy’s assassin was at first thought to be a right-wing bigot, but Lee Harvey Oswald was in fact a self-described Marxist and an admirer of the Cuban Communist tyrant, Fidel Castro. This was difficult for most liberals—and thus most of Harvard—to accept because Dallas had indeed been a center of right-wing bigotry. Still today much of the country believes there is something sinister about Dallas and that Kennedy was the victim of conspiracy, despite overwhelming evidence that Oswald by himself was the killer. It is disturbing to think that a man so highly placed and so attractive as Kennedy could be so vulnerable as to be brought down by a sample of the dregs of humanity. Aside from the attitude of liberals, our democratic spirit shudders to think that the people in which we take pride could contain an Oswald.
Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, a government professor at Harvard, was a lecturer at Harvard in the fall of 1963.

I will never forget the moment I learned of the tragedy in Dallas. I was coming out of a French class in Boylston Hall and everyone was huddled around a radio on the steps when someone said: “The President has been shot.” Students and teachers were in tears; some retreated to quieter places; others stared into the afternoon sky in disbelief.
It was such a hopeful time. The President had spoken to a crowd in front of the Berlin Wall in June claiming “Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, no man is free” and, in the same month, had championed the cause of civil rights at home, stating that “every American should enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color.” Our leadership was young, visionary, resolute, and inspiring. And, suddenly, we were threatened by an unknown assailant and the uncertainty that the progress we’d counted on as a country and as a globe we would ever get to see.
The Harvard-Yale game the next day was postponed—a fitting response to the tragedy and the beginning of a period of mourning on the campus, the likes of which we would not see again until that fateful day in September, 2001.
Thomas A. Dingman ’67, the Dean of Freshmen, was a himself freshman at the College when the President was assassinated.

Most if not all 1964 classmates recall exactly where they were when they heard that Kennedy had been shot. We were the only class whose Harvard years began before the 1960 election, and ended the year after Kennedy was assassinated. And we were certainly a class full of members inspired by his words and expressed idealism (and, to be sure, affected on the negative side by his expansion of the war in Vietnam).
I had an 8-inch vertical screen TV (cathode ray tube of course, with vacuum tubes), housed in a big wooden box that took up half my desk, and all of Kirkland House Annex D-entry was glued to that TV for the rest of the day. Others sought TVs wherever they could be found.

In an age of hyper-partisanship, John F. Kennedy’s legacy continues to inspire not just Democrats and those on the left, but also those on the right. Witness the recent book by my classmate and former Crimson president Ira Stoll ’94, “JFK, Conservative” Despite being born almost ten years after his death, he certainly inspired me.
While growing up, my two favorite Presidents were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.  JFK was young and cool, and his wife was elegant. He was a war hero, a big believer in our country and an inspirational speaker who challenged Americans to act upon our dreams.
As an incoming Harvard freshman, I became ecstatic upon being assigned to Weld Hall, the President’s freshman dorm. My roommates and I called our room “The Kennedy Suite” and covered its walls with JFK posters purchased at the Coop.
Twenty years later, I am now at the helm of the IOP, a living memorial to President Kennedy, where for almost fifty years, we have celebrated the President’s legacy every day. Watch the IOP’s #EveryDayJFK video—our hope is that the attention paid to President Kennedy on this anniversary will inspire a new generation of Americans to heed his call to public service.

For people alive at the time, Kennedy’s assassination was one of those events so shocking that you remember where you were when you heard the news. I was getting off a train in Nairobi when I saw the dramatic headline. Though his life had been plagued by illness, Kennedy projected an image of youth and vigor that added to the drama and poignancy of his death.
How might history have been different if he had survived? In my recent book, Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era, I divide presidents into those who are transformational in their objectives, pursuing large visions related to major changes; and those who are transactional, more focused on pragmatic issues of making the metaphorical trains run on time, and keeping them on the tracks. Because he was an activist and a great communicator with an inspirational style, Kennedy appeared to be a transformational president. He campaigned in 1960 on a promise to “get the country moving again.”
Kennedy’s inaugural address appealed to sacrifice and asking not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. He instituted programs like the Peace Corps, a manned landing on the moon, and an Alliance for Progress with Latin America. But despite his activism and rhetoric, Kennedy was a cautious rather than an ideological personality. In the words of the presidential historian Fred Greenstein, “in fact Kennedy had little in the way of an overarching perspective.”
Rather than being critical of Kennedy for not living up to his rhetoric, we should be grateful that in critical situations, he was prudent and transactional rather than ideological and transformational. The most important thing that Kennedy did during his brief presidency was to manage the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and avoid what was probably the highest risk of nuclear war in the last century. Kennedy learned from his failures at the Bay of Pigs and created a careful process for managing the crisis that arose after the Soviet Union placed nuclear weapons in Cuba. While many of his advisors, including the military, urged an air strike and invasion which we now know might have led Soviet field commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, Kennedy played for time and kept options open as he negotiated a stand-down with Nikita Khrushchev. What is more, Kennedy learned from the near miss of the Cuban Missile Crisis and on June 10, 1963, he gave a speech that began the process of easing the tensions of the Cold War. In his words, “I speak of peace, therefore, as the rational end of rational men.” While a presidential vision of peace was not new, Kennedy followed it up by negotiating the first nuclear arms control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty.
The great unanswerable question of his presidency is whether he would have saved us from the folly of the Vietnam War. Historians have argued both sides of that question, but we shall never know because his promise was sadly cut short. And that was a great loss.
Joseph S. Nye, University Distinguished Service Professor and former dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, was a Harvard Ph.D. candidate in government in the fall of 1963.

John F. Kennedy spent his short life in public service as a decorated naval officer, a member of the U.S. House and Senate, and then, at 43, as our youngest elected President. He issued a call in his inaugural address for all Americans to serve others and to ask what they could do for their country.
Charismatic and telegenic, he stumbled badly at the outset of his presidency when he approved a plan to invade Castro’s Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, then was sobered by his meeting with the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, in Vienna and by the erection of the Berlin Wall.
At the height of the Cold War, his image—young, vibrant, handsome, articulate—contrasted sharply with his Soviet counterpart and boosted America’s standing abroad.
His enthusiasm for space exploration reflected the American desire to accomplish ambitious goals and to explore the next frontier. His steady, resolute, creative decision making in the Cuban missile crisis averted war and gave Americans renewed confidence in their political leadership.
He succeeded in lowering marginal tax rates and his signature legislative achievement, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, provided the impetus for a global reduction in trade barriers that helped propel economies around the world down the path of prosperity.
At the time of his assassination on that dark November day in Dallas, he had gained confidence in his pragmatic approach to problem solving. How he would have dealt with Vietnam and whether he would have been able to pursue successfully an ambitious legislative agenda should he have been reelected remain the great unanswered questions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his assassination, Harvard will host a series of events to honor the legacy of President John F. Kennedy ’40 on Friday.
The Harvard Kennedy School and the Institute of Politics will broadcast a live webcast of an event at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum to pay tribute to the late Kennedy, who was also a former Crimson business editor. 
The ceremony will include performances from singer-songwriter James Taylor and the United States Naval Academy’s Women’s Glee Club, as well as readings of Kennedy’s most notable speeches, one of which will presented by Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick '78.
“It’ll be short, solemn, with very little speaking, which I think is the appropriate thing to do,” C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of the IOP, said. 
The broadcast, which will be shown in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, will begin at 1:30 p.m., pausing for a moment of silence around 2 p.m. when Kennedy’s death was publicly announced half a century ago.
“We thought it made the most sense to participate...to show support for a sister institution,” Grayson said. 
After the webcast, Kennedy School faculty will recount their experiences of Kennedy’s assassination during an event sponsored by the Center for Public Leadership and co-coordinated by professors Richard D. Parker, Marshall L. Ganz  '64, David R. Gergen, and Patricia S. Bellinger '83. The gathering will take place in the Malkin Penthouse of the Littauer House.
On Friday, the museum at the Kennedy Presidential Library will also open an exhibit presenting artifacts from the President’s state funeral, many of which will be on public display for the first time.
These events will conclude JFK 50, the celebration by the IOP, the Kennedy School, and the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation that began nearly three years ago with the 50th anniversary of the President’s inauguration.
 
Beyond the JFK 50 celebration, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study will host a screening of the film, “Letters to Jackie: Remembering President Kennedy,” a documentary film directed by Oscar-winner Bill Couturie. Ellen Fitzpatrick, a former fellow at the Radcliffe Institute and author of “Letters to Jackie,” will be in attendance at the screening.
Owen W. Andrews, research manager at the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School, said that these commemorative events are important to recognize the profound impact of Kennedy’s presidency.
“I was only six at the time of his death, but I know from uncles, aunts, people in my life that he was an inspiration to a lot of people,” Andrews said. “People joined the Peace Corps because of him. People chose careers they otherwise might not have chosen because of his calls to action. His presidency was a breath of fresh air.” 
Grayson said that Harvard students should commemorate Kennedy because of the relevance of this legacy today.
“Part of Harvard’s mission is to train good citizens,” Grayson said. “President Kennedy is right that there’s an obligation for people like us to participate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 22, 2013, at 4:42 a.m.
After winning the Undergraduate Council presidential election with a plurality of votes on Thursday night, Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 said they will resign from their positions immediately after they are instated as UC president and vice president, respectively.
The UC Election Commission announced late Thursday night that Clark and Mayopoulos–the joke ticket–won with 1,375 votes out of 3,181 votes cast, 155 more than C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15. Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15 came in third with 586 votes.
In a statement to the UC Election Commission provided to The Crimson, Clark and Mayopoulos confirmed that they will not serve as UC president and vice president.
"We technically can't yet, but as soon as we can, we hereby resign the offices of President and Vice-President of the Harvard Undergraduate Council," the statement read.
The candidates' statement closed with the line, "LONG LIVE DEAN EVELYNN HAMMONDS." 
The resignation of both a UC president and vice president simultaneously is unprecedented in recent UC history. The last time a president or vice president resigned was in 2005, when UC Vice President Ian W. Nichols ’06 resigned halfway through his term. 
In an email sent to two UC list-servs after Clark and Mayopoulos’s announcement, UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 wrote that the Council will proceed with inauguration plans for Dec. 8. If either Clark or Mayopoulos refuse to be inaugurated or they are inaugurated and immediately resign, Raghuveer wrote that the UC will vote on the president and vice president positions in the same meeting, pursuant to Section 42.1 of the Council Bylaws.
Shortly after results were announced, both Gong and Nwokike said in interviews with The Crimson that the vote for Clark and Mayopoulos is going to be “a wake up call” for the UC.
“It really shows a lack of confidence with the Council and our efforts, and I really wish that wasn’t the case because we do do everything for the students,” Nwokike said.
Turnout in the election decreased by more than 400 votes from last year’s election, with 3,181 undergraduates, or almost 47 percent of the student body, casting a ballot.
CHANGING THE VOTE COUNTING METHOD 
Though traditionally the UC election has been conducted under the Hare-Clark voting system, in which students have been able to cast a ballot preferentially ranking all of the tickets, an inadvertent error by the UC Election Commission disallowed that option in violation of election rules. As a result, the Commission and all three tickets agreed to switch the counting system from the Hare-Clark voting system to a plurality system, given that the error was not caught until Monday night after voting had already begun. 
Under the Hare-Clark voting system, if the number of first-place votes for a single ticket does not constitute a majority, then the ticket with the fewest number of first-place votes is dropped, and its votes are reapportioned to the remaining candidates based on second choices of those who ranked them first. Votes are transferred accordingly until a ticket emerges with a majority of total votes. Under the plurality system, however, the ticket with the most votes automatically wins.
Given the close margin of victory in this year’s election, it is mathematically possible that the outcome of the election could have been different had the Election Commission allowed voters to rank multiple preferences.
THE CAMPAIGN
Throughout the campaign, Clark and Mayopoulos ran on a platform focused on making tomato basil ravioli soup available at all meals and increasing the thickness of toilet paper, emphasizing that their lack of experience on the UC made them more qualified for the positions.
Conversely, Gong, Goffard, Nwokike, and Kim have all spent time on the Council, with both tickets claiming to have the most experience.
Both insider tickets also had similar platforms, with each team promising to increase student group funding and improve engagement between the Council and the student body.
However, the endorsements from student organizations for Gong-Goffard greatly exceeded those of the other candidates, with the campaign garnering support from the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, Queer Students and Allies, and the Chinese Students Association, among many others.
Gong expressed disappointment that these endorsements were not enough to put them over the edge.
“It saddens me to see that despite endorsements of so many student organizations and student leaders, students decided to vote for a ticket touting soup and toilet paper, when Sietse and I were trying to address student needs,” Gong said.
Gong and Goffard also maintained an extensive campaign network throughout the elections, self-reporting a team of 60 core supporters and more than 200 volunteers involved in publicity efforts. The Clark-Mayopoulos campaign had only a few more than a dozen students serving on its campaign, while Nwokike and Kim declined to comment on the size of their campaign.
But what Clark and Mayopoulos lacked in terms of campaign prowess, they made up for in social media outreach. By the time voting closed at noon on Thursday, their campaign Facebook page had more than 900 likes, 250 more page likes than for the other campaigns combined.
The Gong-Goffard campaign did not directly address the Clark-Mayopoulos campaign initially, but as the campaigning efforts intensified in the last few days of the election, emails from Gong and Goffard supporters increasingly referenced the integrity of the UC in light of the joke ticket’s satirical approach. 
“The UC isn't a joke–please don't treat your vote as such. Satire can point out problems, but we'll provide solutions,” read one email from a Gong-Goffard supporter sent over the Quincy House email list on Tuesday.
CLEAN SWEEP FOR REFERENDA QUESTIONS
In the second consecutive year that multiple referendum questions appeared on the UC presidential ballot, all four referenda passed with a majority of support from the students who voted in the election.
The referendum question asking Harvard to enroll in the UPASS program, a program in which Harvard would provide an MBTA pass for all students in exchange for a 50 percent discount from the MBTA, passed with 87 percent support, the highest percentage of approval of all the questions.
The referenda calling for gender-neutral housing across the College and the University endorsement of comprehensive immigration reform also passed with high support from 85 percent and 80 percent of voters, respectively.
The referendum asking the University to ban the sale and distribution of plastic water-bottles and make tap water more accessible, sponsored by the Environmental Action Committee, saw the most opposition, with only 64 percent of voters supporting the measure.
Environmental Action Committee Treasurer Alex G. Krolewski ’15 said in an interview after the release of the election results that he was happy that the referendum had passed and looks forward to the next stage of the movement.
“By the time we were doing the campaign, I wouldn’t say that we were expecting success, but given that the people we talked to seemed pretty receptive, we thought our chances were pretty good,” Krolewski said.
Although all four referendum questions garnered a majority percentage of support, the issues are non-binding on the UC because the majority of the student body did not vote.

Former Zipcar CEO Scott Griffith, appearing Thursday night at the Harvard Institute of Politics, emphasized the importance of defining a social mission to attract top talent and achieve success in private enterprises.
He spoke as part of a John. F Kennedy Jr. Forum on the “Social Impact Economy,” which brought together private and public sector leaders in social innovation.
Griffith said that Zipcar’s mission was one of social impact as well as private success: its rentals reduced car purchases and consumer spending on transportation.
“If you don’t understand the mission of your company, you won’t be as good of an employee,” he said. “Purpose-driven companies can attract and retain the best talent, especially millennials, who are attracted more than any generation to businesses that have a mission.”
While some may believe that making a profit is incompatible with doing good, panelist Tracy Palandjian ’93 described the social impact economy as “a market ecosystem that rejects the notion that goals of financial and social success are at odds.” Palandjian, CEO and co-founder of Social Finance, said that “traditional sources of funding, such as government and charity, are insufficient to address problems including recidivism and healthcare outcomes.”
According to Palandjian, Social Finance attracts private capital to invest in government-funded contracts that combat social problems.
Karen Gordon Mills ’75, a current IOP fellow and former administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, and David Wilkinson, current White House senior policy advisor for social finance and innovation, spoke about the public-private partnerships that aided the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.
“The economy was a mess for small business and the underserved population,” Mills said.
To make sure small businesses in underserved locations had access to growth funds, Mills’ group created “mini venture funds” to match the dollars of investors who went into parts of the country where venture capital was not going, she said.
However, moderator David Wood said that “the social impact economy is as much a buzz word as a thing.”
To grow the market for social change, Palandjian said that opportunities must be opened for firms, government, and investors to work together on projects that are a “win-win-win arrangement.”
“We need to encourage the government to experiment,” Palandjian. “Reality needs to catch up to hype.
Mills echoed Palandjian’s sentiments, and said businesses need to up the “action-to-talk ratio.”
“Until and unless a major set of financial players get to the table, it's going to be talk, talk, talk,” Mills said. “We're not going to be able to get it done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 60 protesters gathered in front of the Smith Campus Center on Thursday afternoon to encourage the University to support the unionization efforts of employees at the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, which is housed in a Harvard-owned building.
 
The rally stems from a petition that a majority of workers at the hotel signed in March to begin the formal process of deciding whether to join UNITE HERE! Local 26, a Massachusetts-based union that currently represents Harvard’s dining hall employees. Pro-union workers at the Doubletree—purchased by Harvard in 2005 but managed by Hilton—conducted the rally to urge the University to support their push for unionization, which Hilton management has not officially endorsed, according to protesters.
A combination of DoubleTree employees, Harvard employees and students, and representatives from local labor unions took part in the rally.
At the rally, organizer Gabriel H. Bayard  ’15, who wrote a report detailing the working conditions at the DoubleTree, shared his findings that working conditions at the DoubleTree are far worse than those of Harvard employees.
“It’s like two different worlds, as if the Charles River divides the people who have the right to be treated well and the people who do not have that right, and I thought that was unfair,” Bayard said.
Later, participants marched from the Smith Campus Center to Massachusetts Hall, where recently re-elected Cambridge city councillor Leland Cheung spoke in support of the workers’ desire for unionization.
Thus far, pro-union workers have been unable to secure the support of hotel management in pursuing the unionization process that they desire, and the University has declined to participate in the ongoing unionization discussions.
According to Local 26 organizer Rachel Kleinbaum, the workers have not yet received a response from hotel management. The only response that they have received, she said, came from the University in the form of a letter from Labor Relations Director Bill Murphy, who wrote that Harvard “respectfully declines Local 26’s request for the University to insert itself into this organizing campaign.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Murphy stated that the University “respects the legal process that calls for labor issues, including issues surrounding union organizing, to be resolved by the union and the employer.”
“Consistently, the University will support any fair process for unionization that is agreed upon between Hilton and Local 26,” he wrote.
A spokesperson from Hilton Worldwide wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson, that although Hilton supports workers’ right to unionize, the hotel management does not believe that a true majority of DoubleTree workers want to unionize. The spokesperson also indicated the Hilton’s preference for an alternative method to the card check neutrality agreement, the petition-signers’ desired method of confirming that a majority of workers wish to unionize.
“The appropriate and fairest process for determining whether a majority of employees wish to be represented is through a secret ballot election conducted by the NLRB,” the spokesperson wrote, referring to the National Labor Relations Board.
Richard B. Freeman, a Harvard economics professor and faculty co-director of the Labor and Worklife Program at the Law School, said that he believed that even though Harvard does not directly employ the DoubleTree workers, it still must step in and support the workers’ right to a fair process.
“It’s an amoral cop out,” Freeman said. “The wealthy corporation at the top of the supply chain still has some responsibility to the other people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University has sued an Ohio bell company, Chime Master Systems, for installing a clapper that allegedly caused a 24 to 30-inch crack in the bell hanging in Memorial Church.
The nearly 5,000-pound bell, which was donated in 1932 by former University President A. Lawrence Lowell  ’1877, has not been used since the crack was discovered in September 2011. Instead, it has been replaced by a mechanical chime that currently rings out over Harvard Yard at 8:40 a.m., every hour on the hour from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and during Commencement.
The University originally hired Chime Master in 2006 to conduct standard services on the bell and other related equipment. In 2011, the company recommended the installation of a replacement clapper, the metal piece that strikes the bell to make it ring.
“The puzzling part was that there was a clapper up there,” Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer, who was the acting Pusey Minister of Memorial Church at the time when the bell cracked, said during an interview with The Crimson in March.
Although Harvard possessed a spare clapper, Chime Master recommended the use of a new custom-designed clapper—which Harvard officials now claim resulted in the crack in the bell.
The new clapper was installed on June 28, 2011, without any apparent defect or harm to the bell. On Aug. 31 of the same year, when the bell began to ring again as students returned for the fall semester, Meyer noted that the tone was abnormal and noticeably louder than before. He added that even a woman who lived as far away as the Law School complained about the sound.
“As a result of Chime Master’s improper work, Harvard has incurred costs in determining the cause of the crack in the Memorial Church Bell and will incur great expense for its replacement,” the Harvard complaint states.
In particular, Harvard outlines additional “intangible damages” sustained due to the “specialized and unusual character of the Memorial Church bell.” Lowell donated the bell on what was then known as “Armistice Day” to honor the Harvard students who gave their lives for their country during World War I. Inscribed on the bell, which was cast in England, are the words, “In memory of voices that are hushed.”
Jeff Crooks, the president of Chime Master, was unable to be reached for comment at press time.
According to a University official, Memorial Church will be replacing the electronic chime with an actual bell, though no final determination has been made about the next steps in that process.
Justin M. Mullane, director of communications for Memorial Church, deferred all questions to a University spokesperson.
The case between Harvard and Chime Master is now in federal court and awaits assignment to a judge.
Richard J. Riley of Murphy & Riley, P.C., the law firm representing the University, deferred all questions to Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Samuel Y. Weinstock '15 will lead the newly elected 141st Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the paper's President announced on Friday.
Weinstock, a Social Studies concentrator from Atlanta, Ga., and a Mather House resident, currently serves as a Crimson news writer. As a Central Adminstration reporter, Weinstock has covered topics ranging from the Capital Campaign to University finances. He will assume the President's post in the beginning of January.
The paper's outgoing editors elected their successors early Friday morning. The President of the 140th Guard, Robert S. Samuels '14, announced the results to The Crimson's staff soon after.
“The 141st Guard is a tremendously talented group, and their passion, skills, and dedication are exemplary,” Samuels said. “I have the utmost confidence in them, and I’m excited for the direction they’ll take the organization.”
The Crimson's next Managing Editor will be Nicholas P. Fandos '15, a Crimson news writer who currently covers the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and worked with Weinstock to spearhead the paper's coverage of last spring's email search scandal. Joseph R. Botros '15, The Crimson's current Director of Web Development, will head the organization's finances and operations as its next Business Manager.
The Crimson, founded in 1873, is the only daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., and the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper.
The Crimson chooses its leaders through an election process known as the Turkey Shoot, in which all outgoing executives are invited to participate. A successful candidate must receive at least 75 percent of the vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, the Harvard football team had one goal in mind: winning an Ivy League title. All that stood in its way was defeating Yale in the 80th rendition of The Game. But when word reached Cambridge and New Haven that President John F. Kennedy ’40 had been shot and killed in Dallas, all football plans for the weekend were abandoned.
At the time of the assassination, the team was going through regular Friday walkthroughs when a cameraman found out that the President had been shot and shouted the news down to the team.
“Just as we left the Yale Fieldhouse there was some kind of murmur [about Kennedy],” quarterback Michael H. Bassett  ’64 remembered.
After practice, the team returned to its hotel about a half hour’s drive away from the Yale campus. The news had not yet set in with the team.
“Everybody was wondering, ‘Is The Game on or is it off?’ Nobody really knew what was going on,” Bassett told The Crimson.
That afternoon, The Crimson released a statement saying that the two schools had cancelled The Game, and there was concern that it might not be rescheduled. In place of The Game, Harvard scheduled a memorial service to honor the life of the president, a former Crimson business editor, at 11 a.m. on Nov. 23 in Memorial Church.
The Harvard football team returned that evening to Cambridge and a campus in shock.
FORGETTING THE GAME
After the assassination, the Harvard-Yale tilt was the least of students’ concerns. One girl “sobbed hysterically in the front lobby [of Widener Library],” while another student “stood on the grass in the yard, pounding a tree…with his fist.”
But the two schools decided that the show had to go on, despite the national tragedy. After much thought, the universities came to a consensus and chose to reschedule The Game for the next Saturday, Nov. 30.
Before the assassination, CBS had planned to televise the Harvard-Yale contest on the 23rd. But because of Kennedy’s death and The Game’s postponement to the next week, the Game was not televised after all.
Since The Game was scheduled for the weekend after Thanksgiving, there was decidedly less interest in the contest, as undergraduates already had plans to return home for the break. Harvard offered refunds for all students who had bought tickets but were instead headed home for the holiday.
Yet despite the dearth of enthusiasm at the current moment, The Game was still to be played. Because of the week delay, four Harvard “regulars,” who were injured and would not have played in the Nov. 23 matchup, were able to rest and recover before the tilt against Yale.
Harvard entered the matchup as a slight favorite, with experts emphasizing the need for the Crimson’s defense to step up. Given the Crimson’s successful 4-1-1 record on the year, the Harvard faithful jumped at the opportunity to gamble on the even odds that the Crimson would beat the 3-3 Yale squad.
"I've never put much folding green on a college grid fray,” one anonymous Harvard student told The Crimson nine days before The Game. "But at these odds, I'm tempted to venture at least 20 dollars on a Crimson triumph."
The seniors on the Harvard team had even more incentive to beat the Bulldogs. With a victory on Saturday, they would have become the first upperclassmen since the Class of 1931 to secure three straight victories over their archrival.
A RESCHEDULED GAME
Despite the hype placed on The Game before the assassination, the motivation to make history was not enough for Harvard to take down the Bulldogs, losing 20-6.
As The Crimson predicted, the need for a strong defense proved to be true. Following kickoff, both teams turned the ball over multiple times. Neither offense was able  to scrape together more than one touchdown apiece during the first thirty minutes.
If the first half carried concerns for Harvard, the second half of the game brought even more. Yale dominated in the last two quarters in all facets of the game. The Bulldogs achieved 13 first downs to Harvard's five, 161 rushing yards to Harvard's 22, and 13 points to Harvard's none in order to extend their lead out of the visitors’ reach.
With the loss, Princeton and Dartmouth each earned a share of the Ancient Eight crown. The Tigers and Big Green both sat on top of the standings with a 5-2 record in conference play on the year.
While Harvard played for the Ivy League title, Kennedy’s death still weighed heavily on people’s minds. Back in Cambridge, plans were already underway to name various libraries and even the city hospital after the late president. Due to the tragic circumstances in which the contest took place, The Game—synonymous with bitter rivalry and unmatched enthusiasm from fans—was in 1963 little more than just a game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the students of Harvard pack their overnight bags and head to New Haven for the 130th Harvard-Yale game this weekend, they may be surprised to see which Harvard players take a starting position the field.
Due to an abnormally large amount of injuries this season, fans can expect to see a number of preseason second and third-stringers in the Yale Bowl on Saturday.
The Crimson (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) has not seen an injury-free week since the team’s opening game against the University of San Diego in late September. Key players  sidelined this season inc lude senior kicker David Mothander, senior tight end Cameron Brate, junior linebacker Connor Sheehan, sophomore running back Zach Boden, senior center David Leopard, sophomore wide receiver Andrew Fischer, and junior starting quarterback Conner Hempel.
In Harvard’s matchup against Dartmouth on Nov. 2, about half of the offensive starting lineup was composed of prior second-teamers. Playing without multiple starters, the team eventually secured a 24-21 win against the Big Green.
“Every week there’s someone going down,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We’re constantly being challenged, but we just keep filling in the gaps.”
Several of the squad’s recent injuries have changed the defense: junior defensive tackle Obum Obukwelu and his brother, fifth-year senior Nnamdi Obukwelu, both went down in November matchups. Fellow senior tackle Jack Dittmer is still recovering from an ankle injury and last week junior defensive back Norman Hayes suffered an injury that might prevent him from suiting up in this weekend’s matchup against the Bulldogs.
“We didn’t expect Nnamdi to be able to play [against Penn]…and Dittmer was only in for nine plays because his ankle was so bad,” Murphy said, “Those guys were in uniform and played some, but they were clearly not 100 percent.”
Despite the injuries, Harvard has seen success thus far this season. The team will enter The Game having fallen only to Princeton in a triple-overtime contest.
Junior kicker Andrew Flesher, called upon after first-string Mothander was injured in practice, attributes the Crimson’s success to both a deep bench and good attitudes.
“We have a good team,” Flesher said. “And if everyone is ready and is in the right mindset to step into the game, then everything should go pretty smoothly even with the injuries.”
In fact, some of the most critical plays of the season have come from second-string players unexpectedly propelled into action.
“Here’s some adversity, here’s a challenge, here’s a great opportunity,” Murphy said. “We look at [the injuries] as an opportunity and not as something that’s really negative. We don’t spend much time thinking about it.”
Running back Paul Stanton was amongst the many who were called upon to step up in a number of close games throughout the season. The sophomore has tallied 818 total yards and a team-high 13 touchdowns.
Flesher was named Ivy League Special Teams Player of the Week twice this season and made a total of seven field goals on 10 attempts.
“We don’t let [the injuries] affect [the attitude] at all,” Murphy said. “We don’t make a big deal out of it and we don’t talk about them with the players at all.”
After being edged out of the starting position by Hempel, senior quarterback Michael Pruneau was granted the opportunity to prove his abilities when Hempel suffered a minor knee injury in the team’s 41-35 triple-overtime win against Holy Cross on Oct. 5.
Pruneau made his debut as starter against Cornell. The Texas native completed 23 of 29 passes for 340 yards and scored twice as the Crimson ultimately topped the Big Red, 34-24. The senior returned the following week to defeat Lafayette and passed for 263 yards and three touchdowns.
“We have found a way to play to our best possible strength under the circumstances,” Murphy said.
Looking ahead, Murphy and his team are not preoccupied with the injuries going into The Game.
“[Our] players may be banged up, but they have been extremely tough and resilient in finding a way to play to their best possible strength under the circumstances.” Murphy said, “[The Bulldogs] have had their fair share of injuries too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Yale finished dead last in the Ivy League. But it didn’t seem that way when the Bulldogs came to Cambridge.
With its opponents putting up a tremendous fight, Harvard found itself trailing by four points with less than five minutes remaining in The Game.
In the end, the Crimson converted two late touchdowns to prevail, 34-24. Though it won The Game, Harvard learned from the showdown that past results do not matter. At Harvard-Yale, anything can happen.
Teams will debut new offensive looks, play with an intensity unmatched in earlier conference matchups, and pull out all the stops to achieve a season-making victory.
“In the first half [last year], we had to make a lot of adjustments,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We expect the same thing. What do we expect? We’re not sure. So expect the unexpected.”
The storied rivalry will continue this Saturday when Harvard (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) travels to New Haven for the 130th rendition of The Game. Just like last year, the Crimson is the better team, currently in second place in the Ancient Eight and one play away from an undefeated record.
But the 2012 matchup proved that the Bulldogs (5-4, 3-3) can contend with any Harvard squad. And this year, the Crimson will go up against a much-improved Yale team.
Entering the final game of the season with the potential to finish over .500 for the first time since 2010, the Bulldogs have demonstrated their offensive capability in recent weeks. Yale rode a last-minute touchdown to a 24-17 victory over Brown two games ago, and the team scored over 50 points against Columbia a week earlier.
Last year, the Bulldogs struggled to put a quarterback on the field, but their approach this year resembles that of quarterback by committee. Four different players dropped back to pass against Brown.
Henry Furman led the way with two touchdown passes in that game and has 10 total on the season. Sophomore Morgan Roberts, a transfer from Clemson, is also a competent pocket presence and will likely see snaps against the Crimson.
Yale’s biggest offensive threat, however, is another member of the backfield. A preseason All-American, junior running back Tyler Varga is likely to suit up against Harvard after missing the past four games with an injury.
In Varga’s absence, Yale heavily relied upon wide receiver Deon Randall. The junior is averaging over 80 receiving yards a game and has caught eight touchdowns—three of which came in the Bulldogs’ win over Cornell in the second week of the season.
With the Harvard defense ranking last in the Ivy League against the pass, Randall and his fellow receivers may be targeted frequently come Saturday.
“[Yale is] just better everywhere,” Murphy said. “They’re relatively young on defense, but it’s an impressive unit. They’re extremely athletic with great potential.”
Plagued by injuries all season, the Crimson will once again rely on a starting lineup in flux. The return of senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu aided a battered Harvard defense last week against Penn. But as one player came in, another went out, as junior defensive back Norman Hayes exited with a leg injury.
The main focus on the Crimson sideline heading into the annual showdown will be consistency. Fueled by a strong Hempel performance and the return of senior tight end Cam Brate, who caught the first touchdown against the Quakers last Saturday, Harvard held a 38-point lead early in the third quarter.
But things went downhill from there. The Crimson did not convert a first down on its final five drives and allowed 30 straight Penn points in what was nearly the biggest comeback in college football history.
“We really took it to Penn [in the first half], but we kind of took the foot off the pedal a little bit,” Brate said. “That’s something that we definitely can’t do this week in the Yale game. Momentum, once you lose it, it is hard to get back.”
Harvard has dominated The Game’s recent history, having won 11 of the past 12 contests. The Crimson will look to extend a six-game winning streak over its longtime rivals in front of a packed house on Saturday.
But history has also shown it won’t be easy. And that’s been the theme of Harvard’s season. When players have gone down to injury, others have stepped up to shoulder a bigger load.
“Usually we’re at 8-1 at Harvard going to New Haven, and we’re rolling,” Murphy said. “We’re not rolling. We’re just a really tough team. I’ll take that any day.”
Indeed, the Crimson will need another team effort in New Haven if its 36 seniors are to end their careers on a high note.
“Beating Yale is always beautiful,” said senior defensive back D.J. Monroe. “The glory of going out on top, winning my last game, would be a memory I [would] have for a lifetime.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year was 1968. But in the midst of the chaos of the Vietnam War, a different battle was brewing. This one would take place on American soil—in Harvard Stadium.
Just as they do on every even-numbered year, the Yale Bulldogs were coming to Boston, this time to take on the Harvard Crimson in the 85th playing of The Game.
The clash of the storied rivals was one that dated back nearly a century and had ended the Bulldogs’ and Crimson’s schedules for nearly 70 years running. Even if the circumstances hadn’t lined up perfectly, The Game would have been huge.
“You could lose every game in the season, but it’s a winning season if you beat Yale,” said Harvard end receiver Bruce Freeman ’71.
But this meeting was different. The circumstances did line up.
And even 45 years later, the details are still clear in the minds of those who took the field that day.
A TALE OF TWO TEAMS
A scriptwriter couldn’t have created a better matchup. Entering The Game, both teams were 8-0, and the result of Saturday’s contest would determine the Ivy champion. But despite the parallel in record, the undefeated teams were anything but similar.
In one corner, there was Yale. At the helm was senior quarterback Brian Dowling, who had built up a legendary reputation across the country. Through eighth grade, high school, and collegiate football, Dowling had never lost a game that he finished. So entering The Game, Dowling was riding a nine-year self-assuredness high.
“I think you build up confidence throughout history, and I had confidence from high school and from my [college] teammates, so I just couldn’t wait to play each week,” Dowling said.
Lining up next to Dowling was halfback Calvin Hill. Named NFL Rookie of the Year in 1969 while with the Dallas Cowboys, Hill was the first Ivy League graduate to be drafted in the first round of the NFL.
“[Bulldogs coach] Carmen Cozza said that in his 32 years coaching at Yale, [Hill] was the only player he had that could have played all 22 positions,” Dowling said. “Some people say if you’ve got a shotgun, you shoot it. With Calvin, I just tried to get him the ball as much as possible. The more I could get him the ball, the better—he was such an incredible athlete.”
With Dowling and Hill leading the offense, Yale became unstoppable.
“More than anything else, it was exciting,” Bulldogs safety JP Goldsmith remembered. “We had the longest winning streak in the nation, we knew we were going to win, we had Dowling and Hill, and it just didn’t occur to us that we were going to lose.”
And with just one game left, Yale hadn’t lost yet. Predicted in the preseason to be the Ivy League champs, the Bulldogs were rolling coming into their final game of the season—the Elis had outscored every opponent before Harvard by at least two scores.
In the other corner, there was Harvard.
“I remember [team captain and halfback] Victor Gatto [’69] telling us in the bowels of the stadium that we were going to be undefeated, and I remember sharing skepticism with my teammates on that,” said Crimson offensive guard Tommy Lee Jones ’69.
The 1968 Harvard team did go undefeated, but, for an offense rebuilding after graduating a strong senior class, games were not won with style points.
A suffocating defense held all Ivy League opponents to 14 points or fewer, but relying on defense also meant that the Crimson never routed opponents the way that Yale did.
“We were more of a blue-collar team that wasn’t expected to be good,” said Harvard defensive end John Cramer ’70. “I think we were picked for the second division of the Ivy League that year. Somehow, we kept winning, and not by a lot. We ended up having a pretty good defense, which is what I think carried us through much of the year.”
But the impressive victories Yale racked up throughout the season carried with them a sea of momentum. Two weeks before The Game, Harvard squeaked by Princeton, 9-7. The next week, Yale downed Princeton handily, 42-17.
“Everybody believed that Yale was by far the dominant team,” Gatto said. “They had that kind of notoriety, and obviously when you’re the great offensive team, you have a lot more publicity. So they had all of that going for them. Everybody expected that they’d roll us.”
THE GAME
In a sold-out stadium in Allston, the stage was set for the most prolific offense to meet the most stifling defense in the league.
“We all got complimentary tickets, and back in those days, some people were able to scalp their tickets for 50 dollars a piece (worth over $300 in 2012), which was outrageously high-priced back then,” Cramer said.
Forty-thousand people packed into Harvard Stadium to watch the hyped-up action, and at first, the game didn’t deliver.
“Sports Illustrated called it one of the 10 greatest games in college football history, but you know what? I don’t think it really was,” Cramer said. “It was a pretty boring game for the first 59 minutes. Yale was so dominant, they kind of pushed us around.”
The Bulldogs jumped out to a 22-0 lead by the second quarter, and Harvard coach John Yovicsin decided that it was time for a change. He pulled starting quarterback George Lalich ’69 from the game and put backup Frank Champi ’70 in his place.
Lalich had quarterbacked the team through the season, while Champi had only seen action in garbage time.
“[Champi’s] from one of the places up on the North Shore and has a really thick Boston accent,” Cramer said. “So when he got into the huddle, he was a little nervous, and he had this Boston accent, and nobody could understand what he was saying. We couldn’t understand the play he was calling because he was nervous and had this funny accent.”
What Champi didn’t have in experience, he made up for with arm strength. As a member of the Harvard track and field team, the junior would go on to be second-team All-Ivy for javelin throwing in his senior year. But Champi was still a junior playing among veterans, which showed in his lack of confidence.
“I thought Frank was going to die,” Jones said. “He had a hell of an arm, and I was very happy to see that arm prevail, but he wasn’t particularly inspirational until he brought that arm to that game and that moment.”
But Champi channeled his nerves into anger.
“When I first got into the game, I was very nervous and surprised, but that quickly evolved into something else,” Champi said. “Basically, I was a little pissed off. I felt like I was getting thrown to the wolves. But there are no expectations, so something has to kick in. Either you worry about it and you fret about it, or you say, ‘Ah, frick it. I’ll do what I can and not give a damn.’”
That emotion fueled a Crimson drive that finally got the home team on the board at the end of the half, when Champi hit Freeman for a 15-yard touchdown strike. But entering halftime, the home team was still trailing the Elis, 22-6.
“I was just embarrassed,” Harvard fullback Gus Crim ’70 said. “I just remember thinking, ‘Wow, we can’t play a whole lot worse than this, and they are kicking our tails all over this field.’”
Harvard cut the deficit to nine in the early minutes of the second half off a one-yard Crim touchdown run. But Dowling answered early in the fourth quarter, effortlessly moving the chains before running in a score himself. Yale led 29-13 with 10 minutes left.
COMEBACK CHAMPI
Bulldogs fans jeered from the sidelines, waving handkerchiefs tauntingly at the Harvard sidelines. After all, up by 16 with just four minutes to play, what could they possibly have to fear?
But then, disaster struck for Yale.
“We were driving down the field, and I threw a screen pass to the fullback, who cut back and got tackled at the 20-yard line,” Dowling remembered. “He tried to lateral it to Calvin and fumbled.”
The fumble was Yale’s sixth on the day.
“Six fumbles,” Goldsmith said. “When you have six fumbles lost, you usually lose 38 to nothing.”
The Crimson took over with two and a half minutes left. Facing a third and impossibly long situation near midfield, Champi coughed up the ball under pressure.
“The play I remember most was Mr. 75, Mr. Fritz Reed [’70],” Goldsmith recalled. “The longest run from scrimmage was when No. 75, the Harvard tackle, picked up a Champi fumble and lumbered for 25 yards.”
Reed’s run set up Harvard at the Bulldog 15, and Champi connected with Freeman to finish the drive. 29-19, Yale.
With under a minute to play, the Crimson had to opt for the two-point conversion attempt. The play, as Gatto remembered, was designed for Champi to find either halfback Pete Varney ’71 or Gatto. Champi lofted a pass to Varney that was swiftly batted down by a Yale defensive back, seemingly crushing a Harvard comeback.
And then another gift in the form of a yellow flag. A controversial interference call forced the Yale defense to replay the conversion.
“If I were coaching on the Yale sideline, I wouldn’t have liked it, and they definitely didn’t like it,” Gatto said. “Our guy was big, and the defensive back trying to come around him did grab him a little bit. So without that, everything else wouldn’t have happened.”
On take two, Crim punched it in. 29-21, Yale.
42 SECONDS
With just 42 seconds remaining in the game and down by eight, Harvard had to go for the onside kick. And in a situation that calls on fundamentals, the Bulldogs special teams proved far from special.
“We didn’t have a hands team,” Goldsmith said. “That’s like going to a golf course and leaving your putter and your wedge at home. I mean, come on—it’s a tool, everybody has to have one. You may not need one, but you have to come prepared.”
The kick bounced off of the chest of a Yale offensive guard, and Harvard’s Bill Kelly ’71 fell on top of it. Crimson ball at midfield, 42 seconds on the clock.
Champi ran a sweep on the next play, and then the floodgates opened for Eli mistakes. A facemask penalty on that play moved the Crimson to the Yale 20.
At Gatto’s urging, the offensive coordinator called a draw for Crim, catching the Bulldogs defense off guard with a 14-yard run. With 15 seconds left, Harvard was already at the Yale six.
“By now, everybody’s come out of the stands,” Gatto remembered. “People are lining the field all around the end zone. Refs pause everything to try to pull people back.”
But the comeback stalled when Champi dropped back to pass on the next play and was sacked. The Crimson burned its last timeout. One play, eight yards, and just three seconds remained in The Game.
Champi ran the same play as the two-point conversion, looking towards Varney, then to Gatto.
“Champi gets the ball, runs around like a chicken with his head cut off,” Cramer said. “The clock meanwhile has expired—the play probably took 10 seconds, this last play.”
The backup quarterback scrambled furiously out of the pocket, looking right, then left.
“I had a sense that I was kind of protected,” Champi said. “I expected to get hit, and then there was the sensation that there was a force field around me, and then the voice inside me said, ‘Okay, now move.’”
Champi moved, saw Gatto out of the corner of his eye, and floated the ball to the halfback in the end zone a split second before a Yale lineman brought him down.
Touchdown, Harvard. Harvard Stadium erupted.
“I got tackled by three Yale guys and jumped on by 300 fans,” Gatto remembered.
But Yale still had the two-point edge.
When the referees finally herded the crowds back behind the chalk, Champi and company lined up for the two-point conversion.
“It was as if the world had just stopped,” Cramer said. “It makes you wonder if there was this otherworldly kind of thing going on that made it inevitable that this second two-point conversion was going to happen.”
The Crimson elected to try the same play as the previous conversion and touchdown. Champi looked to Varney, threaded the ball to Varney, and this time, he hung on. 29-29, Harvard.
‘THE MOST WINNING TIE IN HISTORY’
“The stadium just emptied,” Cramer recalled. “The Yale sideline was just stunned. I think there were three heart attack victims that day in the stands among Yale fans. Harvard fans poured out.”
Dowling, who played safety in high school, had asked his coach to put him in on defense in the final minute. Cozza refused, and the unbeaten quarterback watched from the sidelines as his unblemished record slipped away.
“It was very frustrating to end our college careers on a down note, but it wasn’t a loss,” Dowling said. “So that was the consolation. Some newspaper reporters after The Game came up to me and asked how it felt to finally lose a game, and I said, ‘I thought it was a tie.’”
Dowling would join a number of his teammates that year, including Hill, in the NFL draft, but that day, the success was all Harvard’s. The scoreboard may have reflected a tie, but to both teams, it felt like anything but.
“It felt worse than a loss,” Goldsmith said. “It was surreal. I don’t remember coming off of the field. I do remember their locker room was noisy. They were high-fiving each other, and you could have heard a pin drop in our locker room.”
The game was, for the most part, a dominant Yale performance. But the final 42 seconds, when Champi strung together that miraculous 16-0 run, are all history seems to recall.
“We didn’t deserve to win the game,” Crim said. “It almost would have been disrespectful to a very great Yale team that they had lost that game. I remember walking off of the field with Calvin Hill, and it felt okay to me that it felt like we won, but we tied, and that’s the way it should have ended.”
The 1996 change in NCAA rules that added overtime ensured that the 29-29 tie would be the eighth and final in the Harvard-Yale rivalry, locking the game in posterity.
“There are a lot of close games that come down to the wire, and there are thrilling endings,” Champi said. “But typically what happens is that teams get close, they’re fighting to come back, and something happens. But that day, everything fell into place.”
A missed extra point. Six fumbles. A controversial pass interference call. An imperfect onside kick that ended up working out perfectly. Everything did fall into place at Harvard Stadium on Nov. 23, 1968 in a fitting culmination of a highly anticipated game.
And even though the record books show the Crimson and the Elis sharing the 1968 Ivy League championship, those who witnessed and played in that game know the real story, and maintain their opinions, even 45 years later.
“It was absolutely the most winning tie in history,” Cramer said. “No doubt about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was fourth down, and the Harvard football team was in trouble. Already trailing 13-0 to Princeton, junior quarterback Conner Hempel dropped back and lofted a deep pass into the end zone. When the ball deflected off a Tigers defender, the Crimson’s drive seemed to be over.
But senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn tracked the football in the air, dove forward at an angle, and reeled it in to complete the 33-yard touchdown pass. Zorn would finish the game with 168 receiving yards.
A week later, junior tight end Tyler Hamblin posted a team-high 56 receiving yards and was a constant target in a 34-0 win over Columbia. Hamblin has registered at least one catch in each of the Crimson’s last six games.
Upon coming to Harvard, Zorn and Hamblin expected to contribute heavily to the Crimson’s success. That’s exactly what they have done—but not exactly how they might have expected.
Zorn and Hamblin both played quarterback in high school. Now, instead of dropping back to pass, the two players are on the other end of the aerial attack. Instead of making plays with their arms, they now do so with their hands.
In a season plagued with injuries, Zorn and Hamblin have become two consistent faces in a rotating Crimson offense. They may not be playing the position that brought them to Harvard in the first place, but their contributions have helped fuel the team to an 8-1 record entering the final game of the year.
TIME FOR A CHANGE
The adjustment is never easy. College football is enough of a step up from the high school level. The thought of learning a new position as well is enough to make even the most assured athlete apprehensive.
“You never shove it down their throat,” Murphy said. “Kids feel their eligibility clock ticking, and they just want to play. In Ricky and Tyler’s case, they’re like, ‘Coach, whatever you say. Whatever’s best for the team.’”
Both players had always possessed the physical qualities to make it as a pass catcher at the collegiate level. In high school in Dallas, Tex., Zorn played football, basketball, baseball, and track and field. He was recruited not only as a quarterback, but also as an athlete.
“[Zorn is] very fast, he’s got great body control, and he’s got great hands,” Murphy said. “So he’s a total package in that regard. But the other one is that he’s a very tough, physical kid. That’s not necessarily a given at the wide receiver position.”
Directing his own high school offense behind center, Hamblin led his squad to two straight state championship games. At 6’4”, Hamblin had the height to toss touchdowns over the heads of defensive linemen. But the potential to out-jump defensive backs for high passes lurked as well.
Hamblin spent his freshman year at Harvard at quarterback. But after the spring season, Murphy called him into his office and proposed making a transition to tight end. Both he and offensive coordinator Joel Lamb believed that making the switch was the best way for Hamblin to get on the field as soon as possible.
“[They] thought I could benefit and the team could benefit from the move,” Hamblin said.
When it comes down to it, a team can only use one quarterback at a time. But different sets ensure that as many as four tight ends get action within a single game, and at least five different wide receivers typically catch passes on a given Saturday.
That reality occurred to Hamblin, as it did to Zorn. When Zorn was a freshman, Harvard’s QB depth chart was clogged up with bigger names such as Collier Winters, Colton Chapple, and Michael Pruneau. The coaching staff originally proposed using Zorn’s athletic ability at cornerback, but a torn labrum requiring surgery put him on the sideline for his entire freshman season.
At the end of the year while in a meeting with Murphy, Zorn floated the idea that he learn the offense to gain experience at the wide receiver position.
“[Murphy] emailed me the very next day, saying, ‘I’ve been thinking about your interest in playing wide receiver, and I think it would be great if you went ahead and made the switch,’ Zorn said. “That’s how I switched to wide receiver.”
A LEARNING PROCESS
Zorn and Hamblin may be thriving today, but it wasn’t always that way. It took lots of practice and a significant adjustment period to acclimate to a new role.
Hamblin began his sophomore fall as the low man on the totem pole. Possessing good hands, the receiving aspect came relatively quickly. But playing on the line brought along new challenges, from run blocking to route running.
For Hamblin, the presence of then-senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk, who now plays for the Baltimore Ravens, was crucial. Along with senior tight end Cam Brate, Juszczyk took Hamblin under his wing and taught him the ins and outs of the position.
“The biggest thing for me moving to tight end was learning how to block,” Hamblin said. “What helped me was watching film and watching the line so much that I could pick up the footwork relatively quickly. I just had to get in the weight room and get stronger.”
Zorn spent the summer after his freshman year training with Pruneau, also a rising sophomore from the Lone Star State then. He studied the offense over the offseason, started becoming familiar with the wide receiver position, and played much of his sophomore year on the JV squad.
Zorn made his first collegiate start his junior year against Holy Cross. He came out with a bang, amassing 99 receiving yards and reeling in a touchdown. With only one year of wide receiver experience under his belt, Zorn registered a catch in every 2012 game.
“He missed his whole freshman year because of surgery, so it took a little longer to sink in that maybe quarterback wasn’t going to be his position,” Murphy said. “But the way it’s turned out, I think everybody’s really happy.”
Zorn’s quarterback background helped him pick up the nuances of being a wideout more quickly than he would have otherwise. Even though he had never played the position, he knew what receivers needed to do to contribute to an aerial attack and mesh with their quarterbacks.
“Quarterbacks are always trying to coach their wide receivers,” Zorn said. “So they have a good idea what it takes to be a wide receiver, even though they haven’t gone out there and actually ran routes in practices.”
According to Hamblin, being a quarterback gave him the soft hands he needed to aid the transition to tight end. But his experience directing an offense was just as critical on the mental side of things, having learned firsthand how helpful it is when receivers are detail-oriented.
“One of the things about Tyler that’s allowed him to really blossom is that he approaches the game like a quarterback,” Murphy said. “He’s one of those guys in meetings who is probably more well-versed in our offense in general and the nuances of his position than anybody in our meeting room.”
HARD WORK PAYS OFF
Besides sophomore running back Paul Stanton, Zorn has been the most consistent offensive player for the Crimson so far this year. Through nine games, the preseason All-Ivy third-teamer leads all Harvard receivers with 44 receptions and 661 yards —more than twice the total for any other team member.
Zorn uses his quickness to create separation on short crosses and possesses the necessary speed and strength to beat cornerbacks on fade and post routes. His biggest game this season came in an eight-reception, 168-yard performance against Princeton. The receiver has not forgotten how to throw the ball, either—Zorn tossed a 32-yard touchdown pass on a trick play against Dartmouth.
Indeed, Zorn has progressed from a novice wide receiver to one of the most important members of the 2013 Harvard team.
“[Zorn] doesn’t say much, but he delivers,” Murphy said. “He’s one of those kids that everybody respects because he’s a man of few words, extremely dependable, extremely competitive, and everybody has tremendous respect for him because he’s so dependable and durable.”
While Hamblin’s impact has been more limited than Zorn’s, the junior from Syracuse, N.Y., has begun to emerge in recent weeks as a reliable target.
The junior caught his first career touchdown on a 36-yard strike down the sideline against Cornell and has 12 receptions in six games, including a five-reception, 56-yard effort against Columbia.
Hamblin was forced to miss time at the beginning of the current season with tonsillitis, but when an injury sidelined Brate for two games a couple of weeks later, Hamblin responded with seven catches in the pair of contests.
“When you have guys go down [to injuries], it’s depressing,” Hamblin said. “So it was pretty cool to go down and need to step back up for the team at the end of the year.”
When Zorn moved to wide receiver and Hamblin was made a tight end, both players needed to acquire a revamped skill set to adapt. They have both done so successfully, using their athleticism and a sophisticated knowledge of the game they acquired while leading from behind center.
But while the daily routines have changed, for both Zorn and Hamblin, one characteristic that every good quarterback needs has remained an integral part of their approach: leadership. And for all of Harvard’s wide receivers and tight ends—along with the team as a whole—that’s a good thing.
“Both guys are absolutely the leaders of their group,” Murphy said. “Part of it is they’re always prepared…. They make very few mistakes. If you ask those guys a question, they [will] nail it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a year of experience on the Harvard football team under their belts, sophomores Paul Stanton and Eric Medes have tallied several standout performances this year on offense and defense, respectively.
During the 2012 season, neither player saw much of the field, instead working under the shadow of their elders. For Stanton, that man was then-senior running back Treavor Scales, whom Stanton studied under during a season that saw Scales lead the Ivy League with 1,002 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns.
“Last year being behind Treavor Scales…he taught me a lot about how to be a leader and what it takes,” Stanton said. “This year, I’ve tried to follow the lead and do all I can for the team.”
The original plan for the Crimson offense was to have Stanton and classmate Zach Boden split the rushing load, allowing each player to contribute to a collective effort. But when Boden went down with an injury early in the season, Stanton was called upon to display the leadership skills he had been taught the previous year.
He has not disappointed. Stanton has led the team in rushing nearly every game this season, compiling 818 yards overall and 13 rushing touchdowns. The baker’s dozen ties him for second in the Ivy League, just behind Princeton quarterback Quinn Epperly.
Stanton is third among the leading rushers in the Ancient Eight, following only Dartmouth’s Dominick Pierre and Brown’s John Spooney.
Stanton also leads the team in average yards per game (90.6), points scored (78), and points per game (8.7).
“This year I’ve had a great offensive line that’s created a lot of holes for me,” Stanton said. “I feel like I’ve gotten a chance this year [to step up], and I’m doing all I can to take advantage of it. Since I’ve been here my goal is to work as hard as I can and do as much as I can for the team.”
This transition from apprentice to offensive threat did not come overnight. During the offseason, Stanton worked on his pass blocking and improved his hands for when the team elects to run a pass play.
“Paul’s improvement level really comes down to comfort level and execution,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Last year he was kind of just thrown into it and didn’t really have a good feel for everything, including protection in the pass game and nuances of the running game. But now he really understands what his responsibilities are, what his fundamentals and techniques are, and consequently he’s a much better football player.”
Similar to Stanton, Medes also worked on his game in the offseason, although on the other side of the ball.
The work has paid off for the 6’2” linebacker, who leads the team in total tackles with 65, averaging over seven a game.
“I needed to get stronger and a little bit faster in order to keep up with the game,” Medes said. “[Freshman year], coming from high school to college there were a lot of discrepancies, but once I adjusted to the speed of the game and the scale of it I was able to develop my play.”
With a linebacker core that has been plagued with injuries this year, Medes has been called upon to contribute much more than last year.
This is a role that he and his teammates naturally stepped into, seeing the need to contribute at a time when resources were scarce.
“Everybody who is healthy is ready to play,” Medes said. “If someone goes down, the next person is ready to hop right in.”
For Medes, the highlight of his breakout year was the Sept. 28 game against Brown, which was the Crimson’s home opener. Medes contributed 10 tackles under the lights, leading the team for the night.
“I think he’s much more confident in his role and his assignments in fundamentals and techniques,” Murphy said. “As a freshman he’d run around and make some plays, but he wasn’t always where he was supposed to be when he was supposed to be there, and that’s the biggest difference. He’s the total package now.”
For both players, being out on the field as a sophomore has encouraged the veteran mentality that they have been there before and know the roots of the program a little bit better than they did a  year ago.
Although the excitement to play Harvard football is still there, the mentality of a newcomer has been replaced by the minds of experienced players who have a sense of how the program is run and what kind of performance is necessary in order for it to operate.
“This year I’ve been able to do more for the team because I’ve had they playing time,” Stanton said. “Once you get out on the field more, you have more of an opportunity [to help your team].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One afternoon in 1994, Harvard wrestling coach Jay Weiss was sitting in his office on the fourth floor of the Malkin Athletic Center when women’s volleyball coach Jennifer Bates passed his door, a common occurrence since the volleyball courts are right outside his office.
At the time, the two coaches had just solidified their positions at Harvard—Jennifer had taken over the helm of women’s volleyball in 1993 and Jay had been hired a year later. They were colleagues and not much more.
“[In the beginning,] we didn’t know each other,” Jennifer said. “I was here before he was and then when he came in that year, we [became] friends.”
But that one afternoon, Jennifer did something simple that unwittingly sparked a relationship that has lasted longer than any winning streak or championship run.
“The door was open and she walked by, then she turned back and said, ‘Can I borrow a pencil?’” Jay recalled. “And I was like, ‘Okay, so this is where we’re going with it’...She obviously didn’t need a pencil. But then we got to know each other and we ended up running around the [Charles] River [together] for the first month to a year.”
Twenty years, hundreds of victories, 67 All-Ivy or All-American players, 16 years of marriage, and two kids later, Jay and Jennifer Weiss are still going strong as spouses and Crimson head coaches.
Separately, the Weisses would likely have done well and had solid coaching careers. But united, they have left a lasting mark on Harvard athletics both inside and outside of the MAC.
CONVERGING PATHS
Though Jay and Jennifer both began their coaching careers fresh out of college, they took divergent routes to becoming head coaches for the Crimson.
While Jennifer came to Harvard immediately after finishing her master’s degree, working as an intern in the athletic department and assistant coach for the volleyball team, Jay had multiple high level coaching experiences before coming to Cambridge.
“Out of college, I was the head wrestling coach at Moravian College in Division III, and I was there for two years,” Jay said “I knew I wanted to get back into Division I. The Brown assistant job opened up…. I went from being a head coach to an assistant coach, and was at Brown for two years.”
As fate would have it, the puzzle pieces fell into place for both Weisses to take on Harvard coaching positions. For Jay, that piece was applying for a Crimson wrestling coach position that he thought his former college coach at Franklin and Marshall was the frontrunner for.
By his own account, Jay wasn’t even shooting for the Crimson job but was hoping to fill the opening at Franklin and Marshall should his former coach get the Harvard position.
The outcome wasn’t exactly the one Jay had expected.
“[My old coach] got [the position], took it, and two days later turned it down and pushed for me, so Harvard called me back up,” Jay said. “I was in the right place at the right time…I was just fortunate to have that opportunity that many years ago.”
Two decades ago, Jennifer never even saw full time coaching as a possibility until then-athletic director Bill Cleary ’56 approached her.
“At the time when I was interning, I was doing volleyball as kind of a side [job],” Jennifer said. “[Cleary] gave me the opportunity of a lifetime and…I [accepted]. I was, absolutely, at the right place at the right time.”
An awkward request for a pencil and dozens of runs along the Charles later, Jay and Jennifer were wedded, with Harvard athletics in the audience.
“We respected the administration here and they respected what we were doing with the programs,” Jennifer said. “And so, when we did get married in 1998, which was a good five years [after we had gotten here]…Cleary and all the administrators that hired us were there.”
TWO HALVES MAKE A WHOLE
Like any young coaches, the Weisses had their fair share of struggles and learning experiences. But the Crimson community was exactly the place for them to learn and grow through their mistakes and successes. Their colleagues, such as the late Harvard crew legend Harry Parker and Cleary, who was a former Harvard men’s ice hockey head, were fine coaching role models for the Weiss’.
“[At age] 25, I just wanted to win, win, win,” Jay said. “I was young and dumb and wanted to win. All I wanted to do was win and it was frustrating because it’s difficult. I kept saying this isn’t going to work, this isn’t going to work, but the more people around you talk to you, the more you understand what this place is about.”
Like the role models around them, the Weiss’ marriage taught the pair numerous lessons, such as to draw from each other’s strengths in order to develop their leadership abilities.
“My strength was definitely developing communication and people skills,” Jennifer said. “Between the two of us, [Jay] exudes passion all the time, which inspired me to develop as a coach or as a leader [who exudes that passion].”
The Crimson athletes who they have mentored over the seasons have felt the positive outputs of their relationship, as well.
“[The Weisses] complement one another in that I think they are equally ferocious competitors and just as nurturing, and they just have different approaches,” said two-time Ivy League Player of the Year Kaego Ogbechie ’05, who was one of five Ivy League Rookies of the Year Jennifer has coached. “I think they know their audience. They know people really well and that’s what they feed off one another.”
MORE THAN AN ATHLETE
As the years go by and the wins pile up, nothing is more important to the Weisses than seeing their student-athletes leave Harvard more responsible, caring, and ready to face the real-world challenges ahead of them than when they first arrived as recruits.
“If I’m saying my job is to make you a national champ and [just hope] to God you’re a better man in four years, then I shouldn’t be here,” Jay said.
In the process of what current wrestling captain Cameron Croy described as “making boys into men,” Jay has guided wrestlers to success on the national stage. In his first 20 years as coach, Jay has tutored 19 All-Americans, after the Crimson only had seven in the three quarters of a century prior to his arrival.
But even the best wrestling athletes Harvard has ever seen point to Jay’s teachings, not the wins and championships, as what they carry beyond college.
“There aren’t many coaches in the sport who do as good of a job highlighting the life lessons and the values you can learn through the sport as [Jay] does,” said 2010 NCAA Wrestling National Champion J.P. O’Connor ’10, who returned to Harvard wrestling as an assistant coach after graduation.
A few flights of stairs above the wrestling rooms, Ogbechie dominated Ivy League opponents, registering 1154 kills in an illustrious four-year Crimson volleyball career. Although her impressive accomplishments are written in the Harvard record books, what sticks with her today are the lifelong principles she learned from Jennifer.
“I personally translate [what Jennifer taught me] to everything I do now,” Ogbechie said. “Even with work, [whether it’s] leading a team or being part of a team, it’s critical to have a sense of camaraderie or support…I think she taught us that early on without necessarily even having to say it.”
Likewise, Jennifer’s current players understand the expectations their coach has set out for them.
“Coach [Jennifer] has always cared a lot about us as people and players,” current co-captain Kristen Casey said. “[I’ve learned] from her that success means winning—and sometimes losing—with integrity, unity, and class. That mindset permeates the culture of our team.”
Any Harvard women’s volleyball player that has come through Jennifer’s program has seen how much each individual on the team means to her.
“She has built a program where teammates are more than inclusive, we are a family,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “Coach looks out for us as people and encourages our individual development in addition to helping us grow in our roles on the team…[She] has taught her players that they can conquer anything.”
A GROWING FAMILY
Along with their volleyball and wrestling squads, the Weisses now have their own children to look after. Both sons, Colby and Keegan, have roamed around the Malkin Athletic Center since they could crawl.
Being able to look after the kids at the MAC has not only made life logistically easier for the Weisses, but has taught Harvard players important life lessons, as well.
“When [our boys] come in, they look up to my team and [Jennifer’s] team,” Jay said. “I tell my guys, ‘You’re role models and when my children come into this room, you need to understand that they’re watching you.’ My guys like that. I see a lot of [them] spending time with my kids. I want them to be role models to them.”
To the Harvard athletes, it’s no coincidence that the Weiss’ greatest growth has come with raising their kids.
“I’ve seen their family and how he’s a good father,” Croy said. “He takes those values that he [maintains] as a father and applies them to the wrestling team. I think the Harvard wrestling team is just an extension of his family life and that’s why it’s such a good group.”
On the court a few floors above, Jennifer has altered her approach from the sideline over the years, and her players have taken her words to heart.
“Being a mom has made me a better coach,” Jennifer said. “[I’m] evolving and growing, always learning something every day.”
LEGACY BEYOND ATHLETICS
Two decades of coaching have given both Weisses plenty to reflect on. One thing they are certain of is that it’s not the wins that have kept them in Cambridge for so long.
“The relationships we build are why we come to work every morning and those [relationships are developed] on a daily basis here,” Jay said. “If we’re on the short list of phone calls [for an athlete to say,] ‘Coach, I just got engaged’ or ‘Coach, I just got married’ or ‘Coach, my wife just had a baby,’ that’s pretty cool.”
The time here has also given them a chance to see how their coaching philosophies have evolved to what they are today.
“I think I’m more competitive than ever, but I’m doing it in a different way,” Jay said. “I don’t necessarily want the best wrestler for me, but I want someone who’s going to be great 20 years from now.”
Both the Weisses have seen their fair share of student-athletes come and go. What distinguishes the couple is the number of Harvard graduates that come back to them for help and advice after their college years. Given the way they treat their athletes as family on and off the court and the mats, there’s no surprise that this happens year in and year out.
“You see the same twinkle in their eyes about their players as you do about their children,” Ogbechie said. “I think it’s because they see something in [their players] beyond what anyone else does.”
The personal fulfillment they have gained at Harvard has kept the Weisses grounded, even when other job offers have come up.
“I’ve had opportunities to go other places,” Jennifer said. “We [have] a great thing going and I don’t want to go anywhere…. I think the [mixture of the] quality of life, being able to have a family…and being able to balance it all [is unique]. You can’t do that everywhere.”
With the first 20 plus years in the past, Jay sees no reason to stray from the current course.
“I think it’s pretty evident that we both feel the same way about this place,” he said. “We always say that it’s not a coincidence that I married a person who has the same ideal of making other people’s dreams come true…Now that we’ve been here so long, I can’t see us at another institution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In college basketball, an undefeated regular season is as rare as it gets.
Since the beginning of Division I play, only 24 teams have made it to the tournament with a perfect record, six of which went on to take the national title.
This Sunday, the Harvard men’s basketball team (4-0) will take to the road in pursuit of the elusive dream. Against Colorado (4-1) on Sunday , the Crimson will face its first true test in its quest to become the first undefeated college basketball team since St. Joseph’s in 2004.
If Harvard—picked to finish first in the Ivy League coaches preseason poll—can skate through conference play unscathed, there are only a few teams that could potentially stand in its way. The Buffaloes are one of those teams, with only one blemish on its record so far—a 60-72, season-opening loss to No. 20 Baylor.
In taking on Colorado, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker will encounter a familiar face on the court. Buffaloes junior guard Spencer Dinwiddie narrowed his college choices down to Harvard and Colorado before ultimately choosing Colorado. The guard has thrived in Boulder with 12.4 points per game while shooting .417 from beyond the arc.
The Buffaloes are coming off of four straight decisive victories, including three by more than 20 points. Most recently, Colorado steamrolled Arkansas State in a balanced offensive performance in which four Buffaloes scored in double digits. Sophomore Josh Scott chipped in 20 points—one short of his career high—on 7-for-8 shooting from the paint. The 6’10” forward leads Colorado with 14.6 points and eight rebounds per game.
The Crimson will be hard pressed to contain Scott inside without running into foul trouble. After two players fouled out in Harvard’s season opener against Holy Cross, the Crimson has worked to balance caution early in the game with tenacity down low. Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi has been hampered in his previous two outings, committing four fouls in each.
“I think the way it’s being officiated is going to require an incredible amount of attention to detail,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, following Wednesday night’s 86-68 win over Bryant. “Even the concentration level has to increase. Communication has to be at an all-time premium if you are to trust the help behind you.”
Last season Harvard dealt with a lack of experience in the paint, but with the return of senior Kyle Casey, addition of freshman Zena Edosomwan and development of Moundou-Missi and classmate Jonah Travis, Amaker has a number of options. And all four have shined this season.
Travis opened the season against Holy Cross with a career-high 19-point performance, and Moundou-Missi chipped in a career-high 23 against Bryant. Casey has three double-digit performances and has stepped back into his role as a leader on the court early in the season.
“They definitely complement each other well,” said Saunders of Casey and Moundou-Missi on Wednesday night. “They are both aggressive on the glass and they look to make plays not just for themselves but everybody. It is not just us making plays for them but also them making plays for us.”
But leading them all is a familiar face. Saunders finished last season leading the Ivy League with 16.2 points per game. This season he is back at it with a team-high 17.2 points per game, including a 25-point performance in his most recent outing.
The Crimson would like to see the return of senior guard Brandyn Curry, who has been out since injuring his foot in the season opener. Amaker had hoped for Curry to be ready this week, but the Harvard co-captain wore a walking boot and did not suit up on Wednesday. Amaker said the training staff is taking the injury day by day and had nothing new to report on Wednesday night.
“He’s out indefinitely,” Amaker said. “We’re hopeful for this weekend. We’ll see how things go tomorrow and go from there.”
The Colorado game will be the first of six that Harvard will play on the road before returning to Lavietes Pavillion—including three in the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout over Thanksgiving break. Sunday’s game will be televised on ESPNU, a heretofore-unlucky omen for the Crimson. On Sunday, the team will have a chance to break out of last season’s ESPN curse, which saw Harvard lose three heartbreakers in the final seconds. The Crimson fell with three seconds on the clock at Massachusetts and one second to play at Saint Mary’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hopefully, when Tim Murphy and Buddy Teevens worked together at Maine almost 30 years ago, they listened to a lot of Beatles music together.
In particular, track two from Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.
You see, Teevens is now the head coach at Dartmouth, and this Saturday, Murphy, now the head coach of Harvard, will need a little help from his friend.
Teevens’s squad will be playing Princeton, which sits atop the Ivy League as the lone undefeated team, in the final game of the season. For Harvard, which is in sole possession of second place, a Big Green win coupled with a Crimson victory on Saturday will mean a share of the Ivy League championship.
If Tim Murphy has been checking Twitter update on the Tigers the last two weeks, I can’t blame him. After all, Harvard’s fate lies partially in the hands of Princeton coach Bob Surace.
While Harvard was trashing Columbia, 34-0, Penn was attempting to topple Princeton. But as he tends to do at the end of close games—just ask Coach Murphy—Princeton quarterback Quinn Epperly tossed for a score, and that was the game.
If Murphy needed another downer after watching his team nearly let a 38-0 advantage slip away, all he had to do was pull out his phone last weekend. For just as the Quakers began mounting their own comeback against Harvard, Princeton began pulling away from Yale. Final score: 59-23, Tigers.
Despite how dominant Surace’s team has looked all season, Murphy probably couldn’t ask for a better Ivy team to try to knock off the Tigers. Dartmouth’s only Ivy defeats have come to Harvard and Penn, two close losses to teams that nearly upset Princeton.
Of course, for any of this to matter, Harvard needs to take care of business in New Haven. Sure, the Crimson has won 11 of the last 12 meetings, but Tim Murphy’s boys seem to be a fan of the thriller endings.
In any event, Murphy should send his buddy Buddy a friendly plea for a favor in the form of a well-known Beatles tune. The Crimson will certainly hope that Teevens will recall some nostalgia for the good ol’ Maine days and have Ringo Starr’s voice in his head on Saturday.
But even if Teevens gives the song a listen, will it be enough to knock off the Tigers and give Harvard a share of the title? Read on…
HARVARD (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) at YALE (5-4, 3-3)
This may be the only weekend where the question “We have a football game this weekend?” is not asked at Harvard. Rejoice, Harvard and Yale students who wished they went to a “real” football school—this will be your opportunity to cram into a packed stadium and watch two marching bands do inexplicable things during halftime. Just don’t complain about having to stand—you only do it one game a year (those poor souls at Bama…).
Oh right, the football. Harvard is 8-1, but it hasn’t been playing like an 8-1 team (really? Only 34 points against Columbia?), so I’m going to say that Yale will keep it interesting for a while, but the Crimson will be victorious in the 130th rendition of the Game.
PICK: Harvard 34, Yale 21
CORNELL (2-7, 1-5) at PENN (4-5, 3-3)
Congrats Cornell, you finally won an Ivy game! Oh wait… it was against Columbia. Well, at least David Archer has something to cheer about in his first year as Big Red coach, even if it’s kicking the eternally down Lions even more.
This game will be Jeff Mathews’ last chance to prove to NFL scouts that he is, in fact, a good quarterback. That Cornell leads the league in passing offense, yet is third-to-last in scoring just hammers home how very terrible we can predict the Big Red to be after Mathews does land on an NFL roster next year.
But Mathews remains in Archer’s arsenal for one final game, and against a Penn team that might be demoralized after coming oh, so close to putting together the biggest comeback in Ivy League history, perhaps Cornell will pull off a stunner. But probably not.
PICK: Penn 38, Cornell 17
BROWN (5-4, 2-4) at                COLUMBIA (0-9, 0-6)
The last Columbia team to go 0-10 was the 1987 squad. Lions coach Pete Mangurian, after a 3-7 overall record last year, likely knows that he’s in the hot seat, so maybe this is his way of going out with a bang.
Meanwhile, Brown will most likely be laying with a chip on its shoulder. After downing preseason favorite Penn, 27-0, three weeks ago, the Bears have recorded two straight close losses to Yale and Dartmouth. This team, which once had a feasible shot at the championship, will be playing for some last-minute pride, while its opponent will be playing for… well, whatever it is that Columbia players still have to play for.
PICK: Brown 24, Columbia 3
PRINCETON (8-1, 6-0) at   DARTMOUTH (5-4, 4-2)
Take away the triple-overtime Harvard game and the first contest of the year—a one-point loss to Lehigh—and Princeton has won every game of the season by double digits. Surace’s unusual offensive schemes must work, because the Tigers have an eight-game winning streak.
Princeton is a train with full steam ahead in control of its own destiny, and unfortunately for Harvard’s title chances, I don’t think that Teevens’ boys will be able to handle the Tigers, no matter how many times Murphy calls up his former head coach this week to plead for a win.
PICK: Princeton 52, Dartmouth 31

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team heads into its first non-conference game against Boston University this Friday with high hopes to redeem last year’s 2-1 loss.
In recent matchups between the two squads, the Terriers have come out victorious in three of the last four occassions. However, this year’s contest will likely be competitive, as Harvard (6-1-1, 6-1-1 ECAC) and BU (10-2-1, 6-0-0 Hockey East) are ranked fifth and ninth in the nation, respectively.
“Every game we play with BU is always a great battle and another top-ten competitor, so we’re very excited,” coach Maura Crowell said. “BU is still good, and I think people underestimated them at the beginning [of the season].”
Although the two teams haven’t played each other yet this season, they have gone up against mutual opponents. While the Crimson lost to Rensselaer, 2-1, the Terriers came up with a tie. However, Harvard managed to shutout Union, 3-0, while BU only just scraped out a 3-2 victory.
This year, both teams are adjusting to holes in their rosters, as several players from each squad are preparing for the 2014 Olympic Games. Harvard and BU each have relatively young teams, with seven and five freshmen, respectively.
“There was definitely some adversity heading into the season with our head coach and some key players missing,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “However, there were never any concerns once the season started. Everybody has stepped up and played key roles when called on.”
Sophomore Emerance Maschmeyer has performed well for the Crimson in goal this year, notching 184 saves and a nation-high 95.3 percent saves rate through seven games. But BU goaltender Kerrin Sperry is no slouch; she has tallied 285 saves in 11 games, with a 94.7 percent saves rate.
On the power play, Harvard has proven more efficient than BU, scoring on six of its 30 man-advantages. In contrast, the Terriers have only managed to convert on seven of their 48 chances.
The Crimson has scored an average of 2.75 goals per game as opposed to the Terriers’ 3.2 goal average. However, Harvard’s goal percentage is 11.8 percent compared to BU’s 9.4.
“They have some very potent offensive players and great goaltending, so we’ll just have to pay attention to those guys on the ice,” Crowell said. “These are things we’ve already faced against teams like Clarkson and Cornell, so it’s not different and it’s just another great test and another opportunity to play a great game.”
Out of the 91 total blocks from the Crimson defensive line this season, captain Marissa Gedman has contributed 15. On the offensive side of things, junior defender Sarah Edney and sophomore forward Miye D’Oench have each nabbed three goals and four assists thus far.
Top threats for the Terriers include forwards Louise Warren and Sarah Lefort, who have 13 points apiece. Freshman Maddie Elia leads the team with eight assists, contributing to BU’s rank as the ninth best-scoring offense in the country.
“I know they’re strong in that they have great individuals, but throughout the season we generally try to focus on ourselves,” Crowe said. “We do scouting reports, but ultimately if we play our own game, we’re confident that we can play with anybody.”
Against the Terriers, Harvard will hope to put a halt to a season-long problem—losing momentum late in games.
“I think we just need to be ready to play against the tough competition,” Crowell said. “[We] want to finish [games] the way we start [them]. We need to focus on being consistent, setting the pace, playing our game for 60 minutes, and not [changing] the way we play depending on how the opponent approaches the period.”
BU has been undefeated in conference play thus far this season. However, the Terriers will come into this weekend’s contest fresh off of a 5-0 loss to Wisconsin, while Harvard has yet to see the end to its four-game win streak.
“They’re always a physical team,” Crowell said. “[BU’s conference] plays a little more physically than ECAC teams do sometimes, and BU is definitely one of the teams that does [so].”
Friday’s contest will mark the Crimson’s first non-conference matchup of the year.
“We need to just keep it simple…and we’ll be fine,” Crowe said. “We just continue to grow each and every game as a team, so I’m confident we are going to be ready for BU this weekend.”

With the Game coming up less than a week from now, people are getting ready to go all out and party—unfortunately, that means a boring two hour ride to New Haven. We know that the thought of Yale is repugnant, so immerse yourself in the Harvard bubble for a little longer on the shuttle with a Harvardian film!

Good Will HuntingThe quintessential Harvard film. It's always great to see Ben Affleck, catch him before he becomes Batman, and Matt Damon before The Bourne Identity. Be sure to scream “How you like dem apples?” while reminiscing about the Dunkin’ Donuts on Mass. Ave that will be shut down. Or not. Or moved?
Love StoryOh yes, the annual freshman favorite film about the love between a rich Harvard student and a not so wealthy Radcliffe girl. But seriously, it’s too easy to make fun of this film (can you believe it’s Oscar-nominated?). Despite its cheesiness, it’s still a better love story than anything you can find at Yale.
Legally BlondeIf you’re in the mood for a good laugh, because you won’t find any at Yale, watch the tale of Reese Witherspoon at Harvard Law School. While it is always fun to perform the “Bend and Snap”, please don’t do it while on the way to the Game—it’s a shuttle bus, not a nail salon.
 
The Social NetworkHas anyone from Yale created anything as powerful as Facebook? We didn’t think so. This is because Harvard is the best. Watch it, love it, live it.

On the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy '40, Flyby presents a special collection of news stories from The Crimson's archives. Click on the headlines below to see more of The Crimson's coverage of the assassination and its aftermath, in Dallas and D.C., and at Harvard.
November 22, 1963: Kennedy Assassinated
The President of the United States was shot and killed early this afternoon in Dallas, Texas.
John F. Kennedy '40 was riding in a motorcade with Texas Gov. John Connally when three rifle shots rang out from the large crowd gathered in down-town Dallas.
The President slumped over on the seat of his car, blood pouring from a wound in his right temple. He was rushed to the emergency room of Parkland Hospital, where he died about 2 p.m. (EST). Gov. Connally was also shot and rushed to an emergency operation.
Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the thirty-sixth President of the United States at 2:39 p.m. (EST) on the Presidential plane at Dallas' Love Field. He was preparing to fly to Washington to take office.
November 22, 1963: Death of President Shocks Cambridge
People in Cambridge were finishing lunch when they heard that President John F. Kennedy was shot, and at 2:15 they know that he was dead.
On Massachusetts Avenue groups clustered by car windows to hear the radio. Transistor radios were everywhere. Students greeted each other with "He's dead," and in the restaurants the few diners spoke in low voices.
In Harvard Square of students were standing by the Kiosk, waiting for the extras to begin to arrive. A man in painter's overalls was arguing with a policeman about putting the flag over the Coop at half-meet.
The flags hanging in front of the brick final clubs were all at half-mast, and in Freedom Square a "Poonie told a friend he had just sent someone to buy two flags for the Castle.
November 22, 1963: J.F.K. Graduated Cum Laude, 1940
"Brave officer, able Senator, Son of Harvard; loyal to party, he remains stead-fast to principle." So read the inscription on the honorary Doctor of Laws degree conferred by Harvard on the then junior Senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy '40, at the 1957 Commencement ceremonies.
November 23, 1963: Editorial: President Kennedy
When John Fitzgerald Kennedy took the oath of the President of the United States on a snowy Spring day in 1961, he knew that the long, twilight struggle against tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself would not be finished in the first one hundred days, nor in the first one thousand days, It is not' yet one thousand days since he informed the world of the energy with which he would prosecute that struggle. But his part in it, though incomplete, is tragically done.
The shock of mourning for his brutal death cannot conceal his successes in that struggle. The old men dreamed dreams; the young men had visions. His vivid image of a peaceful revolution of hope animated his most active and effective role in the politics of this hemisphere. Knowing that a free society which cannot help the many who are poor, cannot save the few who are rich, he created the Alliance for Progress and the Peace Corps. He led the way to freer international trade for the United States and a greater economic unity for Europe. And in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, he concluded an historic treaty that remits the slow, agonizing enervation of mankind by the atom, that postpones a little longer man's destruction of himself.
November 23, 1963: President Assassinated in Dallas; University Mourns Kennedy's Death
It was reported from Dallas early this morning that Oswald has been charged by police with the murder of President Kennedy.
The President of the United States was shot and killed early yesterday afternoon in Dallas, Texas.
November 23, 1963: JFK Established Brilliant Record of Gov't Service
The assassination yesterday of President John F. Kennedy ended a brilliant public career. Born May 29, 1917, into a family with deep-rooted political interests, Mr. Kennedy achieved distinction as a naval officer and as a congressman and senator from Massachusetts. He became at 43 the thirty-fifth President of the United States and the youngest man ever elected to the Presidency. He was also the sixth alumnus of Harvard to attain the nation's highest office.
November 23, 1963: Johnson Asks Cabinet Officers, Congressional Leaders for Unity; Tells Nation 'I Will Do My Best'
President Lyndon B. Johnson met briefly in Washington last night with top advisers to the Kennedy Administration, cabinet officers, and Congressional leaders of both parties and asked them all for "unity" in the time of national crisis.
November 23, 1963: Pusey: 'All of Us Are Stunned'
Leaders of the Harvard academic community and friends of the late President expressed grief and shock at yesterday's tragedy. Below are a few of their comments:
President Pusey: All of us are stunned by the death of President Kennedy. It is impossible to estimate what his passing means to our nation and people everywhere. He was one who made wise and effective use of the world of learning and we mourn him as a friend. His only ambition was to serve his country and he gave his life for it.
November 25, 1963: Grieving Nation Mourns Death of Kennedy; University Cancels All Classes for Today
Classes in all branches of the University have been cancelled today. The action, taken in memory of the late President, is unprecedented in Harvard's history.
Following President Lyndon B. Johnson's proclamation of a day of national mourning, Harvard officials announced that none of the University's nine graduate schools or the College would hold classes. Widener, Lamont, and all main libraries will be closed.
The Harvard Yale football game, postponed following the President's assassination, was rescheduled for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in New Haven, but The Game will not be televised. Today's meeting of Harvard's Board of Overseers has been postponed to Dec. 2.
All hour exams scheduled for today have been either postponed or cancelled.

With Harvard-Yale weekend rapidly approaching, students from both universities are gearing up for fun, festivities, and friendly(ish) competition. Although the game is formally billed as the highlight of the weekend, for many of us it really only exists as a nominal excuse for the ensuing drinking, debauchery, reunions with Yale friends and frenemies, and, if you’re me, repeated nostalgic YouTube viewings of Tom Lehrer’s infamous satirical fight song. To keep up morale throughout the weekend, Flyby has come up with a guide to maximizing your celebratory spirit if you choose to imbibe. Whether or not you decide to make alcohol part of your weekend (or most of it), be responsible, enjoy, and stay safe on the mean streets of New Haven.
1. The Crimson Cocktail.
 
Prior to leaving Harvard on Friday, indulge in an afternoon Crimson Cocktail (2 oz gin, ½ oz ruby port, 2 tsp fresh lime juice, 1 tsp grenadine syrup). This could be your last opportunity to enjoy a classy and civilized drink before we are forced to gulp down whatever plebian offerings the barbarians in New Haven are likely to prefer. Extra points if you drink this out of a crystal tumbler with your ring-adorned pinky finger in air while telling everyone how much you love going to Hah-vahd (in a British accent). When things get a little sloppy later that night you’ll want to assure everyone you go to Yale, so for now, revel in your Crimson pride while still on native ground. 
2. The Party Shuttle.
 
Despite the fact that we’re the ones on the road this year, there are several easy ways to let the good times roll along with you. Flyby has an easy solution: bring a flask on the bus. This allows you to simultaneously enjoy the ride and ration your intake due to its pre-allotted portion*. We recommend passing the time with classic road trip games: I Spy, 99 Bottles of Beer, etc. updated with strategic drinking rules.
 
*Although we advocate drinking the way we advocate voting (early and often), there’s a fine line between lively bus drinking games and spending the ride in the bus bathroom vomiting into a plastic bag. Drink safely.
3. Bulldog Gin.
 
When you arrive on Yale’s campus, your first move should be to buy a bottle of Bulldog Gin. Your second should be to promptly pour it out. Bonus points if you do this while cackling gleefully and shouting the Latin lyrics to Harvard’s fight song. If you can’t remember them, just make them up, and if you don’t know Latin, any raucous impressions of the marching band will do. Although we at Flyby decry the waste of any food—or worse, alcohol—ancient Harvard lore dictates that this ritual sacrifice helps ensure a Harvard victory at the Game. (Okay, so Bulldog Gin was actually founded recently, but whatever. I’m trying to make it a thing.)
4. Toad’s.
 
If you haven’t yet figured out the place to be Friday night at Yale, I’ll let you in on the secret now: Toad’s. From the sound of it, Yale really has only one option for socializing together with everyone in a fun and non-exclusive space. I know—lame—right? Harvard has so many non-exclusive social spaces on campus, such as...wait…uh, never mind. Anyway, not being experts on the Yale drinky-drink scene, Flyby can’t offer much in the way of predictions as to what you’ll be imbibing in this foreign territory. We say let your adventures lead you where they will, and if you find yourself in a laundry room late at night, you’ll know what to do. When in New Haven…
5. Water and Beer.
 
Before you crash in whichever Gothic castle—I mean, “residential college”—you find yourself in this weekend, be sure to down a few extra glasses of water since you’ll need to rally bright and early on Saturday. For the game, however, drink suggestions hardly seem necessary. Everyone knows beer and football go together like a Harvard rejection letter and Yale matriculation. As you make your way around the Yale Bowl, you’ll inevitably end up with a beer (or ten), but try to find your preferred tailgate early on before you end up disoriented and reminiscing about the Eisenhower administration with the Harvard Class of 1950 tailgate.
6. The Victory Toast.
 
Amid the post-game chaos and lack of cell phone reception, as you recover your friends and possessions and make your way back to Cambridge, you’ll likely not be enthused at the idea of more alcohol. If you’re feeling well enough, though, be sure to save some brain cells to be consumed by the final drinky-drink of the weekend—a victory toast. Fall asleep on the bus to the sound of popping champagne corks, safe on the northbound I-95 and content in the knowledge that the Game has been won, Thanksgiving approaches, and all is right in the world—at least for the moment.
