With some fresh singles like “I Love It" under their belt, Icona Pop have blitzed the charts in the last year. Prior to their new album, “This is… Icona Pop,” the group built a powerful image as one of the major players in the Top 40 that isn’t afraid to experiment and cross musical borders. In fact, the beauty of Icona Pop lies in the versatility of their music. Their bright tones can fill the dance floor in seconds, but you’ll also see their music in many indie playlists. It’s pop, it’s dance, it’s indie—the world can’t get enough of it. The only problem is, contrary to the bright, fresh feeling of Icona Pop’s first hits, the band’s first full length album doesn’t feel like anything new.
 
Make no mistake, the album is good. It’s just that besides a few shining examples, the songs are relatively interchangeable. “On a Roll” stylistically sounds like a much less inspired version of “I Love It,” for instance. This repetition is not limited to “On a Roll.” It appears again and again throughout the middle section of the album, reaching a nadir on “In the Stars,” which is marked by repetitive, heavy guitar chords that quickly become boring, and a drum synthesizer that feels unusually fake at the slower tempo. 
Each of these songs, individually, are good if not great. Icona Pop’s style, on the whole, is very unique. However, the duo’s musical choices become obvious quickly because they are consistent across this set of songs. The entire album can be summed up in three parts: 1) bright vocals, 2) heavy guitar and synth chords, and 3) intermittent, ecstatic guitar slides. It’s as if the group’s creativity ran dry after they cracked the Icona Pop musical formula and industrialized the process.
 
Certain outliers in the album are its saving grace. Icona Pop, admittedly, do manage to mix things up, continuing to cross into other genres such as hip-hop. With “Light Me Up,” Icona Pop slow things down, opting for a slower, heavy beat. Gone is the clear 4/4 churn. In its place, arpeggiated synths and a funky bass line drive the piece home.
 
Sections like this offer a bit more substance than the middle section of the album. The silly, fun-loving sound of “Then We Kiss” manages to make up for many of the stumbles of the middle songs. The energy and finality of it make it more than decent punctuation for the end of the album. The faster tempo, along with the bouncy synth motif heard throughout, is refreshing and uplifting. The stunning track managed to improve the album as a whole—no easy task.
 
Besides that, the album’s earlier songs steal the show—namely “Girlfriend,” “We Got the World,” and “I Love It.” In these tracks, the classic Icona Pop sound is at its best—engaging and bright without feeling hackneyed. These singles are the heart of the album. “Girlfriend,” a previously released single, takes the risk of lightening up on the chords for an airier feel, and it pays off, as the punchier climaxes are all the more exciting. But nothing compares to Icona Pop’s signature single “I Love It.”  The bass drives the music, and it does so wonderfully. Its subtle yet driving buzz keeps things bright and balances well with the hi-hat beat and vocals.
 
Icona Pop are not unoriginal, and their sound still appeals most of the time. Unfortunately, “This is… Icona Pop” drags throughout the repetitive middle of the album. This leaves me wondering what else the powerhouse indie pop group can offer us if they stay devoted to their niche. The self-consciously fresh and sparkling nature of their sound practically requires them to keep their future releases sounding new and surprising. It’s a challenging requirement, and, if they fail to meet it with future releases, Icona Pop risks fading away entirely.

Though Haim’s 2012 EP “Forever” garnered the Los Angeles band comparisons to Fleetwood Mac, their debut album, “Days Are Gone,” places the trio of sisters somewhere on the spectrum between riot grrrl and Spice Girls—half punk, half pop, and wholly rooted in the feminist sensibilities of the 1990s. Drawing influences from genres ranging from 1980s glam and synthpop to modern pop and R&B, Haim manage to escape the homogeneity that dominates so much of the indie music scene today, by crafting a sound that is as unique as it is appealing.
Haim are frequently described as having a retro sound, but “Days Are Gone” presents a much more forward thinking image of the band than their earlier EPs indicated. For all the ’70s and ’80s influences that float on the surface of previously released  songs like “Forever” and “Falling,” the tracks on “Days Are Gone” are characterized not by the sparkling synths, booming drums, and thudding bass that give the songs their throwback feel, but by the perfectly crafted pop hooks that lie beneath the veneer. Sans shimmery production and based on melodic and harmonic structure alone, “Go Slow” could as easily have been sung by Kelly Clarkson as by the Haim sisters, while “The Wire,” with its crisp finger snaps and neat harmonies, would not sound out of place on a Top 40 radio station.
The three opening tracks of “Days Are Gone” have all been released previously as singles, and placing the trio at the fore of the album is a gutsy move on Haim’s part. But the rest of the album exceeds expectations as Haim move away from classic pop structure to more experimental material—“Running If You Call My Name” and “Days Are Gone” are both reminiscent of “Oracular Spectacular”-era MGMT, layered over dreamy, drug-hazed backgrounds. Haim make its biggest gamble with “My Song 5,” which begins with a brassy, hair metal-esque guitar riff and evolves into what is undoubtedly the most innovative track on the album: breathy, R&B-tinged vocals over a dark main melody with a dull, synthesized buzz below. There is something sexy about the track, something appealing in the gritty guitar, the funky syncopation, the high-pitched vocals. The track possesses the same je ne sais quoi that catapulted the previously unknown Muse’s “Supermassive Black Hole” to the top of the charts seven years ago. With “My Song 5,” Haim push at the boundaries of both retro and indie, and in doing so, creates music that for all its strangeness is as catchy as any pop song.
  The album’s sole flaw is a slight lull around the 15-minute mark, with “If I Could Change Your Mind” and “Honey & I.” Both are sweet, well-crafted tracks—they simply lack the brashness and earworm choruses that one comes to expect from Haim. That they could even be considered weaknesses is a testament to the band’s songwriting abilities and to the caliber of the rest of the album.
The Haim sisters may not be avowed feminists, but their lyrics have all the trappings of the “girl power” musical groups so prevalent two decades before. Songs like “Don’t Save Me” feature lines like “If your love isn’t strong / Baby, don’t save me,” while the oddball “My Song 5” is even more straightforward: “I am not your honey pie,” the sisters assert. In “Falling,” they croon, “no one’s ever enough”;  “Running If You Call My Name” bluntly proclaims, “I run away if you call my name.” Their assertions of female independence have rendered Haim strikingly popular among young women in the indie music scene, and it is not hard to believe that as their fame grows, so will their status as the feminist poster children du jour.
  Each track on “Days Are Gone” ends surprisingly abruptly. The decision is a successful one, as it is difficult not to want more after each song concludes. “Days Are Gone” is, from start to finish, a stellar work, as Haim combine the strengths of the 1970s, 1990s, and 2010s into a solid debut album that hopefully prophecies even better music to come.

It was last Monday evening at the Harvard Book Store and autumn was fast approaching. Novelist Virginia Pye was dressed in a bright orange scarf, and a crowd of 50-year-olds settled in for story time as the writer told of a foreign place and a distant past. When technology failed the audience watched her slide show from a small 15-inch laptop, enraptured not by the wonders of the modern age, but rather by the magic of the era that her story sought to conjure for them.
 
Set in China in 1910, Pye’s “River of Dust” describes an unusual adventure inspired by one taken by Pye’s own grandfather. In the novel, a missionary couple goes to China to spread the word of God, but they quickly find themselves in unexpected danger when their son is kidnapped. The father scours the country for his son while his pregnant wife remains at the mission compound. As Pye described it, the novel deals with “American hubris and the dangers of colonialism.”
 
Pye explained to the audience that, under slightly different circumstances than “River of Dust,” her own grandfather was sent to China to shut down a mission that had been established in a dangerous location. He controversially decided to expand the mission’s presence instead. He then went on to settle down with his wife in China before he died of tuberculosis. The novel’s direct connection to Pye’s life comes, then, from the fact that her father was raised in China and that a feeling of loss permeated his childhood, just as it does for the kidnapped character. The novel is a clear attempt to reconnect with her family’s complicated past.
 
This guiding theme of family seemed to carry Pye’s voice for 10 minutes as she read of the father’s quest to reclaim his son in a foreign land. Though the China she wrote of is long gone, the struggles of a family to stay together are relevant in any age. It may be Pye’s focus on this theme, indeed, that has finally helped her achieve literary success; she wrote six unpublished novels before “River of Dust.” When asked to comment on this, Pye said with a kindly smile, “I am delighted. I am very, very happy that this is my first book.” Although she does not know how Chinese readers might react to her novel, she is in the process of obtaining the rights to sell her novel there.
 
Pye further explained how she came to be inspired by her family’s unique adventures. Though she has never actually been to mainland China, her parents immersed her in Chinese culture from a young age. Her father, an avid scholar of China, brought many pieces of Chinese art into their home, as well as frequent Chinese friends and visitors. While recently cleaning out her parent’s house, Pye read her grandfather’s journals from his travels in China, which allowed her “to understand the language of that time.” Though herself an anti-colonial pacifist, with time, Pye said, she came to appreciate these intriguing aspects of her family’s heritage. Her simple curiosity about her grandfather’s journals eventually lead her to use her fiction to find “an interesting way to carry on a family story.” Through her writing, Pye has now transformed what were once her grandfather’s unique tales into her own creative take on a particular piece of Chinese history.

Global Arts Corps’s “Hold Your Tongue; Hold Your Dead,” which ran through September 28 and was put on by ArtsEmerson The World on a Stage, isn’t a satisfying play. Then again, it isn’t intended to be; this play aims to convey hard, unresolved truths. “Hold Your Tongue” follows the lives of two intersecting families as they struggle to find happiness, or any sort of resolution, in post-conflict Northern Ireland. The script and actors treated their material with a sincerity that allowed the overall atmosphere of the culture to pervade the production.
From the outset of the show, each scene felt grounded in the traditions of Irish culture while also exposing a foreboding disturbance. “Hold Your Tongue” began with the ensemble cast arranged in a circle of black chairs, with one member—Nevin (Ryan McParland)—standing apart, hiding his face on one of the stark set’s many black boxes. The characters took turns singing segments of Irish songs, ranging from Yeats’s “Down by the Sally Gardens” to the traditional “Here’s a Health to the Company.” Each singer was cut short mid-line by silence.
The fathers of both families, Colin (Alan McKee) and Rory (Vincent Higgins), drive the emotional conflict of “Hold Your Tongue.” McKee turned in a solid performance as Nevin’s Protestant “pacifist” father, scarred by the Troubles of the late 20th century. Nevin and Colin speak regularly, but rarely get through to each other. Shortly before Nevin takes his own life, he works with his father to assemble a power tool. As they finish the job, Nevin attempts to tell him of his lover Kerry (Eileen O’Higgins) and her pregnancy, but Colin simply laughs over the roar of the new tool and walks offstage.
Higgins’s Rory is a jaded tour guide, an Irish Catholic who compulsively mixes lies and harsh truths into his tours. After informing his tour bus that Leonardo DiCaprio was “born in Belfast,” he uses the same deadpan delivery to point out the Belfast city graveyard, which has the unique distinction of being cut in half by an underground wall to separate the Protestant and Catholic dead. Higgins was often caught speaking directly to the audience about the situation in Ireland; he stands at the back of his tour bus with a megaphone pointing outwards. In a remarkable scene, Rory speaks of the rising suicide rate in Ireland, one that has almost doubled “since peace broke out.”
Perhaps the most poignant aspect of the play is its depiction of its female characters as marginalized in present-day Ireland. While each female character has an influential role in the plot of the work, by the end of the show all have been rendered virtually powerless. Nevin’s mother, Nicola (Julia Dearden), is reduced to unintelligible babbling about household chores and groceries. Alice (Eileen Pollock) crawls into her bed in a drunken stupor, muttering one of the unwritten laws of Northern Ireland’s contemporary cultural landscape: “hold your tongue, hold your dead,” signifying the society’s reluctance to talk about past political violence and strife.
Kerry, the young woman with whom Nevin has made plans to raise a family, has the worst fate of the bunch. A victim of Nevin’s swinging moods and emotional emptiness, she seems powerless to do anything but watch as he slowly descends to his fate. This powerlessness isn’t a result of inaction; O’Higgins conveyed an urgency in Kerry that was immediate and relatable. She frequently voices her worry—appealing to Nevin, her father, anyone—but it is of no use, as both men have surrounded themselves with the emotional wasteland in which they live.
There was little melodrama in McParland’s performance—Nevin does not overstate his suffering, or even directly address it. In his climactic scene, loosely fastening a tie around his neck in a way more reminiscent of a noose than a tie, McParland simply repeated the word “useless” until the word itself became devoid of meaning and, well, useless. He was reduced to nonsensically muttering the word and inhaling sharply, as if gasping for breath.
Nevin’s suicide is the peak of the story, but its emotional climax comes earlier, when both fathers meet for the first time. Religious tensions were tacit yet palpable, but the two manage to establish an uneasy camaraderie as they hop from pub to pub one night. The peace topples, though, when a hint of an argument surfaces. A harmless argument about a folk tale amplifies until Rory explodes with anger, giving a seething rant against a Protestant celebration. The silence after this eruption speaks volumes, again pointing out the disjointed relationship between citizens on either side of the conflict.
In this way, “Hold Your Tongue” rarely confronted the issues of post-conflict Ireland head-on—and the show as a whole was better for its subtlety. Those issues were clearly reflected in the lives of its characters. Here and there, a profound sadness broke through with remarkable incisiveness. Throughout the production the conflict stayed entrenched, unmoving. Both sides remain at a hostile distance, illustrating what Alice mutters, drifting off to sleep: “you throw a stone, we throw a stone, all the way back.”

In 1929, beleaguered by increasingly negative criticism of his new work’s latest serialized chapters, James Joyce approached a friend about the prospect of taking the seemingly doomed project off his hands. It was a bailout that never came to fruition, however, as Joyce eventually rallied against his critics to complete “Finnegans Wake,” his final novel. Yet now, 74 years on from its publication, “Finnegans Wake” is, if less maligned, not much more understood. Or read, for that matter—the book’s reputation as an impenetrable thicket of allusions and nonsense words leaves few willing to hack their way through the entire thing. Daniel W. Erickson ’14, writer, actor, and director of “Here Comes Everybody,” hoped to change that with his one-man production. The piece, which ran at the Adams Pool Theatre through September 28 was Erickson’s attempt to render a colossus of world literature approachable. What was intended to be a conversational manner, however, came off as forced and glib, largely obscuring what was meant to be an intimate and personal work.
  
Erickson’s project—“play” isn’t the right word—set out to convince the audience of the merits of picking up a novel that is often considered more or less incomprehensible, and his work was a mélange of singing, musings, music, and literary criticism. Indeed, his analysis of “Finnegans Wake” was one of the most successful parts of the production: even the two unassuming words of the title are packed with typically Joycean wordplay, and Erickson did a good job of teasing out all the layers of meaning. At the same time, though, much of Erickson’s commentary was predicated on the assumption that viewers know nothing about the novel or the sources from which it draws its many allusions—those who do may find a good bit of it redundant.
  
The largest problem with “Here Comes Everybody,” however, was that it never managed to disappear into itself; it always persisted in feeling like a performance, and not a great one at that. Erickson strove for a casual air but rarely managed to carry it off—the grinning, “I-know-this-is-a-joke” look with which he delivered so many of his lines deadened any humor in the words, as did the frantic manner he often resorted to in an attempt to play up his jokes. The humor in Joyce’s lines was perfectly able to hold its own without the forced laughter Erickson interspersed throughout his reading. There is nothing less funny than trying to be funny. While some of Erickson’s lines do indeed contain a glimmer of wit, his speaking style detracted and distracted from both his jokes and his serious analysis.
  
This is not to say, however, that there were not moments of the production that were closer to the bone. The traditional Irish music that Erickson and musicians Ryan A. Murphy ’14 and Christian N. Fohrby ’14 included throughout the piece was a smart choice—Erickson’s voice has a simple, winsome charm, and inviting the audience to join in created a genuine atmosphere of bonhomie that Erickson tried and failed to capture elsewhere. Another high point occurred at the end of the first act, where Erickson recounted how Joyce’s work resonated with his own existential journey. Here, Erickson dropped his comic schtick, delivering the only truly personal moment of the evening and injecting his monologue with a much-needed sense of sincerity. Yet even this was undercut by the fact that Erickson made extensive use of his notes, reading from the page instead of speaking genuinely. There was the kernel of a good idea here—Erickson would have done well to bring the scene’s emotional oomph to other parts of this work.
Drop the clowning, drop the unnecessary Irish accent, and Erickson would have a project that succeeded in its goal—his love of Joyce’s book was infectious and clearly unfeigned. The problem was that so much of the piece was delivered in so unpalatable a manner. Erickson was at his best when forgetting the theatrics, letting his guard down and singing happily, giving himself over to the music of Joyce’s language, or entreating the audience as they left to simply “read this damned book.”

Last Tuesday, The Crimson featured an article about a beloved member of the class of 2012 who lost her life in a car accident last week. The news was—and still is—shocking, to those who knew her as well as to those who didn’t. It is a tragedy. She was so young. She had so much life to live.
When my roommate asked me Sunday night, “Did you know…?” I didn’t respond immediately. Her question had said it all. And though she and I had only shared a working relationship and I had not spoken to her in months, her absence suddenly filled the room. I hesitated for a good five seconds before responding to the question that had been left dangling in the air. It is those pivotal moments between the knowledge of oncoming bad news, and the bad news, in which we wish we could suspend ourselves indefinitely. “Yes. Why?”
You don’t need to hear it from me that she was an absolutely incredible human being. Ask any one of her friends, fellow Lowell residents, professors; anyone she ever worked with or worked for—she touched the lives of so many people of all ages and communities on campus, which was also made apparent at the memorial service held in her memory last week. It was as if each person who spoke was thanking her for something she had done or said, or for a certain unique aspect of her personality. Harvard was undoubtedly a brighter place when she was here. I hope to God she knew that.
If we think realistically about our total daily interactions in college, a majority of them perhaps are not with our closest friends or family, but with acquaintances—people we know semi-well, whose company we might enjoy, but whom we might not otherwise seek out for more intense conversation. These are people on the outer strands of the social web we envision when we plop ourselves in the very center. Generally our contact with them is confined to a particular context like a dorm or a club. They are our periphery people. And though social interactions with our periphery people might comprise a large percentage of our total daily social interactions, we subconsciously tune them out when reflecting upon our day because our brain considers them less important. Think about all the times we hold a door open for that dorm mate we always see; find a comment that somebody made in section particularly intriguing; exchange hellos with a passing Annenberg friend from freshman year; ask a professor a question in lecture; small chat with somebody while we both wait for our bagels to toast. All the “Hey, how are you?”s, the email exchanges with leaders of other clubs, the short conversations with a peer leaving the same class. Our lives are filled with people on the periphery, and we don’t even realize the profound impact that these small but powerful connections with others have on our lives.
Our periphery people keep our web stable and grounded. They are our source of comfort in scary social situations. They make us feel like we are a part of something larger—like an integral piece of a community. They reassure us that we belong. They are often people we genuinely like, respect, even at times admire from afar or aspire to emulate—as was the case for me.
I am confident that she knew what she meant to her close friends. Not a doubt in my mind. But the reason I say that I hope she knows what she meant to this campus is because we don’t appreciate our periphery people enough. We don’t recognize, as individuals, how our lives are influenced on a daily basis by the small interactions with people we probably never give a second thought about. Even more rarely do we outwardly acknowledge our appreciation for one of our periphery people. That should change.
I wish we didn’t need tragedies to realize how lucky we are. It saddens me that it took the passing of an inspirational person in my periphery to realize how much those people really mean to me. From now on I promise to recognize consciously the ways in which my periphery people are impacting my life. Even more important, I will strive to make them aware of how much I respect and appreciate them. If everybody does the same, I know that the Harvard web will become that much more taut.

When you heard the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision to remove a piece of the Voting Rights Act, you may have been surprised. But the most mathematically minded Americans should have been surprised for an entirely different reason—the decision did not come down 9-0. The justices are all intelligent and heard the same facts, so how did they not reach the same conclusion?
This seems patently absurd. Anyone passively familiar with the court knows we receive 5-4 decisions all the time, and every one of us has long-standing political disagreements with friends we consider to be rational-minded. Disagreement is the lifeblood of intellectual debate.
Enter the mathematicians. Robert Aumann, a Nobel laureate with a Gandalf beard and a genial grin, has spent most of his career studying knot theory and correlated equilibrium in non-cooperative games. But in 1976, he published a brief, three-page paper called “Agreeing to Disagree,” which has gradually become his most-cited work. In it he proves what is now known as Aumann’s agreement theorem: Two rational people with the same information can’t disagree.
In what may seem like a coy bit of self-reference, you cannot disagree with this theorem. It is derived from incontrovertible axioms using sound steps of logic. If you take issue with it, you must also take issue with the core tenets of mathematics.
The argument leading to this conclusion is so simple that Aumann all but apologizes for publishing it. “Once one has the appropriate framework,” he writes, “it is mathematically trivial.” He proceeds to break down the statement into mathematical formalisms, but his reasoning can be likened to a young child who has just learned the power of the question, “Why?”
For example: “I believe New York is safer now than it was in 1980.” “Why?” “The murder rate is lower now, and lower murder rates make a city safer.” “Why is your first statement true?” “There were 2,228 murders in 1980, and 414 murders in 2012, and 414 is a lower murder rate than 2,228.” “Why are your first two statement true?” “The New York Times reports those numbers, and what the New York Times reports is generally true.” “Why is your second statement true?” And so forth.
To disagree with a conclusion, you must disagree with an assumption, which can be broken up into more basic assumptions. This process continues until you reach an unbreakable atom of information, and we assumed everyone has the same information.
Aumann’s theorem, you will not be shocked to hear, does not translate well from paper to podium. Politics cannot be atomized as easily as mathematics, so the notion of two people truly having the “same information” is an approximation at best. And more importantly, people are not rational in the way theorists imagine they are—we like our current beliefs, and we will shape new information in light of them. And we really don’t like being wrong.
Imagine the blowback if, mid-debate, Romney had conceded that perhaps he ought to read up a bit on military spending cuts before criticizing Obama’s actions. Imagine the ridicule if, after reading enough op-eds , the president announced his conclusion that perhaps Obamacare wasn’t such a good idea after all and endorsed the motion toward its repeal. These scenarios are comically unthinkable, and yet they would be the norm if the world were inhabited by the rational beings we read about in economics textbooks.
The tenured justices of the Supreme Court may do better than most to seek honest results, but their 5-4 disagreements, often along partisan lines, betray their inability to distance themselves from the culture of political adversarialism. Fortunately, we needn’t let the improprieties of public discourse infect the halls of academia. My hope is that, knowing rational disagreement is impossible, you may temper your convictions and actively attempt to be convinced. There are smart people who disagree with you—if an omniscient referee were called in, would you bet your beliefs?
The aforementioned ruling on the Voting Rights Act has led to new voter ID laws, which are presently being both hailed as commonsense and censured for racism. Today, make an effort to discard your preexisting conviction. Do some research and gather relevant information. Build a modest conclusion built directly from obvious assumptions. Submit to peer review by finding a friend who takes issue with your verdict. Have her identify the assumption with which she disagrees, and break it down further.
You will undoubtedly find it difficult to defend claims you thought were safe. As you struggle, do your best to remember Aumann’s gospel: You don’t win a debate when your opponent is convinced; you win a debate when all parties reach the truth.

Sixty-five years ago Harvard wasn’t too big on diversity.  A stereotypical Harvard College class at that time would have been white, male, and wealthy. In 1950, the Harvard freshman class included only four black students. Women weren’t issued Harvard degrees until 1963, and admissions did not become need-blind until the late 1950s. Today, a typical Harvard class presents a vastly different picture. The class of 2017 contained only slightly more men than women, the class of 2015 contained record numbers of minority students, and almost 60 percent of Harvard students receive some form of need-based financial aid. When seen in this light present day Harvard not only seems to severely contrast the Harvard of yesteryear, but also appears to be a model of diversity for others to emulate.
However, one must question if these numerical indicators span all types of diversity. For though undergraduates hail from all regions of the country in roughly similar numbers, geographic diversity is lacking and in some cases blatantly disregarded by the student population. As a student population we embrace the utopia that Harvard creates, allowing us to connect with students from vastly different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. We sing praises about a culture that encourages us to learn more about and befriend those of different sexual orientations, different views, and different experiences from our own. On our campus, singling someone out or even worse insulting someone because they are a minority, from a low-income family, of a different religion from your own, or part of the BGLTQ community is completely socially unacceptable, and so it should be.
Why, then, when I introduce myself as being from West Virginia, does it become okay to ask if I have shoes and teeth or, worse, say that you feel sorry for me? It would never occur to the vast majority of our college to insult or put down someone’s sexuality, race, or ethnicity, so why is geography different? It’s different because although in the past 65 years Harvard students have for the most part abandoned their belief that being white, male, and wealthy is more desirable than being of color, female, or poor, we have not yet abandoned our belief that being from the Northeast, the West Coast, or from a city is far superior than hailing from a so-called flyover state. Not only is it generally socially acceptable to put down my home state and much of the South and Midwest, there is also a perception that I should agree with you.
The problem is I don’t agree with you. Just ask me about my state. I could tell you that less than 15 percent of high school freshman in my state will go on to any form of higher education, and I went to school with students who lacked running water and had dirt floors in their homes. I could tell you that in some counties in West Virginia over half of children live below the poverty line and that the per capita income is under $11,000. Then maybe you’d understand why the jabs you make about shoes and teeth aren’t funny. They may not apply to me, but they strike way too close to home. On the other hand, I could also tell you about how incredible West Virginia is. I could tell you about what it’s like to stand at the top of a mountain in the fall and see an entire valley of trees that seem to be on fire with reds and gold as the sun sets behind them. I could tell you what it’s like to sing “Country Roads” with 60,000 people in the West Virginia University football stadium and know that the entire state is watching their televisions and singing too. I could tell you about what it feels like for your entire town to celebrate your admission to Harvard. Most of all, though, I could tell you about my home and how it’s made me who I am.
And that’s the key. This isn’t about West Virginia – it’s about you and me. Part of my identity has been formed from growing up in West Virginia, and when you write my home state off before knowing anything about it, you write part of me off as well. Yes, that part of me is vastly different from you, but we are all vastly different from each other and that’s what makes Harvard special. Our geographic backgrounds are just another piece of the puzzle of diversity that creates Harvard.
However, when we continue to assume that the lifestyles of certain places are better than the lifestyles of other places, the puzzle remains incomplete. With that, I challenge you. The next time you want to make a hillbilly joke or just make an assumption about a place you’ve never been to, realize your ignorance. Instead of assuming, or worse, judging—ask. Ask the less than two-tenths of one percent of Harvard students from West Virginia about growing up there. Ask the two Harvard students who hail from Wyoming about their state. Ask those students who come from small towns and small high schools across the country what makes their home special. Then maybe we as a community can move forward, begin to abandon our geographical stereotypes and falsehoods, and form a stronger and more diverse Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is nothing like a brisk morning walk from the Radcliffe Quadrangle to a meeting in Harvard Yard on a frigid winter weekend. And until this past Saturday, there was no alternative either.
In 2009, Harvard eliminated weekend morning service from its shuttle scheduling, leaving Quadlings who wished to travel to games, practice, meetings, rehearsals, and more on the river before noon with no choice but to trek toward Harvard Square by foot. That all changed at 8 a.m. on September 28, when the first weekend morning shuttle in four years pulled up in front of Currier House to bear bleary-eyed Harvardians to wherever they were needed so early in the day.
The new extended schedule resulted from what Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich called “great collaboration” between the Undergraduate Council, the Office of Student Life, and Harvard’s transportation fleet. We could not agree more. The revised shuttle schedule showcases the UC’s ability to deliver the kind of bread-and-butter services that improve Harvard students’ lives in concrete and lasting ways. We hope to see future efforts like this one, especially in the area of shuttle service improvement.
Though we have voiced our doubts as to the UC’s ability to effect substantial change at Harvard, we hail the revised shuttle schedule as an example of the council’s ability to use the power it does wield to the student body’s benefit. Perhaps the UC cannot transform the quality of Annenberg cuisine or hammer out all the kinks in Harvard’s mental health system. But it can solicit student opinion to ascertain what smaller alterations will make a big difference, and that is exactly what has occurred here.
Though we are thankful that students can now get to and from Johnston Gate on a Saturday morning just as easily on Harvard’s Crimson Cruiser as they can on Wellesley’s “Senate Bus,” we would like to see the UC follow up on this successful project with more initiatives to enhance and expand shuttle service. For instance, shuttles often run out of sync with their posted schedules. What’s more, a missed shuttle means a 25-minute wait for the next ride or a solitary walk through Cambridge Common in the dark of the night. More reliable and frequent service would go a long way toward ensuring convenience and safety for shuttling students.
The UC has demonstrated its commitment to advancing students’ interests as well its capacity to carry out certain goals. With luck, it will continue to pursue ends it has the means to achieve and, in doing so, help make Harvard the best it can be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A leader of a secular organization at Harvard was fired last week after admitting that she falsified the credentials she presented to the group, according to a story in The New York Times.
Teresa MacBain claimed to the Humanist Community at Harvard (HCH) and in press coverage—including a profile by The New York Times—that she received her divinity degree from Duke University. But after the Times published the profile, the newspaper said that the director of communications at the Duke Divinity School, Audrey P. Ward, contacted the Times stating that the school had no record of MacBain having attended or earned a degree.
MacBain acknowledged in a telephone interview with the Times that the information from Ward was correct, but did not provide any further explanation as to why she chose to falsify her credentials, according to the paper.
MacBain was hired in August to lead the Harvard branch of the Humanist Community Project—a nationwide initiative that seeks to expand the humanist community—a year after the former Methodist minister came into the spotlight for declaring that she no longer believed in God.
Greg M. Epstein, the chaplain for HCH, released a statement on Sept. 26 that said that MacBain would no longer be working for the independent organization.
“We at HCH have approached this situation as best we can, striving to apply our reason in the service of both fairness and compassion,” he said, noting that the search for a new director would begin soon.
In a tweet, Epstein redirected inquiries from The Crimson to this public announcement.
Epstein expressed regret at his organization’s failure to verify MacBain’s credentials in an emailed statement to the Times.
“Clearly we should have verified Teresa’s M.Div degree rather than relying upon her resume and the frequent, public references to it as she worked for and with several Freethought organizations,” Epstein wrote.
Sarah E. Coughlon ’15, an active member of Harvard’s humanist community and former vice president for the undergraduate community of humanists, atheists, and agnostics, commented on the impact of the discovery.
“It will be a setback for them opening that new community center,” Coughlon said, referring to one of the endeavors MacBain was set to pursue. “But I doubt that it will have any kind of terrible, long-term implications for the world.”
Chelsea S. Link ’12, a former campus organizing fellow for HCH, said she thought the recent events would have a negative impact on the group. Link added that the event was particularly unfortunate given the impact it might have on the organization’s credibility.
“I’m not going to lie. I’m a little bit embarrassed to have it on my resume now,” Link said. “I’m worried that if anyone has heard of this organization, it would be in The New York Times associated with the falsification of credentials.”
However, Link said that she thought that the organization would recover.
“I’m totally confident that they’ll bounce back from this,” she said.
MacBain and Ward could not be reached for comment.

Harvard students basked in the fragrance of freshly-baked cider doughnuts and roamed through rows of crops with produce that will later be served in Harvard dining halls during an excursion to the Wilson Farm on Friday.
Organized by the Food Literacy Project, the trip provided students the opportunity to tour the farm of one of Harvard University Dining Services’ local partners and learn about their growing practices.
Wilson Farm, a family-run operation dating back to the 1800s, provides HUDS with 40,000 pounds of carrots a year.
The tour was led by Wilson Farm employee Heather Aveson, who said that a lot of people who visit the farm are concerned about “organic products.”
“Personally, I would rather know where my food comes from,” Aveson said. “It’s all about the chain of custody.”
Aveson traced the process the produce goes through at the farm—from beginning as seeds in the soil to being picked, washed, and refrigerated before being sold on the stand.
“It’s important to me because I wouldn’t want to feed my family anything I don’t feel good about,” Aveson said.
The tour concluded at the farm stand, where students shopped the Wilson’s selection of produce, cheeses, and other farm-fresh offerings. Students ate from boxes of Wilson’s signature cider doughnuts during the shuttle ride back to campus.
But the allure of fresh doughnuts was not the only reason some students decided to venture out to the farm. Yuan Jiang ’16 said she thought the tour would help her de-stress from a long week.
Rhema Hokama, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said her vegan lifestyle inspired her to learn more about local farming practices.
Louisa C. Denison ’11, coordinator for the Food Literacy Project, said that the model of partnering with local farms is not a new practice for HUDS. In 2008, HUDS created a unique partnership with Ward’s Berry Farm in Sharon, Mass., in which HUDS would buy all the squash grown on a quarter of an acre planted specifically for them, according to Denison.
“This program has worked very well over the past five years, the result being that Harvard students enjoy a great variety of local squash on the dining menu,” Denison wrote in an email to The Crimson.
According to Crista Martin, the HUDS director for marketing and communications, HUDS serves 25,000 meals a day and requires 700 pounds of vegetables just for one dinner for undergraduates.
“Not many farms can devote space to that kind of volume,” Martin said. “So we go to larger farms and say, ‘In this year, we are likely to use this many pounds of this vegetable. Can you grow it for us?’”
Peter Szigeti, a student at Harvard Law School who said he is interested in the intersection of food and property law, said he thought the trip provided a good educational opportunity.
“I also thought it was cheap, fun, and that there would be good food,” Szigeti said.

Undergraduate Council representatives passed a $489,000 budget for the 2013-2014 school year as discussion about UC finances dominated the first general meeting of the fall semester on Sunday.
The Council budget, which draws the bulk of its funds from a $75 fee term-billed to all Harvard College students, decreased by 7.9 percent from last year due to a policy change made by the UC last semester to ensure that all funds received in a single school year are used that year and not rolled over into the next year. Historically, the UC has relied on this “roll-over funding” as part of its budget.
“The…overriding philosophy that we adopted in the last year is that we want to spend all the money that we get from the term bill in a given academic year in that same academic year,” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said at the meeting.
The largest portion of the budget—66.5 percent—is given out as grants to student group activities. Almost 30 percent is allocated to the House Committees of the 12 residential Houses and Dudley House, and two percent is set aside for funding individual student initiatives. The remaining $8,000 is being used as the operations fund for the Council.
Before voting on the budget, new and returning representatives asked questions and held a preliminary discussion on ideas to reform the budget, a priority for this semester, according to Raghuveer.
Several representatives suggested looking into modifying the $146,000 in funding given to the 12 Houses and Dudley.
Representatives pointed out that although each residential House is allotted the same amount of funding from the UC, some Houses had other funding sources for their respective House Committees, resulting in significant discrepancies in the budgets of various Houses.
Student Initiatives Chair and Kirkland House representative Barr Yaron ’14 suggested representatives look into how Yale College funds each of its residential dorms, in which each “college” operates on the same budget, even accounting for outside funding.
Responding to a question about a UC proposal to double the term-bill fee, Raghuveer and UC Treasurer and Mather House representative Jonathan Y. Li ’14 told representatives that the status of that proposal was in limbo after Evelynn M. Hammonds resigned from her position as dean of the College earlier this year.
“[The term-bill increase] was something we put on Dean Hammonds’ desk and with the change that happened, we’re going to have to make sure [interim] Dean [of the College Donald H.] Pfister is on board,” said Li.

The familiar voice of Meredith Vieira, an NBC correspondent and former co-host of the popular news program “Today,” rang close to home Saturday afternoon as she commenced the first annual Harvard Alzheimer’s Symposium.
Organized by Harvard College Alzheimer’s Buddies, the Symposium attracted a range of speakers to promote greater collaboration and dialogue amongst those impacted by the disease, according to the group’s website.
“The Harvard Alzheimer’s Symposium is not just an effort to raise awareness, but also an effort to turn that awareness into active contribution in the fight against Alzheimer’s Disease,” Vieira said.
According to Harvard Medical School professor Ruth Kandel, Alzheimer’s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., affecting about 5.4 million Americans, or one in nine elderly people.
Speakers at the event discussed methods that could potentially reduce the severity of the disease. Brendon P. Boot, neurology instructor at the Medical School, suggested using PET scans to detect Alzheimer’s 30 years before the disease actually manifests, which he said might lead to earlier diagnoses and lessen memory loss.
Another speaker, Michael Ellenbogen, shared his personal experience living with Alzheimer’s.
“Today it has become more challenging,” Ellenbogen said. “There is so much I want to do, but I realize I cannot do it.”
Ellenbogen called for greater awareness and support for Alzheimer’s patients.
“We must first change the mindset of how people view this disease,” he said. “There are no survivors.”
James Creasey, the founder of Jiminy Wicket, an international organization that raises awareness of dementia through the game of croquet, said long-term Alzheimer’s patients, 66 percent of whom get only one visit per year, face emotional toil and loneliness.
According to the group’s website, the Alzheimer’s Buddies hopes to combat these feelings of isolation by visiting dementia patients on a weekly basis.
Jeffrey M. Robbins ’83, a Medical School teaching associate, said he started the program in memory of his mother after his father noticed how visits from young people could brighten up patients’ days.
The program went on a hiatus, but Ryan R. Christ ’13 said he revived the organization at the College and expanded it.
“I want other Harvard Students to know what it feels like to be a hero for someone else,” Christ said. “You might not wear a flashy jetpack, but with a little courage, you’ll be surprised by how far your smile will go.”

Over 600 alumni representing decades of Harvard Law School classes converged on the school’s campus this past weekend to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the first female graduates from the school.
Dubbed “Celebration 60,” the three-day conference included panel discussions that ranged from topics like national security to the future of legal education. The event’s programming was centered around this year’s theme “Leaders for Change—Women Transforming our Communities and the World.”
According to Marissa Wesely, a Law School graduate and co-chair of the event’s planning committee, the conference hoped to examine the successes of women in many fields, as well as shed light on the work being done to tackle issues of gender inequality.
Wesely said that people are now much more comfortable talking about the challenges faced by women, including the “enormous amount” of unconscious bias in the workplace.
The event was attended by professionals from a variety of careers, from current and first chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission Edith Ramirez ’89 to former U.S. Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick ’72 to Senior Vice President of the Oprah Winfrey Network Tina Perry.
The conference culminated in a Celebration 60 Gala Dinner on Saturday evening, during which U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren was awarded the Harvard Law School Association Award for her work in Congress. In a conversation with Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, Senator Warren discussed the current situation in Washington, D.C. and her plans to publish a book in the spring.
Warren said she was optimistic about the movement towards gender equality with respect to positions of leadership, albeit its slow pace.
Harvard Women’s Law Association President Nitzan Weizmann said that the main takeaway from the conference was that gender equity is still “doable.”
“Part of doing better for everybody is creating an environment that is more comfortable and more nurturing,” Weizmann said.
The conference’s attendees said that the event far surpassed expectations. Minow said there was “a lot of love” amongst the Law School alumni.
“There’s so much insight and energy and wisdom,” Minow said. “So many people identify with connections and build on those connections.”
In spite of the gains toward gender equality for women, some speakers agreed that there were still many steps left to go in the movement for gender equity.
“Keep working, never stop,” Senior Counsel for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Juanita C. Hernandez ’82 said in an interview Sunday. “Women hold up half the sky, and don’t forget that.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: Oct. 3, 2013
An earlier version of this article misstated the class year of Juanita C. Hernandez, senior counsel for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In fact, Hernandez graduated from the College in 1982, not 1989.
CORRECTION: Oct. 7, 2013
An earlier version of the Oct. 3 correction to this article incorrectly stated the context in which Hernandez made a statement offering advice to women. In fact, Hernandez made her statement in an interview on Sunday, not following a panel discussion on Saturday.

Since Harvard partnered with car rental provider Zipcar and bike share company Hubway, students increasingly have taken advantage of these companies’ discounted rates for Harvard affiliates, and the companies have added even more benefits over the years.
Both programs have allowed for Harvard affiliates to travel to destinations less easily accessible by Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority services.
Joe A. Paul ’17 said that he and his roommates in Straus Hall rented bikes this fall to visit Market Basket, a grocery store in Somerville.
Though their ride was fully funded by Hubway using coupons for a 24-hour free trial, Paul said he would use the bikes again for spontaneous trips that are “too far for walking and too short for the T.”
Harvard has invested largely in Boston’s bike share company since the program’s launch in April 2012. So far, the University has funded 12 Hubway stations in the area, which each cost about $50,000. These stations include a location behind Annenberg, one outside of the Holyoke Center, and most recently, at the Quad.
While Hubway and Zipcar provide different transportation services, the two companies have similar business models in which users pay a membership fee plus time-based usage fees.
Since the launch of Hubway’s Harvard affiliate discount in May 2013, 684 members of the Harvard community have taken advantage of the 40 percent reduced price, according to Colin B. Durrant,  a spokesperson for the Office for Sustainability. An annual membership for Hubway’s services is discounted for Harvard students and faculty at $50, compared to the normal cost of $85.
Zipcar, which was founded in Cambridge in 2000, has been offering a student discount since 2003. Membership fees are $15 for Harvard students, plus the hourly rates of $7.43 after joining. Daily fees are $84 for non-members. Both gas and insurance prices are included in the Zipcar rental fees.
Harvard was the first school in the region to adopt the Under-21 program, which allows students to rent Zipcars at 18, according to Benjamin A. Hammer, Commuter Choice Program coordinator.
Currently, there are 32 frequently-rented cars on Harvard’s campus eligible for the Under-21 program.
According to Hammer, there are over 10,000 active Zipcar accounts associated with a Harvard email address, thanks to the partnership between the University and the company. Over 1,100 of those members are under 21, according to Durrant.
To promote sustainable transportation and encourage more students to join the program, Ana Dorsey, a marketing coordinator at the Boston Zipcar office, said Sidewalk Sam, a street artist, will design parking spaces on Harvard’s campus to be reserved for Zipcar use only.

Harvard affiliates may soon face the consequences of the American spending and debt crises, most notably in areas related to research, student loans, and visa sponsorship.
 
As the U.S. reached its spending limit Tuesday morning and will reach its borrowing limit in a few weeks, concerns are surfacing regarding the impact of the country failing to pay its outstanding bills at institutions such as Harvard.
 
“Routine payments to grant student loans and research aid would not proceed at the same pace, if at all, if the government shutdown lasts longer than a few weeks,” said government professor Theda R. Skocpol.
 
Many of the federal grants received by Harvard are used for research across multiple fields. Economics professor Eric S. Maskin ’72 said that he received an email from the National Science Foundation, which stated that the Foundation will close in the event of a shutdown.
 
“For the Harvard professor that would mean if you already had a grant, you would not immediately be affected since the money has most likely already been transferred to Harvard, but if you are applying for a grant, you will have to wait for your grant to be processed,” Maskin said.
 
As a result, Maskin said that many new research projects may not be able to begin if federal funding has not already been secured.
 
“Many aspects of what we do at Harvard rely on federal funding,” said economics professor Benjamin M. Friedman '66. “Students, especially those involved in scientific research, would be affected if research must stop because of lack of funding.” 
 
The government shutdown could also potentially impact a wide array of federal agencies due to lack of funding.
 
“In the event of a government shutdown, visas and passports, which many students and professors rely on, will not be processed,” Skocpol said, adding that this would prevent students and professors from receiving visa and passport renewals for some time.
 
“I want students to know that the debt ceiling crisis is political and not fiscal, so students have the power to vote in elections and potentially change the political environment,” Skocpol said.

At the Bruno Fall Classic on Sep. 7, the Harvard men’s water polo team surrendered a three-goal fourth quarter lead against Ivy League rival Brown. On Saturday night at Blodgett Pool, the Crimson once again held a lead going into the final eight minutes of the game against the Bears.
But this time, Harvard was able to hold on, avenging its loss to Brown earlier in the season, 6-5. The victory was the highlight of the Crimson’s three-game weekend sweep, which also included wins over Connecticut College and local rival MIT.
 
Harvard (7-8, 5-1 CWPA Northern) started off its first homestand of the season strong on Saturday with a 16-3 routing of the Camels (1-10, 0-6 CWPA Northern). The Crimson was able to take down the Engineers (4-9, 3-3 CWPA Northern) on Sunday to cap off an undefeated weekend.
 
 
HARVARD 13, MIT 10
 
With the game knotted up at seven goals apiece late in the third period, Harvard freshman Viktor Wrobel fired a shot that looked to have crossed the goal line, but was not counted as a goal. On the very next Crimson possession, Wrobel left no doubt, firing one of his five goals to the back of the net to give Harvard a lead that it would never relinquish.
 
In the first period, The Crimson jumped out to a two goal lead it held for most of the game. MIT was able to tie the game up twice. Both times, however, Harvard was able to pull away, extending the team’s only winning streak of the season to four games.
 
“It got close,“ sophomore Noah Harrison said, "but we looked inside of ourselves…and got out there and put them away.”
 
Harrison and sophomore Ben Zepfel each added two goals to help edge the Engineers on Sunday. Harrison’s six goals on the weekend added to his team leading 32 scores on the season. Sophomore goalie Colin Woolway led the defensive effort for Harvard, registering six saves in Sunday’s victory.
 
“It was nice to walk out with a win,” co-captain Jimmy Field said. “[But] there are still things we can work on, as always. We’re constantly looking to improve ourselves. But today was a good win.” 
 
HARVARD 6, BROWN 5
 
The Crimson was able to tally two goals in the third period to hold a two-goal lead going into the fourth period. Unable to add another goal, Harvard relied on stout defense to help preserve the win. The Bears were only able to put one goal past Woolway in the fourth period as Harvard was able to cling to a one-goal lead as the clock expired.
 
Woolway provided four crucial saves in the game, helping hold the Crimson lead even after the offense stalled late in the second half.
 
“I’d say our defense [was the difference],” Harrison said. “We had way fewer letdowns on defense this time. We played as a team.”
 
Harvard opened the scoring on Saturday night, jumping out to a 3-1 lead. Brown quickly responded, however, recording three unanswered goals to take the lead.
 
But the Bears’ lead was short-lived. The Crimson quickly erased the deficit, tying the game at four goals going into halftime before taking the lead for good.
 
“We really just had the mental fortitude,” Field said. “[We] didn’t let them reclaim the lead once we had it…it was our mental toughness.”
 
Colton led Harvard with two goals on the night.  Harrison and freshman Dan Stevens also were integral members of the Crimson attack, each registering a goal and assist.
 
Saturday night’s win against Brown is the first for Harvard in their last 16 meetings, going all the way back to 2006.
 
HARVARD 16, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 3 
 
Eight players notched goals in the Crimson’s thrashing of Connecticut College in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader. Harvard built up a comfortable seven-goal lead in the first period en route to an easy victory against the one-win Camels. Connecticut College has yet to defeat the Crimson in men’s water polo.
 
Harrison, Wrobel, and Zepfel each recorded hat tricks on the day to lead a balanced Harvard attack. Both Field and Woolway performed well in net, each saving five shots on goal.
 
Sophomores Robbie Fluegge and Chris Miao and freshman Joey Colton also propelled the Crimson offense, each providing two assists.
 Harvard improved its record in the CWPA Northern Division to 5-1 with its three wins this weekend.
 “We came in really wanting to win,” Field said. “We really wanted to go 3-0 [on the weekend]. And that’s what we did.”

Two weeks after beating Yale in the 100th iteration of the Harvard-Yale meet at Boston’s Franklin Park, consistency and individual improvements carried the Crimson women’s cross country team into a fourth-place finish at Virginia’s Panorama Farms invitational.
Viviana Hanley, the junior who finished first at the meet two weeks ago, managed to shave off 31 seconds from her previous time to finish first for Harvard and 19th place overall. Captain Morgan Kelly likewise took off almost half a minute for a time of 17:34.
Coming ten places behind Kelly, freshman Madeleine Ankhelyi clocked a 17:56 to give the Crimson its final sub-18 minute 5k time for the race. At the two-mile mark, all three runners were separated by roughly ten seconds.
“Harvard-Yale was a wonderful opening to our season, but the race this weekend at Panorama Farms was our first chance, as a team, to compete at a large invite,” Ankhelyi said. “The course was challenging, and allowed us to make a real testimony to the hard training we’ve been putting in. It was definitely mentally tough to get through, but having such a supportive team made it that much easier. At any point during the race, I was able to look up and find another crimson uniform in the crowd around me. We have improved since our first race at Franklin Park, and this season is bound to see a lot more coming from Harvard women’s cross country.”
Three of the next four to finish for Harvard—junior Jennifer Guidera, freshman Caroline Marshall, and junior Erika Veidis—were not able to produce half-minute improvements like Hanley and Kelly, but managed to stay as a pack, as they all passed the two mile mark within a second of 11:29. The trio finished in the top 60, with Guidera leading the way with a time of 18:10.
For those three, as well as sophomore Selena Pasadyn, the final mile would prove to be the deciding factor. Pasadyn, leading Guidera by 12 seconds at the two mile mark, fell behind, as Guidera clocked a strong 6:41 final mile on her way to finishing 38th overall.
Guidera passed 21 runners in the last mile of the race, more than any other runner at the invitational. Despite the strong kick, Guidera was unable to pass Navy’s Christina Blair, who edged the junior by one one-hundredth of a second.
“I definitely would have liked to have passed that girl,” Guidera said. “I was pretty tired and I was coming through with a bunch of people on that final stretch. If I could go back, I would’ve liked to have passed her.”
The combined effort from the rest of the team helped Harvard top Ole Miss and California by 6 and 14 points, respectively. Virginia, ranked 16th nationally and running on its home turf, took first with a total of 42 points, while William and Mary and Eastern Kentucky finished second and third, respectively.
“The most important thing for the team is going to be staying healthy,” Kelly said. “We’re off to a really good start…[and] we’re going to keep on improving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After 39 minutes of field hockey action, New Hampshire sophomore forward Meg Flaherty shot from the left side of the goal. The ball would find the back of the net, giving the Wildcats (5-4, 0-0) a 2-1 lead on Flaherty’s second goal of the game. Harvard (2-4, 1-1) was unable to mount a comeback in the second half, eventually falling to New Hampshire, 3-1, at Memorial Field on Sunday afternoon. 
Though the Crimson failed to score in the second half, it was not for a lack of chances. In the final fifteen minutes, Harvard earned three penalty corners and fired four shots, three of which were on goal.
A late goal by Wildcat senior forward Hannah Richard took away any chance the Crimson had for tying the game in the last few minutes. Even though Harvard allowed the late goal, junior forward Noel Painter thought the team improved its play near the end of the game.
“In the last seven minutes, we were really pressuring UNH when they had the ball in their backfield,” Painter said. “That forced some turnovers that we tried to take advantage of. If we had been able to start forcing those bad passes earlier in the game, I think we would have been able to score again.”
Though the Crimson failed to score during the team’s aggressive finish, Harvard came out strong against New Hampshire, scoring just 12 minutes into the game.
After a deflected shot, Crimson senior forward Rachael Rosenfeld found herself in front of the goal with the ball and put it in the back of the cage.  The goal was not without controversy, however, as the Wildcats argued that the ball hit a player’s hand before Rosenfeld scored.
“Everyone thought the ref was going to call it and stop the play,” Painter said. “Everyone on both teams stopped moving for a split-second expecting a call, when there wasn’t one Rachael shot it into the back of the net.”
The goal would stand, but New Hampshire was able to answer just four minutes later with the first of Flaherty’s two goals. The Wildcats took a penalty corner and worked the ball around to senior midfielder Casey Pohlmeyer who then fired at goal. Flaherty deflected Pohlmeyer’s shot into the goal to tie the game at one.
After New Hampshire tied the game, Harvard would only manage three more shots until its barrage in the final fifteen minutes. Though statistics never tell the whole story, sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson did notice a drop-off in play after New Hampshire took the lead.
“I definitely think we lost some energy throughout the game,” Jacobson said. “We picked it up in the last few minutes by getting more aggressive on defense which helped create some opportunities on offense for us. We just need to do better with those opportunities.”
Flaherty and junior forward Caitlin Rea led the team with shots-on-goal with two each, while goalie Jenn Hatfield finished the day with five saves.  The Crimson has experienced an up-and-down season so far, and this game was very much the same way.
“UNH is a very tough team,” Jacobson said. “I think we held our own. They ultimately won, but I think we showed ourselves that we can compete with a really good team”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Harvard football wasn’t the only program that won big this weekend.
While the Crimson took on Brown in its home opener, the Harvard men’s basketball team locked up two key commitments after hosting several recruits on official campus visits.
Three-star guard Andre Chatfield committed Sunday morning, and four-star power forward Chris Egi quickly followed suit. Egi confirmed his commitment via Twitter on Sunday night, stating, “I'm proud to say I will be attending Harvard University in the upcoming school year. God truly is good.”
Egi is a four-star recruit from Canada, who transferred into Montverde Academy in Florida for his final year of high school. The 6’9” forward reportedly turned down offers from the likes of California and Washington to play for the Crimson. Egi—Scout.com’s seventh ranked center—has decided to reclassify to 2014 from 2015.
Egi played AAU basketball with CIA Bounce, where he averaged 10.6 points per game and led the team with 7.7 rebounds per game. He ranked second in 17U EBYL with 48 blocks.
Chatfield is a three-star recruit from Norcross High School in Gerogia. The 6’5” shooting guard played for Atlanta Celtics AAU and will join Texas shooting guard Zach Yosher—who committed in August—in Harvard’s backcourt.
Since hiring coach Tommy Amaker in 2007, the Crimson has seen a rapid rise in its returns on recruiting. In his first season at Harvard, Amaker recruited Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, who led the Crimson to the NCAA Tournament as captains in 2012. Since then, Amaker has landed the likes of three-star forward Kenyatta Smith and the program’s first top-100 recruit in freshman forward Zena Edosomwan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard freshman Midge Purce continued to dominate offensively for the Crimson (5-3-1, 1-0 Ivy), scoring her fifth goal of the season Sunday night against Central Connecticut State University (2-7-0) in a 2-0 win.
In the 61st minute, Purce took advantage of a Blue Devil turnover and escaped the defense, giving her a one-on-one opportunity against goalkeeper Nikola Deiter. A quick shot to the back corner of the net put Harvard up 2-0, a score that would hold until the end of the match.
Purce leads the team in goals and points overall with nine. She is now ranked third in the Ivy League in goals scored, number one in shots, and tied for third in overall points.
Overall, the freshman players have added a major spark to the team, contributing significant skill early on in the 2013 season. Freshman players Karly Zlatic, Bailey Gary, and Lizzie Durack have seen significant playing time despite this being their first season at the collegiate level.
“[Purce] is an exciting and dynamic player, very strong on the ball,” said Crimson head coach Ray Leone. “She’s added a lot to our team, along with many other players.”
Coming off a victory against Penn on Friday, the team looked to keep their winning ways in tact. Prior to the contest, the team had won four games in a row following a tough start to the season.
In 2012, Harvard tied the Blue Devils in double overtimem 0-0. Although the Crimson dominated the shot count, 31-9, the team was unable to find the back of the net. In Sunday evening’s match, however, Harvard scored early in the first period and held the lead for the remainder of the contest.
The Crimson gained momentum early when a corner kick by co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson was received by sophomore defender Emily Mosbacher, who was able to head the ball past the Central Connecticut goalkeeper into the top left corner.
“It was a great corner kick, “ Leone said. “It was a good opportunity for us. The goalkeepers were both really strong so it was going to take a really good goal tonight to get somewhere, so that was an excellent go-ahead that we needed.”
The Blue Devils came close to scoring on two separate occasions in the contest.  The first scoring opportunity came off of a corner in the first half when sophomore Cailynn Harding attempted a header toward the net, but the ball sailed clear over the crossbar. Later in the second period, freshman Morgan Santoro received the ball just inside the box, but a key save by Durack kept Central scoreless.
Freshman defender Bailey Gary was key to the Harvard defense. Providing backup to Durack, Gary was able to clear many Blue Devil crosses in front of the net. The Crimson defender was also vital in clearing the ball to the midfield line to shift the momentum and put Harvard on the offensive. The freshman has started every game this season, as her solid performance along with the rest of the defense has been crucial to recent team success.
Although Harvard has been rotating its three goalies in recent games, Durack was between the pipes the full 90 minutes and recorded four saves on the night. The freshman keeper has only allowed one goal in four games played, two of which she started. Sunday night was Durack’s second shutout of the season.
Although the two teams were close in shots, Harvard outnumbered the Blue Devils in shots on net, 10-4. Overall, the Crimson had 15 shots compared to the Central Connecticut’s ten. Junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby led Harvard with three shots.
If there was one thing the team could work on, Leone said, it would be possession. Although the team’s possessing against the Blue Devils improved from the Penn game, it is something the team is still looking to get better at for the games to come.
“Moving the ball a little bit quicker is definitely something we will work on this week,” Leone said. “Overall it was a good game. It was a really challenging fast-paced game against an excellent Central Connecticut team.”
Harvard returns to Ivy League play next weekend as it faces rival the Yale Bulldogs. Both teams remain undefeated within the Ancient Eight, but only one will escape unscathed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a goalie’s game on Saturday afternoon when Harvard field hockey (3-3, 1-1 Ivy) faced Penn (6-1, 2-0) at home, but only one of the keepers escaped unscathed. With less than ten minutes left in the first half, a shot from Penn sophomore attack Elizabeth Hitti ricocheted off the post and gave the Quakers a lead they never relinquished.
“It came off a penalty corner [and] we tried to outlet it [but] it was just a failed outlet,” Crimson goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield said of the lone goal. “When the corner came it was a drag flick to the top left corner of the cage; my stick side. I made an attempt at it [but] it hit the post, pulling me out of position and went straight to the other side. It was a tipper wide open on the opposite post.”
It was the only goal of the game as Penn held on to win 1-0.
Hatfield was the highlight of the Harvard defense as she had 10 saves in the game. She has played every minute so far this season, allowing a league-low 1.6 goals per game.
Despite the defensive support, the Crimson offense struggled to put balls on net as the side’s woes from the first two games of the 2013 season returned. In those contests, Harvard was outscored 5-1.
For the Quakers, Carly Sokach was a force behind the net with 12 saves, diving and leaping all over the circle to help keep the Crimson scoreless. This was Sokach’s second shutout in the past three games, bringing her average goals against to 1.86.
Both teams remained scoreless in the second half.
“We made two technical changes in the second half which I think went pretty well,” Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “We were able to push strongly in the second half where we were really present in their circle more than they were in ours.”
The Crimson was able to limit Penn to only six shots in the second period, compared to 10 in the first, likely resulting from the adjustments van Herwaarden made at halftime.
Harvard saw several breakaways by sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson, senior forward Rachael Rosenfeld, and junior midfielder Caitlin Rea. Freshman Marissa Balleza led the Crimson with seven shots, but it was a group offensive effort as six different Harvard players had shots on net.
“There wasn’t anyone that really stuck out,” van Herwaarden said. “It was a team effort.”
A timeout called late in the second half gave Harvard a chance to strategize and create a scoring opportunity, but the team was unable to connect.
“We should have capitalized on one of the chances that we created, and unfortunately that didn’t happen,” van Herwaarden said. “Eventually that’s what the game is all about…We called a timeout and bumped a player up to try and really get some offensive play done, but unfortunately it wasn’t enough.”
A last chance offensive push gave the Crimson a chance to tie up the game with less than three minutes left. Freshman forward Sarah Finnemore passed the ball off to junior forward Noel Painter in the circle and Painter fired a shot towards the net, but Sokach was able to block the shot to secure a Quaker win.
For Penn, this was a continuation of its winning ways as it came out on top for the fourth consecutive game, while the loss for Harvard ended the team’s previous two game winning streak.
The Crimson will look to get back on track as Ancient Eight play continues on Saturday against Brown.
“We’re really excited to make adjustments and improve, specifically just playing our style,” Hatfield said. “We need to keep moving the ball, keep the ball speed up and we need to finish. We need to take advantage of when we’re open, and we’re going to shoot, and we’re going to score, and we’re going to finish.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The timeless maxim repeatedly sounded by football coaches at any level is that turnovers will always come back to haunt you. The old adage could not have been more appropriate than on Saturday night in the Harvard football team’s conference opener.
Brown turned the ball over four times, and the Crimson capitalized on those mistakes to build a sizable lead and seize control of a game that would eventually turn into a 41-23 rout.
The first two Bears turnovers came in the second quarter—and Harvard gratefully accepted the gifts by punching the ball into the end zone each time.
The initial Brown miscue came when junior defensive back Norman Hayes took a swipe at Bears tailback John Spooney and jarred the ball loose. After senior tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu pounced on the ball, Hempel and the Crimson offense needed just two plays to take advantage of the short field position for six points.
Just a few players later, Brown’s most costly error came when quarterback Patrick Donnelly’s pass bounced off a Bears receiver and into the hands of senior defensive back Jaron Wilson, who cut and slipped his way past a number of would-be tacklers before diving into the end zone.
The 51-yard interception return put Harvard up 21-13 late in the second quarter. Whereas the Bears had seemingly been moving the ball at will in the first quarter, those two turnovers threw a wrench into the smooth Brown attack and allowed Harvard to pick up much-needed points.
“The biggest thing was turnovers,” Bears coach Phil Estes said. “We got up right away…. After that, once we had the Spooney fumble it kind of turned the momentum their way. And when that happened we didn’t have an answer for them. They just picked up the tempo.”
Donnelly went on to throw two more interceptions, although the Crimson offense would not put any additional points on the board off of them.
Harvard committed three turnovers of its own—although one resulted from a Brown punt that bounced off an unsuspecting Harvard special teamer early in the fourth quarter. But unlike the explosive Crimson offense in the second quarter, the Bears were never able to take advantage of the miscues and swing the momentum the other way.
ONE QUARTER SHADED BROWN, ANOTHER TINTED CRIMSON
Nothing was going Harvard’s way. After an interception thrown by junior quarterback Conner Hempel led to Brown’s first touchdown, the Bears successfully executed a surprise onside kick and later forced a Harvard three-and-out to end a 13-0 quarter.
The Crimson gained only 55 yards in the first period of play. The Brown offense, on the other hand, possessed the ball for a dominant 10:38 of the opening 15 minutes and never seemed to leave the field.
But the second quarter was a different story. Harvard played like an inspired team, quickly forcing a Brown punt and marching down the field for a 72-yard touchdown drive capped by a Hempel run.
The next two scores came off two Brown turnovers, propelling the Crimson into the lead. But Harvard was not finished with its second quarter exploits. After another Bears punt, Hempel and the Crimson perfectly executed a two-minute drill to push the score to 28-13.
“It was just like San Diego, quite frankly,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Our defense couldn’t get off the field, our offense couldn’t really stay on the field. And that’s not a good combination. It’s amazing to me that we scored 40 points two games in a row because we just haven’t had a lot of possession time.”
Although the Bears won the time of possession battle again in the second quarter, the Crimson’s offensive efficiency rendered that stat irrelevant for the time being. In the quarter, Harvard racked up 167 total yards to Brown’s 50. Three touchdowns on three drives, plus an interception returned for a score, had completely turned the game around.
THE PENALTY BOX
On some instances, the flags put the Crimson in undesirable situations.
On the first play of Brown’s third drive, senior linebacker Conner Loftus was penalized for a facemask that moved the Bears into striking distance. And just three plays later, Donnelly found a receiver in the corner of the end zone for the touchdown.
With Harvard on defense later in the quarter, Wilson intercepted a pass and ran it back for the Crimson score. But the senior was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct call for diving into the end zone, and Brown received even better field position after another penalty forced Harvard to kick off from its own 15. Luckily for the Crimson, the defense was able to ensure a quick stop.
In the second half, a big kickoff return by sohpomore Andrew Fischer was negated after a block in the back, and a sizable gain by sophomore running back Paul Stanton was brought back in the fourth after another flag.
In total, Harvard committed 12 penalties costing the team 89 yards—something the team will need to cut down on as the conference schedule continues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s easy to forget today, but for a moment in the third quarter Saturday, Brown breathed life. The Bears had just marched 80 yards in less than four minutes. Brown running back John Spooney finished the drive with a 34-yard touchdown scamper that brought the visitors within 11, 31-20. There was plenty of time left.
On the ensuing kickoff, a Harvard penalty forced the Crimson to start the possession on its own 16. And on the first play of the drive, a Brown linebacker showed up right in junior quarter Conner Hempel’s passing lane.
But the Bears defender hardly managed to get a paw on the throw, and the deflect pass found its way into senior tight end Cam Brate’s breadbasket. Brate gathered the pass for a 19-yard gain.
Two plays later, Hempel stayed calm in the face of a blitz, finding Ricky Zorn down the sideline for a 63-yard touchdown. In less than two minutes, Harvard had moved the ball 84 yards and put the game to bed before the fourth quarter. Again.
Last week against San Diego, the Crimson started slow and entered halftime up by one, 14-13. In the second half though, the team clicked on both sides of the ball. Hempel led the offense on three scoring drives that each took less than two minutes, and another that took 2:09. The defense only allowed one more score, and that only came with Harvard up big. The Crimson won, 42-20.
Saturday, Harvard must have decided it liked the way that game went. This time the Crimson spotted its opposition 13 points before getting on the board. But by the second quarter, Harvard had another 14-13 lead. It was clicking again.
Senior safety Jaron Wilson returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown. Sophomore running back Paul Stanton scored from 15 yards out minutes later. And when Brown scored in the fourth quarter, it didn’t matter. At the end of the game, the score was nearly the same as it was a week ago. This time Harvard won 41-23.
Both safety and running back were question marks a few months ago. It turns out they are still well-functioning parts of the Harvard machine. The offense was loaded with new faces coming into this year. Now we know it’s simply loaded. We should have seen this coming.
Over the last six years, Harvard is 35-3 against every Ivy team besides Penn, and that includes last year’s aberration at Princeton. That’s not by mistake. Once again Saturday, it was Harvard who won the turnover battle, made the big plays, and fell on loose balls.
At the start of the game, it was Brown who controlled play. It entered the game as the biggest contender to Harvard and Penn’s collective reign—the only other team to earn a first-place vote in the preseason poll. On the Bears’ second drive, returning starting quarterback Patrick Donnelly led the team on a 78-yard scoring drive. Then Brown recovered a surprise onside kick and scored a second touchdown less than two minutes later.
It looked like this might be the Bears’ year. Now, we know better. Of course, Brown still has a chance to compete for its first outright title since 2005. In fact, the Bears lost to Harvard in Cambridge that year too.
But now Brown head coach Phil Estes is resigned to hoping the Crimson slip up multiple times. Historically speaking, that seems unlikely.
Next week, Harvard travels to Holy Cross. The Crusaders are coming off a come-from-behind win at Dartmouth they capped with a last-minute field goal. It was an impressive win, until you remember that you can’t draw too many conclusions about an early-season non-conference matchup. Sometimes, a team makes a few mistakes and loses to a lesser foe.
Just not this team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following an 84-0 routing of Yale last weekend, the Harvard women’s rugby team (1-2, 0-1 Ivy) came into its first road contest of the season looking to go on another offensive tear.
But unlike the prior week’s contest, the Crimson had a difficult time capitalizing on offense and ultimately fell to Dartmouth in a 10-5 decision.
“We ended up losing by five points which was disappointing,” co-captain Ali Haber said. “We definitely had the power to beat them.”
The match-up marked Harvard’s first official Ivy League test of the season. The Big Green entered the contest with some solid wins under its belt, as Dartmouth topped Bowdoin, 32-5, in a preseason match, and followed it up with a 24-10 victory over Cornell.
“They were just more coordinated as a team and a bit more aggressive,” Haber said. “It was pretty frustrating.”
The Crimson was the first on the board in this weekend’s match-up, as co-captain Xanni Brown scored Harvard’s only try in the first half. The Crimson maintained its 5-0 advantage heading into the last 40 minutes of play.
But the Big Green came firing back in the second half and registered two tries to ultimately come out of the contest on top.
The low-scoring game was mainly a defensive affair, and Harvard had few opportunities to put points up on the board.
“We definitely did a lot of defending in the first half, more than we did playing offense,” co-captain Brandy Machado said.
The team acknowledged some holes in its defense, which allowed Dartmouth many scoring opportunities and put the Crimson back on its heels.
“They had really been knocking on the door for a while,” Brown said.  “We just weren’t able to adjust.”
Late in the game, Harvard had a hard time stopping the Big Green’s offensive charges.
“We just had some times where we sort of folded,” Machado said. “[Those times] were important. They definitely caught us on our backs.”
The Crimson also had a hard time picking up its stride as the team struggled with penalties throughout the entire match.
“It was probably the game with the most penalties [that] I’ve ever played in my life,” Haber said. “We were just doing what we do and getting called for everything.”
With the disappointing outcome, the team knows what it wants to work on in preparation for the rest of its matches this season. The team will be focusing on communication, aggression, and working towards coming together as a group, instead of relying on individual players.
“[We need a] whole team effort instead of individual bursts,” Haber said. “That’s what we were lacking in that game. I think part of that is learning to trust each other on the field. We may just need a bit more practice with the people in the group. It also has to come from us, the captains. That’s our job to keep the team cohesive and talking to each other and build that trust.”
The team will try to be even more cohesive on the field, a tough task for the new varsity squad that is working to include some new members in its lineup.
“We got a lot of rookies this year,” Haber said. “They’re super great and we’re really excited to have them. It’s unfortunate that [for] some of them, this was their first game to see, but they’ve been incredible. They’ve been committed, and we’re so happy to have them in the family, so we want to make sure that they see what we really can do.”
Harvard is ready for a tough week of practices as it prepares to take on Brown this weekend in yet another road contest. The Crimson also has its eyes towards some other tough teams coming up on its schedule.
“Training this week is going to be hard,” Brown said. “It’s going to be physical, and we’re going to need to get ourselves into the headspace we need to be in to take on these really tough teams. We’re probably going back to the basics, back to the drawing board on some stuff. [We need] to build up and try to find what’s going to give us success in this league.”

In what Yalies have termed the “Poopgate” scandal, unknown persons have allegedly been defecating and urinating in the laundry machines of a Yale dormitory. While one might guess that the University would have the capacity to handle the matter swiftly, several weeks after the original incident there is at least one rumored suspect still on the loose. The disgusting trend started in Saybrook, one of Yale’s residential colleges.
Proud of their college’s number one ranking in respect to dirty laundry, Yalies have embraced this scandal. Students have reportedly thrown a “Dirty Laundry” themed party, done some video reporting, and even written a song, entitled “Poopa Poopa.” We can only hope that Yale’s smart students put their minds together and think of a way to out the culprit and prevent another unfortunate incident. Then again, it has been two weeks.
We can only hope…

There’s nothing worse than walking into an Ec 10 lecture as a junior, except for maybe the declining elephant population—but let’s be honest, it’s kind of a toss-up. Yet for some reason, despite the fact that we are old enough to know better, and that all of our peers have already taken the classes, we find ourselves taking freshman intro classes as upperclassmen. It’s pretty embarrassing, so here are some tips for maintaining your reputation.
1. Lie Shamelessly
You should already be ashamed that you are in a freshman class; is lying really that much worse? So when your Math 1a or freshman seminar advisor assumes that you are a freshman, don’t correct him, let him think that your inability to finish readings on time stems from the “awkward transition period” in freshman fall, and not from your refusal to use your textbook in public.
2. Come to Class Early
The seven-minute rule doesn’t really apply to freshmen as they have yet to learn the basics of analog and still have the weird idea that coming to class early somehow correlates with higher midterm exam grades and getting punched for a final club. Regardless of why they do it, their promptness makes you look tardy. Your tardiness also doesn’t help. So start coming to class early. Two years early would probably be best, but seven minutes works as well.
3. Be Cool and Indifferent
Be the independent upperclassman who silently sits in section judging everyone who participates. If you are feeling ambitious, try sleeping in lecture. If you are super ambitious, try ditching class and sleeping in a different lecture. You will look cool, and more importantly, you will finally get your eight hours of sleep in.

While we may have come in second on U.S. News & World Report's latest list, at least we’re winning where it counts. That’s right, boys and girls, the Betches from Betches Love This have given our humble university the number one spot on their list of Ivy League betchiness. This is quite possibly our biggest accomplishment to date! (I would go so far as to argue that this is even more impressive than the $2.8 billion we have already raised for the Harvard Campaign.)
You may be asking yourself, just how exactly did we achieve such a feat?
The Betches have a ranking system of their own, which they base on factors like exclusivity, hotness, and celebrity alumni—but they missed a few key reasons why we are rightly the betchiest Ivy League university of them all.
1. Sushi in Lamont. 
Our 24-hour library serves sushi until 2 a.m. every night. Does it get betchier than this anywhere in the world?
2. Veritaffles.
Our waffle makers literally have our insignia engraved into them.
3. Free HBO. 
Harvard has hooked us up with free HBO for as long as we go here. Now we can have sushi and Game of Thrones marathons in the library or watch Girls whenever we want.
4. Libraries. 
An unmatched set of academic libraries, with basically the most books in the world and blah, blah, blah, nobody cares; we all know it’s about the fun library traditions.
5. Harvard = Hogwarts. 
With Annenberg and our 12-House sorting system, we basically go to that secret magical university that everyone looks up to growing up… not only do we get to live out our dreams now, but we also get to live out everyone else’s.

It’s punch season again at Harvard, meaning final club members are busy attending social events and slipping wax-sealed envelopes under doors. Apparently, however, they’re not all on board with the system of which they are, quite literally, dues-paying members. In Flyby’s recent Final Club Survey, 6 percent of respondents who identified themselves as final club members said they believed male final clubs should be abolished, and an additional 9 percent were undecided on the question. Respondents who identified as final club members also weren’t convinced that female final clubs should exist—5 percent said they think those clubs should be abolished, and 8 percent were undecided.
What do non-final club members think? Good question. Flyby wanted to know more about the perception of final clubs, on campus and across various demographics, so we asked upperclassmen—sophomores, juniors, and seniors—for their thoughts on Harvard’s eight male and five female final clubs. The results of our email survey will be released in a six-part series beginnning on Tuesday.
 
In our first installment, read about how we collected data and who took our survey. On Wednesday, find out about the self-reported demographics of final club membership. Thursday we will look at survey respondents’ perceptions of prestige and exclusivity among the clubs. Friday will be all about perceptions of the attractiveness and intellect of members of different clubs. Saturday we’ll examine what people think about the social scene at the clubs. Finally, on Sunday we’ll ask the big questions and share the big answers—do survey respondents think final clubs are a positive presence on Harvard’s campus? And do they think the clubs should exist at all?
 
The results of our survey range from the exceedingly obvious to the mildly surprising to the downright bizarre. We at Flyby have learned a lot about how final clubs are perceived on campus in the process of sorting through this data, and we look forward to sharing it with all of you in the coming week.
