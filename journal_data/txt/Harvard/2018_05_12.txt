In the memoir “The Trapp Family Singers,” which inspired the musical “The Sound of Music,” the real-life Maria Augusta Trapp recalled how her love for the von Trapp children—not for the von Trapp patriarch Georg—permeated her marriage. In fact, Maria, who was on the path to becoming a nun, was disappointed that the nuns encouraged the marriage as God’s will. “Th-they s-s-said I have to m-m-m-marry you!” Maria writes in the memoir, capturing the sobs she heaved as a conflicted young woman pressured into marrying the Captain. Her prose describes less of a romantic love story with the Captain, and more of a stick-it-out-for-the-sake-of-the-children endeavor.
In a new production of “The Sound of Music,” a fictionalized portrayal of the character Maria Rainer’s transition from postulant to governess, wife, and stepmother centralizes the bond between Maria (played by Jill-Christine Wiley) and the seven von Trapp children. At its best, this production, which is playing at the Wang Theatre from May 1 to 13, provides an evening of favorite songs and lighthearted family fun, epitomized by these endearing relationships. Some poor blocking choices, jarring transitions between scenes, and an overall unresolved tension between the production’s crisp 21st-century look and its sporadically referenced World War II undercurrent, however, detract from the viewing experience.
Wiley’s Maria has great chemistry with the von Trapp children, more than she has with Captain von Trapp (played by Mike McLean). Though this lack of romance—and McLean’s bland performance—is perhaps in line with Maria Augusta Trapp’s memoir, it dulls the mood of the musical and weakens the viewer’s capacity to buy into its dramatized storyline. In contrast, when Maria first arrives at the von Trapp Villa, she manages to pique the children’s interest and win them over with song. Together, Wiley and the cute and charming brood of young actors sing “Do-Re-Mi,” and, in Wiley’s hands, Maria builds a strong connection with them because she treats them as equals and challenges their curiosity with wordplay and choreography. She breaks down the melody into notes, tunefully explains how to incorporate words into a song, and includes each child—including a reluctant sixteen-year-old Liesl (played by Keslie Ward)—in the activity. From this foundation, Maria’s communication with the children is comfortable, believable, and heartwarming.
For fans of the 1965 movie version of “The Sound of Music,” starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, it is worth noting that this staged revival leans more toward the original Broadway musical from 1959, in terms of its songs (including “How Can Love Survive?” and “No Way to Stop It,” which are not performed in the movie) and the order in which the performers sing them. For example, on the Wang Theatre’s stage “My Favorite Things,” is not performed by Maria and the children, but is rather a duet between Maria and Mother Abbess (played by Lauren Kidwell), who encourages Maria to embrace life and love beyond the abbey’s walls. And Maria sings the yodeling-heavy song “The Lonely Goatherd” to calm and entertain the children during a thunderstorm, not during a puppet show as in the movie version. While the placement of “The Lonely Goatherd” works especially well in this production—again, foregrounding Maria and the children’s comfortable relationship—the staging of “My Favorite Things” feels a bit heavy handed in its wistfulness.
The creative team behind the production clearly aimed to reinvigorate this version by using a fresh-from-the-shop set, by intensifying dramatic moments with bright blue lighting, and by casting young actors in the principal roles. Yet irregular and dangling references to the looming war feel at odds with this staging. “Today, it’s difficult to tell who’s a friend and who’s an enemy,” Captain von Trapp says quite vaguely when thinking about whom he might invite to a dinner party. In addition to the show’s unresolved contemporary look and historical premise, throughout the production several actors inexplicably turn their backs to the audience while onstage. These blocking choices make it difficult to stay engaged with the characters. Choppy transitions between scenes further reduce the cohesiveness of the show. Despite these shortcomings, the sound of the beloved music has its winning moments.

“How much love can be repeated? How many people are worth waiting for?” croons an amateur singer, words that echo throughout Jia Zhangke’s “Ash Is the Purest White.” As it turns out, not that many—if any at all—at least for Qiao (Zhao Tao). Qiao is in love with Bin (Liao Fan), a mobster, a “jianghu,” a person for whom “it’s killed or be killed,” as Bin describes. He’s right, of course: On a night out with Qiao, Bin is nearly beaten to death by a gang of men before Qiao scares them off with her gun—or rather, the illegal gun Bin gave her. When Qiao gets arrested and refuses to turn in her love, she gets sentenced to five years in prison to his one year, after which she returns to find Bin hoping to pick up where they left off. What follows is a decades-long saga of a love lost and maybe never found in Zhangke’s latest chef d’oeuvre.
The director’s eighth feature film, the fifth to screen in competition at Cannes, “Ash Is Purest White” is a testament to Zhangke’s mastery of cinematic artistry. His experience pays off: The film is a visual goldmine of expert use of camera work, of shot composition, of sound, and most crucially, of color saturation and pigmentation. Ash may be purest white, but it is color that reigns in the film; in the pink of Qiao’s jacket, a rosy fluorescent that evokes her younger self before she too becomes a “jianghu;” in the blue of her prison uniform, a motif that comes back to stifle her on a train ride back home; in the dead, pale yellow of her blouse as she persistently, hopelessly tries to locate Bin upon her release; in the black of her hard-earned, expensive clothes, years later. The film is a kaleidoscope of color, hues tinted just the right shade and lights lit just bright enough to bathe the characters in the perfect glow. The colors speak more than the characters do, diffusing an ambiance that pervades throughout the ethereal film.
Indeed, as Qiao says to Bin, “Jianghu people like you never speak plainly,” or even at all, but the characters never need to with a talented cast like this one. Zhao and Liao emote powerfully with their faces, their eyes doing all the talking in even the tensest moments. In the hotel room Qiao finally manages to drag Bin out to when he refuses to answer any of her calls, Qiao and Bin say more to each other without making eye contact in the emotional climax of the film than they do in any other scene. Qiao sits on a bed on the left side of the room, her face pointed past Bin’s as her eyes glaze over looking into the distance. Bin is on the right side, his face resolute as he stares indifferently away from Qiao, too cowardly to look at her when he breaks her heart after her five years of loyalty to him. “This hand saved my life,” he tries to placate her, reaching out to hold her left-handed. “I’m not left-handed,” Qiao corrects, moving his hand to her right. “I shot the gun with my right hand.” The ensuing silence resonates louder than any gunshot ever could.
The two actors play beautifully off each other throughout the film, Zhao playing the despondent but resilient and ambitious Qiao to Liao’s more cold and distant Bin, but it is Zhao who rises as the film’s clear star. Her character’s transformation—from the faithful, loyal girl just wanting to buy her father a home, to the petty criminal who embodies the “jianghu” lifestyle she previously refused to adopt, and finally to the dominant woman who builds herself the empire Bin couldn’t hold on to—is one that could only be successfully performed by a masterful actress, which Zhao clearly proves herself to be. Zhangke must have had it easy directing Zhao—after all, it’s their eighth collaboration as a director-actress duo, and the two have been married since 2012. But no one can take away from Zhao’s acting. She towers over Bin’s rival gang members when they finally stop beating him, fearful of the power she holds as the smoke trails out of her gun’s barrel. She beats the woman who stole her money, after first beating the men harassing her, then cajoles a man into giving her stacks of cash. And in a scene towards the end of the film where Bin asks Qiao why she hasn’t married, Qiao remains silent, her answer implied in the stony expression on her face. The answer is sitting right next to her, but you can’t help but sit with in confusion as she grapples with her lingering love for the man who betrayed her.
In an attempt to put the past behind them, Bin makes one request of Qiao: “Let’s jump over a flame and chase away the bad luck.” They do, but the bad luck doesn’t really seem to go away for that long. All Qiao can do is hope that the grass will be greener on the other side—or in this case, that the ash will be whiter.

“Sextape”’s original French title, “A Genoux, Les Gars” roughly translates to “On Your Knees, Guys,” a phrase thrown in various iterations throughout the film at the protagonist, Yasmina (Souad Arsane) by her boyfriend-in-name, Salim (Sidi Mejai). Ironically enough, at the start of the movie, Yasmina has never even kissed a boy. She somehow can’t recognize an orgasm when she sees one, even when her older sister Rim (Inas Chanti)—the swan to Yasmina’s ugly duckling—fakes one à la Meg Ryan in the classic restaurant scene from “When Harry Met Sally…” As Rim’s moans get louder during the scene’s overused trope, Yasmina begs her to stop in a comical opener that bodes well for the rest of the movie (after all, too many films censor or misrepresent the sexual exploration of young women). Eventually, Rim “finishes,”—yes… Yes! YES!—but Yasmina still has a lot of questions: “Do I have to speak in English?” The film’s first few minutes hint at a coming-of-age (potentially romantic) comedy, but quickly crosses the line it barely tries to toe between the funny and the insensitive. In the #MeToo era, “Sextape” seems to promise a teenage anti-harassment story with a comedic spin, but too quickly spills into the disturbing by making light of a harrowing situation—based on true events no less, according to the film—that a few easy chuckles cannot make up for.
Rim decides to set Yasmina up with Salim, her boyfriend Majid’s (Mehdi Dahmane) best friend. The two share a first kiss in a swimming pool, hilariously interrupted by a young girl looking for playmates, but things quickly take a turn when Salim pressures Yasmina into giving him oral sex. In their own separate area, Majid tries to do the same with Rim, but where Rim refuses—she’s too much of a “feminist”—Yasmina reluctantly obliges, the first of many forced encounters she spends “On [Her] Knees.” Whereas Rim and Yasmina react differently to their respective boyfriend’s requests, Salim and Majid are in their words, “the same person,” two peas in a misogynistic pod, which is why when Rim goes away on a school trip, Salim manipulates and forces Yasmina into giving a drunken Majid oral sex to prevent him from cheating on her sister “in a moment of liberty, equality, and fraternity.” The best part? Salim films the entire encounter for his “own personal pleasure.” It comes as no surprise to anyone but Yasmina when Salim blackmails her into giving unlimited, buffet-style oral sex (his words, not mine) to him whenever he wants, presumably forever—or, as Yasmina negotiates, until February because then she has to study for her exams.
The film makes light of the entire situation—not to mention its other abounding homophobic and racist rhetoric—in a script that transcends farce into a thoughtless, offensive comedy. A collaborative effort co-written by the stars of the film, director Antoine Desrosières, and assistant director Anne-Sophie Nanki, the screenplay seeks to emulate the language of French youth both in reality and in the digital age. The actors speak in rapid-fire, caustic French, and along with their nearly incomprehensible text messages that appear as text on screen, their vocabulary recalls a particularly immature and condescending rather than realistic depiction of teenagerhood. An overworked attempt at humor, “Sextape” quickly takes what should be a hard-R rating and spills its impropriety into the film’s essence. By shirking away the potentially moralizing and prescriptive tone the movie could have taken, Desrosières goes too far and instead turns sexual assault into the punchline of a tasteless joke of a movie.
The film’s irredeemable downfall ensues from the cast’s lighthearted, inconsistent approach—to tone, to cinematography, to character growth—to depicting a truly horrific scenario. The dialogue ranges from purposefully chauvinist—”I kept it in the family!” is Majid’s defense for cheating and assaulting Yasmina when Rim finds out the truth—to maudlinly overserious to the point of nonsense: “You think you hate a thing, but it’s suffering.” The saturated colors meant to mirror the film’s raggedly playful tone contrast with Yasmina’s sullen, yellowed face, another in-your-face reminder of her misery in a world that simply does not care. The film tries to redeem itself by highlighting the love Yasmina and Rim have for each other as sisters who are “irreplaceable” to one another, but is too focused on its crassitude to truly develop their sisterhood, or even their characters. Rim, who prides herself on being a feminist by refusing to give Majid oral sex, proceeds to inadvertently slutshame her own sister when the latter tries to discreetly explain her predicament. To avenge Yasmina, they force Majid and Salim into an act of non-consensual oral sex before filming it and running away like two boys whose baseball fell onto the wrong yard. “Sextape” takes everything that needs to change about society’s devaluation and reduction of women to literal sextoys, and reinforces it in the failed comedy that it is—a stunning failure whose attempt to provoke brings its quality to its knees.

“Where’ll we be in 10 years?” Arthur asks his roommate. They’re standing in their darkened apartment in Bretagne, 1993. “I’ll be teaching at vocational high school,” his roommate replies pragmatically. “As for you, I don’t know.” There’s a pause, and then he concludes, “We’ll be nothing.”
That existential dread lingers in the margins of “Plaire, Aimer, et Courir Vite” (“Sorry Angel”), director Christophe Honoré’s queer love story, which premiered In Competition at the Cannes Film Festival. When writer Jacques Tondelli (Pierre Deladonchamps) walks into a movie theater on a break from a work engagement in Rennes, he meets Arthur (Vincent Lacoste), a charismatic 22-year-old figuring out his own identity. Their chemistry is immediate, their sparks flying. However, extenuating circumstances intervene: Arthur has an on-again, off-again relationship with his girlfriend, Nadine (Adèle Wismes), while Jacques is held emotionally responsible for not only a son, Loulou, but also an ex-boyfriend, Marco, who is succumbing to complications resulting from AIDS. Arthur and Jacques must learn to negotiate the terms of their love story, despite their circumstances and the limits on their time together.
Though at times self-indulgent and a bit pedantic, “Sorry Angel” manages to elude the pitfall of getting shelved into any one genre. It’s a love story and a bildungsroman, an AIDS tragedy that is still occasionally comical. Honoré’s delicate yet frank directorial eye traces over the nuances of what it meant to be a gay man in Paris in the wake of the AIDS epidemic, examining the thrill of new love when tempered with the threat of mortality.
The relationship between Jacques and Arthur is romantic, but also instructive: Arthur’s youth opposes 39-year-old Jacques’s jaded cynicism, while Jacques’s comparative years of experience and his time as a writer have given him experiences bad and good, which prove educational to naïve Arthur. The former is experienced compared to the latter, and Jacques has rules for everything, even a taxonomy of “four types of blonds”: The Maxim’s (ideal at first sight), the Whitman (a common bed-hopper), the Vondelpark (“a ’70s Nordic type, slightly corrupt, impassive air”), and the Wrong Blond (a reference to a W.H. Auden anecdote, in which Auden falls in love with Brooklyn student Walter Miller, but accidentally has a rendezvous with the wrong man). If these references are any indication of the cultural capital being traded in “Sorry Angel”—and they are—then it’s clear that the film indulges in its own intellectual impulses, sometimes almost to the point of pretension.
Yet innocent joy, the kind that comes with first loves, coexists alongside self-indulgence. Though Jacques and Arthur occupy the film’s central focus, Honoré does not neglect to turn his camera toward side characters, one of whom regularly steals the spotlight. Mathieu (Denis Podalyès), Jacques’s downstairs neighbor, forms the third point of Jacques and Arthur’s triumvirate—an older gay man whose gruff exterior belies an affectionate, amicable side, willing to tango-dance a choreographed routine with Arthur and lend Jacques his car in the middle of the night so he can visit Arthur in Rennes (even with a male escort waiting in bed!). Mathieu is the necessary anchor, tethering Jacques to reality while also giving him a safe place to land.
Honoré overlays the rest of the film with similarly tender moments, which are endearing, but cut with a painful edge of impending sorrow. The first night of the lovers’ introduction includes a series of confessional self-revelations to each other, despite their relative anonymity. “I’m a man who thinks he’s a boy,” Jacques introduces himself wryly, while Arthur earnestly says, “I’m too young to remember who I am.” There’s a particular tragedy in the abhorrent truth that the two men cross paths at inconvenient, or at least mismatching, points in their lives: While Arthur, who is only just discovering his sexuality, will have years to live, Jacques is counting the days until his illness worsens, the precariousness of his health and the hint of mortality looming like a sword of Damocles over their affair. Arthur gets to ask, “Where’ll we be in 10 years?” Jacques must contend with the reality of not having that time.
Occasionally, “Sorry Angel” toes the line between sweet and saccharine, between sob-worthy and sob-story—but by its final, heart-rending scene, Honoré has made the film’s artistic mission clear. Jacques and Arthur are two lovers, wrenched apart by time, anticipatorily star-crossed. It’s love with an expiration date—and that’s the truest tragedy of all.

Note: This review contains massive spoilers.
In “Unwomen,” Emily (Alexis Bledel) returns in the second episode of Season Two of “The Handmaid’s Tale” as an unwoman. Last we saw her, she had reached her breaking point: She was forced to undergo genital mutilation for illegally engaging in a lesbian relationship, and tasted a few seconds of freedom when she decided to drive an officer’s car. As punishment for her crimes, she is sent to the Colonies, a toxic waste zone where women lawbreakers are sent to work, presumably to death. As she slowly decomposes into a living corpse from the toxins—even the water is contaminated—the episode explores Emily’s story pre-Gilead through a series of flashbacks. The technique is overused, but that doesn’t make her journey any less harrowing.
“The Handmaid’s Tale” can’t lean on Margaret Atwood’s original text for its second season. But this presents an opportunity to explore what is only hinted at in the book. The threat of being sent to the Colonies was the worse alternative that the handmaids were constantly reminded of to keep them in check in the novel. But in Hulu’s adaptation, the threat becomes a reality. The unwomen, dressed in light blue, move waste during the day and wait to die during the night. Emily, who has become their de facto doctor, cares for them with the little resources available to her. “Best nail place in town,” one of them jokes when Emily advises her to air out her infected hands. “Give me a good review on Yelp,” Emily says, in a rare throwback to better days.
And they were better days, though Emily didn’t realize it at the time. We finally get to see who Emily was before June met her, and trace the origins of her lingering rebelliousness back to her days as a college biology professor seeking tenure. Unsurprisingly, she is just as intolerant of misogyny and homophobia as I expected her to be: She is quick to shut down a male student’s condescending remarks to another female student, and refuses to give up teaching when her boss tries to pressure her into being more discreet about her wife and son, something he too has been forced to do as a gay man. The scene speaks to one facet of the LGBTQ experience leading up the war that created Gilead. “I thought mine was the last generation that would have to deal with this bullshit. I thought all of you were all so spoiled,” he laments. “Not anymore,” Emily concludes. She’s right. Her boss is hanged at the university later on, with a homophobic slur spray-painted at his feet. It’s Emily’s signal to leave Boston as soon as possible.
The work Bledel does with just her eyes says more about how Gilead came to be than the new system itself. Initially hidden behind a pair of glasses, her crystal blue eyes come to life without them, resilient, pained, and—most of all—deceptive. The process begins at the airport, when Emily’s wife and son are forced to go to Canada without her, her marriage certificate no longer a valid substitute for a visa. As they walk away toward their gate, Emily tries to stay composed in light of the realization that this might be the last time she ever sees them. The melodramatic music cheapens the scene, but it cannot take away from Bledel’s acting: Her composed smile gives way to agony, and no pair of glasses can hide the terror in her eyes. It comes as no surprise, then, when she poisons the newest addition to the Colonies, a former Commander’s wife in an act of revenge. “Every month, you held a woman down while your husband raped her. Some things can't be forgiven,” she says to the dying unwoman. “You should die alone.”
Using the Boston Globe as a sanctuary, June also gets a glimpse at people’s pre-Gilead lives as she thumbs through the remnants of journalists’ abandoned desks. Her scenes are clearly filler—she makes a makeshift memorial for those slaughtered in the basement, tries and fails to escape north without Nick, and proceeds to have sex with him—but that’s okay. As the show branches away from June’s narrative, the new stories it will explore—Janine’s perhaps, considering she just got to the Colonies herself—hint at an exciting second season that will hopefully continue to include the experiences of people who weren’t directly connected to June before Gilead’s creation.

Note: This review contains massive spoilers.
In the third episode of its second season, “The Handmaid’s Tale” jumps forward two months in time. “Baggage” opens with shots of June (Elisabeth Moss) jogging around the unused printing presses of the former Boston Globe headquarters, which now serve as her hideout from the Gilead. The scene then cuts to Moira (Samira Wiley), who is June’s best friend, a former handmaid, and a current refugee living in Canada’s “Little America.” Miles away, Moira is also jogging, the exercise acting as some sort of invisible bond between the two friends as they try to piece together some sense of normalcy under strenuous conditions. This seems to be the narrative arc for Moira in “Baggage,” as she struggles to cope with the traumatic experiences Gilead inflicted upon her behind. But June isn’t there yet—she still has to get out of the country first.
Initially, an escape to Canada seems like the plan for June in “Baggage.” She hops into the back of someone’s truck, and later a plane. She stows away in a family’s home and disguises herself as one of the “econopeople,” presumably a working caste in which people are allowed to have their own families. She runs through the woods and a golden field, relentless in her escape to freedom. Throughout all these scenes are flashbacks to pre-Gilead days in typical “Handmaid’s Tale” style. This time, they all center around her relationship with her mother, Holly (Cherry Jones), who was a feminist, a fighter, and somehow always subtly disappointed in June, who did not take after her mother’s activist lifestyle.
June’s mother is another character the book does not necessarily touch on or flesh out, but her purpose in the Hulu adaptation is entirely warranted as it expands June’s character beyond the role of a narrator. After all, what better way to learn about someone than through their parents? Sure, there aren’t any embarrassing baby photos or home videos to be shared, but June’s story with her mother illustrates exactly why June is constantly teetering on the line of protest and passivity. The latter impulse is completely understandable considering the difficult circumstances, but the budding resistance we saw in June in the first season truly finds its driving force in “Baggage.” While waiting for someone to rescue her, June thinks about her training process as a handmaid. At one point in June’s memory, Aunt Lydia projects a picture of a woman working in the Colonies as a way to threaten the handmaids, who all know that the toxic wasteland is a death sentence. To June’s shock, the woman in the picture is her mother. “I told her it wasn’t safe, what she was doing… She knew,” June whispers to Moira. “Moira, she always knew.” Moira tries to comfort June, telling her that a life in the Colonies is a short one at the very least. “Not for her,” June says. “You know she’ll fight like hell.”
The show then cuts to the present, where June rolls marbles in the palms of her hands. Her face hardens into resolve. “I waited before. I thought things might be okay,” June thinks. “I swore I’d never do that again.” The music shudders, wails, and June springs into action, concocting a plan that will hopefully get her far away from Gilead. “Baggage” finds its heart in this scene, which is overtly dramatic, with the music pulsing and the camera shaking, but appropriately so. June musters more bravery than imaginable, making her character all the more impressive. She spins around in the woods, trying to grapple with the idea of leaving her daughter, Hannah, behind. Eventually, June finally makes it to the final leg of her trip, and sits in a plane with so much grief, guilt, and hope on her face—a beautiful example of Moss’s layered acting.
But “Baggage” is here for more than just mere plot progression—which is good, considering June’s journey meets a tragic end. She’s pulled out of the plane by the Gilead police, as she screams and claws at the sides of the door. “The Handmaid’s Tale” isn’t done with Gilead just yet, but the surprisingly artful dramatics and clever character exploration hint at equally interesting world expansions to come.

Harvard is “investigating” after a student found a swastika posted on a billboard in the School of Public Health Thursday.
The symbol was formed of thumb tacks and posted on a bulletin board marketing epidemiology job postings on the fifth floor of the school’s Kresge Building. Administrators have not yet identified the perpetrator, according to a statement Dean Michele A. Williams sent Thursday to school affiliates outlining the school’s response.
Williams wrote in the statement that School of Public Health administrators are deeply disturbed by the discovery of the swastika.
“We are shocked and outraged to have seen such a symbol of hatred within our own building. The symbol has been removed and we are investigating to determine whether it is possible to identify the perpetrator,” she wrote.
Williams also asked Meredith Rosenthal, senior associate dean for academic affairs, to host a gathering this afternoon to discuss the incident. Roughly 100 people attended the meeting, according to Rosenthal.
“At a school of public health, we’re committed to social justice and inclusion,” she said. “Nothing could be further from our values from the hate, anti-Semitism, as well as white supremacy that is associated with the swastika.”
Rosenthal also said the incident will inform future discussions at the school surrounding diversity and inclusion.
“The key theme is that we need to continue to have these difficult conversations and not paper over what may be underlying issues that are essentially silenced in our community.”
Laura Rapoport, president of the school’s Jewish Student Association, wrote in an email that the symbol’s placement has detrimentally affected students.
“My fellow students feel hurt and frightened by this event, not even a month after the school commemorated Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day,” she wrote.
The incident was referred to the Harvard University Police Department, according to spokespeople for the School of Public Health and HUPD. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the investigation, citing the department’s long-standing policy of not commenting on open cases.
The swastika incident comes shortly after a Harvard employee gave a performance in Sanders Theatre May 2 in which he stripped to the nude and made anti-Semitic comments. Harvard is currently “reviewing” that performance.

University President Drew G. Faust earned over $1.5 million in compensation in 2016, an increase from the $1.4 million she earned in 2015 and $1.2 million she earned in 2014.
Faust’s 2016 earnings include $905,461 in base salary, $189,982 in nontaxable benefits, $4,217 in other reportable compensation, and $400,000 in deferred compensation. Members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing board—vote annually to determine the amount of deferred compensation that Faust will receive. In 2016, the Corporation voted to credit Faust with $400,000, upping the $300,000 credited to her in 2015 and bringing her total retirement and deferred compensation assets to $433,825 for the year.
Faust will step down as president in June, and Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow will take her place.
The Internal Revenue Service requires the University to annually submit the Form 990 tax filings as a non-profit organization, making some University financial information—such as the earnings of chief University officers—public.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, who is stepping down at the end of the year, made $701,956 in total salary and benefits in 2016, while Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 made $871,960.
The deans of the Business School and the Medical School were the most highly paid deans across the University in 2016. Business School Dean Nitin Nohria made $800,052 in 2016.
Former Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier, who stepped down in July 2016, made $680,589 in total salary and benefits while his temporary replacement Barbara J. McNeil made $456,026 as acting Medical School dean.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, who oversees the University’s Allston operations, made $736,647 in total salary and benefits in 2016. In January, the University pledged to contribute $50 million to fund the construction of West Station.
Similar to 2015, the three of the highest earning faculty in 2016 all hail from the Business School and earned at least $1 million in total salary and compensation.
However, the salaries of employees at Harvard Management Company—stewards of the University’s $37.1 billion endowment—far outpaced the earnings University administrators and faculty alike.
Former HMC Chief Executive Stephen J. Blythe, who resigned in July 2016, earned $6,768,888 in 2016. Daniel Cummings, who was hired in 2009 to manage the University’s real estate investments, earned $23,853,527— more than 20 times more than Faust’s salary—in 2016. To calculate salaries, HMC assigns bonus compensation according to the success of asset class performance, which likely contributed to Cumming’s high salary.
Last February, HMC spun off its real estate team to Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital, where Cummings will continue to manage the Harvard portfolio.
However, HMC Chief Executive N.P. “Narv” Narvekar announced in January 2017 that HMC has decided to discontinue this bonus compensation structure effective in fiscal year 2018, according to a HMC press release Friday. Instead, salary bonuses will be calculated by the performance of the overall endowment, not by asset class.
“An important part of the new investment model is building a compensation framework that fully aligns the generalist investment team with the performance of the overall endowment,” University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan wrote in a statement. “This collaborative approach will further enhance HMC’s focus on generating long-term returns to support Harvard’s teaching and research mission”
