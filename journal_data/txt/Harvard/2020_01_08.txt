After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Warning: some spoilers ahead.
“Knives Out” evokes memories of Agatha Christie novels: a small cast of characters, all of whom know each other, and all of whom could have committed the crime; multiple petty squabbles; and one charmingly-accented detective. The difference, however, is that “Knives Out” takes place in this century — which means that it contains nuggets of political themes — and Daniel Craig, in the role of intrepid detective Benoit Blanc, has a Southern accent that is surprisingly well-done.
A brief plot summary: Harlan Thrombey dies just after his 85th birthday in an apparent suicide. The cops show up with Craig in tow, and soon he starts asking questions. The audience sees the story via a series of flashbacks, and it soon becomes clear that everyone resented the old man for one reason or another: A son-in-law was going to be blackmailed for an affair, a daughter-in-law saw the loss of financial support, and Thrombey’s own son was fired from the family publishing company. And of course, there’s Marta, the nurse born from a Spanish-speaking country that the family refuses to correctly name, who was Thrombey’s confidante, and who was ignored until the family stands to lose the money they thought was theirs: Thrombey left his entire will and estate to her.
As a result, the film soon becomes a tale deeply concerned with immigration and how it interfaces with the concepts of belonging and worthiness. It goes without saying that all of Thrombey’s family — every one of whom is white — think they deserve the patriarch’s estate and assets, despite the will’s clear statement to the contrary. Turning on Marta for her apparent scheming to take the money all along is their predictable reaction.
The family relies on the status quo being rigged in their favor, that they will win — because they can, and will, mobilize an army of lawyers and experts to strip Marta of what is rightfully hers. It is not surprising, in their attempts at coercion before resorting to uglier tactics, that the family members threaten to out her mother to the authorities, or use Marta’s own immigrant status against her.
What makes the back-and-forth between Marta and the Thrombey family all the more biting — and thus makes it cultural commentary — is that many of them see themselves as progressive and open-minded. These are the people who profess support for liberal issues while quietly, behind closed doors, express opinions that actively hurt the communities and people they seemingly care about. They desire progress as long as it remains comfortable.
“Knives Out” is so interesting to watch because it shows how ugly things get when the seemingly progressive have to begin to relinquish the power they say they don’t want. The march towards equality suddenly isn’t as shiny and desirable when it requires one’s own sacrifice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions sent a letter to the First Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday asking for the release of a briefing schedule in the appeal of its ongoing lawsuit against Harvard.
A briefing schedule would outline the dates when the two parties must submit opening, response, and reply briefs summarizing the reasons for or against an appeal.
SFFA’s lawsuit, filed in 2014, alleges that the College unlawfully discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. After a three week trial in 2018 in Massachusetts District Court, Judge Alison D. Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard on all counts on Oct. 1, 2019.
SFFA filed its notice of appeal on Oct. 4, and the Court docketed the case on Oct. 11.
The letter — authored by SFFA lawyer William S. Consovoy and addressed to Maria R. Hamilton, the clerk of the First Circuit Court of Appeals — cited the “nearly three months” that have passed since the court last moved the case forward.
“Although SFFA understands the many demands on this Court’s time, it respectfully asks for a briefing schedule as expeditiously as possible,” Consovoy wrote.
Edward J. Blum, the founder and president of SFFA, called the length of time that has elapsed without a briefing schedule “very disconcerting.”
“Nearly 13 weeks after the district court’s ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has failed to establish a calendar so that Students for Fair Admissions rightfully can pursue its appeal,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “This is very disconcerting.”
Susan J. Goldberg, the Circuit Executive for the First Circuit Court of Appeals, confirmed that the court received the letter and that the Clerk’s Office will handle SFFA’s request but declined to comment further.
In the letter, Consovoy also cited the case’s national significance as a reason for requesting an expedited timeline. Some experts have said that, if the Supreme Court hears the case upon further appeal, it could determine the fate of race-conscious admissions at private colleges and universities across the country.
“This case involves issues of national importance regarding the legality of Harvard’s use of race in college admissions,” Consovoy wrote. “Given its importance, the length of time since this case was filed, and the likelihood that whoever loses will seek further review, SFFA would greatly appreciate a briefing schedule so it can begin vindicating its rights on appeal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a week after ending their month-long strike, members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers said they are divided over the decision to return to work on Jan. 1.
After four weeks of picketing and “virtual striking,” members of the bargaining committee announced their decision to end the strike Dec. 30.
“We on the bargaining committee have decided that student workers will end our strike and return to work on January 1,” the HGSU-UAW bargaining committee members wrote in an email to union members.
Over the course of the strike, the union and the University had just one bargaining session. They reached six new contract agreements, and the University committed to introducing federal mediators into the next bargaining session on Jan. 7.
Anthropology Ph.D. student Aparna Gopalan — who said she “picketed, flyered, provided testimonials, and was active online” throughout the strike — wrote in an email she was “surprised” by the bargaining committee’s decision to end the strike when they did.
“I felt like the momentum was on our side, so I was surprised at the decision to end to strike on Jan 1,” Gopalan wrote in an email. “I don't really understand what pressures led the Union to make this somewhat abrupt announcement, and I wonder if there could have been a more 'democratic' way to decide to suspend the strike such as a vote of some sort.”
Members of the bargaining committee did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Gopalan wrote that, while she understood some potential reasons for bringing the strike to a close, it felt “jarring” to return to work without a contract.
“While I get some of the reasons for ending the strike on Jan 1, not the least the toll sustaining it would have taken on core organizers, I wish that we'd been able to anticipate that the strike would end up mainly serving to win mediation rather than an outright contract,” she wrote. “It's been a bit jarring to go from being on strike to not being on strike but without having won the contract we fought for.”
Others, like Linguistics Ph.D. student Ethan G. Wilcox, said they agreed with the bargaining committee’s decision to end the strike before the second semester begins.
“I think it was the right decision,” Wilcox wrote in an email. “Grad students in the linguistics department (where I work) were nervous about not getting paid come the new semester, and the administration showed a significant change in commitment by agreeing to 6 new portions of the contract as well as bringing in a federal mediator.”
Bronwyn A. Isaacs, who completed her Ph.D. in Anthropology this semester, said she thought the end of the strike was “good news.”
"The fact that the graduate workers had been able to negotiate small but real steps in terms of the administration coming around and saying that they'd be willing to work on creating a contract, that was a very meaningful gain,” Isaacs said.
Alexis Turner — a History of Science Ph.D. student — expressed a similar sentiment, citing the decision to engage federal mediators as a sign the University intends to expedite contract negotiations. In their email announcing the decision to end the strike, HGSU-UAW members cited the decision to bring in mediators as one of several reasons to end the strike.
“Nobody is ever particularly happy about the need to strike, and I believe that Harvard's move to work with a labor dispute mediator was one of the first clearly good faith efforts on their part to move forward,” Turner wrote. “I'm tentatively encouraged by this first step to getting back to the table.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on union members’ criticisms.
Even student workers jarred by the decision said they believe the strike had positive outcomes. Gopalan wrote that the month-long effort publicized graduate students’ work and brought them together across departments.
“The main gain from the strike seems to be a really strong sense of solidarity amongst graduate students and other workers, and better awareness all around about the anti-student worker way in which institutions like Harvard have been functioning,” Gopalan wrote. “Another really important gain has been to put the memo out there that graduate students are workers; this alone will make many of our lives easier as we navigate supervisors, departments, and students.”
Wilcox also wrote that the strike showed that graduate students identify as workers.
“We have class consciousness!” he wrote. “By striking we solidified that identity individually and collectively.”
Gopalan said she thinks that future labor actions on HGSU-UAW’s part may be necessary before the group reaches a satisfactory contract agreement.
“In general I don't see them breaking radically from their increasingly corporate mindset and becoming an employee-first kind of place, and that's ultimately what we are asking for,” Gopalan wrote. “Strikes are and should be seen as normal exercises of collective power, not aberrant events that we hope will never happen again.”
Others, like Turner, said they are less enthusiastic about the prospect of another strike.
“Let's hope not,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard, its graduate student union, and federal mediators failed to reach an agreement on a contract Tuesday in their first negotiation session since the union ended its month-long strike.
University spokesman Jonathan L. Swain confirmed in an emailed statement that the mediator held individual meetings with both parties, in addition to the group session, to better understand major sticking points in the negotiations. He added that the two parties have scheduled additional negotiation sessions for Jan. 17 and Jan. 23.
This first meeting of the new year comes one week after the conclusion of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ 28-day strike, the longest graduate student strike in recent history.
The Union and the University agreed to six tentative provisions during their last bargaining session, held Dec. 18. But those agreements did not include any related to the three major contract provisions that prompted the union’s strike: compensation, healthcare, and grievance procedures to adjudicate claims of sexual harassment and discrimination.
Multiple HGSU-UAW bargaining committee members declined to comment as they left Tuesday’s session.
The bargaining committee noted in a Dec. 31 email announcing the strike’s end that they believe administrators showed a commitment to reaching a contract in a timely manner.
“We now expect the administration to put all their energy into reaching a fair agreement,” the committee said.
The contract provisions HGSU-UAW demanded include increased compensation for student workers, more health benefits, and the implementation of sexual harassment and discrimination grievance procedures.
The bargaining committee cited the University’s Dec. 19 proposal to recruit federal mediators in the negotiation process in their email announcing that the strike would end in the new year. They characterized the development as a victory for student workers.

Astronomers at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study have discovered a massive wave of stellar nurseries located near the sun through research incorporating data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission.
The study — conducted by a team which included five astronomers from Harvard — introduced a collection of gas named the “Radcliffe Wave,” one of the largest coherent gaseous structures ever observed in the Milky Way.
The findings dispute the 150-year-old “Gould’s Belt” theory that nearby stellar nurseries — areas of gas and dust where new stars are formed — exist in a ring around the sun. The Radcliffe Wave, which has a straight, sinusoidal structure, contains stellar nurseries originally believed to be part of Gould’s Belt, disproving the previous theory that they form a ring.
Astronomy professor Alyssa A. Goodman, a member of the research team who serves as co-director for science at Radcliffe, said in a press release that she found the findings surprising.
“No astronomer expected that we live next to a giant, wave-like collection of gas – or that it forms the Local Arm of the Milky Way,” Goodman said. “We were completely shocked when we first realized how long and straight the Radcliffe Wave is, looking down on it from above in 3D – but how sinusoidal it is when viewed from Earth.”
The team’s original intention was not to discover the Radcliffe Wave, but to create an accurate three-dimensional representation of stellar nurseries in the galaxy using data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, according to team member and Astronomy Ph.D. candidate Catherine Zucker.
The research also suggested that the sun has been very close to the Radcliffe Wave for millions of years, and that it may cross through the wave in the future.
“The impact this would have on our solar system is probably minimal, but we can't say for sure,” Zucker wrote.
The team hopes to expand its research to understand how the Radcliffe Wave came into existence and discover whether similar structures exist in the universe.
“We want to understand the origins of this structure, to figure out how it formed,” Zucker wrote. “The waviness implies that there is some sort of collision event, perhaps between the disk of our Galaxy, and another less massive object (like a dwarf galaxy). But there are many other scenarios.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tom’s BaoBao — the fast-casual restaurant serving baozi, or Chinese steamed buns, on Winthrop Street — has closed its doors after more than three years of business on Harvard Square.
Tom’s BaoBao opened its first United States location in Cambridge in June 2016 and is a part of the bao-making chain Ganqishi, which has more than 200 locations in China. Serving a mix of meat and vegetarian buns, Tom’s BaoBao billed itself as the only authentic baozi restaurant in the Boston area, according to COO Rosamond Lu.
Lu said the restaurant departed from Cambridge for a “combination of personal and business reasons.” Lu saw an opportunity to spend more time with her family as the reality of running a business in Harvard Square became increasingly challenging.
“It's just a difficult time and place to run a small restaurant,” she said. “Brick and mortar stores, especially small businesses and restaurants and retailers particularly, are under a lot of pressure for very high rent and high personnel costs.”
Lu’s struggle to keep up with the high cost of doing business in Harvard Square is not unique. From local shops like Black Ink and Out of Town News to brand names like Urban Outfitters and Chipotle, businesses in the square have closed their doors amidst increasing rent and the advent of online shopping.
“I think [Tom’s BaoBao’s closing] is part of a bigger issue which is that we need more foot traffic in Harvard Square,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “When you have a high percentage of sales that are happening online, not only in retail sales but even food sales, where people are ordering from GrubHub and UberEats and so forth, it makes a difference.”
“It adds to challenge of businesses striving to be successful in the 21st century retail environment,” she added.
Lu added that mobile food-delivery apps have become the norm, especially for fast-casual locations like Tom’s BaoBao.
“The consumers don't always know about this, but when you're not buying direct from the restaurants, the restaurants have to pay very hefty fees to whoever you're ordering from,” Lu said. “It basically wipes out all the profits. And because everyone expects their food delivered, you kind of have to be on all these platforms, and it just adds more pressure to the business.”
Throughout its tenure in Harvard Square, Tom’s BaoBao stayed committed to fresh ingredients and authenticity, even sending its staff to China to master the art of making bao, according to Jillson and Lu.
Lu said some customers told her that they were reminded of their grandmother’s cooking when eating the bao. She said the “encouraging” environment helped as she grew restaurant’s team — many of whom were refugees and new immigrants to the country.
“They see how welcoming the customers in Harvard Square are, and I think it's encouraging for them,” Lu said.
While Tom’s BaoBao exits Harvard Square, the question of how local businesses can survive in Harvard Square remains. Jillson said she is faced with the challenge of finding yet another business that might breathe life back into the square in the wake of sky-high rent and dwindling foot traffic.
“If people don't change their habits and people don't walk the streets of Harvard Square poking in and out of the stores and seeing what's available, then you wonder, would it matter, does it matter, how much does it matter what the next business will be?” she asked. “Will it encounter the same outcome?”
