After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dawn M. Simmons, Co-Producing Artistic Director of Front Porch Arts Collective, sat down in an interview with The Harvard Crimson to discuss her passionate and poetic approach to her work, particularly regarding “K-I-S-S-I-N-G,” the coming-of-age play she directs, currently running at The Huntington's Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA (527 Tremont St.) until April 2.
“I am a director, playwright, movement enthusiast,” she said. “I am a world builder, a creator, and a dreamer.”
Through theater, Simmons aims to create joy and wonder, highlight Black stories and artists, and bring imagination to communities. As director of the coming-of-age play “K-I-S-S-I-N-G,” she succeeds in all three of those endeavors.
“K-I-S-S-I-N-G” tells the story of Lala, a teenage girl who grows into her identity, discovering herself as an artist while navigating love and lust for the first time.
“It’s romantic, it’s warm, it’s funny,” Simmons said. “You will laugh. Everybody deserves a break; everybody deserves to laugh. There’s joy in coming to see this.”
The play is a joint effort between Front Porch Arts Collective, a Black theater company in Boston, and The Huntington, Boston’s leading professional theater company founded in 1982.
Simmons co-founded Front Porch Arts Collective because she set a goal to form a “thriving Black theater company in Boston” that would continue for decades beyond her involvement. She wanted to create more employment opportunities for Black artists in Boston, a city she loves, and while also creating a space to tell more Black stories without “waiting for Black History Month.”
“We wanted to create another space where Black stories could be told, where artists of the diaspora could have work, work that paid well, where we could be the decision-makers,” she said.
When playwright Lenelle Moïse was in residence at The Huntington, the company sought the right partner to co-produce “K-I-S-S-I-N-G.” Front Porch Arts Collective was clearly a suitable option. Upon reading the play, Simmons loved its fun language and its humor. She found the play “beautiful, lyrical, poetic, imaginative, queer,” and she knew immediately that she wanted — needed — to bring it to life.
The play suits her broader objectives as a theatermaker. Through her work, Simmons seeks to reach audiences’ emotions and imaginations by harmonizing the fanciful with the quotidian, the grandiose with the simple.
“How do I create joy, how do I create wonder, how do I bring excitement into the world; how do I make people think about the mundane, the everyday?” She asked. “But also how do I make that epic? Even in its smallness.”
While Directing “K-I-S-S-I-N-G,” Simmons strives to highlight Black joy, and to highlight the story of a young Black woman discovering herself and her own wants and needs.
In pursuit of these goals, she drew inspiration from “everywhere,” including every person involved in creating the show, ’80s, ’90s, and early 2000s teenage romantic comedies, fine art, and music.
“Music played every day at the beginning of our process,” she said. “We would have a song of the day. A quote from a poet, a movie, or a writer — somebody that we would call our ‘patron saint.’”
It is apparent that visual art and music influenced the production. Captivating audiovisual elements (including stunning artistic projections and carefully-selected contemporary music) enhance the show’s creativity and vibrancy, immersing audiences in “K-I-S-S-I-N-G”’s youthful and playful world.
According to Simmons, it was challenging to bring all of the technical elements together. She wanted to create an effect, in Moïse’s words, that the audience is “seeing [Lala’s] artistry grow before you.” Simmons described the process as “really hard and really exciting,” and she acknowledged the outstanding work of the production team that made it possible.
The opening scene presented another challenge, as it is starkly different from the rest of the play. Handling difficult themes, particularly postpartum depression, Simmons remained cognizant of the ways the scene may have impacted the actors and the serious conversations necessary to create an appropriate rehearsal process.
“How do you embody [postpartum depression] and let that emotion go?” she said. “That’s been one of the harder challenges in a play that is so joyful.”
According to Simmons, she and the cast used their important, off-stage conversations “to fuel the story.” Their mindfulness and care in approaching the heavy topic resulted in a poignant, powerfully heartbreaking first scene, which framed the lighthearted play with deeper context.
This side of Simmons’s process in developing “K-I-S-S-I-N-G” lends itself to the complexity in her approach to theater-making. Simmons embraces imagination and joy, but even further, she embraces emotional healing. To Simmons, art is essential to human well-being; it is “as necessary as oxygen.”
“I don’t know if we [as a nation] see how cathartic art can be. I don’t know if we understand its healing property,” she said. “It helps us process. It helps with our emotional health. Our well-being keeps our imagination going.”
Simmons brings that healing quality to the stage in “K-I-S-S-I-N-G,” through both gleeful and sensitive moments. The play is delightful and fresh. Most importantly, it encapsulates all of the ideals Simmons aims to include in her world-building.
You can see The Huntington’s and Front Porch Art Collective’s production of “K-I-S-S-I-N-G” at The Huntington's Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA (527 Tremont St.) through April 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Benjamin Benne’s “Alma” is a classic drama of the immigrant family with a nod to the mystical. Directed by Elena Velasco, Central Square Theater’s production runs through March 26.
Set at the dawn of the Trump era, “Alma” recounts the story of mother and daughter Alma and Angel as they argue the night before Angel’s SAT. Alma immigrated to California while pregnant with Angel and promised to make all of her daughter’s dreams come true — but Angel’s dreams were really Alma’s dreams. With the election of Donald Trump, Alma is threatened with the increased threat of deportation. The play explores that imminent risk and the indirect way it causes tension in the home.
Although “Alma” opens with a mystical dramatization of the mother-daughter bond and contains mystical happenings throughout, the bulk of the play follows a predictable drama between immigrant mother and naturalized daughter in the United States. Angel corrects her mother’s English, and Alma reprimands her daughter for eating Hot Cheetos instead of the rice and beans she made for her. Angel wants to be a zoologist; Alma wants her to be a doctor. The two characters trade this typical back and forth dialogue for an hour, leaving the audience longing for something more.
Karina Beleno Carney (“Alma”) keeps the audience engaged by committing to her physical performance. Carney runs, jumps, and dances across the stage for the hour-long family feud, often spouting her lines out of breath or from the floor.
Playing the immigrant mother masterfully, Carney performs well-executed Mexican household Spanglish throughout the show. This element was essential to the play’s authenticity, overseen by dialect coach Cristhian Mancinas-García. Carney’s mastery of the language was enhanced not just by the words she said but also the words she omitted, calling a drawer, glass, or refrigerator the “thingy” for her lack of English fluency.
Luz Lopez (“Angel”) embraces the challenging role of rebellious daughter, expressing love and hate at the same time. While the script was jarring, throwing Angel at odds with her mother at one moment and begging Alma to sing a song the next, Lopez eases the transitions for a compelling portrayal of an emotional teenager. Even the typical and disappointing reveal of Angel’s secret midway through the show is alleviated by Lopez’s believable delivery. Both Carney and Lopez divert attention away from a stereotypical script into a heartfelt and emotive experience of mother and daughter.
“Alma,” however, cannot be dismissed as a typical immigrant drama because of its hints at magical elements. The TV repeatedly turns on to Trump election coverage without the touch of the remote, the power goes out at the peak of the play, and the stage splits in half as Alma and Angel consider the possibility of separation in the coming years. Director Elena Velasco succeeded in centering these metaphysical elements of the play from the outset.
Lighting designer Andrea Sofia Sala created multiple environments and effects in one space. The stage was covered in lights to reflect Alma’s immigration story and her strange dream at the end of the play. Alma and Angel initiate the drama in a ritualistic breath procession, illuminated only by the superficial starry night. Sala and Velasco emphasize this scene with the dynamic lighting of the stage and the slow pace of the actors’ entrances. While the play may have been improved with a deeper embrace of the supernatural elements to divert from the predictability of the plot, Sala and Velasco made these few moments visually pop.
Central Square Theater’s production of “Alma” brings an instantly recognizable immigrant story to the stage in a real-time family drama. While the plot is driven by sometimes stereotypical dialogue, the true events of the story are a moving reminder of the hardship of immigrant life in the United States. “Alma” is a story as important now as it was back in its 2016 setting.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Christopher L. Rivers ’24 strode into the Quincy dining hall, emanating the frenzied and fatigued aura that accompanies his mid-semester life. A bright yellow bomber jacket dominated his look, immediately giving him a playful and lighthearted appearance upon first impression.
Under this friendly, laid-back, and almost cartoonish exterior, few people would expect to find years of hard work, dedication, and passion for theater.
A musical theater performer turned theater technician, Rivers began his theater journey in high school, singing in his school’s musicals. He remembers his first solo in his sophomore year of high school in the musical “Children of Eden.”
“Not to sound super self-absorbed, but it felt really nice getting an applause,” he said.
He laughs at himself, saying that he didn’t want to sound like a peaked in high school “type of guy.”
Despite his jest, Rivers spoke earnestly of his love for the people in the show and the feeling that came with his ability to communicate with the audience from the stage.
This dual-tone pattern was consistent throughout most of our conversation; Rivers alternated between humorous self-deprecation and sincere passion for his work.
His involvement in musical theater continued briefly into college, although it was greatly changed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Like all classes and most extracurricular activities on Harvard’s campus in the 2020-21 year, his performance took place over Zoom.
After that year, Rivers moved away from musical theater and became involved in technical theater. While he still loves singing, he’s found a love for problem-solving and set-building through technical theater. When he said that seeing the final product of his hard work is “really special,” he smiled.
When I asked him if he misses anything about singing in musicals, he chuckled, jokingly admitting, “Yeah, I love attention.” Then, he quickly flipped back to genuine sincerity.
“No, in all seriousness, I love to sing as well,” he said. “It's something I think about sometimes.”
He notes that technical theater has its drawbacks. He mentioned that it can be a thankless place at times, but he assured me that he is not bitter despite his love for attention. Theater also requires a massive time commitment on his part. As a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Rivers and the rest of the tech crew returned to campus on Jan 9., two weeks before classes began.
In response to a question about how he balances school and theater, Rivers paused and then grinned, embracing both his playfulness and his earnesty.
“Um, poorly, I guess, would be the straight answer,” he said.
In addition to working over winter break, Rivers described his typical daily routine during the fall 2022 semester.
“My days usually ended up being like, go to class, work on theater stuff, go to sleep,” he said.
Eat, sleep, tech, repeat.
As a physics and philosophy concentrator, Rivers normally does research, though he has chosen to focus only on theater and school this semester. Despite the expected contrast between his academic and extracurricular interests, Rivers does not see any tension between the two.
“Honestly it’s the opposite. Those two things are kind of independent of each other,” Rivers said. “And I'm actually really grateful that I'm able to do both. There's not a lot of overlap, but, I don't know, I think it's honestly super lucky that I even am able to.”
It’s clear that Rivers also feels very fortunate to be part of the Hasty Pudding, describing the community and people as “super phenomenal.”
“We’re all a bunch of people who have the common goal of putting on this fun little comedy,” he said.
Due to the amount of time he spends on Pudding shows, he becomes close to the people he works with, as the club is also a social group. The community that theater provides isn’t unique to the Pudding, and it is something that has always drawn Rivers to theater.
Rivers is currently busy with a show for the Pudding, “Cosmic Relief!,” working “basically all day, every day.”
He clearly puts a lot of effort and passion into his shows, but he still managed to get in a funny, self-deprecating remark.
“There are a lot of people who are much better organized and much better than me at this,” Rivers said.
Though he constantly laughs at his involvement in theater, it is clear it is a serious interest of his. After graduation, he hopes to continue to pursue theater in his professional life.
“Not to philosophize about life,” he said, “but, ideally, I would love to work at what I love.”
“My post grad plans right now, if I could do anything, I would love to get an apprenticeship in theater carpentry,” he said. “And just kind of see where that goes. I just, I enjoy it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are several things that make the Harvard Science and Engineering Complex’s design perplexing. Its location in Allston was historically low-lying marshland that experienced continual nuisance flooding. Even as the SEC’s landscape was designed to mitigate flooding, it has two lower levels of basement.
The SEC’s theoretical grandeur is inhibited by its physical reality. And not just when the water comes rising.
The SEC was a large part of why I quit engineering. The 20 minutes or so I spent each way on the crowded Allston Loop shuttle was often rife with anxiety. Classes in the SEC spelled the terminus of my productivity. Its broad open spaces — noises precipitating from several floors above, nothing separating you from the views of passers-by — made it impossible to focus in the building. Messing with few-and-far-between outlets under heavy metal drain holes in “flat flexible” classrooms interrupted the smooth flow of my work.
The multilevel bee-hive atrium, labs and offices generically sectioned off by green curtains, and a floorplan that made no sense to me created a space that felt as impersonal as my relationship with the engineering and applied sciences departments’ advisers. By the end of the semester, I’d stopped going to class altogether.
The “shimmering second skin” on the exterior grated at my eyes. The subterranean outdoor courtyard intended as a study space always had its doors locked when I checked. The grand atrium resembles a panopticon, a place where someone at the top could see into every balcony. In the SEC, I always felt alone and surveilled.
The SEC cost about $1 billion to build. Tuft’s Science and Engineering Complex, which opened in 2017, cost $110 million. But what can you get at these sky-high prices?
These buildings share huge budgets, huge square footage, and a claim to sustainability and community focus. But mostly, they signal a commitment to research without specificity.
The SEC has been named one of the most sustainable, energy-efficient labs in the world. But in my observations, it also contains a lot of glass, which is generally not very energy efficient. With equivalent insulating power to just a couple sheets of cardboard, large amounts of glass cause buildings to overheat in the summertime and cool to uncomfortable temperatures in the winter.
Glass spaces are also uncomfortable on a psychological level. People who live in glass spaces tend to disguise it first: The majority of people living in glass towers keep their shades down. Enter the SEC, and you’ll see many of the green curtain partitions outside of labs closed — hardly an effective way to bring the outside in.
On a human level, the glass box, no matter how functional or innovative, causes stress. Glass has no strong visual properties of its own; it is a transparent, generalized material that dully follows its surroundings. In a study by psychologist Colin Ellard, people’s level of stress rose dramatically when walking past boring, generic buildings, as compared to visually distinctive ones. Glass, a material so bland you sometimes don’t even realize it’s there, is undoubtedly boring.
There are things architects can do to make glass less energy inefficient — like triple-glazing (and the builders of SEC did do it!). But they can’t make glass any less glass, with its uncomfortable psychological impacts on human inhabitants.
The layout of schools can affect childrens’ rate of learning by 25 percent — either positively or negatively — each year. This makes it even more important that Harvard, first and foremost an educational institution, keeps design elements central in mind when renovating and building spaces for students to learn and live in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I heard the news that the former president of Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative transferred $30,000 from the club’s bank account to her own, I laughed. $30,000 seems like an astronomical amount of money for a single individual to access in an instant. With that amount of money, an undergraduate could buy enough takeout ramen, burritos, and iced vanilla lattes to fuel all four years at Harvard.
But, putting tasty snacks aside, $30,000 is equivalent to the annual income of a family of four living at the national poverty line. With this realization, my laughter faltered.
I go to a school where a teenager or twenty-something year-old can unilaterally control more money than some families see in an entire year.
Most Harvard students will argue that the HUFPI situation is atypical. Only some student organizations have as much money or power as HUFPI, and the optimistic undergraduate might even argue that their peers could handle such responsibility. But while these points might be true to an extent, the existence of even a single story like this illustrates an important reality about the culture of student organizations at Harvard: They’re usually centered around control.
Even though we don’t like directly recognizing it, this theme comes up often in high-profile on-campus news events and whispered gossip. After the Undergraduate Council was defunded amid allegations of financial irresponsibility, the Harvard Undergraduate Association proposed an (ultimately unsuccessful) amendment to its constitution so that the position of “Co-President” would be renamed “Co-Coordinator.” This move was apparently made to reduce the prestige associated with the role and select individuals motivated by passion rather than aspirations of a career in government.
Besides this well-publicized example, many of my friends have complained to me about leadership issues in their clubs. A classmate told me that one of their collaborators refused to share the login to a club’s bank account, preventing them from planning essential events. Another peer told me their club suddenly instituted a hierarchical leadership structure after years of being unstructured.
The common thread here is that many Harvard students want to be in control of their clubs, even if they don’t want to admit it. Maybe you have an impulse to point fingers at the megalomaniacs engaging in hostile takeovers and controlling leaders monopolizing power, but I would bet that doing so would lead you to run out of fingers pretty quickly.
Besides, this ignores the issue at the heart of this story: Harvard doesn’t inherently have too many students pursuing power over passion. Rather, the University is  a breeding ground for this kind of mentality.
Extracurriculars aren’t treated as a reprieve from the day-to-day stressors of being a college student. Instead, time outside of class is measured in bullet points on a resume. Participation in a student organization must have tangible benefits, whether those be building a useful network, developing pre-professional skills, or beefing up a CV. This mindset creates a culture where control and “leadership experience” are prized above passion.
Tragically, this “leadership experience” is mostly tainted. The pressure to engage in a large number of clubs rather than dedicate quality time to just a couple can cause ineffective leadership. Many clubs have hierarchical structures with a single person at the top. Demanding leadership roles can make participation logistically challenging for first-generation, low-income students who must balance work with extracurriculars.
For students who do lead clubs, the responsibilities take up significant time and emotional bandwidth. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, enterprising individuals may use their unchecked power to make fantastically horrible decisions that ultimately harm their own future and the future of their organizations.
If you are keeping a tally of the ingredients that make up student life at Harvard, you may have noticed by now that “fun” is missing from the list. Believe it or not, these conditions are not conducive to fulfillment or enjoyment — but you should not write this off as an individualistic problem.
We need to radically restructure the clubs that exist. It’s not enough to make symbolic gestures; a co-coordinator doing the job of a president might as well retain the title. I would argue that few clubs, if any at all, need a hierarchy. A board of individuals can divide responsibilities and lead as effectively as a single person. Restructuring clubs in this way would allow students to engage specifically with an aspect of an organization, reduce the barrier to entry, and decrease the pressure to control a club or hold the position of president. The checks and balances of group decision-making also decrease the chances that anyone could single-handedly control an amount of money equivalent to the annual income of a family.
Most importantly, these changes could drive a cultural shift towards focusing on activities that spark passion and joy rather than strengthen sections of a resume — and hopefully bring back fun to a campus that desperately needs it.

The Harvard College Women’s Center organized a series of events, titled “Embodied,” last week to celebrate its 17th annual Women’s Week.
The events, planned by the Women’s Center and various Harvard student organizations, focused on the role of women within society and included film screenings, career chats, discussion panels, and even dance classes to highlight women’s history and presence in the world.
Women’s Week has occurred annually since the establishment of Harvard College Women’s Center in 2007. The programming seeks to include a diverse set of panels focusing on personhood, women’s presence in STEM, the Latina experience, and South Asian motherhood in addition to many other topics.
According to Alejandra Rincon, assistant director of the Women’s Center, the aim of the program is to increase awareness of the importance of gender equity, celebrate the accomplishments of women and gender-expansive people and create spaces for Harvard affiliates to share their “varied and intersectional experiences.”
Karen Choi ’25, who co-organized Women’s Week with Jenna N. Cohn ’22-’23, said the Women’s Center works to amplify a diverse array of voices on campus in all of its efforts. Choi said this year’s theme for Women’s Week was inspired by recent movements for bodily autonomy, hence the name “Embodied.”
“I think it’s all about curating a safe space for people on campus,” she said.
Among the events planned were “Mental Health Spotlight: The Intersection of Gender and Wellness,” “Tropes of Bodily Femininity in Asian Women,” and “Dismantling Rape Culture.”
Alice Wu ’25, who moderated a panel on women in statistics and data science hosted by the Group for Undergraduates in Statistics at Harvard College, said the goal of the event was to “provide an open forum to let women in these generally male-dominated fields share their experience with students.”
“I’m in Stat 171 right now, and I think that class is probably something along the lines of like 80 percent men,” she said.
Rincon wrote to The Crimson that the week’s events gave students the opportunity to have important conversations surrounding women’s issues.
“Dialogue is so important for our goal to challenge, motivate, and inspire students and communities to pursue gender equity in all its intersectional manifestations,” she wrote.
“We also would love to remind students that gender equity is for all and we welcome people of all genders to join us for our programming,” Rincon added.

The Boston Planning and Development Agency board officially approved plans for a development on Harvard-owned land at 176 Lincoln St. on Feb. 16 — a key step in the city’s review process prior to breaking ground.
Berkeley Investments — the developer who won the bid to lease the land at 176 Lincoln St. from Harvard — plans to “reimagine” the 5.2-acre site along the I-90 Massachusetts Turnpike into an “innovation village,” per its website. Berkeley Investments aims to create affordable art and work units, residential apartments, 2,000 new permanent jobs, research labs, and offices, its website adds.
Allston-Brighton residents are expected to have access to publicly open spaces, estimated to encompass 38 percent of the project site, according to the project website.
“With our 176 Lincoln project, we are investing in and contributing to Allston-Brighton’s momentum toward becoming one of the top economic, cultural, and residential centers in Boston and the entire Northeast,” Berkeley Investments wrote in a Feb. 16 press release announcing the project’s approval.
Members of the project’s impact advisory group and others involved in the development convened at a public meeting last month to comment on the project prior to the BPDA’s approval.
Chandler Rosenberger, a member of the project’s impact advisory group, lauded the developers’ “responsiveness” to the “neighborhood concerns.”
Rosenberger added that after residents expressed concerns over parking and potential traffic noise, Berkeley revised its proposal and returned it to the impact advisory group with further updates.
“It addressed all of our concerns,” Rosenberger said of the revised project plans.
In a letter to BPDA Senior Project Manager Sarah Black on the day of the project’s approval, Boston city councilor Elizabeth A. Breadon, said she supports the 176 Lincoln St. project, citing proposed affordability, open space, compliance with zoning regulations, and the construction of two new streets adjacent to the project site.
Breadon also praised the lease agreement between Berkeley Investments and non-profit workshop Artisan’s Asylum. Berkeley Investments “committed approximately 8,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space” to the non-profit, Braedon wrote.
“Provided that all agreed-upon mitigation measures and benefits are documented in the project’s Cooperation Agreement, I support this project,” Breadon wrote.
Some residents of the Allston area expressed concerns regarding the proposed development.
Allston resident Cindy Marchando said while she supports the project, she believes many of the benefits Berkeley Investments has offered are merely mitigation efforts.
“If you dissect a lot of what they consider community benefits, you would actually see it’s more of a mitigation,” she said.
Marchando also raised concerns around Harvard’s relationship with the project, alleging the University is “hiding behind the developer” to advance its interests without having to associate itself with the development.
“Harvard had the same behavior of hands off — we’re just leasing the land and the developer is responsible for everything else,” she said. “That for us is Harvard hiding behind the developer and not paying their shared dues on this project.”
Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa did not comment on Marchando’s allegations.
Morgan Pierson, a senior vice president at Berkeley Investments, said in an interview that Harvard only leased the land at 176 Lincoln St. and is not involved in the project’s planning.
“Harvard is the landlord in the sense that they own the ground,” he added. “The design is 100 percent from Berkeley Investments and we’re very proud of that effort.”
Pierson also said Berkeley Investments aims to address as many residents’ concerns and requests as possible.
“What our goals are for these is to try and meet as many of the requests and desires of the community members that we can while also delivering a feasible project,” Pierson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than three dozen animal rights activists demanded University President Lawrence S. Bacow shut down a lab at Harvard Medical School that conducted nonhuman primate experiments during a Tuesday afternoon protest outside Harvard Yard.
The protesters, many of whom were affiliated with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals group, took aim at experiments conducted on monkeys by HMS professor Margaret S. Livingstone. In pamphlets distributed at the protest, PETA affiliates and supporters alleged Livingstone tortured baby macaques by stealing them from their mothers and sewing their eyes shut.
Amanda B. Brody, a senior campaigner for PETA who attended the protest on Tuesday, said Livingstone’s experiments on monkeys are “putting a stain on the University.”
“Harvard should honestly be embarrassed that this is happening at their university,” Brody said. “It needs to be shut down immediately.”
The protest, which took place outside Johnston Gate, is the latest development in a monthslong campaign against Livingstone’s research.
In October 2022, PETA began circulating a petition requesting that Bacow and HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82 shut down Livingstone’s lab, the same demand echoed by protesters on Tuesday. The petition has now amassed more than 88,500 signatures.
Livingstone and HMS issued separate statements in October disputing PETA’s description of Livingstone’s research.
“The content presented on the PETA website is misleading and contains factual inaccuracies,” HMS wrote in a Oct. 14 statement. “The video, certain photos, and some of the behaviors described on the website are not from Dr. Margaret Livingstone’s lab, and descriptions related to her methods contain inaccuracies and exaggerations.”
Livingstone wrote in a Oct. 24 statement published on the HMS website that the tactics used by animal rights activists to criticize her research “have miscast my work, twisted facts, and spread inaccurate and false information wrapped in emotionally charged, inflammatory language.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on Tuesday regarding demands for Bacow to shut down Livingstone’s lab. Livingstone did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday and a spokesperson for HMS pointed to October 2022 statements by the Medical School and Livingstone.
More than 380 researchers, including famed primatologist Jane Goodall, signed a letter last month calling on the National Institutes of Health to stop funding nonhuman primate experimentation.
HMS defended the use of animals for research purposes in its October 2022 statement.
“The humane and regulated use of animal models in biomedical research remains indispensable for understanding the biological processes that give rise to disease, for designing new therapies and interventions to improve health, and for ensuring such treatments are safe and effective,” the Medical School wrote. “The treatment and eventual eradication of many diseases will be enabled by knowledge generated from research in animal models.”
John K. Tyson, an animal rights activist, said he attended the protest because of the similarities between humans and macaque monkeys.
“Ninety-eight percent of our DNA is the same. They’re us, they’re our family,” Tyson said. “We’ve just been trained that — like some of the other ways we’ve been trained to think — that some lives matter more than others.”
“Gandhi said he thought the life of a lamb was as sacred as the life of a human,” Tyson added. “I think he was right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Grid Accelerator awarded funding last month to five Harvard-led research projects aiming to bring innovative technologies to the market.
The five recipients are an artificial intelligence-assisted design project, a fast drug-resistance test, an emission-free refrigerant, a wearable to aid stroke rehab, and a gene discovery startup. The Harvard Grid was established in September 2022 as a joint project between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Harvard Office of Technology Development.
Paul N. Hayre, the accelerator’s executive director, said the Grid’s mission is to facilitate the commercialization of scientific and academic research in order “to reduce the activation energy to lift more ideas from lab to market.”
Hayre said he believes the Grid is different from other initiatives because it specializes in providing opportunities for “translating tough tech.”
“We’re not so much designed to help facilitate the Mark Zuckerbergs in their dorm room who want to launch a software app,” he said. “There’s a lot of resources, and I think students have been finding their merry way to do that quite effectively. That’s not to say we wouldn't support someone who came knocking on the door of the Grid to support that.”
Assistant professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Jarad Mason — who leads the research project developing a new class of solid refrigerants to enable emission-free cooling — said the Grid Accelerator is an important source of funding for industry-oriented research.
“In the physical sciences and hard sciences, tough technology space, I would say, there historically have been much more limited opportunities for that kind of funding and the Harvard Grid Accelerator fills in that gap,” Mason said.
Juanjuan Zheng, a SEAS postdoctoral fellow leading research to create a system for fast drug-resistance testing, wrote in a statement that the Grid’s funding and expertise will be “instrumental” for the project’s next steps.
“In partnership with colleagues from Harvard’s teaching hospitals, we aim to utilize the support from the Grid to showcase our method across a wide range of real-world bacterial samples and anti-bacterial drugs,” Zheng wrote.
Yunha Hwang, an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Ph.D. candidate spearheading the project that analyzes genomes through language models, said the Grid provided an opportunity to combine research and industry techniques.
“Grid was a great opportunity for us to learn about how to build a business model using technology that is still developing,” she said.
The Grid Accelerator is a rebranded and extended version of the Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator, which was founded in 2013. Alan Gordon, the director of business development at OTD, has headed the accelerator since its founding.
“Previously, with the Physical Sciences Accelerator, we were typically funding about three projects a year,” Gordon said.
Gordon added that the Grid is intended to bolster research from across multiple schools and divisions within Harvard.
“It was important to us that the Grid is also a resource for entrepreneurial-minded faculty and students in the sciences throughout the University,” he said. “So in the accelerator, a couple of the projects that were funded are with faculty in FAS in the division of Science, not specifically in the School of Engineering.”
Hayre said in addition to providing annual awards, the Grid has a small fund to allocate to promising research projects outside of the regular grant timeline.
“Research doesn’t work on an annual schedule where once a year, you wake up and all of a sudden you’re ready to submit,” Hayre said.
“My goal certainly is to find partners and donors that would say, ‘This is important to SEAS, it’s important to Harvard, it’s something that is showing impact, and we’d like to support it,’” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charles M. Lieber, the Harvard chemistry professor convicted of lying to federal investigators in 2021, quietly retired last month, a Harvard spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.
Lieber, who formerly chaired Harvard’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, was found guilty on six felony counts, including two counts of lying to the government about his ties to the Chinese government and four tax offenses.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that Lieber retired from Harvard on Feb. 1.
Lieber, who is 63, has been on paid administrative leave since being charged in 2020. In 2017, he was appointed as a University professor, the highest faculty rank at Harvard.
Newton declined to comment on whether Lieber would receive emeritus status or whether Harvard administrators had asked him to retire.
Harvard does not automatically grant emeritus status to retired professors “based on the fact of retirement alone,” according to the 2022-2023 Faculty of Arts and Sciences handbook. Professors are eligible for emeritus status when a faculty member retires, is over 60, and has at least five years of service prior to retirement. A professor may also retain emeritus status for their endowed chair position if they previously held one.
Lieber’s name no longer appears on the CCB department’s website nor on Harvard’s list of University professors. His name was on the list as recently as Feb. 4, according to Internet archives. As of Tuesday evening, webpages for Lieber’s research group and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor profile were still live.
Lieber did not respond to a request for comment. Stephanie Guaba, one of Lieber’s attorneys, declined to comment when reached by phone.
Theodore A. Betley, the chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, wrote in an email that “to the best of my knowledge, Prof. Lieber’s status as a University Professor means all handling of his retirement was dealt with by the President’s office.”
The professor, once a preeminent voice in the field of nanotechnology, was arrested in 2020 on Harvard’s campus and charged with lying to federal authorities about his involvement with China’s Thousand Talents Program — a state-run program to recruit academic researchers in the country — and his affiliation with the Wuhan University of Technology.
Lieber’s lawyers previously argued for a speedy trial because of his stage-four lymphoma diagnosis and deteriorating health. In December 2021, he was convicted after a six-day trial.
Lieber’s sentencing was initially scheduled for January 2023, but it was rescheduled for later this month. He faces up to 26 years in prison and up to $1.2 million in fines.
The conviction served as an important victory for the Department of Justice’s now-defunct China Initiative to combat Chinese espionage, which was criticized by some as politically-motivated and subject to racial profiling.
Correction: March 23, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Charles M. Lieber was convicted of lying to the FBI. In fact, Lieber was convicted of lying to federal investigators for the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month’s Harvard Undergraduate Association officer election was marked by lower turnout and more uncontested races than elections in previous years, drawing reflection from students about the newly formed body.
Some students speculated that a lack of motivation or belief in the body’s impact on the student body may have led to low turnout and a lack of candidates. John S. Cooke ’25 and Shikoh Misu Hirabayashi ’24 were elected as the second HUA co-presidents on Feb. 21, alongside nine other officers.
Roughly 1,950 undergraduates cast ballots in the election, which represented approximately 26 percent of the student body. While this marked a small improvement from last year’s 1,849 ballots, previous elections under the recently dissolved Undergraduate Council saw 2,000 to 4,000 ballots cast every year except 2020, which had 1,518 voters.
“I feel like it’s a civic duty to vote in any opportunity that you can,” said Thomas A. Tait ’26, who voted in the election. “Even if it’s student government, where I think the candidate that gets elected doesn’t have too much of an impact on the actual policy, I felt that it was more of a moral obligation.”
Hugo R. Núñez Jr. ’26, who also voted in the races, attributed the turnout numbers to a lack of student motivation.
“Students don’t really see incentive to vote,” Núñez said. “You have to take time out of your day to research the candidates and look through your email.”
Núñez suggested incentivizing voter turnout by raffling off free food.
“The HUA has an impact on our lives, but not many students think about or look too deeply into it,” he said.
In a written statement, outgoing HUA Co-Presidents Travis Allen Johnson ’24 and LyLena D. Estabine ’24 highlighted the slight increase in ballots cast this year compared to last.
“We were pleased to see an increase in voter turnout, and we hope that more and more students will continue to vote in these elections,” the co-presidents wrote.
Of this year’s nine officer races, just two — for the co-presidency and academic officer — were contested. In the 2022 HUA election, multiple candidates competed in all races except for one.
Nuriel R. Vera-DeGraff ’26 said he believes the student body’s perception of the HUA led to a lack of competition in the election.
“I think the problem is that the institution overall doesn’t really have much credibility, and that’s why people aren’t gonna want to be a candidate to run if you don’t even care about the organization,” Vera-DeGraff said.
Johnson and Estabine wrote that the election is about “candidate quality over quantity.”
“All of the candidates who ran presented comprehensive policies and campaign ideas and we look forward to watching them execute and enact them,” they wrote.
Ahmad H. Kanafani ’26 said he believes students may not run for officer positions because they do not think the roles carry power.
“I think the problem is that people think that if they take up the role, they will be unimportant, and they will not have a say in anything,” Kanafani said.
Kanafani said he believes if the power of these roles were expanded, there would be more students campaigning for them.
Tait expressed hope for more candidates in future elections, adding that he believes that students will see this year’s lack of contested officer positions as a reason to “take a shot at running.”
The election also featured ranked-choice voting, a system that allows voters to express candidate preferences beyond their top pick by ranking all contenders.
Vera-DeGraff said while he is a proponent of the system, it is not without its drawbacks.
“People might rank randomly or give it up to chance, which seems unfair to the actual democratic process,” Vera-DeGraff said. “Definitely I’m in favor of ranked-choice voting. I do think, though, information has to come along with it to make sure it’s more effective.”
HUA co-presidential ticket Laila A. Nasher ’25 and Ethan C. Kelly ’25 received the highest number of first-choice votes in this year’s elections, but they did not ultimately win because of the ranked-choice system.
“One of the best features of ranked-choice voting is its ability to elect candidates who can garner broad support from a variety of students,” Johnson and Estabine wrote. “Ranked-choice voting helps reduce the chances of extremely polarized candidates winning office.”
“As such, we support this system,” they added.

Harvard junior Jamal Nimer ’23-’24 said he returned from leave this semester to find dining hall food that he described as “significantly, significantly better.”
“I think they’re doing well with these special meals, like the tacos today and also the Nashville chicken sandwiches — those are really good,” Nimer said on Tuesday. “Overall, the offerings are a lot better.”
On Feb. 15, Harvard University Dining Services debuted a revamped menu and a slew of other changes to undergraduate meal offerings, including a more diverse variety of food options, themed brunches, and customizable, deconstructed dinners.
Peter A. Jin ’25 said he has gradually noticed changes, especially in the range of food options.
“I’ve been generally a fan of HUDS, but I’ve definitely noticed a difference starting mid-February,” Jin said Tuesday. “I feel like I’ve been noticing more selection in the hotbar.”
Isaac A. Newman ’25 said he first saw positive changes to HUDS months before official changes were implemented.
“For me, the HUDS revamp began in the spring of last year, with these beautiful bowls here,” said Newman, gesturing to two stacked white salad bowls.
This year’s update is not the first time HUDS has made efforts to tweak its offerings in recent years. In fall 2021, Harvard’s dining service added brunch service on Saturdays in all houses and adjusted dining hours.
Newman added he would like to see some extra salad toppings.
“My main thing I would like to request are toasted pine nuts, and sesame oil at all the dining halls because it’s everyone’s favorite oil — and goat cheese. I’m already so happy with the revamp, but that would just put some icing on top,” he said.
Jordan A. Sanchez ’23-’24 said she has noticed “a positive shift” in the food quality and lauded the Black History Month-inspired dishes served in February.
“I’ve enjoyed it,” Sanchez said of the new menu. “Then again, I feel like I’m very easy to please when it comes to food.”
Despite the new dishes, not all students said they noticed an improvement in food quality.
“I think with their newly adopted menu, there’s a sense of novelty,” Pranav S. Ganta ’25 said Tuesday. “I think that once you see the repetitiveness of the menu over time, that novelty wears away and the food itself hasn’t improved at all. It’s just the same grilled chicken with different sauces, like, 18 different times.”
Inseo Yeo ’26 — who is living on campus for the first time this semester — said though he does not find the quality to be much different, he thought the food was “more fresh.”
“Quality hasn’t changed drastically, but quantity-wise, I think they’re trying to add more options, which I do appreciate,” Yeo said.
Lap T. Nguyen ’24 also said he values the effort to bring new cultural influences to the dishes.
“I really want to highlight their creativity to incorporate foods from different cuisines and different cultures,” Nguyen said. “Sometimes they don’t fully hit the mark, but I really do appreciate their effort and it’s really good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few people know Mufi Hannemann ‘76 for his exploits as a basketball player. As an alum of the Harvard men’s basketball team, Hannemann has become a distinguished leader in both business and politics, working in three presidential administrations (Carter, Clinton, and Bush), serving as the Mayor of Honolulu for six years, and most recently leading the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Association, Hawaii’s largest private tourism organization, as President and CEO, his second stint holding that post.
Hannemann has had a unique path to success. His father Gustav and mother Faiaso immigrated to Hawaii from Samoa before his birth because of a desire for their children to be educated in a “western environment.” He remembers that early on, his mother (and eventually father) adopted a version of the American dream that one of their children would go on to attend Harvard. Hannemann believes that vision was sparked by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt’s visit to American Samoa in 1943.
“I think that might have gotten my mom thinking because she made such a great impact,” Hannemann said. “My mom was telling me, ‘that's where presidents go to school.’” Hannemann didn’t find out about Roosevelt’s trip until after Faiaso’s passing, so he never got to ask her about the visit.
While attending Kalihi Kai Elementary, a public school in Honolulu, Hannemann remembers his mother telling him about her dream. He responded with skepticism, explaining that people from Kalihi “don't get into Harvard.”After seventh grade, Hannemann earned a scholarship to attend ‘Iolani School, where he played basketball and football while excelling academically. Hard work enabled him to overcome a historic lack of precedent and fulfill his mother’s dream by getting accepted into Harvard during his senior year. Hannemann also was accepted to Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Brown, and Cornell, making history as the first Samoan to receive offers of admission from several of those institutions.
The importance of helping others that Faiaso instilled in him, as well as his habit of reading the biographies of many politicians, convinced Hannemann early on that he was interested in government. Before leaving for Harvard, he remembers his mother telling him: “you go get educated and then you come back and help.” That mission is one that Hannemann took to heart.
At Harvard, Hannemann continued to play basketball as a member of the varsity squad and also pursued his interest in politics, winning the election to the post of president of the freshman council (the student government entity preceding the Undergraduate Council) in his first year. It was at Harvard that he developed a goal of one day working in the White House. He remembers Government 154, a class taught by the legendary presidential biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, as being particularly influential. Kearns spoke of her experience as a White House fellow working alongside president Lyndon Johnson, something that struck Hannemann as being exceptionally impressive. His tutor, Roger Porter, also served as a White House fellow in the Ford administration, compounding Hannemann’s interest in one day serving in such a role.
“With those two and hearing of their experience of one working for President Ford, the other working for President Johnson, I said, ‘Man, I gotta be a White House fellow,’” Mufi recalled.
Remembering his mother’s advice, upon graduating in 1976, Hannemann wanted to give back to ‘Iolani School for the opportunities it had given him, returning to his alma mater as a history teacher and JV basketball coach. After a year of teaching and coaching, he took a break to complete a Fulbright Scholarship in New Zealand, a center of Polynesian culture, with the hopes of learning more about his Samoan roots. After a year abroad, Hannemann returned to ‘Iolani, this time as a coach for the varsity basketball squad. Hannemann also maintained his aspirations to work in the White House, and in 1979 he began his first government service role after being selected as special assistant to Hawaii Governor George Ariyoshi. That role kickstarted a “string of gubernatorial and presidential appointments” during which he fulfilled his goal of working in the White House. These appointments led to the 2004 election for Mayor of Honolulu, in which Hannemann was elected after a hard-fought campaign cycle.
Throughout his life, two things that have remained constant for Hannemann are basketball and his passion for helping others, something he has been able to achieve through politics. It’s no coincidence that politics and sports are complementary of each other. When asked about the parallels between what is required of an athlete and a politician, Hannemann emphasized the foundation that an athletic career can provide.
“I always say that if people have an athletic background it's a proper training ground, to be a good leader,” Hannemann said. “Whether it’s the government, the private sector, the nonprofit world, or academia.”
Sport provides an opportunity to learn fundamentals that are easily adaptable to other areas of life. Hannemann referenced the development of a sense of “grace under pressure” as one such fundamental. The unique pressures that intense sporting situations, such as last-minute free throws or a key touchdown reception, provide, create the circumstances needed to develop such skills. Hannemann also pointed out that like in sports, in the worlds of politics and business, not everyone can be a star.
“No matter how talented you are, whether it's Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant, you need someone who can rebound, you need someone who can set pace, you need someone who can play defense,” He said. Without an understanding of what it means to be part of a team, it is impossible to be effective as an athlete or a leader.
Hannemann has definitely had to hit clutch free throws and do some rebounding, at least metaphorically, during his political career. As Mayor of Honolulu during the 2008 financial crisis, he was faced with the daunting task of steering Hawaii’s economic engine through the great recession. In an interview with Hawaii News Now during the recent 2020 Mayoral election, in which Hannemann put together an unsuccessful bid for a third term as Mayor, he discussed the tough decisions he had to make during that period. Among other things, Hannemann talked about his response to the state-wide “Furlough Friday'' program, a highly controversial initiative that cut worker hours in an attempt to reduce the government’s operating budget.
“I had to make sure that the unions were in a good place in negotiating their furloughs and their pay cuts, something that the state had done through a top-down decision-making with ‘Furlough Fridays’, and I was able to do that without raising property taxes,” Hannemann said.
Making difficult choices and adapting to the decisions of others is a theme on and off the basketball court. In a 2006 Star Bulletin feature, Hannemann’s older brother Nephi Hannemann used Mufi’s athletic prowess as an analogy explaining his approach to political leadership.
"He's fearless in making tough decisions,” Nephi said. “Like in sports, there are a select few who want the ball at crunch time. 'Give me the ball, give me the ball.' He wants the ball," said Nephi.
Hannemann’s recent connection to the sport has come through the Mufi Hannemann Basketball Jamboree, an annual event now in its 29th year. The tournament invites the best high school women’s basketball players from across the state to compete in a showcase event on Oahu each February. Each year, Hannemann takes the best players from the tournament to the mainland, providing them with the opportunity to showcase their skills at a national level. The initiative is part of an effort to address a prevailing disadvantage that athletes from Hawaii face: a lack of exposure to opportunities for playing at the next level.
“Local girls playing here don't have the exposure [that you have] when you live in the continental US and can go to all the camps and get noticed by the scouts,”  Hannemann said. “We actually have to travel there.”
Hannemann also spoke of the value of disproving gender stereotypes, especially those prevalent in Hawaii about women’s participation in many sports and the ability to take that participation to a professional level.
“I think if you go through life, and your goals are just to achieve fame and fortune, it's a very shallow life,” Hannemann said near the end of our conversation. By taking the path less traveled and searching for ways to share the profits of the opportunities you are given, you serve as a role model for future generations to do the same. “That's what life is all about,” Hannemann said. Mufi Hannemann has certainly embodied those principles, always striving for success and that of others, on and off the court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard track and field is set to take the stage at the 2023 NCAA Division I Indoor Championships for Track and Field this weekend following a season of record-breaking victory. Most recently, senior John Minicus was the only athlete who competed for Harvard at the IC4A/ECAC championships at Boston University this past Saturday, March 4. Minicus represented the Crimson well, as he stood in second place for the men’s pentathlon with a score of 5128 points —  a score high enough for Minicus to mark a new Harvard record in the event.
Minicus had stand-out performances, including winning two events in the pentathlon. He won the long jump with a mark of 6.74 m and won the 60 m hurdles with a time of 8.36 seconds.
The ICAC/ECAC championship meet followed the Ivy League Championships the previous week, where the women’s team defended its second Ivy League Heptagonal Championship title. At the conclusion of the league championships, head coach Jason Saretsky was named the Ivy League Women’s Indoor Track and Field Coach of the Year.
Going into the Ivy League Heptagonal Championship meet, the Crimson coach had goals for the track and field team.
“We try to focus on what we can control,” said Saretsky in reference to the team’s mindset heading into Heptagonal Championships. “And if we do what we’ve been doing all season to get us to that point, we’re gonna have a good meet.”
The team had more than just a good meet, with the women’s team taking home the gold with more than 25 points over runner-up, Princeton.
“I was certainly proud of all our team members — not just those that made the trip to Dartmouth, but our entire squad,” said the head coach about the team’s performance at the Heptagonal Championships. “We’ve got over 110 student-athletes, and it really is a testament to all of them. Their hard work and how committed they are to the program allowed us to have this success.”
For the track and field team, making sure that athletes are well prepared on the track as well as in academics is a key goal.
“We’re always striving for academic and athletic excellence here with Harvard and Track and Field, and we want to be the best versions of ourselves,” Sarestky said.
The Crimson achieved those goals with 27 athletes earning All-Ivy honors at the conclusion of the Heptagonal Championships. In addition, Seniors Stephanie Ratcliffe and Alexander Kolesnikoff were named to the Academic All-Ivy team.
“We’re really proud and pleased with how well the indoor season went, and particularly for the women defending the Ivy League Championship,” Saretsky reflected. “Getting and keeping the trophy here, as well as getting the most points scored by any Ivy League women’s team indoors, so it’s an incredible accomplishment for them.”
The team had a number of standout performances over the course of the championships, with 16 individual and relay first-place finishes.
“In terms of individuals, it’s easy to point to those who were recognized by the Ivy League coaches for their most outstanding performances — Stephanie Ratcliffe, Kenny Ikeji for the field event performers, and Maia Ramsden for the track performer,” said Coach Saretsky about the team’s most exciting performances during championships. “I personally thought Graham Blanks in his triple was fairly heroic, winning the 3K and 5K, and then 20 minutes later anchoring the DMR with the second fastest mile in the field to help the team get fifth place was remarkable.”
In regards to the large number of records broken by the team this season, Coach Saretsky also had some food for thought, saying “It was a lot of fun and really exciting, a testament to their hard work and dedication. It’s one of those things that you don’t want to take for granted, records are hard to break.”
Looking forward, Harvard track and field competes next in the 2023 NCAA Indoor Championships and will send six athletes to Albuquerque, N.M. to represent the Crimson. To qualify for the event, the athletes had to have received a mark that ranked within the top 16 in the nation.
“This is the largest contingent since I’ve been here, that we’ll be sending to the indoor national championships,” said Sarestky about the athletes who have qualified for the highly anticipated NCAA tournament.
Sophomore Izzy Goudros, ranked 13th in the nation, will represent Harvard in the women’s pentathlon, her score for the event at 4173 points. Her teammate junior Maia Ramsden will also compete for the women’s team, doubling in the women’s mile and 3000 m run. Her time of 4:30.19 seconds in the mile places her at an impressive second place standing in the nation, while her 3000 m time of 8:54.39 seconds places her in eighth place.
Sophomore Graham Blanks and teammate junior Acer Iverson will both run in the men’s 5000m, being ranked 7th and 13th in the nation respectively.
On the throwing side, two athletes from the men’s team will compete for the Crimson, including sophomore Kenneth Ikeji in the men’s weight throw, and senior Alexander Kolesnikoff in the men’s shot put.
“I’ve always found that the indoor nationals is maybe the hardest one to get to, since it’s the top 16 declared in each event for any performance throughout the season,” Saretsky commented. “I’m excited for the six athletes that we have competing in New Mexico and seeing how they stack up against the nation’s best.”

There’s no better word to describe Winthrop House than community — something special is always brewing.
“We are reinventing and reimagining and adding our own spin to Winthrop,” said HoCo Co-Chair Bessem Enow ’24. Let’s call in the receipts to prove it: Community dinner nights with raffles to win Winthrop Swag and meet fellow Winthropians. Endless Steins to highlight and bring together different communities, from Karaoke Stein to ValenStein to Hispanic Heritage Month Stein. The annual Arbella Spring Formal (did we mention it was on a yacht?!). You name it, Winthrop’s got it!
This strong sense of community is carried throughout the faculty and staff at Winthrop House. “Goretti is our dhall swiper. Everyone knows her and she knows all of us by name. All of our dhall staff is amazing,” said HoCo Co-Chair Melanie M. Armella ’24. The dhall is central to Winthrop – every night the place comes alive, filled with chatter, laughter, and vibes, all to a top-tier dhall playlist curated by yours truly, Winthrop’s amazing dhall staff.
And, we cannot forget about Winthrop’s cutest pets, who may just be on par with Remy. There's the iconic Annie the dog and the lovely Porkchop the cat. Make sure to befriend them as you’ll want them as your ally when you’re racing around campus on Bluebikes to win the Winthrop scavenger hunt (which comes with tons of bragging rights).
The truth is simple. No one moves out of Winthrop. People try to move in. As Armella put it, “You’re not gonna cry on Housing Day when we pull up.”
If you aren’t sold yet, just wait until you hear about the housing. Winthrop has three impressive halls: Standish, Gore, and Beren, and this past year Fairfax was introduced for overflow housing (apartment style located right above J.P. Licks!). Arguably, Winthrop House has the best sophomore dorms: “We have a disproportionate amount of singles, so a lot of people do get singles,” says Enow. Another common sophomore dorm is a massive double (also a W).
If Winthrop falls short in one place, it’s… JK no places! Winthrop does not fall short anywhere, especially not when it comes to prime lounging and common areas. There’s the historical JFK Suite where many special IOP guests stay, as well as the eight-man party suite. The Beren Rooftop Room is another wonderful hosting space with a stunning view of the river. And, of course, we cannot forget the Lion’s Den, featuring pool tables, foosball, TVs, couches — perfect for late Friday nights or Sunday watch parties.
Winthrop House is also home to the best napping places. “I love a nap on the hammock,” says Armella, to which Bessem also adds, “I have fallen asleep on them.” Other prime napping locations include anywhere in the gorgeous courtyard (there’s an iconic tire swing there too!), beanbags in the Standish basement, and honestly anywhere in the Winthrop library (just place a textbook under your head and let the knowledge seep into you).
Still reading because you can’t get enough info about Winthrop? Listen to what the HoCo chairs had to say:
If you had to describe your house in 3 words what would they be?
BE: Classy.
MMA: Community and light.
What’s the biggest misconception about your house?
BE: That we’re snooty and stuck-up, but we’re bougie.
MMA: Everyone who is a part of this house, genuinely, is so down to earth. People just come and want to make you feel understood, and people are just super well meaning here. I think you can especially see it in our dhall and in our time spent here and the interactions with staff. This is truly such an inclusive community.
If you had to change one thing about your house what would it be?
MMA: I would make it bigger. I would have more people be a part of Winthrop. Open it up to more people and share the wealth.
If you had to liken your house to a fruit, what fruit would it be and why?
MMA: An orange because oranges are meant to be shared with people you love, the way I would peel an orange and give off little pieces to my friends. I think Winthrop is all about that: sharing fun experiences with your friends.
What side of TikTok would your house be on?
MMA: Our house would definitely have a bit of an athletic side of TikTok but also keeping up with the trends. We know what’s going on but we’d have our own twist on it. We’re not the super mainstream TikTok — we’ve got a little edge to us.
If you could describe your House with a HUDS dish, what would it be?
MMA: Sunday Sundaes.
Fave sidechat post about your house? 
MMA: I saw a post about our Arbella formal and how fun it was which I think is true!
Could Winthrop be where you call home for the next three years?

As an Eliot resident, you’ll get to enjoy a variety of special traditions that make Eliot the house to be in. More than any other tradition, Eliot is best known for their annual formal, Fête. HoCo Co-Chair Delaney C. Jones ’24 describes the formal with “ice sculptures and champagne fountains and around 2000 chocolate covered strawberries that students spend hours dipping themselves the day before.” Chocolate covered strawberries? Count me in. Jones continues, “It’s a big community event. We’ll also try and welcome in other students from other communities as our plus ones.” Fête is generally held on the pavilion in Eliot courtyard and is one of the most attended formals among the houses.
If you can’t wait for Fête to get classy, Eliot’s enhanced dinners, which happen at least once a month, offer an alternative to that. HoCo Co-Chair Ava L. Baldassari ’24 explained that the dinners include “really good food and fancy desserts. We put out tablecloths and flowers.” Enhanced dinners are accentuated even further during the holidays, when they invite special performers and use fancy Eliot chinaware to really drive that magical experience.
If you’re looking for something less fancy, you can always pull up to Eliot dhall on any old day. Baldassari says, “It’s always a nice place to go if you’re looking to do work with other people.” Eliot dhall has the steady hum of voices at all hours of the day. A great collaborative and social area, it is one of the spaces that ties the house together.
Jones’s favorite space is the Eliot records room, where “there’s an entire wall of old records, and there’s speakers, and there’s clothes and couches, and there’s a record player.” For musicians and music-listeners alike, the records room is truly something special. Baldassari, on the other hand, is partial to the Golden Arm, a movie theater inside Eliot. According to her, you can “come together with friends, watch a movie or watch a TV show or just sit together and not feel enclosed.”
With many amenities, common spaces, and special events, Eliot boasts a close-knit community for all its residents. It’s the perfect combination of options for the most introverted and the most extroverted of us.
Eliot residents all live in suite-style housing. With various different arrangements, the perfect suite exists for groups of all sizes. Additionally, all Eliot suites have in-suite bathrooms. Though not usually for sophomores, there are two famed party suites: Ground Zero and the Cock Pit.
Eliot’s many amenities include a Grille (“The Inferno”), a private movie theater (“The Golden Arm”), a recording studio (“The Tower Room”), a gym, a dance studio, a records room for all vinyl lovers, a woodshop, an art studio, and a beautiful house library overlooking the scenic Charles River.
Need more info? The HoCo chairs dive deeper.
Is there anything that you would want to change about Eliot?
DCJ: The one thing that I want to change about Eliot is the perception from other houses and maybe first years. I think we’re known as an old house because we haven’t been renovated yet. But I definitely don’t think that’s to our detriment.
ALB: I don’t think any of our facilities are any less than anybody else’s because they’re not renovated.
Do you think the location is something that adds to Eliot?
ALB: Oh, definitely. First of all, you don't have to run to class, you can get to class if it’s in the yard, and like less than six minutes.
DCJ: Also, if you go to the SEC, it’s not that far, either.
ALB: It’s right over there.
DCJ: It’s such a central location.
Does Eliot have a saying or a phrase?
ALB: We definitely have a phrase… Domus de Eliot.
DCJ: Whenever you say Floreat Domus de Eliot you usually expect a response, which is ‘Domus’!
It doesn’t get much better than that. Domus!

“A group of really talented, incredibly driven, funny, quirky people” was the way that HoCo Co-Chair Aurora M. Avallone ’24 chose to describe the Kirkland community. The greatest part of this house is the people who make it, and with Kirk’s smaller size, you are bound to find your people. Never having to worry about finding someone you know to sit with in the dhall? Please, who wouldn’t want that.
The tutors of Kirkland also help foster community. Olivia J. Eckstein ‘24 described it best, saying, “[My tutor] was so active in my life, a lot of the tutors here are like that and I think that’s something really rare that I don’t really hear about from other houses.” No matter who you are, there is always someone for you to connect with in Kirkland.
Kirkland’s traditions are unlike any other. The house continues to implement new events into their agenda while keeping old traditions strong, offering much for the Kirkland community, as well as the greater Harvard community, to enjoy. You’ll never get bored if you’re in Kirkland, it’s quite impossible with all that there is going on, all thanks to Kirk’s lovely HoCo chairs.
One new tradition that Kirkland has started this year is their Build-a-Boar Bash. The name says it all. Who wouldn’t want to raise a tiny boar from a shell of fluff to a fully stuffed animal to represent their house pride? Avallone adds that just like these boars, Kirkland House is also “warm and cuddly and welcoming” as “we want people to be happy and have a good time.” Other new additions include Kirk’s mac and cheese bar as well as their Brew Club. That’s right, Kirkland is now the only house that makes their own alcohol from scratch. If that’s not a major flex, I don’t really know what is.
The older traditions of Kirkland are still standing strong, such as House Secret Santa which is a week-long gift-giving celebration. Kirkland residents are able to choose from varying levels of intensity for this event, from simply getting gifted a coffee run to being part of a live action Bachelor/karaoke event in the dhall, or even strip tease in the boar costume. Yes, a strip tease in the boar costume. Kirkland definitely makes sure to appeal to all in this event, and it is something that you will definitely not want to miss.
If you’re in Kirkland, you are bound to get to know your fellow Kirklanders very, very well — inside and outside of your dorm. Sophomores can be expected to be housed in a double with a common room and a bedroom, but a lucky few might also get overflow four-person suites in DeWolfe, which boast A/C systems and apartment-style kitchens. Juniors can also expect to share rooms, but alas, as a senior, you can finally have your long-awaited single. But in Kirkland, let’s be real, you’re going to want to continue to live with your fellow Kirklanders. That’s why you might also opt towards living in one of the two 10-man suites that Kirkland has to offer, which have the added plus of being perfect for hosting parties.
And, if you need alone time as well, Kirkland understands. Kirkland is here for you. Residents have exclusive access to the historic Hicks House, Kirkland’s house library. Hicks House, the second oldest house in all of Cambridge, will allow you to fulfill your dreams of dark academia romanticization. Eckstein reveals that Hicks “was used as a strategy house during the Revolutionary War. So there’s a bunch of really cool, old archived books and a bunch of stuff. There's some cool artifacts in there.” Kirkland also has its new additions of a meditation room and movie screening room, which became a part of the house post-pandemic.
Still curious? Kirkland’s HoCo chairs have you covered with more answers to your pressing questions.
If you could describe Kirkland as a day of the week, which day would you choose?
AMA: I’m thinking Thursday. I think Thursday can be one of the best days
OJE: Thursday is lowkey becoming the new Friday in a way.
AMA: Thursdays are so underrated. Like I feel Kirk gets very underrated on Harvard’s campus. I think we have made ourselves post-Covid into one of the very fun, desirable, active houses. You can do whatever you want with your Thursday. Thursday can be a steady grind day. Thursday can be a going-out day. Thursday can be a Stein day. Thursdays are a great day in Kirkland House.
What is one thing that you want freshmen to know about your House?
AMA: I would say, you won the jackpot, the community is just unparalleled. And we have other people from other houses who come to our Kirkland steins and they’re like, my house doesn’t have a mac and cheese bar or doesn’t do a Build-a-Boar event, how can I join this community? And we’re welcoming to anybody. If you’re not placed in Kirk, come by, come to Kirk.
OJE: I am so incredibly happy and joyful that I’ve gotten Kirk and I couldn't have asked honestly for any other house. Would implore the new freshman that we will be getting to look on the bright side. Look at what an amazing community that you’ve joined and that you’ll have now, and the support that you’ll have for many people who just wanna lift you up.
What would you say that Kirkland’s toxic trait is?
AMA: We’re very “We Are Kirkland” and it’s not in your face, but we are very proud to be Kirklanders and maybe you can call that toxic. I call that just being proud of where you come from and being really excited about life. But some people can be like, oh, that’s over positive. You’re not looking at all the stressful, negative things, but why do that when you’re in Kirkland house?
You don’t know what you’re missing out on. Come on in, Kirk’s waiting for you!

Your worst nightmare has come true. You thought that you had finally created the perfect spring 2023 schedule, but turns out your three-day weekend — or, let’s face it, the ability to have lunch every day — comes at a staggering price: midterms on Housing Day. Dun dun duuun! But never fear — it’s still possible to have TBHDE (the Best Housing Day Ever, obvi) and survive the latest bit of professor-assigned torture, all in one 24-hour period. To help you get through the last academic strife before spring break — just three more days, just three more days — Flyby’s prepped our favorite (not-so-serious) tips to multitask on gaining the favor of the River Gods and extracting your professor’s mercy.
Study during River Run.
You have to study at some point, so you might as well do it during River Run. Everyone’s always saying that you should study with distractions, and Housing Day eve is the perfect time to put that advice into practice. If you can recite random psych tidbits while half your mental faculties are otherwise occupied, you can definitely communicate the same concepts with some level of coherence on your midterm the next day. Plus, having your friends cheer you on as you reach another house at the same time as the end of another unit might be just the encouragement you need to keep the study train chugging on.
Camp out in Berg for merch drop… with your laptop!
When you get done flipping through flashcards as you race from Adams to Mather, you can continue your grind (to end all grinds) in Annenberg as you wait for house swag distribution to start at 11:30 a.m. You can reward yourself for being a true academic with the cutest house merch at the table!
Get your letter delivered to Science Center Hall B.
Every second counts when you’re cramming, so save yourself a few minutes by listing your exam location as the “dorm” of your blocking group’s letter recipient. By arriving to your midterm hours before it even starts, you’ll move into test-taking mode even before Dorm Storm ends, transforming yourself into a midterm mastermind and hopefully gaining some brownie points with your professor. Your blockmates might complain about it a little at first, but they’ll have to admit that your lecture hall has a much better view of the festivities than Pennypacker. Lecture halls are pretty similar to dorms anyway; you can snack, gossip, and sleep in them just as well as you can in Hollis North. (Clearly, we can attest to this based on many a day spent devoting 100 percent of our attention to lecture.)
Contract a mysterious illness.
Actually accepting your impending doom is overrated; conspiring to get your midterms canceled is much cooler. There’s plenty of bugs floating around campus — a few of which, unfortunately enough, live in my basement — so catching one should be easy. Maybe, when they see you hacking up a lung your professor will be so concerned that they will finally see the error of their ways and cancel your midterm. Recovering from the Plague of Harvard Yard might not be how you initially envisioned spending spring break, but at least your status as an academic weapon will remain intact. And (after recovering from their… umm… headaches) your classmates will thank you!
Pray to the Quad Gods.
If earthly forces can’t convince your professors to cancel your midterms, it might be time to involve some supernatural entities. Radcliffe College students technically haven’t had midterms in years — whether or not they’ve had classes at all is irrelevant — so the Quad Gods must be doing something right when it comes to saving students from severe emotional turmoil. We’re not saying you need to add the Quad Houses to your River Run itinerary, but maybe stop by the Quad Grille or Cabot Cafe to pay your respects before Housing Day. The Quad Gods don’t get a lot of appreciation, so a little politeness might go a long way towards making your wildest dreams come true.
Disclaimer: Flyby is not responsible and should not be held liable for any mental, physical, or emotional damages that may or may not arise from the use of these tips.
All jokes aside, the best way for you to prepare for your midterms is to take care of yourself. Take a break from Housing Day festivities to study, yes, but also to catch a few z’s. Nourish your mind, body, and soul at Brain Break, breakfast in Berg, and dinner in your House. Reward yourself for rewatching last week’s lectures, reviewing psets, or skimming your notes; every little bit counts. And, if all else goes wrong, trust in the curve and rest easy knowing that, at the very least, no one can force you to take a midterm over break. You got this!
