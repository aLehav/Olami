After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September, I had the opportunity to meet with, interview, and moderate a campus event for Sophia Chang, manager of the Wu-Tang Clan, Raphael Saadiq, and D’Angelo. I used to play "Voodoo” like a drug. We first met during Joey Bada$$’s lecture here and I recognized her hat from a YouTube video. She was partying it up in a place with light as yellow as her skin. She talked about smashing the box, enwhitlement, and micprogressions. She talked about the soundtrack of her life, which was no longer hip-hop because hip-hop was mad young, brimmed with youth, made by youth, angry as youth, fresh, new, changing, and overflowing with that I’m-going-to-hit-you-up-around-midnight-and-we-are-gunna-go-out sort of energy, and she said, “If you’re my age and hip-hop is still the soundtrack to your life, you are probably an asshole,” which was the first time I’d heard about the complacency of age in such definitive terms.
So I am interested in youth and the special breed of it that exists in yellow Americans, which may or may not be the force that brings people in our motherland to Botox and surgeries and skin rejuvenations, but is definitely the force that drives Eddie Huang to dress like a teenager and listen to hip-hop forever; David Choe, a millionaire at age 40, to roll up peanut butter and Wonderbread in a ball so he could “glue [his] stomach together”  in a hitchhiking show in honor of his teenagedom; and Wong-Fu Productions to keep making millennial cheesy romance videos. The way our public figures seem unapologetically young forever. The part of me seeded by nigahiga, kevjumba, JustKiddingNews, and all that YouTube. The memes and text-talk and colors that pervade Maggie Lee’s “Mommy.” That spring of gorgeous, insatiable language coming from Jenny Zhang’s poetry and essays, which can’t be traced to Morrison or Hemingway or Faulkner, but may possibly be traced to the way we talk to one another now, pop, contemporary and fleeting. Tech geeks and new money and fashionistas and foodies and Angry Asian Americans.
I was yellow in the way I was young, which is also the way I was free and the way I was drawn, the way I was perceived and the way I conceived myself. Because before I understood the weight of this country on my parents, I knew how to type by touch. Before I’d seen a photo of my mother in college, I knew how to be Ninja, Gangster, Emo, and Nerd in five easy lessons. My father converted to Christianity because to him, New Jersey reeked of uncertainty and evil. I stuck out in my half-Italian, half-Nigerian church trying to make the eyeliner fit right on my monolid. To me, I was born without precedence, because where was I going to sit on Rosa Parks’s bus? Where was I when Scarlet O’Hara cried to her mammy? Why did I need the history of this country if it didn’t need me?
I am orphaned because I was uneducated. Because my mother left her motherland with no intention of going back, I am an orphan born from orphans. I am defined not by my history or my hierarchical place or the legacy of my parents, but by my existence, which is my youth. Because I am grasping onto my mother’s hand, a quarter of her size, and she is learning from me how to be American. I learned from her how to be alive.
But can we be young and dumb forever? In some ways, Harvard has reminded me of that burdensome, overbearing youth that shaped my conception of racial identity, because what struck me most when I arrived was the same hollow lack of non-youth. It granted me the tangibility of an allegory, which I can share here.
A friend of mine ghosted a girl because he was three months deep and still hadn’t touched her. He took me to Kanye instead. TD Garden looked bigger than I thought it would. Kanye stood tiny on his platform and we felt light-years away. We sat because it was better than dancing. At midnight, a man stopped us on the street and tooth-smiled, called us Mister and Missus China. We laughed on and off the way back home.
That Tuesday, I saw Stephanie from Haiti who works in Lev, one of the only adults besides my parents who showed me a semblance of spiritual peace. I once this summer bought blueberries for her from the Business School and on a separate occasion wrote out Psalm 20 because she told me she loved my smile. She called me baby. She told me that the sun was too strong for my hair to be stuck to my neck like that. She spent Sundays at church, one of which was her pastor’s birthday, and I asked if she danced at church, and she said no, and then demonstrated how she lifted her hands so they reached to God. That Tuesday, I told her about Kanye, how late we were out ('til three) and how the setup was (fire) and how his speech about caring for people was (after the performance, before the encore, and kinda genuine maybe). I told her she would have loved it. She laughed like I was mad, then scolded me for being out in Boston so late, and I promised her I wouldn’t do it again and I wouldn’t have done it for anyone other than Kanye, and then I said someone called me Missus China, and she seemed more appalled than I had been.
Then she asked when I was going to go to church with her and I said next next week, but by then, I realized I lost the paper she wrote the address on and someone texted me that she was holding up a sign at that picket line, so I looked and looked and looked and haven’t seen her since.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 22, 2016, at 4:42 p.m.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana did not take a firm stance for or against the ongoing dining workers’ strike, instead saying he sees his role as minimizing disruption to House life.
“As a Faculty Dean, our primary concern is the wellbeing of our students, making sure that their needs are being met, their personal needs and nutritional needs, and essentially keeping the community together during this time,” Khurana said, referring to his position as Faculty Dean of Cabot House. 
In an interview Friday morning, Khurana directed questions about his stance on the now three-week long strike to negotiators from the University and UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union representing Harvard University Dining Services workers.
“I don’t have the full sense of information of how that fits into the larger University, how it interacts with other agreements the University has,” he said, referring to Harvard’s negotiations with the union.
“So I think that those questions are really better for those involved with the negotiations,” he added.
Over the course of months-long negotiations with Harvard, the union has sought to increase wages, guarantee summer earnings, and maintain the health benefits plan Harvard currently offers.
According to an email written by College Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba and forwarded by Lowell House Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck to her House list Thursday, “Mediation sessions continued [Thursday] and hopeful signs of progress were visible.”
While Khurana did not comment about his views on the negotiations, University President Drew G. Faust has previously voiced her support for the health benefits package Harvard has offered HUDS workers.
Days before the strike began on Oct. 5, Faust said she supported the health care plans Harvard put on the table—which would increase copayments and cut deductibles.
“We are actually very proud of our health benefits,” she said in an interview last month, adding that she finds the proposed health care benefits for HUDS workers and other employees at Harvard “kind of exceptional.”
Khurana said on Friday he thinks both parties are attempting to reach common ground.
“I believe everybody is making good faith efforts,” Khurana said.
He also offered praise for undergraduates, who he said have engaged in meaningful conversations around the “complex” labor dispute, and emphasized the importance of fostering House community during the protests.
House faculty and staff, including Khurana, have ramped up student programming since the strike’s start, often hosting events with food for undergraduates thanks to funding from the Office of Student Life. University spokesperson David J. Cameron said that Faust’s office has allocated additional funds towards similar events in the Houses.
In Cabot, Khurana has ordered food for students, including Burger King. Cabot's House Committee also hosted a dinner with $1,000 of pizza and chicken wings.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification: 
CLARIFICATION: October 22, 2016 
A previous version of this article indicated that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, in his role as Cabot House faculty dean, hosted a dinner with pizza and chicken wings. To clarify, Cabot's House Committee held the dinner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nothing is certain, especially not in college football. Just when one team appears to have all the momentum in its favor, a single play can change everything. The Harvard football team’s victory against Princeton (4-2, 2-1 Ivy) on Saturday epitomized this fact.
With less than two and a half minutes to play, the Princeton football team faced a fourth down at the Harvard 12. Down 17-10, senior quarterback Chad Kanoff completed the pass to junior quarterback John Lovett. As Lovett tried to power through the defense, he was stopped by junior linebacker Luke Hutton.
He gained five yards. The Tigers needed six.
A different adage about college football is that, in almost all cases, there are second chances. After Hutton’s stop, the Princeton defense shut out Harvard, and with 1:40 left to play, the hosts started their drive at the Harvard 24 after a long punt return. It took less than a minute for the Tigers to find the endzone, tying the game at 17-17 on a short run by Lovett.
Forty-nine seconds later, this matchup of Ivy League leaders was heading into overtime.
“I don’t think there’s any question that the momentum was going away from us,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Great comeback. We really struggled down the stretch…. We put way too much pressure on our defense.”
While the Crimson had momentum in the first half, Princeton seemed to have gained it all back as the game went into overtime. But the Crimson defense kept the team in the game just as it has done all season, stuffing the Tigers and limiting them to a field goal. On Harvard’s lone overtime possession, senior quarterback Joe Viviano dove into the endzone for the win.
The effort was enough to allow Harvard to escape Princeton, N.J. with a victory. After shooting to a 14-0 advantage early in the second quarter, the Crimson (5-1, 3-0 Ivy) withstood an intense comeback to claim the 23-20 victory and remain atop the Ancient Eight.
The game was a tale of two halves. The first half saw a dominant defensive performance by Harvard. The defense shut out a single-faceted Tigers attack that wasn’t able to get anything going in the passing game and had to rely exclusively on the run.
Harvard knew that the hosts would run the ball. Harvard stopped the run. Princeton didn’t score.
“[The defense was] heroic,” Murphy said. “Just heroic to stake us to a 14-0 lead. [Princeton is] always a challenging offense. They do so many things, so much motion and high-tempo. It’s very challenging, and it takes a little out of the attack mode since you have to be so assignment-oriented.”
However, momentum shifted in the second half. In the first drive of the third quarter, the Tigers opened up the passing game. After being shut out for 30 minutes, they drove 80 yards and narrowed Harvard’s lead by a touchdown.
The opening of the passing attack completely changed the game for Princeton. The Crimson wasn’t able to sit on the run as the team had in the first half. While the Tigers did rely on the run in the second half, the team incorporated more passes into drives and finished the game with 323 total yards, 172 on the ground and 151 through the air.
“I thought we were balanced,” Princeton head coach Bob Surace said. “I thought that’s important for us. When we’re playing well, we’re much more balanced, and the run really helps us.”
On the other hand, if there is one word that describes Harvard’s offense Saturday, it would be fickle. And as Viviano goes, so does the offense.
On the first drive of the game, Viviano did something he hasn’t done all season: He turned the ball over. On the second play of the game, the senior dropped back looking for senior halfback Anthony Firkser deep down the left sideline. But he under-threw the ball for the first pick of his career.
On the next drive, however, Viviano led the team 80 yards down the field, ending the attack with a touchdown to Firkser. The game was up-and-down for the signal caller as well as the offense. While he threw for two touchdowns and 215 yards, Viviano also tossed three interceptions, was sacked four times, and fumbled once.
“We got a little bit greedy at times,” Murphy said. “I think if we’d been a little bit more patient, then we at least could have put a few more points on the board, field goals at least.”
Princeton’s defense planned well for the Crimson. On top of the three interceptions and four sacks, the unit limited Harvard’s offense to 102 yards rushing. Playmakers like Firkser and junior running back Semar Smith ended with 22 and 20 yards, respectively. Sophomore receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley did rack up 82 yards receiving, but he didn’t score.
However, the limiting of key role players opened the door for newer faces to make plays. Sophomore wide receiver Adam Scott hadn’t caught the ball this season. That changed quickly this weekend. His first catch of the year came in the form of a 34 yard catch-and-run. And he day only went up from there.
Late in the second quarter, with the Crimson up 7-0, Scott grabbed a short pass down the left sideline. He flashed his speed as he outpaced a few Princeton defenders to the pylon, putting the Crimson up 14-0. Scott ended the game with 85 yards receiving and 23 yards on the ground.
“[It was a] great college football game,” Murphy said. “Princeton certainly didn’t deserve to lose. Great coaching job by them. Their kids played unbelievably hard. In the end, stating the obvious, we just made one more play than they did.”

It’s almost two months into the new school year, so by now we’ve probably all had our fair share of good and bad first impressions. Unfortunately, with class sizes  over 1,500 students, combined with other class years and professors, the social ordeal that is meeting new people at Harvard never ends. So what do you say after you introduce yourself with your name, dorm/House, year, and concentration? More importantly, what do you not do?
At a Party
It’s a Saturday night and you’re ready to unwind after a crazy week of midterms and psets. You’ve made plans to meet some friends, and then hit the quad to dance your problems away. Now comes the real question: how much do you have to drink? Harvard’s Alcohol Proof would of course tell you that your optimal buzz is reached with a whopping BAC of zero (argument being, who needs alcohol to have fun?), but in case you decide to raise that BAC up by a few points, just remember that puking on the dance floor isn't particularly a turn on. Worse yet, you don't want to be known as the kid who drank so much that you needed a visit from our friends at HUPD/Mt. Auburn. You definitely won’t remember that night, but everyone who saw you getting lifted into the ambulance will.
In your House/Dorm
Everyone always talks about how you get to know people really well when you live in close quarters with them. Naturally, this puts a lot of pressure on your roommates’ and entryway mates’ first impressions of you. Getting locked out of your dorm post shower, phoneless, dripping all over the hallway floor, and running into your hallway crush (or anyone for that matter) is probably your worst nightmare. You might be reading this and thinking, ‘This will never be me’ or ‘I have an ensuite bathroom - I'm immune,’ but we're here to tell you that you're wrong. It’s inevitable that this will happen to you at some point during your four years at Harvard, so listen up. When it does happen, we’d recommend perusing the hallways of your dorm fake laughing at yourself (because we all know you're dying inside) while you look for someone in your building to call HUPD for you. Definitely do not leave the building, and try not to wander around knocking on the doors of entryway-mates of the opposite gender. Most importantly, don’t drop your towel.
In the D-halls
If you’re a freshman, going into the Berg alone can be an intimidating concept. You get your tray, load up with food, and don’t see anyone you know in the lunch lines. Walking out to the tables, you see a familiar face, but you don’t remember his name, or how you know him, and it's just too late in the year to ask. Do you approach him? Wave? Pretend you didn't see him?
Do not do what we’ve all done and address him by what you think his name might be. Odds are, you’re going to be wrong, and will go on to realize that you don’t know this person after all. But at that point, you’re getting confused looks and have to explain why you thought you knew him and why you thought his name was Chris (some guy you sat next to at breakfast two weeks ago?). You’ll suffer through an awkward meal and by the end, you’ll just wish you never bump into not-Chris again.
Other Recipes for a D-hall Disaster:
Trying to eat spaghetti with meat sauce while wearing a white shirt. Your new friends will be more preoccupied watching the stains accumulate across your clothing than in listening to your side of the generic conversation.
Dropping your tray full of food. There’s always at least one kid to do it every semester…
Losing in an “odds are” game and agreeing to throw a banana as high as you can over your head. We guarantee that there will be at least one person (who unfortunately decided to sit two tables behind you) who won’t find the situation as funny as your friends do.
In a Professional Setting (internship/job search)
The limp, clammy handshake definitely goes down in the books as the worst first impression you could ever give (okay, maybe there have been worse, but this one is up there for sure). Your employers want to hire someone with authority and confidence. They do not want to be greeted with a hand that feels like a dead fish. Enough said.
Putting odd accomplishments and hobbies on your resume, like your summer working as a taxidermist or the fact that you’re proficient in ESP, is another no-no. We know Harvard students pursue all sorts of activities, but not all of them need to be known to your prospective employer.
At this point we have probably surfaced all of your worst nightmares and, trust us, they're even worse when they become reality. We’d tell you not to be that guy, but it’s inevitable–you will be. No matter what happens, keep putting yourself out there, because in the end, a bad impression is better than no impression... right?

With the recent addition of Crimson Cash, we all have been super stoked by the addition of money but not too stoked about the fact that everyone’s trying to spend it at the same time. At the same places. To help relieve stress about entering your favorite place only to find that you’ll need to wait for 30 minutes for food or a cup of coffee, Flyby has a compiled a set of recommendations for some of the most popular Crimson Cash spots around Harvard:
Lamont Cafe
If you are the the typical Harvard undergrad, you have spend some fraction of your Board Plus at Lamont. Unfortunately with midterm season in season, more people are finding themselves in Lamont with a ton of work and a deprivation of coffee so the line is a little too long and the cafe is a little too crowded at peak hours. We suggest getting to Lamont by 10 AM on the weekends and 2 PM during the week to snag your coffee and then snag a cubbie, so that you will be able to work in peace.
Barker Center Cafe
Since too many upperclassmen passed down the knowledge to freshman that the Barker Center is the best place to use your Board Plus/ Crimson Cash, the Barker Center Cafe has been more crowded than ever. The best thing to do in this situation is arrive early again - before any major eating hours, and especially before lunch. If you are planning on meeting people, advise one person to sprint to the Cafe and obnoxiously save a table for everyone. This thievery is the only way to guarantee you a secure spot in Barker.
Harvard Business School
If you are want to get a quick workout in so that you don’t totally regret the extra chocolatey mocha, the Harvard Business School Cafe is a perfect place to eat, study and feel even more sophisticated. The menu is very impressive and during the weekends, the seating area is practically empty.
CVS 
CVS has everything (with the exception of hot coffee). Why not stock up on enough snacks to hoard for the rest of the duration of the strike? (This actually may not be possible, but you can give it a try with $50). Take these snacks to any study spot your Econ textbook desires, and enjoy the day.
