After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Cause I, I, I’m in the stars tonight,” the video begins. A black screen gradually illuminates to feature BTS’ “Golden Maknae” Jungkook, clad in an orange suit and gripping an ultramarine sequined mic, crooning the opening lines to the septet’s latest disco-pop track “Dynamite.” Coordinated in orange and blue hues, the other members bob along to the beat. Band leader RM, with frosty cerulean hair and yellow tinted sunglasses, delivers his clean, emphatic rap as Jimin peppers the chorus with his distinctive high notes.
The group’s all-English song, which presents a departure from their characteristic Korean lyrics, delivers a markedly brighter sound than the broody, existential undertones of previous anthems from their repertoire including “Fake Love,” “Black Swan,” and “Interlude: Shadow.”
BTS’ appearance on NPR’s popular Tiny Desk series, now modified as Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts to accommodate quarantine restrictions, marks one of the band’s first public appearances since the cancellation of their 2020 Map of the Soul World Tour in late August. In keeping with pandemic guidelines, the septet performed in the private space of the Hyundai Card record store VINYL & PLASTIC in Seoul, South Korea.
The triumvirate of songs — “Dynamite,” “Save Me,” and “Spring Day” — presents a representative selection for both new and veteran ARMY alike. It is the band’s characteristically organic, endearing synergy that elevates the viewing experience: V throws his arm around a belting Jin’s shoulder as Jimin and J-Hope, on opposite sides of the studio, stand up and sway in harmony to the dying notes of the live band behind them.
Though the septet’s rendition of “Save Me,” first released in May 2016, provides ARMY a trip down memory lane, “Spring Day” drives home the expansive emotions and nostalgic intimacy of the performance. As soft vocal overtones open the acoustic rendition of the 2017 hit track, Jungkook reflects, “In such a difficult time like now, we all are wishing for the spring day to come.” The band’s mellow intro is punctuated by RM’s mumbling ruminations: “It’s been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come, so let’s go together.”
J-Hope opens the song with the lines, “Miss you / Saying this makes me miss you even more.” Toward the end of the track Jin sings, “Until the days of spring / Until the days of flower blossoms / Please stay, please stay there a little longer.”
The second-person addressee in “Spring Day” is, like many of the band’s most philosophical ballads, left intentionally ambiguous. It is the simultaneous intimacy and ubiquity of the band’s discography that have catapulted the septet to such dizzying heights; BTS delivers a unique sonic narrative while affording listeners the interpretive space to insert their own lived experiences.
In pre-pandemic times, the “you” in “Spring Day” could have been anyone and anything: an estranged lover or a long-lost friend, a late family member or a beloved city. Post-pandemic, however, in an era of collective vulnerability when life’s most mundane elements are thrown into disorienting relief, the metaphorical implications of the song’s simple lyrics shift and expand. Perhaps it is not merely another person or another place that BTS sings of waiting for but, rather, ourselves, or at least the portion of ourselves placed on hold by the surreal reality of Covid living.

The story of cable television in the 21st-century has largely centered around its ability, or lack thereof, to catch up with the oodles of streamable content millions currently have access to. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cable networks have had to relinquish the (nonexistent) nobility of live-studio broadcasting and adapt their most popular events — game shows, award ceremonies, and talk shows — to internet-friendly content and production. In other words, network television has entered the world of its more-popular online nemesis.
For the most part, this transition has been very rocky. Watching a late-night talk-show host riff into a webcam without a studio audience is akin to watching those clips of “Friends” with the canned laughter taken out: deliciously cringe-worthy, but not interesting enough to keep watching.
Award shows are suffering a similar fate as well, with Zoom panels and pre-recorded performances becoming the new interface for celebrity sightings. Lacking live music and the spectacle of well- or oddly-dressed famous people, award shows have been stripped to a point of being almost unrecognizable, where their central purpose — an incredibly partial celebration of Hollywood’s most successful — is made so blunt that it’s unclear why anyone enjoyed them in the first place. With the pomp and circumstance removed, the award show format has transformed from a glamorous night to an awkward PowerPoint presentation.
Criticism of the genre and its pitfalls isn’t exactly new. Of course, before 2020, there would be about 308 lukewarm takes around Oscars season proclaiming that The Oscars Are Vain And Everyone Should Hate Them and No One Is Going To Watch Them, followed by a full review about how terrible the Oscars were that year. Every fall and winter, Twitter exists solely to roast the fits on the VMAs red carpet, not laugh at the BAFTA hosts’ jokes, and keyboard smash when they accidentally give Best Picture to “La La Land.”
Yet, it's the stripping away of luxury, pre-shows, and big-budget productions that illustrates the real value of award shows: the conversations about art and media they foster among those who watch. The general idea of a privileged cohort of critics deciding what is and isn’t the best art of the year will always carry an air of critiqueable elitism, but the members of the voting committee aren’t the only ones involved in the process of making the shows happen. Heightened especially during the pandemic are debates about which film, TV show, or podcast deserves an award among the limited releases this year — and more critically, whether in a normal year they should reach the acclaim they have now. Can the Golden Globes go on as normal, or will Sonic the Hedgehog reach new heights in the award show circuit? Participation brings the awards show to life and saves it from being an event solely for self-important millionaires.
Casting predictions, spitballing memes, seeing favorite artists awarded for their work, being exposed to new movies, music, people, and more are all part of a cultural conversation predicated on the existence of some type of awards ceremony in the first place. For all their frivolity, awards shows — even the slideshows that they now are — play a part in keeping art alive.

Protest signs. Policemen in riot gear. A city courtroom packed to the brim. These are snapshots of the recently released "The Trial of the Chicago 7" trailer. Written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, "The Trial of the Chicago 7" portrays the violence of the protest that occurred in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the court proceedings of those accused of inciting it.
Originally an actor and playwright, Sorkin broke into cinema after selling the film rights to his courtroom drama "A Few Good Men." Since then, Sorkin has become critically acclaimed, including an Academy Award win for Best Adapted Screenplay for "The Social Network." He made his directorial debut more recently in 2017 with “Molly’s Game,” which was also nominated for an Academy Award.
From the looks of it, "The Trial of the Chicago 7" will join Sorkin’s extensive accolade-rich filmography with an all-star cast that includes Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jeremy Strong, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Alex Sharp, Mark Rylance, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, and John Caroll Lynch. The crew doesn’t disappoint either: “The Trial of the Chicago 7” has executive producer Walter Parkes, who has more than 50 film productions under his belt, and producer Marc E. Platt produced the Academy Award-winning films “La La Land” and “Bridge of Spies.”
Netflix recently closed a $56 million deal for “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” replacing Paramount Pictures after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down movie theatres. The film was originally set to be released domestically at the end of September, but will now be available for streaming on October 16. While the strong political currents seen in the trailer feel timely in the face of the Black Lives Matter movement, Sorkin had originally written "The Trial of the Chicago 7" screenplay in 2007, an idea that sprouted during a visit to Academy Award-winning director Steven Spielberg’s house.
“[Spielberg] told me he wanted to make a movie about the riots at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention and the trial that followed,” Sorkin said in an interview with Vanity Fair. “I left not knowing what the hell he was talking about.”
Though the screenplay for "The Trial of the Chicago 7" was ready 13 years ago, the project was delayed due to various reasons, including the Writers Guild of America strike that lasted 100 days starting in November of 2007. Sorkin wasn't announced as director until after "The Trial of the Chicago 7” was resurrected in 2018, and production of the film itself didn’t start until 2019, with filming in Chicago and New Jersey.
Sorkin shot much of the principal production on location, including in Hennesy and Hylan Hall on Fairleigh Dickinson University’s Florham Campus in Morris County, New Jersey. The director also used Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois as the battleground for the protests seen in the trailer.
"The Trial of the Chicago 7" is notably being released prior to the presidential election, and Sorkin draws on strong and unmissable similarities between political tension in 1968 and in 2020. Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the tense backdrop to the titular court case by using two handheld cameras to record the crowds of protestors, adding a tangible, documentary-esque dimension of violence between protestors and the police. All throughout the trailer for “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” chants of “the world is watching” can be heard. This rings true now more than ever. The world was watching then. And the world, more than ever, is watching now.

The new Netflix film “The Devil All the Time,” directed by Antonio Campos, tells the intergenerational story of the pious Russell family and the ominous characters that orbit its world. Based on the novel of the same name by Donald Ray Pollock, the film stars an ensemble cast helmed by Tom Holland, in a notable departure from his internationally renowned role as the lighthearted Peter Parker. Split into two parts, the first 45 minutes focuses on the Russell patriarch, Willard (Bill Skarsgård), as he comes home from World War II and starts a family in the small town of Knockemstiff, Ohio. The next hour and a half is set in 1965, and Willard’s son Arvin must tap into the violent tendencies his father instilled in him to protect his family. The intricate plot spans decades and includes a wide cast of deranged, corrupt, and, in very few cases, naively innocent characters. While the “The Devil All the Time” brims with talent, from mastered southern drawls to chilling sociopathic expressions, the unsympathetic characters and disjointed plot cripple the film’s potential to offer anything more than a long sequence of gratuitous violence and melodrama.
The film amalgamates elements of mystery, suspense, and horror, but ultimately lacks the characteristics that define the great films of all of these genres. “The Devil All the Time” eludes categorization in a way that is less groundbreaking and more lackluster and confusing. The first part of the film wades through war trauma, religious delusions, and deadly illness, and its pacing doesn’t allow for audiences to digest these back to back tragedies. However, Skarsgård easily slips into the increasingly deranged personality of Willard, a deeply flawed and sadistic person, making his character arc feel genuine.
“The Devil All the Time” has two additional storylines that are essential to the central plot but aren’t interwoven in a way that flows naturally. Back in 1950s Coal Creek, West Virginia, a preacher named Roy Laferty (Harry Melling) marries Helen Hatton (Mia Wasikowska), and his family collides with the Russells. To add to this already complicated plot, there is also a homicidal husband and wife that prey on innocent hitchhikers (Riley Keough, Jason Clarke), and the latter’s brother is a crooked cop in Knockemstiff (Sebastian Stan). It’s not necessarily hard to follow the film — there’s logic to all these interactions — but the overwhelming number of delusional sinners and dysfunctional relationships means you never get to know any of the characters as much as you’d like to.
Even so, Tom Holland is a strong lead as Arvin, carefully balancing the anger and violence passed down from Willard with his natural boyishness and muddled good intentions. He wants to stand up for his family, but he’s been taught that seeking brutal revenge is the only way to do so. When he confronts Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson), the new-in-town preacher that preyed on Arvin’s step sister (Eliza Scanlen), Holland readily taps into his vengeful side, with youthful fear subtly trembling under the surface. Pattinson, never one to conform to expectations, crafted his own Southern accent for the film instead of getting help from a dialect coach. The result was a high pitched, needling drawl that’s drastically different from his natural voice, and it accurately reflects his character’s contemptibility. His dark portrayal of Teagardin is a standout performance in the film, and watching him face off with Arvin evokes the high strung tension that it should.
Even with admirable acting, the storyline remains irredeemable by the end of the movie. There’s not much to get out of the disturbing imagery and excessive gore other than a few pictures in your mind that linger a little longer than you want them to. An austere tone persists throughout the two hour plus runtime, and the succession of tragedies and violent confrontations never quite amount to anything substantive. Nearly every character lacks morality in some way, and although this could be an effective commentary on humanity, it doesn’t come off that way; essentially, no one feels worth rooting for.
In the beginning of the film, the omniscient narrator (Donald Ray Pollock), while introducing Willard, says, “It seemed to his son that his father fought the devil all the time.” It would appear that this fight is shared by all the characters. It’s just hard to care if any of them win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I live in a city that’s big, but the sidewalks are small, and I run into people I know more than I would like.
It’s only in a fantasy that these meetings are anything but the worst. My twilight bodega purchases have never revealed unknown commonalities with my neighbor — only Nutella cravings I wish had remained hidden. I have never impressed anyone with my sense of fashion — just depressed them with my weekend sweatsuit. And I have never bumped into a friend with whom I accidentally lost touch – only those ex-friends I had purposefully ghosted.
I didn’t start out a misanthrope. With each of these meetings, I simply grew into it.
Friends would text to tell me that their mother’s brother’s cousin saw me on the street and waved, but that I didn’t wave back. Oh no! I would say. I didn’t see them… (And well, it wasn’t quite a lie. I would see them, and then I would stop at a bus stop or cross the street or stare at my phone to make sure that I really didn’t see them at the moment when they saw me.)
I have learned to avoid people with the best of them.
My city felt bigger and sadder and stranger these last six months — as masks and gloves first became common and then required, restaurants were closed and then opened onto the street, buses and subways were empty and then half full.
I should have run into people I knew more often; I was too caught up with my own errands and the pocket with my Purell and the fit of my mask and the distance between all of us on the now much-too-small sidewalks to scan and evade them. But they were too caught up as well, too caught up to say hello.
Everyone became a stranger. Even acquaintances.
I’ve moved onto campus since then. Now, I live in a city that’s smaller — somehow even the sidewalks are smaller — but I never run into anyone I know.
That feat is not thanks to my finely-honed skills of evasion or even to the preoccupations of a pandemic-era outing. I just don’t really recognize anyone here. To me, most of the Class of 2024 is still quite unknown.
Those I have met are only a disembodied head and shoulders floating in a tiny Zoom square. I recognize their preferred photo background or the placement of that ubiquitous silver dorm lamp in their video frame. I know the headphones they use and how likely they are to start speaking while still on mute. I remember how early they like to enter the Zoom room and how late they like to stay after class asking questions. But none of that niche expertise does me much good on the street.
To recognize someone, even to avoid them, I need answers to more basic questions of identity. How tall are they? What do their clothes look like beyond the shoulders? What backpack or bag do they carry? How do they walk? Or stand? Or talk without a slight transmission lag?
In fact, the other day, I ran into a classmate on the trek back from the Yard. We’ve been working on a project (via Zoom) in and out of class four or five times a week for the past month. I thought that maybe I recognized her. It turns out that she thought that maybe she recognized me. Neither of us said anything. We continued walking right next to each other — as close as good street social distancing etiquette allows — for blocks and blocks. I tried to pass her and avoid the situation altogether, and we made accidental eye contact. She said hello. It was the first time we had ever met in person.
But that experience is an anomaly. Mostly, I walk these streets without recognizing anyone and without anyone recognizing me.
And when I’m walking, and lonely, I miss those spontaneous city meetings. I want to renounce my misanthropic ways. And I’m asking all my classmates to do the same.
Please, students in the Class of 2024, wave to anyone who seems even possibly like another Harvard freshman. (And come on, it’s not that hard to recognize us around here.) Smile really hard, so that your eyes crinkle and your smile can be seen even with a mask. Make eye contact and wave with one hand — or if you’re really feeling the moment, wave with two.
And then, stop — on the street, in the Yard, around Quad lawn. Stop and talk, at least for a second.
Distancing is built into every aspect of life here, and, sometimes, it can feel like isolation is too. But it doesn’t have to be. We can still build community; the first step is actually easy. We just need to say goodbye to the misanthrope in us, and say hello to everyone — please.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dr. Gülnar Eziz seems eager to talk. As we settle down for our interview, she points out her Zoom background, a gorgeous image of sinuous, golden hills. It's a picture of the Tarim Basin in the northern Chinese region of Xinjiang, one of the most iconic natural landmarks of Dr. Eziz's homeland. Not that she is eager to use the region's name herself. In fact, she's quick to correct me: “So-called Xinjiang” she explains, means “new border” in Chinese. “It's really clear. It is a new border — for them.”
Dr. Eziz is a Harvard Preceptor in the Uyghur and Chaghatay languages. Her role at Harvard represents the careful balancing act that defines our University's response to the unfolding crisis in her native region; one that seeks to recognize the ongoing atrocities against the Uyghur people without ruffling any Communist Party of China feathers.
Her trajectory to our University is depressingly similar to that of other Uyghurs living abroad. She came to the United States to pursue the study of her native tongue in more depth, and witnessed from abroad as the Chinese Government’s crackdown on her people intensified. “All of my former professors are in jail right now,” she mentions at one point, adding that many of her colleagues have found the same fate “for no reason” other than studying a language and culture that have faced forceful suppression.
She last had contact with her family in December 2017, before they unilaterally severed ties. “‘Don’t call me anymore’ — that was the last words I heard from my dad.” The anecdote is as painful as it is typical — exiles and their families frequently become pawns in the game for control of the region, rendering any ties unsustainable. Whether they or any of her friends back home have ended up in the almost 400 internment camps across the region — where detainees have reported being subjected to torture, rape, and general “brainwashing” — she can’t say.
Dr. Eziz speaks gratefully about her experience with the University, lauding their decision to hire her. Being recognized by a prominent American institution “means a lot to Uyghur people,” she explains. Yet after speaking with her I couldn’t help but feel angry; frustrated that Harvard’s entire engagement with one of the most pressing humanitarian crises of our lifetime is limited to preceptorship. That and, of course, self-censorship designed to please the very government that’s brutalizing Dr. Eziz’s homeland, helping silence its critics. Harvard’s response to the Uyghur crisis — featuring covert appeasement and publicly celebrated but largely symbolic gestures in opposing directions — epitomizes Harvard’s more general, and deeply misguided, approach to engaging with political issues.
Our university prides itself on being apolitical. When confronted with the revelations regarding Harvard’s engagement with the Chinese government, Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s Vice Provost for International Affairs — who teaches an Uyghur language class himself — argued earlier this year: “[Harvard] does not take a political position on anything. It takes positions on matters relating to academic freedom.” We are merely spectators, you see; detachedly contemplating the course of world events, chiming in only when strictly academic matters are at stake. The notion that any institution with more economic (and arguably reputational) heft than most countries can be apolitical is inherently absurd; especially when said institution spends half a million dollars lobbying congress, has an entire school named after a (no longer so prominent!) political dynasty, and plays a significant role in shaping our politics.
Yet being apolitical has become an expedient excuse to do the bare minimum to uphold the values we presumably espouse; and our only clear institutional goal turns out to be the protection of our brand and of ourselves. Appeasing a borderline genocidal regime is perfectly acceptable, as long as it secures a mutually beneficial relationship — even if it requires silencing a couple of exiled civil rights icons. Apolitical censorship — yet another brilliant Harvard invention. Add in a (rightful and valuable) preceptorship that launders any public image issues, and you’ve got the perfect Harvard stance: noncommittal, vaguely encouraging, distinctly underwhelming.
Not that we couldn’t do better. Our students pave the path. Tzofiya M. Bookstein '23, one of the founding members of the Jewish Movement For Uyghur Freedom, argues that the University should evaluate any and all ties to corporations linked to forced Uyghur labor. The fact that Harvard’s very limited endowment disclosures can't even clarify whether we profit from genocide is not exactly reassuring (University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the matter). Harvard could even "use institutional power," Tzofiya adds, to "make a stand" on the issue. Her largely student-run group is eager to learn from the past, to, make sure “we don't become bystanders again." Yet Harvard seems keen on repeating its own 1930s insistence on polite coexistence with evil.
Dr. Eziz remains nostalgic and hopeful, eager to revisit Tarim Basin’s golden hills. She’s skeptical of the likelihood of the clampdown succeeding. As she explains, languages and ethnic groups might die naturally, but they can’t be forced to do so. “We will never disappear,” she adds.
One can’t help but wonder whether she’s wrong. Whether we might find ourselves in a future with nothing but empty hills and an atrociously ‘apolitical’ institution.

Last week, the Harvard Republican Club chose to endorse President Donald J. Trump for President. This decision is a telling about face from the club’s 2016 stance, when its members — dubbing Trump a “threat to the survival of the Republic” — offered a scathing rebuke of Trump and declined to endorse the Republican nominee.
The Republican Club has every right to endorse the candidate of their choosing; free country and all. But how they could possibly come to this conclusion — the day after Trump’s shameful debate showing, when their predecessors left them a blueprint on how to denounce Trump last election cycle — evades us.
The move strikes a nerve on campus. Hours before their announcement, when asked to denounce white supremacists, Trump told a violent white supremacist group to “stand back and stand by,” then mused that “somebody’s got to do something.” Not only is it impossible to separate an endorsement of Trump from tacit approval of white supremacy, it’s impossible not to see this endorsement as a provocation that willfully belittles other students’ identity and disregards their safety. At a time when a Harvard instructor is being credibly accused of defending neo-Nazi groups like Identity Evropa, the Republican Club’s endorsement serves as a further reminder that our campus is not devoid of those who engage white supremacy.
Their endorsement is telling of national attitudes towards Trump, particularly among educated young conservatives. In 2016, when declining to endorse a candidate, the Harvard Republican Club wrote that Trump’s “authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy.” A poll of club members found that an overwhelming majority — 80 percent — would not support Trump. It is on the back of stories like these that liberals have constructed a disturbingly stagnant narrative of Trump’s base that excludes educated young people. The Harvard Republican Club’s 2020 endorsement challenges the narrative of the “reasonable” Republicans — perhaps most obviously young ones, who are educated at liberal institutions — are turning against the president in disdain.
Polling evidence suggests that Trump is consolidating his support among young conservatives. 21 percent of 18-29 year olds backed him against Hillary R. Clinton, while 27 percent have backed him this cycle. These trends suggest Trumpism may well persist in elite conservative circles for a good while.
What made it into the Harvard Republican Club’s endorsement is also telling. Strikingly, concerns about authoritarianism are completely missing from the club’s statement this year — their paltry list of Trump’s “shortcomings” references only his failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and bemoans the broad loss of “dignity and distinction.” Though the 2016 Harvard Republican Club found then-nominee Trump’s “flirtations with fascism” disqualifying, concrete actions speaking to this concern — such as gassing peaceful protesters to snap photos this June and Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power — apparently do not phase the club’s 2020 incarnation. The absence of Trump’s COVID response from their shortcomings list was also felt loudly.
If the Harvard Republicans have learned to spout Trumpisms — the club’s statement included, word-for-word, campaign promises made in a Trump memo— that’s an important data point on how Trump continues to speak to a broadening base of Republican support. As young elites make peace with and even come to embrace his style and politics, an important, scary truth emerges: the Republican Party’s Trumpian elements will continue long after he does.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sent home three freshmen living in Mather House last weekend after finding that they hosted a party in the house with at least three other guests last month, according to five freshmen on campus with knowledge of the matter.
The students’ departure marks the first confirmed case of Harvard College’s Community Council disciplining undergraduates for violating its residential compact.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the College does not comment on the status of individual students.
Because all classes this semester are virtual, students sent home from campus may continue their coursework from afar. The College charges those students — who can be dismissed from the dorms for up to two semesters — room and board only for the portion of the year in which they lived in residence.
The decision also comes roughly a month after Mather House scheduled a meeting for residents to review the College’s social distancing rules. At the time, some students said their peers had held gatherings by the Charles River and in campus courtyards that appeared to violate those rules.
Mather tutor and community health lead Harita Koya wrote to students that the meeting would “clarify some misunderstandings about alcohol, partying, courtyard gatherings, compact violations, and disciplinary consequences.”
Before arriving on campus, the quarter of College students who are living in Harvard’s dorms this semester signed a “Community Compact” pledging that they would adhere to social distancing rules and safety guidelines.
The College also formed the Community Council — composed of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members — to enforce the compact and arbitrate alleged violations.
The Council may select one of four outcomes of increasing severity in the cases it adjudicates: a no violation determination, a warning, “community responses” like education, and — as in the case of the Mather freshmen — removal from housing.
Still, despite the dismissal of the undergraduates from campus, cases at the College remain low according to Harvard’s self-reported totals. Nine of the 21,669 coronavirus tests on undergraduates since June 1 have returned positive results.

Six female scholars from across the social sciences discussed the achievements and failures of the 19th Amendment Thursday evening in the third installment of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies’s event series “Voting Matters: Gender, Citizenship, and the Long 19th Amendment.”
Corinne T. Field, an associate professor of women, gender, and sexuality at the University of Virginia, moderated the event. The panelists included Cathleen D. Cahill, an associate professor of history at Pennsylvania State University; Sarah Haley, an associate professor of gender studies and African American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles; Mae M. Ngai, a history and Asian American studies professor at Columbia University; Reva B. Siegal, a professor at Yale Law School; Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute; and Dawn Langan Teele, an assistant social sciences professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Tracing how the 19th Amendment impacted historical discrimination against women along lines of gender and citizenship status, the panelists discussed topics ranging from voting rights to the lack of representation for women in government and politics.
Ngai explained that, even after the 19th Amendment’s passage, American women had limited independence: Their citizenship was tied to their fathers or husbands and they were stripped of their citizenship status if they married an immigrant man. The Cable Act of 1922 expanded women’s citizenship rights, Ngai said, but racial exclusions written into immigration and citizenship laws limited this expansion.
“Full assessment of women’s right to vote has to consider the relationships between citizenship, gender, race, and marriage,” Ngai said.
Cahill discussed the role “layered citizenship” played enabling Native American women to maintain both indigenous government and citizenship in the United States. Before 1920, Cahill said, Native American women advocated for women’s suffrage and established an audience in the political sphere; yet, in 1920, one-third of the Native American population was disenfranchised, affecting women in particular.
Siegal said that, though many Americans may see this year’s centennial of the 19th Amendment as a celebratory occasion, the amendment has failed women in matters related to race, citizenship, and familial identity in many ways.
“The 19th Amendment’s promise of equal citizenship remains unfinished business until we create an infrastructure that distributes and redistributes the burdens of care and dependent persons care across genders and in the community beyond family,” Siegal said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shelving dusty books, dishing up grill orders, leading patrons through Harvard’s art collections — in the coronavirus era, job-seeking students have found that campus mainstays are now defunct.
As students wade through an unfamiliar fall term online, they are also adjusting to a sparser campus job market. Some undergraduates lost employment and struggled to find alternative opportunities; others supplemented the gap with off-campus positions. For a lucky group, formerly in-person positions have effectively translated to virtual format.
During previous semesters on campus, Noah D. Dasanaike ’22 said he worked for Dorm Crew and as a shelving assistant in Widener Library. After classes moved online, Dasanaike said navigating the search for alternative job opportunities has been a “fend for yourself” kind of situation.
“Usually, there are a lot of research opportunities through various mediums at Harvard. And those seem to have dissipated,” Dasanaike, a Crimson editorial editor, said. “Maybe not in biology or chemistry or anything that involves actual lab work, but I feel as though they are very easily adaptable to an online format, so I'm not really sure why there's a lack.”
“It might be funding issues,” he added. “Some of the professors that I spoke with said that Harvard and a lot of universities right now have limited funding, and they don't really want to onboard any new employees.”
For those positions he did apply to, Dasanaike said he encountered irregular response rates or didn’t hear back at all.
After undergraduates abruptly evacuated campus in March, some said they struggled to secure remote employment to supplant their lost jobs, finding few available opportunities on the Student Employment Office site.
At the time, Harvard announced it would continue to pay students who can perform their on-campus jobs in a remote setting but asked students who cannot do so to seek other employment opportunities through the SEO.
Like Dasanaike, Liz E. Hoveland ’22 lost some of her on-campus jobs as the University transitioned to remote work — going from four Harvard positions to just one.
Hoveland’s former positions were highly varied: While on campus last semester, she bartended events through Harvard Student Agencies, assisted Leverett House’s building manager in the mailroom, ran social media for the History department, and worked as a digital media coordinator for the Harvard College department of communications. Now, based at home in Montana, she is working only the latter job.
“I am so lucky that I still can keep that,” she said. “It is the most phenomenal job ever. I love it.”
Hoveland said her hours dropped from 20 to 15 hours each week because the College made new student hires. Still, she said she appreciated the reduced workload since she is shouldering an extra class this semester. In normal times, she said she would “definitely” continue all four jobs.
“I wish that I could be bartending again. I really enjoyed it. The pay was phenomenal, and I got to get off campus and explore Boston,” she said. “And it's sad that I don't really get to be working for the Leverett building manager, who I love.”
While Cecilia Y. Zhou ’22, who has worked as a student tour guide at the Harvard Art Museums for a year, said she has been able to keep her campus job, though she noted that her billable hours dropped from 10 to seven this semester due to hiring freezes and budgetary restrictions.
“We obviously can't create as much or I can't be actively producing as much content as before with this kind of reduction in hours,” she said. “But other than that, though, the program has remained mostly intact.”
Some students reacted to the dearth of campus jobs by finding employment outside Harvard, though they have struggled with less student-friendly hours.
While she used to work at Lamont Library, Elena S. Vietri ’23 said she is now bouncing between classes and six-hour shifts at a Boston bakery.
“As soon as I understood that Lamont wasn’t going to reopen and we weren't on campus, I decided against a Harvard provided job,” she said. “Harvard jobs are kind of few and far between, especially with my field — [Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality] — and being a sophomore and having no research experience.”
“So I decided to make my job somewhat more of a passion as opposed to something that's going to further my resume,” she continued. “I've been baking for a long time and I really love the owner of these bakeries.”
Vietri said her schedule at the bakery is far more demanding than the one she maintained at Lamont, which allowed student employees to work anywhere between four to 20 hours per week. Vietri started off by working 24 hours each week at the bakery, which she said took a toll on her ability to complete coursework.
“I was able to get it back to 18 just for my own mental health and I have been okay with coursework since,” she said.
Other students have had smoother transitions, securing alternative Harvard employment or adapting their previous positions to the remote format.
Molly B. Goldberg ’22, who used to work in the materials acquisition department of Harvard’s library system, said she found a new remote research post.
“Obviously that's the kind of thing that you can't just do remotely,” she said of her job in the library. “You need to physically touch all the books.”
Goldberg’s new research post is a continuation of work she started with a History professor this summer. She is working 10 hours a week to help him make the works of Francesco Patrizi, a Renaissance philosopher, publicly accessible.
“There aren't really very many scholarly editions or translations that people can read, and so that we're trying to fill that gap,” she said. “The research job is really great, because I'm really interested in being an academic.”
Zhou also said her work at Harvard Art Museums has translated “smoothly” to an online format. Rather than give traditional in-person tours of the museum in person, the guides now lead guests through virtual visits.
“We've actually had a lot of success in embracing the affordances of the online format,” she said. “We've also been able to expand and grow our online presence.”
Student tour guides now offer informal online talks about different works of art. Zhou said one guide recreated a painting of a bouquet in person using real flowers. Zhou herself has filmed several make-up tutorials based on different works of art.
“It's certainly disheartening to not be able to be physically present in museums and to work with the art in person,” Zhou added. “But the attendees actually seem to be enjoying the virtual tours, and we seem to have a different and bigger audience than we did in person because the online format has the benefit of being accessible to anyone around the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government department chair Jeffry A. Frieden acknowledged a history of student mistrust in the department and reiterated the concentration’s commitment to inclusion in a Friday email to colleagues, in the wake of allegations that Government 50: “Data” preceptor David D. Kane made racist blog posts under a pseudonym.
Frieden called some material on the blog “deeply offensive,” citing the “pain and hurt” the posts have caused students.
“I abhor any speech that demeans, devalues, or belittles any student and any member of our community,” he wrote in his letter. “We are deeply sorry that many students have found the past week painfully difficult.”
Last week, students alleged that Kane authored racist blog posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog. They ultimately called for his removal in a petition that garnered hundreds of signatures from Harvard students, alumni, and organizations.
After Kane announced he would temporarily stop teaching until Oct. 13, Frieden and Dean of Social Science Lawrence D. Bobo jointly announced in a letter to students Thursday that Government professor Kosuke Imai will take over as the official head of Gov 50. They noted that Kane will nonetheless continue leading optional lectures.
Frieden wrote in his Friday note to colleagues that he believes the department landed upon a solution that “best serves all our students,” declaring that the “immediate educational demands” of Gov 50 enrollees are “apparently addressed.”
Frieden wrote that the department can now reorient its focus from maintaining academic continuity in Kane’s course to fostering an “inclusive environment” across the department.
“Over the past few years, we have been reminded repeatedly that many of our undergraduates and graduate students do not trust the Department of Government faculty to have their best interests in mind,” Freiden wrote. “We want to ensure that all members of the Department community feel appreciated, both for their common interest in politics and Political Science, and for their varied and often opposing views on the issues.”
He went on to state that “open discussions” and “academic freedom” are key to academic excellence.
Freiden also expressed gratitude for the Gov 50 teaching fellows, whom he had previously called “unprofessional” when they proposed that students not attend Kane's lectures to pressure the administration.
“These TFs, our other graduate students, and our undergraduates are likely to have found themselves under a lot of pressure due to the intense attention being paid to these events as they have played themselves out,” he wrote Friday. “I ask faculty and others to be sensitive to their concerns and supportive of their needs as we attempt to balance all of the University’s principles in the best interest of all concerned.”
Freiden concluded his note with another apology.
“I deeply regret and lament the pain and hurt that many members of our community experienced as the events of the past week unfolded,” he wrote. “Together I hope that we can work to make the Department a better place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services opened flu clinics two weeks ago as the University urges Harvard affiliates to get vaccinated ahead of a flu season expected to stress healthcare systems already burdened by COVID-19.
Many medical experts worry that two contagious respiratory diseases will circulate widely in the coming months, as flu season begins and the coronavirus pandemic persists pending approval of a vaccine.
HUHS Chief Medical Officer Soheyla D. Gharib wrote that this year’s flu shot is “more important than ever.”
“As we head into this year’s flu season, getting a flu vaccine is more important than ever to protect yourself and the people around you, and to reduce the strain on healthcare systems responding to COVID-19,” Gharib wrote in an emailed statement.
“Both the flu and COVID-19 are respiratory illnesses and they can lead to significant complications, so we strongly encourage everyone in our community, from faculty, students, and staff, to get the flu vaccine, regardless of where you are located,” she added.
Until the end of this month, HUHS flu vaccination clinics — located at the Science Center Plaza and the New Research Building in Longwood — are open to anyone with a Harvard University ID or enrolled in a University health plan. The Longwood location is open through Oct. 27 and the Science Center location through Oct. 29.
Students enrolled in colleges and universities in Massachusetts are required by state regulations to receive flu vaccination by Dec. 31.
To comply with the state mandate, Harvard students living on campus must be vaccinated by the year’s end, according to the HUHS website. Students in residence who do not adhere to the immunization requirements will have registration holds placed on their student accounts after Dec. 31 until they receive a documented flu vaccine.
Students living off campus, while “highly encouraged” to get the flu shot, will not be subject to registration holds if they choose to forgo vaccination, the website states.
“Students play a critical role in keeping our community safe, and we’re looking to them to help keep Harvard healthy by getting their vaccine,” Gharib wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Dean of Students Office has focused on helping student groups plan small, virtual gatherings as the COVID-19 pandemic and a scattered student body renders their marquee events impossible.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair explained in a Wednesday interview that residential community events have become main avenues for student engagement opportunities this semester.
“These large scale events like Yardfest type events just aren't possible in a remote way, so it's thinking about the smaller events and smaller ways to connect people who want to still meet other people,” O’Dair said.
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 added that house committees have organized events like Zoom trivia nights and “escape the room” challenges. They have also helped to plan a virtual sophomore orientation to welcome new students to their respective houses.
Since former Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller left the College, Kate T. Colleran, assistant dean of student engagement and leadership, has led the DSO’s student engagement team. She said she is excited about the adjustments the office has made to support student organizations, as well as foster student engagement in remote settings.
“We've pivoted all of our good things virtually, which is exciting and has been some new and different work,” she said.
Colleran added that much of her work this semester has centered upon “being more available to student groups,” as some of these organizations have faced logistical and financial hurdles in their transition to virtual platforms.
“We're still here to help them with their operations and organization, but it is a reality that a lot of them are just not excited about things as they usually are and so we're trying to keep some excitement,” Colleran said.
To help generate “excitement” for student groups, Colleran explained that her team is helping to manage the “minutiae” of student group logistics and shift to hosting remote events.
“Because so many of our student [organizations] just have these big trademark events that they do, a lot of the conversation is talking them through, if they can't do that in person this year, how do they do it virtually?” she said. “The team is really there to not come up with plans to replace theirs, but to help them figure out what they might want their plans to be or how they can be doing things in a different way and what might they be excited about.”
Alta Mauro, the associate dean for inclusion and belonging who began her tenure in the DSO this spring, said the virtual semester has challenged the DSO to address rifts between students at Harvard.
“I think I understand my role to be supporting Harvard in doing what it does: leading and modeling,” she said. “How can Harvard lead and model in this moment, and pull people together and cultivate the kind of community that is already referenced in a lot of our sort of lofty institutional language? How do we pull that rhetoric down and translate that into something that people actually feel?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council passed legislation calling for “student-friendly” grading policies that would extend the drop and pass-fail deadline and allow courses taken as pass-fail to count for concentration and general education credit in a meeting Sunday.
Quincy House representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22, Leverett House representative John E. “Jake” Leary III ’22, Lowell House representative Samyra C. Miller ’21, Currier House representative Jack M. Swanson ’22, and Currier representative Fernando Urbina ’22 sponsored the act, which resolved that the UC would publish a statement on Monday calling on the Educational Policy Committee to make these changes in light of the pandemic and an unusual semester.
The legislation cited similar changes made by peer institutions this fall such as Yale University and Princeton University to accommodate students affected by the pandemic.
“This is not a normal semester, and it is morally irresponsible to maintain a normal grading policy. Harvard can do better,” the legislation reads.
Cheng said the legislation prompts administrators to reconsider the current grading policies.
“Considering that a lot of peer colleges like Stanford and Penn have provided significant pandemic related flexibility to students, this was just a statement that was asking administration to look at what other schools were doing,” Cheng said.
Cheng emphasized that the changes — which would extend the deadlines to drop classes and change to pass-fail grading to Nov. 30 and allow courses taken as pass-fail to count for concentration and general education credit — would accommodate students who find themselves in difficult situations.
“This will give students more flexibility, if they need it to just switch classes to pass-fail or drop,” he said.
Cheng also stressed the timing of the legislation. The Educational Policy Committee, which determines grading models for the College will meet Tuesday, according to Cheng, and will not meet again until Nov. 17.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Educational Policy Committee was “committed to ensuring that students have a good academic experience this year.”
“I'm sure that they'll consider this proposal with great care,” she wrote.
The legislation passed unanimously.
When the College moved to online learning in the spring, students hotly debated the grading system that the College should adopt.
Council President James Mathew ’21 and Vice President Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 endorsed the “Double A” grading model, calling it “the most equitable academic solution.” The UC, however, voted for a universal pass grading model after a spirited three-hour-long Zoom call shortly afterward. A UC survey indicated that 19.3 percent of respondents were in favor of a universal pass-fail system, with 56.7 percent calling for the “Double A” model and 24.5 percent selecting the optional pass-fail model.
The College eventually implemented emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading, with the option for faculty to leave a qualitative assessment of a student’s performance.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in March that the policy “better meets the needs of the day.”
The College announced over the summer that grading would return to normal in the fall.
Cheng said the legislation would put the College in step with peer institutions on grading policies.
“We’ve seen that these other schools have made accommodations,” he said. “We’re asking them to look at it the same way.”
Correction: October 6, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the UC endorsed extending the add-drop deadline. In fact, the legislation proposed extending only the drop deadline.
Correction: October 6, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Michael Y. Cheng ’22 as citing "tier" schools. In fact, he said "peer" schools.

Harvard’s English department has developed a new online forum to discuss emerging issues and trends within the field of literature as the COVID-19 pandemic stretches into the fall semester and keeps the University’s scholars apart.
Called “LitLab,” the forum — which is open to all Harvard affiliates, including those on leave — meets weekly to discuss emerging issues and trends within the field of literature. The associate directors of undergraduate studies in English, Beth Blum and Leah J. Whittington ’02, spearheaded the effort.
The department first conceived of LitLab as a space to encourage exploration of material in a non-classroom setting, according to Blum.
“I think that the goal for us is to invite students to come and help shape the departmental culture, and to help them have a say in the conversations we have in the department,” Blum said. “I think it’s a breath of fresh air and actually kind of inspiring to get to think through something in a way that doesn’t feel stressful or doesn’t feel like a way to get a grade or fulfill an assignment.”
Over the summer, Blum and Whittington brainstormed the topics for weekly sessions — which range from podcasts to comedy to immigrant literature — in collaboration with a student advisory board of English concentrators, according to Iman G. Lavery ’22, one of the board members.
Lavery will be convening the upcoming session of LitLab, which will focus on accountability, “cancel culture,” and literature.
“I hope to have an organic conversation, where we can discuss how to decide if we cancel an author, or do we cancel a work?” Lavery said. “Or else, if there are sexist, racist, or homophobic portrayals of people in works that are seen as part of the canon or have literary merit, how do we decide what are the ethics of cancelling a work of art?”
The group recommends that attendees read or listen through 20 minutes worth of material, which may include online essays, short podcasts or video clips, and pieces of fiction and poetry, prior to each week’s session.
Sofia W. Tong ’21, another LitLab advisory board member, said LitLab allows students the opportunity to “see the other side of professors” by discussing works published mere months ago, rather than “really incredible texts that might not be as immediately relevant to daily life.”
“As an undergrad, there's not a lot of chances to interact with faculty or with other students in meaningful ways beyond the classroom, and I think LitLab has filled the hole of something that I really have felt has been lacking in my experience in the department,” Tong, an inactive Crimson news editor, said. “It really provides a place that's a nice balance between the sort of formality of office hours and class and the sort of complete unstructuredness of like a department barbecue.”
While the department developed LitLab, in part, as a means of strengthening departmental interactions between students and faculty during the remote fall semester, Blum said she envisions that the initiative will continue to meet in future semesters.
“I think both Professor Whittington and I hope it will become a recurrent part of departmental life,” Blum said. “In my dream, I would imagine us all sitting around with a coffee or a cup of tea and get to talk about these issues and questions together in an informal, in-person setting, which I imagine is how it will eventually manifest itself.”

A group of Cambridge activists are calling for a “community safety response program” grounded in rehabilitation as an alternative to local police amid a nationwide reckoning with law enforcement.
The group, “Community For Us, By Us,” seeks to engage Cambridge residents and train them in an array of social services, including deescalation, medical care, and peer support to resolve disputes and incidents in their neighborhoods without involving the police, according to Queen-Cheyenne D. Wade, one of the group’s founders.
Wade, who said she grew up in public housing in Cambridge, said her neighbors do not trust the police. She said she believes the police focus on punishment rather than helping people.
“These are all really important things that police might be trained in but [they] might not have ties to the community, or there already are certain assumptions or groundings with how police already act that can trigger people,” she said. “And so with how we want this to be trained is that everybody has their own specific responses and needs for when they’re harmed. And so that should be honored.”
“With the current system, it’s a Band-Aid over any issue,” Wade added.
Wade said she believes a safety response program led by Cambridge residents will be more effective at resolving issues than police. She pointed to cases in which local residents might call the police out of “reflex,” even in cases where police may be unnecessary or could escalate a situation.
In response to Community For Us, By Us’s demands, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. said that he is open to limiting the purview of the police in some instances.
“I am supportive of creating an alternate or non-police response for appropriate non-emergency situations involving individuals experiencing mental illness,” Bard said in a statement emailed by Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
Warnick stated in his email that the department has strong ties to Cambridge. He wrote that “a large majority” of the department’s officers grew up around Cambridge and that individuals who want to join the department must have lived in the city for at least one year before attending the police academy.
Warnick also pointed to the department’s “Family and Social Justice Section,” a program that offers a range of social services to individuals who could not seek access to care through the criminal justice system.
Cambridge City Council unanimously passed an order in June that favors “an unarmed Public Health and Human Services response” to non-violent calls.
“Unarmed alternative emergency response programs exist across the country that can serve as a model for Cambridge to develop a program that works for our community,” the order reads. The order adopted “the ultimate goal of decreasing arrests, increasing connections to critical housing, addiction and other services, and ensuring that Public Safety feels safe for all residents.”
After passing in the city council, the order went to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, who was tasked with planning program implementation. He is expected to present a report on the subject later this month, according to City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan.
Zondervan said that, though the City Council supports a community safety response program, its support may not be enough for the proposal to come to fruition.
“Unfortunately, the way our government is structured, there’s just no way you could compel the city administration to do more listening. Certainly as councilors we are elected, so we want to be responsive to our constituents,” Zondervan said.
“But all we get to do is ask the city manager to look into it,” he said, “And we certainly can’t control how much community input is behind these programs.”
DePasquale did not respond to a request for comment.
Wade said that she helped launch the group due to her and others’ concerns that their views are not valued by local government and agencies.
“We’re definitely thinking about our experiences and the experiences of people that we’ve talked to in the community,” she said. “Specifically around the experiences of youth in the community — we’re not feeling heard.”

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Cambridge city councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan authored an measure that favors “an unarmed Public Health and Human Services response” to non-violent calls. In fact, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon authored the measure.

The Association for Slavic, Eurasian, and Eastern European Studies hosted a webinar Friday on integrating critical pedagogies of race into course syllabi as a kick-off for its “Race in Focus” webinar series, which is co-sponsored by Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Friday’s webinar, entitled “Teaching Race and Racism: Your Syllabus 2.0.,” featured a conversation on how educators in the field can integrate racial frameworks into their syllabi by expanding course materials, incorporating new themes, sharing resources, and connecting with scholars of color.
Zsuzsánna Magdó, associate director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies, said the short-term goal of the webinar series is “to elevate conversations about teaching on race and continuing disparities in our field while also bringing research either from scholars of color or on communities of color to the center stage.”
Magdó said the series was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and aims to push its scholars to engage with race as an academic lens and confront institutional structures perpetuating systemic racism.
“We recognize that our regional studies are not immune from the challenges around understanding the impacts of structural racism,” Davis Center outreach director Cris L. Martin said.
On Friday, B. Amarilis Lugo de Fabritz, a Russian language instructor at Howard University, and Sunnie Rucker-Chang, a Slavic Studies professor at the University of Cincinnati, kicked off the discussion on critical pedagogies. Both presenters discussed how racial ideas have informed historical processes and broader conceptions of Eastern European nationhood. Anindita Banerjee, a comparative literature professor at Cornell University, moderated the conversation.
Lugo de Fabritz emphasized in her presentation how thinking critically about race and diversifying syllabi cause students to engage more deeply with course material.
“Because in the end, integrating these pedagogies will open you to surprise and discoveries. It will turn inclusion into a natural event,” she said.
Rucker-Chang spoke about how racial “frames of difference” can lend richness and perspective to Balkan and Southeast European Studies.
“What I want our students to do is engage with these traditional texts of Balkan Studies, of Southeast Europe, through this new lens of race — talking about Blackness, talking about whiteness, and talking about why we can frame conversations about these texts through race,” Rucker-Chang said.
In an interview after the event, Banerjee said she hopes audience members take advantage of the opportunities provided by the digitization of academic materials.
“Access is a lot easier, actually, but we need, as educators, to create the conditions,” she said.
She also underlined the importance of studying race not merely in today’s socio-political climate but also as a broader analytical medium.
“The topic of race is always simultaneously historical and contemporary,” Banerjee said.
Rucker-Chang, in an interview, also emphasized the importance of making use of current interest to promote impactful and continued action.
“It’s great that this is happening, but what do we do after this?” she said.
The “Race in Focus” series will continue to cover critical pedagogies, the experiences and successes of scholars of color, research on racial minorities, and the intersection between these fields and Black Lives Matter. Magdó ultimately hopes that “Race in Focus” will be a pilot for frequent future discussions on this topic.
The second “Race in Focus” webinar, “Engaging with Race and Racism in the Classroom,” will be held on Oct. 9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge announced Friday it will delay entering Step Two of Phase Three of Massachusetts’s reopening plan, after determining it would likely lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases in Cambridge.
Step Two of Phase Three of the reopening plan, which is set to take effect across the rest of the state Monday, will allow a number of sectors to reopen — including performance venues, gyms, museums, and libraries — all at 50 percent capacity.
Cambridge’s temporary emergency order will take effect Monday, delaying initiation of Step Two, and will remain in effect until further notice. A second emergency order limits the number of people in a single space in Cambridge to 50, whereas Step Two of Phase Three of the Commonwealth’s reopening plan would allow performance venues a maximum of 250 people.
In a joint statement, Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale attributed Cambridge’s status as a low-risk community to the City’s “more conservative approach.”
“After consulting with the Commissioner of Public Health, Chief Public Health Officer, and the City’s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Panel, we are delaying Cambridge’s advancement to Step 2 Phase III,” they wrote. “Cambridge remains a low-risk community in part because we have taken a more conservative approach to reopening than the Commonwealth.”
“Our priority is to keep our residents safe,” they added.
The press release also stated there has been “a small uptick” in cases in September relative to August, though the average number of new cases has remained relatively stable. As of Sunday afternoon, there have been a total 1,418 positive cases of COVID-19 and 100 COVID-19 deaths in Cambridge.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 3,982 new cases and 114 deaths in Massachusetts over the past seven days as of Sunday evening. Additionally, the Commonwealth reported an uptick in its COVID-19 positive test rate.
Claude A. Jacob, chief public health officer and director of the Cambridge Public Health Department, wrote in the press release that the City wants to assess the impact of the start of fall and the school year on Cambridge’s infection rate, before moving forward with the next step.
“Before we advance the City to the next reopening step, we want to look closely at the impact on our current infection rate as residents start spending more time indoors during the fall months and as K-12 schools start reopening to in-person learning,” Jacob wrote.

Like all college students, I am chronically tired. So in the spirit of caffeine that doesn’t remind me of the mandatory Sleep 101 Module’s anti-coffee spiels, I have taken to drinking all the tea available at the dhall. Yes, the dhall staff looked at me weird, and I felt like an incredible nuisance when I asked for one of each tea flavor during lunch. It was all so you could have this objectively correct ranking — don’t say I never did anything for you.
8) Constant Comment Black Tea
The only comment I have about this tea is that I don’t get it. Orange rind and sweet spice are unappealing by themselves and worse together. Drinking this tea felt like licking a bunch of orange peels then taking a shot of mystery powder.
Rating: 0 stars, and I’m being generous.
7) Earl Grey Black Tea
Maybe I just have Chinese-medicinal-tonic-for-cold-sores trauma, but Earl Grey sucks. My taste buds felt uncharacteristically fuzzy after one cup, and that’s not what I evolved for.
Rating: 0.1 stars. I’d drink this maybe in a desert where my only other option was dehydration.
6) Lipton Green Tea
Hot take: Green tea is not that good. Y’all just pretend to like it because matcha lattes are trendy now. But this green tea tastes exactly like the iced green tea from Bon Me, so you can save yourself $2.80 by making a hot cup of dhall green tea and waiting for it to go cold.
Rating: 2.5 stars because I’m pretty sure if I rate this any lower, the green tea/matcha latte fanatics are going to hunt me down.
5) Cranberry Apple Herbal Tea
This tea is ~quirky~. She’s not like other girls. All cranberry, no apple, this tea flavor tastes like warm, watered down cranberry juice with a slight rustic aftertaste of the dirt the cranberries grew from.
Rating: 3 stars. I like the taste of cranberries more than I dislike the taste of dirt, but not by that much.
4) English Teatime Black Tea
This is such a neutral flavor of tea that I drank the whole cup without ever registering a taste. Good for when you want a warm mug in your hand to remind yourself you’re conscious, bad if the La Croix of hot water doesn’t sound appealing to you.
Rating: 3.5 stars because somehow, the La Croix of hot water appeals to me.
3) Lipton Black Tea
It’s not called America’s favorite tea for no reason, even if it’s only my third favorite tea from the dhall. This is a solid, respectable black tea, but solid, respectable things are boring.
Rating: 4 stars, a solid, respectable rating.
2) Cinnamon Apple Herbal Tea
This tea is like perfume in that it smells exactly like cinnamon and apples but tastes nothing like either. Still, while it doesn’t taste like what it says it does, it tastes like fall, and I need that temporal reassurance of what season we’re in.
Rating: 4.9 stars. It would’ve been 5 but I’m still not over the ingredient deception.
1) Raspberry Royale Black Tea
The indisputable king of dhall teas; it’s not lying when it calls itself a Royale. If you don’t like this tea, you don’t deserve taste buds. I went to the dhall this morning and just asked for two of this flavor (dhall staff, please reaffirm my sanity).
Rating: 5 stars. Hell, 6 stars. 7. 10.
If you disagreed with any of these rankings, just remember that you’re wrong! For the rest of us with good taste: Enjoy your Raspberry Royale!
