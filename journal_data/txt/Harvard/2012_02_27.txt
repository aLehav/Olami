After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, in a surprising move, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the affirmative action case Fisher v. Texas. The case concerns Abigail Fisher, a student who claims that she was denied admission to the University of Texas because she is white. The last time the Supreme Court issued a ruling on affirmative action, in 2003, the justices found that public universities could use race as a factor in the admissions process. Since then, the court has become considerably more conservative, and it appears increasingly likely that affirmative action will be rolled back to some extent when the court hands down its decision.
Harvard has historically endorsed the use of race-based affirmative action in admissions decisions. Now, the University has once more stated its support for the practice, and it is likely that the administration will file a brief with the Supreme Court to formally vocalize its support for affirmative action. We applaud Harvard’s stance on this issue and hope that the University does all it can to preserve affirmative action as a valid, and valuable, component of admissions.
Nearly 50 years after the peak of the civil rights movement, minorities still face numerous institutional and structural disadvantages in America. On average, African Americans and Hispanics still earn far less than their peers, and tend to come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Minority students who are able to succeed in spite of the disadvantages they encounter should be recognized for their achievements, which is precisely what affirmative action allows colleges and universities to do.
In addition to leveling the playing for disadvantaged students, affirmative action allows colleges to ensure a diverse student body. A plurality of backgrounds and opinions is, in our consideration, a vital component of any learning environment. Of course, race should not be considered the only measure of diversity, or even the best. However, it is a necessary part of the picture that admissions officers consider when they gauge how a candidate will contribute to discourse on campus.
The extent to which race should be weighed as a factor in admission is a subjective matter, up to the discretion of the admissions office. In this sense, there any other number of admissions criteria that are just as subjective, such as what part of the country a student comes from, whether or not a student has legacy status, and the essay a student submits with their application. If the Supreme Court decides to do away with race as a factor in admissions decisions, it might as well mandate that schools only accept candidates based on strictly objective criteria, namely grade point average and standardized testing scores. It is our firm belief that Harvard’s holistic approach to admissions is preferable to any alternative system, and results in a stronger student body.
Of course, the only thing at stake in the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision is affirmative action. But these stakes are large. Without affirmative action, we would run the risk of regressing to the days when only those from elite backgrounds could attain elite educations. We urge the Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action, and Harvard to stand firm in its courageous support of a valuable practice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Club of Boston is a private institution whose members include Harvard graduates, student, faculty, and family members. It is not affiliated with Harvard University, but the university hosts many events there, including a “Saturday of Symposia” with President Faust last December. For more than a hundred years, it has been an institution for the elite of the elite. The Harvard Club of Boston has two locations, the main club in the Back Bay and a smaller location in the Financial District. The main location has hotel rooms, banquet halls, squash courts, and conference rooms for business and social functions. 240 people work there as housekeepers, servers, front desk attendants, and cooks.
These workers are represented by UNITE HERE Local 26, the same union that represents Harvard’s dining hall workers. Like Harvard’s workers, Harvard Club workers have spent the majority of 2011—and now 2012—bargaining a new contract with management. However, unlike the university’s dining hall workers, they have been met with an unbelievable lack of respect for the bargaining process on the part of Club management.
Last summer, we attended several bargaining sessions at the invitation of the workers. We were appalled by management’s disrespectful attitude toward the workers’ negotiating committee. Many of the Club’s employees are immigrants who support families in multiple countries, and they are asking for nothing unreasonable—just enough to get by. Given the physical and mental demands of service work, it is unacceptable that some of them must take second jobs to pay for their medical bills and their kids’ clothing and food.
According to data provided directly by management to the union, of the 240 workers, fewer than 90 have health insurance through the Club. According to data from the Mass. Division of Health Care Finance and Policy, 57 club employees and another 76 of their dependants receive taxpayer-subsidized public healthcare. Furthermore, 68 percent were paid less than $30,000 in 2010, of whom 43 percent were paid less than $10,000.
Given that the Harvard Club continues to host extravagant events such as the “Champagne and Sparkling Wine Walkaround,” and taking into account the high cost of living in Boston, we believe that times are tougher for the workers than they are for the management. When some 35 workers visited a meeting of the club’s Board of Governors in October to ask for the Board’s intervention, we found that group of influential Harvard alumni enjoying sushi in a wood-paneled room.
Some months ago, the Club, in a stunning example of arrogance, attempted to charge the union a fee for holding negotiations at the Club. (Several months later, the Club cancelled this bill). They were, though, kind enough to include a menu featuring a $46-per-person lobster strudel lunch with the bill and suggested that the workers order from it while bargaining. During this time, they refused to propose even small wage increases to the workers.
We have witnessed bargaining sessions in which the club has engaged in regressive bargaining—reducing wage or benefit proposals they had previously themselves proposed.  For example, several months ago the Club responded to a reasonable wage proposal the union had presented as a compromise, by lowering their own previous proposal. Also, from February through August 2011, management repeatedly refused to share important financial information, leading the National Labor Relations Board to issue a federal complaint against the club in October for “failing and refusing to bargain collectively.”
Adding insult to injury, Club employees have alleged in a recently filed class-action lawsuit that the Club has pocketed gratuities added to each Club bill and has also kept a significant percentage of contributions made by Club members to the employees’ annual holiday fund. The allegation that the Club’s management appears to have been acting deceptively toward its members and deprive its workers of much-needed income only underscores the unsavory nature of labor relations at this institution.
Although the Club is not legally affiliated with the University, it bears the Harvard name and draws most of its membership from the faculty and student body. As students, we have in the past called on our university to practice responsibility and transparency in its relations with workers and community members.
The Harvard Club is not exempt from these values, and we would be embarrassed to belong to a Club that shows such blatant disregard for its workforce. Thus, the Harvard administration should put pressure on the Club’s board to demand that the club promptly settle a fair contract in good faith.

CORRECTION APPENDED
This weekend, Harvard will host the One State Conference, a gathering of academics and activists from around the world that will address the possibility of a one-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The speakers, including noted Harvard faculty as well as many others, will explore what it would mean for the Holy Land if its citizens could shelve ethnic and religious nationalism in favor of coexistence under a secular, bi-national government where all would have equal rights.
Never heard of the idea? You’re not alone. Despite gaining steam among Israeli and Arab intellectuals alike, the one-state solution is rarely discussed in the halls of power or in the U.S. media. Zionists have long insisted that a “Jewish democracy”—in a land where Jews number 5.4 million, compared to 11 million indigenous Palestinians—is a possibility. But the democratic notion that all people in the land of Israel might have equal rights and equal voices does not sit well with a state that values human beings according to their "Jewishness.” [SEE CORRECTION BELOW]
This Conference will move beyond the nationalist paradigm that each nation or ethnic group needs its own national or ethnic homeland, and will explore the possibilities of the creation of one democratic and secular state that would allow both peoples—Israelis and Palestinians—to live together in peace.
In the 1990s, White South Africans realized that they could not continue to control the indigenous people and dispossess them of their land against their will. Instead, they dismantled the system of apartheid and agreed to live as a minority with equal rights in a land that both they and South Africa’s other minorities considered their homeland. Numerous veterans of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, including Bishop Desmond M. Tutu, and have visited Palestine and made it clear that Israel’s system is in fact “worse than apartheid” as it existed in South Africa. [SEE CORRECTION BELOW]
Palestinians, Israelis, and many others around the world are waking up to this fact, and support is increasing for the one-state solution. A 2010 poll found that around a quarter of both Israelis and Palestinians support the establishment of a single, bi-national state, while another quarter support a unified confederation. With support for this option increasing on all sides, it is vital that policymakers, scholars, activists, and the general public explore this option and debate what a bi-national state could look like, even as we keep other options open.
For 62 years, Palestinians have been subject to ethnic cleansing, occupation, and dispossession across their homeland. In 1948, Israel declared its independence and promptly expelled 800,000 Palestinians from their homes, occupying 78 percent of the land of Palestine in the process. In 1967, they occupied the rest. Today, out of a total of nine million Palestinians in the Middle East, just over half live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, under Israeli siege in Gaza, or with second-class Israeli citizenship. The other half live mostly in squalid conditions in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan—all within a few hours driving distance of their former homes. Since their original dispossession, Palestinians have fought—both violently and nonviolently—to regain the right to live in freedom and dignity in the land they continue to call home.
Over the years, Palestinians have compromised with Israel’s regime, asking only that they be allowed an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza (or 22 percent of historic Palestine). Despite this compromise—originally accepted by Israel in the 1992 Oslo Accords—the Israeli government has continued authorizing the building of settlements in these areas, which have been held under military occupation since 1967. Israel has built a wall around its settlements that cuts through Palestinian villages, making 43 percent of the West Bank off-limits to Palestinian inhabitants in the process. It has even created a system of Jewish-only roads that bypass Palestinian villages to ensure that life for the over 500,000 settlers feels normal and uninterrupted while Palestinians struggle to live under a military occupation and have their movement restricted by hundreds of military checkpoints.
Increasingly, it seems that Israel has made the dream of a Palestinian state encompassing even the West Bank and Gaza an impossibility. Though the Israelis and the Palestinians (and most of the world) negotiate peace with the idea of two states for two peoples as a basis, the reality is that this would be extremely difficult to achieve because Israel has continued to colonize much of the land that would have comprised a future Palestinian state.
Because of this, the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee is excited to co-sponsor the One State Conference at Harvard from March 3-4, 2012. It is our sincere hope that the One State Conference will be an innovative, unprecedented academic forum for discussing the potential of the one-state solution. We hope it will inspire Harvard students and visitors alike to consider the many different possibilities for peaceful coexistence that lie before us in the Holy Land.

CORRECTION: The  op-ed "Fighting Apartheid with Equality," published in the February 27,  2012 edition of The Crimson and co-authored by Lena K. Awwad, Eliza M.  Nguyen, and Alex R. Shams, misstated the number of Palestinians who live  in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The number of "indigenous  Palestinians" living in Israel and the Palestinian territories is  estimated at approximately 5.5 million, not 11 million as stated in the  article. The 11 million figure was the authors' estimate of the global  Palestinian population. Also, the population of Jews living in Israel is  widely estimated at closer to 6 million, not 5.4 million. Furthermore,  Desmond R. Tutu cannot be found on record stating that Israel's  relationship to the Palestinians is or was "worse than apartheid," as  claimed in this article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The popular press is obsessed with the idea of elite college students going to Wall Street.  Just last week, the Washington Post’s Ezra Klein wrote that elite students are still going to Wall Street because their liberal arts educations have left them with no marketable skills. Thus, businesses swoop onto campus and snatch up these confused children. They market their contract as a risk-free Excel boot camp. At worst, students spend two years working at a breakneck pace with one hell of a business card to flash at high school reunions.
The conversation shows no signs of ending because despite the national scorn heaped on the financial sector during the past year, students are still going to work there. The New York Times reported that 17 percent of Harvard students, 14 percent of Yale students, and 35.9 percent of Princeton students from the class of 2010 went into the financial sector. We can quibble all we want about these figures, but they do suggest that more students are going into finance careers than who actually like finance.
Current thinking on this issue has moved away from the “money” factor, but the conversation should return there. Existentially torn students do not turn the “Career Wheel of Fortune” and land on “Goldman Sachs” 17 percent of the time. They go to banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, and other black boxes of investment because they offer $120,000-plus starting compensation.
All the other reasons people provide, “opportunities,” “surrounded by smart people,” and “exit options,” can be traced to money or delusion. People want “opportunities” to make money. The idea that finance is the only sector where you can be “surrounded by smart people” is both elitist and incorrect. If “exit options” were truly important then students would more closely interrogate whether their older peers have left the financial sector for public service.
Does this mean that Harvard students are greedy baby vulture capitalists who see nothing more on the fifty-year horizon than an Upper East Side penthouse, summers in the Hamptons, and a “couple of Cadillacs?” This is an offensively simple narrative. Instead, it would be more accurate to say that students crave Wall Street’s money because they want to retain the place in America’s upper class that they secured with a Harvard admission.
It is impossible not to think about money at Harvard. Everywhere you look, you see the benefits of having piles and piles of cash. Green is not at all the “new” Crimson. It’s the foundation of the school: the marble halls of the library, the new Mac computers in every building, the ornate dining halls, the post-375th birthday party grass implants in the Yard, the incredibly generous financial aid. To say that there isn’t security in being awash in such luxury would be a lie. Moreover, all this wealth signifies something: we have earned a place in the upper class of this country. After four years at Harvard, leaving this cultural echelon and living remotely close to the way the average American lives is a frightening step down in comfort and prestige.
Furthermore, leaving behind this lifestyle might mean leaving behind many of your Harvard connections. If you’re in I-banking and I’m a teacher, can we still afford to be friends? This isn’t a trivial concern. The building blocks of friendship are often financial transactions. Everything from the restaurants we frequent, to the events we attend, to the clothes we buy is a marker of expense. Many of us will move to New York, D.C., or Silicon Valley post-graduation, three of the priciest areas in America, so this concern is all the more relevant. Evan T. R. Rosenman ’12 wrote in The Crimson of the jarring experience of living with summer roommates who spend much more or less than you do. He concluded, “In just a few years, we will all leave this school with the privilege of an Ivy League education, and the associated earning potential….How we choose to “use” our privilege—by spending lavishly or living abstemiously, donating graciously or forgoing money to spend time with loved ones—will play a major role in defining our identities.” Not having and spending money could make us very different from the people whom we’ve grown to care about throughout our college careers.
There is no easy solution to the issue of elite students going into lucrative careers that don’t necessarily benefit society. Like everyone else, we find it much easier to continue a lifestyle than change it. But perhaps a measure of relief can be found in the liberal arts education—that beleaguered institution that Klein dismissed as useless. A liberal arts education is supposed to make us realize that sharpening our instincts for empathy and exploring different worldviews is a reward in itself. It’s about all the good things that life can offer besides class security. True, trying to sell glorious poverty at Harvard is like selling abstinence in Las Vegas. Still, perhaps a true Harvard education can free us from the trap of the Harvard lifestyle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An education study co-authored by two Harvard professors found that top teachers increase students' lifetime income and standard of living, confirming the commonly-held belief that a single teacher can transform a student’s life.
According to the study, high value-added teachers—or those in the top 5 percent as measured by test scores—produce students who are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, live in better neighborhoods, and save for retirement. The students are also less likely to get pregnant as teenagers.
The study, titled “The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood,” was published in December by Economics professor Raj Chetty and Kennedy School assistant professor John N. Friedman and Jonah E. Rockoff of Columbia.
The research examined 18 million 3rd through 8th grade test scores in English and math drawn from 1989 to 2009 and compared the data with tax records to determine outcomes. A teacher’s “value-added” was determined by averaging his or her test score gains during the academic year, and the scores were adjusted for differences such as students’ previous scores.
The data was obtained from a large, diverse public school district that encompasses neighborhoods of differing socioeconomic statuses, Friedman said.
The research suggests that value-added assessments of teachers effectively predict long-term outcomes.
According to the study, “Replacing a teacher whose VA is in the bottom 5 percent with an average teacher would increase the present value of students’ lifetime income by more than $250,000” on average.
“If you’re concerned about growth, especially in a global economy, you’re concerned about making U.S. workers competitive,” said Chetty. “Investing in education, especially at the elementary level, makes a lot of sense.”
The study’s findings add to the debate over education spending and reform.
Friedman said that teachers should be evaluated like other high-earning professionals.
“If we want to pay teachers $100,000, we should treat them like people in other professions that are getting paid six figures,” he said. “We should evaluate performance, we should give feedback, we should improve them as much as possible, we should richly reward those who are successful, and we should improve performance among those who are not doing so well.”
Yet Friedman noted that test scores not the only means of evaluation.
He suggested combining tests scores “with other things like principal evaluation, classroom observation, peer evaluation, and student evaluation” in order “to put together as rich and as accurate a picture of each teacher as you can.”
The study’s findings have attracted significant attention, and was the subject of a column in the New York Times by Nicholas D. Kristof '81-'82.
Allison R. Kimmel '12, Director of Advocacy at Harvard Students for Education Reform, said the study shed light on the importance of effective teachers.
“People don’t realize that teachers have these long-term effects on students,” Kimmel said. “We think that teachers matter for one year to make sure students master content, but great teachers are able to affect people’s lives long after they leave the classroom.”

Harvard faculty expressed mixed opinions over the role the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should play in supporting junior faculty’s research endeavors as federal funding for scientific research continues to diminish.
“Science is an expensive business...funding is tight,” said Andrew Berry, assistant head tutor and lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. “This is especially true I think for junior faculty, because to a certain extent, their record is judged on their success in bringing money to the lab.”
FAS provides start-up packages for junior faculty to begin their research. The packages vary depending on the school, department, and discipline, and are negotiated on an individual basis.
“We work very hard to identify the best junior faculty that we can get, and what we have to do is [support them],” said John E. Dowling, professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology.
The government has increasingly transferred responsibility for junior faculty funding to individual institutions, according to Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Richard M. Losick.
“It’s my impression that we make very competitive offers when we hire junior faculty, and we are able to meet their needs with generous start-up packages,” Losick said. “It’s often the case now that since the bar is so high for junior faculty, they need start-up packages that can carry their research program for several years before they are competitive enough to win a federal grant.”
Though the start-up packages help individuals start their labs, junior faculty often have to look beyond university funding in order to supplement their research needs. According to Dowling, the start-up package will usually fund junior faculty research for one to two years. After that, they are expected to obtain funding from external sources.
The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and private agencies are largely responsible for outside funding for junior faculty.
“It is certainly the individual faculty member’s responsibility to sustain his/her own research program with grants once it has gotten started,” said Eric N. Jacobsen, chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department.
As government funding becomes more difficult to obtain, Jacobsen described it as increasingly “tight and less predictable.”
Despite increased difficulty in funding junior faculty, Losick said he thinks it is still crucial to increase the size of Harvard’s tenure-track contingent in order to replace retiring senior faculty.
“We would like more [junior faculty]. It’s certainly an issue for us,” Losick said.
But the issue of funding in the science, he said, extends beyond Harvard.
“There is concern about the future and about science generally in the United States,” Losick said. “I think most people would agree that the U.S. doesn’t have anything if it doesn’t have innovation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supermodel and host of “America’s Next Top Model” Tyra Banks graduated last week from the Harvard Business School’s Executive Education Owner/President Management Program.
The program is designed to help executives learn how to become more effective leaders and deliver greater value to stakeholders, according to the HBS wesbite.
In order to complete the program, Banks was required to complete finance, leadership, and marketing courses.
Banks, who enrolled at HBS last year, posted photos of her graduation on her Twitter account on Thursday. The picture included the caption, “Smiling ear2ear on the Harvard Business School campus w/ my diploma! Tnx 2 my fab photographer mama 4 the pic!”
Banks, who dropped out of Loyola Marymount University at age 17 to pursue a modeling career, has said she hopes that her graduation will inspire others.
“On Twitter and Facebook, a lot of people comment about wanting to go back to school,” she told Businessweek Magazine. “It used to be that 80 percent of what I’d hear was about beauty and body image. Now it’s about education and empowerment.”
Around 100 students and faculty were invited through a lottery to hear Banks speak on Feb. 14. During the talk she also spoke with HBS Professor and Senior Associate Dean Youngme E. Moon in front of audience members.
“I’m not looking to build my company based on fans,” Banks told the audience, according to the HBS Harbus. She said that, instead, she wants to build a sustainable business that is based on a message of self-esteem and empowerment.
“Don’t chase the money, even if you want to be a banker,” she added. “Chase the passion. Chase the dream.”
Despite the conclusion of her time as a student, Banks will be remembered within the HBS curriculum.
Professor Rohit Deshpande is preparing a case study on Bankable Productions, Banks’ independent film and television production company, to be incorporated into future coursework for the Executive Education Owner/President Management Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ann Allosso says she was really too old for this type of thing.
Every Friday this past summer, the 73-year-old Allosso slipped flyers under doors in the Chapman Arms apartment buildings—a total of fifty units, four floors, and one rickety elevator. Every Monday, Allosso—who calls herself “the mother of the building”—led the meeting advertised on the flyer in the Chapman’s lobby.
Each week they discussed the same issue: The Chapman Arms building, located on Mt. Auburn Street, was on the market for the first time in nearly three decades, and it seemed likely that the building’s new owner would eliminate Chapman’s affordable housing units.
Chapman had been a mixed-income housing complex since 1986. That year, 25 units became affordable units, rented out at a markedly lower cost, while its twenty-five other apartments remained at market price.
When the Chapman went up for sale last year, the building’s location attracted many potential buyers, eager to turn a profit. Tenants like Allosso, unnerved by the circling would-be landlords, were afraid that they would be displaced from their homes.
“I didn’t have the least bit of hope,” says Allosso, who has lived in the same reduced-rent apartment at Chapman Arms since 1986.
But last month, Harvard, which owns the land on which Chapman sits; the city of Cambridge; and Homeowners Rehab, Inc., a local nonprofit dedicated to preserving affordable housing, banded together and forged a plan to save the building by preserving it under Massachusetts’s Chapter 40T, extending the guarantee for affordable housing for 50 more years.
According to Allosso, residents were overjoyed when they heard that Chapman would retain its mixed-income status, a resource made scarce in Cambridge by the multitudes of individuals seeking it.
“We needed a quick engagement between Harvard University and Homeowner’s Rehab, and from my mouth to God’s ear, that’s what happened,” Allosso says.
“THE CRAIGIE”
Situated next to a Harvard office building and across the street from the Mt. Auburn post office, Chapman Arms looks like most of the buildings in Harvard Square: red brick, white trim, historic, nondescript. With its entrance tucked away on one of the Square’s many side-streets irrelevant to undergraduate student life, the Chapman is effectively in the Harvard bubble but at the same time out of sight. Vines have climbed their way up the building’s brick facade, and the number four is the building’s sole mark of identification.
But Chapman’s innocuous appearance belies the diversity of its residents and the building’s storied past.
“We have Muslims, we have Ethiopians, we have students, the elderly, the young. We have everything,” Alloso says.
Alloso adds that mixed-income pricing makes the Chapman Arms community especially diverse. Most of its market-rate tenants are students at the Harvard School of Education and Harvard Business School. Tenants in low-income run the gamut from retirees to young immigrant families.
Chapman has a long legacy of providing affordable housing in the Square. In the early 1900s, the building served as an undergraduate dormitory, containing 36 apartments, to provide affordable housing to students.
According to an article from the Cambridge Chronicle, published on October 2, 1897, “The Craigie is a dormitory for Harvard men, so designed as to meet the needs of those who desire comfortable quarters at a low price.”  At that time, Chapman Arms was often called “The Craigie.”
The building was designed by Josephine Wright Chapman, one of the earliest woman architects in America, earning it a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1963, a serial killer known as the ‘Boston Strangler’ murdered his tenth victim in Chapman Arms, stabbing 23-year-old tenant Beverly Samans to death in her first-floor apartment.
Harvard officially acquired the building in 1967. Back then the building was loud, Allosso says, and the tenants kept their doors open. “It was a hippie building—it was a mess,” she says.
In 1985, Harvard evicted the Chapman’s tenants so that it could renovate and turn the structure into mixed-use housing, giving each tenant relocation assistance and a cash reward. The University bought the land on which Chapman Arms sits that same year and sold the building itself to Cambridge Housing Associates, namely senior partner Robert J. Kuehn Jr.
During the sale, Harvard stipulated that the building would rent 25 units at market rate and 25 units at a discounted rate for affordable housing tenants.
But the guarantee of affordable housing would not last forever. The sale contract only required that the owner offer affordable housing units until 2016.
And as that deadline approached, investors keen to make a profit off of the building prepared to pounce.
FIGHTING TO PRESERVE
Low-income housing at Chapman became threatened in the wake of a funeral.
On June 15, 2006, Kuehn died in his office on the first floor of Chapman Arms. Kuehn, who had been the Chapman’s steward for 20 years, bequeathed his share of the building to a pool of 30 investors.
In spring 2011—nearly five years after Kuehn’s death and five years before the affordable housing requirement would expire—the investors listed the property with a broker.
But investors did this without informing the residents, and this decision was found to be in violation of Massachusetts’ Chapter 40T, a law designed to help preserve affordable housing.  The listing of the building was delayed, giving Cambridge the time needed to devise a plan that would ensure that Chapman would remain a mixed-income housing complex.
“Chapter 40T was instrumental in the preservation of Chapman,” Chris Cotter, Cambridge housing director says. “It allowed us...[the time] to put together a credible preservation plan with a credible offer.”
Allosso started holding meetings in Chapman Arms’ lobby late last spring. Allosso and eight other tenants attended a June Cambridge City Council meeting in the hope that the Councillors would come to their aid.
After the meeting, then-Mayor David P. Maher sat down for tea and a conversation with the residents in his office, Allosso says. Maher gave them hope, informing them that he was going to lunch with “someone from Harvard.”
Later that summer, Harvard and the Cambridge Department of Housing and Community teamed up to preserve the mixed-income apartments. They sought the help of Homeowner’s Rehab, Inc.
The three hammered out a deal and finalized their plans late last month. Harvard extended its ground lease—requiring affordable housing be preserved for at least 50 more years—and facilitated HRI’s purchase of the building.
Cotter says Harvard was “instrumental in coming to the table.”
“They could have said no,” Allosso says. Still, she thinks Chapman Arms’ physical proximity to the University made the affordable housing debacle a problem hard for Harvard to ignore. “We’re a feather in their cap, we’re in their neighborhood. How could they turn us out?”
PAYING THE RENT
Allosso estimates that if Chapman Arms had not preserved its affordable housing units, it would have taken four or five years for her to be placed in a new affordable housing unit.
The housing prices are, in part, due to the fact that Harvard—the wealthiest University in the world—makes Cambridge its home, creating high demand for apartments.
“The demand is incredibly strong,” Cotter says. “The waiting list is well over 10,000 folks.”
A Cantabridgian working for minimum wage would need to work 120 hours a week to affordable a rentable apartment in Cambridge, according to a study done by Homeowner’s Rehab, Inc.
But over the past century, Harvard has played a big role in enabling and funding affordable housing in Cambridge.
Over the course of the 1900s, Harvard sold 100 housing units for one-third of the market rate to Cambridge for affordable housing. In 2000, the University created the 20/20/2000 program that designated $20 million for a 20-year affordable housing low-interest revolving loan. This program has helped to finance one out of every six units built in Cambridge and Boston. Harvard is also adding additional affordable housing units in Charlesview Apartments in Allston.
Harvard says their involvement in preserving Chapman Arms signifies a deep commitment to the community.
“The preservation of twenty-five affordable units at the Chapman Arms is an example of Harvard’s significant commitment to support affordable housing and the quality of life in Cambridge and Boston,” wrote Christine Heenan, the University vice president for public affairs and communication.  “Harvard strives to be a supportive partner to local leaders who are champions of a diverse and healthy community.”

A fire in a dormitory on Harvard Business School’s campus in Allston on Sunday evening caused an evacuation of the building but no injuries, according to news reports.
The fire, which was linked to a short circuit in an outlet on the fourth floor of the building, caused more than $150,000 in damage to the building, according to the Boston Globe.
The damage resulted both from the fire and from flooding due to the water that extinguished the flames.
Boston Fire Department spokesperson Steve MacDonald told the Globe that “the water was coming through all the ceilings and floors” of the three floors below the room where the fire started.
All students displaced in the fire will be offered housing on campus by the University, according to news reports.
MacDonald did not state the cause of the short circuit.
The Globe reported that the fire broke out in Building No. 6 of the Soldiers Field Park apartment complex.
The dormitory complex, which was built in 2001 to house Harvard graduate students, contains 478 apartments as well as a child care center, according to the Harvard Campus Services website.
A fire at a different Harvard Business School dormitory in 2009 caused over $100,000 in damages, displaced dozens of students, and injured one firefighter.

Investors are critical to social entrepreneurship, panelists said Friday at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics.
Teams of Harvard Innovation Lab students also presented seven entrepreneurial ideas at the event.
Investors will only provide funding and support for a social entrepreneurship project if they believe it has a realistic goal, as well as a comprehensive plan of action, said panelist Christa A. Velasquez, a Senior Fellow at the Hauser Center.
“Investors want to see something more than the idea,” Velasquez said. “They want to see you doing what you say you’re going to do.”
In order to have the greatest impact and affect the most change, social entrepreneurs must work together as a team, said panelist Bill Drayton ’65, the chief executive officer and founder of Ashoka, a not-for-profit organization that invests in solutions to social problems.
Social entrepreneurs need characteristics that encourage them to work towards solving social problems, said Dayton.
He described social entrepreneurs as “people who are in it for the good of it all.”
“When you tear down the walls between business and society, you get a gigantic explosion of productivity,” Drayton said.
Seven teams of students from the Harvard Innovation Lab presented their ideas, which ranged from ending veteran homelessness in the United States to investing in farmers in Sri Lanka.
One team sought to promote literacy in developing countries by providing e-readers, called Kumba Readers, to children. By reading books, these children would gain credits that they could exchange for resources for their families.

The Harvard Kennedy School will become a smoke-free campus starting March 1, Executive Dean John A. Haigh announced last week.
The Kennedy School will join the Harvard Medical School and Business School in enacting a comprehensive prohibition of smoking anywhere on its grounds and within 25 feet of building entrances and windows.
“We make this move to promote good health and to reduce any impact from smoke upon our staff, faculty, and students, following decades of research on the negative impacts of smoking and second-hand smoke,” Haigh wrote in an email to students and faculty.
Another major impetus to go smoke-free was the U.S. Green Building Council’s recent changes to certification requirements, according to Jeffrey L. Martin, director of the Office of Facilities Management at the Kennedy School.
The USGBC’s new policies make green building requirements much more stringent, which would have prevented several HKS construction projects from receiving green certification if the school had continued to allow smoking on its grounds.
Martin said that there was no vocal negative response to the policy change from either faculty or students, and that the transition to a smoke-free campus should be a smooth one.
“The biggest obstacle will be with executive education and guests,” said Martin, in reference to the large and diverse body of international visitors that the Kennedy School frequently hosts.
In an effort to enforce the new rules, no-smoking signs were erected on Feb. 27 and Harvard security guards in the area were instructed to give information cards to smokers infringing upon the new ban.
The smoking ban comes at a moment when College administrators and House Masters are considering the adoption of a university-wide ban on smoking, a topic which they discussed last Thursday night at a Committee on Student Life meeting.
The Kennedy School’s ban may be an indicator that anti-smoking efforts have gained momentum on campus, and that the Harvard community may see similar regulations spread across the University in the future.
The ban is preceded by a 2008 research paper co-authored by Harvard professors David M. Cutler ’87 and Edward L. Glaeser, which suggested that workplace smoking bans could have a multiplying effect.
“Individuals whose spouse faced a workplace smoking ban were less likely to smoke themselves.” wrote Cutler and Glaeser.
According to their research, an individual is 40 percent less likely to smoke if a spouse quits smoking, results which support the Kennedy School’s efforts to reduce smoking on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students from the eight Ivy League universities learned about practical approaches and effective tools to fulfill their leadership roles at their respective undergraduate institutions at the 12th Ivy League Leadership Summit this weekend.
Student organizers said that this annual summit, which was held at Harvard this year, is part of an effort to increase collaboration and communication between Ivy League universities.
“Our overall goal is increased Ivy League interaction,” said Kathy Bui ’12, president of the Ivy Council from Brown University. “We want to bring together all the Ivy League schools so we can pool our collective resources and make students aware of how much support they have.”
The conference featured a series of keynote speakers including social entrepreneur Bill Drayton ’65, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology lecturer Andrew Berry, and John W. Coleman, a Harvard Business School alumnus and co-author of “Passion and Purpose.” All three spoke about personal experiences that imparted valuable lessons on effective leadership.
“The goal for this conference was to increase Ivy League interaction with an emphasis on personal development,” said Teddy O. Tiab ’12, who organized the summit as Harvard’s Ivy Council head delegate. “I wanted each student to walk away either with a new perspective or a new skill, which is why we chose a varied list of guest speakers.”
Students also had the chance to attend a series of workshops on Saturday that featured presentations from guest speakers including Google University Programs Manager Debra LoCastro and Mark D.W. Edington, the executive director of the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory.
Students said that popular workshops in the conference included “Speaking Your Mind and Minding Your Speech,” “Team Problem Solving,” and “Case Studies in Leadership Failures.” Workshops featured team-building exercises and group discussions.
“In a workshop led by Dale Carnegie Training, we talked about engaging in a meaningful conversation with somebody and making a memorable impact,” said Grace Phang ’14, a student from Dartmouth College. “We learned techniques to get someone to open up and make them feel special—skills that all great leaders need to have.”
The conference, arranged by the Ivy League Council and the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, received generous donations from Google, the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College, and the Harvard Undergraduate Council.
Ivy League Council members said that they expect that next year’s conference, which will be held at Dartmouth University, will continue to grow in attendance. Future plans include seeking official club status for the Ivy Council at Harvard and improving publicity for the event.
The Ivy Council is also currently organizing a “State of the Ivy” address at Columbia University this April, where student government presidents from all the Ivy League schools will come and share what they have been doing at their colleges.
“If there was a philosophy behind why we do this, I would say that we want students to gain new perspectives and new skills,” said Tiab. “We want to empower young leaders to go back to their college campuses and make a difference.”

The Harvard women’s basketball team was debilitated by 24 turnovers Friday night at Jadwin Gymnasium, as they fell to Princeton (20-4, 10-0 Ivy), 74-44. The Crimson’s two-dozen turnovers plagued Harvard all night, leading to nearly half of the Tigers’ points.
“If you turn the ball over 24 times, you get less shots, you get less possessions, and the other team [gets] more chances.” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “The pure statistical downfall of having so many turnovers is that you’re not able to get back in the game.”
Only shooting 33.3 percent in the contest, Harvard (13-11, 6-4) struggled mightily on offense.
“We weren’t getting the ball in the hands of the right people to get the shots that we wanted,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Berry led the Crimson with eight points, while junior Miriam Rutzen and sophomore Elise Gordon added six points apiece for Harvard.
“I have always [thought] that when defensively we could put it on the floor that we have enough people to make it happen offensively.” Delaney-Smith said. “Not last night. We were just out of sorts offensively.”
Tough defense kept Harvard in the game for most of the first half. After Princeton opened the game on a 9-0 run, the Crimson chipped away at the deficit with a couple of baskets from Berry and a three-pointer from sophomore Christine Clark, narrowing the gap to four a little over halfway through the first frame.
Harvard did not threaten for long. The Tigers responded with a 13-0 scoring spree to bring the score at halftime to 32-15.
“It was close for most of the game, especially in the first half,” junior Victoria Lippert said. “They didn’t have a huge lead on us until they started scoring transition buckets.”
“I, for the first time, was really really pleased with our defense.” Delaney-Smith added. “I don’t feel that Princeton scored in the half court but once or twice in the first half, and then we just had a rash of inexplicable turnovers.”
The Tigers were able to notch 14 points off of fast breaks and 35 points off of Crimson turnovers.
Though Princeton tallied point after point Friday night, Harvard played solid half-court defense and pulled down 34 rebounds as a team. Junior Elle Hagedorn was able to grab eight rebounds of her own, three of which came on the offensive end of the floor.
“We really knew that the only thing we had to do was to take care of the ball on offense and to just attack the boards.” Berry said. “It’s unfortunate because we knew what the problem was, we just couldn’t make the adjustment.”
“When we would go to run our offense, we would turn the ball over,” Delaney-Smith continued. “It definitely came down to turnovers in my opinion, and I think it was a mindset unfortunately. We should have fed off of great defense because our defense was really good.”
The Tigers immediately came out of halftime with a 9-4 scoring run. Princeton lead stayed around 20 for most of the second half, with the Tigers sinking 42 points to Harvard’s 29 in the half. Princeton’s Niveen Rasheed and Lauren Edwards led the scoring for the Tigers, netting 16 and 17 points, respectively.
“Any time [Banghart] took her starters out, she would put them right back in again because we were able to get little runs of momentum,” Delaney-Smith said.
The Crimson bench—led by Gordon and freshman Erin McDonnell—provided some late offensive spark for Harvard, as Gordon knocked down six points and McDonnell was able to notch five. Freshman Ali Curtis also came off the bench to force two quick turnovers for the Crimson.
But its late efforts fell well short as the buzzer brought an end to the 30-point defeat. Despite the loss, the Crimson stayed in second place in the Ivy League standings thanks to Yale’s Friday night loss at Columbia.
A postseason bid in the WNIT tournament remains in reach for Harvard depending on the remaining games around the Ivy League.
“I think it’s just a matter of taking it one game at a time.” Lippert said. “You can’t hang your head for a long time in this league.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two years, Harvard’s top skiers, sophomore Rebecca Nadler, junior Alena Tofte, junior Catherine Sheils, and sophomore Chris Stock, have made several breakthrough performances to put the Crimson jacket in unfamiliar places, most recently on the top of the alpine podium last weekend.
But this weekend, it was the supporting cast leading the charge, with Harvard getting boosts from new faces in its ninth place finish at the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championships, hosted by Middlebury.
On the Nordic side, those jolts of energy came from freshman Akeo Maifeld-Carucci and junior Esther Kennedy. Maifeld-Carucci took 15th place in Saturday’s 20k classic race, his best finish of the season. Kennedy impressed in the skate event with a 17th-place finish in the 5k free event.
“She’s jumped up quite a bit [this season],” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “That reflects a lot of technique she’s been doing on the skate side and a lot of hard training and also just coming at it with a really good competitive fire. She came into this season really looking to make a mark, and she’s pushed herself. There’s a group of skiers fairly close together. Last year she was at the back of it. This year she’s at the front end of that group.”
As usual, leading the charge in both women’s Nordic events was Tofte, the only skier on the Nordic side to qualify for the NCAA Championships. The junior placed ninth in the 15k classic and ninth in the 5k free.
“She was leading the [15k] race for a little while,” City said. “She’s comfortable she can ski there. I think it bodes well; I think she could have a really good NCAAs.”
Stock came into the weekend two spots away from a trip to Montana for NCAAs, but his 40th in the 10k free and 31st in the 20k classic were not the finishes he needed to move up in the standings.
But while Stock may not have been able to advance in the EISA Championships, his season as a whole was one where he was consistently within striking distance of the top group of skiers.
“He was skiing consistently in the top 20,” City said. “Last year we were jumping up and down when he made the top 20.... I’m really proud of the way he worked all last summer. He made a huge jump in his skiing. He was not even close [to NCAAs] last year; he was right on the cusp this year.”
Meanwhile, the women’s alpine team got a boost from freshman Cate Kistler’s 16th-place finish in the slalom. Kistler was the top Crimson finisher in that event, with Nadler’s 19th good for second. Sheils, meanwhile, was on her way to a good run when she hooked a turn and took herself out of the race.
“She’s been skiing so fast,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. “Her results have not been indicative. I just feel really bad for her. It’s a bummer; sometimes it’s just how it goes.”
Nadler led the charge on the giant slalom with a 12th place finish. Mitchell noted that the flatness at the beginning of the course disadvantaged the small Nadler, especially with a stiff headwind.
“Not to make excuses, and I know she won’t make excuses, but it’s probably the worst course for her,” Mitchell said.
The finish put her second in points for the season behind the University of Vermont’s Kate Ryley, also a sophomore. Ryley won both the giant slalom and the slalom, and the Catamounts won their second straight EISA title in a row.
“If you’re going to lose to someone, [Ryley’s] the real deal,” Mitchell said. “She’s really, really good.”
Ryley and Nadler will face off next at the NCAA Championships.
Meanwhile, Mitchell noted that the skiers on the men’s alpine side had solid runs. In Friday’s slalom, senior Kevin McNamara led the way with a 56th place finish.
“Kevin McNamara had a great first run,” Mitchell said. “In the second run, he took himself out in a really difficult section. It definitely would have been one of his better results.”
In the giant slalom, sophomore Ian Anderson was the top finisher with a 48th place finisher.
“In the first run, Ian Anderson hooked his arm inside the gate,” Mitchell noted. “In his second run, he skied his best run of the season. It was kind of nice for him to end on a strong note with a really solid second run.”
Junior captain Andrew Spielvogel was out with a shoulder injury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up 59-58 with 34 seconds to play in the second half of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s rematch against Princeton, junior Kyle Casey found himself at the free throw line—a similar position to the one he was in two weeks ago at Jadwin Gymnasium.
But while late free throws proved deadly in the Crimson’s first matchup with the Tigers—Casey missed four of five free throws down the stretch in Harvard’s eventual loss—the junior forward came through in the clutch on Friday night, knocking down both attempts.
“Last game [against Princeton] I was terrible from the free-throw line, and it was awful,” Casey said. “I’ve been in the gym since two weeks ago working on my free throws. Coach told me, ‘You’ll get another shot at it.’ And it just so happened that [Friday] was the night. I just stepped up with confidence.”
Casey led his team with 20 point on the night, going five for six from the foul line and an 7 of 13 from the field.
“Kyle definitely carried us,” said junior point guard Brandyn Curry. “He and Keith are the focal points of our team. He played well, but that’s what we expect out of him.”
But while Casey’s free throws helped build the Crimson’s lead, it was co-captain Oliver McNally who secured the 67-64 win from the line. The senior guard, Harvard’s top free-throw shooter, nailed six free throws in the final 18 seconds after Princeton sent him to the line on three occasions in an attempt to extend the game.
“Oliver is just a great leader for our team,” Casey said. “He’s a vocal, emotional leader. He always comes through and produces, knocking down free throws and big threes.”
McNally’s shooting stroke gave Harvard a six-point lead with three seconds to play. And although Tigers’ guard Doug Davis nailed a half-court buzzer beater, the shot came too late for Princeton to stage a comeback.
FRESH TO DEATH
In such a tight contest, the bench’s five points—all of which were scored by freshmen—proved crucial. Rookie Steve Moundou-Missi was two for four from the field and contributed six rebounds for the Crimson, three of which came on offense.
“He’s done that for us,” Amaker said of Moundou-Missi’s performance. “That’s what we expect, him to be able to come off the bench and give us [what we need]. Those are winning plays; offensive boards keep the possession alive.”
Fellow freshman Wes Saunders added two assists and one point for the Crimson on Friday night in 15 minutes of action.
“[Wes Saunders] didn’t really have the numbers but [he played well] defensively...when we called on him,” Amaker said. “I thought he was outstanding tonight…. He was ready when he came in. I thought that was a huge statement for his future in our program.”
The two rookies had a big impact on the team, helping Harvard outscore Princeton in the paint, 34-28. The Crimson was also able to capitalize on the Tigers’ slipups, collecting 15 points off turnovers to Princeton’s eight.
“The freshmen really came in and played well,” Casey said. “They [came up] big for us in both halves. It was a gutsy effort from everyone.”
THREE TIME
Led by forward Patrick Saunders’ perfect shooting effort from the field in the first half, Princeton shot  62.5 percent from beyond the arc. Patrick Saunders knocked down all three of his three-point attempts and added a mid-range jumper. He and Casey led all players in scoring in the first frame, netting 12 first-half points apiece.
But Patrick Saunders attempted just one more shot for the Tigers in the second half, finishing the game with the same 12 points he scored before halftime.
“Our defense has been our calling card…. That’s something our kids believe in,” Amaker said. “Obviously they missed some shots. That happened last year as well.”
Princeton shot better from three than it did overall, going 47.1 percent from deep and 46.3 percent from the field on the game.
Harvard, on the other hand, struggled from three-point range, especially in the second half, knocking down just one of its seven attempts from deep. The Crimson had fared slightly better in the first half, hitting three-of-nine attempts from long range.
“[Princeton is] a very good team with their offense and the things that they do,” Amaker said. “I thought we dug in, and that’s something I’m proud of. We had a lot of energy and effort in the comeback.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong 5-3 win against Princeton on Friday, the No. 8 Harvard women’s hockey team topped the Tigers again the following day, completing a two-game sweep over Princeton in the ECAC quarterfinals with a 4-3 overtime victory Saturday afternoon at Bright Hockey  Center.
Harvard (22-8-1, 17-4-1 ECAC) looked like it could seal the win in regulation, holding a 3-2 lead with just over a minute left in the third period. But after pulling its goalie with two minutes remaining, Princeton (12-15-4, 10-10-2 ECAC) was able to muster a final offensive attack in which Tiger sophomore Sally Butler slipped a shot past Crimson netminder sophomore Laura Bellamy to send the game to overtime.
“This is playoff hockey,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “[Princeton is] a good team…and played inspired for their seniors.”
The third-period lapse was not the first the Crimson had on the weekend, as the team let a 3-1 lead slip away in the final frame of the first matchup with Princeton on Friday night. In that contest, the Tigers stormed back from behind, scoring two goals in the opening seven minutes of the period. But Harvard responded, scoring twice in the remaining time to earn the victory.
“We let them back into the game [on Friday],” Stone said. “Then [on Saturday] we thought we had it but had a bad break. The good news is that we…were able to figure it out and find a way to win.”
Princeton got on the board first in the opening period, with Tiger Heather Landry finding the net just over six minutes into play.
But it did not take long for Harvard to answer. Junior Jillian Dempsey, who scored a hat trick in the contest, scored all of the Crimson’s three goals in regulation, took control of the puck at the half and drilled it past Tigers’ goaltender Rachel Weber to even the game at one.
The performance earned Dempsey her second hat trick of the year and  marked Harvard’s third consecutive game in which a player notched a hat trick, with the first coming in the contest against Princeton on Feb. 4. The Crimson went on to win that match, 10-1.
The second period, like the first, saw an exchange of goals between the Ivy League opponents. Once more, the Tigers drew first blood, landing one between the pipes off the stick of Kelly Cooke, who knocked in a rebound three minutes into play.
Dempsey answered ten minutes later with her second goal of the afternoon, capitalizing on a loose puck in front of the Princeton net.
With the match tied at two, the teams went into the final period, a win-or-go-home situation for the Tigers. The teams remained knotted at two for the opening 16:34 until Dempsey notched a power-play goal to break the deadlock, giving Harvard its first lead of the contest. But Princeton had one more trick up its sleeve, mounting an offensive attack to re-tie the game with 1:04 left on the clock.
“With playoff hockey, everyone comes to play,” sophomore Marissa Gedman said. “It was a back-and-forth game the whole time. They came to play, but we did too.”
Like in the first 60 minutes of play, the momentum shifted back and forth in overtime. The sudden-death period became a battle of the goalies, with both Bellamy and Weber coming up with big stops. But with 2:01 left in first overtime frame, Harvard found what it had been looking for all game: a series-winning goal to silence the Tigers for good. Gedman fired a shot through traffic that sailed past Weber as the Princeton squad looked on in disbelief.
“The puck was just waiting for me…. It was a shot you dream about,” Gedman said. “I would say 25 percent [of the goal] was my skill, and the rest just fell into place.”
Bellamy recorded a season-high 33 saves in the win, many of them coming at crucial times in the match.
“[Bellamy] did a great job all weekend, exactly what she needed to do,” Stone said of the goalkeeper. “When things got hairy for us in front of her, she was stable, consistent.”
The win secures Harvard a spot in the ECAC semifinals, where it will compete against St. Lawrence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a sudden-death overtime win over Iona, Harvard women’s water polo wrapped up a perfect weekend at the MAAC/East Challenge in Princeton,  NJ.
The Crimson (7-2) extended its winning streak to five straight decisions, defeating Wagner (5-10), Villanova (0-11), and Iona (3-3).
Junior attacker Aisha Price spearheaded the Harvard offense with 12 goals, and freshman goalies Ariel Dukes and Jasmine Griffin headlined defensive efforts with 10 and 11 saves, respectively, for the weekend.
With junior defender Elise Molnar out with injuries, the Crimson needed a spark to get going defensively. Without Molnar’s defensive presence, the Crimson found itself in an early hole against Iona and struggled to keep Wagner at bay.
But several Crimson players stepped up with big defensive plays over the weekend. Sophomore attacker Shayna Price had 18 steals, with co-captain 2-meter Devan Kennifer adding 11.
In addition, seven Harvard players recorded multiple steals against Villanova.
“It was a total team effort,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I think we played some of the best team ball we’ve played all year.”
HARVARD 14, IONA 13
After the Crimson’s narrow one-point loss to Iona in its season opener, the Gaels tested the Crimson again, but an overtime score from Shayna Price, who is also a Crimson sports comper, gave Harvard a 14-13 overtime win to close out the squad’s 3-0 weekend.
Iona stormed out to a strong early lead, scoring six unanswered goals and looking ready to cruise to another victory.
But in the second quarter, Harvard fought back with a run of its own, scoring four goals in the frame to narrow the deficit to 6-4.
As the game progressed, the Crimson and the Gaels continued to trade blows until the game was tied at 9-9 in the final frame, forcing the game into overtime.
In the opening overtime period, Iona once again came charging out of the gates with early goals to make the score 12-10. But Harvard answered and continued to claw its way back, capitalizing on a 6-on-5 goal to cut the Gaels lead to 12-11.
With less than 30 seconds to go in the second overtime period, Kennifer came up with a game-saving play, turning a steal into a goal that leveled the score once again at 13-13, forcing a final sudden-death period.
In the frame, the two teams were held scoreless for the first few possessions until Shayna Price found the back of the net to lift the Crimson to victory and end the game.
“I’m really lucky that I got the opportunity to make the game-winning shot,” Shayna Price said. “But it’s really a team effort, and [the] 13 other goals really count more than the last one.”
The squad will test its winning streak next weekend at Blodgett Pool, when the Crimson will play host for the Harvard Invitational and face off against both conference and West Coast opponents.
HARVARD 15, VILLANOVA 1
In the third meeting between the teams this season, the Crimson once again earned a decisive victory against the Wildcats.
Fresh off a win against Wagner earlier in the day, Harvard once again produced an offensive onslaught that stifled Villanova.
Nine Crimson players scored for Harvard, and the Crimson defense managed to shut out the Wildcats in the first half, as Harvard stormed out to a 9-0 lead. The Crimson never looked back, netting six more goals in the second half to cruise to a 15-1 rout.
Seven Harvard players had multiple steals against a struggling Villanova squad, and Griffin had 11 saves in the near shutout.
The Crimson has now outscored Villanova this season in three victories, 42-5.
HARVARD 16, WAGNER 13
The Crimson started the weekend off with a bang in a win against Wagner.
Aisha Price paced Harvard with seven goals, but Wagner refused to go away without a fight, scoring at least three goals in each quarter.
The Crimson went into halftime holding a tenuous 7-6 lead. Heading into the final quarter, Harvard held a two-goal edge, 11-9.
Kennifer contributed seven steals to go along with four goals and two assists against the Seahawks, helping Harvard squeeze out the 16-13 win.
“I know everyone is working hard,” Aisha Price said. “Every step of the way, everyone’s just giving their all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since its victory on Jan. 29 against the University of Massachusetts to open the spring season, the No. 67 Harvard women’s tennis team had struggled to pull out a win.
But after three close losses in a row, the Crimson (3-3) won both of its matches at the Murr Center this weekend against Boston University and Furman.
“We just took our frustration [from losing] and turned it into energy, and we really took it out on the court,” junior co-captain Kristin Norton said. “We’ve been practicing really hard for these two matches, so we were really proud of ourselves and how we played. “
Harvard won the doubles point in both contests before taking four of the six singles matches en route to a pair of 5-2 victories.
“Every match to us, I believe, is a learning experience and a test to our training that we commit ourselves to every single week,” said junior Camille Jania, who won all four of her matches on the weekend. “We build up all these different tools and skills and endurance as we train, and we want to prove to ourselves just how good we are by playing these matches and using these tools that we’ve developed.”
HARVARD 5, FURMAN 2
The Crimson finished its second match of the weekend on Saturday on top of the Paladins (3-6), 5-2.
Jania and senior Samantha Gridley grabbed the first win of the day for Harvard, 8-3, at the No. 3 doubles position.
After the 23rd-ranked doubles duo of Norton and junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana dropped their contest, 8-4, at the No. 1 spot, the doubles point came down to the pair of sophomore Hannah Morrill and freshman Kelly Whelan.
Morrill and Whelan came through, combining for an 8-4 victory over Michele Stanford and Margaret Boyette of Furman.
In singles play, Tachibana and Norton gave the Crimson a three-point lead after quickly topping their opponents, 6-1, 6-2, and 6-0, 6-2, respectively.
The Paladins countered with wins at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots. Boyette defeated Gridley, 6-3, 7-5, while Alex Moreno-Kaste handled freshman Kelly Whelan, 6-4, 6-4.
But at the No. 2 spot, Jania beat her foe, 6-3, 7-5, to clinch the Crimson victory.
“It was a fight in the second set,” Jania said. “But I just kept on doing what I train every single day.”
Morill topped off the day at the No. 6 spot with a close, 7-5, 6-3, victory over Furman’s Susan Bitetti.
“These two matches definitely got our confidence back up again,” Norton said. “We have two wins in a row, so we just want to keep it going. Hopefully we can just continue to keep the wins rolling.”
HARVARD 5, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 2
The Crimson’s first win in four matches came over the Terriers (4-2) on Friday afternoon.
Harvard came out strong, capturing all three of the doubles matches.
Norton and Tachibana decisively beat BU’s reigning America East Player of the Week, Leonie-Charlotte Athanasiadis, and partner Jessi Linero, 8-2, at the No. 1 position.
Morrill and Whelan beat their opponent, 8-2, at the No. 2 court, while Gridley and Jania finished on the winning side of an 8-5 match that gave the Crimson a doubles sweep.
“The fitness really showed during our matches,” Norton said. “Despite not being able to look down on the court, we knew that we could outrun our opponents.”
Harvard took four of six singles matches.
Norton, who was playing at the No. 1 position for the first time, battled her foe in a 6-1, 2-6, 6-4 win.
“I think our coach is just mixing up the lineup a little bit,” Norton said. “I think on any given day, anyone can play on every level…. I’ve never played [the No. 1] position before, so I was pretty nervous, but I tried not to think about it.”
On the adjacent court, Jania beat the Terriers’ Stefanie Nunic by default after Nunic retired before the end of the first set due to injury.
After winning the second set to even the score at the No. 3 spot, Tachibana was unable to pull out a victory in a long third set, losing 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (6).
Despite sophomore Natalie Blosser dropping her contest, 6-2, 6-2, on the sixth court, Gridley and Whelan both outmatched their opponents to give Harvard the victory.
Gridley defeated her opponent, 6-3, 6-2, at the No. 4 position, while Whelan came out on top of a 3-6, 6-4, 6-5 match.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team concluded an impressive performance this weekend by capturing its 10th Ivy League title at Blodgett Pool, the third under Crimson coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski and the first at Blodgett Pool since Morawski was a senior herself in 1992.
After finishing as the runner-up to Princeton two years in a row, Harvard turned the tables this weekend and won with 1,478.5 points—168 points more than second-place Princeton.
But the meet didn’t start as the team had hoped when the Crimson got off to a shaky start on Thursday’s morning preliminary races.
“Things didn’t go as planned [on Thursday morning],” freshman swimmer Courtney Otto said. “We had people make the constellation heat when we thought they would make the finals heat. Then we had a team meeting and just talked about how we have to shake off the cobwebs and come back fighting. We just rallied behind each other every session and team meeting every day, and that kept us going.”
One of the weekend’s defining moments occurred when freshman Kelsey Hojan-Clark finished first in both the 1,000 and 1,650 free, making her the Ivy League’s fourth swimmer to ever win both events in the same year.  But according to Hojan-Clark, the individual accomplishment meant nothing outside of helping her team capture the title.
“To be honest, I swim only for my team,” Hojan-Clark said. “Swimming for myself never really factored in. The fact that we won hasn’t hit me yet, and I haven’t come to realize that we’re actually champions yet. It was a great weekend, but individually the achievements didn’t really factor in.”
Senior diver Leslie Rea made the diving record books by becoming the Ivy League’s all-time leading point getter—a title she earned after finishing second in the three-meter dive and third in the one-meter dive.
The Crimson finished day one without an individual win but still held a three-point lead in first place.
“It just showed how strong and determined our team could be,” Otto said. “The fact that we held strong even though we didn’t come up with a win in the first day was great. We knew that we had kept the ball rolling, and that kept our spirits high that we could keep it up.”
Harvard’s first championship finish came on Friday with Hojan-Clark’s 9:48.95 time in the 1,000 free, good for the sixth best time in meet history and more than four seconds better than Columbia’s second-place finisher.
Despite the victory, the Crimson still found itself trailing Princeton. That all changed with the 400 IM, in which Harvard claimed first, second, fifth, and sixth. Otto won the event with the sixth-best time in meet history (4:10.22) and her classmate Faith Martin took second with 4:20.66.
After claiming the lead, the Crimson never looked back as at least one individual finished in the top five of each remaining event for the night.  Harvard then capped off an impressive Friday with a dominant 800-free relay time of 7:15.92.  The 800-free relay team of senior Catherine Zagroba, sophomore Sara Li, Otto, and Martin finished nearly four seconds faster than the second-place Bulldogs and increased the Crimson’s lead to 92 going into the final day of the meet.
Saturday opened in familiar fashion, as Hojan-Clark again opened the day with a win, this time in the 1,650 free with a time of 16:29.90.  The win was followed by Leddy’s own first-place finish in the 200 back, posting the eighth fastest time in meet history with 1:57.26. Leddy, who also won the 200 back in 2009 and 2011, became the fourth Ivy Leaguer ever to win the event three times. Junior Laura Evans and sophomore Deirdre Clute rounded out the event with third- and fourth-place finishes, respectively, and gave Harvard a 94-point lead.
The Crimson continued to have success, again placing four in the top six—this time in the 200 fly.  Otto and Schulkin took second and third, respectively, followed by senior Hilary Roberts in fourth and freshman Ana Anaya in sixth.  The event gave the Crimson, which tallied five first-place wins in total, a 173-point lead.
“It was pretty incredible,” Otto said about the win. “We were talking about [winning the Ivy] all year. At the beginning of the year, our coach said something about how last year the team didn’t want it enough. So we kind of used that as a fire throughout the whole year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a nail-biting 5-4 win two weekends ago in New Haven to take the Ivy League crown, the spectators at the Murr Center expected a similar battle when the Harvard women’s squash team found itself pitted against Yale for the College Squash Association National Team Championships.
But the matchup between the two historic rivals on Sunday was anything but even, as the No. 1 Crimson dominated the No. 2 Bulldogs from beginning to end, taking home the team’s 13th national championship, 8-1, in front of a fiery home crowd.
Harvard (17-0, 7-0 Ivy) took control of the match early behind captain Nirasha Guruge’s decisive 3-0 victory against Yale captain Rhetta Nadas and only required six games to clinch the squad’s second Howe Cup in three years.
The Crimson won its three contests by a combined score of 26-1, sweeping Dartmouth on Friday and Trinity on Saturday, 9-0.
“All of the background stuff, all of the training showed up this weekend,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “Everyone was ready to play physically, and with no injured players, it’s a testament to what our training program is all about. So all in all, I’m a happy camper.”
HARVARD 8, YALE 1
Co-captain Cece Cortes earned Harvard’s fifth victory in commanding fashion, taking the fourth game of her match with junior Katie Bellaine, 11-1, to grab the 3-1 win.
The scene as Cortes stepped off of the court and was surrounded by her teammates was not a raucous or uncontrolled, but rather a quiet and private celebration of a team which had finally accomplished its goal.
“On paper, we have always been the team to beat, and we just had to come and meet our potential,” Cortes said.
The result was in stark comparison to the matchup for the Ancient Eight crown, in which the Crimson had to battle back from 4-2 down and sweep the last series of matches to maintain its undefeated season.
Harvard started out on the right foot with Guruge making quick work of Nadas, earning the straight-set victory on the glass court, 11-2, 11-5, 11-9.
But on the other side of the Murr  Center, Nadas’ Yale (17-2, 6-1 Ivy) teammates were making life hard for the Crimson.
Harvard freshman Megan Murray fell to freshman Issey Norman-Ross in straight sets in the No. 9 slot, and with the score tied at 1-1, junior No. 6 Natasha Kingshott was engaged in a competitive matchup.
Kingshott and Yale sophomore Gwen Tilghman battled deep into extra points, with the pair trading points back and forth. But Kingshott was able to pull away and took the second game, 19-17, to take the 2-0 lead. The junior finished out the match in a shorter third game, 11-6.
And with the Crimson in the early lead, the second round of matchups went all Harvard’s way.
Junior Laura Gemmell avenged her second collegiate loss, which she picked up two weekends ago in New Haven, downing sophomore Kim Hay, 11-9, 11-9, 15-13. Freshman Julianne Chu was also able to turn the tables on her Bulldog opponent. After dropping her previous matchup with sophomore Lilly Fast 14 days earlier, Chu took a 3-1 victory, giving the Crimson a 4-1 lead.
With Chu’s game over, Cortes found herself entering the fourth game with a 2-1 lead over Bellaine.
And with her team and the Murr  Center watching, the Crimson co-captain took control of the match, storming out to an 8-0 lead before a stroke gave Bellaine her first point of the game.
Bellaine attempted to get back into the game, but after several dives to save points proved fruitless, both Bellaine and her team realized that their journey was over.
And after the Yale junior hit the tin to give Harvard the championship, Cortes looked up into the lights with relief before turning to face her opponent and greet her team.
“I was lucky enough to be that fifth person,” Cortes said. “But we won 8-1 today, and it was really a team effort.”
With the championship wrapped up, Harvard did not take its foot of the gas.
No. 1 Amanda Sobhy continued her dominant undefeated freshman campaign, thrashing 2011 CSA Individual national champion Millie Tomlinson, 11-1, 11-3, 11-1. Classmate Haley Mendez also rounded out her freshman season with a win, defeating senior Alexandra van Arkel in straight sets.
Junior No. 7 Sarah Mumanachit joined Sobhy as the only other undefeated Crimson player on the year, sweeping freshman Shuhui Mao.
Cortes believes her team’s preparation is what made the victory so definitive.
“The past two weeks, we’ve had to work really hard and take nothing for granted,” Cortes said. “We might have taken things for granted at the beginning of the season, but I think hard work and grit were the biggest things [for our success].”
HARVARD 9, TRINITY 0
Harvard swept through No. 5 Trinity (17-4) in the Howe Cup semifinals, comfortably booking its place in the finals with a 9-0 victory that included seven straight-set victories.
Clinching the contest in the first five individual matches, the Crimson still received some quality victories from its freshman to preserve the sweep.
Murray, playing in the No. 9 spot, found herself down 2-1 and survived several match points to battle back to take the fourth game. Murray took the deciding fifth game, 11-9, to earn the victory.
Chu had to survive a surge from Bantam senior Pamela Jimenez to keep the sweep intact. Though Chu took the first two games, Jimenez won the following two to force a fifth game. But Jimenez faltered in the final game, falling to Chu, 11-8.
HARVARD 9, DARTMOUTH 0
Harvard began its quest for the Howe Cup with a perfect 9-0 win over No. 8 Dartmouth, as the Big Green failed to get a game off of the Crimson’s top nine players.
Harvard improved on its last meeting with Dartmouth (6-9, 2-5), as the Crimson dropped one match in Hanover last November. But this time, Harvard was able to achieve the perfect sweep and carry the momentum going forward in the tournament.

With less than five seconds on the clock and the Harvard men's basketball team trailing by one point, the Crimson inbounded the ball to junior forward Kyle Casey. Casey faked a pass, turned, and elevated to the net, banking in the go ahead basket to give Harvard the lead! But as the ball sailed through the net, a whistle sounded. The referee signaled an offensive foul against Casey, the basket was waved off, and Penn walked away with the win.
Like the last five seconds of Saturday's game, here are five other things that seem awesome, until you realize that they suck.
1. Sex in Widener Stacks: First, it's exciting. Then you're naked on the floor of the Ukrainian literature section and someone's calling HUPD.
2. First snowfall: so pretty. February: so cold, so wet, so ugly.
3. Chatroulette: "I came, I saw, I cleared my browser history."
4. High heels: You check out your hot self in the mirror…and then you take a step.
5. Comping the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine: "It's awesome since the room is cool and the jokes are funny. Then after five minutes the jokes are old and the comp sucks," said a Lampoon business comper who wished to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions.

While Harvard graduates include Nobel Prize winners, celebrities, and Wall Street moguls, the University admits future criminals, too. Flyby reports on the most infamous crimes that have taken place on Harvard's campus in the past few decades.
Stealing $120,000 From Kids with Cancer
Boston kids with cancer were supposed to receive $120,000 of support from Harvard students, but Charles K. Lee '93 stole this substantial donation before it ever reached charity. An Eliot House senior, Lee was one of the co-chairs of "An Evening with Champions," an Eliot House-organized ice skating show that benefits children's cancer research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. While serving as co-chair, Lee wrote 83 separate checks to himself, ranging in value from $50  to $7,862, for a total of $119,881.26 stolen. According to one friend, "[Lee] wanted to epitomize Eliot House" through showcasing conspicuous and lavish spending and developing an old money image for himself.
Lee's crime was discovered after his 1993 graduation and he plead guilty in court in Feb. 1995. His sentence amounted to a single year in jail, 10 years of probation, and 100 hours of community service each year until he repaid all of the stolen money. Harvard did not annul his diploma.
A Murder in Dunster
On May 28, 1995, Sinedu Tadesse '96 woke up and attacked her roommate Trang Phoung Ho '96 while Ho was still lying in bed. Tadesse stabbed Ho 45 times with a hunting knife, stabbed Ho's friend Thao Nguyen who was visiting for the weekend, and then hung herself from the shower curtain pole in their bathroom in Dunster H-21. Nguyen, a 26-year-old resident of Lowell, Mass., survived the incident, while Ho and Tadeese, both juniors at the College, died.
Shortly after the incident, Tadesse Zelleke, Tadesse's father, told The Crimson that Tadesse considered Ho her best friend. Soon after the murder, it was speculated on campus that Tadesse assaulted Ho after Ho asked not to room with her again the next fall. After the tragic event, the college established a new financial aid scholarship, the Trang Ho Public Service Fellowship, in Ho's memory.
A TV, Some DVDs, and a Crazy Party
Imagine having $100,000 to spend on your friend's birthday party. That's the budget that Randy J. Gomes '02 had at his fingertips when he planned a birthday bash for his close friend Suzanne M. Pomey '02—needless to say, the party was open bar. Gomes and Pomey embezzled $100,000 from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals when they both had access to the Pudding's bank account their senior year. Authorities think that they used this money to purchase a flatscreen TV, a DJ machine, close to 100 DVDs, drugs, and clothes, among many other expensive items.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to dismiss Pomey and Gomes after the incident, a very rare and severe punishment at Harvard. After being denied their degrees they pleaded guilty and escaped with marks on their criminal records but no jail time—only five years of probation for Gomes and two for Pomey.

Women's Week traditionally celebrates women's accomplishments and stimulates conversation around the role of women today and the larger implications of gender at Harvard. The students behind the event are already generating conversation, starting with just a whisper.
The "Whisper Campaign" was the brainchild of the Women's Cabinet, a collaboration of different women's groups on campus. The campaign represents a unique form of publicity that is described by its organizers in equally unique terms.
"There are three major segments to it: babies, teens, and mamas," said Nur N. Ibrahim '13, an intern at the Harvard College Women's Center as well as a Crimson photographer.
Harvard students have already seen segment one: the "babies." The Wonder Woman posters displayed around campus were recently revealed to be this year's Women's Week logo.
This week, the publicity campaign has entered its "teen" years, and students will see posters with more information.
"The idea behind it was just to convey the sense of progressing from giving hints to dropping more information…and this progressed to a more open way of expressing what exactly is going on," Ibrahim said.
The Whisper Campaign is new this year and has already garnered attention.
The organizers of Women's Week 2012 are hopeful that this "whisper" will grow into something much louder.
"I think people are going to be curious about this because they've seen the symbols everywhere," Ibrahim said. "I feel like this is definitely more effective than a regular email."
Women's Week 2012 is co-sponsored by the Harvard College Women's Center and The Seneca, Inc., with support from the Women's Cabinet, and will take place from March 4-9.
