After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I know that as you read this, many of you are with your families or are on your way towards your home communities. I also know that some of you may find yourselves still here on campus, unable to travel at this time. My message to each of you is a message of hope in the face of uncertainty; a message of relief in the face of trials; and a message of the presence of ease after hardship.
The only thing constant in this world is change. Change tends to be qualitative — being from better to worse, or from worse to better. As human beings, we are constantly marked by change. Indeed, leadership is often forged from the crucible of change. We learn the meaning of being human only through our persevering and making meaning out of change. On some occasions, change delivers benevolence from the winds of destiny. Other times change ushers in deprivation which reminds us of our essential needs from each other and of our need for something greater than each other.
As equal members of the human community, we grow and develop through both qualities of change. It is easy to welcome the kind of change whose quality delivers upliftment and joy. But how do we process the kind of change that deprives us of some of the things we cherish dearly but often take for granted? Rumi, the famous 13th-century Anatolian poet and jurist who himself endured this quality of change when he became a refugee as a child, used to have quite a bit to say about change. In articulating the mysterious but nevertheless providential aspect of change Rumi would say:
“If you are irritated by every rub, how will your mirror be polished?”
In moments when we are swiftly blown away by the whirlwind of change, the hustle and bustle can naturally be disorienting for any of us. But as people who are more than just material beings, even if we find our bodies drifting, undergoing novel journeys that de-anchor us from the world as we knew it, what often helps is to imbed deeper yet transcendental meanings in our hearts and minds which may help us navigate such unchartered territories.
First, any tribulation you find yourself in, know that it could be worse! The fact that it isn’t worse is in itself a matter that requires a moment of thankfulness. Keep your eye (meaning the internal one) on the blessings that remain constant throughout the change. After all, which of those blessings could you possibly deny? Remembering what you have while in the midst of loss is part of undergoing the kind of character polishing that makes us diamonds, priceless to each other. Support one another and check on each other. Being socially distant does not have to translate into being socially isolated. We can find new, creative ways to stay connected and to reach out in times like this.
Second, remember that the grander narrative of the human being is one of migration and travel. We are, in this world, but travelers. That being the case, we must always remember that our time in all places is finite. While there is comfort in being in our homes, we must also call to the forefront of our minds what we will leave behind. We all arrive and leave places, so much so that it never really occurs to us. What distinguishes leaders in history/herstory is how they gave new meaning to present conditions which also fashioned the future. The time we have in all the places we inhabit is limited. Staying positive and consequently positively affecting the people and environment in our midst helps transform the world into a better place to inhabit both today and tomorrow. Therefore, when you travel, not only should you guard yourself from the contagious virus that infects others through human contact, but equally important is to instead infect others with the righteous content of your character. Make positive, lasting impressions on the people and the places you pass through so that both become tremendously impacted by the beauty of having encountered you!
Finally, choose courage in the face of fear and uncertainty. Remember that there are also positive contagions out there. Courage is contagious. Courage involves mustering the internal strength and conviction to face the horizons of an uncertain future, knowing that whatever the case, the future will be brighter than the past. We can become courageous ourselves by remembering courageous figures of the past — our remarkable, pious predecessors. Now is the time to remember that there were tougher obstacles faced by our parents, our grandparents, many of our relatives, and countless other heroes who stared down trauma, loss, oppression, war, and many other hidden and apparent threats. If they had courage, so can we; if they found hopes and dreams, so can we; if they never gave up, neither must we; if they became precious to us, then so too can we become precious to others. Courage enables us to think and operate with a profound sense of obligation to current and later generations.
Therefore, let us go forward together and face the remainder of our semester with courage, counting the blessings we have and cultivating a renewed sense of gratitude. Let us also remain devoted to a common cause of making the places and people we encounter a little bit better, on account of our character, no matter where we migrate to and no matter for how long or short of a duration we may inhabit that given place. And let us stay connected in new creative ways so that we revere the bonds we have forged.
May peace and blessings be with all of you and your families!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we collectively reel from the devastating impact of coronavirus — an impact made far worse by the Trump administration’s inept response — I figured now would be a great time to revisit another of this administration’s forgotten blunders.
On December 20, 2019, the Trump administration inaugurated the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, with the mission to organize, train, and equip space forces “in order to protect U.S. and allied interests in space.” However, this was no giant leap for mankind. All the administration did was rename the Air Force Space Command (which has existed since 1982) the “United States Space Force,” and designate this new group as its own, independent branch of the military.
Trump’s decision to create the Space Force was met by most people with lighthearted derision. Folks on Twitter lampooned the decision to use Earth-tone camouflage for the official Space Force uniform, as well as the similarities between the Space Force’s logo and the insignia of Star Trek’s Starfleet Command. Steve Carell is even working on a comedic “Space Force” series for Netflix.
But, for all the fun we can have at the Space Force’s expense, it’s important to recognize that its creation was a truly bad idea, for a number of reasons.
First, it’s redundant. As I explained, the Air Force Space Command already existed as a military group responsible for protecting U.S. interests in space. Why do we need a completely new branch to serve this purpose? The answer is that we don’t, especially not at this time, when the threat to our space interests (namely, our satellites) is negligible. The creation of the Space Force will only lead to more bureaucracy within the military and a high financial burden that will likely be shifted onto the taxpayers.
If we do care about our extraterrestrial interests, it might sound like a good idea to create a branch with an exclusive focus on space. But, in reality, this will simply lead to less cohesion among the military. The branches of the Armed Forces are notoriously competitive; this has been especially true when it comes to outer space. When the “space race” with the Soviet Union first began, the Army and the Navy competed — rather than collaborated — to achieve space feats, such as being the first to launch an American satellite into orbit.
It was later decided that NASA would be in charge of all civilian projects in space, while the Air Force would handle military operations in that realm. It’s highly unlikely that the Air Force is ready to step back and relinquish control over space operations to the newly-formed Space Force. Besides, where does “Air” end and “Space” begin? With scientists unable to agree on a satisfactory answer to this question, military officials from each branch will certainly use the ambiguity to compete for the greatest jurisdiction possible.
Finally, the creation of the Space Force sets a dangerous precedent — that space should be thought of as a military zone to be “dominated.” We saw this concept begin to play out during the Cold War — but, luckily, a series of treaties were able to restrict the militarization of space. This included the broadly-supported Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which (among other things) prevented nuclear weapons from ever being sent into orbit.
A return to the era of the militarization of space is a bad idea. As some scientists have warned, the creation of the Space Force could inspire other countries “to focus on the development of space weaponry.” And space weaponry — even the non-nuclear kind — can be highly deadly. Take, for example, a kinetic bombardment system like the Air Force’s Project Thor; this hypothetical weapon system, also called “Rods from the Gods,” would drop massive tungsten rods on Earth targets, creating an impact on par with a nuclear weapon.
And even a small-scale battle in orbit could have devastating effects. Scientists warn of the “Kessler syndrome,” a possible scenario in which a chain reaction of colliding space debris creates a cloud of tiny junk flying around the Earth. This would likely destroy our satellites, as well as our chances to send anything else into space for decades.
But, alas, the Space Force has been created — an action that will be very difficult for any future president to reverse. And I suppose it was only a matter of time before we’d have a branch of the military dedicated to space, since space is becoming a bigger priority as the century progresses. It was an unfortunate inevitability that world governments would begin to see outer space as a domain of warfare akin to land, sea, and air.
So, if the Space Force is here to stay, I (naively) hope that it will serve one purpose, and one purpose only: preserving peace in outer space. And I’m not referring to the American vision of “peace” that means “peace over here through war over there,” but a genuine peace for all parties involved. Because, if space does become the next realm of warfare, then we’re all equally screwed.

Researchers at the Broad Institute are improving and validating a COVID-19 detection protocol that could potentially take less than an hour and cost around ten dollars per test.
The development on the so-called “SHERLOCK” protocol — short for Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter Unlocking — comes as the Broad Institute announced it would put its “high-throughput genomic capabilities at the disposal of the Commonwealth to enable increased capacity for COVID-19 diagnostic testing” in a press release Tuesday.
The protocol uses Cas13, an RNA targeting enzyme, to detect viral RNA sequences in extracted nucleic acid samples. Omar O. Abudayyeh, a researcher at the Broad Institute and a co-author of the protocol, said the enzyme “can detect single molecules and nucleic acid” with “high specificity.”
“It’s sensitive to even just single mismatches between the target you want and something else, which is great for if you’re genotyping a person and want to know if they have a particular mutation for a disease, or if you’re trying to distinguish two viruses that are really similar, like COVID-19 and other SARS-type viruses,” Abudayyeh said.
The protocol, if validated through testing and approved by the federal government, could offer significant improvements to existing COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
Broad Institute researcher Jonathan S. Gootenberg, a co-author of the protocol, said current tests have high costs and other requirements that could be reduced by his team’s approach.
“We would ballpark that the test could be faster, especially if it had other advantages like needing less instrumentation,” Gootenberg said. “Similar for cost, we can ballpark what the tests would be in production, because there are certain factors that can make the price of the test go down in mass production, but also labor and other manufacturing processes.”
“We ballpark that our tests could be potentially around ten dollars per test,” he added.
Abudayyeh said the team aimed to make SHERLOCK “simple to operate” compared to existing tests.
Recommendations against in-laboratory research to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have forced changes in the group’s workstyle. The researchers are improving their detection protocol in ways that minimize in-person interaction.
“Computational biologists – they’re working remotely – and other lab members are also working remotely, maybe doing literature or discussing concepts and not actually doing experiments,” Gootenberg said. “For those of us who still have to come into lab, we’re using our best reasonable measures, where we try to avoid public transportation, Ubers, anything that might have the capacity to be a factor.”
“While we’re together in spaces, we don’t have meetings in person, and in lab, we try to maintain distances between each other,” he added, acknowledging that these changes have made day-to-day operations “a little more difficult.”
Though the protocol has not been fully validated and approved for circulation, Gootenberg said the team is hopeful for successful results in the near future.
“When we first published the protocol, it was met with a significant amount of enthusiasm, and the protocol has been distributed to various groups dealing with clinical samples who have shown initial promising results,” Gootenberg said. “We’re in the process of really improving the test and trying to make something that can help this currently unmet need for testing.”

Harvard students and others circulated an online petition this week calling on University administrators to offer campus facilities as housing for Cambridge’s homeless population during the global coronavirus outbreak.
“We have the facilities, the resources, and the organizational wherewithal to implement an emergency shelter on campus,” the petition reads. “It is simply unthinkable not to do this and let our most vulnerable community members suffer and die on the doorsteps of the richest university in the world.”
The petition follows University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s March 10 announcement that students would have to vacate their on-campus housing to help curb the spread of the virus. As of Sunday night, more than 750 Harvard affiliates, Cambridge residents, and others had signed the petition.
Harvard Divinity School student Christopher J. Diak published the petition after reading a Boston Globe article detailing the difficulties municipal governments faced in containing the spread of coronavirus among the region’s homeless population.
“That weekend, as the undergraduates left campus, it occurred to me that there will be thousands of vacant dorm rooms on campus that could be converted into a homeless shelter, at the very least for the residents of Cambridge,” Diak wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Several Cambridge homeless shelters, such as the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y youth homeless shelter, have fought to remain open and operational in the face of the mounting crisis. HSHS, however, closed for the season Sunday morning, according to the organization’s website.
Diak also sent a letter to Bacow with the same proposal, according to the petition. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that Bacow received the letter.
The petition references a policy order City Councilor Marc C. McGovern submitted to the City Council last Monday, which called for a “comprehensive” strategy for supporting the city’s homeless population. The proposal suggested “opening space for Cambridge’s homeless” in local colleges and hotels as a possible option.
McGovern said in a Sunday interview that, though no “centralized” plans had been made, the city will discuss options for supporting homeless residents this week. He added that the University “deserves some recognition” for its ongoing cooperation with the city.
“I know that Harvard is doing a lot with the city,” McGovern said. “But this is one that we haven’t been able to solve yet, and so I think it’s all hands on deck. We should be exploring all options.”
Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the University is involved in “active conversations” with state and municipal governments about providing support during the pandemic. He also wrote that the University is currently housing hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students on campus and is following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on social distancing.
“The University is already working to support our neighbors in multiple ways, including through learning materials for local children, engaging members of our community who have expertise that can contribute to planning efforts by cities and states, and the provision of available personal protective equipment at the University to state emergency management authorities,” he wrote.
Cambridge resident Skip Schiel said “empathy” drove him to add his name to the petition and said he thought using Harvard’s dormitories would make “a heck of a lot of sense.”
“The usual problems of unsheltered people are tremendously exacerbated by the current virus crisis,” he said. “Many could die without at least minimal shelter.”
Diak wrote in his email that he believed a concerted effort between Cambridge and Harvard would be necessary to effectively respond to the crisis.
“This is a rapidly evolving emergency and life may change even more dramatically than we now anticipate, so, coordination between the City and the University will be crucial to our rising to the occasion,” he explained. “Furthermore, we need to understand that life will not go on as usual this semester and act accordingly, clearly and decisively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President James A. Mathew ’21 and Vice President Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 advocated for a “Double A” grading model due to impacts stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak in an email to students Sunday.
In the email, Mathew and White-Thorpe wrote that after discussions with students as well as faculty and staff, they concluded that the Double A grading model was the “most equitable academic solution.” Under the model, professors would give all students grades of either A or A-minus at their discretion.
Mathew and White-Thorpe added that they believe a universal pass-fail system would also be “reasonable.” Under such a model — which has already been implemented at Columbia and MIT — all courses would be graded in a pass-fail system.
Still, the pair wrote that they prefer the Double A model because some students rely on letter grades for scholarship eligibility and graduate school applications.
“While we believe that universal pass-fail is reasonable, we strongly believe that the double A model is the most beneficial solution given the extenuating circumstances,” Mathew and White-Thorpe wrote in the email.
Council secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 also sent an email later Sunday evening asking for input from undergraduates about grading policy changes.
Brennan included an optional form titled “Harvard College Grading Policy - UC Feedback.” The form asks students to rank three grading models — “Universal Pass/Fail,” “Opt-in Pass/Fail,” and “Double A” — as their first, second, or third choice.
Under an opt-in pass-fail model, students would decide whether to take each of their courses for a letter grade. Critics of the model — including Mathew and White-Thorpe — say it can put students that are experiencing hardships caused by the COVID-19 outbreak at a disadvantage.
The form also provides students with an opportunity to explain their preferences and suggest alternative grading policies. It asks undergraduates to put their concentration and yard/house affiliation but gives them the option to remain anonymous.
Brennan wrote in an email to The Crimson that Mathew and White-Thorpe’s email demonstrates their desire to have the College implement a grading model that best fits the needs of all students.
“I think that James and Ify’s advocacy for an alternative grading model reflects an appropriate response to an unprecedented degree of constraint placed upon members of the student body,” Brennan wrote. “The consequences of recent actions taken in response to COVID-19 at Harvard and on campuses around the world necessitate flexibility in order to ensure a level playing field for students throughout the remainder of the semester, especially for students who will now be completing their coursework in conditions that are suboptimal for academic performance.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke announced March 12 that the College has reopened the deadline to drop courses and change grading status from letter-graded to pass-fail through April 13. On Friday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J.Claybaugh said administrators are “reviewing other policies to see whether they should be adjusted as well.”
Lowell House UC representative M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21 wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Council is also assessing grading policy models, including Double A, that would assist students as they attend online classes off-campus.
“No student should be penalized academically by the COVID-19 crisis,” Larson wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before sunrise on Friday morning, teaching fellow Max G. Ehrenfreund said he expects to log onto Zoom at 6 a.m. Pacific Time from the dining room table of his aunt and uncle’s home in Portland, Ore. to lead a discussion section for History of Science 176: “Brainwashing and Modern Techniques of Mind Control.”
As Harvard affiliates are set to resume their courses this week amid the global coronavirus crisis, course instructors like Ehrenfreund have devoted time to preparing for the move to virtual classes — the majority of which will take place on the online teleconference platform Zoom.
Some teaching fellows said the transition to remote learning will transform the structure of their course and their style of teaching; others said their class will function more or less as usual. No matter how stark the change, many teaching staff said in interviews that they expect the first week to feature unforeseen digital glitches.
And, as course instructors and students face a global health crisis, several said that they waffle over whether academic obligations should be first on anyone’s priority list.
Since Harvard announced courses would move online, many of the College’s flagship courses rapidly shifted to digital formats.
Humanities 10: “A Humanities Colloquium” will share recorded lectures on Canvas while hosting discussion sections and writing labs on Zoom, according to Anthony A. Derveniadis-Hernández, a teaching fellow in the course.
Derveniadis-Hernández said he believes the course will transition seamlessly in the coming weeks.
“I think what helps with being a literature course is that we can still talk about whatever text and still engage with one another,” he said. “I feel like it’s gonna be a breeze. I think it will just be helpful for everyone to see each other and just be in class.”
He also said he believes the assigned course readings will provide students with a respite from the global pandemic.
“It will give them other ideas to think about, other things to write about and keep their mind away from what is going on in the present,” he said. “Hum10 is going to be a positive outlet for many of the students in the class.”
Economics professor David I. Laibson, who is one of the course heads for Economics 10B: “Principles of Economics (Macroeconomics),” said his course will continue lecture and discussion sections in real time over Zoom. Laibson also said he believes the course will handle the transition well in large part because the course’s teaching staff are already familiar with digital tools.
“We were using a lot of technology to augment our teaching,” Laibson said. “The fact that we’re going to do that even more intensively I think is less of a shock to our system, because we were already largely there.”
Certain large sciences classes, by contrast, are eliminating elements of their curricula that formerly required in-person meetings.
Section meetings will now be optional in Physical Sciences 11: “Foundations and Frontiers of Modern Chemistry” and discontinued altogether in Life Sciences 1B: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences,” according to teaching fellows in each course.
In both courses, students will write lab reports based on taped demonstrations rather than in-person lab work.
PS11 teaching fellow Samuel S. Veroneau said he believes Harvard has provided guidance to teaching fellows to help them transition their teaching online, though he also noted that the support came during a time of instability for graduate students as well.
“We also were told that we have to leave. So I think as we were kind of packing up, getting multiple emails a day about practicing Zoom was just a little bit — it just added to the level of hecticness about all of it,” he said. “A minute to decompress would be nice.”
Some courses have even moved their exams to Zoom, a video conferencing platform that will become as commonplace to Harvard affiliates as lecture halls in Sever or the Science Center.
Over spring break, Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation” held a closed-book midterm proctored via Zoom, according to teaching fellow Pablo E. Balan. Students focused the camera on themselves during the exam and then uploaded a picture of their written answers.
“This exam in particular was closed-book, so they were supposed to show their work environment, but not what they were writing exactly on paper,” Balan said.
Other teaching staff said they have faced challenges recreating their course online.
Kelsey A. Viscount, a teaching fellow for the graduate student course Harvard Divinity School 2006: “Ethnographic Methods in the Study of Religion,” said she and her teaching instructor decided they would teach the course asynchronously because they worried about the challenges students might face learning off-campus.
“For students who do have time and want to really still get the most out of the class that’s the way we decided to do it without it being such a hindrance to folks who do have a number of other needs right now,” she said. “You have to teach to the students in the room.”
Viscount said the course will ask students to complete a series of tasks each week on Canvas, including watching films and writing and responding to discussion posts. She also said course staff asked students to suspend their final projects conducting in-person research on religious groups due to social-distancing guidelines.
Viscount said she does not believe teaching staff should try to replicate their in-person courses online.
“If classes aren’t designed to be online from the beginning, then this idea that we can seamlessly migrate classes as they’re currently designed onto a digital format to me is very short-sighted,” she said.
Economics professor Christopher L. Foote said he felt the topics he teaches toward the end of his course Economics 1010B: “Intermediate Macroeconomics” are better suited to a physical blackboard than to Zoom, so he will instead post lecture videos from the previous year’s iteration of the course.
“I sort of walk around among the blackboards in Science Center B in a way that I think helps students kind of get what’s going on,” Foote said. “And although there is a way — and many, obviously, many Harvard professors are going to be sort of replicating blackboard instruction via Zoom — it’s not the same.”
The transition to online learning will also present obstacles for foreign language classes, according to Hans M. Pech, who teaches German 10AB: “Beginning German (Intensive).”
Foreign language courses typically rely on interactive teaching through props, breakout group work, and body language, Pech said.
“If you have one hour 15 minutes, and you can’t do all these interactive activities, which make the class actually quite fun, then that might feel like a drag,” he said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the Office of Undergraduate Education, Harvard University Information Technology, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning have all provided resources and workshops on teaching virtually to faculty and teaching staff.
“The College is confident that courses can be adapted so that meaningful learning can continue,” Dane wrote. “It should also be noted, that very good things are being said from colleagues at schools that started remote teaching last week, and that makes us all the more hopeful.”
“Last week, OUE hosted nearly a dozen workshop sessions on nuts-and-bolts topics, which more than 300 people attended, and going forward the Bok Center will be offering one-on-one consultation,” Dane added.
Many teaching instructors said they have devoted time to familiarize themselves with Zoom. Still, they said they anticipate a week of technological stumbles and shaky pedagogical experiments.
Despite preparing for the transition, Laibson said he expects “unforeseen bugs.”
“I’ve done a lot of work trying to reproduce what it will be like, but I can imagine that when all of a sudden for the first time there’s 500 people simultaneously on Zoom, something doesn’t operate the way I thought it would,” he said.
Two Ec 10B teaching fellows said they felt similarly.
“I can imagine a scenario where I go into class or I set up my online class, and it’s just not working,” teaching fellow David H. Brown said. “You can’t get the Zoom to work or we can’t get people logged in.”
“I’m sure that in the beginning, they’ll be more upfront costs in sort of like figuring out, you know, how we want to teach, you know, what works, what doesn’t work,” said Ivan Z. Stoitzev, another Ec 10B teaching fellow.
Ehrenfreund said he believes this week will feature trial and error as both teaching fellows and undergraduate students alike adjust to academic life on Zoom.
“The challenges aren’t just with the technology, it’s also in thinking differently about how you teach,” he said. “It’s gonna be a mess, and I don’t think we’re going to know how much of a mess it is until next week. We’re definitely going to do our best, because that’s what the students are owed.”
Linguistics 190: “Quantitative Methods in Linguistics” teaching fellow Ethan G. Wilcox said he worries the online platform will erode the personal connections he has made with his students.
“One of the — this sounds corny but — the joys of teaching for me is that I get to know my students. I get to meet all these really exciting and excited people,” he said. “I’m kind of worried that it will be a little less personal.”
“It’d be a shame if we were unable to have those ancillary learning opportunities from each other that teaching affords because we’re like, not in the same room,” Wilcox added.
Even if Zoom works smoothly, Laibson said he empathizes with students who cannot devote attention to his course amid the coronavirus chaos.
“The idea that everyone’s gonna be able to focus on Ec 10B when thousands — probably millions — of people are dying around the globe, you know, that’s a big question,” he said. “And I completely understand the student who says ‘I just can’t do this. There’s too much sorrow and there’s too much distress in our world, and I can’t focus on studying at this moment.’”
“I’ll say, ‘I get it,’” Laibson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is better prepared for a potential economic downturn due to the coronavirus outbreak than it was for the 2008 recession, according to Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister.
“We’ve done a lot of recession-based scenario planning, and the University is in a much better position than we were following the 2008 financial crisis with respect to liquidity and the capacity to withstand stress,” Hollister said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
In the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, the total value of the endowment declined by almost 30 percent. In 2008, before the crisis, the endowment was valued at $37 billion. After the economic crash, it came out at just $26 billion, on par with its 2005 level.
At the time of the financial crisis, the endowment aimed for a minus 5 percent cash allocation, leaving the University so strapped for cash it was forced to issue around $2.5 billion in bonds over the 2009 fiscal year, increasing its total debt to over $6 billion.
It took the endowment another six years — until 2015 — to bounce back to its pre-recession total. As of 2019, Harvard’s endowment was valued at $40.9 billion dollars, 2 percent of which was allocated to cash.
Timothy J. Keating ’85, the president of Keating Wealth Management, wrote in an emailed statement that how a recession will impact Harvard depends on whether such changes will provide it with a “sufficient buffer.”
“The actual impact will be a function of Harvard’s allocation to cash, and whether there is sufficient buffer to absorb the shocks,” Keating wrote. “The low/zero/negative allocation to cash is what cooked Harvard and Yale’s endowment gooses in 2008-2009.”
Darrell Duffie, a professor at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, agreed that the University’s ability to weather a recession comes down to its cash holdings.
“The Harvard endowment last time didn’t have enough cash in the last financial crisis,” he said. “Whether it set aside enough cash this time, I personally don’t know.”
Hollister credited N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the CEO of Harvard Management Company, with making the endowment “comparatively liquid” to its status in the 2008 recession.
“In addition, the University itself, which provides working capital to the operating activities across campus, is in a healthy and liquid position,” Hollister said. “This means that the University is positioned to withstand an interruption in normal operations, an economic downturn, and other stress scenarios.”
Each year, a five percent payout of the endowment covers 35 percent of the University’s annual operating expenses.
But the percentage of each of Harvard’s 12 schools' budgets that comes from the endowment varies. In fiscal year 2019, it ranged from 87 percent at the Radcliffe Institute to 18 percent at the Business School and School of Public Health. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences received the third-most, at 50 percent.
Duffie said the impact of coronavirus on the school’s endowment is not a question of whether it will be bad, but of “how bad.”
“Unless Harvard’s endowment has been set up to hedge against just this sort of macroeconomic shock, one would guess that it’s a question of just how bad it is,” Duffie said.
Hollister said in the interview that the University began preparing for a potential recession “about 18 months ago.” University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who is an economist, championed such preparations early in his tenure.
Recession planning is part of a University’s general financial management, according to Keating.
“Harvard’s time horizon is perpetual, and recessions (which are regular occurrences) are fully baked into the overall investment planning,” Keating wrote.
At Harvard, preparing for a potential recession occurs via scenario planning at each school, since deans have authority over their school’s resources.
“Under the direction of their deans, each of Harvard’s Schools as part of the annual multi-year financial planning process, as well as the annual budgeting process, examined how an economic downturn could impact their operations, and they began to scenario plan different responses,” Hollister said. “We wanted to be prepared in the event that our revenues were diminished in order to try to concentrate our resources on the vital core mission of teaching and research.”
Representatives of Harvard’s 12 schools did not provide The Crimson with information about existing recession plans.
Jane Huber, a spokesperson for the Radcliffe Institute, wrote in an emailed statement that it is “too early” to comment on their financial response to the outbreak.
“At the moment, Radcliffe’s primary focus is on the safety and well being of our community,” Huber said. “The pandemic is in its early stages and any longer term financial impact on the Institute is not yet calculable.”
Despite the plans in place, Thomas Parker — a senior fellow at the Institute for Higher Education Policy — wrote in an emailed statement that cuts will be difficult.
“No one will like it. Overnight, every expense center will be convinced that it is the one expense center which is absolutely necessary to the University’s survival,” he wrote. “The administration will have to sort through competing claims and make unpopular decisions. That’s its job.”
The hit to the endowment in 2009 resulted in tangible changes across Harvard, including significant cuts to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ budget, a delay in the campus expansion project in Allston, and the demise of hot breakfast at upperclassmen houses.
Hollister acknowledged that, despite advance planning, a recession will be hard for University affiliates.
“These efforts put us in a good position, and give us the ability to focus on aligning our resources behind our academic mission, but they will not eliminate adversity or difficulty in the event of a recession,” Hollister told the Gazette. “Given what is happening, we expect to see a decline in revenues due to, for example, increased financial aid needs, a slowdown in philanthropy, and a lower distribution from the endowment, and we will need to adjust our spending accordingly.”
Hollister also referenced a few areas of the University’s budget where cuts are already being considered.
“We are already examining and reducing all discretionary, nonessential spending,” Hollister said. “There are other places where we can look to reduce costs, beginning with slowing the pace of capital projects, limiting the use of consultants and third parties, and renegotiating contract costs and terms with outside suppliers.”
“We don’t know what the depth and duration of this downturn will look like or how it will rebound, and so it’s wise for us to plan and prepare for the worst. This downturn could be more severe than 2008,” he added.
Hollister noted that the University has an obligation to uphold its mission amid any economic crisis.
“Harvard is relatively well resourced compared to many other universities, but contrary to popular perception, Harvard does not have unlimited wealth,” Hollister said. “It’s true that our endowment is large on an absolute basis, but it is committed to supporting existing vital academic programs and campus activities. In short: Every penny of the annual distribution from the endowment is subscribed and utilized in support of our mission.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allowing Harvard hopefuls some reprieve as the world grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic, several of the University’s graduate schools have adjusted their admissions programming and application processes following the shutdown of many campus operations.
The University’s schools have postponed or canceled most in-person admissions events scheduled for this spring, as Harvard has strongly discouraged non-essential gatherings of 25 people or more and discontinued campus tours. Meanwhile, sittings for various graduate school admissions examinations — including the GMAT, GRE, LSAT, and MCAT — have been postponed or canceled worldwide due to COVID-19 concerns.
The Educational Testing Service has postponed its administration of the GRE — a graduate school entrance exam required by many Harvard master’s and Ph.D. programs — in some locations worldwide. ETS announced that students in many countries, including the United States, will be able to take an at-home version of the GRE General Test with a live, remote proctor starting March 23.
The Graduate Management Admission Council has largely suspended testing for the GMAT, another graduate school entrance exam, across the United States and the globe. The GMAC will put enhanced health and safety measures in place for testing centers that remain open, according to the group’s website.
Administrators from several departments within Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences said the pandemic has yet to have major impacts on their admissions processes, which mostly take place in the fall.
History Director of Graduate Studies Sidney Chalhoub wrote in an email that his department has not made any changes but may need to drop GRE scores from part of admissions requirements.
“We can probably manage without them,” Chalhoub wrote.
Chalhoub added that the pandemic has affected this year’s admitted students, who will not be able to attend the department’s in-person recruitment events before deciding where to attend.
Mathematics Director of Graduate Studies Mark Kisin wrote in an email that it remains “too early to know” whether next year’s admissions will be affected.
“Our next round of admissions is nine months away,” Kisin wrote.
The Economics department likewise has not had any “deep discussion” about future changes to admissions, according to Director of Graduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron — though one factor he has considered is the impact of a potential recession on departmental admissions numbers.
“If the stock market goes down further or stays down, then the number of graduate student slots that universities broadly are going to be able to afford might well decline,” Miron said. “That could have a big implication for not exactly how admissions is done, but for how many students we admit.”
Applicants to the Medical School will also face changes to their admissions testing. The Association of American Medical Colleges has canceled its March 27 and April 4 sittings of the MCAT worldwide, according to its website. Students whose tests have been canceled may request a full refund or reschedule for a later April or May test date for no fee.
Similarly, the Law School Admission Council, which administers the LSAT, has cancelled all March sessions for the test globally, according to an update posted to the body’s website. American and Canadian registrants were automatically signed up for the April 25 testing date, while registrants from other countries are being transferred to tests on June 27 or 28.
LSAC is “aggressively exploring” alternatives for examination administration, including remote-proctored tests and additional test dates, its announcement states.
Harvard Law School, meanwhile, announced Wednesday that it would extend the deadline for its Junior Deferral Program from May 1 to July 1.
The Junior Deferral Program allows college juniors to apply to the Law School and receive an admissions decision while still in college. Students who are admitted and choose to enroll in the program commit to working at least two years professionally before matriculating.
The Law School’s announcement came the same day that Harvard Business School announced it would extend the deadline to apply to its “2+2” deferred admissions program, from Apr. 2 to June 1.
Associate Director of J.D. Admissions Nefyn Meissner wrote in a message posted to the Law School’s website that the school made the decision to accommodate sudden changes the COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon undergraduates. At Harvard, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana instructed students to vacate campus with five days’ notice earlier this month as the University shifts its courses entirely online for the rest of the semester.
“We realize that many of our applicants are moving out of your dorms, transitioning to online courses, searching for summer opportunities, and having your test dates cancelled or postponed,” he wrote. “We hope that this adjusted deadline allows you more time to adjust, prepare, and complete your applications.”
“We are here for y’all,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One early morning during Seth Towns’ sophomore year, a “No Caller ID” phone call awoke the Winthrop House resident. Picking up the out-of-the-blue call, Towns recognized a familiar voice on the other end, one that he had heard numerous times in interviews.
“Hello, is this Seth?”
Turns out, it was best-selling author Mitch Albom who had made the spontaneous phone call to the Harvard Basketball star.
“I lost my mind,” Towns recalled. “We talked on the phone for maybe an hour, and he invited me over the summer to volunteer at his orphanage [in Haiti], which I jumped at the opportunity.”
Two days prior, Towns had casually discussed in the coaches office that he was an avid reader of the renown sports journalist-turned-inspirational storyteller. Having finished around five of Albom’s works that have topped The New York Times bestseller list, the sociology concentrator was particularly interested in the author’s philanthropy work.
Less than 48 hours later, that one conversation with his coaching staff had turned into “a surreal moment” for Towns.
“The things that Mr. Tommy Amaker can do,” the Columbus, Ohio native succinctly reminisced.
Towns unfortunately missed out on that trip to Haiti, needing to stay home to undergo surgery on the injured knee he suffered in the Ivy Tournament final that season. That would be the last time the 2018 Ivy League Player of the Year would ever suit up in a Crimson uniform, as he battled through a frustrating two-surgery, two-year-long ordeal to fix the cartilage tear in the knee.
Now, the No.1 graduate transfer in the portal according to ESPN will have two seasons to fulfill his lifelong dream to play for his hometown Ohio State Buckeyes. Having had a painting of himself in an OSU jersey since he was two years old, Towns will aspire on the basketball court to accomplish something he could not obtain in his four years in Cambridge: a NCAA Tournament berth, and perhaps even more.
“Home is where the heart is,” said Towns in an announcement on Saturday night’s 11PM SportsCenter. “...That opportunity to fight for the city that raised me is so invaluable.”
But as the future Buckeye settles back down to life in Columbus — two months earlier than anticipated —Towns emphasized he will take home a multitude of new relationships, pathways, and values that have helped him become a “complete person”.
“[What] a lot of people don’t understand about Harvard Basketball is that it is a fraternity that can connect you with so many different people, so many different endeavors,” Towns said. “In my time at Harvard, I’ve had in-depth conversations with civil rights activists that I’ve looked up to when I was in high school, my favorite author [Mitch Albom], and Lloyd Blankfein, who’s Lloyd Blankfein.
“[Coach Amaker] is so adamant about exposing us to the movers and shakers of the world, and I mean it’s incredible for me.”
Towns added he continues to maintain a strong relationship with three past Institute of Politics guest speakers at Harvard Basketball-sponsored discussions - former U.S. Secretary of Education and Crimson alumni Arne Duncan ‘87, civil rights activist and sociologist Harry Edwards, and basketball analyst Clark Kellogg. Kellogg is an Ohio native himself and mentioned that the two had begun to build a connection when Towns was still at Northland High School in Columbus.
Off the court, the noted quoter of Ralph Waldo Emerson stated that he is looking into potentially pursuing a master’s degree in creative writing, something he became increasingly interested in while in college.
But it was also as much the experience of being off the court for two years that has instilled a newfound understanding of himself, and in his passion for the game. Towns credits the six other seniors in his much-heralded recruiting class for providing him with the positivity and friendship he needed throughout his four years.
“We were all in it together the whole time so… overall, we are this band of brothers,” Towns said. “I’m super thankful for those guys, they lifted me up in a lot of different ways. So I can’t thank them enough.”
The role as a co-captain this past season was also an unexpected learning experience for Towns, something that has provided him with new insight on his own game.
“I didn’t realize how much I would love the role of being the captain of the team until the games started flowing,” Towns said. “I was just as into it as I would have been if I was playing it...I was just watching basketball, trying to increase the value of the team in any way I could. So when you have that perspective for two years it absolutely changes the basketball player you are, and makes you value everything about winning.”
The one area he has taken the most out of from his coach of four years at Harvard?
“His general principles were something that I absolutely needed to implement into my game, whether it’s like strong defense or ball movement. I came in as a freshman and not to say I wanted to shoot every shot, it just wasn’t like Harvard Basketball level movement.”
With a bounty of meaningful relationships and new acumen developed both inside and outside of Lavietes Pavilion, Seth Towns returns back to Columbus with much to give — and plenty to prove.
That support base he has cemented here at Harvard — coaches, teammates, classmates, mentors, and supporters — will certainly be ready for his big moment.

Are you getting bored at home already and looking to work on your LinkedIn profile? Maybe it’s time to change your headshot from your high school yearbook photo or freshman year convocation shot to something a bit more updated. Now that you’re at home, you can make use of your parents and siblings by putting them to work. This means that you can finally commandeer a photographer to take the perfect shot without feeling guilty.
If you can leave your room, venture into the great outdoors (aka your backyard or some nearby green space) to take advantage of the sunlight. But, make sure to practice safe social distancing between you and your photographer! If you don’t have a fancy camera, no problem. Portrait Mode works nicely on your phone. Don’t forget about Photobooth and the filters you can use to add some pizzazz to your LinkedIn page. Or maybe you want to give your photo a super updated look… show off your soap and handwashing technique! Then you can add good hygiene to your skills section.
If going outside isn’t an option and you’re self-quarantining, that’s okay too. Just grab a bedsheet for a backdrop and use a self-timer to take your new headshot. If you’re looking for a more interesting background, head over to Zoom where you can take a screenshot of yourself in front of a virtual background to pretend like you’re back in Harvard Yard, on Widener steps, or maybe even in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
But why stop at your headshot? While you’re updating your LinkedIn page, take a moment to add to your experience section. Maybe add some new skills (like adaptability and creativity) and make some virtual connections to expand your network as your face-to-face connections decrease.
