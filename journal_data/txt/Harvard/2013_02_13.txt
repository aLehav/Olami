Apparently tired of extinction, Fall Out Boy is coming out with a new album, "Save Rock and Roll," and touring in a bid to win back the shattered fragments of the teenage hearts they captured so many years ago.
But before Fall Out Boy saves its genre, two emotionally overwrought Arts writers debate which of the band's earlier albums reigns supreme.
Sorrel L. Nielsen
Everyone deserves a second chance. When the pop-punk sensation released its first studio album, "Take This to Your Grave," Fall Out Boy was just an okay band. I'll admit, in middle school I yowled along to "Chicago Is So Two Years Ago," but it didn't alleviate my angst. However, they rose from the ashes of their initial mediocrity and tried again. Thus "From Under the Cork Tree" was born—the sugary rollercoaster of teen-digestible wretchedness I'd been waiting for.
The most romantic song opening ever occurs on "Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year": "Take our tears, put them on ice / Cause I swear I'd burn the city down to show you the lights." These lines capture the magic of second-time-around Fall Out Boy—they've given in to melodrama and embraced their now-trademark blend of sociopath and fictional boyfriend. This godly amalgamation wrenched sobs from all lonely girls. When I listened to "Grave," I kept waiting for the music to relieve my (many) pre-teen feelings. On "Cork Tree," I finally understood. Fall Out Boy—at their best—is meant to make you feel worse. Much worse.
On "Cork Tree," they found their niche—clever whining that makes petty complaints sound cool and dangerous. Their true calling is making girls like me think our angst is profound while offering a loud drone of not-terrible guitar chords with which to mask the sound of our sobs from our parents in the next room. And with "Cork Tree," they nailed it.
Alexander Tang
Everyone has a band that shaped their early teens, when they were at their most emotionally vulnerable and impressionable. For everyone who had a soul, that band is Fall Out Boy. While questions of favorites are often subjective, when the subject is Fall Out Boy albums, there is one right answer and four hilariously wrong answers. To state that any Fall Out Boy record other than "Take This to Your Grave" is the band's best indicates deep character flaws and a fundamental lack of understanding of music, emotion, and humanity.
While later releases from the pop-punk quartet saw more mainstream success and showcased the sort of shimmery pop production that would earn the band many of its fans, none of these albums came close to recreating the magic of "Take This to Your Grave." "Grave" was beautiful in its straightforward sincerity, with its singularly catchy riffs and aggressively sentimental lyrics. From "Cork Tree" on, melodrama and showmanship replaced honest songwriting, and bloated production blunted the clean, classically pop-punk instrumental work.
"Take This To Your Grave" is the soundtrack to your first love, your first dance, your first heartbreak. Every social misstep and sun-soaked memory of adolescence falls into place on the tracklist. But even when isolated from any personal connection, the album stands above the rest in an empirical sense. It is Fall Out Boy at their purest and most poetic, before the lures of complicated soundboards and Timbaland lead them astray. "Grave" is the best Fall Out Boy album, and I will take that conviction to my grave.

Sometimes I feel like writing for the Arts Board is a bit like being a defense attorney. Granted, there are some things on which we all agree (shout out to Kendrick Lamar and Pokemon Blue), but a large part of my artistic taste has to be defended. Not in a man-the-barricades, Battle of the Alamo sort of way, but in a more nuanced, “Inherit the Wind” fashion. My love and appreciation of certain things has to be eloquently proven to be definitively good (or at least not shit) in front of a jury of my peers.
As a second semester senior, I am using this column as my closing statement on Crimson Arts. I have chosen to use 600 to 800 words, every other week, to defend the relevancy of a select group of soul B-sides. B-sides have been sold on the reverse side of a vinyl record—the A-side was the big hit you generally wanted to buy when you went to the record store back in the day. None of the songs I chose were actually B-sides, but like the songs thrown on the back side of the single, they have been masked by their more popular or commercial counterparts. Hopefully, this column will help bring some of the songs I love out of the shadows of the hit singles so that they can bask in the light they deserve. None of these particular songs are reviled. In fact, I would say most of them are not particularly well known. But hopefully, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, by the end of this semester and this column, you will be completely and utterly convinced that the music I bring to your attention is still very much relevant.
The unifying theme of all of these songs––apart from the fact that I happen to like them––is that they have all been unfairly left out of the canon of soul classics. The fact that Marvin Gaye’s best song fits into this category is totally ridiculous, and the reasoning behind this travesty can only be attributed to Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records.
Berry Gordy approached the seven-inch single the way Henry Ford approached the Model T: Berry wanted every release on his label––incidentally one of the first corporations run by an African-American—to be made to a specific musical standard, and he wanted them produced fast. It is amazing how this approach to music provided the soundtrack to the 1960s. Most soul artists that people know—the Diana Rosses and Stevie Wonders of the world, for example––recorded at Motown, often with musical accompaniment provided by the same group of backing musicians. Berry made a lot of money, the stars made quite a bit, and the musicians behind all of the hits made virtually nothing. C’est la vie.
This brings us back to Marvin. “This Love Starved Heart of Mine,” by Gaye, might just be the best song ever recorded at Motown, but it wasn’t released until almost 30 years after it was recorded, in 1994. This was just one of those songs that inexplicably fell off of the conveyor belt in Motown’s soul-industrial-complex.
“This Love Starved Heart of Mine” starts like many other Motown standards––with a polished drum line and a bass playing a simple 4/4 beat––but this only lasts for the first three seconds. When Marvin comes in, he changes everything. He unleashes a high-pitched wail, energetic, mournful, and full of promise. Quickly he is joined by a guitar laying down a steady barrage of chords, and this swell grows with the horns and strings. By the time the first chorus comes around, the track has transformed into a runaway train. Gaye, the song’s mad conductor, urges the band on with the sort of screams and yelps that you almost never hear in his early work. But then, after three exhausting verses and choruses, it just stops. There is a shimmering crash in the drums, and it seems like the band has finally run out of steam. But then Marvin gives the song its sexiest yelp, and with a Latin-influenced horn and string run, the band picks right up to speed. “This Love Starved Heart of Mine” is big, brassy, brash, and totally fantastic.
In a slightly overwrought post-mortem, Pitchfork Media said that Outkast’s “B.O.B.” managed to prophesize every major trend in popular music in the last decade. In a similarly overblown fashion, I would say that in this three-minute rollercoaster, Marvin Gaye managed to encapsulate everything that makes pop music great. It has the driving 4/4 rhythms that White Stripes used to rock our shit in every one of their songs that is worth listening to. Gaye gives this performance the sort of raw charisma that every contestant on “The Voice” wishes he had. The bass has a relentless energy drawn from its simplicity; every bottom-heavy sort of music, from punk to hip-hop, does precisely the same thing. I could go on and on.
Take that, Outkast.

On a sweltering August evening in 2012, a plump, 34-year-old hip-hop artist, father of twins, college dropout, and self-proclaimed “B-list star” dropped his sixth album. Within hours, he became the world’s most sought-after musician. Twelve years into his career, Psy (Park Jae-sang) witnessed his fame skyrocket overnight. A few short months later, the music video for his song “Gangnam Style” hit a record-breaking one billion views, becoming the most watched video in YouTube history. Listeners and audiences on multiple continents danced along to the famous horse-dancing moves as they declared the song the pinnacle of K-pop history.
However, despite the catchy tune and addictive dance moves of “Gangnam Style,” the song is in no way K-pop’s first formal greeting to the world. Rather, the highly successful song came at the peak of the “Hallyu” Korean Wave that has been sweeping across East Asia for nearly two decades. In fact, according to some music critics, Hallyu itself is the product of nearly a century’s development of Korean music.
Though new fans may be quick to equate K-pop with Psy’s “Oppan Gangnam Style” refrain, Hallyu is a cultural phenomenon encompassing television drama series and movies, pop songs, computer games, animation, and a revival of more traditional Korean art forms. In fact, many track the term “Hallyu” back to 1999, when Chinese journalists noted the rapid influx of Korean television drama series and pop music into mainland China. Perhaps Psy’s recent success is a perfect example of being at the right place at the right time, but it is also impossible to discount Psy’s talent and knack for songwriting, nor the fact that Psy has undoubtedly kicked wide the door that had previously been only nudged open by his predecessors in the world of K-pop: award-winning actors and Korea’s first boy bands, girl groups, and solo artists.
Since then, the Korean Wave has spread into multiple venues. In 2002, South Korea made the Top 4 cut of the FIFA World Cup tournament. Women and men alike fawned over professional football player Ahn Jung-Hwan and gathered in the streets of Seoul wearing red shirts emblazoned with the phrase, “Be the Reds.” Soon after, audiences spanning from East Asia to the Asian Pacific Islands were tuning into Korean melodrama series “Autumn in My Heart” and “Winter Sonata,” the latter of which is still responsible for the annual arrival of nearly 100,000 tourists to Nami Island, the site at which “Winter Sonata” was filmed. And most recently, albums by K-pop groups Girls’ Generation and Big Bang have earned coveted positions on the Billboard 200 chart, cementing a foundation for Hallyu in the United States.
While K-pop inherently includes Korean lyrics, Korean trends, and, of course, ethnically Korean artists, its recent expansion has global appeal: most artists are now required to gain fluency in Mandarin, English, or Japanese, and often release new versions of their songs or special edition EPs in languages outside of their native tongue. In fact, many popular K-pop groups, such as 2PM of JYP Entertainment or f(x) of SM Entertainment, even contain members who are ethnically Chinese or Thai or have mixed heritage. It seems the K-pop industry has recognized the need for both local and universal appeal—for its artists to serve as proud ambassadors of the Korean culture while delivering lines in perfect, unaccented English. The ability of its artists to collaborate and perform with artists of foreign markets only adds to the continuation of K-pop’s conquest worldwide.
There is a fine line to tread between a connection with the home base and the malleability required to captivate diverse audiences; the K-pop phenomenon is carefully walking across this tightrope as it continues to tap into new fan bases worldwide. In any case, there is no doubt that K-pop’s time is here, and K-pop will only continue to grow as it rides the high tide of consumer-driven waves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve never had a big, empty stage all to myself before.  It’s a big, vacant stage, really; it looks empty, but it is only artificially so. Underneath the fresh coat of paint it holds all the old dirt and holes, scratches and marks and gestures and breaths from people past. History.
I read once that no history of anything will ever contain more than it leaves out. It’s true. People have tried, can try, and will try again. But it’s true.
So I’ve got this big vacant stage with History. I suppose this stage, as it is now, will be History too soon enough. And my dirt and holes and scratches and marks, the words that I say and the space that I take up, will be broken down and gone over with a fat brush, and they’ll say, “Wow, that stage was dirty,” or “Look at this big, empty stage I’ve got all to myself.”
And now I’ve got less than two minutes all to myself on this stage, which is hardly enough time to explain. But time’s like that, you know? You breathe in and you live and you love and you fight and fight hard to live and love as much as you can in the time you’ve got—then you breathe out.  Soon enough someone will write the books, and maybe they’ll leave you out, their words the fat brush that paints over you, concealing your history from just about everyone. So we all stand up here and fight to make a scratch or a mark deep enough that it can’t be ignored in the hope that someday someone will see it and say, “Wow, she lived hard,” or “Man, what a fight,” and that you will live on in their contemplation. And it doesn’t matter that they don’t understand yet, because they will…in time. Each man will learn what he can from histories and History, and the concerned man will be met with the same fate as one who pays no attention and lives in time as if each moment was the most important moment of his life, thinking nothing of the little scratch or mark he makes on the floor as his feet stride across it, jubilant in his ahistorical bliss.
The funny thing is that Time is so finite and also infinite; we feel it intensely in both its expansiveness and constraint, and yet it is intangible. It is all I can do not to laugh when I think of how much and how little time I have, how I’ll probably have just as much as Michelangelo or Camus or Picasso, and how I’ll never feel as though I’ve done enough, fought hard enough, dug deep enough for History to remember all the time I spent here.
And then, maybe I should laugh—when we are constantly confronted with an endless hourglass and somehow sand runs low, what else can we do?  Why not laugh?  I spend so much time slaving away and putting on masks to make this scratch and that mark that I rarely let my true self, whatever that is these days, loose; I rarely let myself run free enough to just throw my head back and laugh. But why? Because it takes too much time? All we’ve got is Time, until we don’t anymore. Use it up, be free, laugh if you can. Because, life? It’s not that serious.

I would like to be unbiased, open to new ideas, accepting of arguments that contradict my own beliefs. I am willing to put a good deal of effort into achieving these traits, because they seem unequivocally good, the hallmarks of a reasonable person. However, when I pick up a newspaper and begin reading an op-ed that I disagree with, I instinctively want to put down the paper and stop reading.
It should not be hard to read opinions that are out of line with my own—I am not so naïve as to think that my opinions represent a universal consensus—but I experience an almost visceral, negative reaction to strongly-worded arguments for beliefs that run counter to mine. This reaction is ingrained in human psychology, and helps explain why it is so difficult to truly open one’s mind and take a non-partisan approach to political issues. Confidence, on the whole, feels good. When we are confident in our opinions, we feel better about our choices, our abilities, and ourselves. Unfortunately, the human sense of confidence is derived in such a way that dissenting opinions tend to damage it, making those opinions unpleasant.
Confidence in our beliefs is based mainly on the coherence of the evidence for them, rather than the magnitude of the evidence. If I have ten pieces of evidence in favor of a belief, I will not be much more confident in that belief than if I had five. If, however, I have one piece of evidence in favor of one belief, and for another belief I have two pieces of evidence in favor, but one piece of evidence against, I will be probably more confident in the first belief. This is because all of the evidence for the first belief is coherent, whereas, even though the number of pieces of evidence in favor of the second belief is greater, the coherence of the evidence is not as great—some of the evidence is contradictory.
Naturally, the more evidence one uncovers about a given topic, the more likely one is to come across contradictory arguments. As a consequence, the less informed we are about a topic, the more likely we are to feel irrationally confident about a strongly partisan opinion. Essentially, we are rewarded for ignorance with the pleasant feeling of confidence. Technology, often a powerful force for greater dissemination of knowledge, may actually decrease the chances of overcoming our blinders of ignorance on controversial topics.
The internet has given us greater access to a wide variety of opinions on a nearly infinite list of subjects, and it is easy to assume that this should help combat close-mindedness. However, an abundance of un-vetted blog posts with no pretension to nonpartisanship has also made it much easier to find opinions that merely corroborate our own preconceptions. In an online landscape with political commentary to cater to any taste, there is no longer any need to encounter the unpleasantness of opposing arguments.
The revolution in personal data analytics further exacerbates this problem by intentionally guiding us towards opinions that reinforce rather than challenge our biases. Google’s search engine delivers individualized search results based on what you have clicked in the past. The New York Times website automatically generates a list of articles that are “recommended for you” based on those you have previously viewed. Youtube, unsurprisingly, puts personal recommendations on the homepage of its site.
To be sure, there is no harm in a computer algorithm that automatically creates a list of the cat videos and “Call Me Maybe” parodies most likely to make you laugh, but the march towards a personalized Internet is already making the digital realm less like a virtual public library and more like a private book collection, pre-populated with your favorite authors.
There are important benefits to actively seeking out opinions from the other side—one’s own argument will undoubtedly be improved by an understanding of the counter-arguments, but, perversely, one’s confidence in their own position may be shaken.
Rather than passively perusing the internet, allowing ourselves to be unconsciously guided towards articles, blogs, and videos that affirm our own ideas, we would do well to seek out sources that will challenge our preconceptions. For liberal students, the Wall Street Journal opinion pages provide high quality conservative commentary. For the republicans on campus, the New York Times editorials are worth reading, if only to allow for further complaining about the hopelessly biased, liberal media.  Although we are hard-wired to dislike ideas that we do not agree with, those ideas are often the most important ones for us to appreciate, and making a concerted effort to understand them is well worth the effort.

Institutions of higher education espouse values such as service, integrity, equality, and global responsibility. They are the intellectual and moral leaders of our time. Yet, the ways in which these institutions of higher education, like our own, invest their money is currently irresponsible and unacceptable.
When you invest in a company, you own part of that company. And if you own something, you are responsible for it. Yet inconsistencies in the things we say we value and the things we invest in abound. This discrepancy is especially crucial as it applies to institutions of higher learning. It is essential that we recognize this and do something about the fundamental contradiction.
Harvard considers itself a leader in campus sustainability, and with good reason. With impressive LEED-certified buildings and a significant carbon reduction goal, Harvard has worked to make “Green the new Crimson.” But while its campus may be green, its portfolio is not. By investing its endowment in fossil fuel companies, Harvard sponsors global climate change. You’ll never hear President Faust say: “I support global warming that threatens the future of Harvard students.” If she did, the public would be appalled. But making investments in the fossil fuel industry sends that very message, and such a practice should elicit the same disgust.
Consciously sponsoring climate change is only one example of our university’s moral inconsistency. Harvard is a member of the Fair Labor Association, meaning it only grants use of the Harvard trademark to companies that meet fair labor standards. In this way, Harvard uses its brand to promote justice. Yet, at the same time, Harvard invests in Vale S.A., a Brazilian mining corporation given the Public Eye Award for most evil company in the world, due in part to its dismal treatment of workers.
Harvard’s investment in arms manufacturing offers yet another example of moral incongruity. According to research by the Harvard School of Public Health, places with more guns have more homicides. In the aftermath of the recent tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Harvard faculty spoke out about the need for violence prevention efforts. For example, Masters of Adams House, Judith S. “Judy” ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, published an impactful piece in the New England Journal of Medicine on the topic.
But while members of the Harvard community use their research and positions of leadership to protect us from guns, Harvard continues to funnel money to arms manufacturers with its endowment. Harvard invests funds with the Vanguard Group, the largest stockholder in Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation, a leading U.S. gun manufacturer. In response to the Sandy Hook tragedy, all Vanguard had to say was “We believe that mutual funds are not optimal agents to address social change.’’
Investments in the fossil fuel industry, companies guilty of exploiting workers, and gun manufacturers all illustrate the misalignment between the values voiced by Harvard and the ownership it actually assumes through its investments.
Harvard is not alone in this practice. Ignorance and irresponsibility are ubiquitous when it comes to investing. Some will call me naïve: That this is just the way our system works. That a diversified portfolio is the key to success. That we can work to better the world in other ways.
This may be how our system works, but that doesn’t mean it’s the way it should work. We simply cannot afford to think of investments in a separate vein from morality any longer. We must not abandon the values we know to be true when it comes to making a profit.
This time might not be far away. I have so much hope for our generation.
Because of a campaign spearheaded by our classmates, beginning at the end of this year, donors will have the option of giving to Harvard’s social choice fund, which will be invested separately from the rest of the endowment in funds that meet specific criteria for social responsibility.
At the same time, the fossil fuel divestment movement, perhaps more than anything else, has illuminated our morally unacceptable investment patterns. Now students on over 250 campuses across the country are telling their administrations loudly and clearly, “If it’s wrong to wreck the planet, it’s wrong to profit off of that wreckage.”
How we make our money matters, and it shapes the kind of world in which we, ourselves, our children, and future generations will live. Money talks, and it’s time our institutions of higher education lead the way in using it to say what we mean.

“A little ball in the air,” President Eisenhower belittled the Soviet satellite Sputnik after its launch five and half decades ago, but he soon committed a billion dollars in response: not for the military but instead the schools. The 1958 National Defense Education Act boasted a hefty budget and a focus on raising math and science proficiency. Today, many have harkened back to that memory, including President Obama, who branded the present day as “our generation’s Sputnik moment” in his 2011 State of the Union address. In a particularly encouraging recent incarnation, Teach For America has placed an emphasis on recruiting young teachers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in advance of its February 15 application deadline.
The country needs more STEM teachers because it needs more STEM students. The U.S. struggles to cultivate STEM students and professionals at every level. At the elementary school stage, according to the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, the United States ranks 9th in eighth grade math and 10th in eighth grade science internationally. When they reach college, those students who do feel competent and compelled enough to declare STEM majors desert over the next four years a fifty-percent attrition rate. The deficiencies of STEM education then play out in the labor force: There are two unfilled STEM positions for every STEM worker, versus 3.6 non-STEM workers for every non-STEM position. Even after controlling for education attainment levels, a significant STEM wage premium remains in the market.
TFA’s STEM initiative, which currently has 3,200 first- and second-year teachers at work, is fighting a worthy but uphill battle—a battle that appears self-perpetuating. As Melissa Moritz, Head of TFA’s STEM initiative put it, “STEM teachers are the hardest to recruit because they have so many options right after graduation.” The wage advantages triggered by too few STEM workers lure away would-be teachers, as shortage begets shortage, with new students missing out on help from teachers trained in science and math. In middle school, over half of math teachers and 60 percent of science teachers have neither a major nor a minor in those subjects. And there are consequences. A 2008 Congressional Research Service report explains that “among those who teach math and science, having a major in the subject taught has a significant positive impact on student achievement.” Efforts like Math for America, which addresses the incentive issue via sizable bonuses and four (instead of TFA’s two) base-level years of teaching, offer real hope for progress.
This is not to laud STEM education as a national panacea. A liberal arts education and the creativity it may engender remain valuable, and not to be eschewed. Some research suggests that the American system may have an advantage in cultivating creativity. Still, for long-run economic success and equality, diminished in a world with heavy returns to STEM knowledge yet only a small slice of workers to reap them, the U.S. needs more STEM emphasis. But it also needs more than a reignited Sputnik zeitgeist. It needs specific ideas, it needs solutions, and above all it needs teachers. TFA’s new emphasis is a step in addressing the last of those three. And through the sort of seasoned alumni TFA produces, perhaps the first two as well.

Professor Michael J. Sandel is an ambitious man. In an op-ed in Prospect magazine last year, he said that “If I ruled the world, I would rewrite the economics textbooks,” which he thinks is “a small ambition, unworthy of [such a] sovereign office.” After competing with Professor Greg Mankiw for the largest class on campus for many years, it seems like the battleground has moved to textbook sales.
Professor Sandel’s objection to economics as a discipline comes from his discomfort at the marketization of public life. In his public lecture “The Perils of Thinking like an Economist” and his book “What Money Can’t Buy,” Sandel offers numerous examples of markets that challenge social norms. He claims that these markets, while innocuous in reasoning proposed by economics textbooks, create moral issues in two different ways. First, the expansion of markets causes injustice stemming from wealth inequality. In a world where kidneys can be sold and bought, for instance, wealth inequality could cause health resources to be allocated to the wealthiest rather than the neediest. Second, the formation of markets may alter the nature or character of the good being traded. Paying kids to read, for instance, changes their love for knowledge into love for money, which may deter kids from reading for fun. He blames economists for formalizing moral issues like these without consulting moral philosophy, and argues to reduce the role of markets in public life.
While I disagree with the moral contention in some of his examples, I agree that these arguments are valid criticism of the unconstrained market. His criticism is not, however, “a big step toward a more civic life” as he claims—because it is already in the very textbooks that he wants to replace.
Professor Sandel criticizes economists for applying efficiency arguments to buying and selling kidneys without thinking about its moral consequence. If Sandel cares to talk to any economist at the Harvard Faculty Club, he will find that his colleagues not only think about such moral complexities, but have also devised solutions. Instead of cash incentives, the “kidney exchange” will use an algorithm to swap donated kidneys, so that people who cannot receive donated kidneys from a loved one can still get a donated kidney from a stranger. This can improve efficiency of kidney donation based on the economic principle of coincidence of wants, but not in a morally contentious way. The study of markets without financial incentives became such an important subfield of economics that its intellectual godfather, Harvard economist Alvin E. Roth, received the Nobel Prize in Economics last year for this contribution. It is intriguing that in Sandel’s book about economists’ fixation with monetary markets, he forgets to include such alternative markets offered by mainstream economists.
More broadly speaking, economists are no strangers to difficult discussions about civic life. The great economists Kenneth J. Arrow and Amartya Sen founded the field of social choice theory, a mathematical formalism for making collective decisions with consideration of fairness, rights, liberties, and human folly. Of course, such ideas would not be included in Professor Sandel’s hypothetical textbook, because he dismisses the “rigor of natural sciences” in economics as deviant from the discipline’s origin as moral philosophy.
Since its conception, economics has come a long way from a normative political philosophy to a positive social science. David Ricardo and Alfred Marshall systemized the discipline with formal analysis. The introduction of statistical methods connected social theories with reality. Recently, economists have tentatively applied these toolkits to explain phenomena ranging from family life to social norms. With sufficient and reasonable assumptions, economists can answer difficult questions with a great dose of objectivity and rationality. Given the trajectory of economics to overtake spheres previously governed by moral philosophy, Professor Sandel is justified in questioning the role of a value-free science in public discourse.
His criticism, however, is not different from that of a weaver against the sewing machine. A value-free framework offers a platform for discussions driven by scientific consensus. Put simply, before deciding what a society should choose, people must agree on what society will do when given choices. Existing economics textbooks teach the latter, but Professor Sandel would prefer students to learn the former. Given that Sandel prefers to have students arrive at their own conclusion in his Justice class, it is not clear why he would prefer to teach students the moral limits of markets, rather than teach them how to think independently concerning such questions, with sound tools from economics.
In his attack on the field of economics, Professor Sandel caricatured the discipline as being narrowly focused on the cost-free transaction of a private good between two rational individuals, a conclusion that would not be surprising if he stopped reading an economics textbook after the first chapter. If Professor Sandel continued reading, he would find that economic thought gives great importance to social cost, as in environmental economics, or justice, as in social choice theory, or market irrationality, as in behavioral economics.
Professor Sandel’s book may offer insights about moral concerns in markets, but he chooses to ignore the comprehensive intellectual framework that already addresses his concerns. Instead of rewriting economics textbook altogether, Professor Sandel may make better use of his time picking up the economics textbook that he evidently forgot to finish reading.

Harvard Law School alumna and author Susan Cain visited the Harvard Bookstore on Feb. 7 to promote her book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.” Published in 2012, “Quiet” explores and questions contemporary views on introversion. FM sat down with Cain before she headed home to New York.
Fifteen Minutes: “Quiet” argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and that we lose a lot in doing so. How did you get the idea to write about this topic?
Susan Cain: Well, I think in many ways I’ve had the idea all my life; since I was a young child I’ve been aware of these dynamics,  although I never had a language for it. I studied here and went off to become a lawyer in New York, and had the idea that to be a good lawyer you had to be a bold, gregarious, swashbuckling kind of person and I knew I wasn’t, so I thought I was at a big disadvantage. But then when I got to the practice of law, I looked around and I realized that many of my colleagues who were best at what they did were introverts. They were quiet and reflective and they were using those traits well.  I thought we needed to have a language for talking about that.
FM: Speaking of this language, how would you define the word “introvert”? What are the biggest misconceptions about introverts?
SC: You know you’re an introvert if you find yourself needing to recharge your batteries on your own. Imagine that you’ve been at a party for two hours and you’ve had a really good time. At the end of those two hours, do you feel like you’re craving more and you want to stay all night? That’s how extroverts tend to feel. Or do you start to feel depleted? No matter how good a time you’ve had, you might feel depleted, drained of energy. And you get your energy from being in a quieter setting. The misconceptions about introverts are that they’re antisocial, unfriendly, uncaring, and in fact they’re really not—they just want to socialize in quieter ways.
FM: How would you differentiate between introversion and shyness, two often associated words?
SC: They’re really not the same, because shyness is about the fear of social judgment. So you could be the kind of person I was describing before—someone who gets their energy from being on their own and needs to recharge that way—without being especially fearful about other people’s opinions. So there’s some overlap, but not completely.
FM: Can you explain some of the research surrounding introversion and how science is helping us to better understand introverts?
SC: There’s really interesting research on babies being born with different levels of reactivity to stimulation, and the babies who are most reactive to stimulation are the ones who grow up to be introverts because they feel more of the things that are coming at them from the minute they’re born. If you give them sugar water to suck on, they suck on it more dramatically than other kids do. And those same kids, when they’re presented with a new social situation, react more strongly to it.
FM: Do you think it’s possible to be a little bit of both—a little introverted and a little extroverted—or to be different in different situations, or is everyone one or the other?
SC: I think everybody’s a mix of both. And even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms in the 1920s, said there’s no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert. He said such a man would be in a lunatic asylum.
FM: The tagline for your book is “The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.” What is this power, exactly?
SC: The power is really many-fold. We know many of the most creative people across time have been introverts because solitude is a crucial ingredient of creativity. We know from management research, interestingly, that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do. So those are two to start with—leadership and creativity.
FM: In the introduction of your book, you use Rosa Parks as an example of an introvert who had a quiet but powerful courage. Who are some prominent figures today who you would consider introverted?
SC: That’s an interesting question. President Obama, I would guess, is an introvert. Larry Page, at Google, Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo. Those are a few.
FM: One chapter of your book describes the benefits and challenges of being part of an introvert-extrovert couple. Since Valentine’s Day is coming up, what advice would you give to introverted college students in relationships with extroverts, and vice versa?
SC: The first piece of advice is to negotiate in advance how often you’re going to socialize as a couple, because if one person wants to be going out all the time and the other person wants to hang out at home and be cozy, that can cause conflict. You don’t want to negotiate that every night, so figure out in advance how often you are going to go out per week, agree to it, and stick to that plan.
FM: Harvard seems built for people who are willing to put themselves out there, whether in class, extracurriculars, or social settings. How can our school be doing to better cater to introverts?
SC: Well, I don’t know that Harvard is really set up only for extroverts. My experience of it actually was that it’s an environment that also rewards quiet scholarship; it’s an environment where people can connect one-on-one and can connect with each other around shared passions. Those are all ways introverts want to interact, so I think it works very well.
FM: I read “Quiet” over winter break, after my mom—who is a self-proclaimed introvert—made my entire family complete your book’s “Are you introverted or extroverted?” quiz at the dinner table. Your book not only made me question where I stood on the introvert-extrovert scale, but it also helped me understand my mom’s personality in a whole new light. I’m guessing you would consider that a success story in terms of changing perceptions about introversion. What’s been your most rewarding success story from the publication of this book?
SC: I can’t even say the most rewarding story because there have been so many. But I can tell you just the other day I met a young woman who told me she had always wanted to be an entrepreneur, but she said she had felt like a sorry excuse for an entrepreneur because she was too quiet and she imagined that to start a company you had to be a much more “out there” kind of person. And she said she read the book and watched my TED talk, and the next day she started her company and it’s doing really well.

“Here at Harvard I have had no experience offline dating,” says Linda Trujano ’15. Despite the wind and chill of a brutal winter day, Trujano radiates an easygoing warmth, with her wavy, highlighted hair perfectly coiffed, cheeks bright pink from the cold. “Harvard’s dating scene is almost nonexistent, so I was sad about it and that’s why I decided to join [DateMySchool],” she explains. Since joining the online dating site, Trujano has gone on multiple dates with students from MIT and Harvard’s graduate schools, much to the envy of her friends and, it would appear, Harvard at large.
Trujano is one of an increasing number of college students who use online dating tools to enhance their sexual and romantic relationships. From 1999 to 2009, the percentage of couples who met online surged from 10.9 percent to 23.2 percent nationally, according to a study from the University of Rochester. And the phenomenon is no longer limited to older adults: Over the past few years, websites such as DateMySchool and IvyDate emerged as online dating sites specifically for college students.
“DateMySchool is responsible for over 50 percent of the dates that happen at Columbia and NYU. We get success stories every single day,” says DateMySchool public relations director Melanie J. Wallner, who has surveyed hundreds of students from both universities. Although the students who participate in online dating on campus maintain a low profile, according to Wallner, one in five students across Harvard University uses DateMySchool.
The rise of college-oriented online dating sites, some students say, is symptomatic of a student population that is frustrated with the social options on campus. Currently, many Harvard students are disappointed with the existing dating scene on campus, which they often categorize as a polarized landscape of committed relationships and casual one-night hookups. “It seems to me that you either have two extremes,” says Jacob D. Roberts ’13-’14, an inactive Crimson News editor and former OkCupid user. “People are in long-term relationships or people hook up a few times and then it’s over, and there’s really no in-between.”
Whether in response to a limited dating scene or simply as a means of meeting people outside the Harvard bubble, Harvard students are increasingly turning to online dating as an alternative—a way to supplement their sexual and romantic lives. Online dating provides students with the opportunity to look beyond the physical Harvard campus for everything from a one-night stand to a long, dreamy courtship. Whether dating across campuses or meeting young professionals, students find that these tools have proved invaluable in enlarging their social networks. Love online is still far from perfect, but there seems to be a trend towards a social lifestyle that involves both online and offline dating.
A Stigmatized Practice
Although the use of online dating tools is on the rise, there is still a significant social stigma attached to its use that prevents a meaningful dialogue on campus. The stereotype of online daters as social recluses eating fast food as they hunch over a computer monitor and talk to strangers thousands of miles away still lingers in the public eye.
The history of online dating plays a large role in the development of this negative perception of the practice. “Online dating was basically dominated by geeks,” says Sam A. Yagan ’99, recalling its early days.
Yagan, founder and CEO of OkCupid, and now the CEO of Match.com, was an applied math concentrator at Harvard. He continues, “Think about it: The only people on the Internet in 1993 were geeks....If you were single in the 90s, you were cool, and you probably didn’t use the Internet or online date.”
Additionally, there exists an expectation that finding a significant other should be relatively easy in a college environment, where one is constantly surrounded by one’s peers. “Online dating here has become a sign of desperation. You’re still young, you’re still in college,” says Michael Hughes ’15, who is in a long-term relationship with a student he did not meet online.
And yet, meeting new people can often become more difficult as one progresses through college.
“People usually forget that once you’ve joined various clubs and activities, there’s going to be a bit of stasis in your lives,” says Paul W. Eastwick, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the psychology of romantic relationships and online dating.
On Campus: Dating, Hook-Ups, and Frustrations
In addition to this stasis that Eastwick mentions, some posit that Harvard students especially tend not to prioritize dating. “It’s hard to actually meet people, especially in a community like Harvard, where everyone is so busy and no one stops to get to know each other,” says Jake, a gay freshman from California who has used OkCupid. Jake was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he wanted to keep his sexual orientation private.
“We just seem to not have time to go out to the North End, or go to a nice restaurant, or take a walk through the park,” says Hughes, echoing Jake’s sentiment. According to The Crimson’s senior survey of the Class of 2012, 48.6 percent of women and 49.4 percent of men reported having dated zero to one person at Harvard.
The lack of dating at Harvard may not only be a function of time constraints, but also one of space constraints. “There’s probably less social spaces to meet people. It seems classes or extracurriculars are your only option, while other universities have more of a common meeting area,” remarks Earle J. Bensing ’14, treasurer of the Harvard Computer Society, which oversees the ubiquitous Valentine’s Day matching program Datamatch.
Some believe that “hookups,” on the other hand, are far more common on Harvard’s campus. Sociologist Lisa Wade, who spoke at Harvard’s 2012 Sex Week, defines a hook-up as “casual sexual contact between non-dating partners without an (expressed or acknowledged) expectation of forming a committed relationship.”
“We definitely don’t go on dates like my mom’s generation did, and we definitely hook up a lot faster,” says Blair as she looks quickly around CGIS cafe. Blair, a sophomore concentrating in Social Studies and a Tinder user, was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she did not want others to know that she goes online for dating.
“[Students] are away from their parents for the first time—they’re going to explore their sexuality and they’re not going to stay with one person and have sex with one person only,” says Tai, a sophomore OkCupid and Grindr user who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson because he wanted to keep the details of his dating life private. “Which is not to say that there aren’t exceptions, but I’m just saying that that was my experience when I was a freshman. Most people are here to sort of find out what the market is like.”
Despite this perception, according to The Crimson’s Class of 2012 senior survey, 80.3 percent of women and 66.7 percent of men have had sex with fewer than five people, which means at most one new sexual partner each year. Harvard also falls below the national average among other colleges in terms of its hookup count: The average number of hookups for a graduating college senior nationally is seven. Around 25 percent of college students do not hook up at all, according to a study conducted by Paula England, a sociology professor at Stanford University.
Online Dating: The Low Down
For some Harvard students who aren’t looking to participate in the hookup culture on campus, and are dissatisfied with the dating scene, sites like OkCupid or DateMySchool seem to be a natural option to pursue. Trujano decided to make her DateMySchool account after one of her friends went on several dates from the site.
“I’ve mostly gone out on dates with MIT grad students—I guess because there’s not a lot of girls over there,” she says, chuckling as she quickly tucks a wavy strand of hair behind her ear. “I remember when one my friends saw that in one week I had five dates, she was like, ‘Whoa, I want to join.’”
Online dating sites can set up dates across campuses as well as help forge connections here at Harvard. “OkCupid could be a real functional tool to connect people who otherwise could float through their Harvard career and never meet each other,” Roberts says. “Datamatch only gets you so far.”
As students begin to go on dates obtained through these sites, they find the stigma associated with online dating to be unfounded. “The whole point of online dating is for it to transition to real life dating,” says Philip de Sa e Silva ’13, who used OkCupid in the past but has temporarily disabled his account.
Even so, online dating is not something participants typically discuss on campus. “It’s not something you wear on your sleeve or advertise. When you tell most people they laugh and treat it as a joke, but after having had a good experience, I do take it seriously,” Roberts says.
Although it is intended to describe a unique type of interaction, the term “dating” is incredibly broad. Sites such as OkCupid highlight the diversity and nuances of the word. Users can search these websites to find friends, “activity partners” to watch a movie or go hiking with, and DateMySchool even has an option for “cuddling.”
Additionally, in a world that seems to shrink as technology expands, meeting someone completely new has become a novelty in and of itself. “It’s interesting to be Facebook friends with someone I’ve met online and see that we have no friends in common at all. There’s no chain of connection, and that’s neat,” Silva says.
“I’ve had fantastic dates outside of campus with people who are adults and do things other than meet in dining halls and go over to each other’s dorms,” says Tai, waving his hand and gesturing towards his own dorm. “You’d be surprised how much easier it is to arrange for a group of people who are not in school to go out together than to get a bunch of your own friends [together].”
And for students who find themselves in totally new environments—either during the summer, or after graduation—the geocentric function of the sites allow these students to make new connections. “I actually created a profile because this summer I was in the Hamptons trying to start a business,” says Roberts. “I was working out there full time, so during the week I wanted to find a way to meet people, to meet girls, and just going to bars wasn’t cutting it, and so I joined.” Roberts did meet someone in the Hamptons using OkCupid, although he doesn’t think he’ll marry her.
Gay on Grindr
While sites like Match.com and OkCupid were originally created for the purpose of connecting people for dates, newer mobile applications like Grindr have burst onto the scene with more explicit purposes. Harvard students have taken advantage of this technology as a quick and convenient way to find sexual satisfaction, bypassing dating, flirting, and other time-consuming interactions.
Joel Simkhai, a graduate of Tufts University, founded Grindr in 2009 as a geosocial app to connect gay males in real time. “For me, what I really wanted to make happen was to make it easier for gay men to meet each other,” says Simkhai, whose app has over four million users. They come from every country in the world, except for two small island nations in the South Pacific.
Grindr is used primarily for casual sex, and Simkhai is unapologetic about its function. “Part of what happens when you meet someone that you’re attracted to is that you want to have sex with them. That’s just natural behavior,” Simkhai explains. “If that’s how our users want to use the product, as long as we’re giving them a good service, we’re happy with that,” he says matter-of-factly.
While Simkhai has no qualms about the popularity of his product, the unprecedented accessibility the app allows for has elicited significant criticism for enabling promiscuity. “I think some people don’t like the notion that we are letting people meet faster and more conveniently,” notes Simkhai. “People worry that we’re making it too easy."
Unlike most online dating apps and sites, Grindr allows users to see exactly how far away they are from the person they’re talking to. “It’s like a real gaydar. It’s an infallible gaydar,” Jake explains, smiling and cocking his head to the side.
The app’s networking capabilities help students locate potential partners, which is particularly helpful for gay males who don’t consider themselves to be active members of the gay community. As Jake puts it, “Not every person attends QSA meetings.”
When asked how many messages he receives a day from Grindr, Bryan, a student at the College who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he wants to keep the details of his sexual life private,  laughs and says, “If it’s [a picture] of my abs, I’ll get quite a few, and it also depends on location. I was abroad this winter and just in one day I literally got like 40 [messages].” Since downloading Grindr this past summer, Bryan has slept with eight men he met on the app, and his encounters range from casual sex with a 27-year-old graduate school student, to a threesome over winter break.
Grindr allows for meetings to occur beyond the typical going-out nights of the weekend. “It’s not about not being able to do a party hookup, it’s about whatever’s easier and more convenient,” Tai says.
Bryan argues that hooking up through Grindr may even be preferable to what occurs on campus. “The hook-up culture is drug-fueled. There’s alcohol involved to ease the tension and the awkwardness of sex, whereas with these online applications it’s not. You’re entering into a contract sober,” Bryan says, choosing his words carefully. “I think there’s more of an openness and honesty that is important when entering into sexual relations.” The digital barrier doubles as a physical barrier until participants decide to meet in person.
When asked if casual sex is more acceptable than before—perhaps as a result of the advent of dating apps like Grindr—Tai responds: “No, I don’t think people’s values have changed,” he says. “If you’re the kind [of person] that would take someone home from a party, or follow someone home from a party, then there really shouldn’t be an issue with Grindr.”
Tinder-ing
For all the criticism directed at Grindr, the application has proved increasingly popular in the gay male community—it was only a matter of time before another geosocial phone application emerged that enables both heterosexual and homosexual users to contact each other.
Blair, a sophomore, giggles as she swipes her thumb up and down her iPhone. Pictures of men come and go across the screen. She recognizes some of them, like the boy from her tutorial. Others are strangers.
This app, Tinder, was launched in October 2012 and has captivated Blair, along with the rest of the Harvard community. Part of Tinder’s intrigue is its simplicity, as well as the general assumption that users need not hook-up, or even meet. Tinder members can only adjust two settings: sexual preference and geographic range. They then rate each other as “hot” or “not.” Users are only matched when they approve each other, which subsequently allows them to chat.
Unlike the way students typically use Grindr—for casual sexual encounters—most users have adopted a more playful relationship with Tinder, counting how many matches they have rather than following up with these contacts.
“There’s no effort to get it up and running,” says Roberts, referring to Tinder, which connects automatically to users’ Facebook accounts. “With an OkCupid profile, I know I slaved over my profile, acutely aware of how it might be perceived by others.”
“It’s really funny because I’ll be in class, and I’ll see people on Tinder. Or at dinner I’ll see people on Tinder, and you never really know if people are doing it seriously,” Blair says.
The app’s popularity has even led to Tinder parties on campus. “The Pudding freshman members decided to have a party in which guests are invited using Tinder,” recalls Patrick, a member of the Hasty Pudding Club who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want it known that he had violated the club’s policy against speaking to Crimson reporters.
“There were zero Harvard girls [invited]. There was one person who had brought their whole sorority, so there were many, many girls who decided to come after [virtually] meeting a stranger,” Patrick says of the party. Hasty Pudding Club president Thomas J. Hanson '13 originally declined to comment on the party, then later wrote in an email that it was not a Hasty Pudding Club party. However, one other Club member and two attendees confirmed that the Tinder party happened.
For Patrick and his friends, the gesture was light-hearted, rooted in novelty and convenience as opposed to a serious desire to meet new people. “It’s generally more awkward to hook up with people from school because you know you’re going to see those same people for the next four years,” he says. Patrick concludes, “It’s hard to be totally casual [on campus]. On Tinder, there’s more anonymity that allows you be more casual.”
However, such an easygoing attitude means that current Tinder users may not stick around for long. Blair, who originally created her account as a joke, laughs it off. “I think it’s a one-hit wonder,” she says. “It’s kind of fun to sit there and do it, but [only] for a couple days.”
Roberts echoes Blair’s thoughts about Tinder. “I’ve downloaded it, I’ve been fucking around with it, but it’ll never blossom into anything. I bet that everyone will be deleting it after a month—I really do think it’s a very temporary phenomenon,” he says.
Bryan theorizes that while a hookup app works for gay men, it may not achieve the same level of popularity in the heterosexual community. “Grindr has more of a sexualized aspect to it, and that’s because of a culture that has emerged in the gay community in which sex is treated more liberally and also as a response to the stigmatization of sexuality within the greater society—so you had bathhouses and whatever—so this is, just for me, a new form of [that] for the gay community,” he explains quickly. “Straight people have easier access to sex than gay people [do].’’
A Perfect System?
Despite the multitude of online dating options that exist—OkCupid, Grindr, Tinder, or even Harvard’s very own Datamatch—these platforms are far from the end-all, be-all of dating on campus. Online dating, like many other forms of social interaction, retains its own set of inherent limitations. Vibrant debate about the effectiveness of online dating’s methodology and efficiency continues.
College Fellow in Statistics Cassandra W. Pattanayak ’06, who teaches a course at Harvard titled “Real-Life Statistics,” has doubts about the effectiveness of online dating’s survey questions. “The information that they’re gathering is based on survey questions that may not be worded well, so the information is useless, or you’re going to get matches that aren’t good matches,” Pattanayak says. She poses the hypothetical question “How many people have you dated in the past?” and points out that terms like “dated” or “past” aren’t strictly defined, thus calling into question the statistical validity of users’ answers.
Eastwick, the professor who has studied the differences between traditional and online dating, has another hesitation about online dating: user generated profiles. “Profiles are a terrible way to determine how you could get along with someone,” he says. “Profiles may even raise your expectations and dash them when you meet face to face.”
Eastwick is also unsure of the validity of the algorithms used by dating sites. “We have strong reason to believe that algorithms cannot work in principle. Science does suggest that there is very little you can learn about how a relationship will go before two people meet.” He points out that the algorithms created by sites like eHarmony are not published or peer reviewed, which has caused the scientific community to doubt their efficacy.
Kendall L. Sherman ’15, who created a matching algorithm for her CS50 final project, argues that human attraction cannot be boiled down to an exact science. “I don’t think that you can explain why you like someone. Those sites are asking ‘Oh, do you like walking outdoors?’ and then assuming that if I like walking outdoors, then I’ll like guys that do.”
Taking the Chance
The success of online dating may not be solely dependent on the success of lines of code or mathematical algorithms though. College-age users may simply benefit from meeting people beyond their houses or clubs and find something worthwhile in the opportunity to meet someone new, to take a risk.
Every Valentine’s Day, the Harvard Computer Society invites all students to take that risk with Datamatch, the university’s very own version of online dating. Created in 1993, the program uses a computer-generated matching algorithm to produce a list of 10 possible soulmates on campus.
Saagar Desphande ’14, president of the Harvard Computer Society, explains that Datamatch was originally created “as a joke...[with] questions about things that occurred recently, some nerdy jokes, and some things that we just think would be generally appealing.” The program continues to reflect its lighthearted origins, with questions ranging from the “kinkiest thing you own” to “One tequila, two tequila, three tequila...”
Perhaps as a result of Datamatch’s comical nature, many students view the program as merely amusing and highly non-committal, resulting in very few people meeting, or even contacting, their computer-generated matches. However, last year the program attracted over a third of Harvard College students, according to HCS, signalling that while online dating may carry a social stigma, people are indeed reaching out through digital platforms.
And for all its seemingly random questions, Datamatch has successfully programmed romance at Harvard. “I got the results and I didn’t know anyone on the list,” recalls Andrew Q. Blinkinsop ‘13, who participated in Datamatch 2011. “But a couple of days after I got the results, I got an email from this girl I had been matched with.”
Blinkinsop’s email, sent by Elizabeth A. Horton ’13 read: “No pressure, but why do Datamatch if you’re not trying to meet new people from it?” The two had never spoken before, but Blinkinsop was intrigued.
“The fact that she took the initiative and reached out to me and emailed me—that’s a quality I admire,” he says. Blinkinsop and Horton decided to go on a first date: ice-cream at JP Licks, followed by a walk along the river. Second-semester juniors at the time, they had many mutual friends and had even been in the same Expos class.
About a month after their first date, the two began a relationship and are currently approaching their one-year anniversary. “I spent Thanksgiving with her family and then she came down to Palm Springs over J-Term and went with me to my family reunion,” Blinkinsop says.
While Blinkinsop likely would not have met Horton otherwise, he questions the validity of Datamatch’s methodology. “The questions were completely irrelevant to what I consider my ideal partner would be. They’re silly questions,” he jokes.
Nonetheless, Blinkinsop doesn’t write off Datamatch: “I think there’s something to be said for taking a risk on something that might seem random at first.” He gushes as he offers advice for future Datamatchers, “It’s worked out better than I could have ever imagined. Be bold and take risks."
Users of OkCupid, DateMySchool, Grindr, and other online dating or hookup applications have also found that, at the end of the day, online dating just makes sense. “The argument will go that in college you’re constantly interacting with so many people that you don’t really need these websites,” says Tai. “But the way I see it, there’s really no harm in expanding your horizons and casting your net wider.”
For Yagan, the transition from online dating to offline dating is seamless: “It’s not about online dating or offline dating—people want to date and if you’re single and you want to date, it makes sense to date in a variety of ways,” Yagan says. “You shouldn’t just be an online dater or an offline dater. You should just date.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The computer science concentration has nearly doubled in size in the last two years and continues to drive growth in Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, according to new data released by the SEAS Communications Office.
Following sophomore concentration declarations last November, there were 215 computer science concentrators at the College, compared to 156 a year ago and 109 the year before. SEAS currently boasts 678 undergraduate concentrators, up 20 percent from last year.
According to John G. Morrisett, professor of Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II,” SEAS’ emphasis on solid introductory courses has helped to attract undergraduates.
“CS50 and David Malan have just been a great gateway for computer science,” Morrisett said. “Similarly, ES50 and other intro courses have made it easier and more fun for a broader range of students [to explore SEAS].”
Morrisett said that in addition to the increased number of SEAS concentrators, there has been extensive growth in the number of students taking SEAS classes.
“My class has maybe 40, 50 concentrators, but then there’s roughly 200 students who aren’t CS concentrators taking the class,” Morrisett said. “The reality is that for almost any field that you’re in now...you’re going to use computation.”
The numbers of students concentrating in applied mathematics and biomedical engineering grew in November to 227 and 48, marking increases of 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively.
SEAS did see a decline in the number of students pursuing both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering sciences. However, these changes can be at least partly attributed to the influx of students into the new stand-alone electrical and mechanical engineering concentrations. As of Tuesday, 21 students have declared concentrations in electrical engineering and 26 have done so in mechanical engineering.
David Campos ’15, who switched to the mechanical engineering concentration this semester, said that he thinks the new programs may foster further growth in SEAS by attracting engineering students.
“[The lack of a mechanical engineering concentration] was possibly the biggest thing that was pushing me away from choosing Harvard,” Campos said. “I think the addition of the new concentration is definitely going to open up the eyes of prospective students.”
While students and faculty see growth as a positive trend, they also recognize organizational challenges and difficulties in maintaining a close-knit classroom environment.
This year, CS51 has had to relocate eight of its 16 sections to classrooms in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences due to a lack of space in SEAS.
“This is somewhat problematic because most of the FAS rooms are not equipped with enough outlets [or] white boards to effectively teach CS sections,” assistant head teaching fellow Anna V. Gommerstadt ’13 wrote in an email.
Morrisett said that a growing teaching staff is also necessary to accommodate the increased enrollment in computer science classes.
“The most important thing [for dealing with growth] is being able to hire TFs,” Morrisett said. “That’s the only way we can expect courses like CS50 and CS51 to manage that growth.”
Most computer science classes draw heavily from undergraduates to fill teaching staff positions, Morrisett said. This year, CS51 is led by 16 undergraduate teaching fellows and a head teaching fellow who is a graduate student, according to the course website.
“While [growth] may seem from one perspective overwhelming, it also brings in a lot of people who could potentially help out with those classes,” said Kevin M. Schmid ’15, a current CS51 teaching fellow. “With the increased number of concentrators comes an increasing number of possible staff members.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, the University of Texas at Austin announced a roster of nine edX courses to be offered in the 2013-2014 academic year, with topics ranging from globalization and energy to pharmaceutics and music.
UTx is University of Texas’s subset of edX, the nonprofit virtual learning initiative launched by Harvard and MIT last May, and is still in its formative stages. After announcing its partnership with edX this past October, UTx held a proposal competition for online course topics that received more than 20 submissions from its faculty.
The four courses which will be offered this fall are “Ideas of the Twentieth Century” by philosophy professor Daniel Bonevac and photography curator Roy Flukinger, “Introduction to Globalization” with Germanic studies professor John Hoberman, “Bench to Bedside: Introduction to Drug Development and the Commercialization Process” taught by pharmaceutics professors Janet Walkow and Alan Watts and online programs director Donna Kidwell, and “Energy Technology & Policy” with mechanical engineering professor Michael Webber.
“The costs [of higher education] have been spiraling so extraordinarily over the past couple decades, and I wanted to be able to do an online course free of profit considerations,” said Bonevac.
The university will also offer five new edX courses in spring 2014, including “Jazz Appreciation” with music professor Jeffrey Hellmer, “Foundations of Data Analysis” taught by statistics faculty members Catherine Stacy and Michael Mahometa, “Mathematics and Effective Thinking” from mathematics professor Michael Starbird, “Introduction to Embedded Systems” with electrical engineering professors Jonathan Valvano and Ramesh Yerraballi, and “Linear Algebra: Theory and Computation” taught by computer science professors Robert van de Geijn and Margaret Myers. The range of courses represent edX’s growing focus on both the humanities and the sciences.
“With the prestige of Harvard and MIT being involved in edX, this is being done by people who want to put education first and who want to do it well,” Bonevac said.
While some UT professors expressed a preference for working with edX over other platforms such as edX’s for-profit competitor Coursera, others did not strongly favor one model over the other.
“The university has signed an agreement with edX, so when we were interested in putting the [globalization] course online, edX would be the company that did it,” said Hoberman, a former Harvard professor.
Regardless of which platform universities pursue, Hoberman said that he believed online education was an important next step in the democratization of education.
“Online education is going to be huge, in a word,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The voices of a crowd of women fell to a hush in the Mount Vernon Ballroom at the Sheraton Commander Hotel as the clock hit 7 p.m. 174 pairs of hands rushed to tear open envelopes containing cards revealing the identity of their new sisters. The women shrieked with excitement as they ran to locate their sororities.
At this year’s bid day, sororities at Harvard extended bids, or offers of acceptance, to 174 girls, a modest decrease from the 199 bids offered last year. Each of the three sororities on campus, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma, met the limit of at least 54 new members.
Approximately 250 women—about the same as last year—attended the first recruitment event a little more than a week ago.
Many of the approximately 75 women who were not extended bids were not rejected due to lack of space in the chapters but rather chose to drop out of the recruitment process independently.
“The majority of them chose to withdraw on their own,” said Taylor A. Compton ’13, president of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council.
Some of the women who removed themselves from recruitment have their eyes set on joining Alpha Phi, a fourth sorority open to College women. Alpha Phi is currently in the process of establishing a presence ahead of its inaugural year on campus.
“A lot of girls showed interest in Alpha Phi,” said Natalia Duarte ’14, vice president of recruitment for the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council.
Alpha Phi representatives from other colleges around the East Coast were present at the first two rounds of recruitment, but their formal recruitment process will take place later this month, with bid day falling on Feb. 28. Women who accepted bids from one of the other sororities may not continue with Alpha Phi recruitment, but those who did not participate in recruitment at all are still eligible to join Alpha Phi.
Members of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council have worked to inform women about the addition of Alpha Phi to Greek life at Harvard by talking to students and sporting Alpha Phi memorabilia such as water bottles and pins.
“We’re all walking around and trying to spread the word on campus,” Duarte said.
After the women received the bids from their sororities, each chapter held their own festivities to welcome the new members.
This year’s recruitment activities were delayed by blizzard Nemo, which brought two feet of snow to Cambridge this past weekend.

CORRECTION: Feb. 13, 2013
An earlier version of a teaser accompanying this article incorrectly indicated that 175 bids had been extended to women rushing sororities at Harvard on Tuesday. In fact, 174 bids were offered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the seventeenth century, Harvard students were required to take three years each of Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Syriac as well as demonstrate fluency in Latin as part of their graduation requirements, according to The Crimson.
In 1968, the Harvard faculty voted to introduce the one-year language requirement that College students know today. Students can demonstrate their competency at a foreign language through SAT or Advanced Placement scores, or by achieving an adequate result on Harvard’s language placement exams.
But for those who still need to fulfill their language requirement, or wish to expand their language capabilities, Harvard consistently offers more than 80 languages each semester. While widely-spoken tongues like Spanish and French attract the most people, students enrolled in obscure language classes say that although those programs may have a smaller presence on campus, Harvard is willing to accommodate their language needs.
A NATIONAL LANGUAGE RESOURCE CENTER
As of press time, seventy-seven College students are enrolled in the beginning level French Ab course this semester. One-hundred-and-fifty-three take Spanish Ab. Intermediate Welsh has one student.
Catherine McKenna, chair of the Celtic languages and literatures department and a professor of Welsh, says she thinks students may not immediately be attracted to her class because unlike the highly-enrolled romance languages, it is not “in an English speaker’s comfort zone.”
Daniel R. Rafinejad, a language preceptor who teaches beginning Persian, says students may not want to study the language because they have limited access to countries like Afghanistan, Iran, and Tajikistan, where the language is spoken. The elementary Persian class taught by Rafinejad enrolls seven undergraduates.
Welsh and Persian are not the only languages to which Harvard devotes resources despite small enrollment numbers. This semester there is one undergraduate each studying  Luganda, Uyghur, and Akkadian.
While interest may be small, Harvard does what it can to accommodate those who wish to take uncommon languages.
According to professors and students, Harvard will occasionally offer additional language courses if a student demonstrates a curricular or academic need for taking the class.
Michael T. Feehly ’14, a history concentrator with an interest in Scandinavian studies, found himself unable to study the Norwegian language because Harvard did not offer classes past the introductory level. Feehly petitioned the Administrative Board to increase Norwegian language offerings, arguing that he needed them to continue his thesis work. Last semester he was the only student enrolled in Norwegian Ba.
“It’s literally me and the [teaching fellow] in a room for an hour,” Feehly said in December. “It’s kind of stressful because basically all of the attention is on me.”
Harvard’s dedication to supporting obscure language courses has garnered recognition from the federal government. The University has been designated a National Resource Center for Foreign Language, Area, and International Studies under the US Department of Education Title VI, and as a result received $1,184,483 in 2012 to fund languages labeled as “African,” “East Asian,” “Eurasian,” and Middle Eastern.” It will receive the same amount of money for those languages in 2013.
“If you can’t study it at a place like Harvard—if you can’t pursue ancient languages, obscure languages like Akkadian..., languages that don’t exist anymore—if Harvard doesn’t teach them, where will they be taught?” says professor Mark C. Elliott, who teaches Manchu.
A WORTHWHILE PURSUIT
Obscure languages offered at Harvard face challenges when trying to attract students. Those languages like Spanish and Chinese that garner the largest enrollments are spoken around the world and can add critical skills to a resume.
Even so, those involved in Harvard’s uncommon language programs maintain that the courses are worth preserving.
“The number of speakers of a language does not determine how important a language is,” says Feehly.
Students and professors say they often face questions about why they devote time to learning something many may consider impractical.
Elliott says the language he teaches derives its academic value from its historical applications.
One out of every five documents from the Qing Dynasty, of which Manchu is an endangered primary language, is written in the language, according to Elliott. Because of his knowledge of Manchu, a language known by very few people, Elliott was able to investigate documents that had never been read before.
Students choose to take uncommon languages for a variety of reasons. Elena F. Hoffenberg ’16 says she was drawn to the study of Yiddish for personal reasons. “On a very personal level it’s a way for me to connect with my predecessors,” she says. The five students enrolled in McKenna’s Welsh class chose the language in order to pursue everything from thesis work to “ something interesting and off-beat,” says McKenna.
For Elliott, the University is a prime location for exploring obscure languages.
“Harvard is the kind of place where people need to be able to pursue esoteric subjects,” he says. “The world looks to Harvard to provide instruction in exactly those kinds of areas—that is one of the beautiful things about Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students crowded into the Harvard Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday night to watch President Obama deliver his first State of the Union Address since his re-election in November. Obama used the address to outline his second-term strategy and present strong opinions on the economy, research and development, infrastructure, the cost of higher education, immigration reform, and gun control.
The President opened with a series of economic proposals focused largely on strengthening the middle class.  He addressed the issue of consistently high levels of unemployment and the need to cut spending and increase taxes on the wealthy in order to reduce the federal deficit. He also stressed the importance of investing in rapidly deteriorating infrastructure to help bolster the American economy. Student impressions of the address were mostly positive.
“The speech was more than just rhetoric,” said Simon M. Thompson ’14, president of the Harvard Democrats. “It demonstrated that the President is committed to making our nation stronger.”
Brandon D. Moore, a second-year student at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it was exciting “to hear more of an emphasis on issues of poverty.” The President endorsed increasing the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, asserting that the measure would lift millions of Americans above the poverty line.
The President also stressed the importance of avoiding “the sequester,” a series of automatic budget cuts that will come into effect on March 1. Republicans and Democrats have yet to agree on how to avoid the cuts, which economists warn could send the economy back into recession. He also addressed the importance of education, pressing for universal, high-quality preschool education and lower costs at universities. He urged Congress to modify the Higher Education Act and use cost as a factor in determining federal aid to universities.
Not all students were wholly impressed with the speech.
Matthew J. Disler ’16 was concerned that the President was “trying to implement proposals that Republicans would not be able to get behind.” Although the speech focused predominantly on the economy, Disler said he felt that “gun violence and the Newtown shootings were the high points of the speech.” The President called for increased use of background checks, stating that gun control “deserves a vote” in Congress.
Many of the issues the President touched on in the speech, including gun control, have recently provoked partisan contention. The President’s remarks on the need for tax reform and the removal of loopholes for the wealthy, however, brought members of Congress from both parties to their feet.
The president’s pledge to sign a bill on comprehensive immigration reform also drew applause from across the aisle. To Thomas J. Gaudett ’14, it was encouraging to see the president “make policy proposals that could be attractive to both sides.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone told her players to “play with a chip on their shoulders” after a humbling defeat by No. 2 Boston College in the first round of the 35th Women’s Beanpot on Feb. 5.
On Tuesday night at Matthews Arena, after a full week off, the No. 5 Crimson team delivered and served a 3-0 shutout to No. 3 Boston University. The squad had a full week off after snowy weather forced the postponement of games.
“We did two things,” Stone said. “When we practiced, we practiced hard. When we rested, we rested. I think we had a great balance of both and so it ended up really shaking out like a typical week for us. We took the days off that we typically would take off. We took Saturday off, we went hard on Sunday and we were light yesterday so our kids had a lot of jump and I think you saw that tonight. We were flying.”
Harvard (18-3-2, 14-1-1 ECAC) topped the Terriers (18-4-2, 13-2-1 HE), a squad that has now dropped two consecutive games after a stretch of 12 wins and two ties, by outshooting its opponents 28 shots to 18 through the first two periods. This is the first time in program history that BU has finished fourth in the Beanpot.
The Crimson victory came at the hands of three forwards. After 23 scoreless minutes, junior Lyndsey Fry found the back of the Terriers’ net off assists by sophomores Samantha Reber and Sarah Edney. Fry’s quick shot evaded BU goaltender Kerrin Sperry and put up the first tally of the game.
Just 18 seconds leader, Reber followed up with a goal of her own, helped by sophomore forward Hillary Crowe who was waiting at the crease to fire off an assist to her teammate.
Reber returned the favor two minutes later. The center sent the puck to Crowe, who drilled it into the net to set Harvard up, 3-0, with 4:02 left in the second stanza. Reber finished the night with three points, tying her career-high for the fourth time.
“I feel good about [tying my career-high],” Reber said. “But again, it’s not existent without my teammates. They set me up and make beautiful plays in front of the net that allow us to go on those rushes and get great scoring opportunities. I was the one fortunate enough to be the one with the puck tonight in front of the net.”
While the Crimson may have sunk three goals in under three minutes, all was not always so promising for the team. The first frame saw the team fail to convert all four of its power play opportunities and yield a penalty of its own.
“I think the first period was a little bit just trying to figure it all out,” Stone said. “We had three different looks at the power play with one unit…then we went with what we call a BU power play. It’s an old men’s hockey BU power play and I think they actually ran the same thing in the third period. It just gave us better looks at the net and was more comfortable with two people at the point.”
Co-captain Jillian Dempsey entered the night just goal short of Harvard’s top ten all-time points leaders. While the forward contributed significant game minutes, she skated away from the contest having only made two shots, neither of which were successful.
“Jill did a lot of things off the puck tonight that made a big difference,” Stone said. “We had to put her at center in the third period a little bit and she did a great job for us there. She does all the little things. She may not appear on the score sheet but so many kids who make a significant impact often don’t.”
Crimson goaltender Emerence Maschmeyer made 32 saves, two short of her career-high which was set during last week’s loss to BC. She was particularly effective in the third period, racking up 14 of her saves during the frame.
“The third period is always a key period, especially when we’re up a few goals,” the freshman said. “For me, I have to focus on every shot one shot at a time and our team just had to keep confident throughout the third period.”
This was the second game in this year’s Beanpot during which a lower-ranked team has upset its opponent. On Feb. 5, unranked Northeastern downed the Terriers, 4-1.
“You can see where the ECAC hockey teams are coming up really strong this year,” Reber said. “It makes for a great tournament and it makes for great games all around, no matter what place you’re playing for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The third-ranked Harvard men’s squash team will have to wait another year to try its hand in a regular-season contest against No. 1 Trinity College. The Crimson (14-2, 5-1 Ivy) fell, 5-4, at the Murr Center on Tuesday night to the Bantams (15-0), a squad that until last year held a trail of 252 continuous wins, the longest known streak in collegiate varsity sports.
“I think the guys really stepped up tonight and I know that there’s going to be at least a couple that are absolutely gutted because we lost the match, 5-4,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “As a team, as a group of young men and as coaches, we’re pretty happy with where we are. There was a lot of maturity tonight. We needed to make some tactical adjustments and they made them. That’s why they were in the running.”
Victory was, however, found on the women’s side, as Harvard (12-1, 6-1 Ivy) simultaneously took down Yale (11-4, 4-3 Ivy). The match was previously scheduled to be played on Sunday afternoon but was rescheduled due to weather.
“You beat Yale and everyone’s happy,” Way said. “When it’s Harvard-Yale, it doesn’t matter what sport it is.”
HARVARD 7, YALE 2
In the culmination of its Ancient Eight season, the women’s team was able to sweep four of nine matches, 3-0.
“It was our last dual match of the season and our last home match,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said. “We were really looking forward to it, not just because of Harvard-Yale having a big rivalry but also with women’s squash. Our team in the past couple of years has developed a pretty big rivalry with the [Yale] women’s team. It was definitely a really good feeling beating them today. Everyone was excited.”
Mumanachit, who moved a step up the ladder to No. 6, was pushed to five games by her Bulldog opponent, Issey Norman-Ross. The senior fought back in the final set to beat Norman-Ross, 11-4, 11-3, 10-12, 10-12, 11-8.
“I was very impressed by Sarah getting the job done in five,” Way said. “She was up and then the other girl came back so that showed a lot of courage there.”
Sophomore Amanda Sobhy swept 2011 CSA Individual Champion Millie Tomlinson, 3-0, in 11-3, 11-4, 11-2 straight sets. Tomlinson fell three times in the regular season last year, all at the hands of Sobhy.
“Sobhy was just brilliant tonight,” Way said. “She showed her true colors and true strength.”
Freshmen Saumya Karki and Isabelle Dowling, along with co-captain Natasha Kingshott, were the other three Crimson players to blank their Yale foes, playing at the No. 4, No. 9 and No. 5 positions, respectively.
The Harvard squad will have just a short pause before it travels to New Haven for the CSA Team Championships.
“It’s made our jobs a lot easier to have such a great group of girls,” Mumanachit said. “We have a really good team dynamic this season. It’s definitely really sad that today was our last home match and that going into the weekend, it’s our last weekend. Four years goes by so quickly. It’s really amazing.”
TRINITY 5, HARVARD 4
Trinity jumped to an early lead against the Crimson, which found itself down, 3-0, at the end of the first wave. But all was not over for the Harvard team, which rallied during later rotations to eventually tie the match, 4-4.
Playing at No. 7, everything was on the line for senior Zeke Scherl. Bantam freshman Zeyad Elshorafy jumped to an advantage, taking the first two sets, 11-5, 11-7.
Scherl fought back in the third, coming to a 10-9 lead, but Elshorafy won the next three points to take the match for himself and his team.
At the top, the Crimson was able to handle its opponents. Playing at No. 2, junior Brandon McLaughlin battled with Juan Vargas in five sets. The two players swapped wins, 11-8, 9-11, 11-8, 7-11 until McLaughlin finally broke Vargas in the fifth, 11-9.
In the first slot, sophomore Ali Farag defeated senior Reinhold Hergeth in swift 3-0 sets, 11-4, 11-6, 11-5.
“Farag is the Merlin of the squash court,” Way said. “Ali plays at [No.1] and there’s always a little bit of magic happening. You’ve got to love him. He wasn’t severely tested tonight. His opponent was strong, but he’s not really in Ali’s caliber.”
Farag won the individual title last season after defeated then-defending champion Todd Harrity of Princeton.
“He’s got a big test coming up with national team championships and then individuals,“ Way said.
