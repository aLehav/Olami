After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EXETER, N.H.—Schools operate on a different schedule than the “real world.” From primary school through university, students live by the semester, these marathons interspersed with the confusing emptiness of break. If late August is the students’ New Years, then graduation is New Year’s Eve—a whirlwind celebration of past accomplishments and outsized resolutions for the future, which drags on through the hot days of summer until we are thrust back into the reality of the fall.
I am attending my younger brother’s high school graduation. Last year, I was sitting in his place, waiting to receive my diploma. Today, I’m reflected across the podium, seated in the crowd of family members packed on the school lawn.
There’s something bitter about seeing a younger sibling graduate but still not feeling like you’ve graduated yourself. Returning to high school has made me feel the stupidity and shame of victimhood all over again—as if the emotion itself were tied to the place. It wasn’t until I got to college that I realized how strange my high school was: The lack of discussion and training on sexual assault I experienced, despite living in a coed school of over a thousand students, is jarring.
The previous day, my sister and I hosted a meeting in one of the local coffee shops—probably where I finished editing my Common App. The topic of the meeting was sexual assault, and I was joined by current students and alumni. We talked policy: the way things are now, and what we want to see changed. The meeting was uplifting because I realized I was not alone. It was depressing for the same reason.
An upset in life usually implies a deviation from the comfort of one’s day-to-day existence. I imagine the word as some giant thorn, thrusting up in throbbing obscenity from an otherwise level field. The act that upset my life is of the opposite nature. It is a perpetual past that I live in, a day-to-day existence completely undisturbed.
We get mixed messages about the past in society. “Don’t let your past dictate your future,” we tell people. I’m spending the summer at a non-profit, and we meet people for whom that ought to be the case: people with offenses on their Criminal Offender Record Information records, refugees from other continents. But in practice, the world rarely operates in this manner. CORI reform only took effect two years ago, and we still live in a world where people are judged by their accents, their hometown, and their college degree. If you had to rely on cash assistance or food stamps, the assumption is that your parents didn’t work hard. If you attended boarding school, you’re probably a rich brat. You can’t escape your past, even if your past is just someone else’s generalization.
And then the other side of the coin: “Remember where you came from.” To me, the dictate suggests humility. Remembering your origins means that your ego can’t explode with the accomplishments of today. No one is an island (another tired aphorism), and by that logic, every successful person has an army of supporters behind her. Remembering that fact means honoring those people as well. To me, it recalls my school’s motto: Non Sibi, not for one’s self. You might have made it, but remember how you got there.
I sometimes worry that my obsession with sexual assault is just an example of my past dictating my future. I used to want to be a starving artist, to illustrate children’s books in hendecasyllabic Latin. The past year has shifted that: I instead want to work for a women’s non-profit. At least some things stay constant—in either case, I would be just above the poverty line.
But if I were to sit passively watching this injustice continue, wouldn’t that also be succumbing to my past in a different way? Returning to my high school reminded me of myself as 17, the confused girl too shy to come forward with an explicit accusation against my attacker. The incident has forced me to constantly remember—and constantly reflect on—my past, and what has brought me here today. Perhaps I should thank my rapist. Without him, I wouldn’t be in this position. Without him, I wouldn’t be motivated to give back to the other students in my situation—both the girls who attended my meeting, and the nameless ones who couldn’t.
The graduation exercises have ended, and the students trail off to their families. The class of 2014 has left. Boys and girls spend just four years at this school, and then turn into men and women who spend a lifetime giving back to it. I’ve become one of them, and I feel the anonymity of being one among very many. I’m not sure if what I say will make a difference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University Hall office that a systematic botanist occupied for the past year finally has a permanent inhabitant. Rakesh Khurana, Cabot House co-master and Business School professor, is officially the new dean of Harvard College.
Tuesday marked a changing of the guard at the top of the College administration, as Khurana assumed the deanship exactly a year after Evelynn M. Hammonds, who served in the role for five years, stepped down in the midst of scandal. Donald H. Pfister, a longtime botany professor, served as dean in the interim.
Khurana said in an interview Tuesday afternoon that he spent much of his first day on the job settling in. He met with the College staff and made sure his phone and email were up and running.
“I’m spending a lot of my time listening,” he said.
While an oversized stamp of botanist Asa Gray no longer sits on the dean’s office mantel, Khurana did decorate his new desk with photographs of his family and his late dissertation chair. It’s also now home to a wind-up toy robot, which he said reminds him to look to the future.
“There’s always getting used to the physical office, but I think...people have been incredibly warm and welcoming,” he added.
Named Pfister’s successor in January, Khurana will lead the College through a period of transition, as administrators navigate the most significant changes to its academic integrity policies in decades.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved in May a proposal for the College’s first-ever honor code—a policy that Khurana helped write—which is expected to be implemented by the fall of 2015.
The policy will dramatically alter the College’s existing disciplinary system, changing the jurisdiction of the Administrative Board, a body that was founded in the 19th century. As approved, the honor code will create a student-faculty judicial board, distinct from the Ad Board, to hear cases of academic dishonesty.
As dean and Ad Board chair, Khurana will likely play a large role in implementing the honor code over the next year.
Despite that upcoming change, Khurana comes to University Hall during a period of relative calm. Pfister devoted much of his year in the Dean’s Office to reaching out to students and colleagues to repair relations frayed during the scandal-ridden last year of Hammonds’s tenure.
