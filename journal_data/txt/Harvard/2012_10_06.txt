After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outside dorms, leaves are turning from green to red and Harvard students are turning from partiers to Lamonsters, which can mean only two things. One, midterms are here and campus-wide coffee sales are booming. Two, and more importantly, it is time for October baseball and the Fall Classic. For those Harvard students who have the time to delay hitting the books and want to hit the couch instead, here’s a Harvard-centric viewing guide for the Major League Baseball playoffs:
St. Louis Cardinals
Reasons to root for them:
The head of the Cardinals’ amateur scouting department is Dan Kantrovitz, who studied with Harvard statistics mastermind Carl Morris to transition from an amateur player to a statistics guru. Although no players Kantrovitz supervises will be on the field Friday, players like Yadier Molina and Allen Craig, whom he helped move through the organization’s ranks, will be instrumental if the team has any hope of success.
Reasons to root against them:
Besides the fact that they won it all last year—if you’ve taken Ec10, you know monopolies are never good—and have won 11 times overall, rooting for the Cardinals feels like rooting for the Yankees; you’re more likely to be rewarded with a championship but that championship won’t mean nearly as much.
Cincinnati Reds
Reasons to root for them:
Last year, Cincinnati drafted an Ivy League pitcher in the eleventh round who had sixteen strikeouts in his final college game and waved a teary goodbye to the Ancient Eight. Though the Ivy Leaguer is not on the postseason roster, you should still root for those teams who value intelligence over mere brawn.
Reasons to root against them:
Nolan Becker, the pitcher mentioned above who was drafted, went to Yale.
San Francisco Giants
Reasons to root for them:
You simply can’t resist rooting for a team whose two best offensive players are nicknamed “Bust-A pose” and “Kung Fu Panda.”
Reasons to root against them:
One of their players, Melky Cabrera, was caught this year using illegal substances and cheating the system. As a Harvard student, you have no tolerance for this kind of dishonesty.
Texas Rangers
Reasons to root for them:
As an international relations concentrator, you love the heterogeneity of a team that features Neftali Feliz, Adrian Beltre, Elvin Andrus, Koji Uehara, and Yu Darvish.
Reasons to root against them:
Because of your political affiliation with the Harvard Democrats, you ban yourself from supporting any team that George W. Bush owns a part of.
New York Yankees
Reasons to root for them:
New York is the closest of these towns to Harvard, and for your money, this may be your best chance to go watch a playoff game if you put up the cash to travel and get a seat.
Reasons to root against them:
Wherever you may be from now, living in Boston and telling someone your favorite team in the Yankees is a recipe for disaster that could only be worse if you told that same Bostonian that Larry Bird was a poor man’s Magic Johnson.
Washington Nationals
Reasons to root for them:
You see a bit of your overachieving self in Bryce Harper—a nineteen-year-old with a good chance of playing in the World Series before he exits his teens, who also received his high school diploma at 16.
Reasons to root against them:
You see a bit of your kid brother in Bryce Harper—a petulant child who breaks bats across his knees often and who was called cocky and immature by a manager within his own division.
Atlanta Braves
Reasons to root for them:
It’s Chipper Jones’ swan song in his final postseason for retirement and, as a student of history, you are endeared to the idea of a lasting legacy.
Reasons to root against them:
In their history, the Braves have fielded players from Dartmouth (Kyle Hendricks, drafted this year), Mark DeRosa (Penn), and Gene Larkin (Columbia), but never one from Harvard. Let the bitterness begin.
Oakland Athletics
Reasons to root for them:
You see the big-picture fairy tale story and look a bit closer at a club that relies entirely on numbers and gaming the system to get by. As either a business or statistics concentrator, you fall in love with Billy Beane’s way of doing business and his gutsy tale.
Reasons to root against them:
Like the Giants, they had a player banned for steroid use, and your moral compass steers you towards the other teams in the American League.
Detroit Tigers
Reasons to root for them:
You’re a history concentrator and knowing that the Tigers have the first pair of pitching-hitting Triple Crown teammates (Miguel Cabrera this year, Justin Verlander last year) in history simply gets your blood going.
Reasons to root against them:
You’re a statistics concentrator who, after reading Keith Law and Jonah Keri, sees the Triple Crown as a washed-up, Neanderthal way of measuring hitting ability and refuse to acknowledge any baseball fan who speaks in OPS and not wOBA.
Baltimore Orioles
Reasons to root for them:
You like the idea of seeing two prospects barely your age—Manny Machado and Dylan Bundy—being the key points of a team trying to make the World Series after losing at least ninety games in ten of the last twelve seasons.
Reasons to root against them:
As a statistics concentrator, you look at this team with a +7 run differential and note that it is worse than six teams who didn’t make the playoffs—including the team that finished right behind them in the standings, the Tampa Bay Rays. You also chalk up their 29-9 record in one-run games and 16 straight extra innings run as an annoying disruption to regression to the mean.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the third installment of a new weekly series, we break down the ins  and outs of the Harvard football team. This week, we dissect how  opposing quarterbacks have succeeded against the Crimson secondary.
Harvard suffocated the Holy Cross offense on Sept. 28, but the team will face a much more potent offense Saturday when junior quarterback Jeff Mathews, who won Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year as a sophomore, leads Cornell into town. For the Crimson to slow him down, it will have to play as well as it did against the Crusaders rather than reverting to the performance it had during the first two weeks, as Brown and San Diego both threw for over 325 yards against Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell junior Jeff Mathews was the quarterback who came into Saturday’s game at Harvard Stadium with all the accolades—he won the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year award as a sophomore, is considered likely to be the first Ivy quarterback drafted since Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, and he holds the Ancient Eight record for passing yards in a game.
But in the Harvard football team’s 45-13 win over the Big Red Saturday afternoon, it was the Crimson quarterback, senior Colton Chapple, who played like the star.
Chapple started the game 12-for-12 through the air, connecting with Andrew Berg for three touchdowns in the game’s first 16 minutes as Harvard took a quick 21-0 lead. He finished with 362 yards, four passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown as the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) won its 13th straight game, the longest winning streak in Division I.
“[Chapple] would get my vote for conference player of the year if we were voting today,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’ve had such a great lineage of QBs, but I don’t think anyone’s ever been a better decision maker and been a more poised football player.”
Junior wideouts Berg and Ricky Zorn had the best statistical games of their careers. Berg torched the Big Red (2-2, 1-1) all afternoon to the tune of 10 catches for 132 yards and the three scores—tying the Crimson all-time record for receiving touchdowns in a game—while Zorn registered five catches for 100 yards and a score.
“Cornell was playing a lot of young guys in their secondary,” Chapple said. “We knew that was something we could exploit.”
On the whole, it was a statement win for the Crimson, as the Big Red was expected to be one of two teams to challenge the defending Ivy League champions’ quest for a second straight title.
But on Saturday, Harvard showed why it is a heavy favorite to repeat, as the offense moved down the field with ease while its defense left Mathews uncomfortable in the pocket all afternoon. The senior completed under 50 percent of his passes in the contest, was sacked four times, and threw two costly second-half interceptions.
“If you’re going to have success against [Mathews], you’ve got to get him off his rythym,” Murphy said. “I thought our coaches did a great job changing things up and putting pressure on him consistently.”
The Crimson broke the game open early in the fourth quarter, when Zorn outleaped Cornell’s Kendall Brown at the goal line for a 24-yard touchdown reception, putting Harvard up, 31-13.
“In great games, coaches tell us all the time you have to make big plays, and bottom line Ricky made an unbelievable play,” Chapple said. “They covered us up pretty well, had a little bit of pressure, and I saw Ricky head toward the end zone, so I just gave him a shot.... I felt like that play kind of gave us some momentum and let us breathe a little bit.”
On the ensuing Cornell possession, Mathews threw the ball up for grabs on a third-and-two and junior Chris Splinter was able to easily intercept the pass, giving the Crimson possession at its own 45.
From there, Chapple rushed for 10 yards, senior running back Treavor Scales collected 14 yards on back-to-back carries, and Chapple hit junior tight end Cameron Brate for 10 more before Scales finished the drive with a six-yard run.
After a Cornell three-and-out gave the Crimson possession at its own 39, Chapple hit Berg along the right sideline for 24, and a Big Red personal foul added 15 more. On third-and-six from the Cornell 23, Chapple found the junior again for a gain of 19. After three straight plays that gained zero yards from the Big Red four, Murphy elected to go for it on fourth-and-goal and Chapple ran it in to put Harvard up, 45-13.
After a Big Red three-and-out gave Harvard the ball at its own 39, the Crimson once again took advantage. After Harvard marched down the field to the Cornell four, Murphy elected to go for it on fourth-and-goal, and Chapple ran it in to put Harvard up, 45-13.
Mathews was then intercepted by junior Jaron Wilson inside the Crimson red zone on Cornell’s ensuing drive to seal the Harvard win.
“Their secondary shut down of our receivers most of the game,” Big Red coach Kent Austin said. “They got physical on them, they were all over them, and they made more plays in the secondary than our receivers did, period.”
Another costly turnover hurt Cornell early on. After halfback Luke Hagy made a first down reception over the middle on the Big Red’s first drive, he was drilled by senior linebacker Josh Boyd and fumbled the ball, which Boyd recovered at the Cornell 39.
“Anytime you come out [for an] Ivy League game, you definitely want to set the tone early,” Boyd said. “It was definitely huge to provide that spark right off the bat.”
Harvard took quick advantage of the turnover. Following a 23-yard strike to Zorn on the Crimson’s first play from scrimmage, Chapple found Berg over the middle for a 17-yard score just 2:27 into the game.
After a three-and-out, Chapple led Harvard on an 68-yard scoring drive that ended with a nine-yard touchdown pass to Berg, who made a leaping grab over his defender off a lob pass.
On Harvard’s next possession, the quarterback orchestrated an 85-yard series that was capped by a 21-yard strike to senior Kyle Juszczyk and a 15-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Berg to put the Crimson up, 21-0, just 29 seconds into the second quarter. The score gave the Crimson touchdowns on 10 consecutive first-half drives dating back to the team’s previous game against Holy Cross.
“On a few of the touchdowns we didn’t get the defense that we liked,” Berg said. “Me and Colton [were] just on the same page.... We were able to get a lot of plays on coverages that didn’t necessarily play with us.”
Zorn dropped an easy pass on third down at the goal line and David Mothander missed a 30-yard field goal on the next Crimson possession, and Mathews took advantage by leading Cornell on an 80-yard drive capped by a three-yard touchdown pass to Luke Tasker. With 1:11 to go in the period, John Wells added a 25-yard field goal to cut the Harvard lead to 21-10 before the break.
But on its opening drive of the third quarter, the Crimson moved down the field with ease again. Scales had consecutive rushes of 17, 8, and 29 yards to bring the ball into Cornell territory, and the drive ended on a Mothander 20-yard field goal after a Chapple pass went off Brate’s fingertips in the endzone.
Scales finished the game with 106 yards on just 21 carries despite the absence of starting center Jack Holuba and starting right tackle Will Whitman, who had knee surgery yesterday and is out for the season.
“Our ability to run the ball in the second half really helped,” Murphy said. “It had a lot to do with keeping them off balance.”
That was something the Crimson would continue to do for the rest of the half, when it outscored Cornell, 24-3.
“I’m very, very proud of our football team,” Murphy said. “We’re probably running our offense as efficiently right now as we have in a long, long time.”
