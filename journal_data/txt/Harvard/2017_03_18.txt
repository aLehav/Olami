After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, I mentioned that ‘Big Little Lies’ seemed to be taking a detour from the traditional murder-mystery path. This week, though, it’s become apparent that the metaphorical car has actually come to a complete and total stop. “Living the Dream” sees the show give up almost all claim on the whodunit formula, setting aside any narrative momentum with regards to the central murder: There’s nothing about the victim’s identity, any potential suspects, hypothesized solutions, or anything else. If anything, the episode’s brief gestures towards the genre—the interrogations, the spokeswoman—become increasingly irritating and irrelevant tics. They hold no bearing on the actual drama of the show, which lies in interpersonal pain rather than murder.
This idea—that the show focuses on secrecy despite really being about expression—shows up in each main character over the course of the episode. “Living the Dream” finally reveals Jane’s big secret, but the scene’s emotional and aesthetic impact resonates through its affective precision rather than through any form of narrative suspense. We pretty much already knew that Jane was raped, but this week, we see Jane’s previously bland exterior crack into grim acceptance and wrenching rage. Shailene Woodley does good work here, allowing Jane’s submerged fury to push up against her general normalcy. After finding out that her son may have lost a beloved classroom toy, she shatters a banal silence with a transcendently brutal howl: “Why does this fuckin’ shit keep happening to me?” she shouts. Reese Witherspoon has her character mirror these breaks in response to Jane’s disclosure, allowing Madeline’s chipper, friendly exterior to give way to heavy empathy and pain. (After driving away from Jane’s house, she stops her gleaming car and lets out a genuinely moving sob.) Thoughtful film editing also serves to highlight Jane’s fracturing consciousness: Flashbacks and nightmares jolt in and out of the present, sometimes with no clear distinction between what happened, what’s happening, and what might happen.
Once again, though, the episode reaches new heights when it gets to Celeste and Perry. A lengthy scene depicts the couple during a counseling session, a stretch that recalls the acclaimed HBO series “In Treatment” in its focus on sheer acting prowess and simple human drama. Perry and Celeste struggle to explain to their counselor why they’re there, their tiniest movements betraying silent battles within themselves and between one another: Even as Celeste commits to the idea of normality, she looks at Perry with a sort of animal fear and denies physical abuse when the therapist asks her about it. While she flinches and cowers and tries (and then fails) to speak, though, Perry defies all expectations by sitting steady. Totally at home, he admits to violence and offers a set of ready explanations—he loves her too much, he’s afraid of losing her. “There’s a line between passion and rage, and sometimes, I don’t know, maybe we cross that,” he says. He has a powerful mythology for what’s happening, a mythology that romanticizes the violence and justifies his actions. Meanwhile, Celeste seems caught between his story’s allure and her instincts as to its wrongness. As a whole, then, the scene continues the show’s powerfully nuanced thinking on domestic violence. It takes the conventional wisdom about gas-lighting and outright deceptive abusers and suggests a more complex narrative, a world in which deception can be attractive, subtle, and directed inward on both sides.
For all the high-level emotional drama, ‘Big Little Lies’ still continues to have some clunky moments. Madeline’s plotline feels fairly static, and the show lacks clear direction in the new absence of the mystery structure. “Living the Dream” also tries to add depth to Laura Dern’s Renata Klein, but without much success: The hyper career mom who really just needs to get properly laid feels like a cliché too stale for anyone to reanimate. That is, at least for now—we’re only three episodes in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Americans,” an FX original series that details the exploits of two KGB deep cover agents living in the nation’s capital during the height of the Cold War, might just be the most important show on television right now. At a time when reputable newspapers are inching ever closer to proving that the current president owes some sort of allegiance to Russia’s current KGB agent-cum-president-cum-dictator Vladimir Putin, the account of Soviet spies living in a D.C. neighborhood becomes rife with political tension.
In that light, what a season it promises to be. Season Five rejoins our protagonists at a crucial moment in their time as spies: Their major operation of the previous season—ferrying dangerous biological threats from a fellow Soviet embedded in the U.S. biological weapons research program back to the U.S.S.R. for study—has failed in spectacular fashion. Their man on the inside, William (Dylan Baker), infects himself with a deadly virus to avoid being interrogated and dies in quarantine. With their contact discovered, the couple faced a difficult question at the end of Season Four: Is it time to return to Russia?
The first episode of season five offers a clear response: Hell no. Philip (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth (Keri Russell) Jennings continue their work in D.C. The couple spends the premiere ingratiating themselves to a Soviet defector working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. There’s also considerable drama in their home, as daughter Paige (Holly Taylor) struggles with the knowledge that her parents aren’t the American travel agents they’ve always said they are, while navigating a new relationship with the son of neighbor—and ranking F.B.I. agent—Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich).
The first four seasons have been some of the best television on air over the last few years; despite a strangely directed fourth season finale, the sheer quality of acting and production value poured into the show has resulted in a truly special product. That said, episode one of this newest season fell victim to one of the show’s few flaws: It’s slow. The last five or so minutes of the show are comprised of an almost dialogue-free sequence of the Jennings and their fellow undercover agents digging a hole behind the facility William worked at. The payoff is interesting enough that I won’t spoil it here, but the sense of mystery when they start digging quickly fades to annoyance once it becomes clear that they don’t plan to tell us what’s going on.
Joe Weisberg, former C.I.A. officer and creator/producer of “The Americans,” has earned my trust with four mostly incredible seasons of television. It must be said, however, that this was not the triumphant return to the small screen that could be hoped for, perhaps even expected, from the show. It almost feels like the episode belongs somewhere in the middle of the season, where its contemplative slowness might have served as a welcome return to methodical spying after a series of high-intensity, action-packed sequences. But, of course, it’s not; it’s the premiere of the second to last season in the show, and I hate to say it, but it might be the slowest premiere the show’s had yet. I fully expect the show to pick up again, just as it’s done in the past—all the seeds are there, laid by the previous seasons and primed to grow after the premiere.

As many undergraduates headed off to the beach for the College's spring break, a blizzard hit Harvard's campus.  The University and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were closed on Tuesday, March 14, due to the 12 to 18 inches of snow in the forecast. However, the snowstorm ended up being a bit more mild than predicted, with less than a foot of snow hitting Boston and Cambridge. Crimson photographers captured scenes from the storm and its chilly aftermath.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 17, 2017, at 10:06 p.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — After Harvard’s ECAC semifinals clash with Quinnipiac, Sean Malone’s choice of postgame attire was all too fitting.
Upon emerging from the back of the press room, the senior center made his way to the podium donning the Crimson’s signature piece of headwear—the tradition-laden player of the game hat. Presumably because hat tricks aren’t called hat tricks for nothing.
With the Bobcats fighting to keep their season alive at Herb Brooks Arena on Friday, Malone netted three goals in a game for the first time in his career, lifting top-seeded Harvard to its 13th straight victory and a spot in its third consecutive conference championship game.
“You need your best players to step up, and I think we’ve seen that,” said senior Luke Esposito, Malone’s linemate. “We needed a spark, and the greatest part of our team is it can come from any player. Tonight it was Sean pretty clearly.”
Through three postseason contests, Malone now has a staggering nine points—the same output he had over the entire month of February. The Buffalo Sabres prospect has also scored in all three games against Quinnipiac (23-15-2, 13-8-1 ECAC) this season.
“It feels good to do it in a big game like this,” said Malone about the hat trick. “More importantly, I’m just happy we got the win and [I'm] looking forward to tomorrow.”
On the two-month anniversary of the Crimson’s most recent defeat, Harvard utilized Malone’s three-goal outburst to build a 3-1 edge over the defending tournament champions. The No. 2 Crimson (25-5-2, 16-4-2) then added an empty-netter with 2:05 remaining to close the book on a 4-1 victory.
The scoreline matches that of last season’s championship game, in which Quinnipiac—also the second-best team in the land at that point in time—disposed of Harvard to capture the program’s first Whitelaw Cup.
Of course, these Bobcats aren’t those Bobcats. Despite being picked to finish first in both the media and coaches’ polls at the start of the season, Quinnipiac finished fifth in the conference and had to squeeze out a series on the road at St. Lawrence in order to even make it back to Lake Placid.
But for the Crimson, that hardly mattered.
“We were determined from the beginning to get them back for last year,” Esposito said. “I thought it was a good game both ways, and it was nice way to finish a four-year rivalry with those guys.”
“We’ve had some battles with them the last three years here,” added Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I think in some ways our seniors feel like you really can’t win the ECAC unless you play Quinnipiac along the line.”
The Crimson dominated puck possession essentially throughout, outshooting the Bobcats by a 28-11 margin through the first two periods. Yet, it wasn’t until sophomore fourth-liner Michael Floodstrand laid a hit on Bo Pieper in the Quinnipiac zone midway through the middle frame that Harvard broke a scoreless stalemate.
Floodstrand’s hit jarred the puck loose along the right boards, enabling him to seize possession and feed Malone by the right faceoff dot, where the senior moved in and ripped a wrister past goaltender Andrew Shortridge at 11:00.
The Quinnipiac offense just didn’t get enough going to keep up with Malone’s pace on Friday, but the Bobcats did manage one equalizer thanks to a Jake Horton hooking penalty at 15:13. Quinnipiac’s only shot on goal over the course of its three power plays—a bad-angle attempt from Thomas Aldworth at the bottom of the left faceoff circle—trickled through the pads of Merrick Madsen with 3:44 to go in the second.
But less than a minute later, Harvard jumped onto a power play of its own. And while the Crimson technically failed to convert, Malone punched in his second goal of the evening eight seconds after the penalty’s expiration. With Shortridge unable to corral freshman Nathan Krusko’s shot from the outer edge of the left circle, Malone knocked in the rebound from below the opposite circle.
There would be no more equalizers. Malone put the finishing touch on his hat trick with some nifty stickwork in front of goal 4:04 into the final frame, doubling Harvard’s lead to 3-1. And with 15 saves in the period, Madsen did his part to preserve the advantage.
“Harvard’s the most talented team in the country,” Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold said. “They had the puck a lot...and then I think when we had the puck, we played with just a little bit—not a lot—of panic in our game. We needed to possess it and work their D down low. We talked about it all week long; we just didn’t do a really great job of it.”
Pecknold did try pulling out a few tricks to generate an offensive push late in the game, removing his goaltender on a Bobcat power play with all of 7:46 remaining in regulation and then again on a 4-on-4 with a little more than three minutes to go. But ultimately, the only goal-scorer down the stretch would be Esposito, who hit the vacant cage with just 2:05 left.
Friday represents all she wrote for the Bobcats, who—ranked 21st in the PairWise—will not be able to obtain an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Meanwhile, Harvard will play for a Whitelaw Cup here Saturday night against Cornell.
GAME NOTES
—Harvard finished 0-for-4 on the power play, while Quinnipiac finished 1-for-3.
—Quinnipiac's Connor Clifton unleashed what looked like an elbow to the head of Harvard senior Tyler Moy in the final minute of the second period, giving the Crimson a power-play opportunity in what was then a 2-1 game. Many people in the building anticipated Clifton receiving a five-minute major, prompting parallels to last year's championship game when a five-minute boarding penalty against Luke Esposito led to three Quinnipiac power-play goals. But after a review, the officials decided to give Clifton just two minutes in the box.
—Cornell advanced to the championship game with a 4-1 win over Union in Friday's semifinals nightcap.
—Harvard defenseman Adam Fox was recognized as the ECAC Rookie of the Year prior to puck drop. Fox, along with co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, were also named First-Team All-ECAC.
