After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overdue conversations about race made their way to most corners of America this summer, prompted by George Floyd’s killing and the powder keg of injustices prior. This moment prompted our editorial board — alongside so many other organizations — to critically review our history, stances, and current practices. Why do we look the way we do and opine the way we have? How does our work relate to racial justice?
In June, we outlined a series of five editorials exploring how Harvard can help fight anti-black racism. The first three of these laid out concrete actions we wish the University would take to help usher in a more just future, including divesting from private prisons and abolishing our own private police force. But in this, the final installation in our staff editorial series, we’re turning inward to share the product of three intense meetings over the last few weeks, during which we thought about how we could reform our own practices.
And while this editorial marks the final installment in our racial justice series, we hope its commitments move us toward a more comprehensive, empathetic, and transparent approach to social responsibility — the start of a more rigorous dedication to listening, learning, and improving that extends beyond any of our individual tenures.
Our board is small and only imperfectly representative of the Harvard community. Though we’ve diversified vastly since our 1911 origins, we remain bound by the voices of those in our meetings. Whether we opine on an issue or not, and the approach we take to doing so, is inevitably a reflection of our board’s membership and their respective perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences.
Yet our voice is sometimes seen as a stand-in for that of students broadly and our platform allows us to loudly and effectively champion causes. Both our impact — like citations in University decisions and national publications — and our mistakes suggest that our community deserves a board that is receptive to the breadth of perspectives on our campus as well as transparent about who we are. To aid us in our continuous effort to bring more of the community into our writing process, we are setting out four first steps.
First, we will be opening a “suggestion box” for criticisms, questions, and just about anything else. Starting in September, it will allow for both named and anonymous submissions and be accessible at the bottom of our staff editorials and on the opinion page landing page. While we will continue to accept letters to the editor at editorial@thecrimson.com, we hope this new feature will make it easier for you to tell us what you think about our work and what you hope to see us cover.
Second, we will more frequently reach out to campus groups as we prepare to opine on topics that touch on their particular needs, identities, and causes. These live conversations with campus groups — structured as Q&As at the start of our meetings — help us come to more informed and thoughtful decisions. Our peers often have insight on issues we simply don’t, and when we’re opining on issues we don’t have a hand in, we want to hear them out. If your organization would like to sit with us for one of these conversations (or would like to see us opine on a certain issue), do not hesitate to reach out.
Third, during our upcoming recruitment campaigns we will emphasize that the Editorial Board is a space for dissent and disagreement, with a leaning as malleable as our membership. Every staff editorial is decided by vote, and new membership can and does change our stances. Moreover, our best content often comes in the form of strongly worded and often prescient dissents. We hope to encourage those who have disagreed with our opinions in the past, or who have felt that The Crimson was not for them to join the board, bringing their fresh ideas and views with them.
And, starting in September, we will publish a list of the current active editors on the Editorial Board, directly accessible via our website. While we take pride in our institutional byline, we believe it’s important that our community can hold us accountable for what we publish.
For ourselves and for the community we hope to serve, we still have questions to answer. About how to foster space for disagreement and diversity of thought and about what our own editorial voice can do to combat injustice. Please never hesitate to reach out to us with questions or concerns. However you wish to engage — writing an op-ed, submitting feedback or a letter to the editor, or joining our team — we need your voice.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a marathon meeting Thursday night, the Cambridge School Committee approved a proposal for remote-only learning for most Cambridge Public School students in grades 4-12, allowing preschool through third-grade families to opt for some in-person learning.
The plan — which was approved unanimously by the committee during the nearly seven hour meeting — is contingent upon eight items discussed Thursday, including a testing plan, ongoing evaluations of key coronavirus metrics, and the adoption of engineering guidelines to ensure that school spaces are ventilated properly.
The plan allows preschool through third-grade students to opt for in-person learning four days per week. There will be limited in-person capacity for second and third-graders.
Before committee members deliberated the plan, many educators and Cambridge families expressed their concern about students returning, even partially, to in-person learning at the meeting.
The School Committee was also considering hybrid and in-person reopening plans as of mid-July. Members of two Cambridge groups, the Cambridge Educators of Color Coalition and Cambridge Families of Color Coalition, advocated an all-remote start to the school year. Many argued a hybrid or in-person plan would pose undue health risks for students and school staff of color.
“Given all the unknowns in the current plan, starting the year remote is the only way to resume school safely,” CFCC member Emanuel Antunes said at the meeting. “A rushed decision is a bad decision, because one death is too many.”
School Committee member David J. Weinstein said that any option for learning did not pose a clear “right answer.”
“There are many times in education where there’s no one right answer. This is the case here to a much, much greater degree than usual,” he said in an interview.
The committee also reserved the right to change course any point.
School Committee member Rachel B. Weinstein said she thinks “the most likely occurrence” is that the school goes all-remote at some point during the academic year.
“I hope they have the opportunity to [be in person], especially in September and October when it’s nice enough out to get to know their teachers and their peers outside,” Weinstein said.
But, she added, “I think there’s a good chance that, even if it’s not in September, at some point this year, we’re going to be all-remote.”
The current plan allows for an in-person option for “families whose students have specialized needs,” including students in some special education and English immersion programs.
All families will have the option of remote learning for their students.
“The only scholars who would be in-person are ones who have opted in, and there are guidelines as to who has that option to opt in,” Weinstein said. “But no family or child is being told, ‘you have to be in person.’”
The school will open in stages, with students returning on September 16 for half-days and to full-day instruction by October 5.
“I can tell you that after the vote happened, I broke down a little bit, for a couple of seconds,” committee member José Luis Rojas Villarreal said in an interview. “It was not an easy decision. It’s a big load on everybody’s shoulders.”
“At the meeting, we were saying that it’s not fair that the federal government and that the state is not giving districts guidance,” he said. “But that’s it — that’s where we are, so we need to make decisions. It weighed really heavily on everybody’s shoulders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Planning Board voted Tuesday to recommend an affordable housing overlay zoning petition to the Cambridge City Council.
The overlay — a key issue in the last election cycle — will allow affordable housing developers to compete with market rates by streamlining the permitting process for units that are deemed 100 percent affordable.
The Planning Board voted 7-to-1 in favor of recommending the overlay to the City Council. The overlay will need to be presented to the entire City Council before it can be officially passed.
Councilor and former Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, a strong proponent of the overlay, said while it is yet to be seen whether the overlay will be officially adopted, he is “very excited” about its prospect.
“I really hope that this leads to better integration of our neighborhoods by allowing more affordable housing to be built in areas that are currently lacking in affordable housing,” McGovern said.
McGovern sponsored the proposal to re-introduce the overlay along with Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, and Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. after the initial proposal was dropped in 2019.
In his statement Tuesday evening in front of the Planning Board, McGovern referred to a redlining map of Cambridge that showcased the areas of the city where banks had denied mortgages in the 1930s to people of color and lower-income residents of certain neighborhoods.
“When we look at where our affordable housing is located today, it is almost a perfect match to our redlining map,” McGovern said. “This, of course, is not the fault of anyone here tonight and is not the fault of anyone who resides in those neighborhoods, but we have a chance now to help rectify that injustice, by making it easier to build affordable housing in areas where it currently doesn’t exist.”
Allan E. Sadun, co-chair of affordable housing advocacy group A Better Cambridge, wrote in an emailed statement that while his organization is pleased with the board’s decision, he hopes to see more follow-up measures enacted, such as stronger tenant protections and the elimination of parking minimums.
“Cambridge's housing problems go beyond a shortage of affordable housing - we have a shortage of all kinds of housing, plus a displacement crisis coming up whenever Governor Baker's eviction moratorium expires,” Sadun wrote.
Cambridge resident and former City Councilor David E. Sullivan said he was “delighted by the vote” and believes that the overlay has “a very strong likelihood” of being passed by the City Council.
“Six members of the City Council have made it very clear that they support this, and the overlay needs six votes out of the nine members of the City Council for it to pass,” Sullivan said.
If passed by the City Council, Sullivan said he believes the affordable housing overlay will “ensure that every neighborhood of our city is open to people of all races and all incomes.”
“We need more housing of all kinds in our city, but we especially need housing for low- and moderate-income people,” Sullivan said. “They are being priced out of our city, and this is an important way, not the only way, but an important way to get more housing.”
“I think it is a matter of not only economic justice but also social justice,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Science Foundation named Chemistry and Chemical Biology Professor Emily P. Balskus one of two recipients of the 2020 Alan T. Waterman Award earlier this month.
The Waterman Award recognizes researchers under age 40 “who demonstrate exceptional individual achievements in scientific or engineering research in NSF-supported fields,” according to the NSF. Awardees each receive 1 million dollars to support research in their field.
Balskus — whose research focuses on the chemical underpinnings of microbial biology — is the first female scientist from Harvard, and one of six Harvard scientists in total, who have received the Waterman Award since its inception in 1975. In an interview, she described her work as an exploration of “how nature makes molecules.”
“I was trained, you might say very classically, in organic chemistry as a graduate student,” Balskus said. “Somewhere along the way in grad school, I got very interested in understanding how microbes made natural products.”
“I like to think about the chemistry occurring in nature and recognize reactions that synthetic chemists can't easily do in a lab, from which we can see opportunities that exist in nature for us to make molecules in a more efficient or sustainable way,” she added.
In one recent project, Balskus and her team found that the bacterial-produced toxin colibactin causes DNA damage, which may contribute to colorectal cancer. The finding’s potential applications in medicine made the project especially rewarding, she said.
“I think it's really neat that we as humans are really a collective of organisms, and we've sort of been ignoring a huge part of ourselves,” Balskus said. “One way I hope that our work will impact medicine is that I think we and others in the field have really started to gain some evidence that it may be possible to treat or prevent human disease by actually targeting the microbiome with small molecule drugs.”
NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a press release that Balskus and this year’s other awardee — John O. Dabiri, a California Institute of Technology aeronautical engineer — are “innovators who are creatively addressing some of the most challenging scientific questions.”
“Emily Balskus has opened up novel ways to explore and exploit the chemistry and biology of microbes that live in our bodies and how they are linked to our health,” Panchanathan said. “And we’re already seeing the potential impact.”
Catherine L. Drennan, a professor at MIT and one of Balskus’s collaborators, said Balskus brings a “very curious and enthusiastic” approach to research.
“To me, that is one of the very best things that a scientist can be,” Drennan said. “Because when you're asking good questions, you're really going after understanding things and you're not caught up with your own personal ego and your own personal theories.”
Drennan also described Balskus as a “card-carrying organic chemist” within the field of biology who “seamlessly combines the two disciplines.”
“It's just chemical biology done in the most beautiful way, and there are few people who do it as well as she does,” Drennan said. “She's just incredibly smart, but she's also a very kind and generous collaborator, and so she's able to put together a team of amazing scientists and raise up everyone's science all around her.”
Eric N. Jacobsen, a Harvard Chemistry and Chemical Biology Professor and Balskus’s former research advisor, said Balskus has been “serious, fearless, and eager to venture into new areas” since her time as a graduate student in his lab. He added that, in her role as a professor, she is “a wonderful departmental citizen.”
“She is an inspired and dedicated teacher and mentor, working tirelessly in support of our undergraduate and graduate students,” Jacobsen wrote in an emailed statement.
“What can I say? I feel very proud and lucky to have her as a colleague,” Jacobsen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A July report from the Cambridge Police Department revealed that the department owns several assault rifles and an armored vehicle.
The department released a report cataloging all of its “materials, tools, and property” on July 27 in response to a June policy order passed by the Cambridge City Council requesting a list of all departmental equipment.
Among the inventory are 63 Colt M4 rifles, 11 sniper rifles, 18 MP5 submachine guns, and one Lenco Bearcat — a $350,000 armored vehicle. In a statement to the city, Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said that while these weapons are used “sparingly,” they are necessary to protect Cambridge from violent shootings.
“It is not so much a matter of ‘it could happen here’ — it does happen here,” Bard Jr. wrote, referencing a July 2 incident when an individual fired an automatic weapon on Harvard Street. “At first blush it may sound harsh, but as a general rule you cannot allow your police department to be overpowered.”
“As a parent, I do not want to send my child to a school where, God forbid, that if something terrible happened, local law enforcement could not overcome the threat and adequately protect children from further unnecessary harm and terror,” Bard added.
Upon the release of the report, city officials and residents took to social media to express their dismay with the numerous military weapons in CPD’s inventory.
City Councilor Marc C. McGovern described the list of weapons as “disturbing” on Twitter.
“I admit that there may be good explanations for some but this list is excessive,” McGovern tweeted.
U.S. Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) wrote on Twitter, “Weapons of war have no place in our communities. Demilitarize the police.”
Cambridge resident and former U.S. Army infantry officer Loren Crowe tweeted that while deployed in Afghanistan, he used the same Colt M4 rifle that CPD holds in its inventory.
“What are they getting ready for? What do they think of the city they're hired to police? Are we that much of a threat?” Crowe asked.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement Friday that some of these rifles are used by the Special Response Team for dignitary security, protective details at major events, and for barricaded suspects.
“All of the firearms and rifles possessed by the department are able to be legally purchased and lawfully-owned by private citizens,” Warnick wrote. “The last time rifles were purchased by the department was in 2017.”
Councilors Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and Quinton Y. Zondervan — the sponsors of the policy order requesting a list of CPD’s inventory — said in an interview that many questions remain unanswered about these items.
“There’s a lot in the inventory report that we need to dig into,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said Friday. “The question of response and public safety is one we are going to have to wrestle with.”
Sobrinho-Wheeler said law enforcement officers often work together at the local, state, and federal levels to respond to serious incidents, thus local departments do not necessarily need weapons for every possible threat.
“When we talk about being overpowered, about a terrorist incident, about the uses of force, we shouldn’t think of Cambridge responding to these things in isolation,” he said. “Other response teams at the state and at the federal level get called in, and so we should really be focused on what kind of public safety we want to have in Cambridge.”
Zondervan said discussions about CPD’s possession of military weapons will continue with a meeting between the Public Safety Committee and the department.
“I look forward to having that conversation with the police commissioner and understanding the rationale for why they need these weapons, and then we can reach some resolution on getting rid of the ones that we truly don’t need,” Zondervan said.
“I don’t think we need any of them, but that’s a conversation we need to have,” he added.
