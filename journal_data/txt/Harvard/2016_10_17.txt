After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the new NBC series “Timeless,” brilliant history professor Lucy Preston (Abigail Spencer) is recruited by the government to use her world-renowned knowledge of contemporary United States history to stop the mysterious time-terrorist Garcia Flynn (Goran Visnjic) from wreaking havoc in the past. His target: Preventing the Hindenburg disaster? At least for the first half, the show has you rooting for a cast of unlikely heroes who hope to ensure a historical tragedy that resulted in the deaths of 36 people. [Eventually, however, Flynn’s true motives are revealed—sort of—as he does actually intend to blow up the Hindenburg, but on its voyage back to Europe with influential historical figures, one of his targets being John D. Rockefeller Jr., a key figure in the development of the League of Nations.
Professor Preston is joined by the soldier with a soft side, Master Sergeant Wyatt Logan (Matt Lanter)—who at the first sign of danger completely disregards all protocols, beginning with the warning not to commit homicide using modern day technology—and the geeky IT guy, Rufus Carlin (Malcolm Barrett), who understandably expresses unease, as an African American, at the thought of traveling back to 1937. The unlikely trio work well together in driving the narrative forward.
Although the show may fall for classic time-traveling clichés such as the narrative-saving principle that time travelers can’t travel slightly further back in time to fix any potential mistakes of their own, the tongue-in-cheek humor shines through. Although there are no fewer than three dick jokes dropped in the first three minutes of the pilot episode, including a snide comment by a female reporter in 1937 on the Hindenburg’s size as “compensating for something,” the humor comes into its own with Rufus’s commentary on race relations in 1937. From the uncomfortable glances of the inhabitants of 1937 New Jersey directed at Rufus while the group is searching for their prime suspect to subtle remarks about how the back of the bus was better than he expected, the character provides witty insight to emphasize how much the black experience has evolved in the United States.
“Timeless” asks the viewer to suspend disbelief throughout the episode, ignoring things like the United States government’s almost comedic inability to discover a time machine capable of “bending the space time continuum to create a time loop” or the science behind the time travel and the ramifications that the slightest impact may have on alternate futures. The biggest leap in logic occurs in the alterations of the time stream. Despite warnings against interacting with the past, as the consequences could be potentially catastrophic, our trio of heroes throw that mantra out the window the moment they step out of their time capsule.
Yet despite the monumental changes they make to the timeline, once they return to the present day, they seemingly find little difference in this new alternate timeline, other than some convenient plot twist in one of the characters’ main storylines, thus propelling them to continue the saga in the next week’s installment: Lincoln’s assassination. Overall the show does not change the formula of the time travel genre, but it does succeed at not taking itself too seriously when considering interesting historical what ifs coupled with snarky comedy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For pre-orientation one year ago, I chose the First-Year Urban Program—a whirlwind week of social justice in both debate and practice. We lived with no air conditioning, donated breakfast in garbage bags, and sandwiches with only one piece of ham. At night, we debated all the intricacies of privilege, BGLTQ rights, feminism, and police brutality.
While this social justice thing was completely new to me, it was also the only part of Harvard where I felt like I fit in. As a lower-middle class, Chinese-American woman, I was not made for Harvard. But in the social justice community, I found others who shared my experiences, my story, and my values—a group of “others” that became a lifeline I held on to tightly.
First semester of freshman year, I volunteered for the Phillips Brooks House Association, took Professor Matthew Desmond’s class on poverty in America, read Upworthy articles religiously, and even cried over a debate on assimilation. I objected more than a few times when someone talked about BGLTQ issues or sexual assault without a “representative” in the room. I cringed when “African-American” and “Black” were used incorrectly. I established myself as an authority on all things Asian.
I embraced these exacting habits because FUP wasn’t just the first time I learned about social justice—it was the first time I felt validated, heard, honest, and powerful. It was the first time I realized I have a right to be myself, a right to be passionate, a right to demand change. But I also quickly discovered that the social justice community isn’t perfect.
To claim a place in this “accepting” community, I had to think perfectly, talk perfectly, act perfectly, live perfectly. There was no room for unintended marginalization, for career considerations that paid too high, for ignorance towards the ever-expanding set of causes that the social justice movement adopts. As much as I want to sympathize, too much of it is unacceptably exclusive.
Instead of focusing on the very real “bigots” of this world and tackling head-on the political structures of inequality, the loudest voices of the movement have become preoccupied with witch-hunting for “fake liberals.” There is this strange conviction that only the most extreme versions of a position can be true, and that all minor deviations, all attempts to compromise or to even consider the other side are forms of bigotry.
The result of this extremity is a tendency to prioritize flashiness over truth. It means that if, as a woman, you suggest that being careful with clothing, especially when walking by yourself, is a good way to reduce the risk of sexual assault, you will be immediately caricatured as blaming women for rape. It means that if you talk about the higher SAT and GPA scores needed for Asian-Americans in college applications in a debate about affirmative action, you will be immediately shut down as trying to pit minorities against each other.
Using exaggeration and shame to deny the tension of real nuances is both ignorant and irresponsible. No issue that deals with thousands of people can be so crudely simplified. And if my unwillingness to support these exaggerations earns me the ultimate disqualifier of “center-left,” that is the identity I want to embrace. Because this active polarization is more than a Harvard drama—it is a denial of humanity to the rest of this country.
As someone who comes from a lower-middle class neighborhood of moderate conservatives, I can’t support this criminalization of conservatism. I not only know but also have friends who are Trump supporters. I hate the misogynistic and racist elements of the modern Republican Party, but the “angry white men” who have been deserted by their manufacturing jobs are the past owners of foreclosed houses in my city. These are people who can barely afford to get by, let alone have the time to concern themselves with social justice. And to believe that this world can move forward in hatred of these people is a mistake.
Social justice does not justify exclusion. And acceptance cannot involve putting someone’s politics above their humanity. We cannot truly claim to embrace diversity when we expect everyone on the inside to look the same. People like me may not be “perfect” by your standards of social justice, but as a “real” liberal, I am also trying to make this world a better place.
And I am not your enemy.

Election Day, or “the Tuesday immediately after the first Monday in November,” is a big deal. Across the country, eligible voters have the chance to go to the polls and fulfill their civic duty to their country. If you’re voting here in Massachusetts, your ballot allows you to vote for the county sheriff or approve the measure to legalize marijuana (Question 4 ballot initiative).
So what is the cost of a vote?
There’s the obvious opportunity cost of taking the time out of your day to stand in line at your polling place. If you live in a place like Florida or Arizona, the lines might be long. If you’re voting absentee in another state, there’s the cost of a stamp and one or two trips to the mailbox. If you’re voting in one of the 31 states that have voter identification requirements, you deal with the added complication of determining what counts as an appropriate ID and obtaining it if you don’t already have one.
No matter where you vote, you must invest time in researching the candidates, and likely also suffer through campaign calls and television advertisements.
Votes ultimately decide elections. As Michelle Obama recently pointed out, Barack Obama only won New Hampshire in 2012 by 66 votes per precinct. In Mississippi last year, two candidates for the state House of Representatives got the same number of votes; the winner was decided by a coin toss.
If you’re unhappy with your choices at the top of the ticket, consider that things might be different if more than a measly 28.5 percent of all estimated eligible voters from both parties had voted in the primary. And consider how falling voter turnout has impacted the trajectory of our country: turnout rates fell to 57.5 percent in 2012 from 62.3 percent in 2008.
But cost of a vote is bigger than just the numbers. There is inherent value in voting, and a moral price we pay when we do not.
When colonial America decided to go to war to establish its independence, we did so because we believed that the cost of living in a society where citizens were taxed without representation was a violation of the sacred contract between the government and the governed.
Our collective conviction to secure voting rights did not stop there. United States history is littered with tales of sacrifice in the name of procuring a stronger civic voice for future generations. The cost of this sacrifice was high: 618,222 men died in the Civil War, seven suffragists went on a hunger strike, and more than 50 nonviolent protestors were beaten and hospitalized in Selma. Can we morally afford to disrespect those sacrifices by deliberately staying home on Election Day?
For 228 years, U.S. presidential elections have yielded peaceful transitions of power between administrations. But the only thing holding our democratic institutions together, ensuring a stable government that works for every citizen, is our right to vote. It is what separates our country from those whose leaders have torn apart democratic legitimacy through accusations of “rigged elections” and mass disenfranchisement.
On principle, voting matters because it has to matter. Your vote counts because it has to count. It is the only way we can stand by our convictions, fight for the betterment of our country, and build a better future. We vote to affirm the value of democracy, which yes, is a very big deal.
Voting doesn’t just matter during presidential election years—every office on the ballot is important. We cannot allow frustration with Washington or the presidential nominees to keep us from being civically engaged. We cannot allow electoral map predictions to keep us from voting for our next city councilor, state senator, or governor.
If you’re angry about how our country has been run for the past four or eight years, ask yourself where you were on Nov. 6, 2012. Then ask where you’ll be on Nov. 8, 2016 to do something about it. And if you value the leadership demonstrated over the last eight years, remember President Obama’s proud proclamation: “our progress is on the ballot.”
Don’t waste this opportunity. Request your absentee ballot today (the deadline is closer than you think!) Figure out what all of your candidates stand for, and please make sure your grandparents have transportation to the polls. If you’re voting in person, don’t forget to put going to the polls on your calendar.
Ultimately, our country cannot afford the cost of not voting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s recent initiative to provide a stipend to its president and vice president has the potential to alleviate a financial impediment to two of the College’s most demanding extracurricular positions. The measure, which received the support of all but two UC members, one of whom abstained from the vote, offers a $1,000 stipend to future UC presidents and vice presidents if they receive financial aid from the College, or $1,500 if they are in the “high financial aid bracket” and pay between zero and 10 percent of tuition. This pilot program’s funding will be drawn from an unused $6,000 of last academic year’s Student Activities Fees, which are term-billed to all students.
This initiative’s aim to make the UC’s presidency and vice presidency financially accessible to all is unequivocally commendable. As its proponents have argued, the measure allows all students to run for these positions without having to balance leadership of the UC with need for part-time employment. Hopefully, this program will increase the socioeconomic diversity of UC presidential and vice presidential candidates, leading to greater representation of the student body in the College’s undergraduate leadership. We believe that financial aid initiatives such as this are instrumental in emulating the College’s socioeconomic diversity within its extracurricular organizations, and we support the UC’s pursuit of this goal.
Nevertheless, we must also side with the measure’s sole dissident in raising questions about the initiative's funding. While the program has the potential to be positive, we strongly encourage the UC to find an alternate source of funding. Students who pay $75 for student activities, which the College allocates to the UC, should rightfully expect their money to be devoted to this cause. The UC’s failure to fully utilize these funds last year should be remedied by earmarking them for student activities this year, no matter how worthy alternatives such as this financial aid initiative may be.
Furthermore, the measure’s funding is as unsustainable as it is questionable, as the $6,000 earmarked for this plan can only subsidize two to three years of UC leadership if the holders of both positions receive the funding. The UC should not intend to withhold future Student Activities funding when its existing resources for this program have been spent, emphasizing the need to fund this program from elsewhere to pursue the initiative’s admirable aspirations.
We understand that the UC requires funding to function, as it is, after all, a student activity. The UC may well determine that it wants to subsidize other demanding extracurricular positions on campus, but until it passes a measure to that effect, there is no reason why it should use students’ and families’ money to make an exception for itself.

The story of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump’s political rise dominated a conversation with CNN President Jeffrey A. Zucker ’86 Friday afternoon at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
Moderator Lois Romano, a political correspondent for The Washington Post, began the event by discussing Trump, whom she called “the elephant in the room.” She prompted Zucker to address CNN’s role during the election by questioning the network’s decision to devote significant air time to Trump.
Zucker, a former president of The Crimson, remained adamant that CNN was not responsible for Trump’s nomination as the Republican candidate.
“In his defense and in our defense, when we asked him for an interview, he said yes, and I cannot say that about the other Republicans who were running for president,” Zucker said. “That’s not Donald Trump’s fault, that’s not CNN’s fault.”
He instead praised CNN’s ability to “recognize much earlier than most that there was a bit of a phenomenon to Donald Trump.” As a result, the network gave Trump more coverage during his earlier rallies.
However, Zucker did say that CNN’s choice to devote significant air time to Trump’s earlier rallies may have been a mistake.
“If we made a mistake last year, it’s that we did put on too many of his campaign rallies in the earlier months. You never knew what he was going to say, so there was an attraction in letting it run,” he said.
Before his time at CNN, when Zucker served as the president of NBC Entertainment he greenlit “The Apprentice” and worked directly with Trump.
“The Donald Trump I’ve always known is somebody who’s a publicity magnet, someone who knows how to use the media. He loved to brag about his ratings, and he knew how to draw attention to himself,” Zucker said.
Zucker denied having any insight into a recently unearthed video from 2005 of Trump, featuring the Republican nominee making lewd comments about women.
“I would say what is out there now, I’m unaware of any of that,” he said. “That was certainly not in the context of the way I knew him.”
Attendee Betty Pu viewed Zucker as being overly “defensive of CNN.”
Another attendee, Chandler Beyer admired Zucker’s insistence in abstaining from endorsing one of the candidates.
“I really appreciated how he stayed firm on not saying what political candidate he supported,” Beyer said. “I think that really is imperative to staying as unbiased as possible.”
Zucker also outlined the ways in which he believes he has changed CNN’s trajectory for the better as CNN Worldwide president. The three strategies he outlined were “going all in” on the big news stories, creating original series for CNN’s television channel, and investing in the development of its digital platform to grow its millennial viewer base.
“There’s no doubt that traditional news organizations have wanted to chase millennials,” he said. “We are the number one source of news information of any digital platform in the world.”
During the conversation, Romano brought up a previous comment Zucker made about Buzzfeed, another popular digital platform, in which he called Buzzfeed not a “legitimate news organization.” She pointed out that he recently hired their political investigatory research team.
“I said they weren’t a real news organization—they are a real news organization,” he said.
Before joining CNN as its president in 2013, Zucker spent 25 years at NBC Universal, where he served as the Entertainment President from 2000 to 2004 before becoming the CEO in 2007.
When an audience member asked Zucker to look back at how his time at Harvard shaped where he is now, Zucker said being the former president of The Crimson gave him a “tremendous foundation for journalism.”

Leaders of Harvard’s renewed “Living Laboratory” initiative, designed to engage students and faculty in sustainability efforts, say the program reflects growing interest in environmental action on campus.
The core idea of the Living Laboratory initiative, which will be housed in the Office for Sustainability, is to use the Harvard campus as a test bed for new ideas related to combating climate change and improving public health.
While the original Living Laboratory initiative, which offers student grants, will remain in place, two additional projects have been announced as part of the revitalized program: the Climate Solutions Living Lab Course and Research Project, and a new $200,000 Campus Sustainability Innovation Fund.
According to Heather A. Henriksen, the director of the Office for Sustainability, the introduction of the new plan reflects a trend of increasing interest in sustainability among Harvard students.
“I've been here since 2008. In the last eight years I definitely have seen an increase in interest from students as well as faculty and senior administrators at the University to do more to translate our research into practical problem-solving,” she said.
The Climate Solutions Living Lab Course and Research Project, led by Law School clinical professor Wendy B. Jacobs, will launch in spring 2017. The interdisciplinary course will discuss various approaches to reducing greenhouse emissions at Harvard and beyond.
“The object of the course is for the students to do some real life problem solving about climate change,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs also talked about the importance of collaboration and a multidisciplinary approach in the course.
“The class is specifically designed to bring together faculty and students across campus,” she said.
The aim of the new Campus Sustainability Innovation Fund is to spur new sustainability research  projects, and will be made available to undergraduate, graduate students, and post-doctoral students at the University.
The fund has already caught the attention of post-doctoral fellow Piers O. MacNaughton, who, after taking advantage of grant money from the Office of Sustainability in the past, has already applied for funding for some new research projects.
MacNaughton lauded the initiative as providing a new funding source for students.
“When I started at the masters program four years ago, they didn't have these types of grants for students,” he said. “Typically, you don't have the opportunity to pitch a project like we’ve been able to. That in and of itself is unique.”
Although not yet in full swing, Henriksen is optimistic about the Living Laboratory's new offerings.
“I am very hopeful that, driven by faculty and student interest, we will do more and more from Living Laboratories,” she said.

Current and prospective students, activists, and legal experts explored how legal strategy and international human rights advocacy influences indigenous rights in the U.S. at Harvard Law School’s Indigenous Rights Movement conference last week.
Kristen A. Carpenter, an Oneida Indian Nation Visiting Professor of Law at HLS, said the conference sought to give students access to conversations on federal Indian law, a subject for which Harvard has no permanent professor.
“It seems important to really do a lot of programming when we’re lucky enough to be here teaching for a short time, and really make an impact on the community and the students’ educational opportunities, as well as to note particularly what’s going on in the present moment of advocacy around American Indian issues,” Carpenter said.
Carpenter co-chaired the event with Robert T. Anderson, another Oneida Indian Nation Visiting Professor of Law; Angela R. Riley, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles; and Lorie M. Graham, law professor at Suffolk University Law School.
The conference’s programming focused on several issues in current indigenous rights advocacy, including indigenous peoples’ government institutions and how they fit in the U.S. constitutional framework.
“Some of the signal features in this particular moment include… a real revitalization of tribes’ own institutions of government, their culture, their economies, and the ways in which federal Indian law is being shaped by, and advancing, with the benefit of tribal and international advocacy,” Carpenter said.
The conference also served as a recruitment opportunity for a number of prospective Law School students. The Harvard University Native American Program provided partial or full sponsorship for students to attend the conference through an application process.
Kyle Ranieri, a student at Yale College who attended through HUNAP’s program, said he appreciated the opportunity for students to explore both Law School admissions and specific curriculum interests.
“We’re interested in learning more about Harvard Law School and what they have to offer generally as a law program, but also more specifically in terms of their Indian law offerings,” Ranieri said.
Sean Massa, a student at Yale Divinity School, said he was particularly interested in the aspects of the conference that discussed international perspectives on indigenous rights.
“For me, I’ve been particularly interested in how indigenous peoples kind of negotiate and advocate within international forums,” Massa said.
Carpenter said student involvement, including remarks from the co-presidents of the Law School’s Native American Law Students Association, was central to the conference’s success.
“While we have a lot of very famous leaders in Indian country here, we are also pretty deeply inspired by the students and their future,” Carpenter said.

Chester Finn, co-founder of the charity Community Empowerment Programs, talked about overcoming the judgments of others through self-advocacy at Harvard Law School on Friday.
Finn currently works with Michael A. Stein, executive director of the Law School's Project on Disability, developing storytelling projects so that people with disabilities can talk about how they make their own choices and where they fit in the world.
According to Finn, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to the National Council on Disability, being visually impaired did not stop him from seeking work and social opportunities.
“Sometimes you have to go against what people say, and when it’s about your race and your freedom, you should go above that and do what’s necessary for yourself,” Finn said.
After having been rejected from a job as a cashier because of his disability, Finn said he filed a complaint with the New York Department of Human Rights and eventually won the hearing for his case.
“I can deal with a lot of the things, but the one thing I can’t deal with is when people tell you that you can’t do something because of your disability,” Finn said. “How would they know? They’re not me.”
Finn said the greatest advice he has to offer is to watch how people treat those around them and observe their actions, which he believes oftentimes reflect how they will treat you.
“You can experience things, you can see things, you can observe things sometimes without going through them,” Finn said.
Recounting his personal story, Finn said that, at the end of the day, there will be people who judge others based on their physical characteristics or even the perceptions of those around them.
“It’s what’s inside of us that’s more important,” Finn said.
Stein lauded the work Finn has done as a self-advocate while introducing Finn.
“In all those places, Chester has lent his wisdom, his smarts, his savvy to programming and work,” Stein said.
Alice Osman, a student at the Law School, said she enjoyed listening to Finn’s personal narrative.
“He was so engaging,” Osman said. “I was also impressed at how he was able to use his sense of humor well to tackle a sensitive topic and make people more aware of disability rights.”

Mushrooms overtook the Harvard Museum of Natural History on Saturday afternoon as students of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 54: “Biology of the Fungi” hosted the course's third Fungus Fair, bringing in a troupe of visitors, students, and eukaryotes.
The event, which attracted around 200 visitors, featured booths manned by students in the class around the museum. After choosing a topic related to fungi, each student set up a presentation to teach attendees what they had learned.
“We often say that the way that one learns—really learns—a topic is to teach about it. So they all have topics that they’re teaching about,” said course instructor Donald H. Pfister, a professor of systematic botany.
Topics ranged from “What do fungi have to do with your electricity bill?” to “How do fungi travel?: Fungi hitchhikers.” Many of the booths were interactive, featuring various samples of local fungi from Cambridge.
Despite recent weather conditions, the class was able to amass a large assortment of fungi.
“It’s been quite dry, so we’re lucky we could go out and find this vast array of fungi to show people,” Pfister said.
Paul Cervantes ’19, who presented on how fungi interact with coal deposits, said he and his classmates went to Estabrook Woods in Concord, Mass., to collect samples.
“Getting large samples of fungi that look like fungi was challenging,” he said.
Cervantes added that another challenge was making the topic “less boring.” Because many of the topics involved scientific jargon and required some prior background knowledge, students strove to make their presentations accessible to the public.
“It’s not the most sexy topic,” Cervantes said.
In addition to taking care of logistical details for the event, the museum's staff advised students on how to communicate their work to visitors.
“I think museums help serve as a bridge between Harvard and the public,” said Wendy Derjue-Holzer, the director of education at the Museum.
Evan M.J. Liu ’18 said he saw the event as a unique opportunity to raise interest in science among the general public. Liu’s booth involved a quiz that matched visitors with different types of fungi based on their personality.
“I like how it exercises a very different part of science. I think part of science is reaching out to the community, getting it interested in this stuff,” he said.
Attendee Zijay Tang, a graduate student at MIT’s School of Bioengineering whose current work is related to fungi, said he was very glad to see an event centered exclusively around fungi.
“I couldn’t find anyone in the MIT community that does fungal stuff,” he said. “I wanted to come here for some inspiration.”
Pfister, who was the interim dean of Harvard College from 2013 to 2014, is well known among students for his passion for fungi.
“[The students] are all engaged,” Pfister said. “I’m always very proud of them for the effort they’ve put into this activity.”

Diana K. Nguyen ’15 shared her research on the decades-long history of activism for ethnic studies at Harvard with a group of undergraduates and alumni on Thursday at a “teach-in.” that was co-sponsored by Concilio Latino, Native Americans at Harvard College, and the Task Force for Asian and Pacific American Studies.
Several dozen attendees, including new Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, gathered in the Ethnicity, Migration, Rights space at 4 Arrow Street for the event.
Nguyen, who completed a secondary in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights and was on the committee’s student advisory council, said she combed through old Crimson articles to find mentions of ethnic studies. She said that going forward, she would like to cross-reference information from the articles to get a more complete picture of the historic push for the discipline.
“This is something I’m really dedicated to and interested in,” she said in an interview.
While an undergraduate, Nguyen also interned with the EMR committee and was involved with Asian American activism. She is now a program coordinator with the committee, but she emphasized that she was speaking from her role as an alumni, not as an administrator at the teach-in.
Nguyen said that, over the course of her time at Harvard, it has been exciting to see progress such as the creation of a Latino studies secondary and the formation of working groups in ethnic studies.
“I definitely think [there has been change]. Maybe unsatisfyingly so for a lot of people,” she said. “But I saw a lot of dedicated faculty and administration that really wanted to support the students.”
Fellow alumnus Alex L. Chen ’16 also attended the event. He  was involved with the creation of the Task Force on Asian American and Pacific Studies and also received an EMR secondary.
Chen said he was disappointed with the lack of Asian American studies courses available to him as an undergraduate.
“I hope in the longer term that this history [of ethnic studies at Harvard] inspires or reassures people that what we’re interested in isn’t anomalous,” he said. “This has been around for a long time.”
The use of teach-ins as a form of activism is not new on campus. The Task Force on Asian American and Pacific Studies hosted several last semester, and Nguyen found an article during her research about a teach-in for ethnic studies during the 1980s.
“A lecture is boring. A teach-in sounds more communal—you do it together,” Nguyen said.  “I want people to participate and feel like they’re a stakeholder in the knowledge.”
Concilio Latino treasurer Ruben E. Reyes Jr. ’19, a Crimson editorial writer, said he felt the event was an important contribution to the institutional memory of ethnic studies.
“When a freshman comes on campus, and they see this part of their academic sphere is missing, they might assume they’re the first to notice it,” he said.
Reyes said knowing the history of the push for ethnic studies is also important when looking ahead to further activism.
“It’s good to know where we’ve been and what’s worked and what hasn’t,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council will provide Costco sandwiches to undergraduates later this week, after a proposal from the Student Relations Committee passed during the Council’s Sunday meeting.
The legislation, sponsored by Student Relations Committee Chair Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, allocates $1,100 to fund a College-wide “healthy study break.”
“There have been a lot of complaints from students about food and not being well-fed throughout the week,” Sachee said, referring to an ongoing strike by Harvard University Dining Services workers that began around two weeks ago. “We want to do our bit.”
The UC voted 45-3 earlier this month to endorse the HUDS workers in their intent to strike. UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 met with University Director of Employee and Labor Relations Paul R. Curran last week to discuss students’ concerns about the strike.
Representatives from Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, a student group that supports the HUDS strike, presented before the Council earlier this month preceding the endorsement vote.
Originally, the study break legislation drew funding from the Student Relations Committee budget, the Freshman Class Committee budget, and the Council’s $10,000 Emergency Fund. However, representatives overwhelmingly voted in favor of an amendment proposed by Education Committee Vice Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 to use the Emergency Fund alone.
Sachee said she hoped platters of sandwiches would be made available one evening this week in each House’s dining hall and in Annenberg.
The legislation passed with just one abstention.
Also at the meeting Sunday, the Rules Committee stirred a contentious debate with a proposal, sponsored by Rules Committee Chair Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, to establish formal caucuses on the Council.
The policy, a vote on which was delayed until next week, would have amended the Council’s bylaws to allow “racial, cultural, ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, or gender identity group[s]” of three or more representatives to be recognized as a formal caucus with the power to release statements and endorse legislation.
“Caucuses are not simply to advocate for the identities that we hold, but they are to keep us in check and keep us in touch with these communities,” Dudley House representative Laila M. Smith ’18 said.
The Council currently has several informal caucuses—including the BGLTQ caucus, the black caucus, and the Latinx caucus—but none are official institutions of the UC.
Several representatives, however, raised objections to the legislation. UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 objected to the proposal’s exclusion of first-generation students and low-income students from being a group that could apply to be a caucus.
Greenlaw instead proposed an amendment to allow “any otherwise under-represented groups” to be eligible for caucus recognition.
Though the amendment passed, others still had objections to the policy. Kirkland House representative Diana Im ’17 argued that requiring three representatives to be a member of a group to become a caucus could leave out particularly under-represented groups if they don’t have three members on the Council.
Banks also objected to the legislation, arguing that the current system, in which caucuses exist but aren’t formally recognized under the Council’s bylaws, was sufficient.
“I think what this [legislation] does is that it makes it harder for any group to form a caucus on the Undergraduate Council,” Banks said. “We have caucuses right now. Institutionalizing it doesn't do anything to change that.”
Ultimately, the Council voted to table the legislation and will consider the proposal again next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens gathered over the weekend in Cambridge to mourn the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.
King Bhumibol, whose reign lasted for 70 years until he died this past Thursday, was born at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge while his father studied public health at Harvard.
Local memorials took place at the King Bhumibol Adulyadej Square, which commemorates the king’s connection with the University and sits between the Kennedy School and the Charles Hotel.
Dozens of mourners came to the square from Thursday through Saturday to pay their respects, bearing bouquets and handwritten notes. A circle of candles and flowers around a small monument in the square has expanded each day.
A larger memorial service took place at the square on Sunday afternoon. The event was organized by Wat Nawamintararachutis, a Thai Buddhist temple located south of Boston.
Monks from the temple, dressed in orange robes, were present at the ceremony, as were dozens of attendees. Multiple speakers addressed the audience and led prayers. At the end of the service, people joined hands for a singing of the royal anthem of Thailand.
University affiliates from Thailand also mourned King Bhumibol’s death this weekend. Many said the king, who some viewed as a fatherly figure, left behind a legacy of uniting the Thai people.
Anupong “Mee” Tangpeerachaikul, a graduate student in chemistry, said King Bhumibol strived to understand the lives and needs of the Thai populace.
“Wherever he goes, he sees the problems and brings solutions,” Tangpeerachaikul said.
Jasmine Chia ’18, co-president of the Harvard Thai Society, said that King Bhumibol’s birth and experiences in the United States may have been partially responsible for his ability to understand his people.
“He grew up as a commoner. He wasn’t treated like a royal figure in Cambridge,” Chia said. “He did not grow up expecting to be king. It made him someone who was really relatable.”
A sign held up at the memorial captured many of these sentiments.
“I may not have come from the greatest country,” it read, “but I am very proud to say I have lived in the country with the greatest King.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in the first of three consecutive weekend away games against Ivy league opponents, the Harvard women’s soccer team found itself locked in a tight battle with Brown on Saturday afternoon in Providence, R.I. Though the Crimson (7-3-3, 2-0-2 Ivy) held a considerable advantage in both possession and shots, it trailed, 1-0, for the majority of the contest after the Bears (7-2-4, 2-1-1) scored an early goal.
In the 89th minute, with the team’s seven game unbeaten streak on the verge of being snapped, Harvard earned a free kick near midfield and poured all of its players into the box in search of the equalizing goal. The long ball first found senior forward Midge Purce at the left edge of the box, and she redirected it with her head toward the face of goal. There, fellow senior attacker Rachel Garcia struck a forceful header into the top left of the net.
With all of the momentum on its side, the Crimson continued to push forward in both periods of overtime, but the Brown defense held to preserve a draw. With the result, Harvard maintained its second place standing in the conference, one point ahead of the third-place Bears. Brown, meanwhile, earned a point to follow its impressive road victory last weekend at Princeton.
“Brown is having a pretty good year, so we knew they were going to be an organized team,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “I think we played quite well. The goal that they scored was against the run of play, but they’re part of the game. We were obviously creating a lot of chances and I was proud of the way that we came back into the game.”
The Bears’ opening goal came in the 27th minute, when junior forward Mikela Waldman put the team ahead after a scramble in the box. Crimson defenders cleared the ball almost immediately after it crossed the goal line, and the referees deemed it a score for Brown.
From that point on, Harvard remained goalless for the majority of the game despite maintaining a relentless attack on goal. The Crimson held a 19-0 advantage in corner kicks, but the Bears, led by sophomore goalie Christine Etzel’s 14 saves, managed to ward off the Harvard shots.
“We continued to chip away and created a lot of chances,” Hamblin said, “But their goalkeeper had a really strong game.
The Crimson nearly equalized in the 70th minute, but senior midfielder Carly Rotatori’s header hit off the post and went out of bounds. Harvard also had several more shots in the following minutes, but Etzel managed to save these attempts.
In the overtime periods, the frustration from earlier in the game continued, as the Crimson outshot the Bears 5-0 but were unable to score the goal it needed to secure three points.
“We played a good game, but unfortunately, we were scored on in the first half and could not respond for most of the game,”  junior defender Marie Becker said. “We were 19-0 on corners and we outshot them. It’s the sort of game we could have won but didn’t, and that’s just how soccer goes sometimes.”
With the final result, Harvard moves to 28-20-4 in the all time series against Brown. It now has three games remaining in the season, all crucial to its chances of winning the Ivy league.
“The mindset is that we absolutely need to win those games,” Becker said. “Right now, Columbia has lost no points, and we’ve lost four. The Ivy league is a place where going 7-0 is unlikely, but we can’t count on them to lose many points. We need to win the next game and if we do that we will be in the best place we can be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five goals and two broken records complimented the Harvard field hockey team’s 5-0 victory over Cornell on Saturday, as the Crimson extended its winning streak to six games—the team’s longest such streak since 1990.
One more victory now would give Harvard (8-4, 4-0 Ivy) its longest winning streak in program history. But on Saturday, individual records—not team records—were the ones to fall. With two goals and an assist on Saturday, senior forward Marissa Balleza now stands alone atop Harvard’s all time point and goal lists with 103 and 44, respectively.
Nonetheless, it took a bit for Balleza and the Crimson to get rolling at the Berylson Family Field Hockey Field. Harvard struggled to score at the outset of the game, as it was not until the 28th minute that the ball finally made its way past the Cornell defense and into the goal. Following a penalty corner, senior back Sophie van Weede smacked a shot at the goal that was blocked, then rebounded and scored by captain Kyla Cordrey for her first goal of the season.
“We had to grow into the game,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “Cornell came out to compete with us and we had difficulty finding our rhythm, but once we got the first goal, it allowed us to grow some confidence. As soon as that happened, we were able to control the game a little bit better and therefore get some more goals.”
The scoreless first 27 minutes were not the result of few shots at the goal, as both the Crimson and the Big Red (6-7, 1-3) posted four shots and two penalty corners apiece prior to Harvard drawing first blood. Rather, it was a testament to two strong defenses. Cornell’s junior goalie, Kelly Johnson, had a goals against average of 1.69 prior to the matchup, ranking 20th in the nation, and a .712 save percentage to go along with it.
Harvard’s defense, however, touts a strong goalie of its own. Saturday’s matchup marked sophomore Libby Manela’s sixth start and the team's subsequent sixth consecutive victory. Undefeated in net, Manela has allowed only three goals since being inserted into the starting lineup. As a result of her efforts, the sophomore has been given two Ivy League Field Hockey Player of the Week awards.
Manela would not concede a goal on Saturday—her second straight shutout—but the Crimson still managed to give her a little insurance. Just before the half, in the 35th minute, junior Emily Ott doubled the Harvard lead with her first goal of the season.
Then just 17 seconds out of the half, Harvard struck again. This time it was Balleza, scoring the 43rd goal of her career to tie Judy Collins ’99 on the program leaderboard. This second goal within less than a minute of playing time increased the lead to 3-0.
A foul by the Big Red in the 52nd minute granted Balleza a penalty stroke, an opportunity she capitalized on, extending the Crimson lead to four. With her second goal of the game and 10th of the season, she passed Collins for the all time program record in both goals and points.
The final goal came in the 57th minute as Hannah Wellington dribbled through the circle and backhanded the ball into the goal for her third score of the season.
“I think we were smarter in the circle yesterday and really took advantage of the chances we did have by making good decisions,” junior midfielder Ellie Cookson said. “We also weren’t afraid to just take the shot when the opportunity arose which is something we have struggled with in previous games.”
Harvard beat Cornell in attempts at the goal, with 11 shots to the Big Red’s seven. Overall, Cornell racked up one more save than the Crimson with four.
Harvard’s six-game streak will be tested next weekend when Harvard squares off against conference rival and No. 11 ranked Princeton (9-5, 4-0). The Tigers, the only other undefeated Ivy League team remaining, will host the Crimson at Bedford Field on Oct. 22; and with primarily conference games remaining, the result will likely be for the Ivy League crown.
“The team knows that we will have to [start stronger] if we want to compete with a team like Princeton,” Herwaarden said. “I think the tone in next week’s game is going to a whole different beast. We’re going to just prepare for it the whole week, we’re going to do what we do. We said at the beginning that we’re going take it game by game, and so far, that is working very well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since its only loss of the season on Oct. 1, the Harvard women’s rugby team (5-1, 3-1 Ivy League) has scored 149 points. As a comparison, its opponents in those same two games have mustered up five points against the Crimson defense.
This weekend, Harvard’s unlucky opponent was Cornell (3-1, 2-1), as the Crimson went on to defeat the Big Red 91-0 in Cambridge this Saturday afternoon.
Harvard came out rolling on all cylinders as sophomore Genevieve Quirion scored the team’s first try of the match. From that point on, the Crimson never looked back, as the score piled up to 53-0 by the end of the first half.
“It’s really important for our team mentality and the way we want to play [to score first],” freshman Emily Prentice said. “We want to come out on our front foot and play aggressively and it’s a good way to set the tone on the way the rest of the game is going to go and it’s proved itself on Saturday that we were successful in our games.”
Prentice led Harvard with four tries on the game, recording a natural hat trick with three straight in the first half. She also contributed multiple assists in the tries of a few other teammates throughout the game.
The freshmen class had a strong showing in the contest, as first year Delia Hellander put it multiple tries of her own, setting a career-high of three scores. Sophomore Caitlin Weigel had a day of her own, as she scored for the sixth consecutive game.  As the Crimson continued to add to its lead, its offense was able to expand, opening up the opportunity for different players to see the pitch and a greater variety of players to be run.
“We were able to get a lot of our newer girls onto the pitch and people were playing in different positions that they haven’t played in years in some cases,” Weigel said. “Scoring helps us try new things, which can only be beneficial in the long run.”
When all was said and done, eight different Harvard players contributed to the scoring effort including freshman Dominique Cantave, sophomore Rahcel Harkvay, junior Taci Periera, and senior Claire Collins.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Crimson was able to record its second shut out of the season, with the first coming on Sept. 17th against the University of New England. With Harvard’s defense holding its opponents to an average of 7.7 points per game, both sides of the ball have contributed to the team’s dominance among Ivy League play.
“Shutting out teams is a huge testament to the work we’ve put in on the defensive side,” Weigel said. “Defense is so hard, you’re constantly running and constantly talking and being able to post a shut out is a testament to how hard we’ve been working.”
Saturday’s win closed out the regular season for the Crimson, concluding the best fall the program has ever seen. Harvard now stands at the second tier in Ivy League standings, second only to undefeated Dartmouth.  And with the playoffs looming in two weeks, the Crimson is hoping to avenge its lone loss in the postseason.
“After the Dartmouth game we really knew we could play better and our potential was so much higher and being able to take that mentality back to practice and see our hard work pay off these past two games has been really rewarding,” Prentice said. “[Going into the postseason] we want to build on top of our momentum and solidify the structure we’ve been playing in. We’re going to have a big defensive emphasis and play off of the team’s we’re playing and using our strength on offense to be able to capitalize on that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Racing in multiple timezones over the course of two days, the Harvard cross country women and men separated to race in the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational, the 2016 Pre-National Invitational, hosted by Indiana State, and the Princeton Invitational. Led by senior Brandon Price and junior Courtney Smith, both the women and men’s teams performed well against tough competition.
WISCONSIN INVITATIONAL
At the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational,  junior Courtney Smith was the Crimson’s top finisher for the third race this season, placing an impressive sixth out of over 200 runners hailing from 17 of the top 30 schools in latest USTFCCCA National Coaches' Poll. Running in the Championship race of the Wisconsin Invitational on the Thomas Zimmer Championship Cross Country Course for her third year in a row, Smith recorded her best 6k finish in this race with a time of  20:09.2.
“Wisconsin is one of our most competitive meets of the season. We face top- ranked teams from all over the country,” Smith said. “It's a neat race with a lot of people on a course that was designed specifically for cross country as opposed to a golf course being used for the race.”
Also finishing in the top 100, freshmen Lisa Tertsch and Erin Dietz continued to shine in their debut season for Harvard. Tertsch finished in 57th place with a time of 21:01.8 and Dietz in 82nd with a time of 21:14.9.
The other scoring finishers in the Championship race were  junior Elianna Shwayder in 103rd and freshman Judy Pendergast who finished 109th in 21:32.0.  The Crimson also had several runners competing in the open race earlier that morning.
“It was really great to be able to compete with some of the fastest teams and runners in the nation and good preparation for the upcoming championship part of the season,” Smith said.
PRE-NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
In a different part of the Midwest, many Harvard men competed in the 2016 Pre-National Invitational, hosted by Indiana State at the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course in Terre Haute, Indiana.
Sixty-three men’s teams competed on the 8K course that will also serve as the site of the NCAA National Championships on November 19. Though was unable to place in the top half of teams, finishing 35th against the deep field of top Division I teams, Price was the top Ivy League finisher.
“Personally, I had a good race.  The conditions made it tough, but I was able to stay relaxed and finish with a race that I could be proud of,” Price said. “I was the top Ivy League runner which is a great step towards our next race.”
Located on a reclaimed coal mine, the course conditions were challenging and the extreme humidity made breathing difficult causing quite a few runners to faint.
Out of a deep field of over 260 finishers, sophomore Kieran Tuntivate came in 138th with a time of 25:31.1. Freshman Will Battershill finished close behind him in 146th, crossing the finish in 25:36.8. Also scoring for the Crimson were junior Gabe Montague with a 26:35.3 finish and freshman Kaeo Kruse with a time of 27:22.9.
PRINCETON INVITATIONAL
Closer to home, Harvard also sent six men to the Princeton Invitational at the West Windsor Fields where this year's Ivy League Heptagonal Championships will take place. Led by sophomore Collin Price, the Crimson finished 18th overall against Ivy rivals Columbia, Penn, Princeton, and Yale as well as other top ranked teams. Both C. Price and fellow sophomore Nick Linder ran their fastest collegiate 8K finishes, finishing in  25:17.4 and 25:31.0 respectively.
Harvard is off next weekend before both men and women head to Princeton to compete in the 2016 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships on October 29th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team extended its unbeaten streak to six games and remained atop of the Ivy League after claiming a 1-0 victory at Brown (6-5-1, 1-1-1 Ivy) this Friday. The victory marks the third consecutive season in which the Crimson (7-3-2, 2-0-1) has opened up Ancient Eight play by going undefeated in its first three conference games.
“We played with alot of heart, a lot of passion and alot of fight.” captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “It was effort that won us the game...we went out there and battled for 90 minutes and got the result.”
After a scoreless first half that saw Harvard dominate the Bears with a 5-2 advantage in shots as well as relentless pressing, junior midfielder Eric Gylling scored the only goal of the game off of a set piece. Classmate Christian Sady swung a cross into the box off of a free kick, where it was met by Gylling to slot it past Brown goalkeeper Erik Hanson.
The goal was the Sacramento, Calif. native’s first goal of his collegiate career and marked the 10th Harvard player to score a goal. Sady picked up his team leading fifth assist of the season, tied for second in the conference.
“The balance that we’ve developed and had over the last few game allows us to be unpredictable, it doesn’t let the opposing team focus on any guys or shut a few guys down...those goals and assists can come from anywhere.” senior forward Jake Freeman said.
It was all Brown early on, as the Bears forced Crimson junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks into two saves within the first six minutes of play as the Harvard backline struggled to assert itself early on. Unlike previous games where the team conceded goals, however, the Crimson quickly found its footing and buckled down for the rest of the stanza, not allowing Brown to get off any more shots.
It took almost 21 minutes for Harvard to get its first shot off, as freshman defender Taner Dogan registered the first two shots before the Crimson managed three more in the final 10 minutes of play.
It was a similar start to the second half, as the Bears outshot Harvard by a 3-1 margin within the first 20 minutes of play before Gylling’s goal put the Crimson ahead. It became a scrappy affair from there on out, with the two teams combining for 11 fouls from that point onward while Brown continued to look for an equalizer.
Parks was tested in the 80th minute after Brown sophomore midfielder Matthew Chow played a through ball past the Harvard backline to teammate Nico Lozada but Parks rushed out of the box to collect the ball and prevent any chance at goal. Though the Bears managed a total of seven shots in the second stanza, they failed to properly threaten the Crimson defense as the team saw the rest of the game out.
Wheeler-Omiunu credits the success of the team to the commitment the team has put to detail leading up to every game this season.
“It’s that commitment to detail.” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “The more we play with each other, the chemistry is going to continue to improve but that commitment to being in the right spots, working hard for each other defensively and offensively...we’re playing very much together on both sides of the ball.”
With the victory, Harvard retains pace with fellow conference leaders Dartmouth and Columbia with seven points. With only four games left in the Ancient Eight calendar, the Crimson heads into a key stretch of road games against Princeton and the Big Green that will likely go a long way in deciding whether or not the team is able to challenge for the title.
Last year, the Crimson headed into its game against the Tigers with three wins in three Ivy games but dropped the next two games against Princeton and Dartmouth to drop the team to third in the conference. This year, the task becomes a little bit harder as Harvard will likely have to win both games while on the road before returning home to face Columbia.
Despite the importance of the upcoming stretch of games, however, the Crimson will look to focus on making improvements during its own preparations to perfect the factors it can control. In doing so, the team hopes to eliminate any potential distractions revolving around other teams or the conference standings.
“The more and more wins we put together, the more confident we are going into each and every game.” Freeman said. “We’ve got to use that drive and go into Princeton with that confidence and just take it one game at a time knowing we can beat every team out there and we have all the tools necessary to win these games coming up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard came into the weekend looking to continue its success after winning the Nicholas Bartlett Trophy last weekend. This weekend, across the table, ended in disappointment as the Crimson was in the back of the pack in three regattas, only salvaging a decent third place performance at the New England Match Race Championship.
NEW ENGLAND MATCH RACE CHAMPIONSHIP
Harvard came into Sunday in the middle of the pack, ranked fourth, with the opportunity to secure a place in the National Championships. Juniors, skipper Taylor Ladd and co-captain and skipper Nick Sertl, along with crew Dylan Farrell, looked to defend the title of this Salve Regina-hosted regatta. The breezy Narragansett Bay winds promised good racing with Ynglings on Sunday.
The Crimson came into the contest with a large focus on beating its rival, Dartmouth, who  Harvard beat last year in a tiebreaking final round sweep, 2-0. Neither team, however, would win. Boston College nabbed the first spot, while the Big Green and the Crimson took second and third, respectively. Harvard finished right outside the qualifying spots and won’t contend for a national championship in San Diego, Calif. later this fall.
TRUXTUN UMSTED
The Crimson looked for another strong showing this weekend on the Severn River in Annapolis, Md. after the team came in third place last year. Harvard attended one of their largest regattas of the fall with four separate divisions and 20 teams from around the country. The A, B, C, and D divisions sailed FJs, Z420s, Lasers and Laser Radials, respectively in this regatta hosted by Navy.
“This weekend we were racing against a different set of competition than we do in New England,” sophomore skipper Andrew Puopolo said. “Because of that, we definitely learned a lot sailing against a different group. Not necessarily a better group, but a different group.”
Saturday’s racing started late due to the absence of wind. It didn’t get easier from there, as light 2-5 knot wind and a strong current made for difficult racing. Sunday’s conditions were similarly difficult until after lunch recess, when 8-12 knot winds made for a breezy end of the regatta.
“[The wind] was pretty light, very challenging conditions down in Annapolis,” Puopolo said. “Lots of motor boats coming through our course and very patchy winds. It was important to stay in the places with the most pressure, sailing where there was the most wind.”
The Crimson could not find last year’s success, as they finished with over 200 points in three of the four divisions. Harvard’s C division performed strongest with Puopolo racing his laser to 158 points and finishing in the top half of his division. The result did not meet expectations, as Harvard  finished 16th overall with 785 points.
YALE WOMEN’S REGATTA
The Crimson women looked to improve from their 17th place finish last year with a better showing in Branford Harbor, Conn. The wind conditions of 5-10 knots, at least, were more favorable than last year’s gusts.
Sailing Z420s and FJs, Harvard looked to take on its Ivy League rivals at the Yale hosted tournament. The Crimson, however, was remarkably consistent. Once again, they finished in 17th, place with 287 points. The A division, consisting of sophomore skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Emma Wheeler finished in the middle of the pack with 116 points. In the B division, freshman skipper Jessica Williams and junior crew Kristin Anderson did not do as well, finishing near the back with 171 points.
CAPTAIN HURST BOWL
The regatta hosted by Dartmouth on Lake Mascoma featured three divisions. Harvard, racing Z420s, was looking for better success than last year’s 16th place finish.
The Crimson’s A Division put in a strong effort, placing near the middle of their division. Harvard’s B and C divisions did not do nearly as well, scoring 84 and 111 points respectively. The end result was a 15th place, 263 point finish.
FIREFLY/FJ INVITATIONAL
The Crimson had mixed results in this MIT hosed regatta that saw the A division racing FJs and the B division using Fireflys, but ultimately came out in the middle of the pack after scores were combined. This seven race regatta saw swirling 2-6 knot winds earlier in the weekend, which were harder to sail through than the steadier 8-10 knot winds for the last two races.
Freshman skipper Victoria Marquez and sophomore crew Alejandra Resendiz performed well, tying Bowdoin’s first team for the second lowest points in the A division with a score of 30. The B division sailing tandem of junior skipper Ben Zheng and freshman crew Amalia Frohna ended up with a relatively high score of 82, pushing Harvard out of title contention and into eighth place with 112 points.
