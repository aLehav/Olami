After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second night of Rolling Loud began with a prediction from Future: “This might be one of the craziest Rolling Louds I have ever been a part of.” Indeed, the rapper would go on to headline an unforgettable night in Sky-ami — and his performance would single-handedly change the course of the many more to come.
The festival’s energy went through the roof as soon as Future’s set began. The Atlanta rapper, who also calls himself Future Hendrix, dove right into the heat of his discography with “Stick Talk.” “Let me see if Miami in the building,” DJ and hype man DJ ESCO exclaimed in an effort to excite the crowd, getting them ready for bops like “Bugatti” and “Me or Sum” from Florida-natives Ace Hood and Nardo Wick, respectively. For someone who has been performing on stage for more than ten years, Future wasn’t slacking in the entertainment department. He was enthusiastic and genuinely engaged, getting the crowd involved and setting a good pace for the hour-long concert.
“I gotta free my twin. Sing y’all, we gotta get Thugger to hear this shit,” Future said before diving into Young Thug’s “Relationship,” advocating for the nationwide “Free YSL” movement (which had a big festival presence) in support of Young Thug and other artists on his label YSL Records. As a matter of fact, a significant portion of his setlist was dedicated to covering fellow rappers. From playing Lil Wayne’s entire verse on “Love Me,” to getting the crowd to put up their L’s for Weeknd’s verse on “Low Life,” to letting Tems’ sweet vocals echo throughout Hard Rock Stadium on “Wait For U,” Future didn’t hesitate to share the limelight with previous collaborators.
The headliner also didn’t shy away from single covers including Gunna’s “pushin P,” A$AP Ferg’s “New Level,” and Lil Durk’s “AHHH HA,” which he brought out Durk himself to perform. Future was content to hang back for the next couple of tracks, giving the Chicago rapper the chance to perform “Hellcats & Trackhawks” before the pair were joined by Real Boston Richey for “Keep Dissin 2.” It’s important to note that Future is not a collaborator on either of these tracks, but that didn’t stop him from sharing his Rolling Loud stage as a platform for acknowledging and uplifting the young talent in rap throughout his set.
A prime example of Future’s influence in the rap industry came to light when he brought out Travis Scott during his set. Following the controversial Astroworld tragedy in which 10 festival goers died and over 4,900 were injured during Scott’s performance, the rapper (and festival planners) faced plenty of criticism for his failure to intervene while attendees were calling for help. The result for Scott was a months-long period of no concerts, festivals, or guest appearances. Whether this performance hiatus was self-imposed or not, Future welcomed him back onto the stage for the first time in eight months, reintroducing him into the world of live performance once again.
After being away for so long, the 31-year-old rapper gave an explosive return to the stage. Screaming in pure excitement and bouncing around the stage with an infectious enthusiasm, Scott even had Future himself letting out a shocked “Sheesh!” With the way he was radiating unbridled energy the whole time, it was clear to any onlookers that Scott had missed performing, and that now that he had returned for a night, he was right back in his element.
Despite the controversy still surrounding the rapper post-Astroworld, Scott was backed-up by the festival organizers, who issued a statement that no, Scott was never banned from performing at the festival despite rumors otherwise. On the contrary, he was invited to headline but the timing didn’t work out.
Not only did the festival give Scott the chance to return to the stage, Future also shared a huge chunk of his time in the spotlight on stage with the Houston rapper. Scott performed a total of five songs back to back. Three of these didn’t include Future, who seemed content to sit back and just support Scott, often hyping him up with motivational phrases like “Man do that shit you do,” “Go off some more,” and “Like you never left.” This was a testament to Future’s selflessness — a statement of his power and humbleness as he works to uplift an entire generation of young artists.
Future lived up to the phrase ‘real recognize real’ on Saturday.
That’s not to say he didn’t dedicate some quality time to his own music. His setlist included a variety of songs showcasing different albums, like “Stick Talk” from 2015’s “DS2” and “Wicked” from 2016’s “Purple Reign.” And while he didn’t shy away from throwbacks, a majority of Future’s songs were off his newly released album “I NEVER LIKED YOU.” Hits like “WORST DAY” and “LOVE YOU BETTER” from the 2022 album were popular with the crowd, even though the album came out only two months prior to the show. If that wasn’t impressive enough, Future got the crowd lit again and again, hit after hit, for an hour straight, establishing himself as an artist who’s discography is filled to the brim with chart-toppers.
With this performance, Future proved he is an artist in full control, one who knows how to give the crowd exactly what they want in a setlist jam packed with hits from start to finish. Not only that, the rapper also cemented himself as an icon for the culture, showing that he respects his fellow rappers and would ride for them through thick and thin. On top of that, by highlighting the young talent in the rap scene and providing a space for them to continue performing, Future fulfilled his prediction that everyone will remember Rolling Loud 2022.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s Rolling Loud festival proved contentious before it even began. Headliner Kanye West’s decision to drop out a week prior to the show’s onset left many fans disappointed but not surprised — he had done the same ahead of his scheduled headlining set at this year’s Coachella, afterall. The bigger shock came from the festival’s decision to tap Kid Cudi as the replacement act, as it’s no secret that the two have been publicly beefing since February 2022.
The last-minute lineup change had a lot of people heated. The decision, in fact, was so controversial that festival organizers soon had to issue a statement explaining that they did not take the decision “lightly” given that this was “the first time a headliner has ever [pulled out]” of Rolling Loud. Ye fans were pressed to find out their expensive tickets were non-refundable, and Cudi fans were also left upset that they couldn’t secure those same expensive tickets this late in the game.
Things only grew more complicated as day one of the three day hip hop festival winded down.
Immediately after Playboi Carti’s performance ended, a big portion of the crowd dissipated from the main Ciroc stage. Some left the festival entirely to beat the traffic home, too exhausted after Carti’s legendary mosh pits. Some dashed over to see Lil Durk headline the adjacent GoPuff stage. And some Ye fans could be heard leaving out of protest for their fickle idol. With festival goers steadily trickling out only minutes before Kid Cudi’s call-time, an uneasy feeling settled over Hard Rock stadium.
The tense atmosphere was palpable.
Still, Cudi went out on stage with a positive, undefeated attitude. In performing “Down and Out,” he started off energetically, with triumphant screams of “Ha ha ha!” and “Yeah motherfucker what up?” Those gave way to calls of “Y’all came to see me?” acknowledging the whole headliner-swap situation — not in a defeatist way, but rather with a confidence that he could deliver a great performance in spite of the multiple factors working against him.
In the grand scheme of his set, Cudi seemed like he was having fun and vibing with the Miami crowd. The festival goers could be heard chanting Cudi’s name after he called to “get this party started,” to the beat of “Revofev,” while stomping around the stage. His energy was infectious and the audience was definitely receptive to his charms for the first half of the set.
But it was during the verse of “Marijuana” where things went horribly south. The soft melodies in the outro were overpowered by the shouts of a boisterous crowd starting to get rowdy. Just before the song could end with the lyric “Trust me, it’s gon be okay,” Cudi was hit in the face by a half-full water bottle. The crowd let out a collective gasp, bracing for the impact they knew was bound to come.
“If y’all throw one more fucking thing up here, I will leave,” Cudi promised, unveiling his frustration at what appeared to be an uncommon occurence that night. “You will ruin it for everybody,” he said, calling to the fact that unlike the people who were throwing things, the majority of the audience was indeed enjoying the set as much as Cudi himself was up until this point. It was a promise he kept after someone threw another item, prompting him to walk off without any hesitation. Immediately, screams of denial and disappointment followed, along with many chants of “Cudi!” begging him to come back. True to his word, Cudi had left for good.
Many people blamed the Miami crowd after the fact, due to how fast they switched up from being supportive to being a nightmare. But in reality, the majority of the audience were genuinely enjoying the performance, and all it took was two trolls to “ruin” it for everybody.
Thus Cudi’s concert was over barely 20 minutes after it began. Half an hour later, Lil Durk brought out West.
At first glance, this seemed like a regular, scheduled appearance. The festival must have been in the know about it — they were the first to tweet it out. Lil Durk and Kanye have two songs together and they’re both from Chicago, so it’s not a stretch for Durk to bring him on as a special guest in the middle of performing “Hot Shit.”
When Kanye went on to perform “Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1” however, the performance started to seem fishy. Not only is Lil Durk nowhere to be found on that track, but it is also one of the many songs Ye has featuring none other than Kid Cudi. With this cameo being so suspiciously well-timed, it definitely came across like a last-minute decision to rub the salt onto Cudi’s fresh wound.
Kanye’s surprise performance was especially suspect given that the festival did not disclose the reason for his sudden dropping out, only that it was “for reasons out of [their] control.” Speculations for his dropping out of the festival were that the festival didn’t allow him to bring out Travis Scott — a line of reasoning which seems dubious at best, since Future would bring Scott out on Saturday.
It would seem that Kid Cudi was set up for failure — both by West and the festival itself — which fated his performance to be a disappointment for many. The biggest slap in the face was to the real Cudi fans spectating, but considering that he was announced as headliner with only five days of advance notice, perhaps there  weren't that many of them in the crowd to begin with.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of top American corporations and universities including Apple, Google, and seven Ivy League schools asked the Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action in amicus briefs filed this week as justices prepare to hear lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.
Sixty briefs were filed with the court representing more than 2,300 entities, including major corporations, Democratic lawmakers, military officials, and civil rights leaders. The Biden administration also submitted a brief asking the court not to do away with affirmative action.
Just shy of 80 Democratic officials signed onto briefs supporting Harvard and UNC, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Massachusetts Senators Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren. An array of industry giants also backed the schools, including American Airlines, Uber, Starbucks, Meta, General Electric, and General Motors.
The filings come one week after Harvard and UNC asked the court to allow colleges and universities to consider race in their admissions processes. The schools are both being sued by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which alleges they illegally discriminate against Asian American applicants.
SFFA, which first sued Harvard in 2014, asked the Supreme Court in May to overturn Grutter v. Bollinger, the landmark 2003 decision that allowed colleges and universities to consider race when making admissions decisions. Two lower courts have previously ruled in Harvard’s favor.
The Supreme Court agreed to jointly take up SFFA’s lawsuits against Harvard and UNC in January, but reversed course and separated the cases last month. More than 80 Republican lawmakers had previously filed briefs supporting SFFA in May.
Many of the amicus briefs outlined similar arguments, telling justices that race-conscious admissions at universities play a crucial role in fostering racial diversity.
The Biden administration argued in a 45-page filing submitted Monday that the Supreme Court should uphold precedent allowing race-conscious admissions, writing that “the educational benefits of diversity remain a compelling interest of vital importance to the United States.”
In a separate filing, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar requested to participate in oral arguments before the court this fall, noting that Harvard, UNC, and SFFA have all consented to the motion.
Attorneys general from 19 states and Washington, D.C., filed a brief supporting Harvard and UNC. Twenty states had filed briefs in support of SFFA in May.
Twenty-five Harvard student and alumni organizations, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, wrote in a brief filed last week that “race-conscious admissions are as important now as ever before—to ensure the ‘[e]ffective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation.’”
“America in particular thrives when all of its children know they, too, can pursue and be rewarded for their hard work,” said Harold S. Lewis ’85, vice president of the group First Generation Harvard Alumni, which signed onto the amicus brief.
More than 30 senior U.S. military officials also filed a brief asking the court to uphold affirmative action. The group, which includes four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told justices that “officer corps diversity is far more than a laudable goal—it is a strategic imperative.”
“History has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and violence,” the officials wrote. “By contrast, units that are diverse across all levels are more cohesive, collaborative, and effective.”
Several civil rights organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the ACLU, also filed a brief in support of affirmative action.
In two separate filings, 80 major corporations argued that race-conscious admissions at universities play a vital role in training business leaders.
The companies wrote that they “are strengthened when their team members and leaders have rich and individualized experiences with people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. University education remains an essential environment for fulfilling that need.”
More than 100 colleges and universities asked the court to allow them to continue using race in their admissions processes.
Fifteen elite institutions — including the other seven Ivy League schools — wrote in a filing that a ruling in favor of SFFA “would break with this Court’s long tradition of granting universities wide latitude in their educational judgments—a tradition that protects universities’ own constitutional interests as well as the status of American higher education as the envy of the world.”
MIT and Stanford filed a brief with the tech companies IBM and Aeris that focused on the importance of racial diversity in STEM education and industry.
The University of California and University of Michigan systems — which are barred by state law from considering race in admissions — also submitted pro-affirmative action briefs to the court.
“The University’s 15-year-long experiment in race-neutral admissions thus is a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants,” the University of Michigan wrote.
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane and SFFA founder Edward J. Blum both declined to comment on the filings.
SFFA’s reply to Harvard is due to the Supreme Court by August 25. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case at the start of its fall term this year.
