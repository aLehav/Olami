After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme” is a prayer—a pan-religious offering to God sent by a man who has been through the ringer of drug abuse, infidelity, and fame, a man who would die only three years later of liver cancer at the age of 40. The album hovers with Miles Davis’s “Kind of Blue” in the rarefied air of jazz albums that have fundamentally shifted the pop culture Zeitgeist.
The 1964 piece, a 33-minute, 4-part suite unified by a spiritual communication with the beyond, was the proto-concept album several years before concept albums were even being discussed—would there have been a “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” without Coltrane’s vision of an album with a thesis? If the enthusiastic standing-room only crowd that came to see Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music Ingrid Monson’s colloquium on the piece on Sept. 3 was any indication, the influence of Coltrane’s magnum opus continues to awe half a century after the saxophonist’s death.
Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the Alphonse Fletcher University professor and director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, introduced the colloquium, the center’s first in a series that will continue once a week throughout the year. Gates gave an introduction to the crowd assembled in the Barker Center’s Thompson Room. “Ingrid Monson occupies the first chair endowed in honor of a jazz musician in the history of the world’s academies…. We searched far and wide and we found the very best person…who happened to have blonde hair, blue eyes, and be from Minnesota,” Gates said, eliciting loud chuckles from the crowd, which included Harvard faculty, elderly Coltrane fans, and students at the college, who could be heard comparing Coltrane to his great nephew, the electronic musician Flying Lotus.
From the beginning of the program, each speaker seemed conscious of the racial and political legacy of Coltrane and jazz music of the 1960s. In addition to Gates’s playful race commentary, he discussed the importance of the record to the black community in the late ’60s at Yale, where he was an undergrad. “There were three albums that everybody had to have: ‘Kind of Blue,’ ‘A Love Supreme,’ and, not Herbie Hancock, but, uh…,” Gates said, before a number of audience members, revealing their expertise, yelled out “Herbie Mann!” the slightly less iconic jazz flautist.
As soon as Monson came to the podium, after a heartfelt introduction by Vijay Iyer, a world-renowned jazz pianist and bandleader whom Monson helped to secure a professorship at Harvard earlier this year, it was clear that Coltrane’s musical and philosophical vision were the focal points of the day. “All praise be to God, to whom all praise is due,” Monson began, reading from the letter that Coltrane included in the gate-folded LP. At that, any broad political discussion faded away and a journey into the intricacies of the album began.
Before any listening took place, Monson gave the room perspective on its recording. The entirety of the playing took place on one night. Coltrane, bassist Jimmy Garrison, drummer Elvin Jones, and pianist McCoy Tyner took to producer Rudy Van Gelder’s New Jersey studio. Monson clicked to a slide that showed Coltrane’s plan for the work—a single ledger-lined piece of paper detailing every modal shift, solo, and tempo in the piece. “These were the guidelines given to a group that he had been playing intensively with for three years with absolutely masterful results,” Monson said. “They knew they would mostly just follow Coltrane and each other.”
Monson played the opening cymbal reverberations of “Acknowledgement,” the first of Coltrane’s four movements. As Coltrane’s saxophone swirled majestically above the drums, Monson clued her audience to what was coming next. “We hear this bass ostinato—it fits to the words “A Love Supreme,” she said. Suddenly, the four-note progression became a low-registered mumbling, a human voice in an instrument’s body.
Over the next 40 minutes, Monson repeated her initial exercise, giving voice, either through music theory or through words Coltrane intended the instruments to evoke, to the rest of the album—the rising mantra of “Acknowledgement,” the bass-heavy tumultuousness of “Resolution,” the spare “Pursuance,” and the plaintive sustained saxophone of “Psalm.” Often, Monson played a section three times, pointing out Jones’s tempo change on the drums or Tyner’s impossibly quick transpositions. In “Psalm,” she revealed a dynamic reading of Coltrane’s playing: “‘Psalm’ is a recitation in music of the poem that is included on the album cover,” she said. “The band did not know he was using the text because he had memorized it.” As the piece played, she shined a laser pointer on the words that corresponded with Coltrane’s solo. Even as the music swirled into abstraction, Coltrane continued to play the prayer. Eventually Q&A and the subsequent dispersal would occur, but, for the moment, it was time to meditate.

After years of evolution, Karen O is back where she started. As the combustible frontwoman of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, she’s gone from lo-fi freakouts to synth-heavy punk, from maximalist alien-core to sharing the Oscar stage with Ezra Koenig. But with “Crush Songs,” her first proper solo album, O (short for Orzolek) returns to the low-tech tape recorders on which she cut her teeth.
Actually, labeling the album a return is a bit unfair. Its 15 sparse, acoustic love ditties were recorded between 2006 and 2010, and while they share the tape hiss of O’s early work with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, they’re much more delicate, having more in common with O’s “The Moon Song” from “Her” than the roaring and bashing of 2003’s “Fever to Tell.” But while “Crush Songs” may be loose, even borderline unfinished, it also hits hard, shattering its bedroom-pop trappings with unfiltered emotional heft.
Karen O has admitted that the record’s songs weren’t intended for release, at least at first. They were outlets for her buried feelings, more impulsive bursts of steam than well-crafted compositions. Her melodies sound almost improvised as they float over makeshift beds of loosely strummed guitar—and in the case of “Visits,” a clunky drum machine. That track sounds particularly impromptu, as O plucks a single note on her guitar while repeating “I don’t know / I don’t / I don’t / I don’t / know.” It feels a little slight, but at just a minute and a half, “Visits” has no delusions of grandeur.
Not a single track breaks the three-minute mark, and while some cuts don’t quite get off the ground, most songs soar. While lead single “Rapt” is structurally simple—a few verses, a few choruses—its loping melody hypnotizes from the whispered count-off to the cat-like squeal at the end. O packs the song with a delicate lyrical back-and-forth, detailing the irrationality of love by asking, “Do I really need / Another habit like you,” and then impulsively answering, “I really need / Do you need me too?”
But for all its hidden complexity, “Crush Songs” is the sound of a woman emptying her heart into a tape recorder, and its most powerful moments are its most raw. “Body” is a simple four-chord mantra: “Make it right for yourself / If you love somebody / Anybody.” They’re uplifting words, but O’s wavering voice sounds wounded, as if she’s trying to convince herself that “There will always be someone else.” Her false positivity finally breaks at the end of the song, when she plunges into an uptempo interlude filled with the wordless screeching that would be common on a typical Yeah Yeah Yeahs record. But unlike on the band’s albums, which are littered with black comedy, O’s screaming on “Body” is a moment of earnest catharsis.
It’s tempting to wish that O had done more with these rough demos. Imagine a full band rendition of the poppy but personal “Native Korean Rock” (O is half Korean), or a version of the melancholy ballad “NYC Baby” with touches of strings or a subdued guitar solo. But these are songs born of emotion, and the album’s magnetism lies in the fact that it’s a document of feelings being put to words and music for the first time. In an era when even the most indie of indie bands are using digital trickery and striving for pristine sound, there’s something to be said for a record made impulsively, at home, with friends instead of session recruits. O has plenty of years ahead of her to please critics and tickle eardrums. For now, she’s doing just fine piercing hearts.

Children have poor taste. Unfortunately, as people continue to have children in large numbers, children command the attention and resources of the film industry to a degree unmerited by their lack of sophistication, and so “Air Bud” films and Cartoon Network shows continue to proliferate.
It is with this state of affairs in mind that one must approach Charles Martin Smith’s “Dolphin Tale 2,” which is, needless to say, the first sequel to “Dolphin Tale.” It is not meant to be a good movie, but rather a movie that is written, acted, and filmed to please an audience with undeveloped bodies and still-defective intellects and aesthetics; which is to say, it is a movie that is is meant to make a lot of money on a relatively modest budget (the series’s first installment took in roughly $72 million on an estimated budget of $37 million). By the latter standard, perhaps “Dolphin Tale 2” is a success—only the box office returns will tell. By the former, however, it is an exemplar of the genre of “family movie”: it is not a very good film in any way.
The entire enterprise is so submerged in utter predictability that there is little redeeming to discuss. The plot is a slurry of non-events that are stitched together to reach the required time for a feature-length film. The first “Dolphin Tale” recounts the real-life story of the discovery and rehabilitation of the dolphin Winter, whose damaged tail is amputated and replaced by a specially manufactured prosthetic, providing the weak pun of the title. In “Dolphin Tale 2,” the characters of the first film are reintroduced. Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble), an early adolescent of indeterminate age, is a volunteer at the aquarium-cum-veterinary hospital where Winter lives. When Winter’s companion dolphin Panama dies, Winter enters a phase of depression and lashes out at Sawyer, prompting the aquarium director, Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.), to stop him from working with the dolphin. In the meantime, Sawyer has been offered a spot in a semester-long marine biology program at Boston University. In the meantime, a pelican named Rufus gets up to all sorts of zany antics at the aquarium. In the meantime, Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff), another volunteer, develops a crush on Sawyer. In the meantime, Dr. Cameron McCarthy (Morgan Freeman, who seems to act with a certain wry awareness) works on a new prosthetic for Winter. These threads, although they are all resolved, only occasionally converge. It is just one damned thing after another, but the sentimentality of each plot line will doubtless resonate with soft hearts and soft heads.
The cinematography is competent, if middling. It relies heavily on shaky-cam action shots, inspiring in the viewer not an impression of vividness so much as seasickness. Several needless and poorly-executed montages naively recall the worst in ’80s cinema. The sequences of dolphins swimming are resplendent and slick in their digitally-altered luminosity, the best visual greasiness that Hollywood money can buy. A particularly annoying tic is the use of “animal-eye” shots, half-submerging the camera in water with no apparent purpose besides showing that the shot can be done: most of these shots are merely empty frames that are half water and half sky.
Every film does not have to be deep and serious. Cinema is the most democratic medium, and it is often at its best when it puts entertainment in the driver’s seat; this summer’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” comes immediately to mind. Unfortunately, for most audience members, “Dolphin Tale 2” will not even rise to the level of entertaining. Let the unhappy viewer be consoled in by the fact that his dissatisfaction may be taken as a hopeful sign that he has progressed beyond the maturity level of the average American pre-teen.

To the editor:
I am an unapologetic smoker who retired from Harvard five years ago after serving 22 years as a library assistant at the law school. The Harvard Yard smoking ban, and the efforts of anti-tobacco reformers to prohibit smoking on all American university campuses, are designed not for the usual secondhand smoke protection rationale, but to alienate and ostracize smokers. Reformers call this policy "de-normalization."
If, when I was a library assistant, I had been required to leave campus for a cigarette, it would have taken so much time, my employment would have been put in danger. Likewise, for students, professors, or workers who wish to smoke, to be required to leave campus would handicap them to the point of jeopardizing their place at the university. This is exactly what anti-smoking reformers want.
Two years ago, Dr. Howard Koh, assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, announced a federal initiative to pressure universities to prohibit tobacco. Koh said the purpose is “to protect people from tobacco dependence.” In other words, to protect students from making unapproved of decisions--hardly a vote of confidence in their judgment. Implicit in Koh’s announcement was the threat to withhold federal funds from universities who don't cooperate.
When Koh was director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, he boasted at a meeting I attended, that he had considered demanding the phrase “You are the scum of the earth” be printed on all cigarette packs sold in Massachusetts. As a federal official and a physician, Koh’s scorn—quite representative of anti smoking reformers in general—for those almost 20% of American adults who smoke, is unconscionable.

To the editor:
In an article in these pages (“Neocons Rising,” Sept. 8, 2014) a few days ago a fellow member of the Harvard community commented on the discrepancy between the public’s disapproval of President Obama’s foreign policy and their apparent approval for individual decisions that he has made.
This mismatched position of concurrently feeling the president is weak while agreeing with his actions must have an explanation, and the author identified one. Yes, you guessed it: The dreaded neocons are on their way back, bringing their distortions and warmongering with them.
But are the neocons actually back? We can only hope so.
For liberals there is no bugbear quite like the neoconservative. When it comes to foreign policy they are blamed for almost everything. Spoken about almost invariably in conspiratorial terms, they are accused of everything from fabricating evidence surrounding WMDs in Iraq, to being subservient to Israel, to preferring war to peace. There appears to be no low to which they will not stoop in the liberal popular imagination.
In reality, there is nothing to be feared or disapproved of in the principles of the neoconservatives. They represent a clear, moral voice in our body politic, and one that has not given up on the vision of a better world, not just one that is more politically convenient.
Neocons believe in the promotion of democracy and human rights—not just in hollow speeches on the campaign trail, but as a priority for our foreign policy.
Neocons believe that at times in our world we are confronted with good and evil, and it is our duty to offer succor to one and dispatch the other.
If it is true that the American people are turning away from the Obama-view of the world, and embracing the principles of the Neoconservatives, it is hardly difficult to see why.
Perhaps it is because they see President Obama standing idly by as the Butcher of Damascus gasses his citizens, despite explicitly saying he would not allow it. Perhaps it is because they see Putin dismembering Ukraine and the Obama administration offering nothing other than empty rhetoric.
Probably it is because Americans demand more from their president than a shrug of the shoulders and a desire to avoid taking responsibility for anything in the international sphere.
It is not in the American character to shirk responsibility, but that is exactly what President Obama is doing. It took the brutality of ISIS being beamed onto our smartphones for the administration to even think about doing anything about this barbarism.
The threat to American (and indeed global) security today is not from the return of a stronger Neoconservative moment. Rather the true danger lies in a collapse into the isolationist navel gazing of which Obama is only the shallow water and Rand Paul the deep blue sea.
The American people recognize that Obama has taken us right to the brink. Only a principled and robust approach can drag us back. It is neoconservative ideology that offers it.

The Administrative Board recently tightened its regulations regarding simultaneous enrollment, maintaining that students cannot rely on videotaped lectures to be an effective replacement for missed class time. This new policy serves little purpose, and will only be a detriment to learning for students at the College.
There is nothing necessarily wrong with the practice of watching lectures rather than attending them. Large lectures with hundreds of students and minimal interactivity do not necessarily present any better learning value than videotaped lectures that can be slowed down, paused, and watched at one’s desk or library. The Ad Board’s embrace of the former over the latter represents an attachment to a traditional method of teaching that is not proven to be universally more effective. It should be up to students to decide how they best learn, and how they wish to structure their schedule.
If a teacher prefers interactivity, and believes that his course will be limited by students missing lecture, then he or she can choose not to film the class, or to make the films available only for students with excused absences. A lecturer could also integrate participation into students’ grades such that students would be hesitant to miss lecture. It should be up to each individual instructor to choose whether he or she believes that students will gain from attending class, or whether they should be allowed to substitute videotaping for lecture.
Students will still have the opportunity to attend office hours and sections, and will consequently still be interacting with their professors and peers—CS50, exempted from the Ad Board’s rule, does not have a monopoly on learning without lecture attendance. We do believe that there is value in this exchange of ideas and support the continuation of sections with physical student presence. There is difference between sections and lectures that the Ad Board has failed to recognize.
Ultimately, the consequence of the Ad Board’s decision is a negative limit on students’ abilities to pursue the fields they most wish to study. The major lecture classes often meet at the most heavily trafficked time in the day; consequently, if a student wishes to take one of these classes—and often must, as a result of General Education or concentration requirements—he or she becomes very limited in what other classes he or she can take. At Harvard, the primary focus of the institution is learning, as well as the freedom of students to pursue their specific studies in a liberal arts setting. It is important that, going forward, the administration recognizes this goal of expanding students’ learning opportunities, and becomes more willing to embrace new technology and methods of study to further this goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Robin Williams ended his life last month, his suicide sparked a raft of online and print commentary about the dangers of depression and the need to inject more resources into our mental health care system. I strongly agree with these sentiments. After all, as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, I regularly speak with patients who have been diagnosed with depression or who are actively thinking about ending their lives.
But what if suicide prevention isn’t just about better screening, diagnosis, and treatment of depression? What if there were a better way to go about preventing suicides?
It is undeniable that people with mental illnesses such as depression and bipolar disorder are at greater risk for suicidal thinking or suicide attempts. But not everyone with depression commits suicide, and not everyone who has committed suicide suffered from depression. In fact, even though depression is a strong predictor of suicidal thinking, it does not necessarily predict suicide attempts among those who have been thinking about suicide.
These epidemiological facts have been on my mind with World Suicide Prevention Day occurring just this week. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. among young adults. It is also a global phenomenon: As described in the World Health Organization’s recently published landmark report on suicide prevention, suicide accounts for nearly 1 in 10 deaths among young adults worldwide. So it is very likely that many of the students reading this essay have had their lives touched in some way by suicide, either through the suicide of a family member or friend, or even a friend of a friend.
While I spend my clinical time providing mental health treatment services as a psychiatrist, I spend my research time trying to better understand the social factors driving suicide. In collaboration with colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health, I recently published a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine showing that social connectedness is an important protective factor against suicide among middle-aged men. Although not directly generalizable to other age groups, our findings are consistent with smaller studies conducted among adolescents and young adults. The fact that we demonstrated our findings in a large cohort of generally healthy persons—rather than in a sample of study participants characterized by mental instability and high suicide risk—is particularly notable.
The field has come to view suicide almost solely through a psychiatric or psychological lens. Yet, as our research demonstrates, there may also be important social (or economic or political) factors to consider.
Clearly, then, suicide prevention is not just about improved screening, diagnosis and treatment of depression.
In contrast to the current focus on the mental health care system, a public health-oriented program might try to harness these and other related research findings to prevent suicide. The program would recognize that each completed suicide likely represents the final destination for a weary sojourner (and his or her family, friends, and wider community) whose previous layovers along an extended route of personal suffering could have provided many opportunities for earlier intervention.
While changes to the mental health care system—in terms of financing, access, and quality—would certainly deserve consideration, in the college campus context a public health-oriented suicide prevention program would promote emotional well-being and social cohesion among all students, not just those diagnosed with depression and thought to be at imminent risk for suicide. Here are just a few examples of hypothetical program elements.
All frosh could begin engaging in conversations about stress, achievement, and suicide through pre-orientation programs, extended orientation workshops, entryway meetings, or Community Conversations. Such curricula might include—hopefully not in a heavy-handed fashion—basic knowledge about key risk factors for suicide, referral pathways for students requiring urgent attention, and skills to implement minor interventions.
Programs during the school term would provide additional opportunities for reinforcement, such as through the Residential Education, Reflecting on Your Life, and thesis advising programs.
Those with particularly close ties to students—including resident tutors in the house advising system, proctors and host families in the Freshman Dean’s Office, and even graduate students in the Teaching Fellow program—could receive more detailed awareness education and training in suicide prevention. They themselves would also be encouraged to make appropriate use of mental health services when needed, to change the campus culture around seeking assistance.
Other program elements might involve allocating resources for preventive functions to be performed by mental health professionals outside of the clinical setting, changing policies to monitor suicide risk among students undergoing disciplinary proceedings, and establishing crisis teams to help House Masters and Freshman Proctors organize systematic responses in the event of student suicides, or creating surveillance databases.
Numerous institutions on campus—ranging from Harvard University Health Services and the Bureau of Study Counsel, to Room 13 and Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach—have made substantial progress towards helping us shift from viewing suicide solely as a psychiatric or psychological problem and instead viewing it as a community-wide problem.
Ultimately, the public health approach to suicide prevention would seek to change social norms about stress, both achievement and failure, and health care seeking behavior. On the Harvard campus, these goals are unlikely to be achieved overnight.

Prescott St. between Harvard St. and Broadway is quiet, unassuming. Nestled between the large Barker and Carpenter centers and smaller buildings, the street is half-shaded in the early afternoon.
But 20 Prescott St., one of the new swing housing sites for Dunster House, doesn’t fit the block’s peaceful mold. One apartment’s windows are adorned with big block letters which spell out “HIVE,” and music is thumping from the same apartment. Something like Blink-182 spills out into the courtyard.
Soon I am in this very room, and the music is still turned up loud. Standing before me are three dark-haired, slightly scruffy Dunster House seniors: Keenan Monks ’15,  Ben B. Nuzzo ’15, and Willie J. Pirc ’15. They’re the keepers of the “D-Hive,” and today they’re a bit hot—the apartment has no air-conditioning.
The lack of air conditioning becomes negligible once I tour the expansive apartment: it has a kitchen, three single bedrooms, a massive living room, and one-and-a-half bathrooms.
The apartment is airy and clean, albeit a little under-decorated. I soon learn that the three seniors are awaiting a flag and table that have a D-Hive logo on them. Their insignia is simple: a cursive “D-Hive” in front of a honeycomb pattern.
But the boys don’t love bees; the “D-Hive” has been the name of Monks’ and Nuzzo’s room since their sophomore year. They lived on the fifth floor in the H and I entryways in Dunster House, hence “D-HIVE.”
The concept of the D-Hive, which has little to do with the name, differs yet.
“I think the concept was kind of born when Keenan and I decided it would be cool if we had a proper common room and shared an 87-square foot bedroom,” Nuzzo explains.
Monks adds that they thought being social was more important than having singles. “So we bunked, and tried to get people to hang out,” he says.
Pirc, who’s new to the rooming group this year, frequented the Hive his sophomore and junior years.
Since the D-Hive’s beginnings, the boys’ passion for Dunster House has continued to grow. Monks is on the Housing Committee this year, and Pirc says that he “bleed[s] red for Dunster.” After picking the number two draw for the Dunster swing housing lottery, the boys are more excited than ever to transform their living space into a social one.
“Especially with swing housing now, we want there to be a room where a lot of Dunster people can congregate and still be connected,” Monks says. “We’re trying to make it that sort of space.”
In past years, the Hive’s been home to rap battles and pre-formal bashes. When the “call of the Hive goes out, people come in, and then we roll as a pack,” Monks explains.
This year’s space certainly feels party-ready. On display in the kitchen and common room are 19 empty Smirnoff bottles of all different colors; the three have collected most of the flavors offered in the Square. But, be sure—they didn’t finish it all by themselves.
The D-Hive seniors adhere closely to school policy. On weekends, the boys go through the official process to register their parties—Monks thinks that complying with House policy fosters a better community.
“We try to follow rules as much as we can and not make it hard for the people around us,” he says.
People come and go during the week, too. Today, a girl walks in during the interview and starts in on a story about her afternoon; then, she asks, “Is this the interview?” and says she’ll come back later.
“We tend to have open door policy,” Monks explains after she leaves. “That’s kind of a nice philosophy we have; you can always make time to hang out with someone.”
Besides hanging out, music and video games are integral aspects of the Hive. There’s a speaker system and a Wii console right underneath their cardboard moose head in the living room; Super Smash Bros is a “fan favorite” according to Pirc, and they’ll blast anything from EDM to k-pop.
This year, the boys are planning to put on a D-Hive Olympics, which would consist of tournaments in arm wrestling, Super Smash Bros, and a few other events.
But for now, the three D-Hivers are just settling into their new digs. “And once we get the flag and table, they’ll really mark the room,” Monks says.
When I laugh at this, Pirc sets me straight: “It’s not aggressive to have two logos in the room.”

UPDATED: September 12, 2014, at 2:31 p.m.
Hedge fund manager and founder of Moore Capital Management Louis M. Bacon has donated $3.5 million to the Harvard Kennedy School of Government for the creation of the eponymous Louis Bacon Environmental Leadership Program, the school announced Wednesday.
Bacon’s gift—which marks almost four months since the public launch of the HKS capital campaign in May—will fund up to five fellowships in environmental leadership at the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School.
In a press release on the school's website, Bacon credited a reliance on the future generation of public leaders in saving the environment as motivation for his donation.
“As both a country and a global community, we have inherited extraordinary natural resources from those who came before us,” Bacon said. “It is crucial that we now invest in and empower the rising generation to serve as good stewards of that sacred trust.”
HKS Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 agreed that Bacon’s donation will help the Kennedy School foster students interested in environment.
“Our shared environment grows more imperiled every day,” Ellwood said. “This program will bring to campus the kinds of emerging leaders who will serve as its most ardent and skillful stewards in the decades ahead.”

The College will offer an additional $30,000 in grants for domestic student group travel this academic year in response to recommendations from a working group convened last spring to discuss student organization transportation.
In addition to calling for increased funding, the Office of Student Life working group recommended that student organizations be “strongly encouraged” to register with the College any travel plans outside of the greater Boston area. Currently, student groups are only required to register international travel plans, and club sports teams register travel with the Athletics Department.
The group’s recommendations, laid out in a report dated July 2014 and obtained by The Crimson, come several months after Angela R. Mathew ’15 died in a car crash while returning to campus from a mock trial competition in February. The incident prompted College administrators to convene the working group to discuss student group transportation safety.
The working group includes administrators and representatives from student organizations and club sports teams. It presented its findings to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in a meeting Wednesday.
The recommendations emphasize the cost of travel as an impediment to student groups’ abilities to travel safely. According to results of the working group’s survey of traveling student organizations, 81 of 133 respondents identified funding and travel costs as a challenge to planning domestic travel.
“It is clear more funding would help student organizations that travel and such funding should be made available,” the report reads.
Additionally, survey results indicated that 58 student groups have left Massachusetts on a trip and returned to campus within 24 hours, suggesting that some students are traveling at night, possibly while fatigued.
Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, who sits on the working group, said the recommendations prompted the College to increase its budget for grants to traveling student groups to $50,000 for this year through the Dean of Harvard College’s Student Life Fund. Last year, the College offered $20,000 of that fund, which also supports House Committees, to student groups traveling to national-level or other special competitions in the U.S.
The working group has yet to determine how the College will allocate the additional funds among student groups, Friedrich said. The group will continue to meet this semester to implement that change and other recommendations. The OSL’s website has already been updated to include more information about travel, as suggested in the group’s report.
Among other recommendations, the working group called for the University to use its “purchasing power” to provide student organizations with discounted rates on transportation and accommodations.
In interviews, student members of the working group emphasized the importance of funding in enabling their peers to travel more safely. Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15—a longtime advocate of increased student group funding—said the need is far greater than $50,000.
“There can never be too much funding,” said Lauren N. Reisig ’16, a member of both the Harvard Mock Trial Association and the transportation working group.
Although the working group’s report does not specify a target figure, it cites the UC student activities fee, alumni donations, and the University-wide capital campaign as possible future funding sources. It also suggests that student leaders of organizations that receive funding to drive a vehicle complete a driver safety course.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tiffanie L. Ting, who served as acting dean in Currier House last spring and as a tutor there since 2008, was appointed as Cabot House’s new dean on July 17.
A graduate of the University of Toronto, Ting is currently a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education and holds a teaching appointment in the Sociology Department for this term.
“I look forward to collaborating with students as well as the House staff,” Ting said in an interview this summer, adding that she hopes to “learn about what matters most to students and how to support that.”
Ting’s arrival in Cabot House has coincided with the transition of its co-master, Rakesh Khurana, into the College deanship. Khurana began his term in University Hall on July 1, shortly before Ting’s appointment.
Ting said that she has a broad array of academic interests that include qualitative research design, the sociology of education, and the sociology of art.
Cabot House Co-Master Stephanie Khurana highlighted Ting’s experience and “openness to understanding the Cabot culture” as some of her strengths.
“We are lucky that she has six years of experience as a resident tutor,” Stephanie Khurana said, noting Ting’s work as a senior tutor, arts tutor, and as a sophomore advisor. “She has a holistic perspective of students and really looks forward to getting to know every student.”
Khurana also said that Ting’s academic work at the Graduate school of Education, where she studies advising, will position her to help students weigh their career trajectories, and that her passion for arts may help her contribute to the Third Space—a student-run art studio in Cabot.
After receiving a master’s degree from the Graduate School of Education in 2002, Ting worked as an education fellow at the deCordova Museum in Lincoln, Mass., before working at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston as its museum educator.
She served as the director of public programs and education at the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery in Ontario, Canada. Since 2002, Ting has also worked as a teaching fellow for classes at the Graduate School of Education.
Ting takes the place of Emily W. Stokes-Rees, who left Harvard earlier this summer after just two years as resident dean. A report released this summer included a name change for the position, formerly known as Allston Burr Resident Dean, as well as a requirement that all House-level deans have a Ph.D.

The Berkman Center for Internet and Society held a kickoff event for its Digital Problem Solving Initiative, a year-long program that brings together students and mentors from across the University to solve campus-wide issues through technology, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Gutman Library on Thursday.
Following an introduction from Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and a lecture on best practices for entrepreneurship from Business School professor Thomas R. Eisenmann, students and advisors split up into eight teams focused on particular on-campus problems.
The issues that the teams discussed included improving open access policies, running a more sustainable farmers market, developing data analysis tools, improving access to online education, exploring interactive documentary workshops, publicizing and addressing sexual assault data on campus, and creating useful apps for students and the entire Harvard Community.
“It had struck me, [while] sitting in many deans’ meetings as we talked about problems across campus, that there is competency and knowledge in a younger generation to tackle the issues that the University faces as it seeks to harness digital possibilities,” said Minow, who started the initiative.
After receiving broad support from deans across the University, the program was pilot-tested successfully last year. This year, the program boasts 36 participants and 13 mentors, divided into project teams according to their interests and skill sets.
Law School professor and Berkman Center Director Urs Gasser said the initiative not only aims to tackle problems across the University but also seeks to develop students “digital literacy skills.”
“[The Initiative] is an opportunity...to engage in problem-solving and test out ways in which students and mentors can collaborate and learn from each other,” Gasser said.
Multiple undergraduates involved in the initiative agreed with Gasser, referencing the initiative’s interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial feel.
“The fact that we have members of all different schools of Harvard makes it really worthwhile to join this project,” Kelwen Peng ’17 said.
“For me, I’m interested in film,” said Debbie N. Onuoha ’15, who is working to create films for and about the community. “Any opportunity to work in film and with other filmmakers is always welcome.”
For Minow, bringing together minds from across Harvard’s various schools may foster more effective problem-solving.
“Multidisciplinary teams can be more imaginative, more inventive, and come up with new ways to tackle really interesting problems,” Minow said. “If we do this well, I think it’s an avenue for Harvard as a University to remake what education is but also to exemplify how digital tools provide an occasion for interdisciplinary learning, cross-generational learning, and I hope a lot of fun.”

A professional magician entertained more than 100 students and staff at Currier House with card tricks and Harry Potter-style stunts during a magic show on Thursday.
The show, dubbed “Quad Magic,” was hosted by magician and special effects consultant Mark Mitton. Mitton, who has practiced magic for over 25 years, travels the world performing magic shows, including one that involved Will Smith suddenly appearing in the middle of Times Square.
Sounds of applause and laughter filled Currier House Fishbowl as Mitton performed over a dozen tricks, including transforming dough into an egg and pulling one glass through another. An interactive performer, he invited various members of the audience, including Currier House Masters Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross, to participate in particular steps of the tricks.
Mitton was invited to perform at Currier by Wrangham, who met him at an event a few months ago.
“I’m very keen on setting up events that bring together Quad students,” Wrangham said.
The performance was not Mitton’s first at Harvard. The magician, who has known Mather House Dean Luke A. Leafgren since high school, performed at Winthrop House and Mather House three years ago. His next show will be at Mather on Friday evening.
Mitton said he has always enjoyed performing for Harvard students and described the audience as “a fantastic crowd.”
After the show, he said the key to success as a magician is “curiosity.”
“If you are always curious about the world, you will always keep learning, and you don’t accept assumptions. [You need to] not think about things in a predicted way. It makes your thinking very adaptive,” Mitton said.
Members of the audience said they enjoyed the show, which some described as a welcome break as they settled into their classes.
Alexandra Rojek ’15, a resident of Currier House, said the show was “really fun.”
“It was a nice break from the craziness of shopping week and the beginning of the year,” she said. “He made the crowd really receptive.”
Happy Yang ’16 agreed.
“It makes me want to drop out of Harvard and become a magician,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 12, 2014, at 12:30 a.m.
Continuing its recent growth, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences added five new faculty members to its roster this fall, three of whom are women.
According to Assistant Dean for Communications Paul Karoff, with the five new professors who joined this fall, the School now employs 80 ladder faculty members. Thirteen of them are women, representing 16 percent of the School’s professors.
By comparison, last year's Faculty Development and Diversity annual report found that women make up 34 percent of junior professors and 24 percent of senior professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
In an interview with The Crimson last spring, SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said that increasing the presence of women in the School’s faculty was one of her administrative priorities.
“My goal, of course, is to be 50/50,” she said.
Assistant professor of electrical engineering Na Li, one of the new hires, said that she wishes there were more women in her division. Including Li, there are only two female professors teaching electrical engineering at the school.
Elsie M. Sunderland, another recent hire who teaches in the Environmental Science and Engineering Division, said that she is the only female professor in her area of study.
“I think it’s important for junior faculty to have senior women as mentors,” she said, adding that women faculty face unique challenges, such as balancing motherhood and work.
Despite these challenges, Sunderland said that her experience at the school has been positive thus far.
“The [SEAS] faculty has been incredibly supportive,” she said. “Everybody has been very helpful in orienting me through the administrative mechanisms and helping me get my lab set up over here.”
Speaking about adjusting to his new position, assistant Applied Physics and Mathmatics professor Ariel Amir said that his move to SEAS has gone well.
“I think this transition was as smooth as can be, and I’ve been enjoying a lot my last few months as faculty,” said Amir, who was previously a junior fellow in the Physics Department. He added that the role involved “much more responsibility” than his previous one, especially with regard to advising students.
Philip Kim and Finale Doshi-Velez also joined SEAS this fall, in the divisions of applied physics and computer science, respectively.

UPDATED: September 12, 2014, at 1:00 a.m.
The Graduate School of Education officially launched on Monday its Usable Knowledge project, an online platform aimed at making the school’s research and work accessible to all educators, students, and policymakers.
The goal of the project is “to put that knowledge directly into the hands of practitioners who can use it to make a difference in their classrooms, schools, districts, universities, and communities,” according to its official website.
“If we’re going to produce knowledge that matters and improves student outcomes, Usable Knowledge has to be a dialogue and not just a one-way street,” GSE Dean James E. Ryan said.
The website combines various social media outlets, like Twitter and Facebook, with Ed school Q&A videos, blogs, and taped lectures to create an immersive and engaging online experience for the user.  The website also features faculty advice and EdCasts, which discuss how to create a more caring and respectful classroom, as well as a series of ten briefs that analyze particular frameworks for early education programs across the United States.
“As more content rolls out, we'll offer toolkits and district-based stories on how research and best practices generated by HGSE faculty is being implemented across districts, states, and countries,” said Mary Tamer, the senior communications project manager for Usable Knowledge.
The genesis of Usable Knowledge developed from the principal belief that the research taking place at Harvard could achieve far greater impact if communicated and disseminated effectively to others working in the field of education, according to Ryan.
“After a day of managing a classroom, grading assignments, and preparing a future lesson plan, a teacher probably isn’t going to have time to read a full academic paper. But he or she may have time to watch a brief video on assessments and discover a better approach to prepare his or her students for a test,” Ryan said.
With its recent launch, reception to the Usable Knowledge website has been generally positive.
“The response both on and off campus has been positive and impressive,” Tamer said. “We had 10,000 visits to the website on its first day and 33,000 pageviews.”
Moving forward, Ryan anticipates that Usable Knowledge will continue to develop and bolster its content with more posts, blogs, and relevant information.
“We hope to include more education-based stories from across Harvard's campus," Ryan said. “There is significant work happening at other schools that we also plan to share with our audience.”

The field guide to marijuana culture at Harvard.
Throwback to 1963
Even Harvard’s ivory towers couldn’t keep out the 1960s. In the wake of the late lecturer Timothy Leary’s classroom experiments with LSD, the brave Crimson writer John Rupert wrote the article, “Marijuana In The Square: It Is Important to a Few.”
While marijuana was not overwhelmingly popular by any means, “still, a few local residents would agree with the young man who declared passionately, ‘I love pot.’” Apparently back in the day, marijuana was easy to come by, and “virtually anyone [could] easily pick up a nickel ($5) bag, which contains less than an ounce of marijuana.” All you need to do is “know someone who knows someone.”
Rupert writes that “the idea that smoking is an escape makes...sense. When a person is ‘high,’ good things may seem better, problems may seem less pressing, and he may derive pleasure and amusement from unexpected sources. One man said, ‘I'd like to stay high twenty-four hours a day, but I guess if I did, I'd never get anything done.’” Yeah, maybe.
Other students smoked to find more than just happiness: “Such people might find what they consider valuable experience in hitch-hiking to Peru, working on a garbage scow or sleeping with a Hottentot. Marijuana provides just one more piece of bric-a-brac for their emotional trophy case.”
Still, not everyone was smoking, as Rupert observed that “those who use marijuana include artists and writers, pseudo-artists and pseudo-writers, and frankly non-creative people. Both students and non-students belong. Outsiders can safely place many of these people in the romantic, if nebulous, image of "the Cambridge Underground." Some things never change.
2014: The Numbers
While there are no statistics about marijuana use from earlier periods in Harvard’s history, Rupert’s article states the drug was used only by a “small but dedicated” part of the community. The times have changed. Now, more incoming freshmen have tried cannabis than tobacco.
According to the recent Crimson freshman survey, 24.8% of freshmen have tried marijuana. That is a notable increase from the previous year, in which 21.8% of incoming freshman came into college having experimented with the drug.
While marijuana use may be on the rise, many more incoming freshmen, 64.6%, have tried alcohol. Tim Leary would be disappointed to know only 0.9% of the class of 2018 reports trying LSD.
The Policies and State Laws
Marijuana is banned at Harvard. As The Crimson has previously reported, however, Harvard’s policy on responding to smoking, particularly first time offenses, is vague. The policy states: “When cases involving drugs and alcohol come to the attention of the College, the College may take disciplinary action against a student, including requirement to withdraw.”
Marijuana is decriminalized in Massachusetts, meaning possession of one ounce of less is considered a civil offense. If you are caught with less than an ounce of marijuana, you are subject to a $100 fine and you get your weed taken away.
Massachusetts also allows for medicinal use of cannabis. Harvard, however, does not make an exception to its rules to accommodate medicinal marijuana use—don’t get any ideas.

Management consulting may not be the most meaningful job in the world. That probably didn’t come as a surprise, but here’s something that might: even years after that two-year stint at Bain Capital, around one third of Harvard graduates struggle to find meaning in their careers.
In a survey of 1.4 million college alumni conducted by PayScale, only 66 percent of Harvard alumni responded ‘yes’ to the question, “Does your work make the world a better place?”. While we managed to outpace our usual competitors Yale and Princeton (65 percent and 57 percent respectively), a school’s prestige correlates little on this scale with the amount of future job satisfaction its alumni find.
Higher hopes for career fulfillment come from practical, skill-driven majors one is hard-pressed to find in the Ivy League: medical fields, nursing, social work, and education, to name a few. The schools that produce the highest percentage of satisfied alumni aren’t the ones you’d usually find on the cover of U.S. News & World Report: Loma Linda University, University of Texas Medical Branch, and Thomas Jefferson University topped the list with 91 percent, 88 percent, and 86 percent of alumni responding ‘yes,’ respectively.
In many ways, this study seems to have simply confirmed what we all already knew: it’s hard to find an inspiring, meaningful profession that brings in enough Benjamins to support that luxury cruise to Saint-Tropez that you’ve always dreamed of. And for those with the means to climb the corporate ladder, the opportunity cost of “wasting” Ivy League cred on an unglamorous career in social work seems too high to pass up the chance. Last May, 30 percent of Harvard graduates with jobs upon graduation went into consulting and finance. Countless more have just begun or soon will enter law school to prepare for a career that is tied with fast food cook for least meaningful profession.
Apparently, while a liberal arts education has ostensibly prepared us to choose a meaningful life path, it’s also given us the flexibility to walk straight in the other direction. Unless, of course, you’re a biology concentrator hoping to make it in a “medical field.” If there’s one lesson to take from this, it’s that the pre-meds are onto something.
