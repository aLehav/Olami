Over 70 local vegan artisans lined the Reggie Lewis Athletic Center in Boston for the twenty-seventh annual Boston Veg Food Fest on Oct. 1-2. Showcasing food, fashion, and care products, the all-volunteer nonprofit Boston Vegetarian Society combined education with community empowerment to show the merits of a plant-based lifestyle.
“We here are at the forefront of plant-based eating with the longest running plant-based festival of 27 years. I love that it’s in this very diverse community because we want to make sure that folks who may not have as much access to plant based eating have this opportunity to see who offers it, resources, and materials to bring home,” said Jennifer D’Angelo, Humane Educator at Unity Farms. As a principal sponsor to the Boston Veg Food Fest, Unity Farms advocates centering plant-based lifestyles around animal kindness and rehabilitation away from farming.
The festival offered visitors the opportunity to learn from leaders in the plant-based industry including Jesse Isidor, Straus Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, Max H. Bazerman, Harvard Postdoc and CEO of Tender Food Christophe Cahntre, and Nirva Kapasi Patel, Harvard Law School Global policy Fellow in the Animal Law and Policy Program. Ten total speakers and panelists provided a wide range of perspectives on plant-based options within medicine, cooking, entrepreneurship, and storytelling.
Evelyn Kimber, who has served as President of the Boston Vegetarian Society for 25 years and been featured in Boston Magazine, organized the first iteration of Boston Veg Food Fest 27 years ago.
“The organizing committee has such a good time planning something that we feel has such a contribution to the world. We want people to think about food choices, their impact on the climate crisis, and on their health, so it all feels good and rewarding,” said Kimber. She hopes more people learn that a plant-based lifestyle is “fun and easy.”
While the Boston Veg Food Fest is the oldest running veg festival in the country, COVID impacted its ability to function normally.
“We didn’t know what to expect since this was our first in-person festival in three years due to COVID,” said Kimber. “We found in rounding up exhibitors that many are experiencing short staffing, and many could not have their businesses be open and be present at our event… But, we found that every exhibitor had such glowing events and sales since people were able to talk and connect.”
Even while operating at a post-pandemic scale, the festival still centered Boston and New England based artisans, chefs, and activists at the forefront of its programming. Lining the athletic center were rows of vendors selling products ranging from soaps, pastries, shirts, ready-made-meals, cook-books, coaching and advice, and more.
The diverse array of food highlighted the festival. Visitors could meander the stalls while the smell of sweets, stir-frys, and fried pakoras filled the air. One local entrepreneur, Kalpana Kethineedi, founder of Kay’s Curries, was exhibiting her new line of ready-to-cook meal kits featuring traditional Indian recipes. Kethineedi said that, as an emerging business, “We wanted to gain awareness and spread our product throughout Boston. My goal is to not just bring food, but bring awareness to real Indian food and names. We tell a story about where the dish is from.”
The Boston Veg Food Fest even hosted opportunities for visitors to make connections after the festival was over. One exhibit in particular is paving the way for vegans/vegetarians to build community. Vegpal, “the Bumble for vegans,” is an online dating, friendship, and networking app that allows plant-based eaters to connect around the world. Founder Dahlia Eisenberg said, “I have had so many people come up to this table and say, ‘Oh my god, this exists? I didn’t know there was a way to connect with other vegans.’ An app is an easy way to facilitate those one-on-one connections.”
From its volunteers to its continued supporters, it is the community that keeps the Boston Veg Fest running. Two visitors, Sahara Truth and Elle Tillery, have been coming to the festival for the past five years. “We’ve been coming to check out what’s new in the vegan community,” said Truth, since the festival shares new recipes, restaurants, and vendors in the Boston area.
The festival also provided a space for university students to come together with the Boston community. Kira DeSalvo, a third year at Northeastern, said “It’s awesome because it makes it accessible…it helps people come together, share ideas, and gain experience for free.” Marisol Pacheco, another Northeastern student, said, “There’s a lot of diversity, tons of different populations represented united under one event.”
Five-year volunteer Raj Melkote reflected on the growing visibility the Boston plant-based community has amassed in the past few years. Instead of being on the outskirts of Boston’s culture, the Boston Food Festival has become mainstream and garnered attention from around the country. He said, “We had Boston City Council Woman Julia Mejia here yesterday…It’s a tangible means of showing support without donations.”
The Boston Veg Food Fest is bridging the knowledge and accessibility gap to a plant-based lifestyle. Organizer of the festival and Assistant Director of Harvard’s Office for Sustainability David Havelick said, “Our audience is not just vegans and vegetarians. The whole point of this is to invite people who may not otherwise try these foods to come by.”
Kimber said, “People come to the festival out of curiosity, and it changes their lives. I feel like I’m making a small contribution to make this a better world.”
The Boston Veg Food Fest has made a substantial impact for local businesses and become a staple tradition for the plant-based community in New England. With the festival’s vibrant and diverse atmosphere, vegetarians, vegans, and non-restricted eaters alike are welcome to find their new favorite plant-based product and meet passionate sustainability, climate, and animal-rights advocates.

In his feature directorial debut “See How They Run,” Tom George delivers a new take on the Agatha Christie locked-room mystery. The film unleashes its glitzy cast on the streets of 1950s London, where they clash over the fate of a long-running West End stage production, extramarital dalliances, and the mysterious death of Hollywood director Leo Köpernick (Adrien Brody). The result is a funny, stylish, but ultimately unsatisfying whodunit that glitters with Wes Anderson-esque visuals but struggles to stir up suspense, losing resonance in its last act.
Starting with the film’s premise itself, “See How They Run” layers together real-life history, made-up mystery, and satire, drawing inspiration from Agatha Christie’s stage play “The Mousetrap.” That real-life play ran from 1952 to 2020 and was the longest-running West End play of all time. The film revolves around a fictional production of “The Mousetrap” starring hot-shot actor Dickie Attenborough (Harris Dickinson) and his wife Sheila Sim (Pearl Chanda), and it opens on the night of the play’s 100th performance. As the cast and their benefactors ring in the occasion, Köpernick butts heads with Attenborough and argues with playwright Mervyn Cocker-Norris (David Oyelowo). Of course, nobody seems that shocked when he turns up dead backstage, kicking off a chaotic murder investigation led by Inspector Stoppard (Sam Rockwell) and Constable Stalker (Saoirse Ronan).
Over the course of the film, Stoppard and Stalker track their suspects around the city, popping in and out of theaters, pubs, posh 1950s offices, and lush apartments. The spaces are all outfitted with a visual decadence and symmetry that will ring familiar to Wes Anderson fans (a parallel deepened by George’s frequent whip-pans, which give the whole film a “Grand Budapest Hotel” gloss.) As the detectives interview potential suspects, a clearer picture of an anarchic theater, failing film adaptation, and constant creative conflicts emerge — all overshadowed by the looming personality of Agatha Christie herself.
Though much of the film unfolds in interviews, stakeouts, and quirky police work sequences, most of the real revelations in the case come from flashbacks, which are spliced throughout. Though the flashbacks are quick-moving and prettily-staged, they untether the narrative from time and place to confusing effect. As the narrative jumps back and forth in time, the tight-wire tension that drives the mystery fades, relaxing into a general atmosphere of catty dysfunction with a few false leads and empty clues. While the film’s conceit of building out the locked-room thriller and bringing the characters into the real world works initially, the film struggles to maintain suspense without a contained environment. There aren’t enough consistent interactions between its eclectic characters to showcase the film’s stellar cast, and the potential villains rarely embody the sinister shiftiness they’re supposed to.
While suspicion shifts to several different characters over the course of the film, their motives are rarely surprising, and the beats of the mystery feel flat as the finale nears. The film shines more in its humor than its suspense, mining self-aware comedy from its characters’ antics, from Köpernick and Cocker-Norris’s arguments over the literary value of flashbacks to Stalker’s propensity to jump to conclusions.
In true Christie style, the film is animated by a cast of eccentric, slightly unbelievable characters, from the conniving theater owner Petula Spencer (Ruth Wilson) to the sleazy film producer John Woolf (Reece Shearsmith) and his uptight wife Edana (Sian Clifford). The ensemble cast delivers solid, often funny performances and easy chemistry across the board, giving fight scenes and interrogations a needed spark. Ronan and Rockwell work well together as an unlikely duo, with Stoppard’s alcoholic jadedness compleimenting Stalker’s bright-eyed eagerness. Ronan in particular is a comedic standout in the cast, perfectly toeing the line between earnest dedication and sharp-eyed skepticism.
The film also benefits from charming production design by Amanda McArthur and neat cinematography by Jamie Ramsay (whose muted, lush visuals are also on display in recent release “Mothering Sunday”). Together, they give the film a storybook edge and lightens its tone even as Stoppard’s alcoholism and the theater’s bleak prospects threaten to break the spell.
Altogether, though, the film’s charms feel superficial — at the heart of the story is a mystery that often feels muddled and mundane, leading to an anticlimactic finish. Christie’s novels draw tension and momentum from well-drawn characters with complex backstories and motives, but the film fails to replicate that depth. The breadth and quirkiness of the movie’s ensemble comes at the cost of real character exploration, preventing the viewer from truly connecting with the characters or caring about their fates. Overall, one gets a sense that their conflicts would play out more interestingly in the types of tense, contained environments that Christie is known for, rather than the cutesy midcentury city conjured in the film.

The rise of social media has paved the way for the rise (and fall) of endless viral food trends across the internet. With many of these originating as Youtube, Instagram, and Tiktok food videos reach peak popularity, these trends are ever evolving reflections of pop culture. While some sound genuinely delicious and may have changed appetites for the better, the vast majority are more than questionable. Below, we revisit some of the internet’s most memorable food trends.
Challenge Trends
The Cinnamon Challenge: This challenge went viral in 2011, encouraging people to try their best to eat an entire spoonful of cinnamon in under a minute. More often than not, the participant either choked on the cinnamon or spit out a messy brown cloud. The danger of this trend is something that internet culture has attempted to recreate time and again. It goes without saying that no matter how much of a cinnamon lover you are, you should not try this trend at home.
Spicy foods: The trend of eating spicy peppers on the internet peaked in 2012 but continues to reappear every few years. Starting with the “Ghost Pepper Challenge'' but even working up to the Carolina Reaper, individuals pushed their level of spice tolerance in extreme and dangerous ways. Spicy foods in media are still extremely mainstream, with artisan hot sauces still being in the limelight of food culture and youtube series such as “Hot Ones” still raking in millions of views with each video.
Honorable mentions include the more dangerous saltine challenge, sprite and banana challenge, and the harrowing Tide-Pod challenge,
Healthy (Green) Trends
Avocado everything: It is no surprise that avocado made it onto this list. With a need to put avocado on seemingly everything, millennials in particular defined this trend (particularly with the rise of avocado toast as a 21st century breakfast staple).
Açai bowls: These bowls have become a representation of peak health for the self branded “gurus” of the internet. Typically consisting of a blended açai berry base, topped with bananas, strawberries, blueberries, and granola, the appeal of these bowls of sugar is obvious.
Honorable mentions for this category include chia seed everything, kale, kombucha, and fermented foods in general.
Trends within the last month
Corn: The corn kid has taken the internet by storm. A viral sensation complete with songs and interviews, the endearing nature of the corn kid has encouraged many to find the simple beauty in a food that so many take for granted.
Butter Boards: Essentially glorified sticks of butter, smeared across a board, and topped with beautiful seasonings, vegetables, fruits, and more. This brand new iteration of charcuterie boards began with TikTok user Justine_Snacks and has prompted everything from bagel boards to seafood spinoffs.
NyQuil Chicken: Even the attention of the FDA can’t get the internet to leave the dangerous food trends that it loves in the past. The NyQuil chicken is what it sounds like: a large chunk of chicken cooked in a very dangerous amount of cold medicine. This one should be avoided for obvious reasons.
Coffee trends
Pumpkin spice everything: With a culture in love with Starbucks, many cafe-related trends rely on its marketing at the time. The pumpkin spiced latte is no different. With a reliable consistency, it is almost guaranteed that autumn consumers will easily find massive arrays of pumpkin flavored pastries, treats, and of course, the drink itself.
Whipped dalgona coffee: Consisting purely of sugar, hot water, and instant coffee, this is one of the trends from this list that readers are more likely to have tried themselves. Generally, this is then placed on top of a glass of iced milk to create a deliciously refreshing beverage.
Honorable mentions that continue to fuel this caffeine addicted section include the internet’s rendition of the Starbucks pink drink, matcha, and the rise of cold brew.
Pastry trends
Rainbow bagel: Rainbow pastries rose to their peak of fame in 2016. Inspiring rainbow related feelings of joy and happiness, this trend really took off with the virality of the rainbow bagel being sold by the New York City Bagel Bakery. These bagels inspired a wave of rainbow foods such as the rainbow grilled cheese.
Japanese cheesecake: Loved for its fluffiness and jiggly nature, Japanese cheesecake took the U.S. by storm. Created by whisking the egg whites separately before incorporating them into the mixture, this rich, sweet, eggy treat deserves the love it receives.
Video content on the internet has truly changed how we consume food as a society. This trip down memory lane reveals just how quickly these trends come and go. It’s easy to see many of these as ridiculous, unnecessary, or downright dangerous in hindsight; however, the cultural fascination that they have created will likely persist.

Constance Wu is not afraid of embarrassment, and that is the greatest strength of her debut essay collection “Making a Scene.” The “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Fresh Off the Boat” actress does not hold back as she shares stories set from her small-town childhood in Virginia to the bright lights of New York and Los Angeles. In doing so, she invites the reader backstage to learn about her life beyond the screen.
Wu’s strongest essays delve into the ambiguity of issues and share both flattering and unflattering parts of her honest self. In “Welcome to Jurassic Park,” she proposes reclaiming Asian stereotypes in media by reframing stereotypical traits as worthy of celebration rather than suppression: “When our reactivity to old wounds renders us ashamed to the point of objection or repudiation, it reinforces the mainstream’s ignorant theory that the people who embody those stereotypes are inherently shameful,” she writes. Likewise, in “Unfinished Mansions,” Wu gives a tribute to her parents that doesn’t hide the fraught and messy relationships that make up her family; it instead chronicles her parents’ story — one that certainly is a far cry from Rachel and Nick’s cookie-cutter fairytale in “Crazy Rich Asians”— and acknowledges the complexity of real life compared with life on the television screen: “Everybody wants it in a sound bite. But the story of my mom doesn’t fit in a sound bite.”
Wu writes in simple, clear prose, which is both her greatest strength and weakness. At times, Wu’s writing feels a bit immature: In “Impeach the President,” she says of her friend, “She knows about all of my boyfriends. All their dick sizes too (sorry, guyyyys).” Perhaps the charm of the book is that these embarrassing anecdotes and occasionally juvenile writing style are an integral part of expressing the “big feelings” that Wu strives to embrace, but at times it feels overdone.
Beneath it all, we get to see the value that performance holds in Wu’s life. It serves as a way for her to stand out; a particularly hilarious anecdote comes when she recounts her audition as Sara Crewe in a community theater production of “A Little Princess.” (“I went full-on Sally Field crying over Julia Roberts’s death in “Steel Magnolias.” I made a goddamn scene of it.”) She briefly touches on the importance of performance in society in “Exploring an Orange,” in which she recounts how her examination of an orange during an acting class led to a reflection on the interconnectedness of life: “This orange, and the opportunity to explore it. What a privilege to be an actor, to examine life in this way.”
On the whole, though, “Making a Scene” is about acknowledging the less-than-savory parts of oneself and knowing that they’re still a part of one’s story and that it is okay to miss them. Wu addresses the cynical reality of the entertainment industry and laments the scorn that overblown emotions often elicits from others. “Outside the bubble of community theater, the world often mocks sincerity and commitment — especially in Hollywood.” Yet, Wu is not afraid to acknowledge that these big feelings, though valid and freeing, are not always good; she explores her childhood jealousy of her younger sister and how she lashes out because of these feelings.
Perhaps most damning of all, though, Wu shows how society’s pressure to suppress big feelings can lead to very real, very deadly consequences, by sharing her own account of rape and sexual harassment. She provides a sobering reality that is punctuated by the simple, frank tone of her book. Her refusal to not simply relate events, but also focus on examining various perspectives and acknowledging the thorns and ambiguities of current societal issues adds an additional layer of honesty to her account. She shares her own perspective, too, on why women are often so scared to accuse men of sexual harassment: “Her claim is filled with shame and guilt and regret over the things she didn’t say or do in the moment, for fear of making a scene.”
Ultimately, the premise of the book can be found in its very title. “Making a Scene” comes from a woman unafraid to stand up for herself and, if not necessarily embrace, acknowledge the flaws of her younger self. Wu makes the choice to own her stories, and anyone who reads “Making a Scene” will surely feel inspired to do the same.

Sandra Cisneros is a legend in Chicanx literature, with a career that has spanned more than 40 years. Her latest work, “Woman Without Shame,” is her first new collection of poetry in 28 years, and it is a brazen triumph.
Cisneros is best known for her 1984 novel “The House on Mango Street” — a fact she pointedly mentions in the acknowledgements of her new collection, writing, “It seems the success of my fiction in my lifetime has overshadowed the fact that I was once a poet. I still am.” Yes, Sandra Cisneros is still a poet, and she’s determined not to let us forget it. She writes in plain free verse, without excessive ornamentation, which works to the collection’s benefit. Her poetry is candid, often humorous, and, as the title suggests, utterly shameless.
Split into five sections, “Woman Without Shame” demonstrates Cisneros’s ability to navigate a wide range of subjects and styles with ease. The three-line “Swallows, Guanajuato Airport,” a snapshot of birds flying inside an airport, can be recited within a single breath. In contrast, the magnificent “You Better Not Put Me in a Poem” is a twelve-page reflection on Cisneros’s lengthy list of past lovers. Cisneros flows through this astonishing variety of poems with dexterity, moving skillfully from topics of aging to politics to sex.
At 67 years old, Cisneros writes frankly about aging with refreshing lightness and humor, forgoing any self-pity to celebrate her own aging body. In “At Fifty, I Am Startled to Find I Am in My Splendor,” she writes, “Passé? I am but vintage.” And in “Funny Bone,” Cisneros pokes fun at her own joints with an amusing riff on William Carlos Williams’s “The Red Wheelbarrow”: “So much depends / Upon a staircase / Glazed with / Rainwater / Seven / Years / Ago.” One can imagine her laughing as she writes these poems, appreciating her own smile lines.
The poems in “Woman Without Shame” seamlessly blend Spanish and English, allowing each poem to speak naturally in whichever language best conveys its message. Cisneros has also included three poems written entirely in Spanish, each followed by an English translation. This trinity of poems — “Cielo con sombrero,” “Cielo sin sombrero,” and “Quiero ser maguey en mi próxima vida” — compose some of the collection’s strongest work, holding gravity in both languages. Also deserving of a mention is the brilliant “Te A—,” a vividly written poem about teenage lovers interrupted in the middle of graffiting the words “te amo” on a wall.
Cisneros’s poetry doesn’t shy away from politics, both in the United States and in Mexico. The poem “El Hombre,” dedicated to the late Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo, comments on violence, poverty, and crime in Mexico and the United States, each stanza punctuated by the line “Mándanos luz. Send us all light.” Like the rest of the collection, Cisneros’s political commentary is wry and unflinching. In “God Breaks the Heart Again and Again Until It Stays Open,” Cisneros questions the poem’s title, asking, “But what if my heart is a chupacabrón chanting, ‘Build the wall!’?”
Throughout the collection, Cisneros writes openly about her sex life, destigmatizing female desire and finding love in one’s old age. But it’s in “Cisneros sin censura,” the penultimate section, where Cisneros truly lets loose. In poems such as “Variations in White” and “My Mother and Sex,” she approaches sexuality with frankness and undiluted appreciation, from writing on intimacy with a lover to her mother’s ironic discomfort around the topic of sex. The crowning achievement of this section is “You Better Not Put Me in a Poem,” the longest work in the collection and written exquisitely as a series of anecdotes about the men in her previous relationships. Unapologetic about the poem’s length and content, she writes, “I was/am/always will be a romantic.”
“Woman Without Shame” marks Cisneros’s revelatory return to the world of poetry. Through this collection, Cisneros openly celebrates that which society has deemed taboo — her aging body, her bilingualism, her personal connection to Mexico, and her sexuality. And these poems are most clear about one thing: These fundamentally human experiences are nothing to be ashamed of.

Returning to a galaxy far, far away once again, “Andor” plants the seeds of the beloved Rebellion that has captured audiences’ imaginations since May 1977. The first episode of the newest addition to the well-known franchise premiered on Sept. 21 on Disney+. Since Disney’s acquisition of “Stars Wars” in 2012, the franchise has struggled to find the right balance between telling new stories and relying on its established mythos. “Andor” seeks to right the scales and offer a compelling story that dovetails with the movies.
The show ties directly into the 2016 film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” one of Disney’s first forays into the “Star Wars” universe. “Rogue One”’s story focused on the Rebel Alliance’s acquisition of the plans for the Empire’s super weapon, events that catalyze the action of Lucas’s original 1977 film. “Rogue One” introduced audiences to characters like Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), Rebel spies who sacrifice their lives for the greater good of the galaxy. Reception of the film was mixed; it earned less than anticipated at the box office but garnered positive reviews from critics, who praised its adherence to the source material. In the time since its theatrical release, it has grown more popular among fans, especially against the shaky track record of Disney’s other “Star Wars” offerings.
The new series is set years before “Rogue One” and further develops the backstory of Cassian Andor, with Diego Luna reprising his role as the titular character. From the outset, “Andor” strives to both illuminate a new side of the galaxy and to appeal to fans of George Lucas’s original film trilogy. The title card hearkens back to the wide space shots of “A New Hope”’s opening scene, but after that, the series immediately sets about establishing its own distinctive style. The show’s first episode mixes neo-noir aesthetics with spy thriller story beats to create a wholly new atmosphere amongst the “Star Wars” canon. This unique visual presentation grounds the story’s exploration of several complex themes including responsibility, guilt, and whether the ends justify the means.
The show depends on its titular character to grapple with these questions. Cassian Andor’s moral ambiguity is a welcome departure from the binary good-versus-evil narratives that have dominated “Star Wars” since Disney’s takeover. Many of the complaints leveled at Disney’s sequel trilogy focused on poor characterization and development, but “Andor” largely avoids that issue, creating a hero that defies flat stereotypes.
Throughout the premiere, Cassian grapples with the consequences of his actions. In one particularly well-acted scene, Luna conveys the inner turmoil Cassian feels through a series of facial expressions before he decides to kill someone threatening his anonymity. The strain of the decision and Cassian’s guilt are both evident, demonstrating Luna’s impressive range and control. His performance largely carries the first episode, giving audiences a sketch of a rougher, more aimless Andor than in “Rogue One”.
The show stumbles a bit, however, with its other characters. The introduction of another droid sidekick and strange alien animals feel like tropes for “Star Wars,” and “Andor” has both. Andor’s droid sidekick, B2EMO — an innocent and naive salvage droid — clearly emulates both R2-D2 and BB-8. While Andor seems to care about the droid, B2EMO adds little to the story that Andor’s other allies, namely Bix and Brasso, do not. Meanwhile, the hounds roaming the planet Ferrix might as well be scenery. Their inclusion seems to be Disney’s attempt to continue merchandising the lucrative franchise. Fortunately, their inclusion does not distract from the story.
More concerning is the characterization of the show’s antagonist, Syril Karn. A corporate underling whose ambition directly clashes with his robotic adherence to the rules, Karn’s villainy is underbaked. His desire to do what he views as right complicates his status as the enemy, but a lack of nuanced motives undermine audience sympathy. In addition, the show so far has not illustrated what power he actually possesses to endanger the hero, so his relentlessness comes off as an empty threat. Hopefully, the rest of the season explores more of his motivation and creates a compelling foil to Andor.
Despite these minor criticisms, the show as a whole appears poised for success. Audience members who have seen “Rogue One” know where Cassian’s story will end, but this new series offers compelling hints toward how he became the selfless Rebel spy they know. For more casual fans, the central mystery of the story, alluded to in flashbacks throughout the premiere, will likely draw them into wanting more.
Much as how “The Mandalorian” — Disney’s other major “Star Wars” success — used the trappings of the galaxy far, far away to tell a new story, “Andor” explores a different side of the universe without abandoning the themes of Lucas’s vision that continue to resonate with audiences today. The “Andor” premiere succeeds in charting its own path into the gray underworld from which our protagonist and the Rebellion emerge.

On Friday, Sept. 30, Beacon Hill Books and Cafe opened on Boston’s famed Charles Street. It is the first new bookstore to open in the neighborhood in nearly 30 years. A visit to the bookstore on its opening day revealed that it seeks to be more than just a regular business, curated and decorated with magic in mind.
Only one hour after opening, the store was abuzz with customers exploring its nooks and crannies. Children inspected the books, patrons chatted with the staff, and many posed for selfies in front of photogenic displays.
It’s clear that every inch of the space was meticulously designed. The first and second floors give the impression of being a tailored apartment more than a retail space. Towering bookcases painted in pale blue line the walls and tables display catered selections of novels. Fresh flowers adorn the mantle of a crackling fireplace. Scattered throughout the store are small chairs that invite patrons to sit and start a book.
The third floor, dedicated to children and young adult readers, seems to draw the most attention from visitors. A gleaming red button rests on the wall with the words “PRESS ME.” When one obliges, a steam engine whistles to life and appears atop the bookshelves. A tiny squirrel — Paige, the store’s mascot — sits in the conductor’s car. Beside the fire, tiny chairs surround a miniature tea set. Nearby, a small child-sized door with a gold knocker invites young visitors to walk through and peruse the books.
The magical qualities of the store were apparent to its visitors. Two customers browsing amongst the shelves, Nikki Stone and Kass Aitken, commented on their experience in the store. “It’s so cute!” said Stone.
Aitken compared entering the store to “an ‘Alice in Wonderland’ experience. Walking in that door from the street was pleasantly delightful,” Aitken said. It indeed feels like entering a new world, engineered to entice.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the store’s owner, Melissa Fetter, revealed the inspiration behind its design: “I worked with wonderful architects, local architects — Pauli & Uribe Associate Architects — and an interior designer named Cathy Kincaid, and then I have a great passion for aesthetics and interiors,” said Fetter. “I think retail businesses that thrive in this day thrive because you make the space so compelling that people will choose to come into the store to make the purchase, rather than do what is more convenient and order online from that company whose name must not be mentioned. You have to make it really fun for people to come in. And so that's what we've done.”
Fetter is new to the world of running a small business, but she is confident that her background gives her the experience necessary to make Beacon Hill Books and Cafe work.
“I worked at JPMorgan for many years and then spent 20 years doing a lot of philanthropic work chairing different art museum boards, you know, very active in the community,” she said. “But somehow all of those experiences come together in a way that I feel prepares me to be a small business operator. And because I don't have a background in retailing or bookselling, it means that I've been able to approach everything with very fresh eyes and look at it through the view of the consumer.”
The space promises to be a source of attraction for tourists in the city, and locals are just as excited about the opening of a new business. One resident, Erin Buechele, said, “I live right down the street, and every single day when I walk down Charles I peek in, and I’m just thrilled. I love independent bookstores and I think that everyone should support them. And, I’m excited for the cafe to open.”
The cafe that Buechele mentions will soon be open for breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea. Fetter estimates that the space will be ready within a couple of weeks.
Although the bookstore and cafe are located in Beacon Hill, Fetter made it clear that it is a space for both those in and outside of the neighborhood:
“This is a bookstore for all of Boston and for people traveling to Boston. Our curation of books and the programming that we will offer are inclusive and welcoming of everyone,” she said. “And I hope that your readers will find that we’re a good excuse to come across town to enjoy all that Beacon Hill and the neighboring area have to offer.”
The store offers a space for students looking to enjoy books in a comfortable atmosphere, too. Fetter hopes that it will rekindle the magical experience that reading can bring.
“I want to inspire a lifelong love of reading. I think it's so critically important. And I think we can kind of do that: We can make it fun, we can let people in, and then they can find out on their own. What a gift it is to read,” she said.
Beacon Hill Books and Cafe is located at 71 Charles Street. When its cafe officially opens, it will be announced on the store’s Instagram page, @beaconhillbooksandcafe.

“Oh my God, they’re in this movie too?”
Audiences will surely find themselves asking this question many times over the course of David O. Russell’s new murder-mystery film “Amsterdam.” But when not blinded by the combined lights of Margot Robbie, Christian Bale, John David Washington, Robert De Niro, Taylor Swift, Anya Tayor-Joy, and more, viewers will quickly realize that they are watching a rather clumsy project. Abandoning the swaggering style of “American Hustle” and the understated beauty of “Silver Linings Playbook,” Russell instead opts for a true-story crime caper with uneven humor and questionable logic.
Certain aspects of the film do lift it safely out of the realm of total disaster, the most noticeable being the rich production design. Ironically, most of “Amsterdam” takes place in 1930s New York City, a setting that provides ample opportunity for beautiful shots of the industrializing city’s crowded streets, the interiors of old-money establishments, and sundry antique cars. Paired with excellent period-specific costumes — especially Robbie’s striking golden dress in the final act — the film easily manages to delight the eyes of the audience from start to finish.
Surprisingly, the allure of “Amsterdam’”s aforementioned star-studded cast remains fresh and palpable throughout the film. Unlike Adam McKay’s “Don’t Look Up,” which did little to free itself of the inherently gimmicky nature of its star-studded cast, “Amsterdam” succeeds in making most of the high-profile additions to the story feel like integral parts of the plot instead of mere cameos. (Swifties be warned, however, as Taylor Swift is a notable exception to this statement, only given a brief opportunity at the film’s beginning to flout her genius).
Taylor-Joy is an unsurprising standout, capturing her character’s graceful petulance with ever-so-subtle humor and an undeniable allure. Watching this new star hold her own next to a great like Robert De Niro is more enjoyable than anything the film has to offer by way of its story. However, it is Christian Bale who does most of the heavy lifting in the film, serving as its nerdy, quick-witted protagonist Burt whose glass eye commands far too much screen time. While Bale does his damnedest to breathe some life into Russell’s unengaging and oddly didactic script, his admirable efforts are ultimately in vain, as the film provides audiences with very little reason to care about Burt’s outlandish exploits. Finding a way to misuse the talents of Bale (as well as Robbie) is quite a feat, but “Amsterdam” does just that, leaving viewers with the upsetting impression that these lead actors were mostly invested in collecting a paycheck.
Such an issue is largely the fault of the film’s remarkably sloppy plot. From the very first scene, “Amsterdam” struggles to establish its stakes, with it being rather unclear why the two mysterious murders that set the plot into motion are pertinent to the main characters. The film mostly ambles from location to location at the urging of the next major celebrity, trying to keep audiences engaged by constantly making vague references to the shocking, unthinkable evil forces behind all of the mayhem. By the time Bale and company uncover the eye roll-inducing truth, far too much of the movie has passed and the excitement of the final act feels truncated. Moreover, the film’s inability to outline the logic leading to this discovery means it has to rely heavily on a Scooby-Doo-esque explanation in the story’s final moments, an obvious indication of a poorly-written script.
The more glaring deficiency of the screenplay is its sugar-sweet moralizing that Russell decides to shoehorn throughout the film’s action. Robbie and Washington’s reflections on the poetic nature of love in the titular city are basic yet bearable, but Bale’s impossibly long soliloquy on the battle of “love versus hate” at the film’s conclusion comes dangerously close to sinking the whole enterprise. In a movie that audiences are led to believe is a murder mystery, Russell includes a misplaced reminder to love your neighbor that is heavy-handed enough to leave viewers with a concussion.
“Amsterdam” is not a great movie. For the most part, it feels like an off-brand Wes Anderson project that cannot decide exactly what it means to be. There is, however, some fun to be had in watching many of the superstars of modern Hollywood don pretty costumes and travel between even prettier sets. It simply would have been far more fun to witness such giants do these things within the context of a great story.

A man rinses a knife in the kitchen sink. His figure is obscured, suffocated in a dim, rotting yellow light. As he rinses, deep burgundy drips off the blade and into the sink. His rumpled, plain t-shirt is the focus as he smokes a cigarette and drinks a beer, crumpling the can and tossing it into the basin. His face is always just out of view and his form deliberately blocked: the viewer seems to be hiding undetected from the man onscreen. This ominous opening of “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” sets the tone of lurid intrigue for the rest of the show, holding viewers captive by the show’s “can’t look away” factor.
Creators Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy aren’t ones to shy away from gritty, gory details of the macabre, as fans of Murphy’s “American Horror Story” can attest. In this new limited series, the pair set out to illuminate the motives, process, and crimes of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Throughout the season, the viewer is taken into the heart of the crimes and mind of the criminal — from the murders, to prison.
From the first scenes of episode one, the show uncomfortably immerses the viewer into every last detail of Jeffrey Dahmer’s world. While disturbingly effective at satiating the morbid curiosity that draws certain viewers to the story of a killer, the repetition of Dahmer’s cycle of killing in the first half of the show introduces a gratuitous level of gruesome detail. In the process, victims are reduced to their proximity to Dahmer as Brennan and Murphy side-step any thoughtful portrayals of their identities outside of the atrocities the show depicts.
The show’s strongest points lie in its ability to create and sustain tension that keeps the viewer engaged and on-edge throughout. Evan Peters lives up to expectations in playing Jeffrey Dahmer as he expertly mimics the killer’s eerie mannerisms. Peters emulates the muffled, apathetic cadence distinct to his character impressively well, and the juxtaposition of Dahmer’s awkward uncertainty in manner with his adeptness at killing is enough to inspire a queasy shudder in even the most avid of horror fans.
With few breaks from the story’s suspenseful intensity, however, the viewer soon tires of experiencing the harrowing scenes seemingly first-hand. The entropic bareness of Dahmer’s apartment, designed as an exact replica of the real setting of the murders, adds to the uncomfortably immersive experience. The viewer is plunged into the stifling, hazy decay of Dahmer’s world, the stench of his crimes seeming to ooze from the screen.
Starting with the escape of Dahmer’s final target, the first episode emphatically points to the intensity of Dahmer’s evil impulses which had been solidified with each act of violence. The next four episodes seek to answer the question that immediately bubbles to the surface of the viewer’s mind: “How did he get to this point?” Tracing the murderer’s upbringing and tallying Dahmer’s victim count, the show repeatedly walks the viewer through the cycle of killing. The portrayal of the instability of Dahmer’s childhood seeks to contextualize the hurricane that lands with his first kill and continues to wreak havoc with each subsequent murder.
However, the focus on Dahmer through a repeated viewing of his process of luring targets from gay bars doesn’t accomplish as comprehensive of a narrative as was intended. The redundancy of the illustration of Dahmer’s out of control loop rather insensitively demeans the victims through their pain as merely one among a host of other depicted murders.
Most of us are comfortable with a virtual barrier separating our minds from the mind of a killer like Jeffrey Dahmer. “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” seeks to shock the viewer into attention by toppling this barrier. Unfortunately, the force-fed macabre details render each episode challenging and unnecessarily disturbing to watch despite its strengths in providing piercing close insight into Dahmer’s life.

At this point in the semester, most students are buckling down and thinking of nothing more than surviving the next exam. But even with midterms in full swing, the cast and crew members of “In the Heights” are spending hours practicing in Loeb Drama Center every evening. And now, just six weeks after the start of the term, TEATRO! — Harvard’s Latinx performing arts organization — is almost ready for the premiere of the musical originally written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.
This quick turnaround is no small feat. Callia H. Chuang ’23, one of three co-choreographers, described the quick turnaround as one of the fastest timelines in recent Harvard memory. Chuang felt that given the considerable amount of dance numbers, the choreographers in particular were under huge pressure. Because of this, as co-choreographer Jennifer Chu ’24 explained, the team actually started “planning and making choreo[graphy] in the summer.”
Still, the choreographers remained flexible. “After we got back on campus, I think we were all really inspired by the cast members,” Chu said, “Because we knew that things would change. And leaving more room for play actually allowed us to take more inspiration from the people we cast and bring their personalities and their energy into our movement.”
The choreographers were not the only crewmembers who felt the pressure of the quick turnaround. Many of the performers, who were not cast until this semester, have also devoted extra time to the show. “I realized a lot of it was on me to just read through the script, go through the music myself, and create my own relationship [to the character] before being told by the director,” said Diego Flores Romero ’23, who plays the lead character Usnavi.
Yet this pressure has not prevented the “In the Heights” cast and crew from enjoying the production. “[Rehearsals are] something I really look forward to every day which has made it a lot easier,” said Roseanne O. Strategos ’25, who plays questioning college student Nina. “I really think that everyone’s putting a lot of work into this show which has made it go a lot smoother.”
Isabella E. Peña ‘24, cast as Vanessa, an aspiring fashion designer and Usnavi’s love interest, agreed that the hard work of the team has made the time crunch more manageable and enjoyable. “Any given day, we’re rehearsing sometime between 5 and 11 P.M., so I’m getting to know the cast really well and getting to know the directing team and the choreographers really well which is fun,” she said.
The tight turnaround didn’t prevent Director Aviva L.F. Ramirez ’23 from pursuing her goal of increasing Latine representation within Harvard’s theater scene, either. “When I was a first-year starting out in the theater community here, there really wasn’t a lot of Latine representation in terms of people going on stage and of people running shows and I didn't see any large musicals produced by or about Hispanic people,” she said.
To Ramirez, “In the Heights” is also a chance for greater Latine visibility within musical theater as a whole. “In the Heights is the gold standard of Latine representation in musical theater. There really isn't another show that does it like ‘Heights.’ … there isn’t any part of the musical theater canon that engages with Latine representation, identities, and experiences the way that ‘Heights’ does,” she said. Because of this, Ramirez is hopeful that “people feel seen” by the show.
Ramirez has also set out to rectify what she believes are mistakes made by the movie adaptation of “In the Heights.” Like many critics of director Jon M. Chu’s version, Ramirez finds that the full range of what it can mean to be a Latine person in terms of skin tone and experience was missing from the film. She was especially concerned that the movie failed to grapple with the conflict surrounding Nina and Benny’s relationship arising from Benny’s race and the colorism in Nina’s family.
“I find it very important that there’s this story of colorism and racism even within communities of color,” Ramirez said, “yet it was totally erased in the movie. There was no mention of [Nina’s father] having any sort of prejudice against Benny.” On top of including this dynamic in TEATRO!’s production, Ramirez sought to “deepen that storyline” by genderbending Benny’s character, who will be played by Alyssa M. Gaines ’26. “Not only is it a story of tension between Nina’s Puerto Rican family and Benny as an African American, but it’s also a queer story between two young women,” she said.
The crewmembers were unmistakably excited about next week’s performance. Flores Romero was particularly eager to see his parents in the audience. “I’ve done musicals before, but I don’t think [my parents] have been able to come before due to the language barrier. I’m hoping they’ll understand ‘In the Heights’ more,” she said.

As fall winds struck Cambridge last weekend, one attraction brought warmth to an otherwise cold day: the Harvard Square Open Market. Located on Church Street, the market runs weekly on Sundays through Oct. 30, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and features the shops of dozens of local Boston-area artists, curators, and business owners with a vast range of products from posters to plants to secondhand clothes.
The market is a result of the Harvard Square Business Association’s partnership with New England Open Markets and offers an opportunity for small businesses that may not otherwise have the option to sell goods in person to reach a larger client base.
“I don’t have a physical store,” said Ariana LaMotte, owner of Ariana Thrifts. “I’ve been selling at the New England Open Markets all summer — just popping up here and there.”
Artist Amy Hartigan also appreciates the market for letting her explore a burgeoning hobby.
“My main hustle was that I owned a consulting company doing marketing and PR, but then I started painting so now I’m hoping my side hustle becomes my main hustle,” she said.
Even business owners with brick-and-mortar locations can benefit from the open market. Bob Perry, for example, runs the market stand for Cheapo Records, which also has a location in Central Square.
“The store and the market go hand in hand — the store is always open and markets create a new location every weekend,” Perry said. “It’s like having two stores on a Sunday.”
Even young people have gotten involved in the vendor community. Boy Scouts Richard Zaloom and Alex Saba from Troop 194 sold popcorn at the market.
“We’ve never tried going out of our hometown of Bedford. But we decided that since we know a few people who work in this area, we would set up at the market and see how well we could do,” Zaloom said.
“And so far we’re doing really well!” Saba said with a nod, noting that they also ran into a former member of their troop as they were selling that day.
Supporting members of the community is at the core of the market’s mission. Cellist Keefer Glenshaw studies at the Berklee College of Music and busks at the open market every week, where passersby can enjoy his music.
“There have been a couple times where my money has fully blown away and people have had the kindness to pick it up and bring it back to my tip basket,” he said.
Like Glenshaw, many other vendors lauded the strong community at the open market.
“Every time I do a show like this, I meet new people and then we can do collaborations or learn about new shows,” Hartigan said.
Fiona Kikoyo, the owner of Phionah — a business that sells homemade pillows and candles — similarly admires the breadth of goods the market has to offer.
“This market just has diversity. There’s so much you can find here and everyone has different things to sell,” Kikoyo said.
So why support the market? Gabrielle Boyce, owner of The G Spot Vintage Shop shared a simple yet powerful answer.
“Support local artists! Support local businesses! Shop sustainably! Shop local!” she said. “Coming here puts money back into our city.”

Indie artist Japanese Breakfast, the project of writer and musician Michelle Zauner, is on the rise. After the release of her breakout third album “Jubilee,” which was nominated for two Grammy Awards, as well as the critical and commercial success of Zauner’s bestselling memoir “Crying in H Mart,” Japanese Breakfast has experienced a moment of long-awaited recognition nine years into their career. On Sept. 29, Zauner and her band performed at Boston’s Roadrunner to a sold-out audience. Zauner was completely at home on the stage, bringing her charisma and passion to the large venue. She loves to perform, and she wanted the audience to know it.
The concert began with “Paprika,” a bright and buzzy opener that announced the band’s presence with a chorus of horns. For this song, a light-up gong, which Zauner would hit enthusiastically on time with the music, was brought onstage. The gong stayed onstage for the remainder of the show, becoming the centerpiece of an effective minimalist set by changing colors to fit the mood of each song.
A confident opening song to Japanese Breakfast’s set, “Paprika” touches on the euphoria of performing onstage: “How’s it feel to stand at the height of your powers / To captivate every heart? / Projеcting your visions to strangers / Who feel it, who listen to linger on еvery word.” The song perfectly captured the energy of the crowd, who hung onto every note from the moment Zauner stepped onstage.
Zauner’s bouncy, infectious energy shone primarily through her music. Her clear voice and soaring high notes exuded joy. She didn’t spend much time talking to the audience, instead letting the performance speak for itself. The songs flowed seamlessly into each other, transitioning smoothly between the fizzy energy of “Jubilee” and the quieter, more ambient sound that characterized her earlier work in songs such as “The Woman That Loves You” and “Road Head.”
The setlist was a balanced mix of tracks from each of Japanese Breakfast’s three albums. Zauner performed some of her biggest hits, such as the energetic, city-pop song “Be Sweet” and the dreamy anthem “Boyish.” Interspersed between these hit singles were standout album tracks from Japanese Breakfast’s nine-year career.
Zauner’s charisma and stage presence added a new dimension to each song she performed. She sang “Savage Good Boy,” a satirical song about a billionaire hiding in a bunker at the end of the world, with an ironic attitude and wry delivery. And on the flip side, a particularly touching moment occurred during the wistful ballad “Tactics,” when Zauner’s bandmate and husband Peter Bradley joined her at the keyboard.
The band also performed the song “Glider,” an ethereal track from the video game “Sable,” whose soundtrack Zauner composed. Although the song was written to be heard alongside game visuals, “Glider” worked just as well as a standalone track in concert. The song’s atmospheric woodwinds coupled with Zauner’s vocals created a sense of stepping into a fantasy world reminiscent of Joe Hisaishi and Studio Ghibli.
Finally, a highlight of the show was concert opener Yo La Tengo, the ‘80s indie rock band who inspired Zauner’s own music. Yo La Tengo’s Ira Kaplan joined Japanese Breakfast on guitar for the final encore song “Diving Woman,” a powerhouse song that ends with a full three minutes of cacophonous noise from every instrument onstage. Kaplan is an incredible guitarist, and “Diving Woman” was a truly transcendent experience to hear live.
Japanese Breakfast’s show at Roadrunner captured the full range of the band’s discography, from plaintive longing to biting satire to the unfettered joy of “Jubilee.” And through it all, Zauner’s passion showed how deserving Japanese Breakfast is of their quickly rising fame. When they tour in Boston again, they’ll come back to an audience that’s eager for their return.

Kicking off her first night on tour in Boston, Maude Latour took the stage of Paradise Rock Club on Sept. 29. Hours before the release of her EP “001,” Latour told fans she was excited and grateful to celebrate the milestone with them.
Riding this wave of this excitement, Latour opened her show with her recently released single “Cyclone.” A song apt for the transition of summer adventures to fall and winter quiescence, it blends nostalgia for the past with themes of growth. Highlighting the struggle of finding oneself while alone, the song ultimately affirms the importance of community and human relationships with the ending refrain of “you know me well.”
Paying homage to her older works, Latour sang “Ride my Bike,” an exploration of spontaneity and the feeling of being alive. Emphasizing the importance of being present in the moment, “Ride my Bike,” like much of Latour’s music, focuses on enjoying where you are and what you have now. Shifts in Latour’s vocal pitch and the addition of fast-paced drum beats created a beat-drop worthy of dancing along to, encouraging her audience to put that message into practice.
Like many female-identifying artists who have performed recently, Latour chose to speak on abortion rights prior to performing “Lola,” a song about sisterhood, radical self love, and solidarity, according to the singer. Dedicating “Lola” to women, queer people, trans people, and the right to choose, Latour launched into the song’s verse, momentarily overshadowed by chants of “keep my girls protected, I’m turned on when I’m respected.”
Sharing anecdotes from her journey to Boston, Latour took a break during her set to talk to the audience, accept gifts from fans, and take their BeReals. Connection has always been a priority for the singer. From talking with fans online via social media, sharing behind the scenes photos of her life, and performing Tiny Desk-style concerts at Harvard’s own literary magazine, The Harvard Advocate, connecting with others has always been important to Latour. Taking this relationship a step further, Latour sought to welcome her audience into the world of performing. Dividing the crowd in half for the song “Trees,” the singer led each side in their respective vocal layer to create an all-encompassing harmony, reinforcing the song’s message that “everything is everything and I see you in everything.”
Maude Latour aptly chose to wrap up her set with the fan favorite track “One More Weekend.” With a strong beat and catchy lyrics, the pop ballad about accepting impermanence gave ample opportunity for singing, dancing, and just straight up having a good time. Re-entering the stage to quell the demands for an encore, Latour performed “Furniture” and “Block Your Number” to truly end the show. The two tracks further highlighted Latour’s belief in enjoying the moment, not worrying about the future too much, and focusing on community with lyrics illustrating that “nothing lasts forever” in the context of romantic relationships.
Latour’s dynamic performance created a powerful experience for all, garnering buzz for not only her newest EP but also her entire discography. A rapidly growing singer, Maude Latour is sure to continue on her path of creating dazzling music.

This past Friday, Oct. 7, Phoebe Bridgers’s 2017 debut album “Stranger in the Alps” earned a spot on the Billboard Top 200 list for the first time, coming in as the 82nd most popular album of the week. Sept. 22 marked the fifth anniversary of the album’s release, so fans have no doubt been revisiting the record that started Bridgers on the path to indie stardom. The coming of autumn, a season many fans associate with the singer-songwriter’s sweetly melancholic music, is yet another reason to queue up the album.
Given Bridgers’s impressive resume, which includes four Grammy nominations and collaborations with Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney, it’s not surprising to see her name top the charts. But this widespread acclaim would have been unthinkable for the Los Angeles-based artist just five years ago. “Stranger in the Alps” was truly the launch pad for Bridgers’s career. The eleven-track album unleashed Bridgers’s addictively cathartic blend of sorrow, humor, and anger on the world. It also opened up avenues for collaboration that would cement her role as not only the musical voice of today’s indie music scene, but also the embodiment of its spirit.
There is quite possibly no sound as immediately recognizable to “pharbs" (Phoebe Bridgers fans) as the opening chords of “Motion Sickness,” the second song on “Stranger in the Alps.” It’s still Bridgers’s most popular song, and for good reason — it’s a devastatingly effective exploration of the shock of a toxic relationship. “I hate you for what you did / And I miss you like a little kid,” she sweetly sings over a driving rock beat and distorted guitar. There’s no separation between love and resentment — the conjunction “and” forces listeners to join these opposites into one person. Bridgers’s gentle vocals also clash with the harsh instrumentation in the background, suggesting that she can’t fully acknowledge the rage she harbors inside. The song quickly takes a turn as it hurtles towards a liberating climax, a feature that has come to define Bridgers’s music. “I have emotional motion sickness / Somebody roll the windows down / There are no words in the English language / I could scream to drown you out,” she sings.
The song becomes all the more important when viewed in the context of Bridgers’s relationship with former indie artist Ryan Adams. After hearing some of her demo recordings in 2014, the prolific musician and producer invited Bridgers to work closely with him. The two quickly entered into a romantic relationship. According to Bridgers, Adams, who is 20 years older than her, began to display emotionally manipulative and abusive behavior. When Bridgers ended the relationship, Adams hinted at jeopardizing her career.
In an interview with the New York Times, Bridgers described how he became “evasive” about progress on her projects and even canceled her shows. After releasing “Motion Sickness,” she revealed that the song was about her former collaborator, becoming one of the first to publicly speak out against Adams. In 2019, she expressed support for the dozens of other women who later came forward about Adams’s abusive behavior. The first part of Bridgers’s career was nearly defined by Adams — many critics and fans attributed her success to his support. With “Stranger in the Alps,” her first major project without Adams’s involvement, she asserted that she surpassed his influence by sharing powerfully healing art.
A defining characteristic of Bridgers’s music that takes center stage in “Stranger in the Alps” is her personal narrative style. Her lyrics focus on specific life experiences as well as intimate thoughts and observations. On “Funeral,” she sings about performing at a friend’s memorial service. Though not all listeners may have lived through a similar situation, Bridgers uses it to craft a relatable and honest reflection on suffocating grief. “Jesus Christ, I’m so blue all the time / And that’s just how I feel / Always have and I always will,” she sighs in the chorus. She doesn’t feel the need to offer feel-good resolutions but embraces the emotional enormity of sadness. “And it’s 4 a.m. again / And I’m doing nothing / Again,” she sings at the end of the track.
Though undeniably bleak, Bridgers’s music feels more reflective than despondent. Her songs bask in melancholy but also look at it critically. Subtle humor is one of her most effective tools. On album-opener “Smoke Signals,” she explores the slow breakdown of a relationship. As she bitterly revisits memories, she sings, “I want to live at the Holiday Inn / Where somebody else makes the bed.” This line sounds out of place — ten-year-olds dream of living at chain hotels, not indie rockers in their twenties. This childish fantasy, however, indicates a genuine yearning for care and love in a relationship.
“Smoke Signals” is also one of the most musically developed tracks on the album with its string orchestra, wailing synth melody, and twangy guitar riffs. Another highlight is “Scott Street,” which builds a rich texture through an extensive palette of sound effects, from a soaring plane to a fire alarm. The rest of the album is well-produced but not as sonically diverse as Bridgers’s Grammy-nominated sophomore album “Punisher.” In fact, relistening to her debut record may leave fans a little disappointed. A standard folk-rock template is discernible across the eleven songs — sparse guitar chords swell with the addition of synth pads, heavier percussion, and layered vocals for the chorus. Additionally, the album closer “You Missed My Heart” is a cover of a Sun Kil Moon song. Bridgers’s interpretation is poignant but lacks the creativity of “Punisher”’s closer “I Know the End.”
After “Stranger in the Alps”’s warm reception, Phoebe Bridgers became one of the most promising new faces in indie music. Though impressive by itself, perhaps the album’s greatest contribution to her career was creating opportunities for collaboration. In the months following Bridgers’s 2017 debut, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker released critically acclaimed albums of their own — Dacus’s “Historian” and Baker’s “Turn Out the Lights”. The fortuitous timing of their releases caused many to highlight the similarities between the artists – all three are young women who write folk-rock songs with sad lyrics. Collaboration, not competition, arose as the artists formed the group boygenius and put out an eponymous record in 2018. The group stated that they aspired to challenge the archetype of the solitary “boy genius,” embodied by Bob Dylan and Elliott Smith. They succeeded. Their beautiful harmonies mesh perfectly to produce a powerful choral texture rarely seen in indie-rock. It’s clear that Bridgers used the album to push her musical creativity, as she experiments with arrangement techniques and tests her vocal range with the group.
The other major collaboration to arise out of “Stranger in the Alps” is Better Oblivion Community Center, Bridgers’s superduo with legendary Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst. The two met at a show in 2016, and Oberst agreed to provide backing vocals for “Would You Rather” on “Stranger in the Alps”. They released an eponymous label as Better Oblivion Community Center in 2019. This collaboration also saw Bridgers expand her sonic toolbox. The record is more upbeat than most of Bridgers’s songs, featuring driving folk melodies with satirical lyrics.
Artistically, these collaborations helped Bridgers build on the foundation she laid with her first album to create a more complex musical voice for “Punisher”. The album takes inspiration from Dacus’s driving rock rhythms, Baker’s deft banjo-playing, and Oberst’s love for sweeping orchestration. It retains the pensive and melancholic spirit of “Stranger in the Alps,” but packages it in a more sonically interesting way. It’s no wonder that “Punisher” is considered one of the best albums of the past few years.
Bridgers’s knack for bringing artists together has also made her a spokesperson and guardian spirit for indie music. Projects with mainstream artists like Kid Cudi, The 1975, and Taylor Swift have recruited a larger “pharb” fan base and brought attention to smaller-name artists associated with Bridgers. It’s rare to find an “indie” playlist on Spotify that doesn’t contain a Phoebe Bridgers song.
She also maintains the do-it-yourself ethos of independent music-making through Saddest Factory Records, the label she formed with Dead Oceans this past year. The label's signees range from the fan-favorite pop group MUNA to the experimental punk group Sloppy Jane. All of Saddest Factory’s artists have roots in L.A. — Sloppy Jane’s frontwoman Haley Dahl was in a band with Bridgers in high school — and the tight-knit group feels like an artists’ collective. “The label itself is a community, but I also feel like the listener is [part] of it. I see them interacting with each other in a way that feels more organic, sincere, and excited,” Dahl said in an interview with Flood Magazine.
At the end of “Scott Street,” Bridgers repeats over and over, “Anyway, don’t be a stranger.” She truly has taken this mantra to heart as an indie artist who enjoys widespread success.

With his new single “Celestial,” Ed Sheeran parts ways with his conventional love songs and ventures into new territory. On Sept. 29, Sheeran released this inspiring anthem about “finding magic in the smallest things,” expressing an aspect of his personality he has not previously highlighted to his audience: his love of Pokémon.
“[Pokémon] gave me a proper escape as a kid into a fantasy world that seemed to go on and on, and in adult life it’s nostalgia that makes me feel like a kid again,” said Sheeran in a recent statement on his Instagram. “Celestial” will be featured in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, two Nintendo Switch games planned to be released on Nov. 18, 2022.
When compared with Sheeran’s past body of music, “Celestial” is fairly jarring. Sheeran has been the target of quite a few jokes in the past on social media — mostly regarding the fact that besides his musical success, the artist is a seemingly boring, regular guy — but it was safe to say that none of this lukewarm attention has been centered around his affection for youth gaming. Now, that focus has become a highlight of Sheeran’s brand; his social media presence is almost entirely populated by Pokémon promotions, including an Instagram prank in which he reveals a tattoo of Squirtle on his forearm, which (thankfully) turned out to be temporary.
It seems as though Sheeran has lost some of his knack for lyricism with this new single. Whether due to his catering to a new audience of young gamers, or his choice to maintain a more poppy, commercial tone, the overall lack of lyrical originality is notable. Take this line from “Celestial”’s chorus: “You make me feel / Like I’m drunk on stars, and we’re dancing out into space.” The cliché metaphors and abstract descriptions of love may appeal to a more general Pokémon-playing audience, but they are a marked departure from Sheeran’s body of lyrically-specific love songs of the past. When you consider Sheeran’s “The A Team,” following a sex worker addicted to cocaine, or “Perfect,” a love song written for his old girlfriend and schoolmate, “Celestial,” with its vague descriptions of clouds, skies, and drinking the stars, pales in comparison.
This isn’t to say that “Celestial” doesn’t have its charms. The song is catchy, easy to sing, and bolstered by a motivational synthesizer-driven beat. It’s the type of single that would liven up any commercial space, or accompany drivers during their morning commute. It even has a partially animated music video featuring wholesome Pokémon interactions. “Celestial” doesn’t quite present itself as artistically ambitious or engaging, but it does fulfill its role, and for that, it deserves credit.
With “Celestial,” Sheeran makes a bold, albeit potentially unsuccessful, venture outside his wheelhouse. His new single may not be the new high point of his career, but it still serves as a heartwarming collaboration between Sheeran and one of his long-standing favorite franchises. If one approaches “Celestial” without the high expectations derived from Sheeran’s previous profile of work, they might find more appreciation for the song in the absence of unfulfilled expectations. In this case, they might even manage to resonate with Sheeran’s personal promotion of the single: “I love [‘Celestial’], you’re gonna love it. And we all gotta catch ‘em all.”

Smino and J. Cole dropped their new collaborative single “90 Proof,” the first release from Smino’s forthcoming album “Luv 4 Rent.” Produced by Monte Booker and Groove, the track immediately demands the bopping of heads, cut through by the characteristic melodies of Smino’s flow. “Luv 4 Rent,” release date unknown, is set to be the St. Louis rapper’s third studio album, following his 2018 sophomore album “Noir” and his 2017 album “Blkswn.” This is not Smino’s first collaboration with J. Cole, whose most recent album, “The Off Season,” dropped in May 2021. They appeared together on “1993” and “Sacrifices” from Cole’s Dreamville compilation record “Revenge of the Dreamers III” in 2019.
“90 Proof” samples “E Ma S'eka” by Bola Johnson & His Easy Life Top Beats over a warm guitar and sharp drum beat. Smino begins his verse with vodka-strength honesty, confessing, “Don’t blame yourself for all the shit you see me do/ I’m getting used to being loved, girl / The right way.” He admits that he might finally be ready for the monogamous lifestyle with the lyrics “Patient, baby, gotta make a couple rounds / 'Fore I make it back to you to settle down.” Cole uses his verse to speak on loyalty, telling listeners that he might have finally found a “real one” who wouldn’t leave him even if he was broke.
On Oct. 5, Smino also released an official visualizer to accompany the track. Directed by Phillip Youmans, the video is more of a sketch than a music video. In the video, Smino’s partner asks to see his phone. After initially refusing, he takes a shot of 90 Proof vodka and gives up his phone, saying he has nothing to hide. The video ends with an ad-like shot of a cheeky Smino smiling and holding up a bottle of 90 Proof.
The track’s cover art depicts a mean wince on Smino’s face, contrasting the silky and smooth-sounding song with a beautiful portrayal of Smino’s outlook on love — sometimes it’s hard to swallow. If the rest of “Luv 4 Rent” is anything like “90 Proof,” fans are surely in for a treat.

Cheers rang through TD Garden as an ominous hourglass appeared on screen along with a 10-minute countdown timer slowly ticking away as fans eagerly awaited the start of Panic! At The Disco’s Boston show on Sept. 28. As the seconds ticked to zero, the lights dimmed and smoke began to billow out from the stage as a nervous buzz crept over the crowd. The tension broke as the band’s iconic logo flashed on stage while a camera followed frontman Brendon Urie backstage through the opening bars of “Say Amen (Saturday Night),” before emerging, clad in all black, to the roar of fans screaming along as he sang out “Oh, It’s Saturday Night.”
Despite the Wednesday night time slot, the crowd brought the energy of a weekend performance cheering and singing along through some of Panic! At The Disco’s greatest hits over the first six tracks on the setlist. The opening song was followed up by high energy crowd-pleasers “Hey Look Ma, I Made It” and “Don't Threaten Me With a Good Time.” But even these high-energy tracks couldn’t top the sheer cacophony of 19,000 people unapologetically screaming along as Urie belted out the cathartic “if you love me let me go” while singing his 2013 hit “This is Gospel.” The band closed out Act I of the concert with “Emperor's New Clothes,” leaving fans in darkness as Urie disappeared from the stage.
Almost everything about Panic! At The Disco has changed since the release of the band’s debut album “A Fever You Can't Sweat Out” back in 2005. Three of the band’s four original members left the project, and after years of shuffling, the Panic! moniker has come to describe Urie as well as a changing cast of “touring members.”
On the “Viva Las Vengeance Tour,” Panic! At The Disco takes a big risk, playing the entirety of their newest album of the same name from front to back in order. No pauses. No breaks. No interjections.
It’s a risk that not only leaves the show with an hour-long stretch without any of the band’s greatest hits, but also leads to a natural comparison between the band’s older, darker sound and their new brighter image. Something Urie leans into, swapping out his black rhinestone jacket for a brightly colored suit jacket when remerging for Act II.
The decision garnered mixed audience reactions. Particularly, given that “Viva Las Vengeance” was not a well received album (though it’s not nearly as bad as former emo kids on TikTok would lead you to believe). For casual listeners, or even just hardcore core fans who prefer Panic!’s older sound, the contrast between the earlier crowd-pleasers and “Viva Las Vengeance” was stark. As one concert-goer poignantly put it, “I’ll pee during Viva Las Vengeance.”
But more than anything, the setlist was indicative of where Panic! At The Disco’s priorities lie. With 17 years in the music industry and dozens of hits, Panic! At The Disco has reached the point where not everything the audience wants can make it into the show. And while playing the band’s newest album in its entirety may not be a popular decision among casual concert-goers and older fans, it demonstrates an admirable commitment to Panic! fans who have remained dedicated through the band's evolution.
One thing that was constant across the three acts was the incredible production and stage design. Lighting played a key role in facilitating the transitions between acts, offering gorgeous visual cues onstage to complement both the moodier tone of Acts I and III as well as the blinding brightness of Act II.
And while the setlist is unconventional, not even the hit-or-miss tracks on “Viva Las Vengeance” can fetter Urie’s pure vocal talent. His ability to ascend through an ever-rising vocal range continues to impress, even as the constant high-pitch notes border on grating.
To the relief of many, Urie again disappeared from the stage as the final notes of “Do It to Death” rang through the venue, marking the end of Act II and promising a return to Panic! At The Disco’s greatest hits. When Urie returned to the stage, now wearing a white jacket, it was to sing “Girls / Girls / Boys,” in a celebration of bisexuality as rainbows bathed the stage, and audience members used their flashlights and colored pieces of paper to create a rainbow sea.
Through the end of the concert, it was a non-stop string of Panic!’s best tracks including “House of Memories,” “Nine in the Afternoon,” and “Death of a Bachelor.” No one in the audience missed a single word while singing along to “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” — the uncontested highlight of the night. Finally the show ended with performances of “Victorious” and the ever optimistic “High Hopes.”
It’s said that the only things people remember are first and last impressions. With a strong start and triumphant finish, that was certainly the case with the “Viva Las Vengeance Tour” as audience members filed out of TD Garden smiling from ear to ear.

As the sun set over Long Island Sound on Saturday, Sept. 24, an unmistakable excitement buzzed in the air for this year’s Sound on Sound Music Festival. Soon, The Lumineers would take the Seaside Stage. To this largely granola crowd, the band can be considered something of a cultural icon — so the collective anticipation was palpable.
Despite the high expectations that awaited them, The Lumineers did not falter. Lead singer and guitarist Wesley Schultz delivered his signature gritty vocals in a vocal performance that — had it not for one lyrical mixup during “Ho Hey” — could easily have been accused of lip-syncing, so pristine was its quality. With a well-planned synchronization of stage movement; a satisfying variety of slower, more instrumental songs like “Charlie Boy” as well as fuller, upbeat songs like “Big Parade”; and lovely violin melodies uniting it all (courtesy of Lauren Jacobson), the performance was something of a spiritual experience.
image id=1358239 align=center size=large caption=true
With an expansive 20-song setlist, the band certainly more than satiated the crowd’s hunger to hear all of their favorite tracks from the group’s different eras. Afterwards, with the last of “Stubborn Love” ringing in everyone’s heads and hearts, the crowd was left to await Saturday’s headliner, the legendary Stevie Nicks, filled with the reminder that The Lumineers are truly one of the best things to have ever come from folk rock.
Another similarly talented folk rock band to grace the Sound on Sound stages was The Head and the Heart, this time on Sunday, Sept. 25. Despite donning primarily black attire — with the exception of the split dyed pink-blue hair of member Charity Rose Thielen — The Head and the Heart colored the cloudy Connecticut day with a setlist full of energetic rhythms powered by foundations of strong percussion and guitar complemented by the lighter tones of the keys and the violin.
Aside from this being the band’s first time performing in Bridgeport, lead singer Jonathan Russell recalled the group’s time living in their producer’s home in the city for a month mixing what would become their 2013 record, “Let’s Be Still.” Surely, some of that nostalgia was captured during “Rivers and Roads,” their most popular song and the last of the set. Beginning with a mellow acoustic line, the song swells into a gorgeous arrangement of harmonies and poignant lyrics that — while terrific on the recorded track — pack a different punch when delivered with the rawness of a live performance. And with the rain beginning to fall on the festival right as the song began to build, the concert’s final moments were nothing short of picturesque.
Later on, as the second and final day of Sound on Sound began to close, folk rock artist Brandi Carlile took the stage. She started with some spunk — leading with song “Broken Horses” — and from the set’s onset it was clear that Carlile’s bright, wholesome energy would be infectious. Carlile appeared to have the time of her life performing — dancing, interacting with the crowd, and smiling all the while — with a dynamic setlist to match. She performed snappier, rock-leaning songs like “The Story,” intermingled slower, softer tracks like “The Eye” (with glorious harmonies by brothers Phil and Tim Hanseroth), as well as covers of classic favorites like “Space Oddity” by David Bowie and Radiohead’s “Creep.”
Carlile also shared the heartwarming personal touches of family in her music, particularly her relationship with her wife, Catherine Shepherd, in “You and Me On the Rock” as well as her two daughters, Evangeline and Elijah, with “Mama Werewolf.” These pieces felt especially sweet given the fact that Carlile’s family had joined her at the show that night. The bottom line remains that Carlile clearly has an impressive voice — expressive, powerful, and with that distinctive twang — and she sure knows how to use it. It is this combined, however, with her unabashed confidence in her identity (ending with an acoustic cover of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” with a pride flag on the big screen), joyous stage presence, evident love for her craft, and generally endearing personality that make Brandi Carlile a true class act. And whether swaying to a mellow ballad or completely rocking out, there was never a moment when she did not have the crowd in the palm of her hand.

For many manic pixie dream queers, Björk is a queen mother type of figure. “Cocoon,” off of her 2001 album “Vespertine,” is a good example of why — it’s the kind of soft, sonically gorgeous expression of unfettered desire that is rarely conveyed through music. Set against whispers and echoing clicks, Björk’s voice seems to sing directly from an embodied space of utopian queer longing: “Who would have known / That a boy like him / After sharing my core / Would stay going nowhere?”
Her discography can be difficult to crack at times. Her earlier works are more accessible — her first album “Debut” released in 1993 and its 1995 follow-up, “Post,” stick closer to familiar pop structures, though they also simultaneously subvert them at every turn. Since then, Björk’s sound has been unplaceable; while their 2004 album “Medulla” is almost entirely a cappella, “Vulnicura,” from 2015, features 10-minute divorce ballads with skull-crushing bass breaks.
In comparison, “Fossora,” Björk’s 10th studio album, sounds like it should be played at a rave of woodland creatures, thrown beneath a giant mossy toadstool. Björk has referred to it as her “mushroom album,” and this holds true, not only in terms of song titles (“Mycelium,” “Fungal City”) but thematically. Across its ten tracks, “Fossora” gives new shape to death, metabolizing grief into something nurturing and at times, even hallucinogenic.
“Fossora” is Björk’s first album after her mother’s passing in 2018, an event that comes through in detail in the back-to-back tracks “Sorrowful Soil” and “Ancestress.” The latter, one of the most emotionally powerful songs on the album, conjures a complex, contradictory late mother-daughter relationship over a gong and gorgeous string plucks: “Her once vibrant rebellion is fading / I am her hope-keeper.”
The biological theme of the album comes through in different ways on “Atopos,” the album’s first single and opener, whose lyrics are inspired by Barthes’s theory of “the unclassifiable Other,” and whose steady clip of bass clarinet honks and eventual devolution into a massively punchy gabber beat ushers techno into the still too-narrow scope of what can be considered “nature music.” The beat in question is in part thanks to Kasimyn, one-half of the Indonesian hardcore duo Gabber Modus Operandi, whom Björk cites as influential in conceptualizing the album.
Set partially against a backdrop of what can be described as “garden gnome music” (a statement made in total adulation, of course), the thrumming factor of “Fossora” is conspicuous; some listeners may be put off by its contrast to the easier beauty of the album’s classical instrumentalization. The existence of title track “Fossora,” the album’s most brain-melting song, testifies to this tension — which is precisely what makes the album’s sound so special. In the context of much of the world shaking itself back to life as Covid-19 restrictions loosen, it’s hard not to read “Fossora” as a timely call to action, a call — convincing, if contradictory — to get outside and rave, not despite our messy, heavy emotions, but because of them.
Music lovers should all be thankful for Björk. In a time when patient, mindful art-making is succumbing to the TikTok content-churning machine, listeners should treasure the fact that she still has the means (and the guts) to dedicate time, effort, and emotional labor to a cohesive project. (She has been releasing albums for 34 years.) Björk’s offerings of lush music videos with stunning set and costume design, camped-out album art, and even behind-the-scenes snippets of her creative process, in the context of the state of popular music today, feel more and more like gifts to the attentive listener.
There’s another moment toward the end of “Ancestress” that holds a special power. The lyric goes: “Nature wrote this psalm / It expands this realm.” Björk (our illustrious queen mother of word-warping) bisects the monosyllable of “realm,” pronouncing it “re-alm.” It fits the rhyme, sure, but the action of this halving (or doubling) creates a nexus for new meaning. Björk’s music, her life’s work, could be taken to be the “alm” here, as in giving alms — the fruit of her immense compassion, of her dogged optimism and desire to connect. The “alm” is “re,” is repetitive because it re-fills the shape of something lost, whether that be to sickness or to bereavement. “Fossora” emerges after a period of pandemic-driven isolation to re-emphasize and revitalize the connections we had all along but didn’t sufficiently treasure. It sprouts from barren ground to return us to our ever-changing Earth, a planet whose soil will one day hold us all, whose creative energy is all but infinite, and whose thin crust still, impossibly, supports our jumping, raving, stomping feet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For as long as I can remember, my elected representatives have invoked the Christian god at every school committee meeting in my hometown.
“Lord,” begins the prayer in no uncertain terms, “as we begin this session, let us acknowledge your goodness and mercy, and ask your blessings on all our deliberations. We thank you for this opportunity to be of service to our community and to the young people entrusted to our care.”
The sentiment of the prayer is not lost on me. It treats the care of young people as the lofty responsibility that it is, and I have no doubt that it is well-intentioned. But every time I attended one of those meetings, and every time it opened with a prayer, I shrank into myself. It was clear that I was different, the “other,” simply for what I believed. That my worldview was less valid. That the people to whose care I was “entrusted” deemed it acceptable to disregard me.
The practice was discomforting; it was unnecessary. It was also, much to my surprise, completely constitutionally acceptable.
Legislative invocations are a symbolic representation of the growing tide of Christian Nationalism in the United States. They do not blame atheists for mass violence or enable discrimination against marginalized groups, but they do send a clear message to the nation’s citizens —religious and nonreligious alike —about where our elected officials believe they derive their authority from. And more often than not, invocators are not looking to include everyone in their constituency.
Religious invocations for legislative sessions first became a constitutional issue in the Supreme Court’s 1983 case Marsh v. Chambers. The case concerned the Nebraska legislature’s practice of beginning each session with a prayer delivered by a publicly-funded chaplain, a position that had only been filled by a Presbyterian minister for the sixteen years preceding the case. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that the practice was constitutional, citing the historical prevalence of legislative prayer in the United States. The practice did not violate the Establishment Clause, the majority decided, but was rather “a tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.”
The Supreme Court would expand on this decision in 2014 with Town of Greece v. Galloway, ruling that legislative prayer practices which allowed members of the community to deliver invocations were constitutional as well. These prayers did not need to be non-sectarian, as the government was not in a position to police religious speech, and they would not be considered coercive.
Yet the ceremonial weight of legislative prayer is not simply limited to an internal impact on a legislative body. It lends credence to a religious interpretation of the purpose of government, and of that body in particular. And as so often happens in religious matters in the United States, that ceremonial weight falls almost universally in Christians’ favor and at the expense of minority religious communities.
The complaint in the Greece case was brought by two plaintiffs, one Jewish and one atheist, both of whom attested that the overwhelming Christian prayers were not at all inclusive  of their community. In 2005, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Cynthia Simpson could be blocked from delivering an invocation due to her Wiccan beliefs, saying that Simpson’s prayer would not fit with the “unifying aspects of our heritage.” Legislators have often made a show of publicly protesting non-Christian invocations, deriding Quranic readings as “despicable,” attacking Hinduism as a “false faith with false gods,” and responding to a humanist invocation by asking God to “forgive us for our arrogance.”
In each of these cases, a narrow but vocal subset of Christian politicians ignore the fact that these individuals, often their constituents and colleagues, experience the same discomfort every time a Christian prayer is used to open a meeting.
Unfortunately, in the years since the Greece ruling, that same vocal subset of Christian politicians has found ways to use the decision to target and exclude atheists specifically. In 2019, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Fields v. Speaker that atheists could be banned from delivering invocations in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives because they were not specifically invoking “divine guidance.” That same year, a three-judge panel in the D.C. Circuit handed down a similar ruling in Barker v. Conroy, ruling that even though he met nearly all the legal requirements, Dan Barker could be blocked from delivering an invocation before Congress because he would not be invoking a traditional higher power.
The clear preference for theism, and specifically for Christianity, within legislative prayers is no accident. On paper, the purpose of invocations may well be to solemnize the deliberations, and for some, Christian prayers may well succeed in doing just that. But that is never their sole consequence. When a circuit court or city council deems it acceptable to explicitly exclude atheists, ignore minority religious communities, and host almost exclusively Christian voices, that is a deliberate choice with the specific aim of asserting to the public that Christianity and the American government are intertwined. Other beliefs are off-handedly cast out of our national cultural heritage.
If we are to make legislative invocations a genuinely inclusive civic practice, we must ensure that all of the many religious and nonreligious communities that make up our country can be and are welcomed. That means allowing all communities, regardless of whether they invoke our understanding of a “higher power” or fit with our “heritage,” to encourage us to work together using their own spiritual or ethical language. That means consciously going out of our way to invite in historically underrepresented communities. And that means embracing our diversifying religious landscape to engage with one another all the more deeply.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, my family always reminded me that there’s beauty in the unknown; something that is new isn’t necessarily something to be afraid of.
I mean, it works that way with food. I still remember my horror at eating grasshoppers for the first time in Oaxaca, Mexico. Everywhere I looked on my plate, a million beady eyes stared right into my soul. I took my first bite with my eyes squeezed shut — yet a few chews later, I realized that grasshoppers taste practically like chicken. Not so scary after all.
Harvard is similar to eating grasshoppers. When I first chose Harvard, I was ecstatic — everything I’d ever worked toward was mine. But, as the months progressed, that overwhelming ecstasy morphed into a twisted feeling, reminiscent of my grasshopper-eating experience. I couldn’t stomach knowing that my life was about to drastically change.
You see, 95 percent of Laredo, Texas, my hometown, is comprised of Hispanic or Latino Americans, and these demographics heavily influenced everyday life. I spoke in Spanish to my friends between classes, joked about the “chisme” circulating within our hallways, and learned from three Ms. Garcias, two Ms. Rodriguezes, and two Mr. Gonzalezes throughout my education. Whether I realized it or not, my Mexican culture enveloped me throughout my childhood and teenage years.
When I came to Harvard, however, this comforting blanket was torn from me. For instance, people on campus were unable to say my name. I’m Silvana. Yet, throughout my first semester at Harvard, the name gifted to me by my mother morphed into Savannah, then Svetlana, then Sylvia, until I finally began asking people to “call me Silver…yes, like the metal.” Since my not-so-voluntary name change, I can probably count the number of people that have attempted to pronounce my actual name on two hands.
My most jarring experience of culture shock at Harvard happened on Sept. 16, 2021, my first Mexican Independence Day away from home. I dressed in my handmade Oaxacan huipil, rebozo, and filigree jewelry. After struggling to apply my dried-out red lipstick, I left my Wigglesworth suite fully prepared for a Mariachi’s serenade — and needless to say, that wasn’t the case. Instead, I was met with a gloomy gray sky and soggy ground. September 16th may be commonly known as Mexican Independence Day (although some confuse it for May 5th), but in my calendar, it’s marked as the day when I realized I was no longer at home.
Home, however, is with me wherever I go. I may not be as immersed in my Mexican culture as I am in Laredo, but I haven’t forgotten it. Whenever I see a Hispanic student on campus, I immediately have a full-blown conversation with them in Spanish, and I plan to dress up every September 16th, even if no one recognizes the cultural significance of my outfit.
Although I haven’t been taught by another Ms. Garcia at Harvard, the proctor of the entryway I am a Peer Advising Fellow for coincidentally shares the same Iberian surname as my favorite 10th grade World History teacher. And sure, it sucks that I don’t hear my name as often anymore — especially considering its importance to my identity — but maybe “Silver” indicates the new person I’m becoming while I’m here.
When my childhood friends ask me, “What’s Harvard like?” I’m unsure of what to tell them. A casual “it’s pretty cool” usually suffices, yet these words hide what it’s really like to be a Mexican-American student at Harvard. On the one hand, Harvard is a “land of opportunity,” where Wall Street geniuses invest billions of endowment dollars on our education. And as a Latina, I’m living, breathing proof that far-fetched dreams like Harvard can be reached with dedication and a “sí se puede.”
However, the disconnect that exists within our communities is palpable. I’m ashamed of my homesickness, especially when I’m an “inspiration” to those who weren’t able to leave Laredo in the first place. Sometimes, I wish I could force people to pronounce my name correctly because I miss Silvana and what she represented. Yet, I appreciate everything Silver has done for me.
Unfortunately, the disconnect I feel at Harvard is part of the deal. When we all chose Harvard, we chose to leave our homes, and with that, a part of our identities. However, this detachment shouldn’t be mourned. If anything, we’re each a missing puzzle piece that belongs to a different puzzle. Try fitting us together, and we won’t create a single image. But we all fit together somehow, even if imperfectly.
Coming to Harvard detached me from my past identity, but introduced me to a version of myself that is equally as important. I’m still a missing puzzle piece, but I’m slowly finding people and communities that I see myself fitting in with.
I now realize I’ve been so focused on keeping Silvana’s memory alive that I’ve missed out on the person I’m becoming. Exactly who that is, I’m not yet sure, but I’m excited to find out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our campus is, although sometimes a restrictive Harvard “bubble,” also quite safe — at least according to a University report released on September 30, which reported the lowest levels of on-campus crime in the past decade.
Harvard’s report — which suggested that crime rates fell for the fourth year in a row in 2021, with only 142 registered criminal incidents — certainly appears encouraging. Yet tethering any public discussion of safety to highly variable (as well as easy to miscalculate or misrepresent) crime statistics can be misleading. Particularly given the lingering effect of pandemic-era restrictions, we find reason to doubt that the statistical picture closely mirrors the reality of our community. The marginal swings identified by such reports, if overstated in relevance, risk flattening all nuance to alternately cause excess alarmism and undue relaxation. Student and affiliate safety should remain our priority, regardless of fast-shifting numbers.
On that front, and despite the reassuring report, our Editorial Board cannot feel at ease. Just last fall, out of concern for student safety and comfort, we praised Harvard for its policy of closing its gates to the public after 5 p.m. and argued in favor of making permanent a revised version of said policy. A year later we recognize that our reasoning was deeply misguided: The real threat to student safety on campus lies not beyond the gates in Cambridge, but within.
The call, as they say, is coming from inside the house.
No non-University Cambridge resident poses quite as acute and constant a threat to Harvard affiliates as their own peers; suggesting otherwise, and, in doing so, othering our entire local community and depicting them as an alien menace to be locked out for our safety was our grave mistake. Depictions of Cambridge — a city the US Chamber of Commerce recently deemed the second-safest city in America for trick-or-treating because of low numbers of violent crime, pedestrain fatalities and registered sex offenders — as somehow ‘dangerous’ are nothing but distracting, unbridled alarmism.
Truth is, in our quiet corner of Massachusetts, any potential external harm pales in comparison to the greatest danger students face on a daily basis: Title IX concerns, and the University’s failure to adequately address them. When we speak of a Title IX crisis on campus, as we have been forced to do with depressing frequency, we mean that there are people whom we considered members of our community that violate Title IX guidelines. Sexual assault and harassment cases do not just magically appear on a campus devoid of active perpetrators. A perverse subsector of our peers, professors and other non-Cantabrigian acquaintances represents the most recurrent and intractable threat to our safety.
But how could we feel fully secure with alleged predators, such as professors Roland G. Fryer Jr. and John L. Comaroff, among our teaching staff? How, then, can the Yard be a safe space for all, gates locked or not?
The short answer is that it can’t be — and won’t be until the University finally recognizes Title IX as a public safety concern of paramount importance, one that affects the entire campus. As we have argued before, doing so entails the University taking a proactive, not reactive, approach to Title IX issues on campus: a combination of having consistent dialogues to improve Title IX policies, fostering an explicitly and aggressively anti-harassment campus culture, and finally implementing third-party arbitration, which the graduate student union has repeatedly strived for. It might, more pressingly, also involve accepting greater institutional responsibility, perhaps by reconsidering a University-wide reading of Title IX so intent on legally distancing the University from the alleged retaliatory practices of its faculty members that it has prompted reproach from the Department of Justice itself.
Above all, the shift towards treating sexual misconduct as our chief safety concern must entail a recommitment to Title IX reform on campus and beyond. The constructive feedback that the American Council on Education, a higher education membership organization that includes Harvard, has shared with the Biden administration on its proposed Title IX amendments embodies said commitment, and highlights a prime opportunity to make strides in redefining Title IX procedures across college campuses.
The process won’t be without controversy. There are increasing fair concerns regarding reform, particularly about lackluster due process protections afforded to the accused in some proposed amendments — even if none of them are sufficiently convincing, at this time, to distract us from addressing the obstacles that lead an estimated 63 percent of rape cases to go unreported. Said obstacles, we know, stem from deep rooted cultural issues that cannot be neatly uprooted by policy: For many victims, often women, coming forward means not only confronting their attackers, but also facing up to an overwhelming culture of shame and dismissal that reinforces trauma before a path toward justice ever appears.
We are also aware that in cases involving the prosecution of severe accusations, the golden standard of innocent until proven guilty — albeit theoretically sacrosanct — tends to prove malleable. When inherent inequalities in conceived notions of deservingness — of respect, dignity, and compassion — come into play, the standard is rapidly corrupted. That much is neither new nor unique: The presumed criminality of marginalized identities (particularly racial ones, given the inflated carceral and exoneration rates of Black people), and inversely, the presumed innocence of young white men facing misconduct accusations in particular, has been well recorded.
These concocted notions of inherent innocence or guilt sway us too frequently — particularly when physical evidence is scant, as is often the case with allegations of misconduct or harassment. In those instances, the crushing burden of proof placed on victims to avoid any potential injuries inflicted upon the accused’s reputation and future prospects reveals a grotesque misalignment between the principle of ensuring justice and the real procedural hurdles to doing so. The resulting framework prioritizes the accused’s imagined bright future over the real, damning assaults that have violently derailed victims’ life courses.
Our sorely-needed Title IX paradigm shift should reflect that reality. Until it does, many of our fellow peers, especially those who identify as queer or female, will remain unacceptably fearful within a city otherwise safe enough to prove dull. It is not their exclusive obligation to painstakingly negotiate culture or policy changes that address their fears — that burden falls upon all of us within the gates.
The call is coming from inside the house — the bold, uncompromising answer must do so too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association announced its official 2023 budget, approved social funding, and introduced a Blue Bikes subsidy program at its weekly general meeting Sunday.
The Association, along with some student attendees, convened in the Smith Center's Collaborative Commons during its new weekly meeting time.
After receiving a $550,000 allocation from the Dean of Students office last week — a 10 percent increase from that of the since-dissolved Undergraduate Council — HUA leaders spent the majority of Sunday’s meeting describing fund allocation.
HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24 and Finance Officer Alexander J. Zurovec ’25 said $452,000 will be allocated to the Finance Team for distribution to student organizations — a 16 percent increase from the Undergraduate Council.
The budget distributes $17,250 to the Well-Being Team, $17,000 to the Executive Team, $22,250 to the Residential Life Team, $16,500 to the Social Life Team, $14,000 to the Academics Team, $8,000 to the Extracurriculars Team, and $3,000 to the Sports Team.
The HUA will also renew a $6,000 endorsement deal with Harvard Student Agencies, which will go toward the Association’s operations budget, leaders announced Sunday. The deal, which began under the UC, requires HUA to publicize HSA’s class ring offerings.
HUA members also voted to pursue a new Blue Bikes subsidy project, which would allocate as much as $6,000 toward providing reduced-cost Blue Bikes subscriptions to students by late October.
Members voted to provide $1,000 in funding to the Lowell Housing Committee to support its annual “Glowell” event.

Ann Forman Lippens ’11 said she “barely used” her alumni email forwarding address after her graduation, except in one important moment — to email her now-husband after meeting him at a bar.
“I didn’t want him to have my gmail address in case he ended up being a total weirdo,” Lippens, a former Crimson Design editor, wrote in an email. “So I used my @post.harvard.edu account to email him.”
Now married a decade later, Lippens speculated that email forwarding gave her a sense of privacy and perhaps even the confidence to reach out.
But last month, the Harvard Alumni Association announced it will deactivate all alumni email forwarding addresses over the next two years, leaving some alums concerned about the loss of this means of communication. Email forwarding services provide an alias where emails can be received but are not fully-functioning inboxes.
Graduates following the Class of 2020 did not have the ability to create forwarding accounts.
Some existing accounts will be deactivated as early as Dec. 1, per an email from the Harvard Alumni Association sent to the impacted alums, which cited email security, spam filtering, and functionality considerations in the decision.
Adam S. Hickey ’99, who received notice from the HAA on Sept. 30 that his @post.harvard.edu email would be deactivated on Dec. 1, said the news was “somewhat shocking.”
“I liked the idea of having an address that was going to follow me forever, so that if I change from one provider to another in the future, that address would always be good. And so I used my post.harvard address for almost everything, virtually everything that asked me for an email address,” said Hickey, a former Crimson Editorial editor. “Over the last 20-some years, hundreds of accounts.”
Harvard spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessey wrote in a statement that the University introduced alumni email forwarding in the late 1990s, and technologies around security and spam filtering have since evolved. Many alumni have expressed frustration with the functionality of forwarding services, and Harvard is typically unable to address these problems, he wrote.
Hennessey added that Harvard will not be replacing alumni email forwarding services with fully functioning inboxes due to the legal and security risks associated with the undertaking.
Emily Van Dyke ’03, president of the Native American Alumni of Harvard University and a board member for the Harvard Club of Seattle, said she worries the change may lead to “impacts on communications” with members of the groups.
“Those of us who have a very small, very overcommitted group of people like on NAAHU’s board, we’re not going to have the resources to proactively come up with a way to make sure people aren’t taken by surprise if if they’re suddenly effectively removed from our listserv,” Van Dyke said.
In an email to leaders of alumni clubs and shared interest groups, HAA Executive Director Philip W. Lovejoy wrote that organizations that use forwarding services for verification of alumni status or as an email account will be presented with alternative solutions.
“While we explore alternatives, your Club or SIG email forwarding address will not be deactivated until we have a new option to provide,” Lovejoy wrote.
Some alumni had not heard about the forwarding service deactivation prior to outreach from The Crimson.
“I didn’t know about this and I don’t know the underlying reason why they’re discontinuing,” Henry Li ’16 wrote in an email. “I don’t use the email very much at all, maybe once over the past 5 years, but it would still be nice to keep it, especially if it’s not costing Harvard much money.”
Though Van Dyke said deactivations may pose new challenges, she acknowledged the reasons behind phasing out the service.
“I am sorry that they’re not able to honor this commitment because we were all told that we’d have these emails in perpetuity,” Van Dyke said. “It is disappointing to lose that, but I’m sure we’ll manage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square hosted Cambridge’s 43rd Annual Oktoberfest on Sunday, complete with beer, sausages, and music to entertain overflow crowds.
The event, which took place on Church St. and Brattle St., has been hosted in the Square every year since 1978, when it was first organized by Frank Cardullo.
The event coincided with the 17th Annual HONK! Parade, the first-ever Filipino American Festival in Harvard Square, and a poetry festival celebrating the 95th anniversary of the Grolier Poetry Book Shop.
The popular Harvard Square restaurants Alden and Harlow and Wusong Road hosted Oktoberfest outdoor beer gardens, along with the Commonwealth Wine School.
Several live music stages were set up throughout the Square, featuring an array of bands from Cambridge and beyond.
The weekend festivities began at 1 p.m. with the HONK! Parade, a brass street music performance that featured more than 20 bands.
Many musical groups performed on the Oktoberfest main stage, including La Banda Internacional de Chelsea, the Jamaica Plain Honk Band, and the School of Honk.
Sunday's festivities also included the Filipino American Festival, hosted by the Harvard Square Philippine American Alliance for the first time this year in honor of Filipino American History Month. Filipino artists and bands performed on a stage located in a Church St. parking lot, alongside booths set up by local Filipino-owned businesses.
The festival was headlined by a 5:30 p.m. performance by rapper EZ Mil, who was joined by other artists and dance troupes on the Church St. Stage.
The weekend also featured an art installation called “Chalk on the Walk,” which invited attendees to create chalk artwork on the Church St. pavement.
The Grolier Poetry Book Shop, founded in 1927, joined Oktoberfest for the first time this year in celebration of its 95th anniversary. The shop hosted poetry readings, including from Boston Youth Poet Laureate Anjalequa Birkett and current Boston Poet Laureate Porsha Olayiwola.
Revels, a Cambridge-based performance group, also joined the festivities on Sunday to promote its Midwinter Revels program, which will be held in Sanders Theatre in December.
Jennifer Sur, the organization’s administrative services manager, said Revels’ productions “look at different cultures and different time periods.”
“We look at the traditions around the solstice for those cultures, or Christmas, too, depending on the culture,” she said.
This year’s production will look at Mexican, Irish, and Jewish cultures set in Ellis Island in the 1920s, Sur said.
The celebration concluded at Grendel’s Den, which hosted an Oktoberfest after-party featuring the 20th annual keg tapping ceremony.

Student groups at Harvard are celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month by hosting cultural events and discussions on campus.
Hispanic Heritage Month, which aims to recognize the histories and cultures of Latinx Americans, spans from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15.
The student organization Fuerza Latina hosted its inaugural cultural fair on Saturday. The event, called Ritmo Latino, showcased the cultural traditions and foods of more than 10 Latin countries.
Alejandra Beltran ’25, the social chair of Fuerza Latina, said she was inspired to plan the event to bring students of different Hispanic cultures together.
“Since this event includes all of the countries that don’t even have an organization, it’s the first time something like this has ever happened,” she said.
The fair featured cuisine from the Latinx diaspora, with a decorated table for each country represented. Several student cultural groups and individuals also performed during the event.
“The point of this event is that it’s a cultural showcase, so every country is going to have a small presentation,” Beltran said. “When the event finishes we encourage everyone to go through every table to have a little sample of food from every country.”
Beltran added that planning the event required significant, yet fulfilling hard work.
“The only thing we are getting out of this is sharing our passion and a piece of home with each other,” she said.
Kilbert Baez-Arias ’24, president of the Dominican Student Association, also praised the interchange between Latinx student groups at Ritmo Latino.
“I think that it’s a great way for there to be collaboration amongst the different groups, so that we just kind of feel a lot more connected to each other,” he said.
The Harvard Foundation and the Phillips Brooks House Association also teamed up to celebrate Latinx heritage by co-hosting a screening of the documentary “Latino Pioneers in Boston” on Thursday.
Matias Ramos, associate director of the Harvard Foundation, said the film highlights the considerable contributions and perseverance of Latinx Pioneers in the Boston area.
“Today’s stories show the breadth of experiences and approaches that Latino community leaders have taken over the last 50 years to make a difference in Boston,” he said. “They worked together with others to create a shared voice and to bring demands forward that advanced access to education, representation in media, political power, and organizing.”
Ramos added that the screening has important takeaways for students, such as the “humility and empathy and kindness” illustrated in the film’s stories.
“No matter where you come from, you have a special ability,” he said. “But it takes commitment, and it takes not just one day and not just rhetoric, but action and negotiation and coming together with others and meeting them where they're at.”
Phillip Brooks House Association Executive Director Maria Dominguez Gray said she hopes the screening showed students the connection between Harvard and the Latinx population of Boston.
“Sometimes we stay in our bubbles,” she said. “And it's really important for us as part of the Latinx community here to know the story of our local communities.”
Dominguez said she hopes students will feel a call to action to engage with and assist individuals outside of Harvard’s campus.
“My specific hope is that while we're here, we realize we're part of a greater community outside of the campus,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke ’75 was one of three recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economics Monday morning.
He becomes the 32nd Nobel laureate to have graduated from Harvard College and the second College alum awarded a Nobel Prize in 2022, after Carolyn R. Bertozzi ’88 received the award for her work in chemistry last week.
With Bernanke’s award, Harvard has now seen 36 of its current and former instructors or alumni take home the prize in economics. Harvard-affiliated winners account for roughly 40 percent of the 92 total laureates in economic sciences since the category was added in 1968.
Bernanke shares the prize with Douglas W. Diamond, a professor at the University of Chicago, and Philip H. Dybvig, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, “for research on banks and financial crises.”
“The laureates’ insights have improved our ability to avoid both serious crises and expensive bailouts,” Tore Ellingsen, Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said in a Nobel Committee press release.
In a press conference, Bernanke said the prize was “completely unexpected.”
“My wife and I shut off our cell phones when we went to bed last night,” he said. “It was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted, and called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened.”
After graduating from the College summa cum laude and as a member of academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa, the former Winthrop House resident attended MIT for his Ph.D. before teaching at Stanford, MIT, NYU, and Princeton, where he chaired the economics department for six years.
He chaired the Council of Economic Advisors under U.S. President George W. Bush, before serving two terms as Chairman of the Federal Reserve — a role he held throughout the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
Bernanke returned to Cambridge to deliver the 2008 Class Day address and briefly appeared in the 2016 Winthrop House Housing Day video, in which he declared that “Winthrop House is money in the bank.”

This is my (in)formal petition that Harvard needs to create more ~study~ spaces on campus because at this point I can name more not-so-secret-secret-societies than locations to pull an all nighter grind out a paper at this school.
You may be asking, “What’s so bad about current study spots?”
Cabot Library
No matter what time of day it is you’ll hear freshmen yelling over their overdue psets while complaining about how Cabot is *freezing*. As an upperclassman, I may look like a freshman but there is no way I’m risking catching the freshmen plague to study at this disruptive, crowded space filled with wide-eyed 18 year-olds who are pulling consecutive all-nighters.
Lamont Library
Lamont is truly what I imagine the concept of depression to be in architectural form. When I come there I end up staring at a yellow wall, instead of doing my neuroscience pset. Something about Lamont makes me want to ponder the concept of human existence, have my mid-life crisis at the ripe age of 19, and fall into a deep sleep all at the same time.
Widener Library
Whenever doing anything at Widener, I feel like I’m an undercover spy under constant surveillance. It feels like all eyes are on me every minute I spend there. Pulling out a chair makes this loud scratchy nose that breaks the utter silence that was once in place, and you have distracted *everyone*. On that note, I promise you I spent more time checking if my airpods are connected than studying at Widener because I don’t want any more attention from these people than I have already suffered from. Hot take: this famous library definitely has more use as a photoshoot location than as a proper study location.
Smith Campus Center
I come here to romanticize my studying but then I simply fall ~asleep~ in the comfy tenth floor chairs along with everyone else up there. I swear it’s something about those chairs.
Dining Halls
Here me out: I love people, but the dhall is too people-y. Please don’t come talk to me when I am ~gracefully~ trying to finish a p-set due in one hour.
House Libraries
A glorified, pretty room with desks and chairs, who wouldn’t come here to study? If I wanted to study in a crowded little room, I may have more luck doing so in a tiny hallway double. Seeing the same sad people with the same deadened look in their eyes doesn’t exactly do wonders for the typical studious student.
I’m manifesting more study spaces for you and your friends, so you have one less excuse to procrastinate on that p-set. We’re in this together <3.
