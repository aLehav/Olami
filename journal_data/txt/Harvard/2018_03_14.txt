After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
{image id=1329125 align=left size=large caption="Patricia Kalember, Jim Poulos, and Karen Pittman in "The White Card."""}
The audience is split through the middle into two sections of white chairs facing one another.The stage lies in between. The walls are white. The entire set is white. Bright, harsh lights fill the room. When the show begins, the lights barely dim, continuing to make the whiteness all too clear. Playwright and poet Claudia Rankine’s play, “The White Card,” directed by Diana Paulus, is showing at the Emerson Paramount Theater from Feb. 24 to Apr. 1. It blurs the line between performance and reality, digging through the past to unearth contemporary truths about race and oppression. Set in upper-class New York, the play captures a dinner hosted at the home of Charles (Daniel Gerroll) and Virginia (Patricia Kalember), a wealthy white couple who curate and collect artwork. They invite erudite art dealer Eric (Jim Poulos), their activist and undergraduate son Alex (Colton Ryan), and renowned black artist Charlotte (Karen Pittman). The couple, in a bid to buy Charlotte’s art, organize a dinner party of sorts, but the conversation quickly devolves into a nuanced, powerful discussion on the intersection of art, race, and responsibility.
“The White Card” demands as much from its audience as its actors, drawing spectators to see the world recreated on stage as simply that: a recreation of what Rankine calls the “fault line between black and white lives.” As the play progresses, Charles’s passion for collecting art unfolds to reveal darker roots. This performance takes the shape of a conversation between the characters, and also between the audience members, who look across at each other and the stage as the play unfolds. Rankine approaches structural racism through the lens of white philanthropy, challenging the idea of the white savior and turning a critical eye to the implications of white benevolence.
“Black people have never been human,” Charlotte says. She speaks during a heated encounter with Charles, pointing out that the art he collects—memorabilia of  black suffering—not only reduces these painful experiences to mere artwork, but also desensitizes people to the brutality of racial discrimination.
In the second act of the play, Charlotte shows Charles her most recent artworks: a series of photographs of Charles and Virginia socializing at New York’s top art galleries and museums. She asks Charles whether—for all his patronage of black art—he has ever stopped to consider how he unknowingly facilitates racial discrimination in different aspects of his life. Charles challenges his own legacy, unravelling as he grapples with his good intentions and his philanthropy, realizing that they amount to little more than “shopping for black death,” as Charlotte puts it. His art patronage is not the solution to understanding or coming to terms with years of racism. Rather, it is antithetical to the solution, rendering black lives synonymous with suffering.
The dialogue is pointed and poetic. The witty repartee flows between the characters like two sides of the same coin, arguing fundamentally different views of race: one from a white perspective, and the other from a black perspective. Paulus’s cast, composed of accomplished Broadway and off-Broadway actors, delivers a moving performance, rich with raw emotion and a hunger for the truth. Charles and Charlotte are particularly fantastic, bringing complex ideas about race to the forefront. Engaging and incisive, the plot does not devolve into a lecture on race, but instead portrays a genuine human struggle to understand the roles we must assume to subvert oppressive institutions and biases.
At its heart, “The White Card” aims to spark nuanced conversations, which are years overdue. Yet, the performance does not end with the final act. Rather, it urges its audience to stay behind and break into groups to discuss race with candor and compassion. “The White Card” is the play that never ends, finding life in the fight against the systematic oppression of the black community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 6, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to include the College’s penalties for members of unrecognized single-gender social groups in the student handbook. With this vote comes the understanding that the sanctions have been officially codified. The sanctions also now have an enforcing body—the Administrative Board—to weigh all student violations.
Upon the unveiling of the implementation process last week, the Office of Student Life expressed an expectation that the Ad  Board would be in charge of adjudicating all social group cases. Indeed, this Faculty vote has now made this expectation concrete. We are pleased by the fact that, as a result of this decision, the sanctions can now be implemented, and that some progress has been made in a nearly two-year-long saga of administrative delay. This is a welcome first step of conciliation, hopefully ensuring that students who choose to participate in single-gender organizations face defined consequences under the policy.
In accordance with what we have written in the past, however, we still do not believe the policy and its implementation process have been adequately explained to all undergraduates. Given the significance of the penalties, we stress that the College has failed to develop a complete and transparent policy. This is the unfortunate result of a nearly two-year-long process full of motions, votes, and committees that has left many students and faculty uncertain as to which groups the sanctions affect and how the implementation process will occur.
Thus, we expect further communication and transparency from the administration about the policy’s exact guidelines and enforcement mechanisms. One suggestion would be to hold required meetings or dialogues concerning the policy for all incoming freshmen during Opening Days. Additionally, it would be helpful to hold similar events to serve as reminders for all upperclassmen affected by the policy.
Additionally, while the Faculty vote is a large step in the right direction with concrete ramifications, the fight against two major issues cited by the administration in the development of the sanctions—exclusivity and sexual harassment—should not end here. As helpful as the sanctions may be in ameliorating these problems, they are still only one way to address them.
Therefore, we hope that any and all efforts to address these issues across the entire College—not simply those limited to the social organizations in question—not only continue, but also grow and improve. We expect the College to not only increase dialogue, but to take even more concrete steps. We hope that campus climate will ultimately measurably improve for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Diving crews worked over the weekend to temporarily “restore” the Harvard Sailing Center, which began sinking into the Charles River last week in the wake of a strong nor’easter.
The sailing center, located in the heart of Boston between the Longfellow and Massachusetts Ave. bridges, houses the College's varsity sailing team boats. At the lowest point of its sink across the past few days, the building dipped roughly six feet into the water.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in a press release Thursday that the sailing center began sinking into the river due to a flotation device failure. In days since, though, University officials have said they are uncertain about the official cause.
Workers from Semper Diving and Marine, a commercial dive company specializing in marine construction and inspection, started trying to pump and raise the facility as early as Friday, according to the Boston Globe.
These attempts were ultimately successful, according to University representative Aaron M. Goldman.
"Crews from Semper Diving and Marine were hard at work throughout the weekend and were successful in temporarily restoring the condition of the Sailing Center, to stem any further damage to the structure,” Goldman wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
Workers from Clean Harbors—which offers environmental, energy, and industrial services including waste disposal—were also on site to help repair the building over the weekend.
Clean Harbors Vice President David Proud confirmed that the company “was called in” by Harvard.
“We set [a] containment boom around the structure to contain any floating material,” he wrote in an email Monday.
Sailing captain Jessica R. Williams wrote in an email that, when the team drove out of Boston on Sunday for its spring break training session in Maryland, the boathouse was “floating above water.”
Goldman wrote the next step is to ensure the repairs are permanent.
“In the coming days, crews will work to make these repairs permanent and we will share further updates as they become available,” he wrote.
Scalise and Assistant Director of Athletics Daniel J. O’Brien did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last-minute defeat to Penn in Sunday’s Ivy League Championship game may still sting in the hearts of the Crimson fanbase, but Harvard men’s basketball will have at least one more contest to showcase its season and represent the conference.
For the first time since 2011, the team will be competing in the National Invitational Tournament, or NIT, by virtue of winning the regular-season Ivy League title.
The first-round matchup between No.7 Harvard (18-13, 12-2 Ivy) and No.2 Marquette (19-13, 9-9 Big East) gives the Crimson another opportunity to square up against a top-rated Division I opponent on national television, as the game will be featured on ESPN2 at 7 PM Wednesday night.
The other unignorable storyline: Harvard coach Tommy Amaker will reunite with former Duke graduate Steve Wojciechowski for the first time in both coaches’ careers. The current Marquette coach, known informally as “Wojo”, followed a near identical player-to-coach path as Amaker. Wojciechowski was a point guard under Coach Mike Krzyzewski between 1994-1998 before joining the Blue Devils coaching staff for 16 years.
In two of those four playing seasons, Wojo’s associate head coach was Amaker, who subsequently accepted a head coaching position at Seton Hall after 10 seasons as a Duke assistant and four seasons as Coach K’s point guard from 1983-1987. For Wojciechowski, this Duke connection remains as strong as ever.
“I love Tommy Amaker,” Wojciechowski said. “He’s one of the finest people and classiest men not just in college basketball but in general. He is an incredible coach. He’s done a fantastic job at Harvard and we know that they are really good. It is going to be a very difficult game, but it is not me and him playing one-on-one. It’s Marquette versus Harvard.”
While Amaker decided to lead his first program in northern New Jersey, the former Blue Devils associate head coach from 2008-2014 staked his first lead job in Milwaukee, Wisc., with the Marquette Golden Eagles of the Big East. Since taking over in 2014, Wojo’s Golden Eagles have made one NCAA Tournament appearance with a 31-41 overall conference record.
This season, Marquette finished .500 in the Big East and finished right outside of the March Madness bubble. Quality wins against VCU, LSU, and Wisconsin highlighted a 9-3 non-conference schedule, but an inability to defeat top-tier Big East opponents such as Villanova and Xavier as well as losses to bottom feeders like DePaul and St. John’s put the Golden Eagles in a precarious position come Selection Sunday.
In the Big East Tournament played at Madison Square Garden, Marquette advanced to the quarterfinals after narrowly edging out DePaul 72-69 but lost to No.2 Villanova by 24 to end its conference season.
“The Big East is such a tough conference, in my opinion the best in the country,” sophomore guard Markus Howard said. “To see those teams make the tournament, as they should, we are happy for them. But at the same time, we know we deserve to be there as well...we are just working with what we have and looking forward to continuing to grow as a team.”
Howard and redshirt senior Andrew Rowsey will be the Crimson’s two main defensive challenges on a three-point shooting heavy team. Although neither Howard nor Rowsey stand above six feet tall, the two backcourt shooters have put up the bulk of Marquette’s shooting numbers.
Both guards are averaging more than 20 points per game during the season and have combined for 212 triples on the season at around a .400 clip. As a team, the Golden Eagles hold the eighth highest made threes in the NCAA at 354 and the fourth highest shooting percentage from deep, at .415.
Harvard did hold conference opponents to a 32.1 percent rate from three-point range and had the best defensive field goal percentages in the Ivies, but this matchup against Marquette will certainly be at a higher level. Crimson guards Christian Juzang and Rio Haskett will likely see much of the backcourt defensive responsibilities, with team defensive “MVP” Justin Bassey also contributing important minutes.
One critical unknown for the game will be the health of sophomore forward Seth Towns. In the Ivy Championship against Penn, the current Ivy League Player of the Year fell to the ground with eight minutes remaining. Unable to reenter the game with an apparent knee injury, Towns will most likely be held out of the Wednesday contest if there is any concern about his long-term health. As of Tuesday afternoon, there has been no official word from the team about Towns’ status.
Losing Towns with sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken already out for the season only reduces Harvard’s odds at an upset. The Crimson willed itself to 13-0 run when Towns first checked out of the contest against Penn, but could not close out Sunday’s back-and-forth thriller with its leading scorer on the bench.
“Not sure where [Seth] is in terms of the status of his injury,” said Amaker after Sunday’s Penn loss. “ So I don’t know anything about that at this point, but it certainly wasn’t easy. We still had opportunities to push through and I was very proud of our kids for battling like that without Seth.”
Even without Towns, the Crimson still feature a supporting cast of young talent, one that Wojciechowski highlighted when praising his former coach.
“I know what a job Tommy has done there,” Wojo said. “He has recruited like crazy there. If this was the old Ivy League they would be in the NCAA Tournament. I know they have a couple of really good young pieces and so do we. This will be great for both programs.”
One of those heavily recruited and talented players—sophomore forward Chris Lewis—will face up against 6-foot-10 junior big Matt Heldt, who is sixth in the Big East in blocks at 0.9 rejections per game. Given Marquette’s guard-heavy offense, Lewis may not need to extend himself outside of the paint as much as he did against Cornell’s Stone Gettings or Penn’s AJ Brodeur. Nevertheless, 6-foot-8 sophomore wing Sam Hauser and freshman forward Jamal Cain will pose new defensive challenges to the Harvard frontcourt.
Another notable facet of the NIT Tournament will be the introduction of experimental rules, which will certainly affect the way in which Amaker employs his “inside-out” offense. Of note is the widened paint area from 12 feet to 16 feet, as well as the extension of the three-point line by 1 foot and 8 inches.
This will likely push Harvard’s primary post presence in Lewis outwards, and make it more challenging for guards like Haskett, Juzang, and Bassey to reach the interior with defenders picking up their marks further out in the perimeter. The Crimson’s slow and methodical offensive pace will also be tested through another one of the new rules, as teams only having 20 seconds compared to 30 seconds of time on the shot clock after an offensive rebound.
Adding onto its matchup challenges, Harvard will also be playing in front of a sold-out home crowd. Although Marquette games are typically played in BMO Bradley Center in Milwaukee—home of the NBA’s Bucks—this contest will instead by held on campus at the Al McGuire Center. Within seven hours of ticket availability on Monday, the 3,700-seat women’s volleyball and basketball complex had completely sold-out. This includes the 500 tickets that Wojo had purchased for any students still on campus during the university’s spring break holiday.
To put it short, the Crimson will certainly be playing with a bounty of difficult but familiar challenges including a hostile environment(see Palestra), injuries to star players(see Aiken), and defensive responsibilities against elite perimeter weapons(see Matt Morgan). In a season filled with adversity and up-and-down play, Harvard will need a strong game from Lewis and the supporting cast to prolong its season and earn a program-defining victory against the Golden Eagles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the wake of last weekend’s NCAA Northeastern Regionals, the Harvard fencing teams will send 10 fencers to the 2018 NCAA Championships at Penn State on March 21st.
At nationals, epee will be represented entirely by freshmen with Charlie Horowitz on the men’s front while Cindy Gao and Saanchi Kukadia compete for the women. Foil features a greater diversity of class with freshman Geoffrey Tourette, sophomore George Haglund and women’s co-captain MacKenzie Lawrence all fencing in crimson. In sabre, four fencers in the form of sophomores Erwin Cai and Marta Lasota as well as juniors Gabrielle Tartakovsky and men’s co-captain Eli Dershwitz will have their time to fight in the national spotlight.
The national qualifiers list comes one day after Harvard competed in its annual regional bout. The Crimson sent 19 fencers the NCAA Northwestern Regionals. From there, it was all freshmen with Tourette winning gold for the men’s foil and Kukadia ascending the podium in women’s epee. Overall, of the 19 fencers 10 finished in the top 10 spots within their respective divisions.
MEN
A squad of ten fencers represented the No. 2 Harvard men’s team at the NCAA Regional tournament hosted by Brandeis Sunday. Of those, six finished in the top 10 of their respective divisions.
Tourette headlined for the team, bringing home the gold in the foil division. The freshman left Waltham, Mass., flaunting a 20-3 record and a plus-66 point differential. A great first round paved the way for the rookie’s success later in the tournament. In round one, Tourette racked up a perfect 6-0 record and accumulated a plus-24 touch differential to supplement the feat. Round two featured two losses but a near perfect performance in pool play propelled Tourette to the top of his division. Teammate Haglund provided his one loss of the third round.
Haglund did well himself, breaking the top ten in the division with an eighth place finish. The sophomore finished with an overall 12-12 record. Classmates Duncan Rheingans-Yoo and Matt Branman rounded out the foil division with 13th and 14th place, respectively.
All three fencers in the sabre division broke the top 10, with Dershwitz leading the squad. The junior co-captain racked up a perfect 12-0 record through the first two rounds of competition before dropping four of 11 in the final round. With his 19-4 record, Dershwitz took fourth place. Both Cai and Guy mirrored each other in the first two rounds, both achieving records of 5-1 in round one and 4-2 in the second. In the final set of pool play, Cai went 5-6, claiming seventh, while Guy lost two more and placed 10th.
Horowitz rounded things out for the team in epee, placing sixth. After two rounds of 4-2 finishes, the rookie went 5-6 in his final round of bouts. Freshman Adrien Thein-Sandler also placed 20th in the division while junior Albert Chien finished 29th.
WOMEN
In the same place, at the same time, the No. 6 Harvard women’s fencing team sent nine of its fencers to the NCAA Northeast Regionals. The team returned to Cambridge with four top 10 finishes and a gold medal in tow.
Kukadia managed the Crimson squad bringing home the hardware for the women’s team. Following a bye in the inaugural round of fencing, the freshman managed 4-2 records in rounds two and three. In her final series of bouts, the rookie finished an impressive 9-2, locking in a 17-6 overall record and plus-36 touch differential.
Classmate Gao didn’t finish far behind, earning the sixth place spot in the division. Also with a bye in round one, the freshman posted a near perfect round two, 5-1, before dropping two in round three. In her final round, Gao dropped four of 11 to claim her spot at number six. Juniors Shawn Wallace and co-captain Sharon Ra also competed in the division earning 11th and 15th, respectively.
Both entrants in the sabre division of competition found their way to the top of the field. Placing fourth, Tartakovsky fielded 4-2 records and plus-11 touch differentials in both rounds two and three. In her last round of pool play, the junior dropped four of eleven. Teammate Lasota finished one step behind—in fifth. The sophomore started out perfect, hitting 6-0 before dropping three in the subsequent round to finish with a 16-7 overall record.
In the foil division, Lawrence led the group placing 11th as teammates sophomore Natalie Yang and junior Liana Henderson-Semel placed 16th and 19th, respectively.
