After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
There was something enchanting about the looping guitar and how it transformed in juxtaposition with the many faces at the crowded Park Street T stop. The music seemed to tell a story, but the subject was ambiguous. It somehow applied to everyone: the young mother with her son in her arms, the young couple kissing, the old couple holding hands, the sad faces and the happy ones. The tune was cheerful, twangy, and warm, yet melancholy. After quieting from an intricate climax, the music stopped. All those at the stop applauded.

I was afraid to interrupt the musician responsible for the music, a young man wearing a long-sleeve plaid shirt and glasses, and ask for an interview. When I finally mustered up the courage to do so he was hesitant to speak with me. Not because he was nervous about being interviewed—rather, he was afraid I would take too much of his attention away from his guitar. After some persuading he agreed to give me five minutes.
His name is Guaray Llama, and he first picked up a guitar as a child in Nepal, where he moved from only two and a half years ago. “Destiny,” he says, brought him to the U.S. He would not expand on what he meant, but he knows that he is not destined to work at a conventional job. 
“I used to work before at other places—like Staples here and there—but I thought about doing this, because this is my passion,” Llama says. And the heads he humbly admits to turning each day are what fuel him. “It’s good when your music is heard every day by a lot of people and they feel good. That’s what makes you do it day after day.” 
Llama showed me how he creates his pieces. He plays a line, steps on a pedal to record it and then loops that line back while he picks a new melody. When he first started he had a difficult time multitasking, “but now, it’s just as easy as strumming,” he says. After 17 years of playing guitar, it’s second nature.
Despite bonding over missing the mountains of our respective homelands—perhaps all Washington has in common with Nepal—when my five minutes were up Llama turned his attention back to his guitar and in no time, the T stop was once again filled with the sound of his music. As the Alewife train back home approached, my only regret was that it wasn’t running late.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the course of your career as a student at Harvard, there is a good chance that at some point you will live, or have lived, in a dorm where Dorm Crew is responsible for cleaning your bathrooms. You probably recognize the trademark Dorm Crew post-it note informing you of the name of the student who cleaned your bathroom. Maybe you spend one second thinking about that note and the person who stuck it to your mirror before crumbling it up and throwing it into your garbage can. My guess is you won’t think about Dorm Crew again until the next time that post-it note greets you in the mirror a few weeks later (that is, unless you’re complaining to your roommates about how Dorm Crew hasn’t come in a while.) This is understandable—if you come home to find your bathroom miraculously clean, why would you be anything other than pleasantly surprised, and simply leave it at that? Even further, why would you spend any considerable amount of time pondering the miracle-worker who removed the seemingly permanent, built-up toothpaste grime on the side of your sink? “What year are they? What are they studying? What are their goals in life? Which part of my bathroom was the most pleasant for them to clean?” Nobody wants to recognize consciously that a person other than oneself cleaned the disgusting mess one has made. It’s uncomfortable.
Which is why every time I knock on a door with my cleaning supplies bucket and mop pole in hand, I pray that nobody answers.  I bet that on a list of the most awkward situations in which Harvard students frequently find themselves, being in the room while a Dorm Crew worker cleans one’s bathroom is at the top. My experience goes a little something like this: The student answers the door slowly, still trying to anticipate whom their unexpected visitor could be. When they finally lay eyes on me, they always look a little perplexed. I’ve come to the conclusion that it takes them a good two seconds to process the chemicals and rags in my hand. They generally wait for me to initiate the conversation. “Hi, is now an okay time to clean your bathroom?” A hesitation. A glance inside the room. “Oh. Yeah, uh, sure.” They always sound unsure.
My presence is the discomfort that they never had to face when they would return to a magically sparkly-clean bathroom. I force them to confront the fact that another human being—not just any human being, a fellow student—is literally the one wiping up their shit. I also recognize that they feel awkward about the situation because they are good people. Call me naïve or optimistic, but I generally sense a hint of guilt when they point me in the direction of their bathroom. And when students thank me for my work, I can tell that it is sincere.
So here is my message for all you good-hearted, well-intentioned students out there who will likely come across this situation at some point. This situation is only awkward if you make it awkward.  So first, don’t feel bad about the fact that the Dorm Crew worker is cleaning your bathroom! We signed up for it and we knew what we were getting ourselves into. Think about the opportunity to clean your bathroom as an opportunity for us to make more money. Second, remind yourself that we are just your fellow peers. We have hobbies, interests, friends, and clubs that we’re a part of, just like you—so you shouldn’t feel like there’s anything separating you from us. If you have a free moment, come chat for a bit. I can’t express how much I’ve enjoyed the conversations I’ve had with strangers while cleaning their bathrooms. Finally, always, always, always say thank you. As a worker I really do appreciate that simple expression of gratitude (and I might just put a little extra elbow grease into that dirty bathtub of yours). Not only does it let me know that you appreciate the work that Dorm Crew does, but it also gives me the chance to respond with a statement that couldn’t be truer: “You’re welcome. It is my pleasure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Faust,
 
Just three days after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its dire plea for global action on climate change, you closed the door on the University’s biggest chance to make a difference—divestment from fossil fuel companies. Certain segments of the Harvard community, which stand in overwhelming support of divestment, requested a public forum to discuss the future of the world’s largest university endowment. You rejected our request for open dialogue while putting forth many misleading and incorrect statements about divestment.
 
The suggestion that divestment from fossil fuels would be ineffective is contradicted by both experience and logic. Divestment played a critical role in turning the tide against South Africa’s apartheid regime and in spurring a regulatory response to the lies and political manipulation of the tobacco industry. A recent Oxford University study concluded: "In every case we reviewed, divestment campaigns were successful in lobbying for restrictive legislation." According to those researchers, the “stigmatization process, which the fossil fuel divestment campaign has now triggered, poses the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies and the vast energy value chain."  
 
As Harvard students, we understand that America’s legal and democratic institutions have broken down. The fossil fuel industry, like the tobacco industry before it, has pursued a corrupt agenda of misinformation and political lobbying designed to prevent scientific consensus from informing public policy. 
 
As a result, Congress has proven incapable of passing any meaningful climate legislation, instead offering billions in subsidies to destructive companies at taxpayer expense. Our generation cannot wait any longer to unwind the fossil fuel industry’s stranglehold on Congress. We must use influential, rational, and functioning institutions like Harvard to revoke the social license of the most dangerous and intractable industry in the world.
 
You claim that it is inconsistent to divest from the companies whose fossil fuels we rely on. The real inconsistency is to vainly hope that Harvard’s groundbreaking research will somehow solve climate change. Our research and education will not achieve the political change needed as long as the University invests in corporations that peddle climate denialism and actively prevent Harvard’s contributions from impacting public policy.
 
It is profoundly hypocritical to pay lip service to Harvard’s “strong institutional commitment to sustainability” while profiting from the destruction of our planet. If you are truly concerned about future generations of students, we recommend you value the future of their planet over the diversity of your corporation’s portfolio.
 
You argue that divestment would be inappropriately political. The biggest misconception about the endowment is not that divestment would be financially destructive but that our continued investment in the fossil fuel industry is politically neutral. Investing in the wreckage of our planet is inherently political.
 
Last semester, Harvard Law Students voted two-to-one to support immediate divestment of the University’s endowment from direct holdings in the top 200 fossil fuel companies and to divest from commingled funds within the next five years. Today, we renew our call for divestment and reiterate that neither we nor this issue are going away. With over 1300 Harvard students, 173 faculty, and 571 alumni signed on for divestment, this is not an issue that can be ignored or swept under the rug. We will continue to draw the world’s attention to Harvard’s destructive investment practices—because if it is wrong to wreck the planet, it is wrong to profit from climate destruction.
 
This is a battle over the purpose of Harvard University. The students, faculty, and alumni in favor of divestment believe Harvard should be more than a hedge fund. We believe that the Harvard motto, “Veritas,” is more than just a slogan. We are only doing what Harvard has taught and prepared us to do—standing up for what is right, even in the face of strong opposition. And we believe it will take the world’s most renowned academic institution to reign in the world’s most wealthy, powerful, and destructive corporations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, many students opened their dorm room doors to the friendly face of a 27-year-old Harvard undergraduate seeking their support for his bid for a seat on the Cambridge City Council. While Logan Leslie ’16 at first charmed much of the Harvard community with free bottle openers and promises to deliver to them the representation he thinks they deserve, his campaign soon sparked controversy. For one, Leslie’s belief that students should hold a seat on the City Council has drawn criticism. Leslie’s language, especially the parts of his platform concerning Cambridge’s homeless population, has also hardened some hearts on campus.
While we do not believe that students should feel entitled to a seat on the City Council, we are supportive of the idea of student candidates and particularly of candidates who seek to bridge the town-gown divide.
Leslie argues that, since students constitute approximately one-fifth of the Cambridge population, a student should occupy one of the nine City Council seats. We find arguments that suggest students are not entitled to any representation unconvincing—Harvard students are just as much Cambridge residents as Cantabrigians who do not attend the school, even if the majority of Harvardians do not pay property taxes. Along these same lines, however, we do not think students have more of a claim to a certain proportion of City Council seats than any other group. Student candidates should be judged on the merits of their policy ideas and administrative abilities alone.
All the same, we appreciate that a Harvard student has expressed interest in engaging with local politics, since only good can come from increased student participation of local politics. Additionally, student involvement in Cambridge politics could go a long way toward fostering a better relationship between Harvard and the rest of Cambridge, bringing both parties in greater tune with each other’s needs and desires. To his credit, Leslie’s platform explicitly includes a mission centered on bringing the Harvard and Cambridge communities together. The question is whether he has a realistic understanding of the problems that face the community as a whole.
Leslie’s campaign has come under fire for using what some consider disrespectful language concerning the homeless population of Cambridge, whom he has called an “embarrassment.” This language may belie Leslie’s assertion of understanding—or attempting to understand—the community beyond Johnston Gate. But after Leslie faced these accusations in an op-ed published in The Crimson, his campaign manager stated that he has had conversations about appropriate ways to modify his platform.
Leslie’s candidacy is a positive sign of increased student involvement in Cambridge’s political scene, involvement that could lead to a closer connection between Harvard and the world just outside its walls. While we have our doubts that Leslie’s fixation on the question of student representation is proportional to that issue’s importance as a challenge facing the city, we are glad that his campaign has ignited interest in local politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, I was an “Asian tourist” on Harvard's campus. “Stand there in front of the statue, let’s get a picture,” my mother called loudly in Mandarin. “And then you can ask that girl to take a picture of our whole family.” Behind us, families and tour groups chattered impatiently, waiting for their turn.
Now, a year later, I’m a Harvard student, newly initiated into a culture of contempt for tourists—and “Asian tourists” in particular. Beside the tradition of urinating on the internationally revered statue foot, Harvard students reserve an especially derisive tone for the broad category of “Asian tourists,” which can include both travel groups directly from Japan and China, as well as Asian-American families like mine. Common characteristics reserved for the archetypal “Asian tourist” include snapping seemingly gratuitous pictures with expensive cameras in front of every building, standing in the middle of every path we need to walk on, and speaking loudly in languages other than English. In the Harvard student community, a norm has emerged of vicious mockery and disdain for “Asian tourists,” ranging from imitation of Asian accents in everyday conversation to deliberate sabotaging of photography attempts.
This culture of contempt hurts me, because I know that not so long ago, my family was part of that mercilessly mocked demographic. My mother may have been the stereotypical Asian tourist—but she too deserves basic respect.
In the few months that I’ve been on campus so far, I’ve heard a myriad of both legitimate and trivial complaints about Asian tourists, and even some comments that border on downright racism. Freshmen in particular circulate stories about visitors peeking into windows in the early morning and taking pictures on the steps in the afternoon. “Wake up in the morning and I swear the entire continent of Asia has been transplanted to my yard,” one student wrote on social media. Harvard boasts a daily stream of both domestic and international tourists hailing from all over the world, yet the “Asian tourist” demographic is reserved a special form of vitriol.
Some of the perceived rudeness arises from cultural misunderstandings. Cultural norms about privacy, speaking volume, and appropriateness of photography vary widely from country to country. Travelers from countries like China, where globalization has only recently made international travel affordable for the middle class, may simply be uninformed about American etiquette. Because overseas travel is a new luxury, what we perceive as rudely speaking too loudly or poking into off-limit spaces might simply be chalked up to cultural differences. First-time visitors to any location are often simply unaware of cultural norms that they are inadvertently breaking. Anyone who has traveled abroad can surely empathize with the experience.
Other behaviors, such as the simple desire to walk around and take pictures, come from pure admiration and our prestige as an international institution. As students, jaded to the glamor of Harvard, focused only on our next problem set, it’s hard to understand why a large group of visitors is chattering enthusiastically outside our yard at seven o’clock in the morning. Yet in her 2009 column, “Touring the Ivory Tower,” Crimson columnist Silpa Kovvali ’10 described how we should consider Harvard from the lens of an outsider. “In the international community,” Kovvali wrote, Harvard is “not just another name in a pile of applications or another campus to visit. It is a beacon of educational excellence and a pinnacle of achievement, and it’s no surprise that the occasional tour group wants to admire its buildings, and sometimes its students.” The prestige that drew these tourists is the same world-class reputation that we benefit from every day in our wealth of classes, resources, and renowned faculty.
Of course, a few complaints from students about the invasiveness of prying tourist eyes have their grounds. When strangers peer into our first floor dorm rooms, point at our furniture, and exclaim, “Look, a bed,” we feel, as many students put it, “like animals in a zoo”—dehumanized and disrespected. Openly gawking in our private dorm spaces is a legitimate intrusion into our space. Although the tourists might not be ill intentioned, we are upset by their failure to respect our basic humanity.
But in our relentless derision and contempt, are we not failing to respect theirs?
As a school that prides itself on diversity, acceptance, and cross-cultural understanding, we can do better. Next time we see a large group of Asian tourists, wielding iPads and Nikons, taking turns taking pictures in front of the John Harvard statue, try to think of them as people. People with genuine admiration for our school. People from a different cultural context with some understandable cultural misunderstandings. People who deserve respect for their basic humanity.
One of them just might be my mom.

The Delphic Trust, which operates the Delphic Club, has filed a civil action suit against the President and Fellows of Harvard College and a construction company—Shawmut Woodworking & Supply, Inc.—for negligence and nuisance, according to court proceedings released by the Middlesex Superior Court.
The Trust is attempting to recover monetary damages of approximately $300,000 from Harvard and the construction company for allegedly damaging the Delphic’s rain leader system during the renovation of the Hasty Pudding Club building. According to the complaint, the project caused subsequent water damage to the Delphic Club when the system failed to operate properly during a heavy rainstorm in January 2012.
The Pudding building, which was previously known as the New College Theatre and has since been renamed Farkas Hall, is located at 10-12 Holyoke St., adjacent to the Delphic Club at 9 Linden St.
The complaint—filed by the Delphic Trust on Oct. 18—said that members of the Trust had met with Harvard officials before renovations began to “discuss the planned renovations of the Pudding and the impact of those renovations on the [Delphic]” and to advise Harvard to take precautions during the renovations so as not to damage any of the pipes in the Delphic’s system.
While Harvard allegedly agreed to investigate the drainage system behind the Delphic Club, the Trust declared in its tort action that no one ever did so, leading to the damage of the system.
Harvard completed the renovation of the Pudding building in 2007. According to the filings, the Trust began to notice signs of water damage to the Delphic clubhouse in 2011, including “mold in the basement” and non-functioning drains in the patio. After the 2012 rainstorm, which resulted in partial flooding of the building and damage to the patio, the Trust began investigating the cause of the overflow.
The investigation revealed, according to the court docket, that one of the pipes in the Delphic’s rain leader system had been crushed by “installations of drywall and concrete” believed to be carried out by Shawmut during the renovations of the Pudding.
The complaint cites numerous repairs that the Trust had to undertake in order to repair the water damage to the Delphic, including re-routing the entirety of the underground rain leader system, renovating several basement rooms, repairing the patio, and removing mold.
Since the rainstorm, the Trust has sought the blueprints of the Pudding’s renovation. According to the docket, Harvard representatives have so far failed to deliver such blueprints, although they allegedly promised to do so.
While the Delphic Trust is suing both Harvard and Shawmut for negligence, the Trust has also leveled a nuisance charge against the University, alleging that Harvard’s actions “have created a substantial and unreasonable interference with the Trust’s use and enjoyment of the [Delphic Club].”
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email to The Crimson that Harvard had not yet been served with a copy of the complaint and so was not in a position to comment on this suit.Delphic Club president Owen Fox ’13 declined to comment on the case in question.

Comedian and bestselling author Kathy M. Griffin received the inaugural Distinguished Service Partner Award to commemorate her work with veterans during a charity benefit hosted by the Harvard Undergraduates Honoring Veterans this Saturday.
After a performance by the improvisational comedy group Immediate Gratification Players, Griffin participated in a conversation with Undergraduate Council Finance Committee Chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14 on topics ranging from her work with veterans groups to life as a female comedian. “My involvement is built around laughter truly being the best medicine,” Griffin said in an interview with The Crimson after the event. “What I learned was that these men and women need to laugh at these moments, more than ever.”
Griffin, who has toured Iraq and Afghanistan with the United Service Organizations, also gives tickets to her comedy shows to the Veteran Tickets Foundation, allowing veterans to come free of charge and meet her after the show.
“It’s really one of my favorite things about touring, meeting these people every show,” Griffin said. “I love to hear their stories, and everybody’s story is so different.”
HUHV, which works to bring awareness to veterans’ presence on the Harvard campus, planned the charity event to provide emotional relief to stress-affected veterans and demonstrate Harvard students’ support for the veteran community, according to the group’s president Naji A. Filali ’14.
Filali said that the Distinguished Service Partner Award was designed to honor an individual based on his or her selflessness and devotion, understanding of the situations combat soldiers and veterans face, and influence on the veteran community.
“Kathy is someone who has almost never turned down an opportunity to reach out to veterans and to put on pro bono comedy, so she was a rational choice,” Filali said. “Among comedians and among celebrities, she has been the face of veteran charity efforts, so she is our inaugural recipient, and we hope to have individuals who replicate her dedication in the future.”
Though the event was free for veterans, Harvard students and the general public were charged for tickets to the benefit, the proceeds of which will go to the Home Base Program, an organization that works to provide clinical care and support for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.
The Red Sox Foundation also donated a Jon Lester jersey, a Mike Napoli jersey and a Ryan Dempster baseball to be auctioned off after the event. The proceeds will also go to the Home Base Program.
Though Griffin uses laughter and comic relief to support the veteran community, she encourages others to help out in anyway they can.
“Now there’s such a myriad of ways to be involved, and you can be involved in a way that’s appropriate for you,” Griffin said. “You see somebody in uniform, and you just say hi, say thank you, and I found that for a lot of military members just a simple thank you goes a long way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of its 100th anniversary celebration, the Harvard School of Public Health hosted the Centennial Leadership Summit on Friday, bringing together public health academics and advocates for a day of discussion.
The summit focused on aligning the educational and research missions of the school towards  four major threats to global health: old and new pandemics, harmful physical and social environments, poverty and humanitarian crises, and failing health systems.
Julio Frenk, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, formally opened the event by looking forward to the next century of innovative development. Six small group discussions featuring experts in a range of fields followed, including one focused on failing health systems.
“You need to look at the surgeon who is about to make the incision and the minister of health who is making the systems decisions,” said Ashish Jha, a health policy professor at the School of Public Health. “I think a big part of improving care is about training leadership and giving them the tools to identify what is high quality health-care.”
Afternoon panel sessions featured discussions with ministerial-level leaders in health policy from the United States and abroad, all of whom varied in their unique paths to the field of public health.
“Some people came to this field to make a large-scale impact while others had an experience with a patient and knew that they were on the wrong side of the intervention,” said Harvey V. Fineberg ’67, the president of the Institute of Medicine and moderator for the afternoon. “These are what draw people to public health and this is what has brought us together.”
While some panelists highlighted specific technical problems in the healthcare system, others reflected on the prevailing trends in the field.
“We tend to approach public health quite ideologically, where everyone needs to ride behind it and act in a certain way,” Kelechi Ohiri, an advisor to the ministry of health in Nigeria, said. “The real world doesn’t work that way and we need to realize that but avoid being jaded or cynical.”
In line with the general theme of “responsibility” during the discussions, Howard Koh, the U.S. assistant secretary for health for the Department of Health and Human Services, said he first realized he had to do something about public health problems while in medical school.
“The attending [physician] would always end by saying, ‘You know, this is all due to tobacco; someone should do something about that,’” Koh said. “And I remember leaving asking who that would be. That is what started my career in public health.”
Pradit Sintavanarong, the minister of Public Health of Thailand, reflected upon the importance of the panel as part of the larger Centennial Celebration.
“Maybe government is not the place for some of the people to talk directly or openly because of the politics, but academia is a special place where people come with an open mind,” Sintavanarong said. “I think Harvard University can play a very important role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a symposium on digital education, Robert A. Lue, a biology professor and director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, said that Harvard needs donors’ support to lead research on innovation in teaching and learning.
Lue moderated a panel composed of Peter K. Bol, a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and vice-provost for advances in learning, Elisa New, an English professor, David J. Malan ’99, a computer science lecturer, and Doris Sommer, a professor of romance languages and literatures. The symposium drew an estimated 120 alumni, donors, and affiliates.
According to Bol, Harvard X’s goals include entering the fast-growing market of online education, sharing education with the rest of the world, and using online technology to improve teaching strategies.
“We have to recognize that online education is becoming a very, very large market,” Bol said, adding that Harvard, as a leading institution, needs to make its presence felt in this market space.
Bol also reported during the symposium that China X, the online version of his General Education course on Chinese history, will open this week.
Speaking about the impact of digital education beyond Harvard, Malan noted that about 150,000 people around the world are taking CS50x, the online version of the Harvard introductory computer science class.
Malan characterized as very “humbling and inspiring” the vast interest that students of all ages and from all backgrounds expressed in his online course.
“[Online education] has really made the world feel like a smaller place,” Malan said, referring to the interaction between online computer science students worldwide.
EdX has also made students’ learning experience “more deeply engaging,” said Bol, speaking about how the availability of class discussions online has helped students to actively delve into the class material and to speak up. Bol added that the structure and content of online classes are the result of ongoing research in new modes of learning and teaching.
COMMUNITY AND VALUES: RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
Before an audience of about 25 people, Economics professor Edward L. Glaeser moderated a symposium that examined the roles of both interpersonal interaction in an increasingly online world and the ongoing process of house renewal.
The panel included representatives from three different Harvard houses. Cabot House Masters Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana, Leverett House tutor Katie M. Derzon, and Radhika Jain ’14—a Quincy house resident and Crimson news comp director—all shared their experiences with the House system.
Speaking briefly before the panel, Brian D. Young '76, a member of the FAS Campaign’s Steering Committee, said the discussion focused on “the soul of Harvard,” arguing that the Houses are “much more than bricks and mortar.”
Glaeser told the audience that the Houses, and by extension the interactions that take place in them, are the true source of intellectual growth for students.
“The real learning at Harvard is not in the lecture hall, but outside, in dorm rooms, in dining halls, in the casual conversations that students have about ideas,” he said.
While Glaeser acknowledged the increasing importance of online education in the current system, he maintained that “there is nothing that…can get rid of the tremendous power of meeting face-to-face.”
BIG DATA: SURPRISING SOLUTIONS TO BIG QUESTIONS
Introducing a symposium on big data, University professor and prominent political scientist Gary King argued that teaching engineering and applied sciences as part of a liberal arts education provides students with an important understanding of the social, legal, and moral issues that arise from innovation.
“Whenever engineers can do something, they will do it,” King said. “That’s why we need the liberal arts people, sociologists, and politicians beside us to help change the rules of society.”
King along with fellow panelists—physics professor Efthimios Kaxiras, astronomy professor Alyssa A. Goodman, and government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere—presented big data projects that Harvard affiliates have spearheaded. The projects presented included one that used new analytical methods to estimate that 13 percent of social media posts, usually on the topic of collective action, are censored by the government in China. The project drew rousing applause from the audience of more than 100 attendees.
Kaxiras, founding director of the Institute for Applied Computational Science, said that a new Master’s degree program in Computational Science and Engineering could facilitate further applications of computation, such as in diagnosing and predicting heart disease. Goodman promoted the Harvard-developed Glue, a new Python package for interactive real-time visualization of multidimensional data, which will work with NASA’s James Webb telescope, the successor of the Hubble telescope.
Speaking to alumnae during the subsequent question-and-answer session, King said that big data analytics could even be applied to conserve and share the Harvard experiences of the audience.
“You have information within you that exists but evaporates when you graduate,” King said. “If we were to capture your experience with big data and feed it to the next Harvard student, that student has a more understood future.”
THE CREATIVE SPARK: THE ROLE OF ARTS AND HUMANITIES IN SOCIETY
A symposium moderated by Diana Sorensen, divisional dean of the arts and humanities, stressed the importance of the arts and humanities in modern society and the role of liberal arts in higher education.
Before the panel, Andrew L. Farkas ’82, a member of the steering committee for the FAS campaign, told the audience that he was working closely with Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith to develop funding specifically for the arts and humanities.
Farkas also described the transformation in his own relationship with the arts and humanities, from entering Harvard as a “self-professed Philistine” to his current fundraising efforts for the liberal arts. He said that the arts and humanities are a core part of the University.
“The development of a true liberal arts education builds what they’ve always called a ‘Renaissance man’,” he said. “Harvard has always excelled in this area, and I believe is now committed more than ever to seeing its own renaissance in the humanities.”
The panel included presentations from Humanities Center Director Homi K. Bhabha, Emma Dench, a professor of classics and history, Stephen J. Greenblatt, a professor of English, and Karen L. Thornber, a professor of comparative literature.
In her introduction, Sorensen described both the practical and aesthetic value of learning the arts and humanities.
“We are convinced that, in the classroom, we give our students the tools for conversation in the civic sphere, and also for the extraordinary pleasures of working with artistic materials, be it the verbal arts, music, film, or theater,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You all look surprisingly gleeful for people who are going to die rather soon,” said Carleton “Ziggy Rainbow” W. Kendrick ’68 during a humorous monologue he presented at the Class of 1968’s 45th year reunion cabaret show this past Saturday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The show has become a tradition for many Harvard reunions after members of the Class of 1968 first performed it at their 15th reunion, and is the longest running class reunion show in the history of Harvard College, according to the show’s music director and pianist Peter M. Larson ’68.
The class also set the record for highest attendance of any 45th class reunion in the College’s history.
“We love each other. We’ve been through a lot. That’s partially why we’re so successful,” Larson said.
Larson was accompanied in the pit by his wife Sue Larson ’68 on violin, Scott Johnson ’68 on guitar, Dave Buda ’68 on bass, and Mike Ambroszewski ‘68 on drums. Leading the progression of events, Ed M. Kovachy ’68 and Cort B. Casady ’68 served as the show’s masters of ceremony.
As alumni entered the main stage, former members of the class Glee Club harmonized from the third floor. By 8 p.m. there was not an empty seat to be found.
“They were the best audience we could hope for, except for mom and dad back in the day,” Kovachy said. “It’s a moment we wish could go on forever.”
Marshall M. Goldberg ’68 was the first to perform. Accompanied by the class’s Glee Club and the uproarious laughter of the audience, Goldberg performed “Hail ‘68,” a comedic ode to his classmates that included the lyrics: “Only we paid homage to the Shah”—referencing Shah of Iran Mohammed Reza Pahlavi’s commencement address that year—and “Just be happy you can still recall 1968.”
Other acts included a poetry reading from poet laureate Wendy M. Mnookin ’68, a storytelling from Stephen A. Michaels ‘68, a performance of Roger Miller’s “King of the Road” from Casady himself, and a personal rock concert from Austin S. de Lone ’68, co-founder of the band Eggs Over Easy.
“It’s a little undercooked when we put it on the stage, but that’s the nature of it. This is for us. We’ve got a little of everything” said Casady.
“The thing I didn’t predict was how fun it would be to reconnect with classmates. They’re a very generous audience,” he added, noting the feeling of nostalgia that accompanied the event.
As tradition dictates, the show concluded when the entire class rose together and sang The Beatles song “Hey Jude” in unison. According to Kovachy, planning for the 50th year reunion cabaret show will begin immediately.
“30 years of shows. Seven cabarets. It’s been amazing,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Raphael Girard recorded a 43-save shutout and sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo scored two goals as the Crimson opened its season with a 3-0 win over Bentley.
Girard stood tall in the crease for the Crimson despite the visitors controlling the flow for much of the first and third periods. While Harvard’s skaters were able to force most of Bentley’s opportunities to the outside, the junior from Quebec carried the team at times and made several tough stops in the final minutes to preserve the shutout.
“I thought Raphael Girard was outstanding all night,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “We can’t count on that kind of performance in the net every night.”
Four days earlier, Bentley had been limited to just 13 shots on goal in a 4-3 loss to No. 9 Quinnipiac. On Saturday, the Falcons managed to get more than three times as many pucks to the net, but met a goaltender who was on top of his game.
“He did make some great saves down the stretch that we needed, some tips from the outside that were big plays that we’re going to need our goalie to make all year,” Criscuolo said.
Harvard put the game out of reach for the Falcons with two goals spaced 13 seconds apart in the second period.
Tommy O’Regan provided Harvard’s first goal of the season just under 13 minutes into the second frame, directing a drop-pass in the slot from freshman center Sean Malone past the shoulder of Bentley goaltender Branden Komm.
Criscuolo struck moments later off the next face-off, intercepting the puck in the neutral zone and firing a shot that deflected off Komm’s helmet and off the back glass. Criscuolo recovered the rebound and put it between the pipes before Komm could locate the puck.
“It took a funny bounce off the goalie’s head, and I was lucky to put it in,” Criscuolo said. “We went out there [after the first goal] with the attitude just to get the puck deep.”
Criscuolo’s third goal came with just over three minutes left in regulation off a 2-on-1 break with freshman center Alexander Kerfoot. Kerfoot won a faceoff and carried the puck into the Bentley zone before connecting with Criscuolo in the slot.
While a broken hand kept Criscuolo out for the entire month of January last season, the sophomore looked healthier than ever on Saturday.
“[Criscuolo] got a little bit of a generous bounce on the second one, but I thought he was working,” Donato said. “I thought that second period he was tremendous.”
Harvard started slow despite three power play opportunities in the opening ten minutes of regulation.
“I thought that in the first period we were just sloppy,” Donato said. “We were a little bit selfish with the puck; we just didn’t have the puck-movement that we’ve had all week in practice.”
In the second period, the Crimson overcame inconsistencies and turnovers on both sides of the ice to generate opportunities with a game-best 19 shots in the middle frame.
Bentley’s frustrations mounted in the third as the Falcons put 17 shots on Girard to no avail. In the end, Girard skated away with his third career shutout.
In addition to Girard’s veteran strength in goal, the Crimson welcomed new offensive talent Saturday.
Kerfoot and Malone tallied key assists in their first NCAA game. The only two NHL draft picks in Harvard’s class of 2017 provided a glimpse of their dangerous playmaking abilities on the Crimson’s first and second lines, respectively.
“[Kerfoot’s] a through-and-through playmaker,” Criscuolo said of his new linemate. “He’s always looking to find different guys. He made me and [sophomore forward Jimmy] Vesey’s lives a lot easier out there.”
Harvard’s nine-player freshman class will figure prominently into its season this year. Freshman forwards Devin Tringale, Luke Esposito, and Phil Zielonka comprised the Crimson’s entire third line on Saturday.
Notable absences from Harvard’s line-up included junior defensemen Max Everson and Patrick McNally and goaltender Steve Michalek. Players who withdrew from Harvard mid-season will have to sit out a certain number of games at the beginning of the year in order to retain four full seasons of NCAA eligibility.
Harvard participated in a team lift immediately following their win. The Crimson will lose a day in the weight room to travel to RPI for its ECAC opener on Tuesday.
In upstate New York, Donato will look for a more complete game from his squad.
“I think [Bentley] looked like they were more game-prepared than we were,” Donato said. “It’s our first game, I guess, so that’s something to be expected, but we’re going to have to be a lot better. We’re going to have to keep improving to continue.”

On a frigid Saturday evening at Soldiers Field Soccer and Lacrosse Stadium, not even the chill could cool off Harvard freshman duo Midge Purce and Joan Fleischman.
While it was expected that Purce, who leads the Ivy League with 4.36 shots per game, would be an offensive factor, Fleischman’s performance was less predictable. The offensive outburst tripled her goal output for the season. Both forwards scored two goals as the Crimson cruised to a 4-0 win over Princeton.
“We knew what [the Tigers’] weaknesses were going in and took advantage of them,” Fleischman said. “We didn’t really change anything—we had to work hard and take advantage of the opportunities they gave us.”
Although Princeton (5-5-4, 0-4-1 Ivy) had the advantage in time of possession early on, the Crimson (9-3-2, 5-0) struck first by capitalizing on a costly Tiger defensive mistake.
Taking advantage of the Princeton defense failing to clear the ball away from the box, Fleischman took control of a loose ball and snuck it past the reach of goalie Cecilia Di Caprio to put Harvard up in the eighth minute.
Though both Harvard and the Tigers took 10 shots, none of Princeton’s forwards could find the back of the net, largely thanks to the work put in by Harvard’s goalkeepers.
The Crimson defense stayed with the opposing forwards all evening, and the goalie tandem of junior Cheta Emba and freshman Lizzie Durack combined for nine saves to preserve Harvard’s fifth shutout of the year.
“Our [defenders] are hard workers,” Purce said. “They’re solid and consistent. Never am I afraid of anything in our game—when we go down a goal, I know that we’re going to stay strong and our heads are up.”
Led by co-captain midfielder/defender Peyton Johnson, who actively harassed Princeton forwards all evening, the defense has not let the team go down often in the past 10 games, allowing just six goals over that span.
But this one was no cakewalk for the Crimson defenders.
Following the early goal, the Tiger forwards put continual pressure on the Harvard defense.
They would have knotted up the score in the 13th minute on a breakaway shot from inside the box if not for an athletic save by Emba, who came out of the box at the right moment to knock the shot away.
In an eight minute span, Princeton got off three shots on goal, but each time Emba turned them away.
Both teams turned up the physicality and defensive pressure with the break looming. Princeton was called for five of its 12 total fouls in the last 10 minutes of the half.
In the 35th minute, it seemed as if forward Purce would extend the Crimson lead after she successfully chipped a high-bouncing ball over the Princeton goalie.
But Tiger defender Diane Metcalf-Leggette sprinted into the empty goalie box and bicycle-kicked the ball out of harm’s way to keep Princeton within striking distance.
However, Harvard would not be stopped a second time and soon put the game out of reach.
After a well-placed free kick by freshman forward Karly Zlatic from just outside the box in the 43rd minute, the Tigers blocked the Crimson’s first shot out of the scuffle for the ball. But Fleischman was positioned perfectly to knock in the rebound for her second goal of the contest.
After being denied what looked to be a sure goal 10 minutes before, Purce took matters into her own hands.
Positioned for a free kick a full 48 yards from goal with five ticks left in the half, Purce launched a shot that sailed over the outstretched hands of a leaping Di Caprio to put Harvard up, 3-0.
“[The shot] was insane and it really picked us up going into halftime,” Fleischman said. “It helped us come out stronger in the second half.”
The Princeton defense turned up the pressure following the break, double and triple-teaming Purce whenever she touched the ball.
But even with the extra coverage, Purce was able to come through for her second goal, with help from her teammates in the midfield.
Taking control of the ball in the 86th minute, she dribbled past three Tiger defenders and beat the keeper with a grass-cutting shot that just slipped by, icing the 4-0 victory.
“You don’t see how much a lot of my teammates do, you usually only see the goals,” Purce said. “They fight through the entire game and so when we score a goal it’s such a team effort.”
With the squad now 9-0-2 in its current unbeaten streak, the Crimson can clinch the Ivy League title with a win over either Dartmouth or Columbia in its final two conference match-ups.
Victories over both the Big Green and the Lions in the final two weeks of the season would give Harvard its first undefeated season in conference play since 1999.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past June, Laurent Rivard took his talents back to his high school, Northfield Mount Hermon, for its alumni game. He lit up the scoreboard with an impressive display of 3 point shooting and…. Well, nothing else. No, really—his 14 threes accounted for 42 of his 44 points. Check it out here.
On a related note, Final Four hero Spike Albrecht also went to NMH, and here he plays the main point guard for Rivard, dishing out 19 assists. Yup, the same Spike Albrecht that tore up Louisville in the first half of this past year’s NCAA championship game.
The highlights of the alumni game prompted me to check out Rivard’s old days at NMH. The first thing that stands out, besides the fact that Rivard loves his long sleeve Under Armours, is that Rivard still has the same silky smooth three-point shot. The highlight reel features him not only shooting set threes, but also includes him coming off screens and hitting off balance threes, which we see far less of today (probably because they’re so much harder to make). Yet, the days of thinking that Rivard has always been a one-dimensional player are definitively over.
Another thing I noticed is Rivard’s unreal athleticism, as he was absolutely throwing it down in high school. The two most impressive to me are his posterizing dunk on #34 at 0:17 as well as his windmill alley-oop at 0:20, but the mixtape is littered with many more one-handed and two-handed dunks and alley-oops.
Rivard also clearly knew how to pass the ball. He was able to move the ball inside and get the ball to the centers and power forwards of the team so that they could finish from close range. I loved his funky two-handed pass at 1:08—it was a pretty sleek and innovative way to move the ball on the fast break, and I feel like I don’t see it often enough.
It was also good to watch Rivard drive to the hoop and finish with contact, such as at 0:22. I feel like I’ve never seen him take a shot inside of the three-point line, unless on a fast break. In fact, last year 199 of his 216 field goal attempts were from deep.
But this point brings me to my next and final point I’d like to make about the mixtape and Rivard’s game. I was extremely impressed to see his wide array of moves, such as his ball fakes (2:07) and dribbling (1:47), to get himself open for his mid-range game. Harvard probably took three mid-range shots, at most, in each of its games last year, and it’d be good to see Rivard complement his ridiculous three-point game with a nice mid-range, so that he can keep his defenders on their toes when he rises up. But then again, if you’re shooting 40% from three, why bother?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many expected a shootout. But in all likelihood, they could not have predicted the offensive showcase that took place at Harvard Stadium on Saturday.
In a game that featured nearly 1,000 total yards of offense, Princeton quarterback Quinn Epperly had the last word and led his squad to a 51-48 victory over the Crimson—its second dramatic win in the matchup in as many years.
Epperly had a career day by any measure. The junior threw for 321 yards and a program-record six touchdowns, including the game-winning score to receiver Roman Wilson in triple overtime.
“I don’t think it’s quite hit me yet,” Epperly said. “As far as just the moment, that’s probably one of the greatest moments I’ve ever been a part of on a team. It’s just paid off for how hard we’ve worked.”
The Princeton offense established a rhythm early in the game, amassing 176 yards in just the first quarter. Epperly capped off two surgical drives with touchdown passes, the second coming on a leaping, fingertips catch by tight end Des Smith.
The Tigers seemed to keep the Harvard defense on its heels all game long. Employing a lightening-fast tempo, Epperly often received the snap with 30 seconds left on the play clock. Inventive formations and shovel passes out of the backfield took their toll, as well.
But Harvard would also have its fair share of participation in the offensive display. On a fourth down early in the second quarter, junior quarterback Conner Hempel lofted a pass to senior receiver Ricky Zorn, who came down with a 33-yard touchdown reception after the ball deflected off the Princeton cornerback. Zorn would finish with a career-high 168 receiving yards.
On the Crimson’s very next drive, sophomore running back Paul Stanton broke a tackle, scurried to the sideline, and flew sixty yards down the field for the score.
Hempel threw for four touchdowns, including three to senior tight end Tyler Ott. But in the end, the team’s 48 points would not be enough for a win.
“We did some good things today, but in the first half we weren’t executing,” Harvard captain Josh Boyd said. “It was a breakdown in fundamentals. Hats off to Princeton.”
A DRAMATIC FINISH
Things did not look good for Harvard with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Down a touchdown, the Crimson offense was struggling to move the football, and Princeton looked to run down the clock and ice the game.
But senior corner Brian Owusu made all that change in an instant. As Tiger running back DiAndre Atwater took the handoff up the middle, Owusu busted through and wrenched the ball loose. Senior defensive back Jaron Wilson scooped it up and ran all the way into the Princeton red zone.
It would take Harvard just three plays to tie the score, as Hempel found Ott for a ten-yard touchdown strike. Just when it seemed the game was over, the Crimson had found life once again.
The drama continued in overtime, as each team punched in a touchdown on its first possession. Harvard converted on another Ott touchdown reception and Princeton scored on a flashy reverse to Wilson.
After the Tigers settled for a field goal in the second overtime, the Crimson looked to extend the game with one of its own. Disaster seemed imminent after a low snap, but holder Michael Pruneau was able to get the ball down just in time for junior kicker Andrew Flesher to boot it through.
But the third period of overtime would prove to be decisive. Another Harvard field goal opened the door for Princeton, and Epperly made it count by faking the run and finding Wilson in the back right corner of the end zone for the six-yard score that ended the four-hour affair.
“You watch them on film, and with their ability to run the football along with their tempo and play-action stuff, it’s very challenging to defend every zone,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “They certainly did a great job throwing the ball today and keeping it alive.”
LITTLE THINGS BECOME BIG THINGS
Plagued by penalties all game long, Harvard appeared to have trouble up front on both sides of the ball. The Crimson was flagged a total of eleven times; three of those flags came on offsides calls and four on false starts.
Those penalties hurt the most with less than a minute remaining in regulation. Hempel had just completed a 44-yard bomb to Zorn, and the Crimson seemed to be in position to steal a win with the ball on the Princeton 27.
But Harvard was called for two false starts on consecutive plays, pushing the Crimson back to the very edge of reasonable field goal range. Flesher’s 50-yard attempt, despite having the distance, flew wide left.
Along with the defeat came bad news for Harvard injury-wise. Senior center David Leopard suffered a broken ankle at the end of the third quarter and is out for the season. After Leopard’s exit, senior Nick Easton took over but had trouble delivering clean snaps.
Late in the second quarter, after returning a kickoff 44 yards, sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer was pushed out of bounds and came up hobbling. He suffered a torn hamstring on the play and, according to Murphy, is also likely done for the year.

Despite finishing the game with more penalties and fewer shots on goal, the seventh-ranked Harvard women’s ice hockey team came out on top on Saturday at Bright-Landry Hockey Center, earning its first Ivy League victory of the season with a 4-0 win over Princeton.
Sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer saw 14 more shots on goal than her Princeton counterpart Kimberly Newell, with the Tigers (1-1-0, 1-1-0 ECAC) outshooting the Crimson (2-0-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) 44-26. Maschmeyer rose to the challenge in her second game of the season, and smashed her previous career-high of 34 to make all 44 saves and preserve the shutout.
“You know, it’s an interesting thing when you have the lead and you’re getting outshot,” interim head coach Maura Crowell said. “It’s probably more demoralizing for [Princeton] than for us, so I wasn’t too focused on it.”
Maschmeyer also played a crucial role in the team’s success on the penalty kill, as Harvard players saw the penalty box seven times during the contest. Despite the constant attack and even losing her stick at one point in the game, Maschmeyer remained unrelenting in net.
“Unbelievable,” said Crowell of the goaltender’s effort. “She came up with some insane saves, she saved our behinds quite a bit out there. She was a force.”
Despite the many man-up chances, Princeton just could not get a shot past the sophomore and the rest of the Crimson defense, and was unable to convert on a single opportunity. The Tigers were also unable to drill a single shot off in the final four minutes of the game.
“We put a lot of pressure on them and we battled hard on the boards,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “We’re a fast team so I think we capitalized on their mistakes, and then when we made mistakes, we made sure to get back and really aggressively make up for it.”
A large part of Harvard’s success came from its ability to do what Princeton could not, as three of Harvard’s goals came on the power play. The first strike came about halfway through the first period off a goal from junior Sami Reber. The forward converted on the team’s first power play of the game, slamming the puck in from the upper right corner off an assist from Crowe to take a 1-0 lead.
“I feel like we got off to a slow start, but I think we picked it up as the game went on,” Crowe said. “Getting that first goal gave us momentum that carried us throughout the whole game.”
Crowe did more than her part to keep the momentum going, as the junior matched her career-high and scored two goals off assists from freshman Briana Mastel and sophomore Miye D’Oench. It was a familiar storyline for Princeton, as the last time Crowe had two goals was in a 10-1 pounding of Princeton her freshman year.
After scoring her first goal in the second period to put Harvard up 3-0, Crowe drilled the puck from above the crease just past Newell’s right side into the goal. With only 6:08 left in the third period, it was the last time anyone would find the back of the net, and Harvard clinched the 4-0 win.
“Both were great passes. I was in the right spot at the right time,” Crowe said. “The first one, [Mastel] saw me and had a great pass. And then Miye just laid it in nicely and I had my stick on the ice.”
Junior Sarah Edney scored Harvard’s fourth goal, bouncing the puck off the right post and ricocheting it past Newell from the upper right corner late in the first period. The goal, coming with less than two minutes left in the period, sent the Crimson into the first intermission with a 2-0 lead in a game that was fast-paced from start to finish.
“It was definitely an exciting game with a lot of up and down [on the ice], almost a track-meet sort of style of game,” Crowell said. “But I’m happy with a lot of the things that came out of it, and obviously a 4-0 win against a very tough team is great.”
With victories over both Quinnipiac and Princeton this weekend, Harvard completed an undefeated start to its 2013-2014 season. While the team acknowledges that there’s still some work to be done as the season continues, a win is a win--and a win over Princeton is even better.
“We take pride in winning Ivy League games,” Crowe said. “We take pride in winning any game. But certainly it’s fun to beat Princeton...they’ve always been a rivalry of ours.”

It’s crucial to go into parents’ weekend with a strategy. With the arrival of family on campus comes the potential for both very good and very bad things to happen. When planning for parents’ weekend, one must strategize about how to best depict college life and how to most effectively get what you want. Here are a few of Flyby’s key tips:
 
Start using the word “homesick” in the days prior to their visit.It’s important to have your parents’ sympathies on your side even before they get into town. They need to come in with the right attitude. Drop some hints about specific things you might be happy to see them arrive with in Boston. I’ve personally been missing my favorite frozen yogurt from home. In a few days, I will strategically mention this to my mother. “Ugh—I miss home and all the small comforts of Palo Alto so much. Sometimes, I think I would feel so much better if only I could have some natural and chocolate swirled Fraiche with raspberries and Mochi… Oh—by the way—did I ever tell you about the time my friend Hannah’s grandmother transported black sesame ice cream from China using dry ice?” Yes, I do know someone who brought ice cream across the world, so it is possible to bring froyo from California. Hopefully my parents can figure it out.
Take advantage of your parents’ company—and by that, I mean their wallets.Aim for a noticeable weight loss or gain just in time for parents weekend—and blame it on the food. “Dad, Annenberg is so awful—I never eat. I basically just live off water and the edamame they occasionally have in the salad bar.” Or: “Mom, help! Every meal I eat pizza, fries, cookies, and frozen yogurt. I know you warned me about the freshman 15, but there really are no other options. None of my clothes even fit any more.” Take your parents to the dining hall so they can check it out themselves—they won’t be impressed. Request nice meals out while they’re here and obtain gift cards to your favorite spots so you can continue to eat well when they’re gone.
 
While you’re at lunch at your favorite fancy restaurant, casually complain about back pain. Is it due to the beds? Do you have a severe illness contracted in high-density, germ-ridden dorms? Whatever the cause, the solution to this is easy: a massage. Oh, and you’ve been working so hard that your anxiety levels are high. A trip to the spa will cure a debilitating physical ailment and boost your mental well-being, killing two birds with one stone.
 
One last note on this: don’t forget to milk the frigid New England climate for all it’s worth. Thankfully, it will be pretty chilly by the time parents’ weekend rolls around. Greet your parents in completely weather inappropriate clothing. Go for shock value. “What are you wearing?! You cannot wear that in this weather—you’re going to die.” “Mom, I don’t own anything besides tank tops and shorts. I do have a cotton sweater though that I wear at night.” This tactic will work especially well if you’re from another, warmer part of the world. “You think I’ll need a parka, Dad?” Oh, and if you’ve achieved significant weight loss/gain, also use this as an excuse. Soon enough, you’ll find yourself on a shopping spree for “winter clothing.”
Party with your parents.Let’s be honest, everyone wants to relive their youth. Don’t think your parents are the exception. You can bet that they’re jealous when they stalk your Facebook pics—they too want to be dancing on tables, posing with red cups, throwing back shots, and shotgunning beers (Because that’s what most Harvard students do, right?). Even if that’s not normally included in your weekend plans, use Parents’ Weekend to let loose. Drunk bonding with your parents might be a good way to break the ice, and you can get them to promise to buy you more nice things in this state. Plus, they won’t even notice the mess in your room and will forget about your failed midterm that you briefly mentioned in conversation.
 
Sidenote: Your parents will be jealous if they miss out on the fun. So try not to go too crazy the night before they arrive. This will most likely not be a good start to the weekend.
 
Good luck!

Whether or not reservations are required varies by school—below is a breakdown of universities and their various policies regarding this topic. In general, it is important to look at the websites of universities you’d like to visit before you set foot on campus. Make sure that tours and information sessions are indeed being offered on the day that you are planning to be there—some colleges do not offer them every day of the week, and holidays might mean tours and information sessions are suspended.
HARVARD No prior registration is required for small groups. For engineering tours, groups of 10 or more must email tours@fas.harvard.edu.
YALE No prior registration is required, although there is an online tool that lets you inform Yale ahead of time that you are planning on coming so that they can make prior arrangements. Yale also asks that groups of 10 or more make a reservation via a request form on Yale’s website.
PRINCETON Does not require reservations for its student-run tours except for groups of 15 or more.
COLUMBIA requires prior registration for both tours and information sessions.
DARTMOUTH Dartmouth prefers visitors to sign up ahead of time through a tool on their website. Groups of 10 or more should call (603) 646-2875 a month before their visit. Groups of this size can only be accommodated when classes are in session. Dartmouth also does not offer tours to large groups during the month of April.
CORNELL For campus tours, only groups of 10 or more need to make reservations. Students interested in attending information sessions should RSVP on Cornell’s website. Groups of 10 or more should also alert the admissions office two weeks prior to their arrival if they wish to attend an information session.
BROWN Reservations are not required, but they are recommended for campus tours.
PENN As tours and information sessions have limited capacity, it is necessary to register ahead of time on the website.
MIT Reservations for information sessions are highly recommended. For groups of 10 or more, a special form available on MIT’s website should be completed and submitted two weeks prior to arrival.
CALTECH Caltech offers special group tours for groups of 10 high schoolers or more. These tours require filling out a request form. Prospective students should also pre-register for information sessions and campus tours.
AMHERST No reservations are required for groups of fewer than 10. Groups of 10 or more should call (413) 542-2328 two weeks prior to their visit.
