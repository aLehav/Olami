After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ye has once again taken to social media to share his opinions, this time regarding Pete Davidson’s relationship with Kim Kardashian.
Around 1:00 a.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 13, Ye posted the first of his memes: an edit of “Captain America: Civil War” which depicted himself as Captain America and Pete Davidson as Iron Man. According to the meme, Ye’s allies are Drake, Julia Fox, Travis Scott, and Future. Conversely, Pete’s team consists of Kim Kardashian, Kid Cudi, and Taylor Swift. And after fans online assumed (incorrectly) that Billie’s recent comments about a fan’s safety at her concert were a dig at Travis Scott, Billie Eilish too became one of Ye’s enemies.
He captioned the post: “THE INTERNET HAS STILL NOT FOUND A DECENT PICTURE OF SKETE,” referring to Pete Davidson. Soon after, Ye posted another meme, this time an edit of Venom and Carnage engaged in a “fight night.”
The Instagram onslaught took a more personal turn on Valentine’s Day, when Ye leaked screenshots of his personal messages with Kardashian. In a text chain with “Kim Other Phone,” Kardashian said “U are creating a dangerous and scary environment and someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault.” In all caps, his caption read, “UPON MY WIFE’S REQUEST PLEASE NOBODY DO ANYTHING PHYSICAL TO SKETE I'M GOING TO HANDLE THE SITUATION MYSELF.” Fans and critics alike quickly called out Ye’s behavior and condemned the sharing of private information.
Last Tuesday, Ye deleted his previous posts and uploaded what appeared to be an apology. The post included the caption, “I know sharing screenshots was jarring and came off as harassing Kardashian. I take accountability. I’m still learning in real time. I don’t have all the answers. To be a good leader is a good listener.” Unlike his previous posts, the caption appeared in lowercase instead of in all capital letters. Some might claim this is an indication that an external PR team got involved, or that he did not write the caption at all. Regardless, the post’s emphasis on growth and accountability demonstrates at the least an acknowledgement of his actions.
This is not the first time Ye has released a rapid series of posts on social media followed by a mass deletion. Notoriously, on January 27, 2016, Ye tweeted around 30 times in an hour due to a supposed altercation with Wiz Khalifa. This rant came about two weeks prior to the Valentine’s Day release of his seventh studio album “The Life of Pablo.” Many believed this to be a publicity stunt to raise awareness for the album.
With Ye’s next album, “Donda 2,” awaiting release on Feb. 22, some believe that this is once again an album publicity stunt; As the saying goes, all publicity is good publicity. While magazines cover his behavior and his posts are shared and retweeted, the name Ye is inserted into people’s minds and continuously appears in their feed. Come Feb. 22, even those unfamiliar with his discography will recognize his name.
But what if it’s not a stunt?
The media is no stranger to sensationalizing the mental state of celebrities for mass consumption. Take, for example, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, and Britney Spears. In this era of mass consumption defined by movies, television, fast food, and two-day shipping, celebrities bear the unfortunate burden of being treated as commodities for an eager public.
Still, in the same way athletes are told to “shut up and play ball,” musicians are basically told to “shut up and sing.” For many, their worth is determined by their level of entertainment. For musicians struggling with issues of mental health, like Ye, this tokenization is not only draining but also dehumanizing.
Ye famously opened up about his journey with bipolar disorder in his 2018 album “Ye.” The cover art of the album reads, “I hate being Bi-Polar it’s awesome.” Lyrics in this album include “I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed” and “I think about killing myself.” He cites his disorder as the reason for his notorious outbursts, including his 2018 TMZ interview in which he claimed “slavery was a choice.”
It is evident he is struggling at the moment and needs to be helped rather than laughed at. This is not to say leaking Kardashian’s private information and threatening Davidson was justified — it was not. But it is also unfair to tokenize Ye’s pain for clicks or enjoyment.
Furthermore, as the wealthiest Black artist in the country, his tokenization takes on an ever more complex role. The United States has historically commodified Black bodies as sources of entertainment. In the nineteenth century, vaudeville and minstrel shows — in which white actors donned blackface and reinforced racial stereotypes — were the most popular forms of popular entertainment. Early animation in the twentieth century, including “Tom and Jerry” and “Looney Tunes" also depicted racist caricatures of Black people for a laugh.
In recent decades, the media has taken the struggles of Black celebrities and appropriated them for sensationalism. Notably, Whitney Houston’s alleged drug addiction flooded the tabloids and led to barrages of rumors, leading to her famous 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer in which she stated, “I make too much money to smoke crack.” Last year, tennis player Naomi Osaka received international media backlash and a $15,000 fine for refusing press conferences at the French Open, a decision she claimed was for her mental health.
When Black celebrities struggle, their pain is too often plastered on the front page. Ye is the latest example. Rather than sensationalize and aggravate his manic episodes, it is necessary to treat him as a human being first — not least because he has children who will grow up to read exactly how their father is portrayed in the media. He has much to apologize for and many people to make amends, but he owes the media nothing. Yes, he is arrogant, abrasive, and constantly makes bad decisions — all of which could easily be avoided with a proper PR team — but his mental health struggles warrant an empathy the public often denies him.

Back in Nov. 2021, Big Thief lead singer Adrianne Lenker toured her solo double album “song” and “instrumentals,” an intimate and vocals-centered endeavor. As part of the setlist, she also performed an unreleased song she named “Spud Infinity.” Jangly and almost childlike, “Spud Infinity” sounded like an odd choice to include, yet it also perfectly displayed Lenker’s peculiar and unpredictable songwriting. Several months later, “Spud Infinity” was released as a single for Big Thief’s new record, “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You,” hinting at the record’s unbounded and unwieldy personality.
On Big Thief’s latest offering, four seems to be the magic number. Recorded in four different regions of the United States, with four different producers, and four different artistic endeavors in mind, “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You” sonically encapsulates the band’s recording journey. It is at once sprawling, dynamic, multifaceted, and a natural extension of 2019’s “U.F.O.F.” and “Two Hands.” Although, at one hour and 20 minutes, it is Big Thief’s longest record to date, it is never a drag or redundant. “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You” benefits from the ambitious amount of genres, textures, and sound Big Thief stuffs into the record. It is at times cerebral, drawing elements from “U.F.O.F.,” and at times earthy, echoing the grounded rock of “Two Hands.” Spanning many different genres, sounds, and energies, the album proves that Big Thief continues to reach new heights.
Opening the album with the soft folk tune “Change,” Big Thief eases into the album with a track focused on Lenker’s voice, imitating the intimate environment of past records “Masterpiece” and “Capacity.” Over softly-strummed guitar, Lenker laments, “Change like the wind / like the water / like skin.” Speaking on the inevitability of change, the passage of time, as well as the fleeting nature of human relationships, the track’s lyrics juxtapose with the seemingly familiar territory the song musically treks. Sweet and minimally produced, the track’s central themes hint at the journey that the rest of the album takes.
Next, Big Thief throws the curveball that is “Spud Infinity.” Silly, gleeful and the closest Big Thief has approached to southern folk music, the track’s instrumentals are as off-brand as its lyrics. Featuring an infectious fiddle, the mischievous boring of a jaw harp, and a shoe-stomping melody, you would almost think that Big Thief had pulled out a banjo and changed into flannels and ripped jean shorts. Its lyrics, in the same vein, are warm, goofy, and humorous all at the same time. Cleverly, Lenker giddily sings “When I say celestial / I mean extraterrestrial / I mean accepting the alien you’ve rejected in your own heart.”
Although Lenker speaks on many different things, ranging from birds to Adam and Eve to potatoes, she still returns to the idea that she draws the most from: love. In the album’s title track, Big Thief mirrors the alien landscape that inspired “U.F.O.F.” Backed by a sparkling and magical guitar line, the band seems to float throughout the track, especially when iridescent ambient sounds illuminate the background of the guitar strumming. Fittingly, throughout much of the song, Lenker sings lyrics that are enigmatic and inscrutable. Clarity hits, however, when she professes “Take me to the limits of your love.” As the sounds swell around Lenker’s rising voice, the song takes flight.
Similarly, Lenker expresses these ideas of love in “Little Things,” a shoegaze-esque highlight from the record. Swirling, distorted and noisy guitar drives the song as Lenker traces every detail of her love for its subject. Cutting through the thick instrumentals, she expresses “The little things I like about you … New York is a crowded place / I still lose sight of every other face.” Near the end of the track, Lenker lets out a throaty yelp, electrifying the song with her own display of passion.
Speaking in an interview with Vulture, Lenker said of the recording process, “We weren’t thinking of trying to match the sounds or trying to make continuity at all… We constructed what felt more like a playlist rather than everything being one vibe.” This sentiment is felt throughout the record, with many different genres never before explored by Big Thief being showcased on “Dragon.” The hip-hop inflected rhythm of “Blurred View” and the electronic textures of “Heavy Bend” stand as clear examples. Big Thief even flexes more shoegaze on the ethereal “Flower of Blood,” and returns to Appalachian folk on “Red Moon.”
A folky, earthy track, “Blue Lightning,” concludes the album. Dedicated to their relationship as a band, Lenker speaks for everyone: “I wanna be the shoelace that you tie / ’Til the end, will you be my friend?” As the track concludes, one of the male band members can be heard saying in the background, “Gorgeous set, okay, what should we do now?” This imperfection in production at the end of the record conveys the very essence of their journey recording “Dragon.” Big Thief is capable of going anywhere. And “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You” tracks their wondrous trajectory into interesting, unknown territory.

Holographic riding cloaks and “High School Musical” parody songs seem to have no place at a rock concert. Any CHAI show readily dispels this assumption. Entering the stage with a playful pomp of neon hair-ties and tulle, the band began its Boston performance at The Sinclair behind a veil of smoke. As three of the band members stood with their cloaked backs to the crowd, Yuna – the band’s drummer – took her place and began to play the band's electric opener “No More Cake.”
Subtle head bopping gave way to full-on infectious choreography as Mana (the band’s primary vocalist), Kana (guitar), and Yuuki (bass) turned to face an energized crowd to spit the song’s first verses into their mics. The four musicians invited fans to move with them and held them in that space for the next hour. CHAI demonstrated their abilities as masterful entertainers, their neo-kawaii aesthetic fostering a delightfully electric atmosphere at the Cambridge mainstay.
Although CHAI – who hail from Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture in Japan – have been together since 2012, the WINK TOGETHER North American Tour marks the group’s first Boston area performance. For their first time in Cambridge, the band primarily stuck to music from their most recent third studio album, “WINK,” which was released in May of 2021. The music encapsulated the blend of alternative J-pop and rock moods that the band has spent so long cultivating, as well as their signature aesthetic, neo-kawaii.
“Neo-kawaii means that all girls are pretty from the moment they were born, and that there is not a single girl who is not KAWAII,” write the band on their official website. “There should be many more types of KAWAII, and everyone is KAWAII in her own way. COMPLEX IS ART.”
This ethos is baked into CHAI’s live performance, their tight choreography and multi-colored lights reaching out into the audience and making the stage feel much bigger than it appears.
The musical arrangements themselves energized and highlighted the subtleties of CHAI’s most beloved tracks, making the performance a more memorable and intimate experience. At the tail end of “No More Cake,” CHAI extended the song, allowing for Kana to come to the edge of the stage for an awesome guitar solo. Yuna’s drum fills in other extended versions of songs like “PING PONG” would get the crowd hollering. While they are decidedly a rock band, CHAI did not let the label define their instrumentality. Yuna and Mana utilized 808s and synthesizers to their full effect, composing on-the-spot electronic interludes between songs.
Holding true to their self-defined style, each member explained what each of them found wonderful about themselves and their days during the band’s trademark pop-song-contrafactum introduction. As the crowd in The Sinclair sang the chorus of “We’re All in This Together, ” Mana, Kana, Yuuki, and Yuna introduced themselves one-by-one in a campfire-esque fashion.
Ending with their popular beachy, laid back tune “Donuts Mind If I Do,” CHAI took The Sinclair through a variety of soundscapes with impressive visuals to match. While there unfortunately wasn’t much chit-chat from the band between songs (besides Yuna at one point attesting to the deliciousness of New England Clam Chowder), some of their slower tracks like “Miracle” or their cover of Mariya Takeuchi’s “Plastic Love” became a way to communicate more deeply with the crowd.
CHAI brings an overall incredible stage presence that will have both hardcore fans and newcomers dancing and singing along with every song.

Nearly two years after postponing his debut solo tour, Louis Tomlinson performed to a sold out crowd on Feb. 17 at Boston’s House of Blues as part of his long-awaited “Louis Tomlinson World Tour.” After such a long wait it was no surprise that the Brit’s fervent fans began lining up as early as 7:30 A.M. to secure highly coveted barricade spots for the show. Taking the stage with nothing more than a mic stand, a backing band, and a giant smiley face behind him, Tomlinson let the music take over. Through a balanced mix of the new and the nostalgic, his performance proved that the once-boyband star can excel all on his own.
Fans in the audience were quickly rewarded for their time when Tomlinson displayed his experience and expertise as a performer by interacting with the crowd. In turn, the crowd supported Tomlinson’s hometown with Doncaster Rovers Football Kits dotting the audience, along with nearly a dozen Louis Tomlinson dolls. As an added surprise for the singer, fans also came together to take part in a nightly fan project — giving out an abundance of pride flags to hold up during the concert. Throughout the performance, Tomlinson displayed a unique ability to make a large crowd feel small — reading signs, flipping off audience members (something that has become a sign of endearment among Tomlinson’s fans), and even filming himself on a fan’s phone that had been thrown on stage.
The singer’s expert stage presence was supported by strong vocals throughout. He maneuvered the crowd through rousing lyrics from his debut solo album, 2020’s “Walls.” After opening with the mid-tempo rock ballad “We Made It” and a One Direction cover, Tomlinson performed a stretch of songs from the album including “Two of Us” and “Too Young.” While Tomlinson’s discography can at times feel formulaic, his music transcends in a live setting. Songs like “Don’t Let It Break Your Heart” and “Always You” that come across as generic on recording were invigorated with new energy during the concert as Tomlinson bounced off the crowd's high energy. A casual concert goer would never guess that Tomlinson's “Copy of A Copy of A Copy” was an unreleased track as his devoted fans sang along without missing a single word.
“I know you know the words to this one,” Tomlinson remarked before launching into a crowd-pleasing rendition of One Direction’s 2015 hit “Drag Me Down.” The cover marked the first of three One Direction songs the former band member would sing. Tomlinson also took time to pay tribute to two of his musical influences, including a cover of Kings of Leon’s 2013 single “Beautiful War.” The surprise highlight of the night came during Tomlinson’s cover of Catfish and the Bottlemen’s indie rock track “7.” The song’s stripped back choruses allowed Tomlinson’s vocals to shine, building up to a bombastic final chorus featuring a belt unlike anything from his own discography.
Tomlinson’s encore turned out to be carefully crafted to highlight the best parts of this performance. The three-song stretch began with “Only the Brave,'' a stripped back number that stands out from Tomlinson’s collection of otherwise forgettable slow songs. After a quick final thank you speech for his crew and supporting act (the punk rock band Sun Room), Tomlinson reached for yet another crowd pleaser with a solo rendition of One Direction’s “Through the Dark” that had the entire audience captivated.
Tomlinson closed out the 90-minute set with his debut album’s second single “Kill My Mind.” On its own, “Kill My Mind” is a Tomlinson performance at its very best. Paying homage to mid ’90s Britpop, the track’s anthemic chorus shook the venue, threatening to overwhelm the House of Blues as if meant for the biggest stage and the loudest crowd. This track reached new heights as his concert finale, leaving the audience with one final taste of his stage presence. Old and new fans alike left with a new perspective on Tomlinson as an artist — the greatest accomplishment for a debut solo tour. With performances like these in his future, Tomlison has the makings of a successful solo career.

Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift have released another song together, raising their total number of collaborations to four. “The Joker and the Queen” came out this week as a remix of one of Sheeran’s own songs from his 2021 album “Equals.” It is not the best song that the pair have released, but it is easy to connect with and flaunts the pair’s songwriting chemistry.
The track shares two perspectives of the same romance, both of which don’t seem to believe that the other person could fall for them. Sheeran sings, “I know you could fall for a thousand kings,” indicating some insecurity, and Swift responds “I know you think that what makes a king is gold, a palace, and diamond rings.” The language describing a game of cards throughout does a nice job of demonstrating the guardedness the two had at the beginning of their relationship and then the choice to go “all in” together. It’s no surprise that Sheeran and Swift do an excellent job of making the relatively simple melody and composition shine with their clever wordplay.
The song falls into a more unique category of music for Sheeran and Swift. Now that both have been in committed and happy relationships for some time, the two have branched out into writing music that doesn’t stem from personal heartbreak. It might have seemed like a risky step, as both are known to produce hard-hitting and emotional music about their own personal lives, but they have managed to carry their talents over to imagined storylines that deliver just as much of an emotional relatability as the music they’ve written about themselves.
The music video, released when the song came out, gives new meaning and ascribes details to the story that the song doesn’t provide. The video for “The Joker and the Queen” doesn’t feature Sheeran or Swift at all, instead starring two lookalikes who were first cast as childhood best friends in the 2013 “Everything Has Changed” music video from Swift’s “Red” album. Almost 10 years after their first video together, the leads in “The Joker and the Queen” portray young people moving away from home for the first time they hold picture frames of each other from the first music video. Deeply personal, the video invites viewers to consider that the song might also be applied to a friendship as well as a romantic relationship.
The music video certainly emphasizes what might now be considered a canon of easter eggs shared between the two, featuring a real text conversation that once went viral between Sheeran and Swift and various nods to the pair’s friendship, including a scene where the female lead draws Swift’s favorite number, 13, over and over in a notebook.
The collaboration fits in nicely with the other three songs Sheeran and Swift have done together, “Everything Has Changed,” “End Game” (with Future; yes, it’s as chaotic as it sounds), and “Run.” Above all, this latest track the simple construction and excellent songwriting that Sheeran and Swift do best.

Over the course of more than three years making music, three EPs, and a critically acclaimed debut album (2021’s “Juno”), alternative funk-pop artist Remi Wolf has more than established herself as the quintessential Gen Z pop star: effervescent, unapologetic, devoid of the compulsion to stick with tired genre conventions, and effortlessly cool. Indeed, much of Wolf’s music is defined largely by its willingness to break down the walls of genre, leaning instead into innovative blends and stylistic collages that keep her at the cutting edge. (It’s no wonder she has a viral TikTok hit under her belt.) On Feb. 13, Wolf stopped at the Royale in Boston for one of the last shows of her sold-out nationwide headlining tour with supporting act Grace Ives.
“My name is Remi Wolf, and we are in Boston,” she said upon walking onto a stage decorated with a hand-painted couch and colorful rug, both of which glowed neon under the venue’s fluorescent lighting. With that, the California native began what would become a nearly two hour set, captivating from start to finish. From the moment she stepped on stage, Wolf’s stage presence was unmistakable — a fact she ensured no one would forget as she gave eager audiences an expansive tour of her growing discography. Outfitted in Pepto Bismol-pink Uggs, sweatpants, an oversized t-shirt emblazoned with the words “Horny Toads,” and a rotating cast of headwear, Wolf belted her way through hit after hit, her voice soaring over funky bass and shimmering guitar riffs.
Wolf’s power-packed set began with a particularly energetic rendition of “Liquor Store,” the first single off of “Juno.” “Liquor store, 'cause I want morе, carnivore / Eating my heart out, liquor store,” she sang while dancing around the stage, sure to give attention to every inch of the crowded club venue. The song, a candid track written about Wolf’s self-prescribed “fear of abandonment and dependency on people and alcohol,” proved a catalyzing start to the show. Throughout the Royale, an eager audience decked in glittery makeup and trendy hairstyles itched to sing along to the song’s iconic bridge: “Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? / You, motherfucker, you, you, motherfucker.” Other fan favorites like the intoxicatingly catchy “Monte Carlo,” “Shawty,” and “Woo!” provided similar opportunities for Wolf’s audience to get in on the fun, screaming the lyrics into Wolf’s held-out microphone.
In an already strong set, “Liz,” also from “Juno,” proved a sure stand-out early on. Wolf started the song from the couch, lounging with a drink in hand before standing up and diving into the song’s heart wrenching chorus, among the more explicitly vulnerable and lovelorn in the singer’s repertoire. Mic stand clenched in hand, Wolf gave her all to the song. Her signature raspy voice pushed against the smooth instrumentation of the track almost to the point of breaking, but it never lost its strength. The fact that she was able to keep up the caliber of her voice throughout the show — amid a seemingly endless stream of incredibly vocally-demanding songs — was itself an unmistakable feat.
With her commanding presence, Remi Wolf appeared nothing if not comfortable on stage. Ever the entertainer, she led fans through breathing exercises, spontaneous introductions, alternative song endings, covers of early 2000s hits “Crazy” (by Gnarls Barkley) and MGMT’s “Electric Feel,” as well as improvised stage antics. At one point, she replaced drummer Conor Malloy on the drum kit while he, iPhone in hand, read out “positive affirmations” from his Notes app. “I am in the right place doing the right thing…. I know how to do my taxes,” he chanted, and the crowd repeated each affirmation back to him in unison. Brought to life by the band’s chemistry (Wolf and guitarist Jack DeMeo rolled around on the floor on more than one occasion) as much as by Wolf’s own performance chops, the show was a vitalizing family affair.
Wolf proved she had the range, too. From the soft and breaking ballad “Street You Live On” to the manic firecracker that is “Quiet on Set,” she stunned and never missed a beat. By the time Wolf and her band left the stage after their main set, the pop artist had taken her audience to the farthest reaches of her irresistibly technicolor discography and back. Banger after banger, Wolf cemented herself further as alt-pop royalty. “Disco Man,” one of Wolf’s most popular songs and the last encore of the night, was no different. Marked by a grooving, R&B-inspired bassline, the song is effortlessly danceable and was the perfect note to end the show. “Said that he’s a disco man…. And I told him he could kiss my hand / If ya meet me at the disco, disco,” she sang, stretching out her hand and dancing around the stage with impossible energy. Exemplified in “Disco Man” as in every other song, her impressive vocals and contagious energy sustained the show throughout — a refreshing performance from an artist sure to only grow in popularity.
Wolf closed out the show like she opened it: “My name’s Remi Wolf. Thank you for coming. I love you very much. I’ll see you next time.” With a months-long U.S. tour with Lorde on the horizon, fans can rest assured next time will be very soon.

Harvard’s Accessible Education Office is among the most important institutions on campus. Ensuring that disability poses no barrier to getting a Harvard education is one of our highest duties as a community. Unfortunately, funding that effort is not a very flashy business; no buildings to name, ribbons to cut, professorships to endow. The AEO is chronically underfunded. Harvard can change that.
We appreciate the heroic effort of individual AEO officers while acknowledging the difficulty of getting a hold of them. Students often feel that long wait times compound the difficulties the AEO is trying to resolve in the first place. Succeeding at Harvard is a difficult feat on its own. A disability, even properly accommodated, makes it that much harder. The University adds a third layer of difficulty by under-resourcing the office with the power to alleviate the first two.
A well-resourced office is particularly important when the process of accommodating disability requires so much documentation. We recognize the unfortunate necessity of some of that bureaucracy — the details of disability are important in crafting appropriate accommodations, and some degree of verification is necessary. But this is an argument for more funding, not less.
We call on Harvard to provide that funding. For the richest university in the world, accessibility should be viewed as a basic essential, not a contingent luxury. Fortunately, there is a clear path for securing that funding even if Harvard remains unwilling to shell out.
Court donors. CAMHS’s new 24/7 hotline, funded by the donation of a Harvard parent, provides a model for how to fund the efforts necessary to support our most vulnerable classmates. So long as we are dependent on the whims of donors, we should make donating to the AEO as appealing as endowing a professorship. Maybe that means putting naming rights in play, flattering donors with the attention of top administrators, marking donations with high-publicity events.
We can think of few better uses of our administrators’ time and our institution’s brand. Surely great leadership lies in part in keeping the most vulnerable in our community eminently in mind. And while they’re at it, the administration should increase transparency on how frequently the AEO is used. We suspect that if they did, the absurdity of giving the AEO six employees to jointly serve Harvard’s graduate and undergraduate population.
We watch as Harvard expands its campus, renovates buildings, and increases its endowment each year, while students’ most pressing needs for mental health support and disability accomodation go underfunded. This is a natural consequence of the donor-dependent system which will prevail at Harvard for the foreseeable future. It is not, however, an inevitable consequence of that system. More than almost any other institution in the world, Harvard has bargaining power with its donors. We have an incredibly powerful brand. When we lay out our priorities, when we actively pursue them, when we make tradeoffs to support them, we will get results.
All that remains is to choose those priorities. Surely one must be an Accessible Education Office that’s actually accessible.

Every time a Harvard preceptor, adviser, or administrator describes me as “Latinx,” or uses the term in my presence, I get a distinct feeling that somewhere, off in the distance, four Spanish voters each register with the GOP in Arizona, Texas, Nevada, and Florida, respectively.
Congressman Ruben Gallego, a Hispanic Midwesterner-turned-Harvard-graduate who currently represents Arizona’s capital in the House of Representatives, spoke out in 2020 against “the word” in the wake of his party’s down-ballot shellacking that year. One midterm election cycle later, and I’m inclined to believe that his words fell on deaf ears among Democratic leadership. I’ve been stunned to see “Latinx” continuously re-appear in official party campaign language to this day; in fact, one of these instances occurred earlier this month on social media. (In that case, the Democrats used “the word” in an infographic that broke down successful judicial confirmations into racial groups.)
I have no novel arguments of my own to make about the problems that arise from the “Latinx” neologism in this column - and besides, the matter has already been litigated many times in the past by national commentators across the ideological spectrum. (Some particularly recent examples include a writer at The Atlantic, the editor-in-chief of the National Review, pundits at POLITICO, and a columnist at The Washington Post.)
What I will argue today, however, is that the Spanish language is far from the only thing being rewritten in modern-day 2022 Hispanic America. For the first time in the history of modern polling, Latino voters are expected to cast their ballots roughly equally between the Democrats and the Republicans this year in a clear shattering of the so-called “demographics as destiny” theory. The rightward shift of Hispanic Americans in post-2020 is an electoral development that The New York Times belatedly identified as a “political earthquake” only two months ago (although writers affiliated with the neighboring Wall Street Journal have eagerly characterized the Hispanic-GOP union as a “natural” pairing for a while now).
Such a pari passu manifested in the voting intentions of Latinos this year has immediate implications for short-term control of both Houses of Congress — indeed, the nation's eyes have already turned to states like Arizona, Nevada, and Florida (all of which enjoy particularly high Hispanic American populations) as we head into the November midterm election. The defeat of an incumbent senator in any of these three states this year — Democratic or Republican — would almost assuredly upset the upper chamber’s current 50-50 delicate balance.
My home state of Indiana is not exactly well-known for its Hispanic culture and community relative to the aforementioned Sun Belt states; neither, of course, is the American heartland relative to other regions of the country. Still, Hispanic Midwesterners do, in fact, exist. And as one of these Hispanic Midwesterners in question, I vehemently believe that — perhaps to the chagrin of Carvillian “demographics as destiny” supporters — the post-2020 Hispanic “swing voter” tendencies currently observed in the Sun Belt and in the South will soon come to the Midwest as well.
I’m sure that political scientists nationwide harboring similarly-minded theories are gathering empirical evidence in support of that proposition as we speak. My own rudimentary reasoning, though, emerges from the Hispanic cultural values — family and hard work especially — that I am intimately familiar with. Gut feeling is admittedly another important motivator as well; call it a Hoosier hypothesis, if you will.
Speaking of conjecture, it’s also worth noting that it’s anyone’s guess as to which party is favored to either hold or re-take either national legislative chamber come Election Day. The only thing I can say on that front with confidence is the following: members of the Hispanic community nationwide are clearly paying closer attention to what candidates for office on both sides of the aisle — not just one — have to offer as policy solutions. Are those candidates — and perhaps more critically, their respective political parties — returning that attention in kind as they try to get their respective messages across to potential voters and win over the Hispanic American electorate? Only time will tell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
I was disappointed to see The Crimson’s coverage of the Undergraduate Council general meeting that took place on Tuesday the 22nd. The article “UC Meeting Stalls Due to Lack of Attendance” blames the slow progress of the meeting on a lack of quorum, but any that paid attention to the meeting would have seen that in fact, fewer than 30 minutes were spent on legislation in the entire meeting, with the rest of the time being used for presentations and questions about the Citizens’ Assembly and Shopping Week. The council never lost quorum while considering legislation and was certainly never delayed by it. In fact, the council was relatively efficient when the time did come to vote, with three bills being considered, voted on, and passed – one even being amended – in just under half an hour. The article also reports that “only 29 representatives attended the meeting,” but a review of the attendance report will show that 34 members were present for at least part of the meeting. The student body is always best served when The Crimson provides an accurate and fair account of the UC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


For most Black people, February 27th is fairly insignificant, simply marking the second-to-last day of Black History Month. For me, it wholly defines my experience with Blackness. In a way, it is fitting (although purely coincidental) that Dominican Independence Day is celebrated as Black History Month comes to a close, as for most of my life, I felt that I existed on the fringes of Blackness. The tensions between my Dominican-Hispanic and Black identities prevented me from feeling secure in my Blackness, even as my skin complexion made it unequivocally clear to everyone around me.
My Spanish-speaking household did not seem to fall in line with the stories we learned in school about Black History Month, so I naturally felt that February was intended to commemorate a history that I could not claim as my own. Despite Latin America being home to the largest Black population outside of Africa, this side of history was completely excluded from my curriculum. No evidence around me proved that being Black and Hispanic could coexist, and thus, I was forced to choose. As a child, I subconsciously chose the latter. I chose to detach myself from the Black identity not because I did not like my physical features, but because I had internalized a singular form of Blackness that I was unable to perfectly fit. I have always been called “morena” and “prieta” — both terms referencing my dark skin — by fellow Dominicans. I never questioned or objected to these names, but somehow I did not equate them with Blackness. I was confined in the interstitial state of knowing I was Black but being unable to use the term to describe my identity. For years, I clung to Latina, Hispanic, or simply Dominican.
I was forced to contend with my dormant identity crisis in high school when I began attending a predominantly white institution for the first time. At a school where few faces resembled mine, it was impossible for me to push my Blackness aside when “Black” encompassed the extent of what I was deemed by others. The conflicting identities that I had suppressed until then were unexpectedly brought to the forefront, and I realized that in a country where race inevitably governs how we navigate the spaces we inhabit, refraining from acknowledging my Blackness was not an option. History and society dictated the choice that I previously believed I had the freedom to make within the comfort of my sheltered childhood. More disconcerting, however, was the realization that I was doing myself the same disservice as those around me — stripping my identity of the nuance it possesses. Finding myself unable to place “Black” and “Latina” together in a neatly packaged box, I felt the need to simplify my identity.
As I began to actively think about my Blackness for the first time in my life, my immediate response was self-resentment. I was overcome with the agonizing feeling that I had renounced the right to claim my Black identity after failing to do so for so long. However, as I examined the origins of my denial, I realized that my experience was demonstrative of a very prevalent phenomenon in the Dominican Republic. Historically, the Dominican state has fostered a systematic erasure of Blackness from the DR’s national identity, directly linked to the strong anti-Haitian sentiment that characterizes the sociopolitical climate in the nation. Despite having gained independence from Spain for the second time in 1865, the Dominican Republic recognizes February 27, 1844 — the day the nation drove the Haitian army out of Santo Domingo — as its official day of independence. This decision precisely encapsulates the disconnect from my Blackness that has dominated my unsettling sense of self. The founding of the DR as an independent nation was predicated upon a fundamentally antagonistic relationship with our predominantly Black Haitian neighbors, and in turn, a proximity to the white Spanish colonizer. Further, an indoctrination campaign most potent during the military dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo perpetuated the racist and colorist claim that it is impossible to be both Black and Dominican without devaluing the latter. Realizing that I was simply another victim of the systemic anti-Blackness that pervades the DR, I stopped vilifying myself for discounting my Blackness.
My distance from the Caribbean nation has allowed me to recognize that my Spanish-speaking household does not at all change how I fundamentally navigate life in a Black body in the United States. This experience is what I have come to conclude is at the core of Afro-Latinidad.
The term Afro-Latina seems to have devolved into somewhat of a buzzword, but for me it is deeply significant. Embracing Afro-Latinidad liberates me from having to choose between aspects of my identity that I formerly believed to be mutually exclusive, as it allows me to feel secure in the fact that neither side of my racial and ethnic identity detracts from the other. Existing at the intersection of Black and Hispanic no longer produces the feeling of internal competition that I spent years attempting to expel. Afro-Latinidad has afforded me the opportunity for reconciliation that I needed to finally subdue the tensions between Black History Month and Dominican Independence Day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adams House’s Hampden Hall has been plagued by a string of vandalism — ranging from racist language and crude drawings to defaced photos and targeted notes — since at least last October.
Students who live in Hampden Hall, a six-floor swing housing complex located above the Harvard Bookstore, have reported ongoing graffiti and offensive notes left in the elevator and on bulletin boards, windowsills, and walls. Though the acts have been reported on multiple floors, they have been mostly concentrated on the third floor.
In a Wednesday email to Adams House residents, Faculty Deans Mercedes C. “Mercy” Becerra ’91 and Salmaan A. Keshavjee and Resident Dean Charles “Chip” Lockwood called the repeated acts “completely unacceptable” and “antithetical” to house expectations.
“We will continue to do everything we can to stop this, and anyone found responsible will face immediate disciplinary action,” they wrote.
The faculty deans also wrote that they had filed a report with the Harvard University Police Department and increased the presence of Securitas guards in the hall. Per HUPD records, the report was filed on Tuesday to investigate vandalism dating back to Oct. 1 of last year.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote that the graffiti and tagging filed in the report were “not bias-related,” and Tuesday night was the first time vandalism had been officially reported to the department.
Residents say that the vandalism has persisted over the course of several months. Hampden third-floor resident Emily E. Sanchez ’23 said she saw and crossed out the phrase “N-WORD,” in reference to the racist slur, written on a windowsill earlier this semester.
Last fall, residents on multiple floors noticed that their name tags had disappeared from their doors. Some name tags were crumpled in a pile and left on the first floor, per a November email resident tutors sent to their entryway.
Fifth-floor resident Emma F. Kearney ’22 wrote in an email that she found the disappearance of her nametag “odd,” but did not originally assume it was an act of vandalism.
Then, the acts began to “escalate,” Sanchez said, to graffiti akin to what “middle school teenage boys” might draw.
Throughout last semester, Sanchez said she noticed phallic drawings and crude language written on the elevator and third-floor bulletin board, where tutors had provided markers for students to leave notes.
Overnight on Dec. 10, several bulletin boards were torn down and a picture of the third-floor resident tutors and their family was stolen and defaced. Earlier that week, on the sixth floor, flyers were removed from a bulletin board and strewn about the ground.
On Dec. 13, Becerra, Keshavjee, and Lockwood penned an email to Hampden residents calling the acts of vandalism “unacceptable” and “insulting” and implored the perpetrators to stop.
“Adams House is far more than a collection of remarkable buildings. It is our home, and this type of behavior should not be accepted by any of us,” they wrote.
Some of the acts appeared to be targeted at a third-floor resident. Victor A. Rangel ’23, said he noticed comments written on bulletin boards targeting him by name in November. The first note asked him to “open a window,” which Rangel said insinuated he had been smoking in his dorm.
Rangel, who said he does not smoke, wrote below the note saying so. A flurry of notes later, including some defending Rangel, a bulletin board note that said “We beat Yale” was altered to say “We beat Victor.”
Then, again in early February, the words “Fuck yu” were added to a note on the bulletin board that originally contained a message of support — Victor’s name with a drawing of a heart.
Rangel said he believes the targeted notes could be partially “rooted in xenophobia or racism.”
“There’s at least 15 people living on our floor,” Rangel said. “So the fact that someone would assume that I, as the only Latino man living on the floor, am the one smoking at the entryway is crazy to me.”
Elizabeth I. Ogolo ’24, a Hampden resident, said the note “felt like a racially-motivated accusation.”
In response to the ongoing vandalism, some Adams entryways began the spring semester with meetings discussing communal living norms, according to tutor emails. The Adams House faculty deans also hosted a gathering Thursday.
In a Wednesday statement emailed to The Crimson, Becerra and Keshavjee, the Adams faculty deans, deplored the acts as “deeply hurtful” to Adams residents.
Some Adams residents said the incidents have changed their perception of safety in the entryway.
“Knowing that there are people of color on my floor, knowing that my proctors are Black people, knowing that I’m a Black person, knowing that the only people that seem to rarely be victimized in a lot of these situations happen to be white leaves a terrible taste in my mouth,” Ogolo said.
Sanchez, who recently applied to transfer out of Adams, said ongoing vandalism was a factor in her decision.
“I have no idea why anybody is doing it, don't know who it is,” Sanchez said. “All I know is that it’s kind of annoying. It’s annoying and insensitive, and it doesn’t make Hampden feel like an entryway or like a home.”

Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine hung flyers across campus last week urging undergraduates to boycott Harvard Israel Trek, an annual subsidized spring break trip to Israel and the West Bank.
Organizers for HOOP — a student group spearheaded by the Palestine Solidarity Committee that calls on Harvard to divest holdings linked to Israel’s presence in Palestine — posted flyers with QR codes linked to a document that alleges trip-goers are “complicit in apartheid and settler colonialism.”
In 2019, the PSC distributed a petition urging undergraduates to boycott Israel Trek, which was ultimately canceled due to Covid-19.
Applications for this year’s trip closed last October. According to Israel Trek student leader Ty L. Geri ’23, more than 450 students applied for just 100 spots.
The trip includes a visit of the West Bank and discussions with high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian officials. In emails about the trip sent last semester, organizers say the trip provides participants an opportunity to explore “unique and nuanced realities at the core of Israel’s geopolitical landscape.”
HOOP organizer Christian B. Tabash ’21-’22 said he rejects the idea that the trip can provide a balanced perspective on the conflict between Israel and Palestine despite including the West Bank on its itinerary.
“It doesn’t matter if you spend a few hours in the West Bank, a day in the West Bank, a few days in the West Bank, or if you talk to a Palestinian,” Tabash said. “That is irrelevant, because power is unequal and Palestinians exist as the colonized.”
Nadine S. Bahour ’22, who is also a HOOP organizer, said she does not oppose Harvard students visiting the region but rather the way the trip “sells itself to be a balanced perspective.”
“You’re going at the expense of Palestinian refugees — over five million Palestinian refugees that can’t visit the region,” Bahour said.
As part of its campaign, HOOP has compared attending Israel Trek to visiting South Africa during apartheid. A poster hung around campus reads, “Would you go on a trip funded by South African apartheid? No? Why go on Israel Trek?”
Geri said he respects HOOP’s right to put up the posters, but disagrees with their claims.
“We’ve designed this itinerary to give the participants the opportunity to actually challenge these questions, ask these questions, ask the things that are on the poster, perhaps, to people on the ground that are trying to make a difference,” Geri said. “That’s an incredibly unique opportunity.”
Estela Lacombe Fran​​ça ’23, who is attending Israel Trek this spring, said despite the boycott’s claims she believes the trip leaders are committed to providing a “diverse” perspective.
“The leaders are just constantly willing to speak to us about anything that we are concerned about,” Franca said. “They make a really conscious effort to make sure that we have access to as many varied viewpoints as possible.”
Tabash said the best way for students to become educated about Palestine is through attending events hosted by the PSC and HOOP.
“The space in which Palestinians congregate and find community and organize, that is the best space at Harvard in which you’ll actually learn about the reality of this Israel-Palestine issue,” Tabash said.

Local affordable housing advocates are calling for Cambridge to select a city manager who will prioritize lowering the city’s high cost of living as the search to replace Louis A. DePasquale begins.
The selection process for a new Cambridge city manager kicked off last month, and the city is expected to select its next top official in May. The Cambridge City Council has pledged to seek public input in the process via town hall meetings, an online discussion forum, and diverse focus groups.
Cambridge follows a council-manager form of government in which the city manager — not the mayor — is the most powerful public official. While the city council is tasked with establishing the city’s goals and policies, the city manager runs the day-to-day operations of the government and controls its budget.
On Feb. 13, A Better Cambridge — a local affordable housing organization — released a letter calling for the next city manager to prioritize transparency, data-driven feedback, and affordable housing issues.
In the letter, the group said the city manager has a big sway over housing issues as the overseer of the municipal budget.
“We’ve always been glad to see money spent on housing in a whole bunch of different buckets,” Rebecca “Becca” M. Schofield, co-chair of A Better Cambridge, said in an interview. “But I think we are really hopeful that, with the next city manager, we’ll be able to ramp up that spending and see some innovative solutions within the budget to current housing issues.”
In the letter, the group also called for the city manager to “embrace the possibilities of a growing and changing Cambridge,” instead of following the “status quo.”
“The next City Manager must be prepared to take bold leadership in guiding both medium-term and long-term urban plans that are responsive to our housing crisis and include real steps towards ending it,” the letter said. “Candidates should not see the job of City Manager simply as an ‘administrative caretaker’ role, merely preserving and protecting the status quo.”
Just a Start — another local affordable housing organization — calls for a similar vision.
“I think you’d want a manager that can continue to support and lead the very strong staff that currently exists in the city. At the same time, I think the city is at a point, and has the opportunity to do some bold things,” Carl Nagy-Koechlin, executive director of Just a Start, said in an interview.
The organizations also advocate for a city manager who will prioritize diversity in policy making decisions.
Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor who runs the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said the city’s next top official should prioritize incorporating data-driven feedback.
“We want a city manager who’s going to hire highly qualified staff and to look at data in a thoughtful way as one is making decisions,” Blier said.
Some advocates lauded the City Council’s efforts to incorporate a wide range of stakeholder feedback in the selection process.
“I have been impressed with the process,” Blier said. “I think that the vice mayor, who is leading it, has done a very good job — and others who were in the mayor’s office — in reaching out to many people.”

The City of Cambridge announced a $2.5 million restaurant and nightlife relief grant program for businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this month.
The program will award grants of $10,000 to eligible businesses, prioritizing those owned by people of color, women, and other historically marginalized groups as well as those which have not been recipients of previous grants.
The American Rescue Plan Act will finance the awards, which will be available to “local, non-franchise cafes, restaurants, and entertainment venues (e.g. movie theaters, performance venues, galleries, entertainment promoters),” according to a press release announcing the program. Cambridge was allocated $88.1 million in ARPA funding to distribute for the purposes of local economic recovery.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui praised the economic relief effort in the press release.
“The uncertainty of the last two years has made operations difficult for restaurants and nightlife venues,” Siddiqui wrote. “These grants, which will prioritize some of our hardest hit businesses, will help restaurants and nightlife venues that have a long road to recovery.”
Theodora M. “Theo” Skeadas ’12, executive director of small business advocacy group Cambridge Local First, said the effort to support businesses is much warranted.
“These are businesses that are historically under-resourced relative to their more advantaged peers, and have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,” Skeadas said. “I applaud their efforts to provide additional resources to business owners and businesses that are most adversely hit by the pandemic and all of the challenges that it entails.”
The grant’s focus on restaurants and nightlife operations will extend Covid-19 relief to organizations which may have been excluded from previous federally funded grant efforts.
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a press release that recovering Cambridge’s nightlife is “critical to our city.”
“Cambridge’s restaurants and nightlife venues are a vital part of our community and these sectors have been among the hardest hit by this pandemic,” he wrote.
Kari Kuelzer, owner of Harvard Square restaurant and bar Grendel’s Den, said the announced grants were a small step in the right direction.
“When you’re the scale of a business like Grendel’s, most of the city programs provide only sort of a drop in the bucket amount of support. They barely pay a week of your rent,” she said. “It's been a really rough road. I think every little bit helps.”
Zina Thompson, owner of Zina’s Hairdressing and a member of a city-wide advisory committee for Black, Indigenous, and people of color-owned businesses, said Cambridge was doing an “amazing job of supporting businesses.”
“They came to help us at such a crucial time,” Thompson said. “It's a great thing for the younger generations to see how minorities can make it in this world.”
The Cambridge Community Development Department plans to offer further relief programs in the coming months, according to its spokesperson Brianna Garcia.
“The City will continue to find ways to support our local businesses as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 crisis and the community’s economic recovery,” Garcia wrote in an emailed statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department is investigating a racist attack levied against Harvard Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 earlier this month.
After two signs calling Cheng a racist anti-Asian slur and bearing the phrase “SAVE THE UC” were discovered on Cheng’s door in Quincy House earlier this month, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano confirmed the department is investigating the incident as a “bias-related suspicious act.”
Following the incident, Quincy Faculty Deans Eric Beerbohm and Leslie J. Duhaylongsod deplored the flyers and offered their support to Cheng in an email to House residents.
“We want to say in the strongest possible terms that this is absolutely unacceptable; none of these actions is consistent with Quincy’s focus on a safe, respectful, and inclusive community,” they wrote.
In their email, the Quincy faculty deans also solicited information about the incident.
Beerbohm and Duhaylongsod did not respond to an inquiry about the HUPD investigation.
Support for Cheng poured in following the attack. The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Association released a statement, co-signed by 24 student groups, rebuking the “act of direct racism” and demanding stronger support for students of color at Harvard.
The UC also drafted a statement of solidarity, which was then rejected by Cheng, who called the move hypocritical and reiterated his belief that the perpetrator was a UC member.
“The person or people that are responsible for yesterday’s hateful attack, as well as the multiple kinds of other attacks targeting me, are potentially in this room right now,” he said at a UC meeting.
Cheng was elected UC president in November following a contentious campaign in which promised to “defund” the body and rewrite its constitution. His administration has been at odds with some general UC members since the election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 25, 2022 at 4:31 p.m.
The United States Department of Justice announced Wednesday it would shutter its controversial China Initiative, an anti-espionage crackdown that ensnared a top Harvard faculty member last year.
Several high-profile academics — including Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber — were charged under the program. Lieber, the former chair of Harvard’s Chemistry Department, was convicted of lying to federal authorities about his ties to a China-backed recruitment initiative last December.
Lieber is set to be sentenced at a later date — but experts say the DOJ’s move to end the China Initiative is unlikely to impact his fate.
“The underlying laws are the same,” said Derek Adams, a partner at the Potomac Law Group. “It’s not like you can’t bring a legal case based on allegedly false statements in connection with a grant application — you can.”
The China Initiative has long faced criticism for allegedly targeting individuals of Chinese descent and straying from its initial goals.
In a speech at George Mason University’s National Security Institute on Wednesday, Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen said the Justice Department is moving away from the program in part because of concerns over racial targeting.
“By grouping cases under the China Initiative rubric, we helped give rise to a harmful perception that the department applies a lower standard to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct related to that country or that we in some way view people with racial, ethnic or familial ties to China differently,” he said.
Adams said Lieber’s case is different from others grouped under the China Initiative. Unlike other academics charged under the program, he said, Lieber was charged with making false statements in interviews with investigators.
“It wasn’t based on a cold record of documents,” he said. “It was really tied to his alleged statements, when he made those statements to the government.”
In January 2020, Lieber told FBI agents that he “wasn’t completely transparent” in a separate interview with federal investigators two years earlier, according to a video clip of the interrogation played by prosecutors during the December 2021 trial.
Lieber was found guilty on two counts of lying to federal investigators and four counts of tax fraud.
Michael German, a former FBI agent who serves as a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, said the case against Lieber represented an example of the China Initiative’s overreach.
“The China Initiative was designed to stop espionage and trade theft by the Chinese government — it had nothing to do with an academic engaging in tax fraud,” he said. “It was an example of how an initiative designed to address one problem in fact was targeting people who had relationships with individuals or entities in China.”
German said the program spurred anti-Asian bias.
“This has been a long-standing problem, and I think the China Initiative just crystallized the bias that was already apparent in these Chinese espionage investigations,” he said.
Academics and advocates previously called on the Biden administration to wind down the initiative, warning of a chilling effect on academic collaboration abroad. In a Jan. 5 letter to President Joe Biden, more than 50 organizations — including the Brennan Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and APA Justice Task Force — urged Biden to end the program.
“We respectfully request that your administration end the Justice Department’s ‘China Initiative,’ and take further steps necessary to combat the pervasive racial bias and targeting of Asian American and Asian immigrant scientists, researchers, and students,” the letter said.
Robert A. Fisher — a defense attorney for MIT professor Gang Chen, who was charged under the China Initiative in 2021 before his case was dropped by prosecutors last January — said the DOJ’s move to nix the program came as no surprise.
“It seems like they’re really just getting back to the roots of the program which were anti-espionage, trade secret theft, economic espionage — going after legitimate spies in the U.S., which is what they should have been doing all along — and away from what it morphed into, which were the grant fraud cases,” he said.
However, the program’s closure is unlikely to affect Lieber’s conviction, Fisher said.
“They knew the Lieber case was going to trial in December — it was under this administration,” he said. “I think the review was clearly going on then. I’m sure the Lieber case was received, and the decision was made that his case would have been done regardless.”
On Feb. 7, attorneys for Lieber filed a motion for an acquittal or a new trial, over a month after his initial conviction.
Lieber’s attorney, Marc L. Mukasey, did not respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office of Massachusetts declined to comment on Lieber’s case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences is set to consider a proposal that would allow remotely-taught Harvard Summer School courses to be taken for Harvard College credit.
Previously, the College accepted only a subset of Summer School courses for credit, all taught in-person. But the school made an exception during the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing remote courses to count for college credit.
The Harvard Faculty Council approved a proposal to allow online summer school classes to count for credit at its Jan. 26 meeting, sending the proposal to the full FAS. The faculty will consider the matter at its March 1 meeting.
The Harvard College Student Handbook currently states that “Harvard College students may not count online Summer School courses toward their Harvard College degrees.”
The proposal comes after the FAS' Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy was tasked with re-evaluating the matter.
Ahead of the faculty meeting’s vote on March 1, students have voiced support for the proposal.
Benjamin T. Rossen ’24 said allowing remote Summer School courses to be taken for credit would change how students approach structuring their education.
“I think it would definitely change the landscape and how people perceive class because even now the ability to learn remotely and to attend lectures asynchronously has definitely changed people's schedules and how people prioritize going to lectures,” Rossen said.
Rossen added he believes the virtual course offerings would make people feel accustomed to taking more classes than normal.
“Generally, you take four classes at Harvard, but I think with the virtual format, it might be even easier to take five or even six because of the convenience,” Rossen said.
Hannah S. Lamport ’23 echoed similar sentiments, adding that it could create a new course load standard.
“It could free people's schedules up so that over the fall and spring semesters they have time to take other courses outside of the standard requirements that they finish off during the summer," Lamport said. "That being said, it could alternatively create a culture where you’re kind of expected to get more classes in."
Alfonso J. Godinez Aguilar ’24, who plans to take Harvard Summer School courses this summer to fulfill concentration requirements, said he thinks the proposal would make summer school more “accessible” for him and other students.
“It would be an overall net positive thing just because it would make summer school more accessible for students that potentially might want to do internships or something somewhere else, or if they have family commitments over the summer,” Godinez Aguilar said.
“I think before the pandemic, people didn’t really value virtual school as much as they do now after having a good year of virtual school — like last year — under our belt, so I think definitely a lot of people’s minds have changed,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two students at the College launched a peer therapy group last semester that employs empirically validated psychotherapy techniques focusing on interpersonal relationships to combat anxiety and depression.
Harvard Undergraduate Peer Therapy, led by Suhaas M. Bhat ’23-’24 and Eric H. Li ’23-’24, uses a therapy method called interpersonal psychotherapy, or IPT, to provide small groups of six to eight students with support during an eight to 10-week program.
Bhat and Li say they were motivated to act based on the “mental health crisis on campus” and the dearth of mental health professionals in the greater Boston area. They finished their pilot group last semester and are launching their third group in the next couple of weeks.
“Therapy has, in the last decade or so, attained a dizzying height of cultural importance,” Bhat said. “Now when people are struggling, the number one advice is go to therapy. I don't think it was like that 20 years ago.”
Bhat and Li said that one of the goals of their program was to increase accessibility to therapy by making it more responsive and affordable.
“I've been trying to schedule an appointment [with a private mental health provider] lately. It's so incredibly expensive and especially during the pandemic now,” Bhat said. “Demand is spiking and supply is frozen.”
The application process for HUGPT consists of a brief consultation to see if IPT suits a given student’s needs.
Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services advises the group and agreed to greenlight the program after Bhat and Li presented the IPT model to them.
“What IPT is ultimately interested in writing is helping you create strong, healthy relationships and communicate your emotions healthily in those relationships,” Bhat said.
Scott Stuart, the director of the IPT Institute which certifies facilitators of IPT, said the Institute has trained more than 6,000 facilitators since its founding, but Bhat and Li are the first undergraduate students to be certified.
“We have had people from university counseling services who are on staff come to training so that's not unusual at all,” Stuart said. “This is the first time, to my knowledge, that there are undergrad students who are doing it on the college campus.”
“While many modes of therapy require a therapist with years of subject area expertise, the beauty of IPT-G is that the group does the real therapy — the facilitator simply guides the process,” the HUGPT website reads. “Each and every person has spent many years navigating intricate and complex relationships, and our goal as facilitators is to allow members of the group to lead each other, learning and growing as they face challenges together.”
An average session consists of a brief initial group check-in, followed by the main focus of the session, which will vary from week to week, Li said. For instance, one week might focus on role transitions and students’ experience of entering college life. The goal of the session would be to structure their understanding of themselves and their relationships.
Harvard already offers several peer counseling programs, including Contact, ECHO, and Room 13, among others. However, there are significant differences between peer counseling services and IPT, per Stuart.
“Generally speaking, peer counseling is more supportive,” Stuart said. “Peer counselors generally are not trained in specific kinds of evidence-based practices for depression or anxiety.”
“For instance, peer counseling might work very well if somebody is having difficulty with loneliness or a sense of isolation,” Stuart added. “But if somebody has a diagnosis of depression, for example, or a diagnosis of panic disorder, peer counseling is probably not going to be sufficient to treat that.”
Stuart said that IPT is not exclusively reserved for people with diagnosed mental illnesses and those who are potentially headed toward a diagnosis can benefit from treatment as well. For that reason, he said HUGPT fills a demand for a preventive intervention for students at risk for depression or anxiety at Harvard.
“I think it's got tremendous potential for reaching a lot of people who really need preventive services,” Stuart said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and affiliates reacted with shock and horror to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a military invasion of Ukraine in the early morning local time on Thursday.
Explosions rocked cities across the country, including Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a massive escalation in a war between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists that has been ongoing for over seven years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced 137 Ukranians have been killed since the invasion began, in a speech on Friday shortly after midnight local time.
Georgiy A. Kent ’22, a former president of the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers, organized an “emergency” ringing of the bells Thursday afternoon where they performed the Ukrainian national anthem.
“Given the news with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, I decided that the Lowell Bells could do a symbolic gesture in solidarity and show our support for Ukraine,” Kent said.
He said the Bell Ringers hoped to send the message that “we support the Ukrainian people's decision to be a free and sovereign nation, and we support democracy and peace.”
Ilya Timtchenko, a U.S. citizen of Ukrainian background and chair of the Ukrainian Caucus at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the invasion of Ukraine gave him flashbacks to the Euromaidan protests of 2013-2014, which led to the ousting of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
“It is a flashback in terms of where you see people getting worried, unifying, trying to resist, or resisting what Russia is trying to do,” he said. “But at the same time, right now, the scale is much bigger.”
“There, you’re dealing with protests, whereas right now you’re dealing with a full fledged war,” Timtchenko said.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf warned that war in Ukraine meant that the world will be fundamentally changed in a message sent to HKS affiliates on Thursday.
“The consequences of this war will extend well beyond Ukraine,” Elmendorf wrote.
He said the Kennedy School plans to host a series of discussions to “understand the causes and consequences of what is happening in Ukraine,” including an event with professor and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash B. Carter that will “probably” be held at an Institute of Politics forum next Wednesday.
Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian research associate at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, said she was grateful for the outpouring of support from her colleagues at HKS.
“Everyone basically came out and reached out to me and expressed their horror, but also their words of concern for my family back in Ukraine,” she said. “I just can’t emphasize enough how, even though that seems like such a small thing, how in a time like this, that kind of support matters.”
Nadezhda Vikulina, a graduate student, said she attended a protest outside the Massachusetts State House on Thursday to show that as a Russian, she is opposed to the war.
“The war is horrifying, and we have very little power or choice to be involved in the war at all,” she said. “None of my friends from Russia — not a single person I know — is rooting for this war.”
Polina Galouchko ’23, a Russian citizen, said she is now being forced to reconsider her relationship with her home country.
“I don’t feel like I identify anymore with the country that wages a war on its neighbors,” she said.
Alexander Zhigalin ’23, an international student from Russia, said he is afraid student visas for Russian citizens will stop being issued or that existing visas will be nullified as part of Western sanctions against Russia.
“It’s very uncertain if I’d be even able to stay on the student visa — if I’d be even able to finish Harvard, let alone stay here in the U.S.,” he said. “That's very hard to predict and just gives you a very hopeless feeling.”
Leise H. Sandeman, an HKS student, organized a joint petition between public policy schools at Harvard, Oxford, and Princeton to condemn the invasion of Ukraine. As of Thursday evening, the petition had amassed more than 300 responses, two-thirds of which were from HKS.
“It’s absolutely necessary to show solidarity with Ukraine and with the Ukrainian people,” Sandeman said. “Silence is truly complacency in this case.”

With my very healthy five hours of sleep a night, I’m a little out of it at times. So hearing that an electric shuttle bus crashed into Tasty Burger the same day as a bank robbery made me do a double take. This is Harvard — we should not even be approaching the level of drama of Euphoria. But the future is a mystery, so take this bingo as a present and predict the next shocking occurrence to happen in and around Harvard Square.
