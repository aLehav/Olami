“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” When the opening sentence of Leo Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina” surfaces in the musings of Paul Lohman, narrator of Herman Koch’s “The Dinner,” it evokes a sense of inevitability—some threshold has been crossed, but there is no obvious explanation offered as to what has occurred. Allusions to the source of some persistent disquiet tease and tempt; glimpses of missing puzzle pieces are proffered only to disappear and resurface many pages later. It’s an addictive spectacle; bit by excruciating bit, Koch exposes the astounding manner in which the Lohman family is courting unhappiness.
Despite borrowing a driving sentiment from Tolstoy, “The Dinner” is more than capable of standing up for itself. Out of Koch’s six novels, originally written in Dutch, it is the only one that has been published in English thus far. Translator Sam Garrett has done an excellent job: the novel’s layers of plot combine with the distinct voice of the narrator to such an effect that it’s hard to believe much, if anything, was lost in translation. Things start out innocently enough. Two brothers—one poised to become prime minister and the other a former history teacher—and their wives meet for dinner at an upscale Amsterdam restaurant, but family drama slides into a psychological thriller almost without notice. They have come together to discuss their sons, whose horrifying actions go far beyond the expected teenage vexations, necessitating life-changing decisions for both families.
History teacher Paul’s first person narration initially seems stilted, almost painfully so. The narrator’s thoughts seem too censored, characterizing him as abnormally detached even when discussing sensitive social issues like class and immigration. However, his level voice thrives in the escalating situation, and soon Paul becomes the most sympathetic character; after all, it’s difficult to think of something more stifling than the elaborate production that is a formal dinner undertaken out of obligation to your famous sibling. Here is Paul Lohman: thoughtful, blunt, intelligent but not excessively so, an ordinary man who is still very much in love with his wife of 20 years and who clearly cares deeply for his only child. He is relentlessly willing to skewer everything—not only the absurd mannerisms of the maitre d’, who pontificates the pedigree of every component of a tiny dish of olives, but also the extroverted, yet ultimately uninteresting personality of his politician brother Serge—employing wit a shade more corrosive than merely dark. Yet this acidity, coupled with a resolute reasonableness and juxtaposed with Serge’s concocted mannerisms, makes Paul an alluring and trustworthy narrator; acclimation to the halting, digressive style comes soon enough and eventually sinks into a believable denial that anything felt strange in the first place.
The events of the novel parallel the progress of the meal, with each new course interrupting digressions into memory and reasserting present tensions, producing a piecemeal reconstruction of the boys’ actions and assorted events that might contextualize or justify them. With each interruption, the presentation of food becomes more absurd. Hearing about how “the blackberries are from our own garden [and] the parfait is made from homemade chocolate, and these are shaved almonds mixed with grated walnuts,” builds near unbearable suspense and an appreciation for Paul’s desire to snap, “I know, because that’s what I ordered”; it seems high time to proceed to devour the real meat of the story—Paul’s flashbacks. Yet these recollections can be frustratingly vague, especially when contrasted with the excruciating detail in which Paul describes everything from the restaurant men’s room to his brother’s interest in wine and his son’s attire. “I won’t say which restaurant because next time it might be full of people who’ve come to see whether we’re there,” Paul claims on the very first page, and this reticence continues throughout; myriad crucial points, such as the nature of his wife’s illness, are considered either too private or too unimportant to merit reporting.
While the excessive description of events in the present and an infuriating tendency to gloss over the specifics of major plot points would be obvious flaws when taken separately, together they form a believable reconstruction of events as presented by a narrator directly involved in the action of the book. Paul is compelling, even as it gradually becomes apparent that he is neither as reliable nor as normal as he first appears. The vagueness makes the story seem less distant; the lingering questions give it a way under the skin, where it stays, refusing to budge.
Paul’s perspective and opinions can be unsettling, particularly as the many events of “The Dinner,” whether explicitly or indirectly, center on sensitive social or moral issues: capital punishment, class, racism, immigration, homelessness, prenatal genetic diagnosis. Koch’s approach to these issues is really just pouring salt in a wound: it doesn’t solve the problem—indeed, the “answers” offered by the characters raise more questions than they put to rest—but it certainly creates a rich forum in which Koch’s cynical narrator can thrive.

The Harvard Kennedy School is known for impassioned speeches and debates about the current state of politics, not of art. Yet on February 28,  students and faculty from the Graduate School of Design and the Graduate School of Education squeezed into a small room of HKS’s Taubman Building for a panel entitled, “Are Arts Relevant in a 21st Century World?” organized by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations. Within five minutes, one of the panelists, Carol Coletta, director of the nonprofit organization ArtPlace, answered with a rhetorical question: “Is breathing relevant?”
After her joking retort, the panelists moved on to practical discussions. Rather than discuss the initial prompt, the panelists used their time to consider concrete initiatives for making art more relevant.
There was no doubt among the panelists that the place of the arts in contemporary information society is under siege. Jim Bildner, who moderated the event, and is a Senior Research Fellow at the Hauser Center specializing on the sustainability of the arts in US cities, reported that foundational giving to the arts declined by 10 percent since the 2007-2009 recession. Though they are now beginning to recover some of their financial footing, Bildner said, arts and cultural institutions can no longer rely exclusively on the patronage of artistic elites, who flock to the opera, theater, and ballet in dwindling numbers.
Dennis Scholl, the other panelist and Vice President of Arts for the Knight Foundation, a private nonprofit for media innovation, proposed a solution. “The only way the arts can stay relevant in the 21st century is by becoming part of the community and allowing more people to participate,” he said. To that end, Scholl talked about the national initiative he launched called “Random Acts of Culture,” which organizes spontaneous flash mobs to Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” and opera performances in public malls, as well as other cultural events.  In a clip that he showed of one of these acts, unsuspecting bystanders showed their enthusiasm by whipping out their iPhones rather than actually participating. But Scholl did not seem perturbed by this reaction. “How many people in a concert hall participate? The point is they were there to witness it,” he said after the panel.
 Coletta, also a former Knight Foundation fellow, has taken up Scholl’s concept of taking the arts to the streets but has the art a more permanent setting. Her organization, ArtPlace, has awarded $26.9 million in the form of 80 grants to 76 organizations in 46 places in the US  in cross-collaboration with leading artists, banks, municipal governments, federal agencies, and the National Endowment for the Arts. “[Our mission is to] put ‘art’ at the ‘heart’ of portfolio strategies to transform community,” she said.  What this means is investing in the arts a profitable and sustainable public-private venture. ArtPlace is unique, however, in not thinking about urban art as beautification but as “creative placemaking,” which, according to ArtPlace’s website, is a strategy that aims to use art to revitalize overlooked spaces.
Instead, as a seasoned CEO,  she discussed the metrics used to measure the projects’ success: the “vibrancy” and “diversity” they add to the community. “These metrics can be fuzzy,” she said. However, much data-collection and reporting went into their calculation, Coletta said to the audience.
More than one audience member took issue with the metrics. Other audience members questioned why art needs to produce a return on investment to be valuable. At this point, Bildner spoke up. “Of course art is inherently valuable. The question is whether it is being valued by as many people as it could,” he said.
The two panelists’ aspirations have a common thread: to popularize the arts and their practical applications and to shift conversation about the arts away from the Barker Center and into the Kennedy School, thus making art an effective policy tool for change.

Ned Beauman’s smart second novel delights, perhaps a little too zealously, in casting off the gravitas of the politically correct. “The Teleportation Accident” presents itself as a comedy about the failure of philosophical axioms, the superfluity of time, and the inadequacy of history in accounting for human experience. Yet its almost offensively extravagant presentation of these cerebral murmurings, from the over-saturation in cross-genre pastiches to the at-times gaudy excessiveness of its language, make it a limited success in realizing its ambitions. 
When the first axiom of your existence is that “accidents, like women, allude,” you are free to proceed logically from there without questioning whether accidents or women are worth alluding to. This is the mindset of Egon Loeser, whose character, like his name—pronounced in German like the word “loser”—presents an anti-heroism as blatant as it gets. Loeser is the stage designer whose Teleportation Device breaks down on opening night, the pathetic sex-starved Berlin bohemian who crosses oceans for an unattainable vagina only to give it up when he finally has the chance, the American refugee too lazy to read through the letters of his Jewish friend who is being persecuted in Europe. Meantime, Loeser encounters an American scientist who is reinventing the Teleportation Device that his predecessor, one Lavicini of 1600s Venice, was presented in a disastrous theater show centuries ago. But Loeser, egoist-expiring-in-self-pity that he is, cannot help but ignore the making of history around him, turning his back on the Holocaust and the poisonous intrigues surrounding the Device. 
Not only does Loeser fail us by making a holy mess of every opportunity he is given, but he also has no appreciation for the historical significance of what he’s going through. His Hitler is not Adolf, who he hardly thinks of at all, but Adele Hitler, a beautiful girl he wants desperately to sleep with. However, Beauman’s narrative is ironic not only in its presentation of Loeser’s political ignorance, but also in that it philosophically agrees with Loeser. The Teleportation Device, which scientists in warring countries are all scrambling to build, is a machine for transporting objects instantaneously to a different location: “A teleportation device would have to convince the object in the chamber that it wouldn’t matter if it were somewhere else.” As Loeser lives mostly outside of time, he is as if inside the Teleportation Device himself. Ultimately, Loeser recognizes the subjectivity of all experiences lived in time:
One is always wrong, he thought, always, always wrong, about every single thing; if some young cousin was ever stupid enough to ask him for his advice about life, that was all he would be able to tell them. The truth ran back and forth over your head at night but you never saw so much as the colour of its fur.
Thus, Beauman’s novel does not trivialize a notorious historical landmark like the Holocaust, but supercedes it in showing that our experiences of history are more subjective than we think; time breaks down and ceases to matter, so that the differences of space also disappear, and thus the concept of teleportation becomes possible. The novel quotes Lucretius, “There is void in all things,” to illustrate a void as wide as that of the Holocaust hanging over not only the Jews, but even the lonely German. Even without the Teleportation Device, Beauman’s characters struggle with the inevitable convergence of experiences from past into the present time and the sense of placelessness that the Teleportation Device represents.
In keeping with the novel’s critique of history as an artificial construction, a standout feature of the book is its architecturally complex plotting. The conventional chronological narration is enlivened by passages alternating past and present narratives that “allude” to each other in the close space of a shared page. The novel’s structural originality is especially visible in its “Zeitgeisterbahnhöfe” at the end, four separate scenes detailing the parallel final destinies of characters from each excerpt in the novel’s span of centuries. These four endings are a fitting end to a book that refuses to conclude itself in a chronologically tidy way and so links and complicates the fates of each character across time as more revelations are made from each perspective. When Beauman’s style is at its best, the witticisms hit smack center, managing to be both funny and poignant. However, he overshoots in some extended similes; for example, a minor character is described as “a tall gaunt man with small narrow eyes set deep in his skull like two old sisters trying to spy out of the windows of their house without being noticed themselves.” Similarly, the book’s many allusive nods to various literary greats—Rilke, Whitman, James, and Nietzsche all get their mention—fire up our neural pathways with the associations they conjure up, but the hurried delivery of these names borders on facetious.
On a larger scale, there’s something unpleasantly aggressive in the energy with which Beauman pushes this rule-breaking novel. In its promiscuity with literary genres—the novel has affairs with detective fiction, science fiction, and romance—it does not always manage to get itself out of the clichés picked up from these stereotype-mining trysts. Character originality is sacrificed on the altar of literary cleverness, as in the hard-boiled confession made to Loeser by one Dolores Mutton, a housewife-turned-spy trying to lay hands on the Teleportation Device:
"I don’t care what happens to me anymore. I don’t care if I get locked up for spying. I don’t even care if Drabsfarben shoots me and dumps my body in the ocean. But Stent can’t know. I love that man more than anything else in the world. I love that man so much it makes me grind my teeth at night. If he found out I’d been fooling him for our entire marriage... That’s why I can’t stop. If I stop doing what Drabsfarben says, he’ll make sure Stent finds out about everything I did."
Speeches like this noir parody are charming and clever, but unfortunately distract from rather than enhance our understanding of the book’s more serious side. The novel’s haunting final lines, a numb individual at the end of time repeating “I don’t know where I am,” dips into this side again. In such close encounters with the “void” that stands outside of human noise, the final revelation of this existentialist undertow is such that the novel dilates and speaks with the glow of understanding. But Beauman, in his flight of well-intentioned linguistic enthusiasm, has delivered too many genre mashups and over-the-top verbal stunts that are not integrated well enough into the heart of his novel to resonate beyond their surface charm.  The intelligence of “The Teleportation Accident,” for all its glad existential moments of felicitous insight, still seems more a species of precocity than of wisdom.

Italian-born conductor Federico Cortese has branched out from his family of diplomats and his law degree: he has performed with some of the most esteemed orchestras in the world and has travelled everywhere from Houston to Sydney as a guest conductor. He now heads the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra and the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and he teaches a class on conducting at Harvard. The former music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cortese has conducted at the Tanglewood Music Festival, the Spoleto Festival in Florence, the Finnish National Opera, and numerous other festivals all over the globe.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you decide to become a conductor?
Federico Cortese: I’m ashamed to say it, but I’m afraid I decided to become a conductor for all the wrong reasons. It’s a particularly common boy’s disease—in this, girls are much wiser. I think that we boys develop this interest based on the misconception that when you’re up there, you lead—you’re the boss, and you make sound just by moving your hands—all of which is all wrong, totally wrong. The reality is very different. When you’re up there, no one is looking up at you. People are much less impressed by your movements. You’re not making any music—the orchestra is making music and you’re trying to lead it in the direction that you want, provided you know how to lead it and where to lead it to.
THC: What is it like to conduct versus to teach conducting?
FC: Conducting is borderline impossible to teach. It’s the result of years of experience. There are some basic things—how to beat a four-four, how to stay clear in your beat—but these are pretty trivial…. So we try to present the students with what will later on be the challenges of being a conductor: the understanding of the score, the knowledge of the style, so that when you start [conducting], you’re not just beating—you have an idea of the sound. The beating is just a function of it. Otherwise, it’s like teaching poetry by giving basic grammar lessons…. About conducting: I don’t think that many HRO people realize it, but when we are making music together, there is no difference between the students and the conductor.... It’s their performance as much as mine. When I am with HRO, I really feel we are in the same boat. When I teach, we are in two different boats. The goal is not to make something together—the goal is to try to teach something to the students and develop the qualities they already have.
THC: You studied law as well as music. How have you used your law degree?
FC: The degree is sitting in my drawer somewhere—I have no idea where it is. I think it’s in Rome, but I’m not sure.
THC: Is there anything you’d like to add?
FC: One thing: I do think that always, everything in life...HRO, and to some extent the experiments I am doing with music performance classes, are always a work in progress. So I never take the rules of the past as the only possible way. You certainly need to start from that—you don’t want to break traditions—but you need to update things. You need to find ways to better serve not just the musicians, but the community at Harvard and in general. I am trying to find ways so that music-making can become more relevant in the life of the students, and not just a little hobby.

The cover art of David Bowie’s newest album, “The Next Day,” is a modified version of the cover of his 1977 album, “Heroes.” A large white square obscures the photograph of Bowie that graced the cover of “Heroes,” and the older album’s title is crossed out. The cover of “The Next Day” suggests that Bowie, while highly conscious of what his newest album owes to his past work, is insisting that this new and unexpected release be regarded as a classic in its own right. Although judging an album by its cover is always a risky enterprise, Bowie effectively demands that we do so, and the cover art of “The Next Day” is not misleading. In his newest album, Bowie stays close to his artistic roots but does not simply imitate his past work, providing an engaging album that can stand both on its own and proudly alongside his previous albums.
The album opens with the title track, an energetic, percussion-fueled piece with raw power maintained by distorted guitar riffs and Bowie’s snarling vocals. “Here I am, not quite dying / My body left to rot in a hollow tree,” he growls in the chorus, but the singer seems as alive as ever, and the vitality and vigor of this title track is sustained throughout the album. “The Next Day” covers a shocking breadth of thematic ground,  ranging from “I’d Rather Be High,” a psychedelic anti-war song told from the point of view of a shell-shocked soldier, to “Valentine’s Day,” a melodic track with a twangy guitar riff that almost allows its audience to forget its dark subject matter: a prospective high school shooter on the verge of a mass murder.
Although the cover art suggests that “The Next Day” is heavily influenced by “Heroes”—the second album of Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, which was recorded in Germany and was hugely concerned with the atmosphere of the Cold War—Bowie’s new album seems to use the older album mainly as a reference for comparison rather than a source of inspiration. The album’s first single “Where Are We Now?” name-drops many iconic sights in Berlin, from Potsdamer Platz to the colossal department store KaDeWe, clearly harkening back to the Berlin Trilogy. However, Bowie departs cleanly and easily from his earlier tropes as he moves further into the album, nodding to his past work without becoming mired in the tried-and-true formula for success that he discovered on “Heroes.”
The triumph of “The Next Day” is that it combines the many different artistic styles of Bowie in one album, rather than being dominated by the influence of only one period of his many-faceted and eclectic career.  For the first time, the various personas Bowie adopted at different points in his career—the extravagant alien rockstar Ziggy Stardust, for example, and the classy but callous and coked-up Thin White Duke—are seemingly brought to life on one album, a truly impressive feat.  “The Stars (Are Out Tonight),” one of the album’s strongest tracks, displays this sort of amalgamation of Bowie’s past styles and themes particularly well. The song combines two of Bowie’s favorite topics—outer space and society’s fascination with fame—in an upbeat, strings-laced track that plays on the notion of stars both as celestial bodies and celebrities.
Thankfully, on “The Next Day,” the now 66-year-old Bowie is not attempting to sound young. He does not stray into the high-pitched yelps that characterize much of his earlier work but remains in his smooth, increasingly frail baritone vocal register. Bowie’s voice is, admittedly, not as strong as it used to be, but his newest album doesn’t suffer for it. In fact, the singer’s weakened voice may paradoxically make “The Next Day” a more powerful album than it would be otherwise. His delicate, almost fragile crooning imparts a sense of vulnerability and elegantly restrained emotion. And, as many of the album’s songs are directed at a younger generation—as evident in Bowie’s thematic fascination with drugs and pop stars—the apparent age in his voice lends some credence to his agile and eccentric lyricism. While many songs directed to a younger audience by similarly aged stars may feel patronizing, Bowie’s music remains—even as he ages—decidedly sympathetic to the plights of youth.
After such a long hiatus from recording, Bowie risked falling into one of two extremes. Either he would fail to significantly innovate his sound and stagnate as an artist or, in an attempt to keep up with changing times, he would alter his sound so extremely that his new music would becomes unrecognizable to his older fans. With this dark and boldly creative album, Bowie seems to have found a stable middle ground by combining his successful past styles with a sense of maturity and self-control in a new, unique sound. This new album is proof positive that the passing years have been more than kind to Bowie—his artistic hand has been steadied by age, but his manic energy has not dimmed.
“The Next Day” certainly feels like a conclusion, one Bowie’s audience never realized it needed until the man himself suddenly announced the album only a few weeks prior to its release. But, like his newest album, David Bowie has always been full of surprises. However unlikely it may seem, there is some slim chance—some faint hope—that “The Next Day” will be not a conclusion, but rather the beginning of a new era.

Celtic music has become a cultural cornerstone in St. Patrick’s Day celebrations. This music will be showcased in Cambridge at the annual St. Patrick’s Day Celtic Sojourn, held on Saturday in Sanders Theatre. The event, presented by WGBH’s Brian O’Donovan, will pull in performers from the Boston area and from the traditional Celtic music community at large. “You’ve got musicians coming from as far as California, and, similarly and equidistant, you have musicians coming from Ireland,” says Eoin McQuinn, a percussionist who will also be performing on the soprano saxophone. McQuinn, an Irish native, has traveled the world sharing his love for traditional Celtic music and says he is excited to see what will be created when such diverse musicians cross paths.
These performers come from different musical backgrounds, each with varying levels of education and experience in traditional Celtic performance. It may seem that bringing together such a diverse group of people would be difficult, but the show encourages spontaneous collaboration. The musicians meet for the first time the day of the show and create the entire program in the hours that precede the performance. “You never know what’s going to happen. In a way it’s sort of like going to a potluck dinner or something like that,” pianist Jacqueline A. Schwab says. “But not your ordinary potluck. Maybe a potluck wedding feast…where somebody’s made their best dish, but you don’t really know what you’re going to get until you get it all together.”
The excitement of collaboratively creating a show based around a mutual love for traditional music appeals to many of the performers. “Brian is amazing at picking some really accomplished musicians, and this kind of gives us an opportunity to play and especially perform together,” says Mariel Vandersteel, who will be playing the hardanger fiddle at this year’s Sojourn.
While the music may be traditional, the musicians appreciate music’s ability to change with each performance. “You can take a song that [has been] in the tradition for 200 years,” McQuinn says. “[But] every individual performance of that piece is different.” The musicians say they are are excited to incorporate traditionally solo instruments into group pieces and very non-Irish instruments into Irish tunes. This year, the St. Patrick’s Day Celtic Sojourn will celebrate the novelty to be found in tradition.

"Where You Are"
Jay Sean, "Neon"
Jay Sean, known for his chart-topping hit “Down,” continues to not innovate with his latest single “Where You Are.” With repetitive lyrics, the standard sugary pop chord progression (see Axis of Awesome’s “4 Chords”), and “woo-hoos” reminiscent of Maroon 5’s “One More Night,” the song has a remarkable tendency to flee one’s memory. This is not to say that Jay Sean doesn’t have another hit on his hands, as the aforementioned traits actually align very well with current Top 40s trends. Maybe his overproduced voice and the word “baby” will put Jay Sean on top again. Hey, it worked once.
"Demon Dance"
Surfer Blood, "Pythons"
The admittedly Weezer-influenced Surfer Blood does indeed sound a bit like Weezer on their latest track “Demon Dance.” Luckily, this turns out to be a good thing. A healthy amount of feedback on the guitars along with lyrics that seamlessly reference both hellhounds and Pentecostalism make for a song that is bizarrely fun.  Though an entire album of songs in this  vein has the potential to become tiresome, the track works amazingly as a single, and the high quality of its composition is matched only by its catchiness.
"Power of a Love Song"
Tate Stevens, "Tate Stevens" 
Winning “The X Factor” means that you have a passable voice and some sort of stage presence. Unfortunately for Mr. Stevens, it doesn’t mean that you will produce quality music—like, at all. Though “Power of a Love Song,” which is a song about songs, may qualify as “meta,” its coolness stops there. Stevens manages to cover most of the clichés of country music in four minutes. With mention of a “first dance,” noticeably accented vocals, and self-obsessed melodrama, this song is one pickup truck short of being a perfect microcosm of a Toby Keith album.

Ever wonder if an amp could go to 11? Find out on Monday when the Coolidge Corner Theatre’s Science on Screen series presents “This Is Spinal Tap,” the classic mockumentary about a fictional British heavy metal band. The film will be paired with a presentation on the science of sound with Christopher A. Shera, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who focuses on hearing and sound.
The “Science on Screen” series started in 2005 as an attempt to bring together science and art in a way that entertains and enlightens. “Our then-associate director, Elizabeth Taylor-Mead, had thought about doing some sort of science-film series, and, serendipitously, we had a long-time member by the name of Richard Anders, and he approached the Coolidge [Corner Theatre] with the idea of doing a series that paired science speakers with movies,” says Cheryl White, director of outreach and publicity at the Coolidge Corner Theatre Foundation. The program has now expanded: the Coolidge Corner Theatre, in conjunction with the nonprofit Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, has awarded grants to 20 independent, nonprofit cinemas all over the country to bring Science on Screen to other communities, with another 20 grants to be awarded late this summer.
Monday’s presentation will follow “This Is Spinal Tap” with a foray into the mechanics of hearing presented by Shera. When he was contacted by the Coolidge Corner Theatre to speak, Shera had never attended a Science on Screen presentation, but soon after went to the Coolidge’s showing of “It Came from Beneath the Sea.” Shera’s particular interests involve understanding the ear’s enormous dynamic range and the mechanisms through which we are able to hear.
He finds the movie fascinating for other reasons as well. “‘This Is Spinal Tap’ is also very interesting from the point of view of its being one of the first mockumentaries, so when you’re watching it you’re never quite really sure what’s true and what’s partially true and what’s completely false,” Shera says. “And actually, that’s sort of a lot like doing science, because when you’re trying to discover new things, you don’t know what’s true and what’s false.”

Mozart’s iconic Requiem in D Minor, written by the composer on his deathbed, has a gentle allure—a restfulness to which the Back Bay Chorale will respond with a collaboration between a 27-year-old rising composer and the Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney. On Sunday in Sanders Theatre, the Chorale will perform Mozart’s Requiem alongside Mohammed Fairouz’s new work “Anything Can Happen.” This will be the Boston premiere of the latter piece, which was co-commissioned by the Chorale and three other chorale groups, among them the Grinnell Singers at Grinnell College, where the piece was performed last year.
“It’s complementary how [Fairouz’s] title says, ‘anything can happen,’ which could be rather daunting,” says Craig Hughes, the president of the Back Bay Chorale. “So our music director, Scott Jarrett, paired it with Mozart Requiem, which is a very comforting piece.”
“Anything Can Happen” contains three poems by Heaney interspersed with Arabic passages chosen by Fairouz, who picked apocalyptic excerpts from the Injeel, the Arabic Christian bible. Fairouz then wrote music around these texts. For the singers, he wrote out Arabic transliteration and an English translation to help their pronunciation and understanding.
The piece also connects time periods. The final movement is a setting of Heaney’s poem “Anything Can Happen,” which is related to September 11. In writing the poem Heaney was inspired by an ancient Roman poet, Horace. “So, it goes back thousands of years, but it is very strangely resonant with the events of 9/11,” Hughes says.
The concert features two soloists. The baritone vocal soloist, David Kravitz, has just premiered in an opera, “Clemency”; the solo violist, Roger Tapping, currently on the faculty of the New England Conservatory, has just been appointed the violist of the Juilliard String Quartet.
Hughes says the piece is meant as a fusion of diverse influences. “You’ve got these cross-cultural elements across West and East, but also music across time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
On Saturday, the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra tackled the latest in a series of ambitious programs, performing Leonard Bernstein’s Overture to “Candide”, as well as “Short Ride in a Fast Machine” by John Adams ’71 and Johannes Brahms’s 4th Symphony. While the consistent brilliance of the HRO’s string section made for an enjoyable, impressive performance,  the brass and wind sections at times failed to match the strings’ dynamic ability and technical precision, holding the orchestra back from its full potential.
The concert began with a near-perfect rendition of Bernstein’s Overture. Through precise control of dynamics, HRO conductor Federico Cortese guided the orchestra’s performance toward a playful mood rather than a bombastic or overwrought one—a decision that made the piece even more enjoyable. The strings effortlessly alternated between soaring crescendos, intricate pizzicato, and, most impressively, the blisteringly rapid unison runs that make up the Overture’s Theme, which are difficult play accurately for even the most experienced performers. Although short and familiar, the Overture is a deceptively difficult piece, and the HRO dazzled through nuanced interpretation and accomplished technical execution.
The second composition on the program, Adams’ “Short Ride in a Fast Machine,” was less successful. A quality performance of the piece depends heavily on the brass section’s ability to build dynamic tension and to articulate rhythmic dissonance through rapid, distinct pulses. However, throughout the majority of the performance, the HRO’s brass was muddled, robbing the piece of its rhythmic tension. In the normally inspiring finale, the brass was simply too soft to rise above the other sections and provide the requisite drama. Adams’ work is challenging to perform, more so than that of his minimalist contemporaries Philip Glass and Steve Reich because it hinges on engrossing the listener with precisely-balanced musical textures.  Although the rendition of the piece was generally good, it was not quite at the level of a professional performance. Compared to the San Francisco Symphony, which is well known for its successful renditions of Adams’ compositions, the HRO’s rendition of the composer’s dramatic style fell short.
While the first two pieces lasted only about eight minutes, the final work, Brahms’ Symphony No. 4 in E minor, lasted over 40. Although technically accomplished, the HRO’s performance lagged in the less riveting and emotionally powerful sections of the Symphony. For example, during the symphony’s least intense movement, the second, the HRO sounded drowsy and disinterested, as if its performers were merely waiting to get to the monumental fourth movement, during which the orchestra regained its energy and delivered a rousing finale. Even within single movements, this problematic trend remained; the loud, dramatic sections were expertly managed, but the performance would have benefited if much more attention had been invested in capturing the emotions found in the softer sections.
The gap in musicianship and technical skill between the strings and the rest of the orchestra persisted throughout the symphony. The strings were mostly excellent throughout, even providing some jaw-dropping moments such as the wonderfully formed interplay between the violins and cellos during the third movement. However, the brass and wind sections were missing the same overall level of precision. At times, their collective timing felt disjointed; at others, their lack of dynamic range contributed to the performance’s drowsy feel.
While the issues with the brass were problematic, they were not fatal to the concert. Rather, they merely kept a very good performance of the symphony from becoming an excellent one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An audience bustles out of a packed theater buzzing with post-show energy. The crowd throws out the typical praises eagerly; “What a great script” or “The actors really got into character” might be heard as the crowd dissipates. It is the world that they have just left, the stage that has been transformed to represent the fantastical details of another reality, that creates the foundation for the script or actors that they compliment. How it is done and who is responsible remains a mystery, though, to many theatergoers.
 
Within the last few decades of theater, the importance of set design has taken on a new meaning, providing the physical backbone for many productions. Evolved dramatically from the bare amphitheaters of the Greeks and the slightly more complex, yet bare stages of the Elizabethan era, modern set design serves to represent the abstract and practical simultaneously in a way that cannot be achieved simply through actors, props, and lighting. Though it might not be the primary focus of a play, set design often provides the thematic backdrop, which serves to accent the actors’ movement and director’s vision.
 
Each placement of a chair and each color of a tile has a purpose; those aesthetic and practical decisions are made by the set designers. Their primary job is to decipher a script to support the director’s idea of how the play should be realized  atmospherically. Working with lighting designers, costume designers, and everyone else involved, set designers consider each aspect of a production’s aesthetic and make sure they come together smoothly. It is these often-unrecognized crew members that work to bring together the production and create a feeling of cohesion: they ultimately serve as the foundation on which the rest of the play is built.
 
DESIGN IN THE DETAILS
 
At its basis, set design creates a sphere in which the story can develop. “A lot of the fun is in the imagining…from taking the story and letting it play out in your mind…envisioning the world and seeing that world come to life,” says Chrissy M. Rodriguez ’15, the set designer for the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of “Utopia, Limited.” In set design, basic details like location, object space, and movement are taken into account. But beyond acting as a physical environment, the set can also serve as reinforcement for a thematic undercurrent present in the script. For the theme of isolation prevalent in HRDC’s “punkplay,” the designers chose to set the action primarily in a three-walled box with only two entrances to provide passage. 
 
What truly allows these elements to form a united mosaic is research. “The other day…I spent three hours in the Fine Arts libraries hanging around the stacks looking at pictures,” Madelynne A. Hays ’13, set designer for HRDC’s recent production “Eurydice,” says.
 
Research can also range from simple things, like looking at other renditions of the show to get a grasp of the mood, to more obscure, detail-oriented exploration like finding different variations and shades of marble flooring, like Rodriguez did for “Utopia, Limited.” After that research, designers might make sketches that eventually make up a basic groundwork, which in turn evolves into a scale model. The process is fluid and the model malleable as the set designer continues changing his or her vision to make it compatible with ideas from directors, actors, and other crewmembers.
 
Such attention to detail is crucial to the believability and validity of a performance. Meant to immerse the audience in the world of the play, set design is responsible for maintaining the fantasy of the production. Small mistakes like a misappropriation of the number of doors or the wrong type of tiling for a historical production can create a disconcerting break.
 
Rodriguez recounts a designer run where the cast of one of the shows in which she was involved performed the show using only the props, set, and direction they had at that moment. “I remember sitting down watching the show…and someone said ‘I’m going to the kitchen’…and they left through the front door,” she says. “From a logical view that doesn’t make any sense. If you’re going through the kitchen you don’t leave the house.” All it takes is a step out of the wrong door to break the illusion of a world for the audience.
 
It’s these small details that complete a performance, especially in adaptations of frequently performed plays such as Shakespeare’s. Many directors choose to modernize plays in an attempt to breathe new life into the script, and in doing so, they can accidentally restrict interpretation with a concept such as placing “Romeo and Juliet” into the context of a modern political conflict. Hays recounts a rendition of “Othello” where “the whole set was…glossy white, there were curtains that were white, and moving platforms” of the same color, which limited the theatergoers’ ability to view the play from their own perspectives. If the performance in question is an adaptation, it seems that the set designer must make the appropriate changes while maintaining the spirit of the original.
 
SPATIALLY CHALLENGED
 
Each stage has its own set of quirks, and it’s the set designers’ responsibility to utilize the space in a way that suits the director’s vision. When a designer decides the placement of objects, he or she must consider fly space—the amount of space above the stage where objects can be flown in via pulleys during the performance. The same sort of judgments must be made to allow for different sight lines, the varying angles an audience will see of the stage, props, and actors depending on where in the theater they are seated. Each aspect affects what audience members can and cannot see, which contributes to the aesthetic and emotional appeal of the play.
 
The stages on campus have different benefits and negatives that set the parameters in which a designer can work. “[The Loeb Ex] is good because of the black box. You can basically do whatever you want,” says Isabel Strauss ’13, a veteran set designer who has been involved with multiple HRDC productions. This could mean a strategy like placing the audience in the middle of the stage, as was done in the HRDC’s production of “Cain and Cain,” or creating a separate stage not entirely dependent on the physical constraints. This is in contrast  to a stage like that of the Agassiz Theatre, which has essentially no fly space, poor sight lines, a balcony, and a “bad grid,” which is located above the stage and hangs lighting instruments.
 
Handling space doesn’t end with the purely technical limitations of the theater, but also involves the position of chairs, platforms, and other physical objects on stage. The Loeb Mainstage presents a particular challenge simply by being massive: the theater can seat up to 540 people.
 
“The Glass Menagerie,” currently being performed by the American Repertory Theater, is staged on this particular set and provides a perfect example of how to utilize the space. On the right side is a leveled fire escape. A red sofa is stationed next to it with a table to the far left, and the backdrop is black. What is remarkable is the way that the empty space is filled and seems interconnected rather than riddled with gaps.
 
“Look at that. What do you see?” asks J. Michael Griggs, both the HRDC advisor and technical director of the Loeb, pointing at the flooring of the stage, which has been transformed into a mirrored surface. “Look at that reflection. The thing about that is, when someone wants a high gloss [surface]…we have to make it out of materials that are in pieces. Somewhere there will be a line or seam,” he says. “For this they wanted a perfect glass-smooth reflection. How do you think they did that?”
 
To achieve this, a pool of glycerin surrounds the main stage, creating a reflecting floor. The result is two stages: the physical one that the audience sees and the reflected one on the liquid. A stage is not always filled so much by placement of many objects, but by the strategic positioning and choices of a select few.
 
COLLABORATIVE CURATION
 
“In modern theater it’s the director’s vision…it’s the director’s medium,” Griggs says. The relationship between director and set designer is a complicated one. While the director holds the basis of the creative focus of the play, the set designer’s role is not simply one of a servant to the director in any successful production. Instead, it is a partnership of equals, the set designer being the translator and interpreter for the director.
 
“It’s definitely a collaboration. I told [the set designer] it has to have a surreal, ‘toon town’ look to it…she’ll come up with a couple of ideas to represent that, and we’ll talk it over,” Susanna B. Wolk ’14 says of the musical she is directing, “Wonderful Town.”
 
The roles in the production are distinct between the director and set designer, but they work in conjunction to create a greater sum than the parts. “The director wants to bring out the story out of the actors and the words,” Griggs says. “The designer…tries to communicate the story through the visuals.” The director is involved in the emotional response, while the other is concerned with the visual.
 
“I think about it as a form of curation. While a curator would pick where to set up…the paintings, the set designer sets up the show, which is the medium,” Hays says.
 
In many ways the physical movement of the actors is dependent on the set. When a director goes through blocking, the process that decides where actors will be when they perform, the location and ability of movement varies greatly depending on how sparse or intricate the set is. A set with levels at different heights that signify multiple locations will pose different challenges than one that is level.
 
Influencing the way the play is acted out, the set designer decides the arrangement of the set, which can continue or stop the momentum of the play. Props, stage entrances, and stage exits change depending on the genre and mood of a production; the designer must use the set and props effectively, without hindering actors’ movements or distracting the audience from the play itself.
 
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
 
“We need more set designers…you can’t put on a show without a set designer,” Strauss says. “There are about five to eight set designers [on campus], but there are 25 shows.” As set designers tend to be overshadowed by the director, Harvard’s pre-professional resources in set design are relatively minimal. Griggs further mentions the lack of set design classes at Harvard—there are currently only two focused distinctly on set design, which Griggs teaches—compared to offerings at schools like Boston University, which has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in scene design. With set design relegated mostly to an extracurricular pursuit at Harvard, in some ways, Griggs says, students are put at a disadvantage when applying to Masters of Fine Arts programs, where set designers learn to hone their craft before setting out in the field. “People coming out of here are at a slight disadvantage,” he says. “Here you have to...do as much work as you can handle on stage, but you don’t get as much of that in-depth skill training.”
 
“Set design has come a long a way since it was first introduced,” Hays says. “New technologies and the rising importance of lighting…. opens up a whole new range of possibilities.” What could be an office or three beige walls can now be something more abstract and interesting. With the rise of the more technical elements, modes of set design other than theater have provided outlets for not just those with MFAs, but also for architects and engineers.
 
The smallest things, like the display in front of a store, to something grander, like the opening ceremony for the Beijing Olympics, would all be considered set design. Stages for performances other than plays also become canvases for set designers, though designers might alter their approach slightly outside the theater. Rodriguez notes the difference between theater and a dance show on which she worked. “There’s not really a physical structure...it means building a large prop,” she says. “Nothing is permanent.”
 
Some popularly televised and viewed events also rely on set design and represent a medium in which set design can evolve. “The Oscars this year were designed by a Broadway set designer, Derek McLane, who is a Harvard grad, so it was very theatrical in its presentation,” Griggs says. In such events, theatrical set design can be brought to a popular audience in an unexpected form. The common thread present between all these different mediums of set design is expressing the creative message.
 
There is one significant caveat that differentiates theater from its peers, however: Rodriguez notes the transportative nature of theatrical set design that is not always a part of other types of performance. “Other shows don’t aim in the same way to transport the audience…to a new world... [or] to tell a story,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the time the importance of returning borrowed Tupperware is discussed for the third time, it’s quite easy to forget that “Dead Man Down” is supposed to be an action thriller. The fact that “Dead” is director Niels Arden Oplev’s first American feature film is no excuse; after all, one would expect the mastermind behind the 2009 Swedish adaptation of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” to be an expert in this genre. However, Oplev is not solely to blame; rather, J.H. Wyman, who also created the recently finished FOX TV series “Fringe,” is at fault for coming up with a script that causes so much eye-rolling that one may wonder if “Dead” is intended to be a comedy.  The action sequences and the screenplay of the film are both lackluster, and the unfortunate combination of the two ultimately weighs down much of the movie, making “Dead” an extremely unpleasant viewing experience.
Despite its moderately intriguing and suspenseful setup, “Dead” struggles with cheesy plot twists and ludicrous dialogue. Victor (Colin Farrell) is a brooding and introverted hitman in the midst of exacting revenge when he is confronted by his neighbor, Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), who harbors a borderline obsessive crush on him. A woman with prominent scars on her face as a result of a drunk-driving accident, Beatrice eventually asks him out on what is unintentionally probably the most listless first date in movie history, filled with lifeless small talk comparable to a conversation in an online speed dating forum. However, the action finally picks up speed as Beatrice unexpectedly blackmails Victor to force him to murder the driver responsible for her agony.
From the very beginning, it seems extremely unlikely that the two will fall in love given the incredibly unromantic setup. The lack of chemistry between Farrell and Rapace also prevents the audience from believing their strained love story. It almost seems like Beatrice’s constant presence in Victor’s life is the sole reason that the moody henchman begins to fall for the very woman that blackmailed him only a couple of days earlier. Compounding this situation is dialogue so awkward that the only reaction it evokes is shuddering. With ridiculous lines like “I’ll just set this between the mustard and the plastic explosives,” spoken by Beatrice to Victor as she adoringly stocks his fridge for him, the preposterous writing makes it hard to take the film seriously.
Despite being highly stylized, the action sequences of “Dead” are as cheesy as the dialogue. Oplev misuses slow motion to create anticlimactic and overwrought shootouts and car chases that are reminiscent of  cartoons. There almost seems to be a correlation in the movie between weapon size and temper: the bigger the gun, the angrier the attacker. In addition, Victor’s apparent invincibility to the bullets of the dozen henchmen he kills pulls the film from realism into fantasy. The unbelievability of the action scenes throughout the movie escalates to the point that by the end, the film seems farcical in its attempt to remain relatable to the audience.
The only thing stopping “Dead” from becoming just another mindless action movie is the strategic casting of Rapace. Having already worked with Rapace in “Dragon Tattoo,” Oplev understandably takes full advantage of this experience and thereby allows Rapace to outshine the rest of her cast by placing few distractions in each of her scenes. Beatrice appears wretched and sympathetic after she returns home from the hospital free of stitches, but full of shame and inner rage. Rapace expertly brings Beatrice to life and effectively conveys her character’s raw pain by portraying her with inward shoulders and fatigued expressions. Her performance is the one redeeming part of an otherwise terrible movie.
While supposedly both an action thriller and a love story, the movie fails to do either genre justice because of a poorly written and confusing script. If only the film focused on just one of these directions, perhaps it could have been an enjoyable experience, especially given the talents of Rapace. Instead, “Dead Man Down” amounts to nothing more than an exercise in vapidity and convolution.

“What  happiness it would be to cry,” Eurydice sighs forlornly, robbed of her  memories after arriving on the shores of Hades. Her character is the  focus of Sarah Ruhl’s modern take on the Greek myth of Orpheus and  Eurydice, which plays at the Loeb Ex through Friday. While Ruhl  transplants the story to modern times, her script preserves the poetic  style of Ovid’s millennia-old version. Such a choice means that from the  mouths of the wrong actors, the play’s lines could come across as  forced and impossibly overwrought. But this production’s cast, deftly  directed by Madeleine F. Bersin ’14, is more than up to the task of  breathing life and emotion into Ruhl’s script, delivering a performance  that is quietly heartrending.
Ruhl’s  retelling of the classic Greek myth places the emphasis not on Orpheus  (Bryan D. Kauder ’14), the famed muse-born musician, but on his wife  (Laura J. A. Trosser ’16). Tempted away from her wedding party by the  Nasty Interesting Man (Alistair A. Debling ’16), Eurydice realizes too  late that he wants to rape her and falls to her death while attempting  to flee. From there, she is transported to the underworld and forced to  shed all memory of her previous life. Her father (Benjamin J. Lorenz  ’14) greets her at the shores of the river Styx and must bear the task  of slowly, painstakingly teaching her to remember. Delivered with  genuine tenderness and infinite patience, Lorenz’s performance provides a  beautiful counterpoint to that of Trosser, whose Eurydice is often  reduced to tears of frustration and confusion as she tries but fails to  reconstruct her past. In one scene, Eurydice comes across a book that  Orpheus sends her; startled, she screams at it before trying to “read”  it with her feet. Yet Trosser’s Eurydice is affecting, not clownish;  Trosser takes on a wide-eyed innocence that makes her character more  sympathetic. Her and Lorenz’s relationship is delicately rendered: in  one of the play’s most touching scenes, Eurydice, gently encouraged by  her father, attempts to read, sheepishly at first, but then gaining  confidence. While the original myth focuses on the relationship between  Eurydice and Orpheus, Ruhl’s version is much more centered around the  father-daughter relationship, and Trosser and Lorenz carry the play with  their poignant portrayals.
As  well as the sustaining power of paternal love, this production of  “Eurydice” also explores romantic attraction. Rather than going for  histrionics, Kauder reads out Orpheus’s letters to his deceased wife  with understated emotion. Kauder’s portrayal of their love is frank but  not overblown, and all the more affecting for it. His love is simple,  natural, yet still acutely felt—he does not have to shout to the heavens  to convey the depth of his grief. And as the ruler of the underworld  (as well as the Nasty Interesting Man), Debling embodies lust. His  obsession with Eurydice is made creepy by his childishness. Wheeling in  on a tricycle, snapping his suspenders emphatically, and prancing around  like an overgrown toddler, Debling skillfully plays up the physical  comedy of his part while still maintaining an air of menace. 
Set  designers Heather D. Mauldin ’14 and Madelynne A. Hays ’13 created a  kind of industrial hellscape: pipes jut up from the ground of an  otherwise desolate set. There are two tiers on top of each other; the  one above represents  the land of the living, while down below is Hades.  Such a division allows for scenes to be enacted on both levels  simultaneously, to great effect. Orpheus and Eurydice’s joyful wedding  dance, for example, is mirrored eerily by the bride’s dead father down  below, who dances all alone. The costuming embodied the essence of each  character: costume designer Allison A. Ray ’14 chose to outfit Trosser  in Mary Janes, ruffled socks, and a bow to play up Eurydice’s childlike  innocence. The ruler of the underworld appears decked out in short  shorts and a striped tank top to exaggerate his off-puttingly juvenile  portrayal. The father’s costuming was fitting as well, and portrayed him  as a mature parental figure—he wore a tweed vest and pants, looking  like he’d stepped out of a sepia-tinged photograph.
Bersin’s  production of “Eurydice” gives viewers a tender and multi-faceted  portrait of love and loss, and though Ruhl’s script focuses on the pain  of losing one’s memories, the cast delivers a performance not to be  forgotten.

“The  Brothers Menaechmi” was the earliest origin of the ripest opportunity  for comedy: doppelgänger mayhem. It details the travails of two  identical persons who are mistaken for one another. Shakespeare  generously retold the story in “The Comedy of Errors,” and even in  dramatic workS such as the movie “The Prestige,” the premise is familiar  and almost now predictable. But in the Harvard Classical Club’s  translation of “Brothers,” which played in the Adams Pool Theatre  through Sunday, the updated script refreshed the oft-used dramatic  scenario. Instead of coming off dry or overdone, the re-translated  script did an excellent job of eliciting laughter, although the updated  jokes and tone did present some structural difficulties. But with few  exceptions, the driving spirit behind the production and a carefully  refined rewrite that allowed the actors to flourish created an  accessible version of the original play.
Separated  after a convoluted series of events explained in the prologue by a  nerdy narrator (director Gus A. Mayopoulus ’15), the twin brothers carve  out a life under the same name in two cities: Epidamnus and Sosicles.  The twin from Epidamnus (Joe B. Lorenz) has become a wealthy merchant  with imperious wife Matrona (Karoline K. Xu ’16), gold-digging mistress  Erotium (Madison M. Dildine ’16), and gluttonous hanger-on Pug, a.k.a.  “The Parasite” (Alexander J. Iascone ’16), in tow. The twin from  Sosicles (Ivo B. Baca ’13) visits Epidamnus with his manservant Messenio  (Todd E. Jones ’16) in search of his lost twin brother and is mistaken  for said brother. Commence the comedy.
The  update of “Menaechmi” drew from internet memes such as the dramatic  chipmunk—one of many examples that play on Plautus’s relatively  transparent fourth wall—as well as fairly brushed over references from  “Holy Musical B@man!” to “Oedipus Rex.” Along with the cultural deluge,  the supporting cast was also given much more room to breathe than in the  original script: Pug carried some textually whiny passages with bombast  and Matrona ended up as a much more sympathetic wife than she appears  in the original play. Messenio, Erotium, and Matrona’s father Senex  (Matt J. Ciommo ’15) all delivered slightly nuanced roles as cunning  slave, crafty courtesan, and crotchety old man; however, most of their  character development came from staging rather than from their lines.  For example, Messenio steps out of the boat during the journey to  Epidamnus to give a monologue and predicts the audience’s thoughts with a  nicely placed “I should probably get back into the boat now,” and  Erotium is heralded with a jazzy sax entrance theme. Even though this is  more attention than the original play gives them, the lesser  characters’ development is used more as a tool to say “This play is  self-aware.” 
Profanity  peppered the characters’ dialogue, and while this could have easily  turned into a series of easy laughs, it was consistent enough to merely  convey the less-elevated feel of the original play. Several other  anachronisms were thrown in, including many hilarious sequences where  Epidamnus’s slaves would trudge across the stage when referred to or the  lovely, unexpected shouts of “Slaves on three... One, two, three,  slaves!” However, the frequent expletives of “By Castor” and “By Pollux”  heavy-handedly induced the same feeling as when you go back to  “Prisoner of Azkaban” and wonder why you ever were surprised that the  character named “Remus Lupin” was a werewolf; the expletives were too  easy and eventually incredibly predictable. Sadly, the constant  curses—whether mythic or merely bleep-able—did also detract slightly  from Sosicles’s actual profanity to Epidamnus’s wife in the original  play: “Do you know why they called Hecuba a bitch?”
The  brothers Menaechmi themselves were responsible for delivering long  lines essentially expressing, “you must be crazy; I did not steal your  dress/eat with you/say that/do that.” However, the deviations from the  script that kept a fast pace through memes, “Family Guy” levels of  references, and a stream of rim-shot worthy cracks, were not kind to the  two main characters. A general recurring “What the hell is going on?”  was added in several times to make sure that the audience felt  comfortable in being a bit confused. The update was definitely right in  taking the risk of branching out and recasting the play in modern humor;  however there was a lot of plot signposting left solely to the two  protagonists. Lorenz as Epidamnus played an enjoyable, starry-eyed,  permissibly over-acted capitalist, and Baca as Sosicles played more of a  straightforward, classically inspired character weirdly reminiscent of  Ben Kenobi, right down to with brushing off characters with index and  middle finger together with almost every line.
With  comic timing, the quick-fire pace and sure blocking allowed the  production to flow freely and transcend its now-clichéd plot. While not a  twin, the update of the original work recreated the levity of a  hilarious misunderstanding while preserving enough of the text to seem  merely referential rather than plagiaristic. If only Shakespeare could  say the same.

Dedicated fans who speak about their favorite artists as though they are on first-name terms; paparazzi shots that circulate daily; concerts that sell out online within minutes—we’ve seen it all before. These aren’t specific to only one country. This is the norm for the U.S., whose “stans” (a portmanteau of the words “stalker” and “fan”) monitor their favorite artists, devotedly engage in conversations with each other through various social media platforms, and even disagree with other stans on fan forums. Within minutes, stans “like” posts on Facebook, “favorite” images on Instagram, and retweet Twitter posts left by their idols. To an outsider, it borders on obsessive—reminiscent of I Saw You Harvard but lacking the humor and oozing pure creepiness. However, most artists seem to have embraced their fan clubs, even appointing them with endearing names. Nicki Minaj refers to her fans as “Barbs” and “Ken Barbs,” while Justin Bieber has taken to calling his cohort of followers his “Beliebers.”
To a certain extent, it’s a symbiotic relationship between the artist and the fandom. Even if an artist desires to create music for the sake of creating something beautiful, without the fans, the artist essentially lacks an audience. Without the consumption of products, there is no funding for the future opportunities to continue producing work. A good artist deserves a respectful fan following so that he or she can gain recognition. But is there a breaking point when fandom edges on insane?
The U.S. has witnessed its share of fans-gone-obsessive, including occasional celebrity stalking cases. However, in the U.S., even the most devoted fans don’t physically interfere with artists’ lives (except for the occasional crazy fan who might make a tabloid headline for trying to steal Britney Spears’ wig). In contrast, there is an entire breed of K-pop fans who have taken fandom to an alarming level.
There are numerous instances of intense fans hiding outside artists’ homes for hours, sometimes even breaking into homes; acquiring and selling telephone numbers, private photos, and identification numbers of celebrities; hiring taxis at exorbitant rates of $300-$500 a day to stalk the vehicles transporting artists; even lying together in streets and blocking traffic until they are able to see their idols. These fans are called “sasaeng fans” (where “sa” means private and “saeng” means life), aptly named because they literally interfere with idols’ lives to the point that some artists are driven insane, or come close to death.
Take, for instance, Yunho of popular group TXVQ, who had to be rushed to the hospital when a crazed fan snuck in backstage and poisoned his beverage with toxic glue, or actor Jang Geun Seuk, whose car was rigged with a GPS tracking device so that sasaeng fans could follow him at any given point of the day. When boy group EXO-K recently arrived at Incheon International Airport enroute to an international awards show, fans descended upon them like a swarm of locusts; videos uploaded to YouTube reveal members of EXO-K being cursed for trying to avoid the flashing glare of fangirls’ cameras.
Stalking and photographing of artists does happen in the States as well, but these behaviors are motivated mostly by commercial ventures— the better the photo, the higher the price of the photo for the tabloids. It’s pure business. Yet with sasaeng fans, there seems to be no ulterior motive or goal behind the crazy actions. The frightening devotion-turned-obsession with their idols is an end in itself. Unlike paparazzi, these fans only desire to get as close to their idols as possible. It’s a paradoxical situation—these fans love the celebrity, but they cause harm and sometimes even psychological terror because they seem to desire complete ownership of their idol.
People have tried to explain away this frightening phenomenon as a difference in cultures between the East and the West. But this explanation not only unfairly generalizes a rich wealth of cultures in the Eastern hemisphere; it is also simply unfounded. The influx of foreign sasaeng fans who visit Korea from other countries to stalk their artists; the instances of K-pop idols being followed and stalked within hotels at concert locations even outside of Seoul; the burgeoning number of foreign fan forums where personal information and sightings of celebrities are shared, and the growing demand for these international concerts all prove otherwise. There is no one definition for who fits the bill of a sasaeng fan.
Of course, not all fans exhibit these terrifying qualities. Fans also engage in community service in their favorite celebrity’s name, even donating tons of rice to hungry communities or thousands of dollars to humanitarian causes. Fans work hard to send homemade meals to feed the entire set and crew of the television program or film shoot in which their favorite celebrities participate. They even band together in guerilla advertising movements to make their favorite celebrities become globally trending topics on Twitter. However, it’s undeniable that the sasaeng fan phenomenon in the world of K-pop seems to not only trample the fine line between devoted loyalty and obsession, but also brings to question who could actually be held responsible for fandom that may have gone “too far.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I love you. I can see myself in your eyes, and it’s not just the reflection of my white face in your black pupils. Simple as that. Not many things are, but this is black and white.
We loved each other for a whole night, didn’t we? Well, I guess it wasn’t really even the night, was it? A morning, and only part of one, but the best part—the between- midnight-and-getting-out-of-bed part, the things that happen in the dark-fades-to-light hours.
I loved you the first time we spoke. It was at your party during that black night in your gray apartment on your white couch in my black-and-white dress when I wanted nothing more than to lie in your white room on your white bed and stare at the white ceiling and make gray clouds and think black thoughts with you.
We were drunk at the bar on that night we loved and I don’t quite know how we left together, but we did and proceeded to blacken our lungs outside under gray clouds. I opened your door easily, the one where the key sticks, a little trick of mine from a door I’d once known. You smiled as I entered your world. You  showed me your drawings, excited to share, but I remembered them all from before—the wrinkly man and the vase face and the boring fashion model you’d said you could draw in your sleep. I asked you about your writing that you’d told me about before but that you didn’t remember telling me about, because you don’t tell people those things. You blushed in surprise and it was sweet, like I thought your lips might be.
I don’t know how it came to be that we kissed, but I wish that I did because it was lovely and I loved you there again on your couch. And I don’t know how we got to your bedroom, but I do remember being there and  you went down on me and I went up on you and we moved together like we were on the sea and it was perfect and I could have had sex with you forever.
We had cigarettes and music on your white couch in our black scraps of clothing and we kept not sleeping even though we should have. We got to bed eventually, holding each other strangely close in the black night. I saw you that night and I saw you again in the morning as I woke and rolled over to stare at your white ceiling from your white sheets and you pulled me back over in your half-sleep, which I enjoyed more than most things. I loved you then as I ran my hand through your black hair, listening to your heart beat. I told you I’d drawn you in a dream, the sharp lines of your face that highlight your mouth, I said how it was perfect and you said that I was.
You are perfect in my head, where I can change the way things are to a certain this or that. I’ve loved you as the dream more than you as the man, the real man with undefinable shades of color. Life and having lived turns black and white to gray, but my heart and mind’s ache for absolutes has power over memory. Desire writes his name boldly over history. My romanticizing urge makes love out of lust, and it tells me this is true:
I loved you then and now, and it is as simple as black and white.

For writers at work, punctuation can slip from a matter of convention to one of obsession. I just finished my poetry thesis last week, and I’m embarrassed to admit the number of times I changed periods to commas, replaced colons with dashes, and struck out semicolons—only to routinely second-guess my revisions. An ill-placed period felt as dangerous as stopping the car on the highway, while a missing colon felt like pummeling through a scenic pass without the requisite anticipatory pause.
The comparison of a speck of ink to the brakes on a 4,000 pound vehicle might sound extreme, but my devotion to punctuation is hardly radical on the spectrum. Hungarian novelist Péter Nádas, a far more esteemed (if less jovial) grammarian than myself, once grew so distressed about the authenticity of his punctuation that he claimed to want to die. His contemporary author László Krasznahorkai professed to avoiding periods because “periods are for God.” In my favorite authorial statement on punctuation, German theorist Theodore Adorno stares into these small black dots and sees history flicker: “It is history, far more than meaning for grammatical function, that looks out at us, rigidified and trembling slightly, from every mark of punctuation,” he writes.
These writers’ fervor for punctuation led me to wonder about the story of our symbols. Where were these tiny markings born? How did they crawl into the spaces between words on pages worldwide? My quest for answers (a journey that led me from the front to back of M.B. Parkes’ “Pause and Effect: An Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West”) yielded an explanation that reached into antiquity, matured in the Middle Ages, and solidified with the status of the printing press.
The astonishing truth is that punctuation is not as old as the written word. In classical times, the oral literary tradition sidestepped the need for punctuation. Authors wrote according to the Greek method of “scriptio continua” (continuous text), and orators gleaned the topography of finished writing through preparatory readings that revealed pauses and pronunciations. Texts were meant to be delivered aloud, and sight-reading was uncommon practice. At most, scribes would insert indentations or differentiate first letters of new paragraphs; teachers known as “Grammatici” might incorporate hyphens or long-vowel marks while assisting their pupils. Romans dabbled with periods in the first century, but even they soon reverted back to “scriptio continua”, relying on Latin syntax alone to imply questions and quotations.
With the rise of Christianity, punctuation took on new life. Monasteries housed monks who began to read for the purpose of individual education rather than rhetorical performance. Silent reading became more popular, and punctuation grew significant for shedding light on the meaning of religious texts. In the sixth century, Archbishop Isidore of Seville even wrote a guide ranking punctuation symbols in order of importance. By the time Anglo-Saxon scribes started recording Latin texts in the eighth century, punctuation marks were cropping up in texts with regularity. An ivy leaf was used to separate text from commentary, a mark called the “diple” (>) indicated quotations, and scores shaped like “7” functioned as commas.
The advent of the printing press in the 15th century set punctuation on a path to uniformity. New Roman became the default typeface, and with it the comma, parentheses, and semi-colon rose to prominence. As printers tried to fit text into specific page dimensions, punctuation marks like the apostrophe were introduced for abbreviation. These new conventions spread as swiftly as the printed books they populated.The significance of each mark congealed into its set meaning, and writers could start to manipulate punctuation as craftwork. Authors began using punctuation not only to add grammatical clarity, but to shape their arguments and characterize their style. The nuances that punctuation captured gave way to the beautiful 17th-century idea that punctuation, as much as language, mirrors the structure of thought—hence the doggedness we see in contemporary writers shaping their sentences.
It seems easy to dismiss writers’ obsessions with punctuation as a retreat from reality. In the physical world, what matters about one minuscule pen mark on a paper sheet? My conceit, based on months of crafting my poetry thesis and a few hours researching punctuation history, is that this minuscule pen mark does matter. Punctuation brings writers one step closer to representing reality in all the detail they perceive. Periods, commas, and colons are the fine-edged tools writers need to contour the voice they want the world to hear. When we treat writing not only as a structure of pages, paragraphs, sentences, and words, but also as a patchwork of punctuation marks, reality can celebrate for having another level of gradation revealed through language.

Rock guitarists have all the fun. They get to stand at the front of the stage with the lead singer and play flashy solos—which are run through about eight different electronic filters)—and bask in the light of their fans’ adoration. Drummers and bass players, on the other hand, have to stand in the background and look mournfully out to the crowd, hoping that some girl might look past the frontman’s unbridled machismo and notice the sensitive soul laying down beats toward the back.
This wasn’t always the case. Back in the heady days of soul music, while the lead singers were busting out some fly, synchronized dance in the front, the guitarist and the bassist were standing together. Bassists, drummers, and guitarists were equals, all working together to lay down the foundation of the song. Guitarists didn’t get solos. Like all the other musicians, they would get a “break”—a couple of measures—in the song to do their thing before melting back into the rest of the band.
This is what makes Eddie Floyd’s “Big Bird” so unusual. It is above all else a guitar song, driven by the sort of guitar licks and chord progressions usually found in rock ‘n’ roll. The guitar plays exposed riffs a total of four times throughout the track, and the horns—which have most of the best solos in the soul catalog—actually let the guitars have all the limelight on “Big Bird,” acting for the most part to support the other instruments in the rhythm section. It is the guitarist’s big moment, and even for a musician as accomplished as Booker T. Jones—of Booker T. and the M.G.’s’ fame—the recognition must have been nice.
Before I continue, I have to own up to a couple of things. First of all, unlike the other songs I’ve written about in this column, “Big Bird” was actually released as a single—by Stax Records in 1967—even if it was a commercial flop. Also, this song wasn’t cruelly underappreciated. In fact, it has been covered by numerous artists, including seminal English punk rockers The Jam, and has enjoyed a cult following in the UK. The reason this song is worth discussing is because it marks a watershed moment in the history of soul music. Soul music—especially in the early to mid ‘60s—often fell victim to appropriation by white artists like Pat Boone, who scored hits by covering the work of black artists. Even artists like The Beatles did the same thing, even though, to their credit, they took the time to acknowledge the genius of the artists they were covering.
Soul music tends to be a little formulaic, but this song draws very heavily from the guitar-driven rock that was flooding the airwaves in the late ‘60s. However, what is so interesting about a song like “Big Bird” is how syncretic it is. “Big Bird” is still definitely a soul song, but one that is actually in conversation with music by the likes of the Kinks and the Dave Clark Five. In fact, it was written by Floyd in London—incidentally while he waiting in an airport to fly back to the states for Otis Redding’s funeral—the home of blues-infused rock music pioneered by artists such as the Rolling Stones.
It starts with a meandering, sliding guitar riff, quickly doubled by the rhythm guitarist. Soon, the drums and saxes come in and kick the song up to a whole other level of intensity. Just as suddenly as they emerged, they fall back and let Booker Washington set the tone for the verse with a bluesy chord progression that sounds like it came straight from a Howlin’ Wolf classic. “Big Bird” has all the bells and whistles normally associated with soul music—such as punchy sax solos and call-and-response vocal harmonies—but unlike most of Floyd’s other works, the engine of the song is the omnipresent guitar, which drives the song along in a distinctly rock ‘n’ roll way.
One of the hardest things for any artist to do is to mesh two different styles without compromising the integrity of either one. “Big Bird” is an example of precisely how this should be done. It is full of rock elements, but never once sounds like anything but a soul song. It captures both rock’s hard edge and soul’s lushness. And for once, Booker T. Washington got to share the spotlight with the lead singer and play a soul song that is actually worthy of a guitarist of his abilities. His mother must have been proud.

Poetry is often thought of as a textual artform, but it can also be a social experience. On Saturday, the artist and poet Jon Cotner, who is also a lecturer at the Pratt Institute, visited Harvard Square to lead a walk entitled “Spontaneous Society.” The walk was sponsored by the Woodberry Poetry Room at Harvard.
 Cotner, who is the author of “Ten Walks/Two Talks,”  a collection of dialogues and poems about walks in Manhattan, introduced the walk as an artistic piece and a personal journey for the individual walkers. According to Cotner, speech has an intense power to spread joy and to forge connections. A major theme of Cotner’s published work is the issue of humans becoming isolated units obsessed with controlling their environments, whether it be through their constant iPod soundtrack or other incessant digital engagement instead of physically social interaction. 
According to Cotner, the goal of the walk was to intervene and create a smile or a laugh and to amplify good vibes between the walkers and everyone with whom they came into contact. When people ignore the stimuli in their environment, they ignore the possibility of spontaneity, Cotner said. 
Cotner used a variety of tactics to encourage participants to change their perceptions of their environment. He began by suggesting that the walkers stretch their bodies to activate themselves in the space and the moment. The group stretched in front of Harvard Hall amidst the comers and goers in Harvard Yard. This exercise was intended to make the strangers feel more relaxed in each other’s company, Cotner said.
To demonstrate the power of spontaneous interaction, he asked the participants to share a story about chance interactions with strangers, and each member of the group shared one such experience.  As the walk began, Cotner assigned each person lines to try out in various scenarios. Oliver D. Strand ’11, one of the participants on the walk, was to say to anyone carrying food, despite the pervasive chill in the air, “It’s a great day for a picnic!” If someone approached with a baby in a stroller, another participant was instructed to say to them, “That looks cozy!” If someone approached with two dogs, the response was to be “That’s a good-looking duo!” More dogs prompted “That’s a good-looking wolfpack!” This line was deployed to a homeless man who sat with his three furry companions.  While this was happening, a woman brought him a bag of food and wished him well. Cotner said that these lines were all intended to connect the person speaking them to his or her surroundings , to make them pause and acknowledge a fleeting moment in our fast-paced world.
During the 90-minute walk, the participants became progressively more successful at engaging with the people they encounter. Many things from their trials and errors at penetrating the fortresses of anonymity on the street. When trying to connect with other people, eye contact is critical, one of the participants observed. When breaking through a social wall by offering a line, one really must mean it—people can sense sincerity. In scanning the sidewalks and horizons for targets to deliver the lines to, the walkers were encouraged to truly pay attention to their presence in a social space. “You created smiles that didn’t exist before,” Cotner told the participants.
 Some of the participants mentioned that it was strange that while the goal was spontaneity, parts of the piece were ironically unspontaneous—the planned lines, scenarios, and its very status as a piece of art at all. Cotner explained that his method paved the way for true spontaneity as the walkers learned to slow down and appreciate the ease with which they could generate happiness. Though Cotner’s walks aim to blur the line between art and life, the lines he gave out were not particularly beautiful. However, they were very poetic in sentiment. According to Cotner, their sole purpose was to use an ephemeral moment to bring about a smile.
“That’s a good spot for a text!” he said brightly to a woman fiddling with her phone on a street corner. “You nailed it!” She looked up, confused, and then she smiled and agreed. “Over the years I’ve developed a catalog of one-line utterances that are 99% effective in terms of replacing urban anonymity with affection,” Cotner said.
 “[This is like] sharing a D.I.Y. joy kit,”  Cotner said. After pausing to reflect on the experience of the walk, the participants, who were formerly strangers, parted with hugs.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 18, 2013
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the “Spontaneous Society” walk in Harvard Square was co-sponsored by Elastic City, an organization that commissions artists to create walks. In fact, Elastic City was not involved in the “Spontaneous Society” walk.

Support for the State of Israel, once a matter of consensus among American Jews, is now the most divisive issue in the Jewish community. The weakening of support for Israel among many young American Jews is real and significant, while the reasons for this trend are complex and multifaceted.
I’m not talking about unaffiliated Jews; they are distancing from Judaism in general, and their disengagement from Israel is merely a symptom of this larger phenomenon. Nor am I focused on the Orthodox community, where staunch support for the Jewish state remains the norm.
However a growing number of socially and politically progressive Jews are becoming increasingly critical of Israel’s rightward shift. They feel that their commitment to Israel compels them to speak out against continued occupation and settlement growth, policies that they see as morally indefensible and that only serve to undermine Israel’s own strategic goals. Their support for Israel is inextricably tied to the pursuit of peace; for them, the need for a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and secure Israel’s future as a Jewish state is axiomatic.
A new generation of Jews needs a new paradigm for supporting Israel: their advocacy is not only about defending Israel on campus, but also about challenging the status quo and working to make Israel a better, more perfect country. Young American Jews are grappling with difficult questions about Israel’s status as a Jewish and democratic state, Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians, and Israel’s state monopoly of religion, to name just a few. The one-dimensional pictures of Israel painted by advocacy organizations or the honeymoon experience of a ten-day Birthright trip are no longer sufficient to help students wrestle with the multilayered, chaotic montage of life in Israel today.
The Jewish community should be engaging with this demographic—young Jews trying to make sense of their identities in the face of a complex reality in Israel—rather than pushing them away. We must foster an open environment that will encourage them to build more sophisticated and authentic relationships with Israel, teaching them to embrace Israel despite its imperfections.
Sadly, the mainstream Jewish community’s hypersensitivity towards efforts to delegitimize Israel is often extended to liberal Jewish groups (e.g. J Street). At Harvard, the Open Hillel Campaign, a student-led initiative aiming to expand Hillel International’s guidelines on discussions about Israel, has been at the center of recent clashes between the Progressive Jewish Alliance and the Jewish community. There is always a double standard in the Jewish community when it comes to criticism of Israel: To criticize from the right is legitimate, but to criticize from the left is to stab Israel in the back. This is hypocritical and wrong. Most criticism of Israel—not all, but most—comes from a place of deep love and commitment. Just because left-leaning Jews are critical of the occupation does not mean that they’re anti-Israel; rather their critical engagement is an expression of commitment to securing Israel’s identity and future.
That said, progressive Jews must also do more to mitigate the often-legitimate concerns of the Jewish community. They shouldn’t expect moral exceptionalism from Israelis in dealing with the realpolitik demands of sovereignty. Nor should they dismiss or legitimize efforts to undermine the moral and political foundations of the State of Israel (as opposed to the occupation). The rejectionist and zero-sum ethos of anti-Israel activists presents a significant threat not only to Israel’s future but to the viability of peace in the region as well. We need not look further than tactics like Israel Apartheid Week or campaigns to boycott Israel to see the destructiveness of activism focused more on demonizing the Other than on resolving the conflict.
Nevertheless, stifling debate about Israel—no matter how prejudiced or uninformed—or marginalizing liberal Jewish voices is wrong and ultimately self-defeating. The Jewish community shouldn’t be afraid to engage in difficult conversations about Israel. Ideas should be tested in the open marketplace through rigorous intellectual debate and civil dialogue; that is the only effective way to discredit bad ideas and amplify good ones.
To that end, the Jewish community should be just as invested in helping young Jews cultivate meaningful relationships with Israel as it is in defending the Jewish state. For a state will only endure—it will only remain relevant to Israelis and Jews around the world—if it can be defended not only militarily but also morally. Indeed, there is no inherent contradiction between the responsibility to defend Israel and the imperative to perfect it; the two are reciprocally linked: Defending the state is a necessary condition for perfecting it, just as a more perfect Israel will be easier to defend.
If the American Jewish community does not promote a more nuanced and sophisticated conversation about Israel, if it does not actively change the way Israel is discussed on campuses and in communities, it risks alienating a growing number of young Jews. Make no mistake: The future of the Jewish community and the State of Israel depends upon securing the continued support of liberal and open-minded Jews.

As I sat in the audience of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s Policy Conference two weekends ago, I could have sworn I was at a Megillah service. People were making a lot of noise and railing against a Persian leader who wanted to annihilate the Jews.
The Islamic Republic claims it wants nuclear capacity for peaceful purposes. That’s a highly dubious proposition. But so is the notion that Iran would drop an atomic bomb on Tel Aviv. Even if President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a modern-day Haman, he lacks the power to realize his vision. Like all Iranian presidents, he is a glorified functionary, with real authority invested in Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Despite essentialist, facile chatter about the mullahs' “culture of death,” Khamenei is a realist. He knows Iran will be “obliterated” if it perpetrates a second Holocaust. Instead, the Islamic Republic seeks to challenge Israel’s military superiority and counterbalance the American-Saudi axis. Those aims menace the geopolitical interests of the U.S. and the Jewish state, and the two countries have responded with appropriate and devastatingly effective sabotage campaigns.
Israel has long pondered a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, and tried to enlist American backing during the Bush years. There are good reasons to oppose such an action—many Israelis, including President Shimon Peres, are against it. If the program were not destroyed, it might resume further underground. Even worse, an attack could also be the reveille of regional war.
If I dispute AIPAC’s analysis of the Iran affair, I also take issue with the false narrative of Jewish powerlessness to which such a focus contributes. At the conference’s plenaries, almost every speaker invoked the Holocaust, as if to link the Shoah and the present moment. AIPAC President Michael Kassen spoke of “danger,” “threats,” and “turmoil” facing Israel, the word “extermination” hanging in the air. Even the aesthetics made one feel small and impotent, incongruous with an event widely seen as a showcase of the Jewish community’s "power."
What was conspicuously absent from Kassen’s address—he mentioned Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and yes, Iran—was any discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indeed, throughout the confab, there was spare reference made to the occupation or the peace process. Most speeches evinced general support for Israel yet did not detail who that support was directed against. The emphasis on issues of victimhood rather than agency was deliberate, for agency implies responsibility, and responsibility points to Israel’s untenable occupation of the West Bank.[NM1]
AIPAC’s political theater contrasted starkly with what I saw in the movie theaters upon my return to Cambridge. The first film was “The Gatekeepers,” an examination of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank through the lens of six former heads of the Jewish state’s internal security service, the Shin Bet. In frank interviews, the ex-chiefs admit to ordering extralegal killings, overseeing torture of prisoners, and carrying out policies that made Palestinian life miserable
The second was “5 Broken Cameras,” screened by the Palestine Solidarity Committee as part of “Israeli Apartheid” Week. (I think the apartheid label is a canard, but Joshua B. Lipson and Ariel Rubin and Ariella Rotenberg have already done the yeoman’s work of explaining why that is.) Filmed by Palestinian farmer Emad Burnat, the documentary chronicles the construction of the West Bank separation barrier, which threatens to cut off the townspeople of Bil’in from their farmland.  In response, the villagers stage non-violent protests against the wall, and through their campaign and Burnat’s camera we catch glimpses of Israel’s darker side—reckless, overly aggressive soldiers; violent, vandalizing settlers; occupation-traumatized children.
Coming from different sides of the fence, “The Gatekeepers” and “5 Broken Cameras” happen upon the same message. That guns and walls are no substitute for a comprehensive West Bank policy and peace process. And that the occupation hurts everyone it touches, denying Palestinians basic rights like freedom of movement and imperiling Israel’s status as a Jewish democracy.
AIPAC and the Israeli government have direct agency in this matter. Unfortunately, they have missed the most important part of the Purim story: Esther’s courage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late last week, as a rare March blizzard began to take our nation’s capital by storm, an ophthalmologist from Kentucky directed all eyes to C-Span, where he was busy making history. The ophthalmologist, Senator Rand Paul, managed to remain standing for nearly 13 hours in protest over President Obama’s choice to head the CIA in his second administration. While Paul admitted the inevitable futility of the filibuster, he remained firm in his positing of a single, previously unanswered question: “Does the President have the authority to use a drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?” We commend the senator for raising the alarm on this important aspect of civil liberty, and we fault the administration for its intransigence in clarifying its own policies.
While John O. Brennan faced little trouble in his confirmation as Director of the CIA the day after Paul’s showmanship, Senator Paul did ultimately score a victory for his cause. Throughout his marathon of a speech, Paul read passages from previous letters sent to him by the attorney general addressing his primary query. The cavalier and wholly unsatisfying answer was, namely, that the question is laughable in and of itself—the president has never had to ponder targeting an American on U.S. soil. Laudably, Paul was unhappy with this response and stood his ground until he could get an unambiguous “yes” or “no” from the Justice Department. While he ultimately capitulated before such a memorandum arrived, the next day Attorney General Eric Holder backtracked from his previous position that American citizens at home could be targeted in “extraordinary circumstances.” His new, clarified stance is that “the answer to [Senator Paul’s] question is no.”
This is a victory not only for the senator from Kentucky’s political ambitions, but also for the good of the American people at large. The Obama administration has been dangerously continuing the unsalutary covertness of the Bush era national security team, which initiated the drone program a decade ago. Last year’s revelation that the president makes the final and unchecked decision on targeting members of his secret “kill list” calls into question how seriously our nation’s leaders take the Fifth Amendment. While the Bush years yielded many vociferous activists opposed to warrant-less wiretapping and other iniquities, the Obama administration has yet to face the same critics (largely because they make up a component of his political base). We take pride in Senator Paul’s championing of the causes of civil liberties and government accountability, and we call on more of our nation’s leaders to join him on this issue. As Democratic Senator Ron Wyden proved during the epic filibuster, seeking clarity on life-or-death policy should not manifest into a partisan issue.
Patrick Henry once said, “The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.” Before Senator Paul’s bit of political theatre, it was not just the transactions of our rulers but also the possible scope of such transactions that had been blatantly concealed. Such is not the mark of good governance. While we are glad that Paul’s question has finally been granted a serious reply, we urge the administration to remember this moment in future situations. Likewise, we call on all of our nation’s leaders to be as brave as Senator Paul. When the government shrouds the nature of its business, it is up to political figures to call for transparency and openness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Senate voted to confirm John O. Brennan, Obama's former counterterrorism adviser, as the director of the CIA by a 63 to 34 vote, despite a lengthy public filibuster by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. This confirmation, along with the recent leak of a white paper detailing a legal framework for drone strikes and Attorney General Eric Holder's admission that it might be acceptable to kill Americans in exigent circumstances, has ignited a public debate on what standards U.S. officials ought to hold themselves to as they wage a covert drone war throughout the world. Proposals to outline a legal framework for the drone program presuppose a basic level of honesty, competency, and care our government has time and time again proven itself incapable of maintaining.
In 2011, Brennan made the claim that U.S. drones had caused “no civilian deaths to date.” At the time that Brennan made this statement, drones had killed at least 500 civilians, with the Obama administration's knowledge of at least several of those deaths well documented.
In 2012, the Obama administration let it be known that each drone strike has to be personally approved by the president after a roundtable discussion of the target’s biography and level of guilt. At this point, the U.S. had already been actively pursuing a strategy of signature strikes, in which groups of nameless individuals are targeted based on “suspicious behavior.” The CIA had been allowed to carry out its own strikes absent the president's involvement.
It is naïve to believe that a few more rules for the administration would be at all effective; the administration has proven more than willing to deceive and mislead the American public about its actions. The drone program has been devastating to the nations it is carried out in and harmful to American interests. Defenses made by top officials signal an execution strategy so covert that it inhibits the basic level of accountability the program desperately needs.
The U.S. drone program has constituted a reign of terror over Waziristan (as well as in Yemen and Somalia). The administration has made use of second strikes, attacks carried out shortly after an initial hit, which kill medical personnel. It has also targeted funerals and other innocuous gatherings The agreements of the Geneva Convention explicitly ban such strikes. The threat of drones has made people unwilling to gather outside, perform their cultural rites such as funerals or weddings, leave their homes to go to school, or even provide medical assistance to the injured. Not only has America killed civilians, but it has also recast life in the areas it targets as a one in constant danger and fear.
These sorts of harms are unacceptable, and they are ones the America government is unwilling to admit exist. In fact, in light of a recent revision of the definition of militant to be more inclusive, the American government no longer even keeps track of the number of civilians it kills. Furthermore, because people in these regions are often illiterate and isolated, and because the Pakistani government does not grant access to outside reporters, it is difficult for us to hold our leaders accountable.
Meanwhile, the drone program has systematically turned the opinion of peoples in these regions against us. Before drone strikes were carried out in their country, Pakistanis generally had a favorable or neutral opinion of the US. According to a Pew study, now 74 percent of them view the US as an enemy and 97 percent of those familiar with the drone program in Pakistan believe it is a bad policy. The idea that Pakistanis are grateful for the intervention is a myth. Moreover, al-Qaeda's structure makes it unlikely these attacks will ever deal crippling damage. America can boast that it has killed al-Qaeda's number two multiple times due to the organization’s decentralized structure; top figures are quickly and easily replaced. Most of the militants killed are foot soldiers, as only two percent of strikes hit targets deemed to be of “high value.” It is unclear how this harms al-Qaeda’s ability to attack America, especially when the primary effect of the drone program seems to be to have caused the group to move elsewhere and resume operations.
The United States has been carrying out a program that devastates innocent lives and harms American interests without admitting to it, choosing instead to actively lie about it for some time. It can no longer be allowed to appeal to an ambiguous and unproven need for secrecy in order to justify escaping unexamined and unchallenged. If it is, abuses will continue and American interests will not be served. Despite the current controversy, the administration has already resumed its drone strikes, killing two "suspected militants" in Pakistan last Sunday. Its next strike may kill militants, children on their way to school, or farmers heading home—we will never know. The Obama administration wants to continue its brutal business as usual. We can’t let it.

Millions of Americans hear her voice on the radio each week, but members of the Harvard community had a chance to see National Public Radio reporter and “All Things Considered” host Melissa J. Block ’83 speak in person on Monday afternoon.
Block, who has co-hosted the daily news program since 2003, delivered a lecture at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study titled “‘All Things Considered’ Considered.” During the talk, Block reflected on her career in journalism and the changes facing the industry as it becomes increasingly digital.
In an interview before the talk, Block told The Crimson she hoped she would teach her audience more about the radio industry.
“[I hope they] stop and think about what makes radio special, to some extent,” Block said. “It’s something I’ve devoted my entire working life to and am very protective of and passionate about.”
Block encorporated several audio clips into her talk. Block gave the audience a glimpse into a day in the life of the production team of “All Things Considered,” as well as several clips from past reports. One clip featured Block interviewing a family that had been searching for their son soon after the May 2008 earthquake that hit Chengdu, China. Block said the clip served as an example of “intimate storytelling,” something Block said NPR especially values.
“We really like to let our best stories breathe,” Block said. “Even as our attention spans shrink and our thoughts are boiled down into 140-character tweets, we [still believe we can] keep our listener hooked and actively engaged with dynamic storytelling.”
Block also discussed the rise of the competitive media culture, in which news outlets race to report breaking news first. She emphasized the importance of careful and accurate reporting despite the competition.
Harold N. Eyster ’16 said he appreciated the opportunity to hear Block’s take on the news industry.
“I’ve always listened to Melissa Block on the radio and thought it would be great to see her in person and hear her reflections on her role in radio,” he said.

I. Glenn Cohen will ascend in the ranks of Harvard Law School’s faculty this summer as its newest tenured professor, bringing with him expertise on the legal aspects of healthcare and bioethics.
“I’m excited, honored, and happy to be here for the foreseeable future,” said Cohen, who became an assistant professor at HLS in 2008 and co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics in 2009.
“He’s an amazing professor,” said Benjamin N. Roin, assistant professor at HLS, who works with Cohen as the other co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center. “You go to the classroom and see that he’s really dynamic. I think he’s a great teacher who loves his students.”
Cohen said that he looks forward to “more book writing, more book editing, and maybe down the road, a new course” in his new position. He has been in discussions about a potential healthcare law course that would be a collaboration between the Law School, Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School. The class is still in a developmental stage.
In the meantime, Cohen expects his course load to remain about the same, and he anticipates teaching courses in bioethics and health law, including one that discusses the intersection of bioethics and film. Furthermore, he will continue in his position as co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center.
“He’s such a fascinating scholar,” Roin said. “He’s really interested in the puzzling questions surrounding health, law, and medicine. His medical ethics class is always over-enrolled.”
Cohen’s main research interests lie in the fields of reproductive technology, medical tourism, and issues common to both doctors and lawyers. Cohen was chosen as a Radcliffe Institute Fellow this year with a focus on medical tourism.
“There are so many interesting things going on with health reform and the healthcare debate,” he said. “It’s very current, which I like.”
Amidst growing concern among Law School students over employment after graduation, Cohen said that bioethics and the legal aspect of healthcare have strong growth prospects.
“The Affordable Care Act is a great insurance opportunity for lawyers,” he said. “The law school, I think, ultimately does hope to bring in more healthcare faculty members.”
Roin said that given the large role of the healthcare industry in the U.S. economy, this growth in health law was “inevitable.”
“The healthcare system interacts with the legal system in a whole bunch of different ways,” he said. “You can’t get away from it anymore.”

Retired General Stanley A. McChrystal called upon Harvard students to serve their country on Monday night as part of a panel hosted by the Institute of Politics.
McChrystal, former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, was joined by Mayor Annise D. Parker of Houston, Texas, and Spencer T. Kympton, the President of The Mission Continues, an oganization committed to empowering veterans. Harvard Kennedy School student Daniel P. C. Feehan moderated the event, which was entitled “Ask What You Can Do For America’s Veterans”.
During the event’s introduction, University President Drew. G. Faust addressed the crowd through a pre-recorded video message. In the clip, Faust pledged to promote a culture supportive of military service on Harvard’s campus, praising the relationship between what she termed “two of the United States’ great institutions.”
In an interview with The Crimson after the event, McChrystal discussed the need for Harvard students to pursue public service.
“I think the military of the future has to represent all the parts of society, socially, religiously,” he said. “There have to be more Harvard grads serving. There have to be more Yale grads serving. There’s got to be a good mix.”
McChrystal continued by stressing the importance of building a culture of duty in which students want to served their country.
“You want people at Harvard to feel that this is a responsibility, [like] ‘Of course a percentage of us have to serve in the military.’”
Although he highlighted the need for Harvard students in the armed forces, McChrystal emphasized that service expands beyond the military. “I think if you refer to someone in the service, they ought to be someone who is serving the nation, maybe in uniform, or maybe in some other way.”
McChrystal also echoed the panelists’ discussion of the need for undergraduates, in particular, to join the armed forces. According to Feehan, the vast majority of veterans currently enrolled at Harvard University attend the graduate schools.
“When you come to a place like [Harvard College], the first thing you want to do is hide the fact that you’re a service member because you want to fit in,” McChrystal said. “I think what we’ve got to do is ask undergraduate life to expand its horizon a little bit. Don’t think of freshman as 17, 18, and 19. Think of freshman as 17 to 28.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor called for improvements to the American education system in an address at the Institute of Politics Monday evening.
“One of my priorities this Congress will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable,” Cantor said, advocating for the charter school concept.
But the news of the night came as a protest staged by a campaign led by the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition interrupted Cantor’s appearance. After the group refused requests by Institute of Politics moderator C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 to return to their seats and cease their chorus of, “Lift the ban”, they were escorted out of the forum by security personnel.
Coalition members, who were not forcibly removed, primarily protested Cantor’s support for a two-year-old ban on federal funding of a needle exchange program that allows drug users to trade in dirty needles for new ones, thus preventing the spread of blood-borne diseases like HIV.
When asked whether he would vote to lift the appropriations ban if it is brought back before Congress on March 27, Cantor said, “No, I won’t.”
To this, protesters replied, “Shame on you!” and began their chant of, “Lift the ban!”
The coalition was participating in a campaign with Harvard Medical School students and members of local AIDS awareness group ACTUP/Boston.
The protest launched when coalition member Darshali A. Vyas ’14 made the first statement of the post-speech discussion, asking fellow campaigners to stand up with her. After the delegation had risen, Vyas recounted Cantor’s last visit to the IOP, which the group also protested.
During that visit, Cantor stated that the government did not have the money to fund certain AIDS research and treatment funding.
Vyas said that after being escorted out, she and fellow demonstrators “chanted in front of the window until [HUPD] asked us to stop” and told them to move away from the Kennedy School’s Littauer Building.
Indoors, Cantor continued to participate in the question and answer session, remarking that “As far as the activists who just left, it wouldn’t be Harvard without that.”
Cantor’s address, which preceded the protest, focused primarily on federal spending cuts and the importance of medical advancements, something he said would be aided by improvements to the American education system.
Cantor also discussed the need to fix the higher education system, saying that this issue was at the center of his conversation with University President Drew G. Faust earlier Monday morning.
In addition to discussing general goals for the country during his speech, Cantor also stated his positions on a number of contentious political issues currently plaguing leaders in Washington. He stressed that mental health care reform deserves prominent attention in the gun control debate that has developed since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, pointing to Virginia’s response to the 2007 shooting at Virginia Technical University. After the shooting, the state mandated updates to its mental health databases, thus improving the gun-buyer background check system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 12, 2013, at 4:38 p.m.
University President Drew G. Faust was kept in the dark about the secret administrative search of resident deans’ email accounts to trace the origin of a media leak, she said in a statement Monday.
The covert search of email accounts was part of a broader investigation to identify who was responsible for leaking an internal email sent between administrators about the Government 1310 cheating case. The search was authorized by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and the University’s General Counsel, with the support of Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Faust’s statement gave few details about what she did or did not know.
“Back in September, I was made aware that there was concern about a potential breach in the confidentiality of the process, and was told it had been resolved. But I was not informed of specifics,” she said in the statement.
A University official confirmed that Faust was not told of the subject-line search of emails.
In her statement, Faust said that after speaking to Smith and Hammonds, she believed that administrators had taken the necessary steps to protect student and Administrative Board confidentiality.
“I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned, especially our students,” the statement said.
The question of whether Harvard broke its own privacy policies rests on whether resident deans’ email accounts are governed by the email privacy policy for faculty or staff—a distinction that FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to clarify.
The faculty policy allows for searches of emails, but only when notice is given to the account owners. If this policy applies to the email accounts of resident deans, Harvard would have violated its rules.
The staff policy, on the other hand, allows administrators to access electronic files of non-faculty “at any time” and “for any business purpose” without requesting permission. If resident deans’ email accounts fall under the staff policy, Harvard would have remained consistent with its policies.
In her statement, Faust said the searches prompt legitimate questions about whether administrators were right to access accounts without prior notification.
“I share the view that questions about whether more resident deans should have been informed sooner are fair to ask,” Faust said. “And I believe that debates about the rights and responsibilities of members of our community are healthy.”
When asked about Faust’s statement, mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid, a vocal critic of Harvard’s handling of the cheating scandal and its fallout, said he had no doubt that Harvard acted within legal bounds in authorizing the search.
Still, he raised questions about the factors that influenced the decision regarding what to tell Faust.
“Obviously they must have had some misgivings if this became known,” Schmid said.
He added, “They certainly realized that if this became public, there might be quite a bit of negative faculty reaction.”

A delegation of workers at the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, which is housed in a Harvard-owned building, presented hotel management with a petition Monday delcaring worker intentions to start the process of considering unionization.
The petition, which was signed by a majority of the hotel’s workers, outlines their desire to be able to decide without the influence of hotel management whether or not to join UNITE HERE! Local 26—the same union that represents Harvard’s dining hall workers.
“We demand that the owner, Harvard University, and management of the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, respect our signatures and agree to a fair process for us to decide whether to have union representation without management interference and intimidation,” the workers wrote in the petition, which they presented to the DoubleTree’s general manger Monday afternoon.
Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, said he is hopeful that the University will work to accommodate the workers’ wishes. He praised the way the University treated Harvard Law School dining hall workers when they went through the process of joining UNITE HERE! Local 26 in December 2011.
“Our union has a very mature and rational relationship with Harvard,” Lang said. “Given Harvard’s track record at the Law School last year where things were done in a very professional and amicable manner, we don’t see why a similar thing can’t happen at the DoubleTree Hotel.”
A Harvard spokesperson could not be reached for comment about the petition Monday afternoon.
Boston City Councilor At-Large Felix G. Arroyo accompanied the delegation to present the petition and spoke with the workers afterwards.
“We’re going to win because of your leadership,” Arroyo said before a crowd of DoubleTree employees. “Members are what make a union strong.”
Representatives from Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement and dining hall workers who are members of UNITE HERE! Local 26 at Harvard also accompanied the hotel employees.
“As students at a University that owns the hotel and pretty much sets policy there, we have a responsibility to back [the workers] up and give them the support they need for a very legitimate cause,” said Ikaika Bayley ’16, a student who showed up to demonstrate his support.
Harvard purchased the DoubleTree Suites, located in Allston across the river from the University’s main campus, in January 2005.

Logan E. Leslie, current Harvard freshman and former active-duty Green Beret, told The Crimson Monday that he plans to seek a seat on Cambridge’s City Council. If elected, the 26-year-old, who lives off-campus with his wife and daughter, would be the first Harvard College student on the Council in recent memory.
Leslie said he hopes to represent a student voice on the Council and make an effort to involve students in the Cambridge community.
“There are a lot of young leaders here,” Leslie said. “They’re passionate. It’s a loss for the town not to try to involve them.”
After completing two combat tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, Leslie is now studying at Harvard on the GI Bill. He said he considers himself both a Cantabrigian and a university student, adding that he plans to live in Cambridge for the foreseeable future with his wife and daughter.
Leslie has identified three main goals that will form the crux of his political platform: improving safety, bringing “common-sense leadership” to the Council, and strengthening university-community relations. Leslie said he believes there is currently a “disconnect” between the city of Cambridge and its university students, and hopes to introduce programming that would involve university students in the community, such as paid internships in local government or subsidies for summer housing.
Leslie said he hopes students will help bolster him to victory in the fall.
“This is where they live right now. This is their community,” he said of students. “It would be nice to get them registered to have a voice on the City Council.”
Leslie would not be the first university student to seek to represent the student voice.
In 2009, Leland Cheung, who was then completing a dual-degree at the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management, ran for City Council. He won, becoming the first University student and the first Asian-American to sit on the Council.
According to Robert Winters, a local political commentator and an instructor at the Harvard Extension School, Cheung won in 2009 with considerable support from Cambridge’s student population. When he ran for re-election in 2011, however, it was Cambridge’s Asian population that was his loyal voting bloc, Winters said.
Winters said he believes that bringing University students to the polls for City Council elections is difficult because much of what the Council addresses is not directly relevant to students’ lives.
“Most of what they are focusing on is not really going to resonate,” Winters said. “It’s always been a bad calculation to count on too many student votes.”
Leslie expressed a desire to garner votes from the Cambridge community, but also emphasized the importance of the student bloc.
“I would like to impress upon students how important their support is,” Leslie said. “I want to impress the relevance of this; this is the most grassroots level of government.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This team was supposed to be defined by the scandal.
This team’s only senior averaged sixteen minutes a game last year.
This team’s second tallest rotation player is 6-7. Princeton’s shortest starter is 6-5.
This team wasn’t supposed to win the Ivy League.
But here we are.
The Harvard men’s basketball team (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) has faced adversity all season long. From the opening game, a 67-64 loss on a UMass wing trey with three seconds to go, to the road sweep last week at the hands of the Killer P’s, nothing has come easy. Losing graduates Keith Wright and Oliver McNally was going to be hard enough, but the withdrawals of Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey in the wake of the Gov 1310 scandal forced the team to change the entire way it played.
Somehow, the team found an answer for every stumbling block.
Suddenly, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers was thrust into the starter’s role without a true backup. He was up to the challenge. Chambers played every game, leading the team in assists and minutes played. Without a strong inside post presence, coach Tommy Amaker reverted to unorthodox four-guard lineups featuring Chambers, sophomore Wesley Saunders, junior Laurent Rivard, and senior Christian Webster. No matter. The Crimson shot 39.9% from behind the arc, good for third in the nation. After losing four of its top five scorers, Harvard lacked a go-to scorer. Saunders stepped up. The sophomore led the Ivy league with an efficient 16.5 point a game on 54 percent shooting from the field (53 percent from three) and led the team in steals while serving as its best perimeter defender.
The Crimson will enter the NCAA tournament as a likely 14 or 15 seed. The team’s nonconference schedule is chock-full of near-misses; chances to post statement wins at UConn, St. Mary’s, and Memphis resulted in close losses. It posted only four wins in conference play by double digits, with eight games decided by fewer than seven points. However, Harvard heads into the tournament with recent history on its side.
Since 2010, Ivy League teams have posted a respectable 2-3 record in March Madness. The Cornell Sweet Sixteen team of 2010 is in a class of its own. That squad posted an absurd 15.4 average margin of victory en route to a 13-1 Ancient Eight record and dismantled Temple and Wisconsin by a combined 34 points in its first two tournament games. The next year, a 25-7 Princeton Squad held its ground start-to-finish against a Kentucky team that made the Final Four and sent 5 players to the NBA in a 59-57 loss. Last year, the Crimson fell to a talented Vanderbilt squad, 79-70, that recorded one of two wins over national champion Kentucky and had starters Festus Ezeli, John Jenkins, and Jeffrey Taylor drafted in the first 31 picks of the 2012 NBA draft.
In addition, the Crimson's post-season chances are boosted by the recent trend of parity in college basketball. Whether it is the preponderance of ‘one-and-done’ freshmen that sprint to the NBA after one year of college hoops or improved recruiting in the Ivy League, the numbers point to parity across the college basketball landscape. Only two years ago two mid-major programs made the Final Four.  The current number one team in the nation, Gonzaga, hails from the historically impotent West Coast Conference. Now, more than ever, any team has a shot at cutting down the nets.
Unfortunately for Crimson fans, the numbers also show that this Harvard team isn’t nearly as dominant as those other Ancient Eight squads. While the three previous squads had average margins of victory of over eight and a half points a game, this Crimson squad checks in with nearly half that at four and a half. Ranked 151st of the country in defensive efficiency according to stats guru Kem Pomeroy, the Crimson rank near the bottom of all of college basketball in every rebounding category.
The saving grace of this Harvard team is its ability to fill the basket up in a hurry – a handy skill come March. With the second best true shooting percentage – a metric measuring a team’s overall shooting ability—in the nation, Harvard can shoot with anyone. The ability to make threes can take lower seeded teams deep in the tournament.  Just ask Stephen Curry’s Davidson squad, Brad Stevens’ Butler teams, or even Jeff Foote’s Cornell team.
With no rotation player larger than 6-8, the Crimson will inevitably be smaller than its on-court opponents. Like they have been all year, the team will be underdogs fighting upward battles. This team wasn’t supposed to be here. Now that it is, history and the magic of the three may prove its saving graces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Harvard’s most important weekend of basketball to date, it was a freshman that rose to the occasion.
Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers has guided the Crimson offense all season, but his clutch plays down the stretch against Columbia and efficient three-point shooting against Cornell helped earn Harvard (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) its third straight Ivy League Championship and second outright title.
Chambers went five-of-six from the field for 16 points in the Crimson’s 56-51 win over the Lions (12-14, 4-9).  After a Princeton loss to Yale on Friday gave Harvard a chance to clinch at least a share of the Ivy title, Saturday’s match-up against the Big Red (13-18, 5-9) became that much more important. Chambers stepped up in the spotlight, hitting three-of-four from downtown on his way to a 16-point, five-assist night in a 65-56 victory over Cornell.
With Princeton’s loss to Brown later that evening, the Crimson earned its second straight bid to the NCAA tournament.
After trailing for most of the night against a Columbia team that beat Harvard by 18 on its home court, Chambers put the Crimson up for good with 40 seconds to go off of an acrobatic and-one lay-up.  Taking the rebound from sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi, Chambers pushed the ball up the court one-on-four before hitting the tying lay-up and go-ahead free throw.
“[Harvard coach Tommy Amaker] had told us that if we got a rebound off of a miss he wanted us to come down and try and get something early in transition,” Chambers said. “Steve grabbed the rebound and got it to me, and then I saw a little crease and took it.”
The Crimson trailed 28-20 going into halftime, but an eight-nothing run capped off by a Chambers steal and ensuing lay-up tied the game at 30-all. The Lions maintained a slight advantage over Harvard until the final minute of the game.
The Crimson struggled from beyond the arc against Columbia, only going three-for-11. However, Harvard made up for it by hitting 15 free throws on the night, with Chambers leading the way going six-for-seven from the charity stripe.
“[Siyani] is a great playmaker, and he gets us open shots,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “And if we have open shots, we should probably be making them.”
While the Crimson may have struggled with the deep ball on Friday, it was the key to Harvard’s victory on Saturday against the Big Red. The team shot nine-of-15 on the night for an outstanding 60 percent from beyond the arc.  Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard hit four from deep on the night, with three coming in the first half. Chambers, not to be outdone, hit all three of his shots from beyond the arc in the second half.
The Crimson ended the first period on a nine-to-one run, with a nifty lefty layup from Chambers as time expired to make it 32-24.
The home squad was able to maintain a double-digit lead throughout most of the second half, finding a large portion of its success from downtown. Co-captain Christian Webster, Rivard, and Chambers all hit from deep to help the Crimson keep its advantage.
After a Cornell layup dwindled the lead down to 57-50 with 4:30 to go, it became a game of free throws.  Harvard scored its final eight points on free throws from sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, Rivard, and Chambers.
“I’m proud of our guys,” Amaker said. “We are an incredibly young team and to talk about Siyani in his first year in our program and all the other freshman to be a part of this. We hope this can be big part of moving forward.”
Just a year removed from playing high school ball for Hopkins Sr. High, Chambers has adjusted quickly to the college game after being thrust into the starting lineup.  Chambers leads the Ivy League in assists, averaging 5.7 per game, a mark also good enough for first place nationally among college freshmen. The point guard is sixth in the conference in scoring with 12.9 per game and was a nominee for the Bob Cousy award that goes to the best point guard in the country.
While most television personalities like to refer to true freshman as inexperienced during the NCAA tournament, Chambers, according to both his statistics and Amaker, does not fall into that category.
Chambers has started all 28 games for the Crimson this season—one that included a very strong non-conference schedule and the always-competitive Ivy League. Not only has Chambers started every contest, but he averages 37.8 minutes a game, placing him first in the Ivy League and fourth in the nation.
“Certainly Siyani’s shots seemed to be incredibly timely,” Amaker said. “At the end of the half and the threes, he’s been just timely for us an awful lot this year.”

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
Kirkland residents act like Yale students during Harvard-Yale weekend: they just can't stop telling you how great their House is and how much better they are by association. Sure, we'd like them to tone it down a bit and maybe stop making out with each other, but unlike the Yalies, Kirkland students genuinely have a lot to brag about. From the great location to the homey vibe, Kirkland looks like it's straight out of a Harvard catalogue, causing us to wonder why Mark Zuckerberg decided to leave early.
Housing Quality: Kirkland housing is a mixed bag. Some upperclassmen luck out with big common rooms and spacious singles, but the House is also littered with walkthrough rooms and n suites. All of the rooms, however, are wood-paneled with plenty of natural lighting, and few students end up with bunk beds or cramped triples. In other words, it's definitely better than Winthrop for space and beats the concrete jungle that is Mather in looks, but the tradeoff is the chance that your room will be small.
Above all, though, it's all about location, location, location. With rooms right next to all the River Houses and JFK Street, but closer to the Yard than most, Kirkland House is in the perfect spot for many. With its Old Harvard vibe and cozy atmosphere, people walking into Kirkland might let out a sigh and say, "Ah, now this is Harvard."
Dining Hall: Kirkland's dining hall is the most intimate on campus. There are many tables that seat only four people, which is well suited for one of the smaller Houses on campus. Also, because the dining hall serves fewer people than other Houses do, many say the food is of a higher quality (though the kitchen is shared with Eliot). Kirkland residents report they can always find a friendly face in the dining hall, and it's close enough to the Yard for students to make it back for lunch. There is also outdoor seating available, which is nice on the two days a year when it's warm enough outside to venture forth without a parka.
Facilities: Kirkland has plenty of common rooms, a community kitchen, a House gym, and a basement ping pong area. The House also has a spectacular library housed in the contiguous Hicks House building next door. Kirkland uses its Junior and Senior Common Rooms to great effect for its incredible Conversations with Kirkland series, where Kirkland residents get to sit in on discussions with famous politicians, artists, and academics. Today the former President of Mexico, Felipe Calderon spoke there. Past guests include Drew Faust, Nate Silver, and Salma Hayek.
House Masters: Kirkland residents report being extremely pleased with their House Masters, Tom and Verena Conley, who are truly a one of a kind pair. The two can often be seen eating in Kirkland dining hall or walking their Bernese Mountain dogs around town. They are both Professors at the College (Tom in Romance Languages and Literature and VES, Verena in Romance Languages and Literature and Literature), giving them additional connections to the undergraduate community. As an added bonus, Tom offers a Kirkland wine seminar in the spring to all Kirkland residents (21+) during which he imparts his words of wisdom about all things Sauvignon Blanc. Let's just say not all House Masters are as willing to teach their residents about the finer things in life.
Extra: If wine's not your thing, you can join the Kirkland Brew Club, which makes several different House brews for fellow Kirklanders to sample at Stein Clubs. The House also boasts several other special, Kirkland-only events. Residents are known to go way, way overboard for Secret Santa week in December. And finally, of course, there is Incestfest, the annual Kirkland-only hook up party. Talk about brotherly (and sisterly) love.
Our rankings so far:
3. Kirkland
4. Adams
5. Cabot
6. Winthrop
7. Lowell
8. Pforzheimer
9. Mather
10. Leverett
11. Dunster
12. Currier
Disclaimer: Flyby's 2013 House Rankings, though unscientific, are based on careful research and review by the Flyby Staff. We encourage you to read the full posts—rather than the rankings alone—to learn more about each House. As difficult as it makes our jobs, thereis good to be found in every one of the twelve.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
This year, Adams House seems to be pushing its dining hall and gold digs as its main perks. But as anyone who knows and loves this occasionally war-mongering House will tell you, there's a lot more to Adams than meets the eye. A perennial favorite, centrally-located Adams is the House of gargoyles, gilded walls, and a whole lot more (the list, as you'll see, goes on and on).
House Spirit: Adams residents have proven their fierce loyalty to their Gold Coast home time and again by being some of the most active players in Harvard's occasional House Wars. The Pfoho-Adams War of 1999 was so seismic that it earned a few lines of text on Wikipedia. And although Currier allegedly initiated the poll-tampering that sparked conflict in the 2012 Interhouse War, Adams was the first House to formally declare war.
When they're not signing treaties or mapping battle plans, students spend time bonding at the weekly event "Carpe Noctem," where they enjoy beer, pizza, and elaborately themed decorations.
Housing Quality: Adams House offers a variety of rooming options that leave most students very satisfied with their cribs. With most sophomores living in n housing, residents have a chance at snagging singles all three years. Like the rest of Adams House, the rooms are quintessentially Harvard, complete with dark wood accents and other pleasing, old school aesthetic touches. And while Claverly is located a bit farther from the rest of the House, the building retains some of its former Gold Coast swank, plus a floor set-up that makes it perfect for socializing.
Dining Hall: Few people have been known to complain about the looks of the Adams dining hall. Many more, however, have been heard complaining about the dining hall being overcrowded during lunch and dinner; despite restrictions, it seems that freshmen from the Yard and upperclassmen friends from the River (and beyond) still manage to sneak their way into the centrally-located facility. Residents of Pforzheimer House have also been allowed to eat in Adams since their victory in the Pfoho-Adams War of 1999. If the excess of Pfoho interlopers proves too much, however, the House has a small dining hall located off the main room where students can study and eat in a quieter environment.
Facilities: The majority of the House is connected by underground tunnels that bear colorful murals and images of Winnie the Pooh. Supposedly, there are courtyards, too, though Adams guards them from non-House residents. The House has a Gold Room that makes for a great picture to show friends back home. Students use the Pool Theater for theatrical productions and movie screenings. The House library is beautiful, open 24 hours a day, and restricted to Adams residents. And while Winthrop residents may boast that JFK (perhaps/probably) had some sexual escapades in their House, the future president worked on his senior thesis in the Coolidge Room in Adams' Randolph Hall; not quite as kinky, but still a great space to do work.
 
House Masters: Adams House is currently enjoying the Palfrey Era, which we're inclined to call the Golden Age. John G. "Sean" Palfrey '67 and Judith S. "Judy" Palfrey '67 are two of the best-loved House masters you'll find at Harvard. Not only do they know every House resident by name, they also invite students to study and munch on snacks at their residence every Sunday (and have been known to dress in drag at the Adams House Drag Night). And if all that isn't enough, has any other House master taken the time to compile a list that rivals Dr. Palfrey's "100 Things To Do in Adams"? We didn't think so.
Extra: A number of pretty cool people once lived in these hallowed halls (though some did so before the buildings were collectively known as Adams House). Notable former residents include the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, actor Jack Lemmon '47, and Henry Kissinger '50 (who lived in Claverly). The Bow & Arrow Press holds weekly open houses that allow students a chance to hang out and print posters, invitations, and cards. Black tie readings of Winnie the Pooh and the House's Winter Feast are other popular Adams House traditions. The only real downside of the House may be occasional visits from River critters and hungry Crimson editors (who are already planning next year's House rankings).
Our rankings so far:
4. Adams
5. Cabot
6. Winthrop
7. Lowell
8. Pforzheimer
9. Mather
10. Leverett
11. Dunster
12. Currier
