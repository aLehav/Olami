After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students arriving on Harvard’s campus this fall discovered that the University with the progressive approach to education had made several structural changes to the college’s courses of academic study. Aside from the much-publicized overhaul of the Core Curriculum in favor of the new Program in General Education, this school year marks the first full year of a revamped English curriculum. While the changes to the English program attempt to facilitate more productive interactions between students and their course material, some concentrators feel that the modifications to the advising system have need for improvement.First introduced this past spring, the English department has entirely remodeled its course options and its approach to advising. Presently, concentrators can decide to keep their sophomore tutorial professor as their advisor if they so choose. For those students lacking such an opportunity, whether because the professor has left Harvard or because the student would prefer a different advisor, the department offers a team-strategy advising system, comprised of Undergraduate Program Administrator Jeff Berg, Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Daniel Donoghue, and Coordinator of the Secondary Field Melissa Lassonde. However, those who prefer the one-on-one attention of a personal advisor face a dilemma. “For someone who’s maybe not as comfortable with their sophomore seminar professor, it might be nice to have the option of getting an advisor within the department,” says Emily B. Hecht ’11. Those students who have encountered challenges with the team advising system typically cite its perceived distance and detachedness as its main problem. Brittney R. Lind ’11, a former English concentrator, primarily met with her advisors only on Study Card Day. “My roommates or my friends would say, ‘Oh, I have to meet with my advisor.’ I would think ‘Why? I know what the requirements are... It just didn’t occur to me to go to them very much,” she says. Lind, who is now a psychology concentrator, admits that she could have sought the help of certain administrative members and that her tutorial professor had expressed willingness to meet personally to discuss non-academic matters. However, according to Lind, the psychology department has been more proactive in its advising strategy, for the most part because concentrators are assigned a specific advisor who contacts them directly. In comparison, Lind says, the English department relies more on the initiative of its students and communication—via Berg—to prompt contact between concentrators and potential advisors.There have been varying responses to the advising system, however; some students have expressed their comfort in seeking help from the department’s administration. “Someone is always in the office; someone’s door is always open,” says Millicent M. Younger ’10.The focus on improving personal relationships between department members and concentrators has also been reflected in the effort to facilitate academic dialogue between students and their professors. Traditionally based on large lecture-style classes, the English department will now offer a series of smaller, seminar-sized groups, organized into four categories: “Arrivals,” “Diffusions,” “Poets,” and “Shakespeares.” “Arrivals” and “Diffusions” discuss the introduction and spread of English language influence, while “Poets” and “Shakespeares” analyze their title subjects in a variety of in-depth contexts.In explaining the logic behind such a shift, Donoghue says, “Pedagogically, we wanted to move away from mandatory, large lecture courses... We wanted to make it of a smaller size so that there would be more interaction between the professor and the student.” The English faculty and administration are currently working on increasing the number of courses offered in the new categories, because presently, not many classes are available that fall under the four headings.While the new curriculum is currently posing some restrictions on which classes concentrators can take to fulfill course requirements under the four groupings, the department has loosened its provisions in order to encourage personalized paths of study. For example, there are no courses concentrators must strictly take, such as English 10a and 10b, “Major British Writers” Parts I and II, which was required under the previous curriculum. “The new curriculum leaves a lot more space for people to really pursue what they’re interested in with the new departmental classes,” Younger says. “That’s what I think is the really great thing about the new curriculum.”For some students, the elimination of the traditional lecture-style courses has resulted in a loss of a unifying literary experience, because these classes provided a common basis of literature for the field. However, most also feel that they are no longer missing out on subjects they would have otherwise pursued had it not been for the mandated classes. In addition, concentrators have expressed their enthusiasm for the smaller class sizes, as the intimate atmosphere lends itself more easily to a higher level of discussion and analysis. “I think there’s a lot of wisdom behind the idea of having a smaller class,” Lind says. “For literature, it tends to be a better way to study.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucked away on a tree-lined Cambridge side street, the Maria L. Baldwin School regularly attracts some of the greater Boston area’s newest fashion talent. On select Sundays each month, a few splashy sandwich boards along Massachusetts Avenue alert pedestrians to the Design Hive. Located in the school’s auditorium, the self-proclaimed “retail experience,” and “urban street market” showcases the work of independent designers and various artisans. Just beyond the public school’s front doors, crayon-scribbled artwork mingles with arrow signs beckoning shoppers downstairs to the gymnasium, where smiling vendors volunteer information about their wares—those dresses are made from 100% organic materials and these handwoven handbags are actually made from recycled candy wrappers. On stage, a DJ spins a steady stream of feel-good tunes, the sounds of “Summer Nights” reverberating off the walls.It’s a far cry from the frenzied, bustling chaos of early autumn in New York City, whose Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, an eight-day whirlwind of runway shows and presentations, came screeching to a halt yesterday. Editors, buyers, socialites, starlets, and It girls converge upon the city biannually to kick off the sartorial festivities along with a sprawling flock of photographers, journalists, and hangers-on, only to later resume the party across the pond in London, Milan, and finally Paris.With these four fashion capitals essentially dominating the industry on the basis of tradition and clout alone, it’s easy to overlook the countless other fashion weeks cropping up in cities around the globe, to varying effect. Tokyo and Copenhagen maintain a loyal following with cult native designers like Junya Tashiro and Henrik Vibskov, while São Paolo is also emerging as a worthy contender. Still the future of Los Angeles’ once-successful fashion week is uncertain in the current economic climate, suffering from waning corporate sponsorship and the steady relocation of local talent. And here in Beantown, the Boston Fashion Week has been hovering below the mainstream media’s radar for years. As the complicated formula for success in the global fashion arena continuously becomes more unpredictable, the laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere that permeates the Design Hive appears peculiarly quaint. Yet this calm, collected approach to the commonly high-pressure flights of fashion industry fancy is in fact an essential component of Bostonian style, one that can be seen across all aspects of the local industry. NOT JUST ANOTHER FASHION WEEKWhile the proliferation of fashion weeks appears to be a recent development, with eight cities celebrating inaugural ones this year alone, Boston’s has been going strong for more than a decade. Spearheaded by founder and executive director Jay Calderin, the event aspires to recreate the buzz of similar productions in New York while eschewing the unwelcoming exclusivity. “The local designers and fashion community didn’t have a central voice.... The whole Bryant Park thing was fairly new,” he says, referring to the host location of the twice-annual New York Fashion Week, “[And] I thought, ‘Let’s do something similar, except for a Boston audience.’ It would be grassroots and very accessible.” Since its inception in 1995, Boston Fashion Week has maintained this egalitarian attitude. A glance at this year’s schedule, which spans from Sept. 25 to Oct. 2, reveals an assortment of consumer-friendly events, including a recession-ready shopping tour and an introduction to the industry for teenagers, all open to the public with minimal or no admission fees.Though New York’s fashion week originally inspired Boston’s own, Calderin insists that the city isn’t competing for feature coverage in Vogue or a star-studded front row. “I think [Boston’s] coming into its own for a particular identity. It has less to do with all the pomp and circumstance and more with the smart aspect of fashion,” Calderin says. Yet he acknowledges that the local fashion week does not currently garner the attention that other cities receive in terms of media coverage, noting, “Obviously we would love to have national coverage, but the truth of the matter is Boston... is not going to be high on the list of priorities.” In spite of the lack of high-profile media attention, a discernible Bostonian aesthetic is emerging over time. “Here in Boston, people will have fun with trends and playful things, but [the trends] don’t have staying power,” Calderin says. “Here, we’re seeing more of the art and science of fashion being celebrated.”Whereas the romance of Paris or the grit of downtown Manhattan has inspired many a feminine frill or sleek black garment, it is the hardy intellectualism of Boston that informs local designers. “Bostonians really pride themselves on being academic, and it’s such a college town, too,” Calderin says. “[Boston’s] being recognized as a city where you can cut your teeth as a designer... and do really cool things for the sake of doing them.” Citing collaborations between designers and MIT students that have produced technologically innovative fabrics as an example, he continues, “It’s kind of cutting-edge because you get to be an artist and a mad scientist.”  SAY NO TO UGGS: THE ANTI-FAD CAMPAIGNEchoing the glitz and glamour of New York Fashion Week itself, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour took the notion of consumer incentives to dizzying new heights on Sept. 10 with Fashion’s Night Out. Billed as “a global initiative to promote retail, restore consumer confidence, and celebrate fashion,” amidst an economic recession, the event took place throughout the five boroughs of New York City—with designers and celebrities stationed at nearly every other store—and in cities from London to Beijing. “Let’s make shopping fun again,” designer Isaac Mizrahi exclaims in one of the event’s promotional videos.Though Boston isn’t included on the cosmopolitan roster of participating cities, Mayor Thomas M. Menino issued an official proclamation which allowed Boston to declare its own Fashion’s Night Out. Menino highlights the importance of the city’s fashion industry, noting it “employs thousands of people and creates millions of dollars in tax revenues for the city,” which necessitates a concentrated effort to reinvigorate sales. Shana Yansen, founder and president of the eco-conscious online boutique Jute and Jackfruit agrees that her sales could stand to see an increase. “We’re an online company, so we make sales nationwide,” she remarks on her year-old Arlington-based business venture’s range of customers. “Still, we could use a boost.”However, that boost has to sustain itself without the aid of gimmicks in order to have a lasting effect. “The whole thing [Fashion’s Night Out] is designed to create a stir, and to get that economic push that we need nowadays, but what I liked... that the Boston retail community embraced was to get creative about engaging the customer,” Calderin says. “Yes, we want to make the sales, but how are you going to stand out from the next person?”For most Boston stores, this initiative is more than a one-night engagement. In the case of an e-commerce site like Jute and Jackfruit, consistently catching the eye of potential customers involves making its brand visible beyond the Internet. Yansen runs a booth each month at Design Hive, featuring environmentally friendly clothes and accessories. She also connects with consumers at Down:2:Earth, a local sustainable living exposition.For other fledgling retail ventures, however, attracting buyers still takes a dash of creativity, genuine friendliness, and the old-fashioned tactics so typical of the Boston scene. If the whimsically styled mannequins in the window of Cambridge’s Vintage Revenge don’t pull you in, owner Denise Goldhagen and her exuberant Great Dane, Yentzer, will. Goldhagen, who opened up shop two months ago after shuttling the business throughout the Midwest for 11 years, admits to handing out flyers, publicizing herself on the Internet, and even placing an ad in the phone book, though “hardly anybody even reads the darn thing anymore.”Yet it’s the painstakingly acquired collection of vintage clothing, ranging from the 1880s to the 1980s and dry cleaned and mended by Goldhagen herself that will certainly keep the business afloat. “I have no life,” Goldhagen jokes, explaining that she often sews quality buttons onto 1950s garments simply because the era produced shoddy originals. The steady stream of compliments from customers proves that her work does not go unnoticed. “This store is phenomenal,” a shopper cooed breathily upon entering.Echoing Calderin’s notion that the Boston shopper resists flash in the pan trends, Goldhagen says, “I’m always in, and I’m always out. My garments have lasted 50, 60, 80 years, and the things they make today are just disposable clothes.” Instead, she seeks out pieces that are “relatively clean” with “no rips or tears,” regardless of era or fad. Likewise the Boston fashion blogosphere participates in a cool disregard of the next It item, taking notice of stylish residents regardless of whether they’re wearing the season’s latest looks. Martini Severin is one such blogger and the photographer behind Beyond Boston Chic, “a part of a growing street-style movement around the world where photographers attempt to capture the style aesthetic or essence of their city.” “It’s hard to describe the “Boston look” because there are so many transient groups here,” she writes in an email to The Harvard Crimson. “There are the students.... there are the tourists. The one thing I have noticed though is that each city and neighborhood has its distinct style. Beacon Hill as we would expect is a bit preppy. Somerville tends to be a bit hippie. The South End tends to be a bit laid back and minimal in their dress—think of Scandinavian style. Every city is different which is what makes it interesting.”  Boston’s contribution to the melting-pot of fashion scenes appears to be its subtle rebellion against hyper-commercialism. Like the title of Goldhagen’s store, which signifies a defiant alternative to the cheaply-made clothing she feels dominates the market, the Boston fashion scene is engineered to quietly subvert the flashy, elitist extravagance of the fashion industry at large. From industry vets to retail newcomers, there appears to be a sense of solidarity and customer inclusion that seems to evade the various other fashion scenes, making the Boston industry appear at once welcoming and inherently self-contained. Though it may be years until Boston’s name enters the list of fashion hot spots, those who partake in the city’s sartorial scene are certainly privy to a uniquely local brand of considerate commerce and innovative design. —Staff writer Roxanne J.

Tracy Kidder ’67– Pulitzer Prize winner, literary journalist, and Harvard graduate–has been writing award-winning non-fiction for the past 35 years. While many of his books center on life in his native Massachusetts, his most recent projects have led him to Haiti and now to Burundi, where he traveled to research his latest work, “Strength in What Remains.” Published just over a month ago, it chronicles the life of Deogratias Niyizonkiza, a 24-year-old medical student from Burundi. Niyozonkoza fled his country in 1994 to escape a ravaging ethnic civil war and ended up in New York. He found his footing there by learning English and enrolling at Columbia, eventually returning to Burundi to form a public health organization, Village Health Works. Kidder took a break from his book tour to talk about his new book and his career as a writer.The Harvard Crimson: How did you meet Deogratias, and what compelled you to write about him?Tracy Kidder: I actually met him at Harvard, at Eliot House, about 3 years ago. I’d come to see Paul Farmer [the subject of his earlier book, “Mountains Beyond Mountains”] who had an apartment there. Deo told the outlines of his story to my wife, and as we were driving away, my wife told me a fragment of the story that he told her, and it sat in the back of my mind for several years.I was drawn to him, partly. He’s really charming, and there’s an ineffable quality to him—a straight warmth and enthusiasm. And there was a sense of someone who had been wounded. This is in part a story about courage and determination. The whole thing moves me and horrifies me. Unlike other things I’ve written in the past, this is much more event-driven.THC: What kind of challenges did you have in depicting his story accurately and compellingly?TK: A good part of this story is that the only source I have for it is Deo’s memory, and memory is of course a very plastic thing. I’m absolutely sure that the story is, in its entrails, basically true. I mean, I don’t remember things very well from the day before yesterday, and these are Deo’s 12-year-old memories. This was one of the reasons I wrote the book as I did, and turned to the first person after the reader has heard the bulk of the story. The more remarkable story is what happened in New York, and that I did verify.The experience of being with Deo, watching him in the throes of memory, especially in Burundi, was spooky. It was not so much difficult for me but for him. I was taking him back to the places where it seemed as if his memories were lying in wait for him, alive as some kind of long-lived virus.THC: “Strength in What Remains,” like “Mountains Beyond Mountains,” deals with the issue of healthcare in a developing country. What brought you back to healthcare?TK: I don’t really think in terms of themes; I usually meet someone who interests me. I think of myself as a storyteller, not as a writer of big ideas. You are drawn into Deo’s world. And that world is the world of international health affairs. I think there’s some ridiculous ideas out there that journalists shouldn’t be moved by what they see; there’s a certain built-in detachment to the job itself, but I was moved by what I saw in Haiti, and similarly moved by what Deo has done to create Village Health Works.THC: Tell us a little about Village Health Works.TK: It is a sister organization to Partners in Health [which Paul Farmer founded]. Deo, for the longest time, was their fundraiser, and he did an amazing job; he gathered friends and family from America and Burundi to rally for a public health effort that is by no means complete. They saw 28,000 different patients in their first year of operations, most of whom they treated for free. It has enormous support from the people in the area, has cleaned up water supplies, and tries to work on all the biggest health problems there. Now, it’s really turned its attention to women’s health, which along with clean water is probably the most important thing in developing countries. And who knows, Obama, in Ghana, was talking about African-American cooperation and mutual responsibility. Foreign aid is usually done in such a way that most of the money never gets to the people who need it, but here’s an example of what needs to be done. I think it’s an instrument of peace.THC: You graduated from Harvard in 1967, with a B.A. in English. What did you imagine yourself doing at the time? What most surprises you when you look back on your trajectory?TK: I wanted to be a writer—either Ernest Hemingway or F. Scott Fitzgerald, but I made a pretty stupid mistake and went into the army and into Vietnam. Fortunately it didn’t turn out too badly for me. The way it turned out, it surprises me that it’s worked and that I’ve been able to write for a living. And I feel that although my experience at Harvard was mixed, I’m grateful to two professors: Robert Fitzgerald and David Riggs. What I learned from them in the most general sense is to love literature.THC: Where do you think you’ll go from here?TK: Often the hardest thing for me is figuring out what to do next. I think I’m coming back to America. There’s so much insanity out there. It’s interesting to see what will happen next.Tracy Kidder will be presenting his new book at the Brattle Theatre on Tuesday evening. —Sophie O. Duvernoy

With a name like “The Donkey Show,” it should be unsurprising that an appropriate adjective to describe Diane Paulus’ inaugural production at the newly named Oberon—the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) theatrical club space—is “loose.” In the world of theater, the word might have a negative connotation, but in the world of sex, drugs, and nightclubs—well, it’s just what we like to hear.“The Donkey Show” is loosely based on Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” a framework into which the pimps, hos, and blow atmosphere of the Studio 54 setting fits surprisingly well. Club owner Mr. Oberon (Heather Gordon) uses his Mercury-inspired roller-skating assistant Dr. Wheelgood (Scotty Morgan)—Puck, from the original—to drug his girlfriend Tytania (Rebecca Whitehurst). The scantily-clad disco-diva then falls in love with the local duo of car wash clowns, who make “asses” of themselves while under the influence of Wheelgood’s special concoction. Similarly love-poisoned are Dmitri (Lucille Duncan) and Sander (Rebecca Whitehurst), who both fall for Helen (Erin McShane), leaving Sander’s lover Mia (Gordon) all alone. Bestiality, chaos, and disco music ensue.However, the plot is secondary to the primary goal of Paulus’ new approach to theater at the A.R.T.: experience. “I’m interested in how we can really get to the roots of when theater had power,” she writes in her publicity material, “when it was ritual.” The “ritual” that she’s trying to capitalize on here is the idea of nights out with friends, and though clubbing itself may be a relatively new concept, it actually shares similar foundations with the origins of American theater, which was once a rowdy, sociable, exciting time for all involved. “The Donkey Show,” co-directed by Paulus and Randy Weiner, attempts to bring those good times back, by transporting the audience into the club atmosphere that many of them left behind in the 70s—and that some unknowing theater tagalongs clearly seem to have wished stayed that way. Even before the show begins, Tytania’s glittering fairies—adapted to the more modern interpretation of the term rather than the supernatural Shakespearean conception—work to set the tone for the evening. In a style that would do Of Montreal’s Kevin Barnes proud, these golden boys sparkle atop the rolling cubes set in the dance floor crowd, on which much of the action takes place, allowing the show to be appreciated from all angles. Almost naked except for shining booty shorts and eyeliner, they invite members of the crowd to dance with them as DJ Orlando Chachenski (Samson Kohanski) takes everyone back to Funkytown, or at least loosens them up for the show.Only part of the main attraction takes place on the main stage—most notably, “the” main attraction, the donkey show itself—while the rest plays out around and throughout the crowd. The dialogue primarily consists of singing along to “We Are Family,” “Ring My Bell,” and other such hits, arranged to reflect the plotline. “The Donkey Show” is essentially one large dance party with a vague theatrical reason to keep it going, but the choreography, the movement, the blocking is such that, for the most part,  it seamlessly carries through. Even as they move through the crowd in preparation for their next appearance in the spotlight, the actors keep the audience involved; “Do I look okay?” Sander asked one audience member as he rushed to the stage to meet his love Mia. Though it may not at all resemble the theater that modern audiences are accustomed to, “The Donkey Show” demonstrates a definite grasp of the theatrical, capturing Paulus’ conception for the audience interaction and excitement to come at the A.R.T.—Staff writer Beryl C.D.

Despite its traditional colors, Harvard is apparently one of the greenest schools in the nation, according to the Princeton Review’s “2010 Green Rating Honor Roll” published this past July.  Along with 14 other schools, Harvard received the top score of 99 according to green-rating criteria developed by the Princeton Review and ecoAmerica, a non-profit environmental organization. That recognition has drawn much deserved attention to the abundance of green initiatives taking off at the university.
Many improvements, both large and small, can be found on campus these days. Following last year’s recycling efforts, which gave the university a 55 percent recycling rate that put it at the top of the Ivy League, the university is continuing to pursue numerous waste-reduction strategies. New on campus are the new solar-powered Big Belly trash and recycling compactors, which fill up far less quickly than non-compacting receptacles and reduce the incentive to litter that overflowing trash cans often provide. Recycling has also been incorporated at the Fly-By lunch station beneath Annenberg, now featuring special receptacles for cartons and other recyclable waste.
In light of the current economic climate, the university has done an admirable job of tying the goals of sustainability with cost-cutting imperatives. The heating decrease of two degrees implemented last year within residential suites not only represented an energy-conscious move but also helped the university significantly cut its budget deficit for this fiscal year.
Energy and cost-saving measures are at the heart of Harvard’s new Green Building Guidelines, which govern the construction of buildings costing over $5 million to insure they meet a set of sustainability benchmarks. Harvard now has 20 building projects certified by the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating systems, the most of any institution of higher education in the world. Three have also gone on to earn the highest distinction of a special Platinum certification in recognition of their superior sustainability standards.
The university should be commended for making the far-sighted decision to continue aggressively pursuing green initiatives, even while dealing with a budget deficit and other serious financial issues. Seeing these projects through will offer both financial and environmental paybacks that benefit Harvard and its community for the long term.

America’s most successful children’s education show is still hitting all the right notes. This past Wednesday, just after the president’s health-care address, the 1-2-3 Gang hosted a candid conversation on PBS about job loss, housing woes, personal responsibility, and the importance of family and community. The message was wonderfully uplifting and unclouded: With honest hard work and each other’s help, we can get back to those sunny days.
This is a great show for the whole country, not merely the duck-duck-goose and Dunkaroo demographic. 
As comical as it may sound, Sesame Street has long been a showcase of the best ideals of American liberalism. For 40 years, it’s promoted a vision of our better angels—albeit wrapped up in red and blue monster fur. The focus of the show has always been education through real-world experience, the value of inclusive community, and the wonders of ordinary life. And the lessons haven’t just been for wee babes: Although the messages of Big Bird and Grover may be articulated in terms a child could understand, they are nonetheless refreshingly relevant for the older generation.
Wednesday’s primetime special “Families Stand Together: Feeling Secure In Tough Times,” was an especially apt example of how Sesame Street offers both a message to children and the chance for adults to take a step back and reassess our thinking. Hosted by Al Roker, Deborah Roberts, and financial expert Jean Chatzky, the episode presented practical suggestions to families on how to discuss financial woes with children and weather the economic storm. It also emphasized that this country must face the current crisis with some sense of mutual cooperation. 
In the opening scenes of the show, Elmo’s mother loses her job and has to explain to Elmo—in a slow, Southern drawl—why she’ll be at home more often. After a series of questions by Elmo—Is it Elmo’s fault? Did Elmo buy too many toys? Will Elmo have to move?—the characters travel around the neighborhood to learn lessons from four real families dealing with similar changes.
Along the way, Elmo’s family learns about the perils of instant gratification, the difference between needs and wants, and why Mommy and Daddy need to say no: Elmo can’t have everything Elmo wants, the family needs Elmo’s help. Above all, Elmo learns the importance of talking things out with Elmo’s mother and father.
In between Elmo’s adventures, Al Roker and Deborah Roberts discuss financial matters with real-life families facing difficulties. In a very lucid fashion, the lives of Sesame Street’s adult residents run right alongside the present problems of Wall Street and Main Street. Some of the families featured on the show face not only economic stress, but also what amounts to disillusionment with the American dream. The adults are generally more distraught and more in need of advice than the kids—which is why, once again, this show is for everyone.
What Sesame Street offers to stressed parents is a discussion on how to get help. There are extended conversations about getting loans, short-selling property, finding daycare, and advertising skills. There’s also frank talk about why the current crisis is occurring and a promotion of the idea that many families from many different backgrounds are struggling. Parents shouldn’t beat themselves up too much—in fact, there are many things folks can cooperate on to help each other out. 
For example, the show’s opening scene features just such a positive, practical idea: a community market. As Elmo shops around for odds and ends on the street, Al Roker explains to Elmo that a community market is just “neighbors coming together to buy and sell things” and “make some extra money.” In a later scene—and a symbolic slice of the show’s spirit—one of the neighborhood youths explains to Grover that despite the ambiguity of the phrase, one can’t buy “community” at the “community market.” In fact, he goes on to explain, community can’t be bought at all. Just like family, community is priceless no matter what happens with banks, jobs, or the government.
On Sesame Street, this resounding theme of inclusive community, although empathetic, is not part of an over-idealistic naivete of which the show is too often accused. Although the program has some fanciful overtones—as any children’s program should—the challenges of Sesame Streets are honest and real. 
The show promotes the idea of working together in the context of a very un-ideal environment. Although Sesame Street has many delightful characters, over the years its denizens have faced tough challenges—poverty, family separation, intercultural anxiety, and even urban blight. The show’s message that folks can voluntarily work together despite their differences, and sometimes through their differences, to promote the general welfare is not overly idealistic—it is a profound piece of the American historical narrative.

It’s going to happen any day now. 
I’m not talking about the day that the Mayans are supposed to return to Earth and destroy us by depolarizing our aura, which is not scheduled until 2012. I’m talking about the day we wake up and suddenly no longer understand technology.
No generation has escaped it—one morning, your skill with the eight-track or the record player or the cotton gin suddenly ceases to impress. It’s just one of those inevitable disappointments that come with growing up, like the realization that Santa doesn’t exist or the way that music always takes a turn for the worse after you turn 30. But for our generation, the pain will be especially acute. We’ve grown up on social networks. They’re how we communicate, how we notify acquaintances of our relationships, how we make purchases, even how we keep diaries. What will happen when they are no longer there for us, when that mosquito ringtone “too high-pitched for adults to register” starts to elude our hearing, too? 
This prospect terrifies me, so much so that I sometimes wake up in a cold sweat and go running to the nearest computer to surf the Facebook pages of middle-schoolers. Tweens, the media repeatedly informs me, have their collective fingers on the pulse of the times. If anyone would know what’s in now, they would. (Apparently, I should be monitoring Nick Jonas more closely.) Last time I checked, I detected no worrisome references to new technologies, but that might be because I was using a public terminal and had to stop after only three hours because people were giving me strange looks. I know it’s going to happen, though. Someday, casually surfing the web, I’ll notice people posting about new technologies with names like “harking” or hear young whippersnappers asking each other, “So, do you have a zinf?” I just used the phrase “surfing the web.” Do people even say that anymore? Or do I sound like one of those old folks who asks if you’re “going steady”? How can I know?
(At this point, I usually run to Circuit City and demand “one of everything.”)
Now I can live in denial that such a day will ever come—though, inevitably, it will. The problem with technology, as with fashion, is that it’s impossible to be “in” forever. Yet in fashion, cycles repeat themselves. In 50 years, this sweater will be hip again. When that day comes, my laptop will not only be obsolete, but all my neighbors’ kids will also have chips implanted in their faces that allow them to “zinf” together. My only consolation will be this sweater, which will be unbearably hip. 
And so I frantically scramble to keep up. I almost subscribed to WIRED, but then I realized it was a print magazine and couldn’t possibly be hip to what was going on. Instead, I started following my peers on Twitter. “Never!” I shout, clutching my smartphone in my cold, carpal-tunnel-ridden fingers. “It can’t happen to me!”
But there is a fate worse than obsolescence. It’s the kind of obsolescence that doesn’t realize it’s obsolete, the sensation you get when watching your mother try to “make a blog.” I see it happening all around me. Politicians and professors are all having Rip Van Winkle moments. They lie down for a brief nap after some ninepins, wake up, and suddenly everyone around them is “tweeting.” But then, unlike Rip, they decide to join in. Anyone who’s ever read the tweets of people like Senator Chuck Grassley, an adult who should know better, can justifiably shudder. Don’t they realize that the only people who actually spell the phrase “see you later” as “CUL8R” are those undercover cops who pose as 14-year-olds to catch online predators? These sad Twitter feeds are the technological equivalent of those old women on buses who wear four-inch heels and T-shirts that describe them as “2 Hot 2 Handle.” 
Perhaps it’ll be better just to let go gracefully. Life has its trade-offs. As you age, you lose things like teeth and the ability to play in the ball pit at fast-food restaurants, and you gain things like experience and employer-based health insurance. Maybe what has kept our generation so enmeshed in technology is the fact that most of us lack actual lives. All that time that we spend tweeting our thoughts and emotions to our next of kin, we could be writing the great American novel, starting a business, or just living. Maybe on the not-so-distant morning when I wake up and realize I have don’t have a clue how to zinf, it’ll be because I’m doing something more important. 
But, just in case, I should get back to tweeting now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Queer Students and Allies debated revamping its structure in an effort to grow its active membership at a meeting in Adams House yesterday that drew a higher than expected turnout.The organization’s co-chairs pushed for a plan that would shift at least some portion of the group’s decision-making capacity from a select cluster of executive board members to a series of committees that would seek to give more people a say in decision-making.Proposed changes included reducing the number of committee chairs to one from two per committee, creating an outreach committee, and promoting frequent committee meetings where definitive decisions can be made.The organization’s co-chairs, Christian L. Garland ’10 and Marco Chan ’11, led the “Queer Town Hall,” which drew at least 35 students—substantially more than the number who typically attend the club’s meetings, according to Garland, who termed the turnout “unprecedented.”Currently, Garland said, the group—which changed its name last semester from the Biseuxal, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance—has “anywhere between nine and 700 members,” depending who is counted: board members or people on the e-mail list.Attendees proposed different ways to involve more of Harvard’s queer community in the organization.While Garland and Chan also discussed the possibility of continuing to make decisions through weekly meetings of the committee chairs, they spent the bulk of their time advocating their more grass roots and committee-focused option—and in an informal poll after the meeting, those in attendance showed their tentative support for their plan.But despite the nearly unanimous support for structural changes, more controversial issues were raised. Some voiced their concerns that certain groups, particularly Queer women and bisexuals, were not being adequately represented by the QSA. They called for more female leadership in the organization and for identity-specific breakout meetings.“I come into this room and I see it’s about 80 percent men,” said Emily S. Unger ’13. “I find it off-putting and it’s not that comfortable for me to come to QSA events, which is a problem.”The group also discussed QSA’s role among queer identity groups on campus.Nothing was decided at the meeting, but Garland and Chan said they plan on presenting new proposals based on yesterday’s feedback at their next executive board meeting. Executive board meetings are open to the public.—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

After 27 years of serving ice cream to the Harvard Square masses, Herrell’s Ice Cream’s Dunster St. location may close as early as November.Financial pressure from rising costs and a new competitor in town with prime real estate on Mass. Ave. snowballed into “the perfect storm” for the much-loved ice cream shop, said Herrell’s owner Jeffrey Stanett, making its continued operation impractical, if not impossible.Instead, Stanett said he plans to open a casual restaurant by next spring in an expansion of Herrell’s current location, which he plans to call First Printer Restaurant, Bar, and Grill.Stanett said that labor and materials expenses have grown for the store, and rent has shot upward of $10,000 per month. Consequently, the ice cream shop has not turned a profit for the past 4 or 5 months and has taken subsidies from Stanett for the last few years.But the single largest factor in Herrell’s closing may have been the arrival of J.P. Licks, another locally-based ice cream franchise that opened to much fanfare last summer across the street from Boylston Gate.According to Stanett, J.P. Licks now accounts for a third of the ice cream business in the Square. Stanett praised the quality of his competitor’s goods, adding that J.P. Licks founder Vince Petryk was a friend. But he also noted that J.P. Licks boasted an advantage in location compared to Herrell’s from its Mass. Ave. vantage.J.P. Licks currently holds a lease in a building owned by Harvard Real Estate Services and was invited to be a tenant, Petryk said. As a result, Stanett said, he felt he had not been given an equal opportunity to expand his business. “I would think that after 27 years in the Square, if they really wanted to have another great ice cream store, they would’ve contacted me,” he said. “They would’ve given me a ring because this is a mom and pop, super-clean operation.”Harvard may have also offered J.P. Licks a preferential lease on the prime real estate. Petryk said his monthly rent was about 20 percent lower than the rent on similar buildings in the Square not owned by the University.James Gray, associate vice president of Harvard Real Estate Services, said that leasing to J.P. Licks was consistent with “a commitment to local businesses that bring a unique and quality product” to the Square. “We’re happy to have them,” he said.Gray declined to comment on the terms of J.P. Licks’ lease.On top of the new competition, Herrell’s in Harvard Square has long held an nebulous franchising agreement with the Herrell’s Development Corporation, which currently owns four Herrell’s franchises. For “about 20 years,” the Square’s Herrell’s has not entered into a written contract with the Herrell family, instead relying on a “handshake agreement” with company founder Steve Herrell, Stanett said.Today, Herrell’s Development Corporation is run by Steve Herrell’s former wife Judith Herrell, who recently tried to convince Stanett to sign a written franchising agreement that set royalties at 6 percent. She said that it was a standard contract with lower royalties than major ice cream chains, and that she hoped there were no hard feelings between Stanett and herself.“He marches to the beat of his own drummer,” she said. “If he decided to remain a Herrell’s and pay his royalty and move forward with our company, we would love to have him.”For now, the Square’s assortment of ice cream and frozen yogurt shops is down to five. While Petryk said he did not expect the closing of Herrell’s to give business a big boost, he said he was exploring the possibility of collaborating with Stanett to supply First Printer with ice cream.“His personality is as large as his physical stature,” Petryk said. “I’m sure whatever he’s going to do there is going to be bombastic.”But one long-time customer, whom the Herrell’s staff calls “Karen the Milkshake Lady,” said that nothing could compare to Herrell’s ice cream. “I started coming here in 1985,” she said, sipping her daily milkshake. “Ice cream doesn’t get any better.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Alumni Association announced the 17 finalists for senior class marshal yesterday, a group which will be narrowed to eight in a second round of balloting to begin today. These eight students will take on the responsibility of planning senior class activities, helping pick the Class Day speaker, and organizing future alumni events. The two students with the most votes in the round will be designated first and second marshal. This year, 17 students advanced to the finalist round, whereas in past years there were 16 finalists. Harvard Alumni Association senior class coordinator Alexandra Monti could not be reached for comment last night about the change in numbers.Finalist Andres Castro Samayoa ’10 said that, if elected, he hopes to plan events “that are welcoming for everyone and mindful of all the diversities in our class.”Several of the finalists said that they decided to run for the position to better the events offered for seniors.Windsor G. Hanger ’10 said that she hoped to improve and increase the number of events during senior week, while Desmond A.M. Mitchell ’10 said that he wants to organize more senior events throughout the year to give the Class of 2010 more opportunities to get together during their last year as undergraduates.While Anthony R. Britt ’10 said that he is running for marshal because he has enjoyed serving his peers as a member of the Undergraduate Council and enjoys putting on events, he also said that it is a running joke among his friends that if he is elected, he will bring pop singer Shakira to Harvard Yard for Class Day.So far, campaigning in the marshal race has remained minimal, with some candidates publicizing their candidacies by sending e-mails to their fellow seniors. Both Hanger and Britt said that they have not yet sent any campaign e-mails but plan to send e-mails during the final round. In addition to Britt, Castro Samayoa, Hanger, and Mitchell, the other class marshal finalists are Lawrence D. Arbuthnott ’10, Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, Alyssa Q. Colbert ’10, Shiv M. Gaglani ’10, Jamison A. Hill ’10, Neagheen Homaifar ’10, Jarell L. Lee ’10, Kia J. McLeod ’10, Ami A. Nash ’10, Robert B. Niles ’10, Abby D. Philip ’10, George A. George A. Thampy ’10, and Caleb L. Weatherl ’10. Hill is also a Crimson magazine chair, and Phillip is a Crimson news executive. —Staff writer Lauren D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Union activists and students at yesterday’s labor rally added to their tried-and-true repertoire of bullhorn blasting and sign waving by walking to Mass. Hall to deliver a modest gift to University President Drew G. Faust: a bag labeled “Get Well Harvard,” filled with cards from protesters.
But the gesture was not a sarcastic reference to the University’s recently-announced 30 percent drop in endowment value. 
Instead, the cards left space for people to write “recommendations for a healthy Harvard,” and were intended to highlight a message—that the health of Harvard’s workers is deteriorating, and that the well-being of students and staff will suffer soon as well. Protesters argued that recent layoffs and hour reductions have left janitors with more to do in less time, and that sanitation standards will inevitably suffer—hurting the rest of the Harvard community.
“The first line of defense [against disease] is sanitation, and that’s the function of janitors,” said Daniel B. Becker, a union organizer who represents Harvard’s service workers.
A Harvard police officer accepted the gift bag and brought it into Mass. Hall, but it is unclear if Faust received the offering. Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the matter, saying only that he was “confident cleaning standards are being maintained” and that no Harvard-employed janitors have been laid off this summer.
But the University did slash work hours for over 100 of its own janitors in July, and numerous janitors it employs through outside firms—a group not addressed by Galvin’s statement—have been laid off in recent months as a result of reduced custodial budgets.  
Abigail S. Brown ’11, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, said that officials need to understand that there are “all sorts of people that make up Harvard and need to be recognized as valuable.” While yesterday’s actions were not intended to be conciliatory, Brown said SLAM would be employing various new strategies this year, hopefully embodying more “positive spin” than in the past.
“SLAM is not an anti-Harvard organization,” Brown reiterated.
But other attendees of the rally were more militant. Chanting repeatedly “No justice, no peace,” and “Harvard, escucha, estamos en la lucha” (Harvard, listen, we are in a fight), roughly 50 protesters picketed outside the Holyoke Center, denouncing what they called Harvard’s greed and calling for shared sacrifice by administrators. Geoff P. Carens, a Harvard librarian and union member who frequently organizes such vocal protests, ridiculed the University for saying that it was in the midst of a fiscal crisis and had to lay off workers when the endowment still stands at $26 billion. 
“These people don’t know what a tough decision really is. They’ll never know what it’s like to struggle for something worthwhile,” shouted Bryan Koulouris, a member of advocacy group Socialist Alternative, to the gathered protestors. “That’s what this struggle’s about: It’s about solidarity.”

A lone printer sits on the second floor of Littauer at the center of an otherwise empty room—breathing space for a department that has long complained about its cramped headquarters. But organizers for a new departmental program behind it hope the room will fill up very quickly.The room comes courtesy of the recently-formed Lab for Economic Applications and Policy—a rare splurge amidst the University’s belt tightening—which was formed to promote the use of economics research in crafting public policy.“I want LEAP to be the place policy makers come to get evidence,” said Economics Professor Raj Chetty, who helped found the program as part of his tenure offer at Harvard in 2008.Funding has been allocated on the order of $1 million from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—a major contribution, considering the $77 million round of budget cuts this spring. And though it was promised pre-recession, Chetty said the FAS commitment has not changed.LEAP aims to become the economic department’s laboratory: economic experiments—given short shrift by some because of their relatively high costs—could provide substantive data off of which to base policy, Chetty said. “The basis will be facts.” The program’s resources, for student and junior faculty research, have also enabled the department to invite visiting faculty to the economics department even as budget troubles have caused FAS to restrict conventional funding for visiting faculty.Visitors will teach short-term seminars, but Chetty said their presence will be their greatest contribution. The literal proximity of their offices—and those of other Harvard applied economics professors—to the empty room will bring a plethora of great minds together, including students, junior professors, and Harvard’s senior economists, he said. “I wanted to make sure we had a very interactive environment,” Chetty said.“The building was designed in a day when professors were silver-haired and secretaries were charged with being dragons to keep away students—and that’s not the world we live in, or want to live in, now,” said Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell.The new LEAP initiative is “a small attempt to blast open the walls of Littauer and reduce the sense that it is a prison,” said Economics Professor Claudia Goldin, whose broader renovation plans for Littauer were stymied when the Fine Arts Library was relocated to the building’s ground level last year. An existing room was expanded and the space painted a light yellow. Though only a printer and mini-fridge now sit in the space, couches and coffee machines are expected to arrive within a month, Chetty said.After that, he said, it’s just a matter of  time until the room fills up.“A little free food” might help too, he added.—Staff writer Noah S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s make this clear—the ship is not sinking. But it’s also definitely not yet seaworthy, and that is not a good sign for Harvard women’s soccer.While some teams would be satisfied just to stay afloat, the Crimson was expected to be exactly the opposite. A 2008 season that resulted in a share of the coveted Ivy title wasn’t nearly enough for a hungry Harvard squad. There was more work to be done.That assessment rings truer after this year’s start, which has been, in a word, underwhelming.A season-opening, double-overtime tie with San Diego State was, if nothing else, a solid defensive performance. And even the harshest of critics would be hard-pressed to begrudge the next day’s loss at Connecticut, which received 15 first-place votes in the latest NCAA rankings. But it was obvious to fans and coaches alike that the Crimson was still very much in preseason form.A 1-0 win against struggling New Hampshire the following week provided a boost, though Harvard again had difficulties capitalizing on multiple scoring chances.This past weekend’s pair of matches represented a way for a 1-1-1 team to point itself in the right direction. Alas, the Crimson was shut out last Friday by Long Beach State, having its 10-game home unbeaten streak snapped in the process. Sunday’s 3-2 loss to Hofstra concluded the weekend.It bears repeating that this sort of opening performance is not necessarily cause for panic.First of all, Harvard’s caliber of schedule is no joke. Hofstra was coming off a near-upset of No. 25 Indiana and beat Princeton earlier in the year. As for Long Beach State, the 49ers had dominated No. 21 Missouri, 4-1, before heading to Cambridge.Just as importantly, last year’s team also took some time to get going, and look where they ended up—the NCAA Tournament. To take the comparison even further, that group’s first entry into the win column also came at the expense of New Hampshire in the third game of the season.Perplexing, however, are the Crimson’s struggles when considering its track record and personnel.The desire to win ought to be there. Coming within two successful penalty kicks of advancing to the second round of college soccer’s biggest stage is healthy motivation, to say the least.The players are there too. Yes, Harvard lost key graduating seniors in the midfield and on the backline, but a debilitating loss it was not. As the class of 2009 exited the stage, the situation appeared to be more of an opportunity than a crisis. Last year’s group of juniors took on an increasingly larger role as the season went on, and the adjustment for the Crimson, which consistently relies on underclassmen, was not anticipated to be a major obstacle.Perhaps what is missing isn’t talent, but something more abstract. Senior leadership and team camaraderie are things that take time to develop, no matter how high expectations are. And with 11 players on the field, any lineup change requires an adjustment period, particularly when 10 freshmen are added to a squad.This transition has undoubtedly been hampered by the absence, albeit temporary, of another key figure from last year. Senior Christina Hagner—coming off a breakout season in which she started all 18 games—has not yet seen the field due to a minor case of patellar tendinitis. Losing its leading goal scorer from last year will hurt any team, especially one whose strength is on the defensive end.So what does the future hold for Harvard? There are hints of good and bad. A 3-0 deficit against Hofstra was made respectable with two Crimson goals in the final 10 minutes.The offensive outburst must continue if Harvard is to have any hope this weekend, when it plays Friday night at No. 6 Boston College and Sunday at Boston University. Say what you will about determination and resilience, but riding a four-game losing streak into the Ivy season opener would be less than ideal.On the other hand, last year’s squad did manage to battle the Eagles—ranked 12th in the nation at the time—to a 1-1 draw. The tie extended what would eventually be a six-game unbeaten streak for Harvard, which would later string together six-straight league wins on its way to the Ancient Eight crown.If the Crimson wishes for history to repeat itself, it had better start soon.—Staff writer Dennis J.

The Harvard men’s water polo team won their first divisional game, beating MIT yesterday at Blodgett natatorium.  The Crimson (2-6, 1-0 CWPA) gave up the first goal but quickly evened the score, pulled ahead, and never looked back as they cruised to a 9-6 victory over the Engineers (1-8, 0-1 CWPA).The players were motivated by the win, as Harvard had come away from their first two tournaments with a 1-6 record.“Our first seven or eight games were a pretty tough start,” said junior co-captain Bret Voith, “but it’s good to start our league schedule, and just get a good first [conference] victory.” Crimson head coach Erik Farrar was satisfied with the way his team performed.“It was a great team effort—a lot of guys jumped out,” Farrar said. “Everybody played really well.  I’m very pleased.” “It was great to get a win in front of the home crowd, start off divisional play 1-0,” said co-captain Egen Atkinson, citing team defense and a “stellar” performance by senior goalie Nikhil Balaraman as crucial to the win.A successful transition game was another key aspect of Harvard’s victory.  Tallying four goals off of breakaways or odd-man rushes, the team capitalized on several easy scoring opportunities.Atkinson was responsible for two of these, scoring twice in the first two minutes of the second quarter.  30 seconds into the period, the captain harnessed a long pass from the Crimson end and tossed a soft lob over the head of the MIT goalkeeper and into the net.  Just over 30 seconds later, he struck again, taking a feed from Balaraman and burying it in the back of the goal, giving Harvard a 4-1 lead.The first half was closely contested, with Harvard going into halftime leading only by one goal at 5-4.  At halftime, however, the Crimson looked to build on its advantage.“[We] made an adjustment and [the Engineers] were less effective,” Farrar said. “We traded goals for a little while, but we had a big surge.”Indeed, the Harvard defense allowed only two goals in the second half.“We got in a position of control and we didn’t relinquish it,” Farrar said. Voith also added two scores. After giving the Crimson the lead in the first quarter, he struck again as time expired in the third frame, catching a high crossing pass from the left side and firing the ball into the cage.Other scoring contributors were junior Alex Thompson, who scored twice, while junior Jeff Lee, sophomore Luka Babic, and sophomore Evan Zepfel each tallied a goal. Babic scored in particularly dramatic fashion, sprinting down the pool pursued closely by three MIT players before shooting past the Engineer goaltender for Harvard’s first goal.“I think it’s a great step,” Farrar said. “You always want to win your home opener at Harvard.”Farrar praised the team, emphasizing “good hustle” and calling the game a “solid win.”The game was not flawless, though.“It’s still early,” Farrar said. “We’re giving up some situations that we don’t want to be giving up throughout the season...We’re still losing control of the ball.”But Balaraman minimized the damage.“Nikhil was there to clean up the mess on a couple of [the mistakes],” Farrar added.The co-captains agreed on the special satisfaction of beating MIT.“It’s always fun when MIT brings their fans,” Voith said. “It brings an intensity that you have to step up to in that game.”Atkinson echoed his teammate’s sentiment.“All game they had their pots and pans and their heckling,” he said. “I think we did a good job of not letting it get in our heads and sending them home quiet.”The Crimson head back, optimistic and encouraged by their win, to Princeton this weekend to participate in the ECAC Championships.“[MIT] was an important divisional win for us,” concluded Farrar. “But there’s a long way to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College soccer is a tricky sport to follow. It defies the laws of the game mandated by FIFA, with its unlimited substitutions and clock management (running down instead of up). You’ll also never confuse a collegiate match—and its proclivity for long passes to nowhere, atrocious tackling, and inept refereeing—with a European night of Champions League. Brazil circa 1970, this is not. But despite initial misgivings, the collegiate soccer scene is one of surprising regional parity, replete with traditional powerhouses and one-year wonders. And in the midst of a revolutionary shift in American soccer towards a traditional amateur/professional set-up akin to European club soccer, our national team and professional clubs still rely on college soccer as a valuable resource for young talent. But where, you may ask, does the Ivy League rank in all of this? While Ivy teams are traditionally an after-thought in big-time collegiate sports, the league has been resurgent on the soccer landscape over the last few years and looks to once again figure prominently in the post-season discussion this year. Sure, the NCAA College Cup (the annual post-season college tournament) is routinely dominated by teams from the Big East, Pac-10, and ACC. But Ivy teams have become permanent fixtures on weekly soccer rankings and will look to bring at least three teams into the post-season dance for the third year straight. The league also features top players such as Dartmouth’s Craig Henderson (2008 Ivy Player of the Year and member of New Zealand’s U-23 National Team) and the Crimson’s own Andre Akpan (Pre-Season First Team All American and contender for college soccer’s top honor, the Hermann Trophy). With each passing year, the league has become more competitive and this year may prove to be the most exciting one yet. Four teams enter the season with legitimate hopes of winning the title this year, and several players will be looking to receive national accolades as well. Here are some items to follow throughout the year: BEST GAMES OF THE SEASON Oct. 3, Princeton at Dartmouth: The first weekend of the Ivy League campaign showcases defending champions Dartmouth hosting up and comers Princeton. The Tigers boast an array of young talent, and this game will reveal whether they’re up for the challenge or just kittens in disguise. An early slip-up by the Big Green may prove costly for their title ambitions. Oct.17, Brown at Harvard: Brown will be looking to avenge a 4-1 defeat at home last year. Serving as the Crimson’s Ivy home opener, expect the Bears to bring their best, especially if the Crimson remains undefeated to this point. Oct. 24, Princeton at Harvard and Oct. 31, Dartmouth at Harvard: Harvard may be able to lay claim to the Ivy title during these two weeks... or quickly fall out of contention. Back- to-back home dates against two of the top teams in the League will serve as a mid-season gauge for the Crimson and will test the mental resolve of Harvard’s youngest players. The October 31st date with Dartmouth is already shaping up to be a de-facto championship game. Nov. 15, Dartmouth at Brown: Last game of the season for both teams. Major implications for NCAA seeding and possibly the Ivy title if Dartmouth and/or Brown successfully topple the Crimson at home. Both teams also played on the last day of the season last year with Dartmouth winning 2-0 at home. OTHER IVY LEAGUE PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR Daniel Keat, junior midfielder, Dartmouth: The Big Green won the League last year despite missing Keat all of last year with a knee injury. A teammate of Henderson on the U-23 New Zealand team,Keat is fantastic in the air on set pieces and already leads the team in goals (four). Lucky Mkosana, sophomore forward, Dartmouth: The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year will look to improve on his 11 goals and 24 points of last year and once again join the All-Ivy First Team. Dartmouth boasts a formidable attack with Henderson, Keat, and Mkosana and will serve as the Crimson’s chief contenders for the title this season. Nick Elenz-Martin, senior midfielder, Brown: Will be heavily relied upon to control the middle of the pitch for Brown. Elenz-Martin will also be looking to recapture his form from sophomore year, when he was an All-Ivy First Team selection. Paul Grandstand, junior goalkeeper, Brown: Grandstand saw his save percentage decline last year from his stellar Rookie of the Year season in ’07 (0.811 to 0.636) but has gotten off to a fantastic start in ’09 (one goal allowed in four games). Still arguably one of the best keepers in the league when on his game, look for Grandstand to play an integral role in guiding Brown back to the NCAAs and contending for an Ivy title. Antoine Hoppenot, sophomore midfielder, Princeton: All-Ivy Second Team last season, will certainly push for a place on the first team this year. Already has two goals in three games for the season. He will be the catalyst for Princeton’s young armada. PREDICTIONS FOR 2009 WHO’S DANCING AT THE NCAA TOURNAMENT? Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard: Princeton and Penn come close, but will ultimately miss out on post-season play. The Tigers’ young lineup will certainly contend, but road games to Cambridge and Hanover will put the kibosh on any Ivy-title aspirations. The Quakers, co-defending champions, lost quality seniors such as Alex Grendi and Omid Shokoufandeh and will have trouble replacing their goal contributions. Road games to Brown and Harvard at the end of the season also spell trouble for their post-season chances. IVY ROOKIE OF THE YEAR Brian Rogers, Harvard: Rogers has already gotten his Crimson career off to a fine start, scoring 2 goals and 3 assists in four games (coming off the bench in each one). Head Coach Jamie Clark has brought in a stellar freshman class (topped only perhaps by Dartmouth’s) and with it, the best rookie in the league. IVY PLAYER OF THE YEAR Andre Akpan, Harvard: Does the sun rise in the east? Will Kanye West embarrass himself on national TV? Like all things pre-ordained, you could have declared Akpan the 2009 Ivy Player of the Year in his freshman year. After a good, but not great, season (by his standards) last year, Akpan has never looked so determined than he has this season. 11 points in four games (Four goals, three assists), Akpan looks motivated to finally get the Crimson into the sweet six and perhaps further while racking up individual accolades in the process. IVY FINAL TABLE 1. Harvard 2. Dartmouth 3. Brown 4. Princeton 5. Penn 6. Yale 7. Columbia 8. Cornell The season, for all intents and purposes, comes down to that October 31st fixture between Dartmouth and Harvard. The Crimson were blessed by the scheduling gods this season—playing Brown, Princeton, and Dartmouth at home. It seems awfully curious for a Crimson columnist to predict an all-around sweep for Harvard, but Cambridge is a tough place to play at once the winds start changing and the temperatures begin dropping. Beating Boston University and Boston College back-to-back wasn’t an aberration; it was a precursor of sthings to come. —Staff writer Mauricio A. Cruz can be reached at cruz2@fas.harvard.edu.

If ever there was a week to watch Harvard women’s soccer, this is it. Not only is the team capping off a three-game road trip and then playing in a nationally-televised match, but the Crimson is playing two local competitors. Harvard will try to recover from two straight losses as it takes on No. 4 Boston College this Friday in Newton, Mass., at 7 p.m. and Boston University at Nickerson Field this Sunday at 5 p.m. These contests are especially crucial for the Crimson as it tries to improve on its 1-3-1 record. The team fell at Hofstra 3-2 last Sunday, but players were encouraged by an increasing team effort that saw a number of players make an impact. “Over the past couple of games, a lot of different people have contributed,” said senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann. The goalkeeper and other veteran members of the team will be vital in the game against the Eagles, who have outshot their opponents, 152-25. Mann has notched one shutout and a .654 save percentage already this season. Co-captain and fellow senior Lizzy Nichols and junior Katherine Sheeleigh have also contributed one goal and an assist each. But Harvard will also draw on its youth, as freshman forward Caroline Albanese is leading the team in scoring with two goals. Coach Ray Leone recognized the contributions of some of the team’s newest members. “Caroline and Taryn [Kurcz] have done well and will definitely play this weekend,” he said. “Alexandra Conigliaro has been improving steadily as well.” Mann echoed her coach’s sentiments. “It’s exciting to see what some of our newer players can bring to the table,” she said. “This weekend’s going to be a great opportunity for that.” Friday’s game against Boston College will also give the Crimson a chance to prove itself among the college soccer elite. The Eagles have steadily climbed up the rankings to No. 4 in the country with recent wins over Marist and Long Beach State, to whom Harvard lost last Friday. Boston College has started its season with a perfect 6-0 record, and its defense is proving to be nearly impenetrable. It is one of only five teams in the nation to have not allowed a single goal, and among those five has the highest number of goals scored with 24. When asked about the Eagles’ accomplishments, Leone responded, “It’s great for BC. It gives us a better focus, but rankings don’t matter to me. They deserve it, they’re a great team.” The Crimson women have been outshooting their opponents 88-74 this season and will have to keep it up in order to win Friday. Mann assured that the team plans to stick to its guns and not be affected by the BC hype. “It’s business as usual,” she said. “We’re getting a good week of practice in and then taking it to the field.” Last year Harvard fought to an unexpected 1-1 tie against the Eagles, and this Friday it is hoping to pull out the win. If the Crimson succeeds, it will give the team great momentum going into the weekend’s second match against Boston University, which will be televised live on the Fox Soccer Channel. The Terriers (2-3-2) are also coming off consecutive losses, the most recent to No. 23 Penn State at the UConn Classic last Sunday. But they are not to be taken lightly. The team has battled it out with opponents to force three overtime decisions in seven games this season. Harvard has some overtime experience of its own, having tied San Diego State in double overtime in its season opener. These games are also the last before the Crimson makes its Ivy debut against Penn on September 26. If Harvard wants to repeat as league champion, this would be the opportune time to prove itself. With two challenging opponents and a potential turning point for the Crimson women’s soccer season, it will be a crucial weekend for the team—and the local rivalries will make it just as exciting for the fans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For junior Chloe Keating, field hockey has always been a way of life. But it wasn’t until her coaches tried something new that her true talent shone through on the turf.From the very beginning, Keating grew up surrounded by her favorite sport. The Crimson standout’s hometown of Bryn Mawr, Penn. is a field hockey hotspot and, as one of six sisters—all of whom play competitively—Keating seemed destined to pick up a stick.“Field hockey is really big in my area, even more so because I went to Catholic school,” Keating says. “When I was younger, my grade school didn’t even offer soccer.”So it was lacrosse and field hockey for the budding star through high school, a time when Keating proved herself as a natural leader—earning three team MVP honors across the two sports.While Keating showed talent in both sports, field hockey proved to have the stronger pull, and as she looked to continue her career it was a logical step to follow her oldest sister Kristen, class of 2006 to Cambridge.“[Kristen] went through the same program, with the same coaches,” Keating explains. “She really enjoyed her experience here.”Although the sisters did not overlap, Keating thought she learned enough from her sibling to know what to expect from her Harvard experience—four years as a solid midfielder, the position she had played her whole career. But, things have taken a surprising—and beneficial—turn in Keating’s junior season.While teams often carry six or seven forwards in order to produce fresh rotations, Harvard began 2009 with only four, including three freshmen, forcing Crimson coach Sue Caples to shift personnel. With Keating’s flexible skill set, she was a reasonable gamble on the offensive end.“I’ve never really considered myself a forward, because I’ve always had midfield tendencies…being more central and not being as offensively motivated,” Keating reflects. “But I’ve always liked using stick skills and shooting the ball, so I think it was a smart transition to put me up there.”Although the idea came as a surprise to the junior, Keating kept an open mind and has reaped the benefits. After two moderately productive seasons at midfield, in which Keating notched 14 points over seven starts, the newly-minted forward has exploded in her third year, shredding opposing defenses like a veteran.“[Keating] has brought a lot of energy and intensity to the forward line,” co-captain Kristin Bannon says. “She has an eye for the net and loves to score.”Only three games into the season, Keating has satisfied her love of goal-scoring early and often. Armed with the quick hands necessary to control the ball at midfield, the junior star has emerged as an excellent presence in the circle, responsible for deftly deflecting Crimson shots out of reach of opposing goalies.“[Keating] is a great tipper,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon praises. “She always has her stick in there, always gets a touch on any shot, aond can put it in the net…she’s developed into a real goal scorer with a lot of poise.”The junior’s increased involvement has led to an offensive flurry. Keating has notched five goals and four assists—best on the squad in both categories—en route to matching her career total with 14 points. With the introduction of such a prolific scoring threat after struggling offensively in recent years, it is no surprise that Harvard is off to its first 3-0 start since 2005.“It’s incredibly important having Chloe up [at forward],” Goodman-Bacon says. “Even amidst the [personnel rotation] and illnesses, it has allowed us to generate the offense we need.”Keating showed particular excitement for the team’s offensive resurgence because it takes pressure off of what was once a much-beleaguered defense. In the standout’s first two seasons, Harvard averaged just 1.7 and 1.47 goals per game, versus 4.0 so far in 2009.“[In the past] we’ve really depended on the consistency of our defense,” Keating explains. “Games we should have been winning 4-0 or 5-0 we were winning 1-0 or 2-0… We’ve finally begun to depend on forwards and midfielders to score and generate more consistent offense in order to win games. It’s fun being a part of that offense and that type of scoring mentality.”And without question, Keating represents the lynchpin of this suddenly dynamic attack. Yet the junior, ever humble about her recent stardom, credits her teammates and the playbook for her newfound success.“A lot of my goals have been completely generated by the good passing of players off the corners,” says Keating, who occupies the left tipper position on penalty corners. “Most teams typically guard the right side thinking that most people will innately go there, so we’ve focused a lot of our plays on going left.”While many factors seem to contribute to the junior’s strong season, they all point to a common conclusion—Keating is poised to continue shining for the rest of her Harvard career.“She’s a confident player,” Goodman-Bacon says. “She came in confident and it has only grown.”But while things may be rapidly changing for Keating as she rises from role player to offensive superstar, the most important aspects of field hockey remain the same, including the joy of sharing her favorite sport with those closest to her. After spending her first 18 years surrounded by a field hockey-focused family, Keating has transitioned easily into the family of Crimson field hockey.“It’s nice to kind of have a core group of people that you’re always involved with,” Keating says. “I’ve really enjoyed every aspect of the program from the beginning. My teammates are my best friends here so it’s been a really great experience overall.”The junior standout also does not take for granted the role her sibling has played in paving the way for her time at Harvard, as evidenced by her jersey number—the same 24 worn by Kristen for four years.And after devoting so many seasons to the same sport, among her sisters and her teammates, Keating is finally experiencing the benefits of both diligent work and an open mind. If her torrid start to life as a forward is any indication, the athlete who has always been part of a field hockey family now has the chance to create a legacy all her own.—Staff writer Max N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football fans are a spoiled bunch these days. In the Crimson’s two-year run as Ivy League champion, the Harvard faithful could trek across the river five weekends a year and pretty much know what to expect: an athletic, aggressive, veteran defense; a well-rounded offense bolstered by a stalwart line, dependable backs, and gifted wideouts; and, of course, Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09. After cementing himself as the Crimson’s starting quarterback in 2008, Pizzotti returned for a fifth year last season and torched the opposition, throwing for 2,490 yards and 17 touchdowns en route to winning the Ivy League Player of the Year Award. But just because it felt like Pizzotti was around forever doesn’t mean that he was, or that he was going to be. He’s gone now, and in his wake is a gaping hole under center that Harvard will try to fill with a variety of intriguing, if unknown, commodities, from junior Collier Winters down the depth chart to freshman Colton Chapple. If there’s any silver lining in this less than ideal predicament, it’s that the rest of the Ivy League is going through exactly the same thing. In the Ancient Eight, only Yale, Columbia and Dartmouth field quarterbacks who threw over 100 passes last season, and there’s not one signal caller in the league whom you could call a legitimate star. That’s not to say one won’t emerge, and as we run through the weekend slate in this first edition of Around the Ivies, we’ll take a close look at which QB’s could become true field generals, and which should go back to cleaning latrines, or at least holding a clipboard on the sidelines. CORNELL VS. BUCKNELL I’m going to miss Nathan Ford. One of my favorite athletes in the Ivy League—not only was Ford an exciting quarterback for the Big Red who would routinely throw up 60 or so passes in a game, he was also a devastating slugger on Cornell’s baseball team. Not to mention that Dwight name-dropped him on “The Office.” Now that Ford’s graduated, former JV starter turned varsity benchwarmer Ben Ganter will take the snaps for Cornell while the guy who might be the team’s best quarterback, Stephen Liuzza, is playing wide receiver. Go figure. Prediction: Bucknell 21, Cornell 17. DARTMOUTH VS. COLGATE Even as far as losers go, Dartmouth is a hard team to love. But in keeping in line with the theme of this column, I will say this: the Big Green is pretty stable at quarterback. Alex Jenny showed a modest degree of talent last season, and that’s enough to get him the starting job this year. Good for him. Unfortunately, while the defense is on the field Jenny will be stuck watching Colgate’s Greg Sullivan, a versatile QB with a rocket for an arm and jets on his legs. Bold prediction: Sullivan gains more yards rushing than Jenny does throwing. Not So Bold Prediction: Colgate 34, Dartmouth 10. YALE AT GEORGETOWN As difficult as it is to lavish a Yalie with platitudes, I have to say I like new Bulldogs coach Tom Williams. The former Jacksonville Jaguars assistant took over the team from Jack Siedlecki and immediately put a fire in his players by declaring every roster spot open to competition, including quarterback. So while Brook Hart played well in a platoon with the graduated Ryan Fodor last year, he’ll have to withstand a challenge from sophomore transfer Patrick Witt—brother of former Harvard quarterback Jeff Witt—if he wants the starting job all to himself. Prediction: Yale 28, Georgetown 14. PRINCETON VS. THE CITADEL Some guy named Tommy Wornham will get the starting nod behind center for the Tigers, but it really doesn’t matter. Princeton running back Jordan Culbreath was the best player in the Ancient Eight not named Pizzotti last season, rushing for 1244 yards and 10 touchdowns, and he’s as good a pick as any for Ivy League Player of the Year this time around. Prediction: Princeton 31, Citadel 27.BROWN AT STONY BROOK Like Harvard, Brown lost its star quarterbac

Monday marked the launch of ESPN Boston, an offshoot of the popular sports network's website devoted entirely to the group of fanatics self-anointed the "Red Sox Nation" (To be clear, the site covers all things Boston sports, but if you are a Bostonian who doesn't align with Red Sox Nation you just aren't jumping on the bandwagon hard enough).
Flyby rejoiced over the new site after stumbling across a preview in which Harvard's hallowed shield was displayed prominently on the header of the home page. But, apparently laying claim to Boston's oldest football, basketball, hockey, and baseball teams doesn't buy you much love. Read on after the jump to see what went wrong.
Much to Flyby's disappointment,  ESPN Boston launched with the Harvard logo nowhere in sight. What had the University done to engender such disrespect? Paul Melvin of ESPN communications had this to say in an email,
Okay, so rest assured Crimson fans, ESPN Boston will occasionally rotate out the Patriots in favor of the red and white H...
While it remains to be seen how much visibility Harvard will in fact enjoy on the home page, Melvin assured Flyby that ESPN's Crimson coverage would not be lacking.
Flyby genuinely hopes that this is the case, because as of now Boston College is the only school with spot on the header, and we all remember why Harvard>BC>UNC.

The New Haven police's sole "person of interest" in the Yale murder case—lab technician Ray Clark, 24—was arrested around 8:30 a.m. this morning at a Super 8 Motel in Cromwell, CT, and charged with murder. The police has taken him to the New Haven police headquarters in an unmarked police car, and he's expected to be arraigned within the next 24 hours. Clark's bond is set at $3 million, and Chief James Lewis did not designate a motive beyond “an issue of workplace violence.”
DNA tests at a state lab confirmed a link between Clark and Yale medical student Annie Le's murder on Wednesday, and an arrest was clear to be imminent by late Wednesday night, New Haven police spokesman Joe Avery said at the time. Clark was the last person to see Le alive, computer records confirmed on Wednesday. The 24-year-old Vietnamese-American student was strangled to death and found stuffed behind a wall on Sunday—the same day she was supposed to be married to her longtime boyfriend.
The police stopped short of calling Clark a suspect when they detained him on Tuesday to obtain DNA samples and searched his apartment. They released him from custody around 3 a.m. on Wednesday, when he subsequently fled to a Super 8 Motel less than 10 miles away from Middletown, CT, where he has been living in an apartment with his fiancee. The police surrounded the motel on Wednesday and were closely monitoring it.
The New York Times' profiles of both Annie Le and Ray Clark are tragic and worth reading. Meanwhile, Gawker has dug up Clark's old MySpace profile and other details on Clark, including that he complained to Le through e-mail about the way she was treating lab mice.

Tragic news broke today that Harvard Square has completed its slow turn toward gentrification with the impending shuttering of Herrell's ice-cream store on Dunster street. The Crimson's Athena Jiang reports that the owner cited rising food costs, sky high rent, and of course, JP Licks for their mounting financial woes.
Without starting an ice cream war, Flyby would like to offer this: We'll miss sharing a cup of "Happy Couple" ice cream in Herrell's wonderfully sketchy vault, or finding that you happened to walk in when your favorite combination of peanut butter, chocolate and caramel was being offered on the menu.
If you don't know what we're talking about, go get a cup before Herrell's closes--perhaps as soon as November. Farewell, we will miss you old friend.

Disturbing fact of the day: 41% of college students know of someone (which includes themselves) who has slept with a professor or teacher's assistant. Talk about a teacher's pet.
According to the Playboy College Sex Poll 2009, 43% of college students have sex weekly (while a more vital set of 15% hit the bed daily), and 17% are virgins.
Did you know that 37% of males prefer a woman with a Brazilian? A geometrically-minded 5% like the Triangle. 14% are more into the au natural look of the Full. But 26% just don't care. That's FlyBy's kind of man—apathy, my friends, makes life so much easier.
The esteemed intellectual stimulator, Playboy, polled more than 5,000 college students to find out what percentage of higher education constituents engaged in specific acts of low, hearty fun. See more of the steamy stats after the jump.
FlyBy will deliver the goods in order of most positive responses:
But Playboy has a heartening message for the more chaste individuals in the audience, you females who dream of yonder days of chivalry over your chemistry tomes, hoping that a man will love you solely for your beautiful soul: 73% of college students have gone on a dinner-and-movie date.
Granted, they might have finished the night with less innocent activities, but that's still almost six times more than the percentage of students who routinely have anal sex (13%).

Strolling through the Yard this morning, Flyby noticed what appeared to be many, many dark brown nuggets of feces strewn all over the grass—almost as if a flock of migrating geese had decided that John Harvard's turf was ideal for defecating on, and then took to spreading the joy through the Yard in nice, straight lines.
But really: was the tractor rampaging through the Yard simply carrying out another organic fertilization, or did President Faust decide that the colorful chairs need some New England farmland-style company?
Read Yard Ops' explanation after the jump.
Zak Gingo, director of facilities maintenance and operations for the FAS Office of Physical Resources, said the machine is actually a "ground aerator," which "pulls out little plugs of dirt" in order to allow air and water to get to the roots of the grass. The clumps will break down and be reabsorbed into the lawn in short time, he said.
Alright, we'll take that.

We have to admit, when we first heard about Facebook Lite, our hearts jumped. Could it be a return to simpler times? Could it be, finally, an alternative Facebook site for those of us who think the current feeds, apps, widgets, and whatnots aren't worth the migraine?
Well, don't get too excited. The answer is no. While the sign-in page hypes the beta site as a faster, easier way to "share your life with your friends and family," it is not, in fact, a return to the glory days of thefacebook.com. For better or worse, all the current features are still there (except for the ability to filter your home page's feed).
Instead, the site focuses on presentation, eliminating a lot of the noise on the sides of the screen and cranking up the font like those large print versions of books that your grandparents like. To reduce clutter, Facebook Lite erases many redundancies: For example, in regular Facebook, you can find your upcoming events on your home page, on your profile, and on the ever-present toolbar at the bottom of the browser. Get an invitation? Now there's an additional link to that on your home page. In Facebook Lite, there's just one big events button at the top.
One change we especially like is the way photo comments are next to pictures instead of under them. Not having to scroll down to see the thread makes for more efficient procrastination.
Considering how minor the differences are, though, we don't really see Facebook Lite taking off any time soon.

Electrical fires. Near collisions. Passenger injuries. Potential fare hikes and service reductions.
FlyBy wonders if there's any incentive whatsoever to continue riding the T, or if we should all just start cabbing it to Boston instead.
An electrical fire between Downtown Crossing and South Station crippled service on the Red Line during rush hour yesterday, according to the MBTA's Twitter Web site, forcing hundreds of passengers to evacuate the subway. Service wasn't restored until at least 9 p.m., and the MBTA's substitute shuttle buses caused delays and traffic jams in Harvard Square.
At about the same time, a fire broke out on the Orange Line—possibly prompted by a passenger throwing debris onto the third rail near the Chinatown stop—and stopped service on that route as well.
Learn more about the delays, and other MBTA debacles, after the jump.
The Mass. Secretary of Transportation told the Boston Globe last night that the two fires were a "perfect storm," coming one after another, and that workers had done the best they could to handle the situation. But the MBTA seems to be swamped with trouble lately.
A commuter rail train hit a metal back stop on Tuesday—injuring 18 people—and two other trains nearly collided on Monday. And in May, two Green Line trolleys collided and injured dozens because the operator was text messaging.
Over the summer, the MBTA announced that it was considering fare hikes and service reductions to help eliminate the agency's $180 million budget deficit and $5 billion debt. But Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick '78 has suspended planned public discussions on the service changes, and it's unclear if the proposals are still on the table.
MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told FlyBy that a decision about how to proceed with service changes won't be made before November.
