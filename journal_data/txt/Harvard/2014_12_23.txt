Tony Award-winning musical “Into the Woods” will soon become the next major Broadway hit to cross over onto the silver screen. Rob Marshall (“Chicago”) directs with a screenplay penned by James Lapine, co-writer of the original musical with Stephen Sondheim. The film’s ensemble cast includes Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, and Johnny Depp.
“Into the Woods” takes place in a fairytale world where the characters and plots of several Brothers Grimm fairy tales intersect. When a Baker (Corden) and his Wife (Blunt) are cursed by an evil Witch (Streep), they must journey into the woods to break the spell. Kendrick, of Broadway and “Pitch Perfect” fame, plays Cinderella, with Pine (“Star Trek”) cast opposite as her Prince.
Kendrick thinks the film adaptation will resonate with audiences of all backgrounds due to the universality of the story. “I think that thematically, the whole piece is really about parents and children and the disappointments of parents and the failings of parents, and it’s based on stories that parents have told their children for generations,” Kendrick says. “But there’s the element where it’s pure fantasy and it’s exciting for kids, and then there’s an element that’s really specifically centered towards parents. Which is, we have to be careful what we tell our children and children take lessons to heart, and it’s about understanding that they’re listening to us even if it doesn’t feel that way.”
Pine approached the film from a unique perspective, having recently starred in two “Star Trek” films and the recent reboot of Tom Clancy’s “Jack Ryan” series—all blockbuster action films. He also brings a level of musical talent to the film—Pine previously performed an original country song titled “Someday Came Today” for the 2010 film “Small Town Saturday Night.” “[The film] was a lot of fun, and it was totally different than what I had done before,” says Pine.
“The musical theater genre is very specific, and the sound that you’re going for is obviously quite different than something like the country music I did before. But I had a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of the technique and of the genre, and I had a lot of incredibly talented people who had worked in this medium before, from Anna to Meryl and Christine [Baranski].” Filming “Into the Woods” was also a different experience for Kendrick. “We’re singing pop music in ‘Pitch Perfect’ and we’re singing Sondheim in this, so I was petrified and excited. It was an unbelievable challenge, but obviously singing Sondheim is so rewarding and fulfilling, and it was just a dream come true,” says Kendrick.
Kendrick, Pine, and the rest of the cast of “Into the Woods” arrive in theaters with their dark fairy tale on Christmas Day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, many Harvard alumni continued their professional sports seasons on the ice, on the court, and on the field. Meanwhile, one alum’s season came to an unfortunate close.
In the second quarter of an NFL game between Houston and Indianapolis last weekend, Texans quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 suffered a fractured leg while attempting to scramble. Fitzpatrick had been enjoying one of the best seasons of his career, posting 17 touchdowns and eight interceptions through 12 games. Houston is currently 8-7.
Elsewhere in the NFL, fullback Kyle Juszcyk ’13 is in the middle of a playoff race as well. Playing for the 9-6 Baltimore Ravens, Juszyck made one reception for four yards but lost a fumble in a 20-12 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars this past Saturday. After sitting out in the team’s one-point loss to the San Diego Chargers due to a foot injury, Juszcyk has played the last three games, averaging a mere 2.3 yards per reception. The fullback faced off against Fitzpatrick’s team this Sunday, but the Ravens fell to the Texans, 25-13.
In the NHL, center Alex Killorn ’12 played 35 cumulative minutes in the Tampa Bay Lightning’s three games this past week—two losses against the Capitals and Penguins, and a win against the Flyers. The Haliax, Nova Scotia native matched his season-high with six shots on Monday in the team’s 4-2 loss to the Penguins.
On the basketball court, point guard Jeremy Lin ’10, having just lost his starting position on the Lakers, scored only two points in the team’s 110-91 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Monday. Since then, however, the point guard has recorded 16 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists over his last two games.

Although the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team has paused its competitive season until January 10th, senior diver Mike Mosca has not stopped working. While most swimmers and divers were finishing up exams and heading home for the holidays, Mosca was competing at the U.S. Diving Winter National Championships this Sunday in Columbus, Ohio.
Mosca represented his team well with his performance, finishing in the top five in the three-meter synchronized dive alongside his partner, University of North Carolina sophomore Jack Nyquist. The pair finished with a fifth place score of 378.51 points, which was enough to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Trials.
Last year when Mosca competed at the Championships with Nyquist, the duo finished in ninth place with a score of 706.44. In 2012, Mosca finished sixth in the three-meter synchronized dive.
Nyquist currently holds the one-meter diving record for the Tar Heels with a score of 398.30, while he sits in second all-time in the three-meter with a score of 436.58.
Individually at the National Championships, Mosca placed 24th in the one-meter dive and 15th in the three-meter contest, though he had already qualified for the Olympic Trials in the three-meter based on his opening round score.
This accomplishment only adds to Mosca’s long list of diving achievements, most notably the titles he has won at Harvard. The Crimson has been crowned Ivy League Champion in the one-meter dive his freshman, sophomore, and junior years as well as the three-meter dive his sophomore and junior seasons. Mosca is currently the Harvard record holder in the one-meter with a score of 387.05 and the three-meter with a score of 412.42.
And Mosca’s accomplishments this year don’t stop in the pool. The History and Science concentrator was also named a Rhodes Scholar Finalist earlier this fall.
Mosca and the Crimson compete next on January 10th in a tri-meet against Duke and South Carolina.
