Editors' Note: The Harvard Art Museums are closed due to COVID-19 for the foreseeable future. This article was written before the closure.
Rachel M. Saunders is the Harvard Art Museums’ Curator of Asian Art and co-curator of the “Painting Edo” exhibition, the largest temporary exhibit in the museum’s history. Saunders spoke with The Harvard Crimson about the exhibit and Edo painting.
The Harvard Crimson: What were your goals with “Painting Edo”?
Rachel M. Saunders: What was really important to me was not just that we would present a history of early modern painting in Japan, but that we recreate a space where people could have the opportunity to experience seeing differently. We all operate in these kind of habituated frames of reference, whether they're visual or intellectual, whatever they are, and we’re often not aware of them… The way that Edo paintings are constructed is so different than the way contemporary paintings in Europe would have been. They have one set of rules and Edo painting has another set of rules. It's appreciating those without making value judgments that's so important.
THC: What are the rules of Edo painting?
RMS: In dealing with early modern Japanese painting there's a massive variety of different styles, different types of painting, and different materials. We have people painting in just ink on paper and very simple materials. There's Literati painting, which is meant to have an amateur aesthetic, even if the painters weren't amateurs... On the other end of the scale, you've got professional painting from people like the Kano school who were painting for patrons who specifically want paintings that reflect their power and their status. There's gold, a lot of expensive blues and greens. And they're usually commissioned by a subject that reflects what they want to see. These paintings are both reflecting something of the world that they're producing and also constructing worlds. They do the two things at the same time. That's why we call [the exhibition] "Painting Edo." It's supposed to be a little bit of a playful riff on that idea that paintings create worlds as well as reflect them…
If you are an Edo specialist, you'll notice that some of the subject headings in the exhibition look different than you would probably expect. But that's because we were trying to go back to contemporary notions of what it meant to be a Literati painter or painter who followed Korōn.
THC: Why did the Edo period see such a large shift in Japanese painting?
RMS: In the Edo period, we're experiencing new technologies, things like the microscope and the telescope. Suddenly, a tiny insect becomes a giant monster, or stars become visible in a different way. The universe changes. There's another movement that's important, both historically and scientifically; in Japanese it's called honzogaku. It gets translated as medical botany. Of course, there have been studies of plants forever in Asia and Europe… We did an event with the keeper of living collections. His name was Michael Dosmann. He looks at paintings a very different way than I do… what the keeper of living collections at the operation noticed when he looked at the screen was, “goodness, I could teach a whole class on taxa from this screen!” They don't look particularly realistic. But then he looked at them and said, “No, the person who painted this really knew these parts because they're capturing all the features of the technical features very carefully.”
THC: What can modern viewers learn from Edo painting?
RMS: I am a very strong believer in the fact that you do not need to use only what was produced in the last 20 years to talk about contemporary issues. Because we are the here and now, we have our interactions with these paintings here. In the contemporary moment, we can still experience beyond ourselves and beyond our own moment in time without using contemporary art.

UPDATED: November 2, 2021 at 12:00 a.m.
Practitioners of the ancient Japanese art “kintsugi” piece together shards of pottery with metallic lacquer, turning unsightly fault lines into shimmering channels of silver and gold. American alt-rock band Death Cab for Cutie’s eighth studio album, released five years ago, shares its namesake’s goal of finding beauty in the broken.
Like its ceramic counterpart, Death Cab for Cutie’s “Kintsugi” grows out of assorted fragments. Each of the album’s 11 tracks offers a transient meditation on nostalgia and regret, held together not by gold varnish but by frontman Ben Gibbard’s mellow voice — golden in its own right.

Gibbard, who confronts his circumstances with realism and acceptance on “Kintsugi,” offers listeners a message of renewal when despair seems close at hand. The album’s opener, “No Room in Frame,” offers a harrowing assessment of a relationship gone awry: “And we’ll both go on and get lonely with someone else,” Gibbard predicts. But his tone is not one of malice or anger; rather, he acknowledges the inevitability of the split and finds the strength to move forward.

The next track, “Black Sun,” reaffirms the existence of a silver lining. “There is an answer in a question / And there is hope within despair / And there is beauty in a failure,” begins the second verse. But Gibbard stops short of pure idealism, acknowledging the difficulty of compassion: “And there is grace within forgiveness / But it’s so hard for me to find.” Gibbard’s recognition of his own shortcomings humanizes his messages.

On a more personal scale, Gibbard reflects on the quirks of memory and loss. No matter how much he tries to leave his past behind, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to it. “I don’t know why, I don’t know why / I return to the scenes of these crimes,” he sings on “The Ghosts of Beverly Drive,” an uptempo track about his former life in Los Angeles.

The rest of the album touches on both emotional and geographic isolation. “Little Wanderer” is a wistfully expectant exploration of the latter, with Gibbard realizing the logistical challenges of going long-distance: “Doing the math to the time zone you're at / Is an unseen part of the plan.” He also notes a cruel irony unique to modern times, as the very technology designed to bring Gibbard and his partner closer together only emphasizes the distance between them. “But I couldn’t make you out through the glitches… So we say our goodbyes over Messenger / As the network overloads,” he recounts.

Technology reappears as a central motif in the final track, “Binary Sea,” in which Gibbard speculates about a future where the traces of his data across the world’s computers are the only remaining proof of his existence.

Given the acuity of his observations on “Kintsugi,” Gibbard was well aware of his band’s relationship with isolation well before it became a hallmark of the present. In an interview with Billboard shortly after the album’s release, Gibbard explained Death Cab for Cutie’s appeal. “People turn to us because they don't want to feel alone in their melancholic moments,” he said. "And I'm happy to provide that soundtrack."

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Gibbard and his bandmates are once again delivering “that soundtrack.” On Mar. 16, Gibbard announced that he would livestream daily concerts from home to thank and reassure his fans. In a letter he posted to social media, Gibbard described the current situation as a “nightmare” and stated his awareness of our collective fear and loneliness. “I know it has left us all incredibly isolated,” he wrote of recommended social distancing measures.

“Hey, what’s goin’ on, y’all?” Gibbard asked viewers on Mar. 17 as the first livestream began. He then launched into a soulful rendition of “We Will Become Silhouettes,” a single he released with his former band The Postal Service. The song’s opening lines matched the context of the performance with uncanny accuracy: “I’ve got a cupboard with cans of food / Filtered water, and pictures of you / And I’m not coming out until this is all over.”

The livestream featured fan favorites from Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service, along with a cover of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees.” After the last song — The Postal Service’s “The District Sleeps Alone Tonight” — Gibbard urged viewers to take care of themselves and each other. A deluge of enthusiastic comments replaced applause, and the screen went dark.

The next day, Gibbard started his livestream with “No Room in Frame.” During what would have been a lush instrumental break with backup from his bandmates, he vocalized the melody over softly strummed chords. In a way, his improvisation embodied the soul of kintsugi: turning something incomplete into its own work of art.

The world may be in pieces. But, as Death Cab for Cutie have shown time and again, it’s never beyond repair.
CORRECTION: November 1, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated that Kintsugi was Death Cab for Cutie’s second studio album. In fact, it is its eighth studio album.

The Dixie Chicks all but fell off the face of the earth after lead singer Natalie Maines told a London audience that they disagreed with President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq on Mar. 10, 2003. After that fateful day, the whole of country music decided to blacklist the all-female country pop group. Country radio banned them from the airwaves with virtual unanimity, fans trashed their CDs, and what was once the best selling U.S. female band of all time stopped making music for 14 years.
But after rumors the Dixie Chicks were releasing new music emerged following their feature on Taylor Swift’s 2019 song “Soon You’ll Get Better,” the group came out with a new single, “Gaslighter.” With it, they announced a forthcoming album of the same name.
“Gaslighter, denier / Doin' anything to get your ass farther / Gaslighter, big timer / Repeating all of the mistakes of your father,” the trio begins, all singing a capella, forcing the “gaslighter” to listen and listen closely. The song takes no prisoners as the Dixie Chicks call out Maines’s ex-husband Adrian Pasdar for crime after crime. “I believed in the promises you made to me / Swore that night 'til death do us part / But you lie-lie-lie-lie-lied,” Maines sings, her voice cutting through the song’s upbeat guitar strumming.
At every chorus, all three members join their voices to criticize the gaslighter, creating a sense of solidarity. The instrumentation, too, contributes to this strength as the guitar and bass drum become more incessant with each of Maines’s attacks, only to fall away as she addresses the gaslighter one last time. “Gaslighter, I'm your mirror / Standin' right here until you can see how you broke me / Yeah, I'm broken / You're still sorry, and there's still no apology,” she sings lightly, accompanied only by the song’s silence before being again joined by the rest of the band for the final chorus.
For fans of the Dixie Chicks, the track has that same rebellious energy of songs like “There’s Your Trouble” and “Not Ready To Make Nice.” It is already one more of their scathingly unapologetic anthems. But its standing as their comeback single after more than a decade of being wholly ignored makes it all the more powerful. The Dixie Chicks are back, and with “Gaslighter,” they show that they are just as ready to stand up for themselves as they’ve ever been.

By all accounts, the spring of 2020 should have been a tremendous time to be a sports fan. The Masters Tournament. Wimbledon. March Madness. Baseball’s Opening Day. The 2020 Olympic Games. Every event a time-honored tradition — eagerly anticipated by fans across the world — and each so tantalizingly close.
The ongoing NHL and NBA seasons, too, offered fans an embarrassment of riches. The race for the Stanley Cup was as wide-open as ever, with many of the league’s preeminent teams poised to make runs at the championship. The season up to that point had featured all the goals, grit, and glory we’ve come to expect from hockey — as well as the unforgettable moment when 43-year-old zamboni driver, kidney transplant recipient, and emergency goalie David Ayres played between the pipes for the Carolina Hurricanes en route to an improbable win over the Toronto Maple Leafs in his professional debut. In basketball, rookies like Zion Williamson and Ja Morant seized the spotlight as they vied for playoff spots, while LeBron James — the sport’s foremost superstar — sought to carry his Lakers and the city of Los Angeles to an NBA title in the wake of the tragic passing of LA icon Kobe Bryant.
None of this would matter after Mar. 11 — when a seemingly routine match between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder alerted the sports world, and America at large, to the very real arrival of a pandemic. Initially, nothing seemed amiss. While ESPN play-by-play announcers discussed how the Jazz would deal with the absence of their star center Rudy Gobert and players conferred with coaches in anticipation of the game, it slowly became clear that something was delaying the start of the contest. Suddenly, the two teams left the court and headed to their respective locker rooms. A voice over the arena loudspeaker told fans that the game had been postponed, and that they should all leave as soon as possible. It turns out that just prior to tip-off, a team doctor ran (yes, literally ran) onto the court to tell the officials that Rudy Gobert, the same Rudy Gobert missing the game due to “illness,” had tested positive for COVID-19.
In the next few days, the NBA would postpone the rest of its season indefinitely. The NHL soon followed suit. Next, the NCAA cancelled spring sports, including March Madness. The MLB postponed its season, the Masters Tournament was pushed back, Wimbledon was cancelled, and the IOC has taken the virtually unprecedented step of postponing the Olympic Games — a time-honored tradition that had only ever been cancelled due to World Wars.
As dramatic as it feels to say, sports fans have found their very lifestyles altered. For devotees, sports offer more than entertainment — they form an integral part of a daily routine. Sports media, like all media, can provoke and inspire, but it can also recede into comforting background noise, providing a sense of normalcy no matter what might be going on in the larger world. When COVID-19 managed to upend this dependable source of entertainment, it was a sign of its undeniable disruptiveness. The millions around the world who spent their free time listening to sports talk radio, watching ESPN, or scrolling through Twitter looking for free agency news and trade rumors quickly learned the meaning of the Joni Mitchell lyric “You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone.”
Media outlets are trying desperately to fill the void with extensive previews of forthcoming competitions and reruns of “classic” games, but they can only paper over the cracks for so long. Viewers aside, team owners, television network executives, players, stadium employees, and anybody else whose work revolves around professional athletics has been hit hard, and most are scrambling to cope financially with tremendous revenue losses while also — somewhat admirably — using their platform to help guide the public through trying times. Gobert, who had ironically mocked the disease before his diagnosis, took to social media to apologize extensively and urge others to take the virus seriously.
Unfortunately, what these media outlets cannot possibly compensate for is the fact that sports are more than just reliable. They are communal and, especially in times of crisis, inspiring. Sports strengthen our relationships by compelling us to invest considerable effort and energy into something which often rewards that investment. On the surface they may appear to have little inherent value beyond their capacity to entertain — but sports are a phenom because, for whatever reason, people care enough to make them one. Events like the Super Bowl, the World Cup, and the Olympics capture national attention and bring communities together like nothing else.
Consider Boston, Massachusetts on April 20, 2013, about a week after bombs exploded at the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon. Patriot’s Day, a beloved Boston holiday featuring the marathon as well as Red Sox baseball, had been tainted by an act of unfathomable cruelty. As the city locked down over the course of the next week while police searched for the terrorists responsible, the Red Sox became a rallying point for Bostonians. At the forefront of the #BostonStrong movement, the Sox returned to Fenway Park on the Saturday after the bombing for a home game against the Kansas City Royals. David Ortiz, already a Red Sox legend, took the field before the game with a microphone in his hand and uttered a sentence that would effectively reclaim Boston from tragedy: “This is our fucking city, and nobody’s gonna dictate our freedom.” The proclamation, emanating from the man who had broken the Curse of the Bambino and restored hope to Red Sox Nation, brought the city to life. He would go on to lift the city even further out of tragedy by leading the team to another World Series title, turning in one of the greatest individual performances in MLB postseason history in the process. A team that had finished in last place in their division the year before rallied around the #BostonStrong movement to deliver a championship to the city that needed it most.
Sports will come back. Basketball and football and hockey players will, eventually, return to their courts and fields and rinks, and the billions of fans across the world will, eventually, have something to cheer for again. In the meantime, we will have to bear its absence — and in a time when our only hope of combating a global pandemic is by being apart from each other, this is a sacrifice we have to make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Harvard students,
I imagine you are beginning to adapt and find new routines as we have moved our world and interactions online. Typically, April is a busy month for us at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, as we observe Sexual Assault Awareness Month with keynote speakers, workshops, social media campaigns, in-person gatherings, the iconic Harvard Wears Denim day (which our Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators expertly organize every year), and Our Voices (a student-led performance organized in partnership with OSAPR).
This April, social distancing and the isolation of our current reality have challenged our OSAPR team to imagine different engagement strategies with our community. We have invested much time and effort in developing our social media engagement and online resources as well as structuring a series of online events, from Yoga for Restoration to Lunch and Learn sessions and Netflix and Chill with OSAPR. Nonetheless, we miss all of you; we miss the formal and informal conversations, the interactions at Communities of Care events, and all the tea you spill when you come to the office (figuratively and literally).
Our conversations as an office have also made us think of the many challenges you might be experiencing. We are all isolated at this moment in time, but that doesn’t mean we have to go through the challenges alone. If you don’t read any further, I want you to know that OSAPR is still available, our hotline is operational 24/7, and our staff can meet with those who wish to reach out.
Many of you, I imagine, now find yourselves in long-distance relationships, having to navigate the stresses of social distancing, classes, and communication with a partner who might be thousands of miles away. You might be balancing the need to “be there” for your partner and your own need to tend to yourself or disconnect from a world that is heavily dependent on virtual connection. Long-distance relationships can be challenging in non-pandemic times; our current reality adds a new layer of complexity. Similarly, many of you might be dealing with the stresses and difficulties that come from living with others, whether they be family members or friends. Such stress can strain our relationships and make us feel further alienated. Remember: We are here for you. Our services continue to be free, confidential, and non-judgmental.
I also recognize that the heightened dependence on technology raises a number of questions about how we interact with each other online. Is someone taking a screenshot of me while I’m in a Zoom class? Am I texting too much? Am I texting enough? How do I increase the security and privacy of the technology and apps I use? Those are questions we often receive at OSAPR, but our current online dependence has heightened people’s awareness of these issues. During the next few days, we will develop tips and resources around these and related topics, but in the meantime, I encourage people to visit our Tech Safety page. At these times — and really, always — it’s important to be reminded of two tenets of healthy relationships, romantic or otherwise: open communication and mutual respect. I encourage you to think about communicating your boundaries and respecting others’ spaces, to observe consent in your interactions, and to uphold your relationships with care and respect.
Lastly, please remember to take care of yourselves in ways that feel right to you. For some of us, taking care of ourselves might mean disconnecting from the virtual world; for others, it might mean baking cookies, singing in the shower, or not giving in to the pressure of “accomplishing” more during this pandemic. This is all okay. We are living in stressful and uncertain times, and we will all respond or cope differently. Just remember: the social distancing and isolation need not equate to dealing with this alone.
You might find yourselves in different time zones and thousands of miles away but remember that Harvard resources like OSAPR are still available for you. Our mission is to reduce sexual assault and interpersonal harm as well as to create communities that care for each other. That mission extends beyond the confines of Cambridge and well into the summer. We are here for you.
Pierre R. Berastain ’10 is the director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Monday morning, early this semester, I sat in Emerson Hall and listened to the always charismatic Professor Cornel R. West ’74 speak about Beyoncé. Though he has updated his opinion on her slightly, he noted that he had previously said Beyoncé puts on a “superficial spectacle” typical of pop music today. “Beyoncé can move,” he once said, “but Aretha Franklin needed only a microphone to thrill an audience.”
I saw some major truths in that statement. No, I am not just poking the “beehive” with this. It’s not only Beyoncé. It’s Drake; it’s Kanye; it’s Migos. It’s in pop, hip-hop, R&B, trap, rap — I mean really take your pick. It’s everyone … yet, I still don’t share Professor West’s cynicism. Here’s why.
The entire last few generations of major black music artists are in question here. They have all drawn criticism for making music that doesn’t speak to anything. Music that has no purpose apart from commercial fame and monetary gain. And sure, everyone is fond of the music they grew up with, so any criticism of music that starts with some variation of “back in my day” needs to be taken with about a tablespoon of salt.
Yet, I can’t help feeling that there’s a grain of truth in what they are saying about the current biggest artists. It’s hard not to notice that in this column I referenced Nina Simone’s “To Be Young Gifted And Black”, not Soulja Boy’s “Kiss Me Thru The Phone”. Something is telling me that “Thotiana” and songs of the like just won’t have the same amount of historical heft as we bestow on songs of a previous era.
This goes far beyond the American canon. In my other home country, South Africa, it is hard for me to invoke modern artists like Riky Rick or the Distruction Boyz in the same breath as historic greats like Hugh Masekela or Miriam Makeba. “Omunye” (a Distruction Boyz song) and “Stimela (The Coal Train)” (a Hugh Masekela song), are respectively popular, but they seem to be worlds apart. There is a depth explored, an image captured, a feeling generated, a chunk of ground broken in the music that was popular before … that I am just not sure is present with the current.
However, all of what I just said does not mean a few things. It does not mean that there are no artists making meaningful music now — and not every single song of every artist I’m referring to is meaningless either. There are definitely artists and songs that are groundbreaking and inspirational. What’s significant is that they are no longer the popular, mainstream choice. And most importantly it does not mean the music is bad. I would be lying if I told you that I have never joined Beyoncé in telling that man to put his stuff “in the box to the left”. And we all gotta “Bop” just a little with DaBaby every now and again.
Popular art reflects the popular mood in society at any given time. Surely, then, it can only be because of our own shift in mood that we are seeing a shift in creative artistry.
Popular music nowadays is certainly more playful, with more of an emphasis on money, having fun, and “living life.” These are luxuries that hard-fought freedom has bought black people everywhere in this world. Luxuries that Nina Simone, Hugh Masekela, and others like them largely did not enjoy but put so much of their music and energy towards achieving for their peoples and those that followed.
This is the critical point that I think Professor West was missing. This wave of black music we are living through is one of the most beautiful expressions of black freedom that was fought for by the work of those that came before. And whether the music is good or bad is not as important as the simple fact that it can exist.
We should be in awe of the fact that rappers can spend hours talking about drugs, money, and sex because that means they have the freedom and means to even consider that. We should bask in the glory of the fact that singers can sing about their hair or jewelry because that means that they do not have to be singing just for their right to exist. We should take pride in the fact that not every song has that “historical heft” I spoke of because it means we have the luxury of living in a world where we can afford to have music that does not have to be historical.
The fact that we can have some popular music that is just for fun and not much else means that we can have a popular mood among black people sometimes that is also just for fun and not much else. That definitely has not always been the case. In some way, this is what progress looks like.
Whether they knew it or not, this is part of what the artists that came before were putting their energy towards. And now that we have it, we should not be hesitant about it or attack it. We should embrace it. Love it. Enjoy the feeling it gives us and use that as the impetus to continue to push for more freedom going forward.

Members of the Harvard Graduate Council elected Harvard Medical School student Chanthia C. Ma and Harvard Law School student Joshua J. Freundel as the body’s next president and vice president at a Zoom meeting Monday night.
HGC members — who represent students from all 12 of the University’s graduate schools — also tapped five other students to join the body’s executive board. Ma will replace outgoing president and School of Public Health student Bryan O. Buckley, and Freundel will replace Ma, who previously served as vice president of the Council.
Ma wrote in an email that she is “super excited” to work with the new HGC board. As the first elected female president of HGC since 2014, Ma wrote she hopes to pursue initiatives that will foster diversity and integrate Harvard graduate students across the different schools.
“I want to further build a community for graduate students at Harvard, where we will no longer feel like 12 distinct schools, strangers to each other, but “One Harvard” where being a student at one school gives us access to the breadth and depth of opportunities and experiences across all of Harvard,” Ma wrote.
Buckley said he believes Ma’s experiences as a Medical School student representing the Longwood campus and her work as vice-president of HGC will help her succeed in her new position.
“She brings such a good perspective to addressing Longwood issues, which I think a lot of times don't always get talked about,” Buckley said. “She’s a bright person, very organized, she’s kept me organized and definitely been my right hand person.”
HGC held this year's elections on the online conferencing platform Zoom, with members using the poll function to vote. Freundel said HGC plans to utilize social distancing technologies to hold meetings and events, as well as to address student concerns with visas and University housing exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
“COVID-19 has led to making certain issues of advocacy which were already there much more prominent,” Freundel said. “[The HGC members plan] to really be there as a resource and to make sure that it’s visible and that everybody knows that we can be there to foster that sense of welcoming even at a distance.”
Ji Soo “Janet” Park, Brett A. Monson, Han “Angela” Zhang ’11, Abhinaya Narayanan, and Heidi K. Brandow were also elected to the Council’s executive board, representing four different graduate schools. The new board members will officially assume their positions May 1.
Buckley said he was “truly impressed” by the new board members’ wide-ranging backgrounds.
“There’s so much diversity in this new group, both from a school background, cultural background, gender background,” Buckley said. “I’m really happy that HGC will continue to be very diverse, which I think is which is one of our core values.”

As schools around the country transition to virtual learning, LabXChange — a new scientific learning platform built by Harvard — allows STEM students the opportunity to mimic a science classroom and lab experience.
LabXChange, which launched in late January with funding from the Amgen Foundation, is built on top of edX’s open source infrastructure, allowing cross compatibility. Its “learning pathways” combine videos, texts, and graphics to customize the learning process for the individual student. The site also features virtual lab simulations, allowing students to mimic common procedures.
The site originally launched with the goal of diversifying access to quality scientific education. However, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic — which closed schools around the country and the world — meant a rapid shift in focus for the development team, according to Molecular and Cellular Biology professor and LabXChange faculty director Robert A. Lue.
“Our big focus right now is to try to, for as many people as we can, ease the transition to online, which, for many folks, they were simply not expecting,” Lue said.
As a result of the rapid demand for the online platform — which now has over 250,000 users — the LabXChange team concentrated on features critical to remote learning. New features launched in the last week give teachers the ability to add their own questions to a learning pathway, create discussion forums, access progress reports for their students, and integrate textbook chapters into learning pathways.
One of the textbooks featured is that of Life Sciences 1A: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences.” Beginning in the fall, all students in the class will access materials through the LabXChange platform.
Many new LabXChange users are K-12 educators — who often lack centralized online platforms such as Canvas or Blackboard, which are staples of college-level remote learning.
Debora O’Reilly, a biotechnology teacher at Essex North Shore Agricultural & Technical School, a high school in northern Massachusetts, said the lab simulations offered by LabXChange augment her online teaching and give students greater opportunities for learning.
“Say they were working on pipetting. They have to be able to move the pipette through the platform, reset the volume and put a tip on the pipette,” O’Reilly said. “It gives them as close to a real feeling of actually holding the pipette and using it as you could possibly do without really doing it.”
She said she thinks the platform will motivate other science teachers to consider a flipped-classroom format, where students prepare for a lab digitally before coming to class.
“You really want to be able to have the students as prepared as possible before they're doing the wet lab — the actual physical lab — because the agents are so expensive,” O’Reilly said. “This is really going to help with that problem.”
Mary S. Liu ’09, an AP biology and biotechnology teacher at Weston High School in Massachusetts, said that although she used the platform before the outbreak, it now plays a central role in her online classroom.
“Instead of me just lecturing and using slides, [students] are able to scroll through and see the process animated,” Liu said. “It's great to isolate particular components, and we can go back and review when we're talking face to face.”
As more teachers and students familiarize themselves with the platform, Lue says that he hopes the virtual platform can gain traction, especially for students who do not have access to a physical laboratory.
“For students that don't have a brick and mortar classroom to go to, my hope is that, especially with the lab simulations that we have, [the platform] will open up a completely new universe of how to have an experience of the scientific process,” Lue said.
Correction: April 9, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mary S. Liu ’09 teaches at Weston High School in Connecticut. In fact, she teaches at Weston High School in Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard’s campus operations largely halted due to the novel coronavirus last month, the Harvard Graduate School of Design’s fleet of 3-D printers has been put to work producing personal protective equipment for medical personnel at nearby hospitals.
Following weeks of conversation and planning, the printers began generating visors and face shields on Saturday and have continued operating since then, completing 90 face shields by the end of the weekend.
Stephen Ervin, the Design School’s Assistant Dean for Information Technology, has been overseeing production. Ervin runs the school’s fabrication lab, which houses the 3-D printers and other tools typically used for student projects.
After realizing that it would not be feasible to continue operating the lab for student use in the wake of Harvard’s closure, Ervin said he and a number of other Design School affiliates shifted their attention to looking for ways to help the medical community.
After consulting with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Mass General Brigham Center for COVID Innovation, the Design School formulated a design for visors and face shields, and sent it to the printers.
“A number of places around the world were stepping up saying, ‘We know there’s a shortage of PPE in all kinds of hospitals,’ and there was a fair amount of enthusiasm among GSD faculty, staff and students to figure out some kind of a way to get in on that and make use of our idle fabrication facilities,” ’Ervin said.
Christopher Hansen, the Design School’s digital fabrication technical specialist, has been working in the lab to produce these masks and shields, which he says is just a new way of utilizing the existing resources of the fabrication lab.
“One of the things that makes the GSD unique, and the reason why we have 127 3-D printers is that part of the classwork requires a lot of model making,” he said. “Given the GSD’s nature and the culture of making things it wasn’t very hard for us to say okay well we have this one model, we know it works, and now we can just produce it as much as possible.”
The school currently plans to produce around 3,500 visors and laser cut around 800 face shields over the course of this week, after which its supplies will run out. Hansen said he and others are searching for additional materials — by way of both purchases and donations — in hopes of continuing production.
“The bottleneck now is the clear material for the shield itself — that’s hard to get a hold of now,” Hansen said. “The other day, there was a guy in Lexington who had ordered a bunch of sheets off of Amazon and said, ‘Hey, I have all of these sheets, can you use them?’ So I went out and picked them up.”
“It’s very grassroots now,” he added. “There are a lot of individual people trying to contribute whatever resources they have.”

Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair outlined her office’s new residential plan in a Thursday interview, describing extra precautionary measures to ensure the safety of the several hundred students that remain on campus.
“As part of our de-densification plan, we also established a new residential plan,” O’Dair said. “Our primary guidance was the advice of public health experts.”
The Dean of Students Office’s current residential policies prohibit shared living spaces and bathrooms, gatherings of more than two people, and the use of common spaces in the Houses. In addition, the DSO imposed a strict ban on alcohol to limit the impact of intoxicated students on an “overburdened” healthcare system, according to the policy.
This modified residential plan follows University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s March 10 mandate that students vacate their on-campus housing in response to the spread of the coronavirus.
Several hundred undergraduates currently remain on campus, according to Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01. She said Thursday that the DSO made decisions on accommodations for remaining students in conjunction with faculty deans and house staff.
“There's just been a huge swell of working together in collaboration to ensure that students are being supported, and that they're being supported in safe ways,” Brandt said.
In an email, College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to specify the exact number of students residing on campus.
Linda Lee ’21, a Crimson blog and technology editor, said being on campus has felt “normal but isolating.”
“Being on campus has helped maintain the regular structure of typical college life because you’re surrounded by familiar buildings and in your room all the time,” Lee said. “The social aspects have been the hardest simply because no one can really see each other, so you’re left to yourself.”
Lee added that the Harvard University Dining Services staff has made her experience more pleasant by accommodating student suggestions. Per the DSO residential policy, HUDS is continuing to prepare bagged meals three times a day with multiple options at each meal time.
“HUDS has gone above and beyond to make sure we are comfortable,” Lee said. “If you ever have a request, they will change it for you."
“For example, the bags used to be prepacked, and you just kind of got your bag and left,” she added. “I asked one time if I could get one of the side salads from another bag, and they said they couldn’t. The next day they started a completely new system of being able to assemble your own bags.”
Eugenio Donati ’20, who is from northern Italy, said remaining in Adams House has limited his social interactions.
“It’s very, very empty,” Donati said. “I walked around campus for five to ten minutes and did not run into anyone.”
“You go downstairs, get your meal, and then you go back to eat lunch or dinner in your room,” he added. “My physical social life is now non-existent, so I try to talk to my friends on FaceTime or the phone as much as possible.”
Claira Janover ’20 — a Currier House resident who has moved to Kirkland House — said her only interactions with others in Kirkland have been while she was picking up meals in the dining hall. She said her days have not been very busy.
“I just kind of run around the river — no more than a couple of miles — and then have my Zoom class and just stay up and watch TV,” Janover said. “It's definitely not productive.”
Janover added that she has found support from the College to be imperfect yet helpful in stabilizing her residential situation following the order to vacate dorms.
“When we were first kicked off campus, I was pretty anxious and panicked because I relied on housing,” she said. “I know there's a lot of complaints about it, but I’m just putting it into perspective in comparison to other schools where there wasn't even an option to stay on campus. I know that it's not a perfect world, but I think they're trying their best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
N. Michael McKinnell, an influential architect who co-designed Boston City Hall and taught at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design for more than 20 years, passed away due to coronavirus complications late last month. He was 84.
McKinnell’s work with longtime professional partner Gerhard M. Kallmann included several prominent buildings across Boston and on Harvard’s campus. The duo designed Harvard Business School’s Shad Hall and won awards for their work on Harvard Law School’s Hauser Hall.
McKinnell met Kallmann as a graduate student at Columbia University, where he worked as his teaching assistant. The two entered the competition as extreme long-shots to design Boston City Hall in 1962. Their selection for the project over 255 other submissions would help catapult them — and the city — into prominence.
“They believed in using the concrete language of heaviness, weightiness, to represent that civic aspiration of the building,” said architect Mark E. Pasnik, who interviewed McKinnell for the 2015 book “Heroic: Concrete Architecture and the New Boston.”
GSD Professor Alex Krieger, who serves as the Interim Chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Design, said City Hall’s profound architecture played a role in Boston’s urban revival.
“This was one of the mechanisms by which it was trying to kind of re-establish itself as a viable city. Boston was like the Detroit of the 1930s and ’40s,” Krieger said. “This was kind of a symbol of the phoenix-like recovery of the City of Boston.”
The project helped both McKinnell and Kallmann land positions on the faculty of Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. McKinnell served as a professor from 1966 until 1988.
“Architecture students tend to be fascinated by the new and the different and the radical and the experimental in terms of design. And this met all of those criteria,” Krieger said. “Instantly, both of them developed a very strong impact on the GSD architecture curriculum.”
Krieger added that McKinnell was influential in helping students identify their architectural “voice.”
“He wanted to extract from you what you thought about the physical world and how you hoped to transform it through architecture,” he said. “He was not being an ideologue trying to convince you to do it a certain way.”
McKinnell and Kallmann’s work slowed in the 1970s due to an economic recession, as well as a shifting architectural design movement.
“As it moved into the mid-1970s, the ethos around architecture changed pretty dramatically — a shift from modernism to the post-modern period was occurring nationwide and actually worldwide,” Pasnik said.
In 1978, however, McKinnell’s architectural firm, Kalman McKinnell & Wood, was commissioned to design the American Academy of Arts and Sciences building in Cambridge. The building’s design is defined by a brick style that stands in stark contrast to the Brutalist structure of Boston City Hall. It marked a new direction for McKinnell’s work.
“Certainly there were consistent ideas that ran through their entire career, but the language was quite different,” Pasnik said of the building. “It sort of had more direct historical references — it was kind of a softer language, a little more accessible to the public.”
“The American Academy building was really kind of a rebirth of their practice,” he added.
McKinnell went on to design several more buildings around the world, often focusing on education and civic institutions ranging from Boston’s Back Bay Station to the United States embassy in Bangkok.
Pasnik, who graduated from the GSD in 1995, said McKinnell had a legacy of “wanting buildings to be about engaging the public.”
“Throughout his work, there was always a desire to be civic and public with architecture,” he said.
McKinnell first met his wife, Stephanie E. Mallis, while she was a student at the Graduate School of Design in the 1970s. Mallis and McKinnell reconnected years later and worked together on architectural projects before marrying in 2003.
“They were open thinkers,” Mallis said of McKinnell and Kallmann. “It had everything to do with the program and the client and the site and the materials. If you look at their buildings, they’re all quite different.”
McKinnell is survived by Mallis, two children from his first marriage, Phoebe McKinnell Ventola and Caitlin McKinnell Klatz; a sister, Sheila Sharman; as well as four grandchildren.
“Magical person,” Mallis said of her late husband. “He was just very insightful and sensitive.”

Harvard Graduate School of Design Dean Sarah M. Whiting will take a partial step back from her position after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, she announced in an email to the school’s affiliates.
Whiting, who is also professor of architecture at the Design School, has served as dean since July 2019.
“As difficult as it will be, especially at this critical juncture in the school’s history, I will need to follow the advice of my physician team (as well as of Harvard’s President and Provost) and do my best to turn my energy toward my recovery,” Whiting wrote in her Monday email.
In the email, she also announced that professors Rahul J. Mehrotra and Niall Kirkwood will assume some responsibilities for day-to-day operations at the school.
Mehrotra, she wrote, will represent her in working with the School of Design’s senior leadership at the University. Mehrotra was recently appointed chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Design as well as being appointed a Professor of Housing and Urbanization at the Design School, and is due to assume both positions in July.
Whiting wrote thay Kirkwood will continue his duties as the School of Design’s Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, including overseeing faculty searches, reviews, and policies. In addition to serving as associate dean, Kirkwood is also Professor of Landscape Architecture and Technology at the Design School, where he has been a member of the faculty since 1992.
Though Whiting noted the coronavirus pandemic has “deeply affected” the School of Design and its affiliates, she wrote she has “complete and total confidence” in the School of Design’s ability to navigate the current situation.
“Your collective willingness to jump into the fray, lend a hand, and help bring our school through the current moment—your generosity and your grit—have been endlessly inspiring to me personally,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard faculty and administrators are working to support students at risk of receiving unsatisfactory grades following the College’s March 28 switch to emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading for all spring classes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh asked faculty to communicate their expectations for satisfactory work to their students and asked students to reach out to their instructors if they have grading concerns.
The Office of Undergraduate Education has encouraged instructors to set flexible deadlines for students facing challenges during the pandemic.
“We’d encourage you to be as flexible as you can, consistent with the goals of the course, in adjusting deadlines for those students,” the OUE’s guidance to faculty reads.
Additionally, students who encounter coronavirus-related difficulties can petition for an extension to their coursework deadlines up to July 1, per decision by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy.
The emergency grading scheme will be the same as standard satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading, but will carry an emergency notation on transcripts, according to the College’s coronavirus website page. While a satisfactory grade does not count toward a student’s grade point average, the College’s handbook states that an unsatisfactory grade is a “failing grade” and counts as a mark of 0.0 toward the GPA.
Prior to the adoption of the emergency grading system, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke announced extensions to the deadlines for dropping courses and switching between letter grading and pass-fail options. Several academic departments then said they would accept pass-fail courses for concentration credit.
Students who elected to take courses pass-fail then, however, will now have to meet a higher bar to pass under the universal grading system. While a grade of D-minus or higher would earn a “pass,” “satisfactory” marks require grades of C-minus or higher.
Claybaugh said she emailed the roughly 300 faculty members teaching courses that some students chose to take pass-fail, asking them to inform those students whether they are on track to receive a satisfactory grade. She also asked those instructors to identify students who wanted to take their courses pass-fail and to help those students in particular achieve satisfactory marks.
Faculty members said they are aware of the challenges students are facing and plan to offer students flexibility in light of them.
“My sense is that faculty are very aware of the challenges increasing numbers of our undergraduate and graduate students are facing and are doing our best to make sure that students are given opportunities to pass all their courses this semester,” Comparative Literature professor Karen L. Thornber said. “We want to do our best to support our students as conditions become more dire across the nation and around the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cough, fever, tiredness, difficulty breathing — most Harvard College students have spent the past month reading symptoms of the coronavirus in University emails, news articles, and Facebook groups.
But beyond the physical health crisis, some students say the pandemic has had quiet but pernicious effects on their mental health. Separated from their on-campus support systems, students said protracted social isolation, sick family members, lost jobs, and abusive households have overwhelmed them with anxieties beyond fears of the virus.
After spending a week of her freshman year in a psychiatric hospital for suicide ideation, Nicole M.“Nikki” Daurio ’20 founded the Green Ribbon Club, a student-run non-profit aimed at destigmatizing mental health.
Daurio said discussions about the physical threat of the coronavirus often elide the mental stressors it has presented.
“Our lives are all put on hold right now — that doesn't mean our mental illnesses are put on hold too,” Daurio said. “We're all saying health is the number one priority — that's why we got kicked off campus, that's why we're social distancing.”
“But we need to also emphasize that mental health is also our number one priority,” she added.
Marcus M. Trenfield ’21, who sits on the board of the College’s Student Mental Health Liaisons, said the pandemic has stirred a toxic mix of mental health concerns for many students.
Like Daurio, he said he worries the College gave insufficient thought to mental health in a bid to protect students’ physical well-being.
“I think the idea was just like, ‘Let’s get students off this campus immediately so that students won't get [the coronavirus],’” he said. “But I think a lot of people are experiencing stress being at home.”
Some students transitioned to environments where they could not study, and others began to worry about money as they lost steady jobs on campus, Trenfield said. He added that he is personally facing significant stress from having lost his on-campus job working for Dorm Crew.
And for some, going home meant confronting the very real threat of the virus.
Aarushi H. Shah ’21 said she faced similar problems to many of her peers in recent weeks: leaving hastily, studying from afar.
“But what I wasn't prepared for was that my dad was diagnosed with COVID-19 over spring break,” Shah said.
Shah now lives at her aunt’s house in the Chicago area, along with her sister, who is five months pregnant. With her father in the hospital and her mother at home 40 minutes away, she said she and her sister have called their parents multiple times a day.
“I guess I never imagined that I would be in a situation where I'd be video calling my parents in the same city as them but not being able to see either of them,” she said.
For the past few weeks, Shah said she has felt extreme anxiety about her father’s health, which has taken a toll on her own mental health and ability to “function as a human being.”
“It has just been immensely stressful to try to balance school and every other aspect of life while knowing that one's own father is in the hospital struggling to breathe, struggling to live,” she said.
“It's been crippling where I'm by my phone 24/7 wondering if I'm going to get a call saying that something happened to my dad, trying to stay awake at night, but then also knowing in the back of my mind that I have to go to a Zoom class or I have my paper due,” she added.
Shah said she misses the support systems available on campus. She said the series of unspooling high-level decisions prompted by the crisis — the campus evacuation, the transition to online classes, nationwide lockdowns — made her feel like she had little control over her life.
“I couldn't control that I was moving, couldn't control that classes were moving online, and couldn't control my dad's health,” she said. “And the fear of the unknown, of what could happen, it's paralyzing sometimes.”
For students already living with existing mental health conditions, continuing school away from campus has forced them to find new ways to cope.
Jennifer X. “Jenny” Hong ’23, who works as a peer counselor at Harvard Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, said the transition home can be especially difficult for students with eating disorders.
Some students’ eating habits and schedules at home may differ from those at school; others may lack the healthy or fresh foods served in campus dining halls.
Hong said many students may face additional scrutiny from their family members about their weight and eating habits.
“We're forced to now live with parents or other relatives who understandably are very concerned for a lot of students’ health,” she said. “A lot of family members will be talking about things like weight and body image.”
One student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he lives in an abusive home environment, said lack of access to exercise facilities has aggravated his own binge eating disorder.
The anonymous student said he has also previously been treated for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder — conditions which living in tight quarters with his family has exacerbated.
“Usually, if I'm at therapy, it's something to do with that fact that I'm gay. I'm not out to my parents,” he said. “My parents are also emotionally abusive, and there's a lot of trauma there that I usually go to a therapist at Harvard for.”
While he was able to access mental health resources at Harvard, the student said his parents prohibit him from seeing a therapist at home and are unaware he had previously visited Counseling and Mental Health Services on campus. He said he is unable to independently seek mental health services at home because he is on his parents’ health insurance plan.
Though the student said others in comparable situations successfully petitioned to stay on campus for the remainder of the semester, his parents insisted that he return home.
“It has also led to a lot more memories of related trauma just because I'm in my childhood home,” the student said. “The week that was supposed to be spring break, aside from sort of unpacking and setting up a workspace, I genuinely think I spent most of that time dissociating.”
The College has recently publicized its reconfigured remote mental health resources offered through CAMHS. On April 2, HUHS emailed Harvard affiliates with information about its new online offerings, such as teletherapy, video-based group therapy, and online resilience workshops.
However, Daurio said she personally does not benefit from therapy delivered through phone calls.
“I need to see therapists in person,” she said. “Even if we say, ‘Okay, great, we have all these mental health resources,’ it's not going to help everyone.”
The anonymous student also said he cannot seek help via teletherapy because he cannot always find the space to speak privately.
“The phone is already a much less effective medium, I think, than face-to-face therapy or counseling,” he said. “But then additionally, it’s phone therapy or counseling under the cover of night, far away, in paranoia.”
Other students cannot access care they sought in the Boston area, a short trip away from campus.
Trenfield said that he specifically worries for this group. He added that some students with bipolar disorder, for example, receive specialized care at Massachusetts General Hospital.
“But now with everyone going back home, they don't really have access to those resources anymore,” Trenfield said. “I'm most concerned for students like that who weren’t in the system because they were looking for more specialized help, and then lost all that support.”
In a bid to provide mental health support from afar, some Harvard students have made resource lists and launched social media campaigns in recent weeks.
Laura A. Jenny ’21 leads the undergraduate contingent of the new student task force “Students vs Pandemics.” She said the group is currently working to identify how the pandemic has impacted people’s mental health, as well as publicize solutions and resources.
The group hopes to circulate mental health and wellness resources released by the Center for Disease Control and World Health Organization via social media campaigns, Jenny said.
“A lot of students wouldn't normally seek out those sources because we all have other things on our mind,” Jenny said. “But if we can bring those types of resources to the forefront of what people are thinking about by just posting on social media and talking about it, I think it's a great way to make sure that everybody resets, refreshes and keeps their mental health and wellness in check.”
The group also plans to solicit and publish anonymous writing submissions from students about their experiences during the pandemic.
“I think another big thing is providing people with an outlet to talk about what they're going through,” Jenny said. “What I'm really interested in is making sure social distancing doesn't become social isolation.”
The task force's other initiatives include hosting virtual meditation and yoga sessions and collaborating with peer counseling services to publicize mental health resources to students on- and off-campus.
Hong, who is also involved in “Students vs Pandemics,” said ECHO will also launch various social media campaigns to disseminate motivational messages and information about mental health resources during the coming months.
“We’re just getting the word out there that it's okay if you aren't super productive during this quarantine, it's okay if you gain weight, and your worth shouldn't be determined by either of those things,” Hong said. “Take care of yourself and spend some time for personal care and reflection during this time.”
Jenna D. Lang ’21, who is collaborating with a professor to develop public recommendations for mental well-being during the crisis, also said she believes personal care resources are essential.
“Limiting your news consumption like to keep you from feeling these negative feelings for prolonged periods of time is definitely helpful. Or balancing the time you're spending with news and social media with other activities, such as reading or talking to people on the phone,” she said.
Aside from student-run initiatives, some said they believe house and department networks can support individual students.
Joel P. Balkaran ’20 said he thinks the residential system provides a valuable framework for administrators to connect with and support undergraduates.
“I'm in Cabot, and it definitely has been helpful for the tutors to be checking in with us or just seeing how we're doing,” he said. “It's been good to see the ground-level support.”
Lang said academic departments have a similar capacity to attend to individual students. She pointed to emails that the Psychology department sent to concentrators featuring affirmations, coping tips, positive videos, and webinars about how to find social connection and joy.
Beyond resources, Daurio said students struggling with mental health need consistent empathetic and supportive messaging from the College.
“Give them the resources, but then also just remind them, ‘We're here for you. And you're always in our thoughts,’” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is working with higher education lobbying groups to alleviate unforeseen challenges presented by the global coronavirus pandemic, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
Newton wrote in an email that University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard have been working with other institutions, associations, and student groups to ensure policy makers know of the impacts on institutions and students during the COVID-19 global pandemic.
“In many communities, colleges and universities are leading employers as well as home to thousands of students and faculty,” Newton wrote. “Many of us are also on the frontlines of the research and health care response to the coronavirus with intense efforts in our labs as well as engagement with hospital and other community partners.”
“Like elsewhere in the economy, COVID-19 has disrupted higher education and had significant impact, financial and otherwise," he added.
In a Monday interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run news publication — Bacow said he has been on calls with the American Council on Education and the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts.
ACE Senior Vice President of Government Relations and Public Affairs Terry W. Hartle said the pandemic has impacted every aspect of higher education.
“It is easy for people who don't spend a lot of time in higher education to underestimate the impact of the increased costs the schools are seeing and the reduced revenue,” he said.
Hartle said even prominent state schools are facing unprecedented financial burdens. For instance, one Division 1 university in the Big Ten Conference estimates it has incurred $71 million dollars in costs and lost revenue through April 1, according to Hartle.
“Colleges and universities are refunding by our estimate about $8 billion dollars in room and board charges alone,” he said. “Any college, university budgeted that money as if they would be getting it for the full year. Nobody anticipated that for 20 or 25 percent of the year, they would simply have to give that money back.”
Harvard’s $40 billion dollar endowment is in a grave situation as the country faces the pandemic and a possible recession, according to experts.
Though the pandemic affects every institution of higher education, Hartle said that for some institutions, the unexpected costs pose “an existential threat.”
“The implications for some parts of the higher education community are dire,” he said.
Because the needs of different institutions in the higher education industry are “diverse,” Hartle said they “build a consensus set of recommendations for policy makers that we can all stand behind.”
Last month, Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package to fund legislation that included, among other provisions, providing small-business loans, unemployment benefits, and individual checks to households to relieve the economic effects of the pandemic. It is unclear what lawmakers will prioritize in a possible fourth stimulus bill.
In the third supplemental spending bill, Hartle said ACE lobbied for money to provide discretionary money to colleges and universities, as well AS discrete, emergency grants to students seeking financial aid to help them meet food, shelter, housing, travel, and other needs. The stimulus package set aside $14 billion for higher education to offset costs and fund student grants.
“The fact of the matter is that Congress noted the needs facing institutions and students in the third stimulus,” he said. “We're hoping that in the fourth stimulus we can encourage them to do even more.”
Newton also wrote that Harvard has been collaborating during the pandemic with federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Homeland Security, to ensure researchers receive adequate support.
“Beyond legislation, we have also worked with leading federal agencies on flexibilities to assist students in emergency costs, ensure research grants can continue to support our skilled workforce even as labs have been mostly shuttered, and to work toward visa systems that remain operational, particularly in critical fields,” he wrote.

By this time, we’ve all pretty much settled into a routine and (sort of) know how to use Zoom without crashing the app. But if you start feeling adventurous, there are a multitude of hidden features that Flyby has discovered for you to try out.
Touch Up My Appearance
This feature is perfect for when you’re too lazy to put makeup on or you haven’t showered or shaved in the past three days. On Zoom, go to Preferences → Video → Touch Up My Appearance for an instant de-wrinkler that will smooth away any stubble and/or eyebags in a second. And hey, even if you think your 1x1 screen is probably too small for anyone else to see, you’ll thank us for that facelift in this time of stress.
Upcoming Meeting Reminder
Never sleep through a lecture again with Zoom’s Upcoming Meeting Reminder. Click on the little arrow next to the video icon, press Video Settings, and then click General. Click on “Remind me before my next meeting.” Now you can get a notification while you’re deep in your eighth hour of Netflix so you don’t miss your seminar again!
Zoom a Movie
If Netflix Party isn’t working out for you, try recreating wine and movie nights with your blockmates over Zoom! Simply share your screen and click “Share computer sound” in the bottom left hand corner. It’s a little bit laggy but will survive long enough to get you through a screening of “Contagion.”
Change Reaction Emoji
Use emojis that are realistic to your skin tone! You probably want to send an applause or thumbs up when you don’t feel like participating, so you might as well. Click on the little arrow next to the video icon, press Video Settings, then General, and, finally, select your emoji of choice.
Far End Video Control
We’re not yet sure what this one does, but according to Zoom, you can “allow another user to take control of your camera during a meeting,” which sounds simultaneously exciting and horrifying. Although Harvard has disabled this function, maybe try it out with your blockmates on the free version of Zoom and let us know what happens!
Whenever you’re inevitably bored in lecture, take a chance and try out one of these Zoom hacks! We can guarantee you’ll at least stay awake five minutes longer.
