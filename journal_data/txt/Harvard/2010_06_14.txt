After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama has appointed School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray to a national commission tasked with providing recommendations to prevent future spills that result from offshore drilling.
The creation of the commission comes on the heels of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico—considered the largest offshore spill in U.S. history—that resulted from a Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion in April.
Murray, who was named one of the "50 Most Important Women in Science" by Discover Magazine in 2002, has served on numerous national and international scientific advisory committees and possesses extensive administrative and academic experience.
The other members of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling include Frances G. Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council; Donald Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Terry D. Garcia, excutive vice president for mission programs for the National Geographic Society; and Frances Ulmer, chancellor of the University of Alaska  Anchorage.
"These individuals bring tremendous expertise and experience to the critical work of this commission," Obama is quoted in a Washington press release. "I am grateful they have agreed to serve as we work to determine the causes of this catastrophe and implement the safety and environmental protections we need to prevent a similar disaster from happening again."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric Balderas '13 sits down with The Crimson for an exclusive  interview to detail what went through his mind last Monday when he was  detained after attempting to board a plane from San Antonio,  Texas to Boston.
Balderas, an undocumented student, had presented his Harvard  identification and a consular card from the Mexican government upon  misplacing his Mexican passport and now faces the possibility of deportation to  Mexico.
 Nervous and stressed, Balderas said he thought constantly about  the safety of his family throughout Monday's events and even considered writing a letter to his mother.
"I had been so strong before," Balderas recalled. "And now my  spirits  were just destroyed."
Balderas was released on Monday, pending an immigration hearing July 6. The rising sophomore, who eventually took a flight to Boston on Wednesday, chose not  to return home and did not tell his mother about the incident.
"I don't want her to worry about it," Balderas said.
Since  Monday, Balderas has slowly become more vocal about his status as an  undocumented student and has raised awareness for the Development,  Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which would provide  undocumented youth with a six-year-long path to citizenship under  certain conditions.
Some opponents of immigration reform argue that to grant Balderas pardon would be to condone an illegal act, regardless of his academic standing. Yet others have come to the student's defense, emphasizing his strong identification as an American and his outstanding academic history.
Mark M.  Medvesky, public affairs officer at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said on Saturday  that he cannot disclose details about Balderas' particular case due to  the Department of Homeland Security's privacy policy.
"When ICE encounters an individual suspected  of being in the country illegally, we exercise our discretion on a  case-by-case basis," Medvesky said.  "In some instances, we issue a Notice to Appear before an  immigration judge."
As he awaits the final verdict on July 6, Balderas  assures others who find themselves in a similar situation that the battle is not over.
"Just hang in there," Balderas said. "Let others know of your problem  and try and gain support for the DREAM Act, because that's ultimately  what's going to save us all."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not everyday that an athlete gets the chance to compete for a national title. Junior distance runner Claire Richardson took advantage of one such rare opportunity on Friday night, capping off a stellar season on the track with a 19th-place finish and personal record in the 5,000-meter run at the NCAA national championships in Eugene, Ore.
“It was really exciting to be at Hayward Field, ‘Track Town USA’ as they call it,” Richardson said. “All of the athletes were really excited about competing, and all of the fans were excited about watching. It was cool to see some of the top athletes in the country compete and be among them.”
The 5k was the last event on day three of the four-day national championship meet, so it wasn’t until just before seven that Richardson stepped up to the starting line for the last race of her junior year.
“It was just a really exciting atmosphere,” Richardson said. “The race itself went fine, but it definitely was a positive experience that I will take away from the season and take with me, going into cross country and then indoor and outdoor track. “
As a result of a random draw to determine positioning, she began the race 12 runners out in the tightly packed main section of the double waterfall start. Richardson took advantage of the relatively slow initial pace to obtain positioning near the core of the main pack and ran a strong race throughout, though she lost a little ground as it drew to a close.
“My race strategy was to try to compete with everyone, to not be intimidated by the fact that it was nationals and just try to get after it,” Richardson said.
“I think I did that pretty well in the first half of the race,” she continued. “I maybe didn’t have the best positioning in the second half, but…I can learn from that about where I should be in future...There were a lot of elbows going back and forth [near the end].”
Senior Lisa Koll of Iowa State, who posted the fastest 10k time in Wednesday’s national championship race, led the group from the start, along with Illinois senior Angela Bizzarri and West Virginia junior Marie Louise Asselin.  After the first few laps, Koll and Bizzarri began to pull ahead and stretch the gap separating them from the rest of the runners. Suddenly, Bizzarri slowed her pace and stepped off the track, withdrawing from the race, as Koll went on to win the national title with a time of 15:23.80, a full 30 seconds faster than the second place runner.
After the first three finishers—Koll, Asselin, and Oregon junior Alex Kosinski— crossed the line, a blanket finish determined the next seven places in which the difference between fourth place and 10h place was just over one second. The remaining runners, including Richardson, followed closely behind.
The only Harvard competitor present at the championships, Richardson was one of two Ivy League runners in the 24-person 5k field. Her Princeton counterpart, sophomore Alex Banfich, finished the race in eighth place with a time of 16:06.79.
“Obviously, it would have been awesome to have Harvard people,” Richardson said. “I know in the future there will be more Harvard people than there have been in the past.”
“Luckily I had two of my coaches, Jason, Amy, and our trainer Gary with me, and they were ridiculously supportive,” she continued. “We bummed around Eugene for a couple of days so that was really fun. I really enjoyed spending time with them.”
Richardson’s time of 16:25.80 is the 2nd best time recorded in Harvard track and field history and is less than one second off the school record—16:25.24—held by Lois Brommer ’85-6. With this performance, Richardson improved on her then-personal-best national semifinal time, moving her up from No. 3 to No. 2 all-time in the 5,000-meter run.
A two-time Academic All-America selection and a three-season first team All-Ivy selection last year, Richardson dominated the distance events this season, starting in the fall with cross country, and continuing through winter and spring track.
The three season varsity athlete will begin her last year of running at Harvard next fall looking to “mix it up in the Ivy League” as a team on the hunt for a title and to build upon this year’s success on the track.
“Hopefully, knock on wood, I’ll make it back to nationals [next year],” Richardson said. “It was so awesome and eye-opening, being able to compete at that level, and it made me want to get back there again, compete, and really get after it again.”
