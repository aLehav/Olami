After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many of the candidates likely on the shortlist for the Harvard presidency, the University’s top job would bring not only power and prestige, but also a significant pay raise.
Harvard has been searching for its 29th president since University President Drew G. Faust announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018. The Crimson reported in Dec. 2017 that the search committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—had narrowed its candidate pool to under 20 names.
Faust’s successor could expect to make over $1.4 million annually. According to the most recent public tax filings, Faust earned $852,920 in base salary, $333,825 in deferred compensation—money the Harvard Corporation sets aside for her to access at a later date—and $160,403 in non-taxable benefits in fiscal year 2016. She also made $551,928 in "other reportable compensation," the filings indicate.
In total, her salary and benefits rank third among presidential compensations at other Ivy League institutions and Stanford, according to a Chronicle of Higher Ed analysis.
The search committee has repeatedly declined to comment on the progress of the search or to reveal the names of candidates under consideration. Nonetheless, prominent alumni, donors, professors, and administrators have pointed to several individuals—both internal and external to the University—that are likely on the committee’s under-20 list.
Internal candidates named by prominent donors and professors include Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77, and Government professor Danielle S. Allen.
All of these individuals would receive pay bumps if they were named the 29th President of Harvard. In fiscal year 2016, Nohria earned $724,907 and Garber earned $833,255 in total compensation,  according to 990 tax filings, which list the highest-compensated individuals employed by the University. Were he to become president, Smith’s salary would almost double—the filings show Smith earned $677,350 in the same year. Allen's salary was not large enough to merit a mention in the tax filings.
Possible external candidates would also see a spike in salary if they got the nod for Harvard’s top job. In a Dec. 2017 interview, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 named several candidates from outside the University he expects to see on the search committee’s shortlist, including Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander, World Bank President and former Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim, and University of Michigan President Mark S. Schlissel.
Lander—who Daley said was “almost certainly on the shortlist”—would earn the smallest pay bump; he earned $1,084,862 in fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent tax filings. Kim, like Smith, would see his annual income nearly double. He earned $492,690 in base salary and $208,407 in additional benefits as World Bank president. Schlissel earned $782,481 in the same timespan.
Judith A. Wilde, a professor at George Mason University who researches university presidents’ salaries, said she thinks candidates under consideration for the presidency will have little trouble negotiating a high income with Harvard’s top brass.
“More often than in the past, many trustees and board members of universities are CEOs or other high level figures at major corporations,” Wilde said. “So when a president is negotiating a contract and wants a bigger salary with lots of perks, these board members don’t necessarily see a problem with that.”
Wilde said that, today, many of the contracts for university and college presidents resemble the contracts for CEOs of top business firms in price range. She noted there are even attorneys who specialize in negotiating contracts for top education administrators.
Though the Harvard presidency represents a pay raise for many of the candidates likely on the committee’s shortlist, the University’s levels of executive compensation resemble or fall below those at peer schools. When compared to the heads of other Ivy League schools especially, Faust is sometimes out-earned.
In fiscal year 2016, Columbia president Lee C. Bollinger earned $2.5 million, while University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann earned $3 million—roughly twice Faust’s annual income.
Other presidents at Harvard’s peer institutions earned a salary similar to Faust’s in fiscal year 2016. The presidents of Brown, Princeton, and Dartmouth all earned around $1 million that year. Yale President Peter Salovey and Stanford President John L. Hennessy both earned slightly less than Faust: Salovey made $1,157,488 while Hennessy took in $1,202,934.
Raymond D. Cotton, a Washington attorney specializing in higher education leadership, said the pay discrepancy with some schools is likely intentional. He said Harvard's governing boards may want to convey that Harvard is “not the place to come to make money.”
“That’s not what we’re about. We are about educating people, conducting valuable research that is valuable to humanity,” Cotton said. “We are about providing service to the world community at large.”
Editor's Note: For ease of comparison, the chart on presidential salaries accompanying this article follows the Chronicle of Higher Education methodology for calculating total compensation, which sums base salary, benefits, and other compensation. This method puts Faust's income at $1.5 million. Typically, The Crimson excludes other compensation and includes deferred compensation, which places Faust's income at closer to $1.4 million.

UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 1:00 a.m. 
Executives Geetanjali Gupta ’00 and Richard L. Hall ’90 will both leave Harvard Management Company in February. Their departures come on the heels of a year of significant restructuring at HMC.
Gupta was the senior vice president of absolute return and public market funds at HMC, where she worked for over 10 years after working in the investment banking division of the Goldman Sachs Group. She is leaving to become chief investment officer of the New York Public Library, the library announced Jan. 9.
Gupta will begin her role at the library, which has 92 locations and serves more than 18 million patrons annually, on February 26. She will manage the library’s $1.2 billion endowment.
Gupta said in a January press release that she is excited about her new role.
“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to join the leadership team at The New York Public Library. I hope to achieve excellent returns, build an outstanding investment team and be an active leader in advancing the NYPL’s fundamental mission of strengthening diverse communities and inspiring a new generation of learners and researchers,” she said.
Library president Tony Marx said in the press release he is "thrilled" to welcome Gupta to the job. He called Gupta a "proven and trusted investor" and said he looks forward to seeing how her expertise will strengthen the library financially in years to come.
HMC private equity director Richard L. Hall will also depart the company. Hall joined HMC in 2014 as the third manager of the asset class in under a year. His last day at HMC will be Friday, Feb. 2, before he begins working as deputy chief investment officer for the University of Texas Investment Management Company.
In a letter to employees, HMC CEO N. P.  “Narv” Narvekar described Hall as “a talented investor” and “a responsible steward of the University’s resources.” The memo did not detail plans to replace Hall.
Narvekar, who joined HMC as CEO in late 2016, recently led efforts to revise the University’s management strategy. HMC announced early last year that it would lay off approximately half of its 230-person staff by the end of the calendar year as part of the beginning of a five-year-long overhaul. Harvard’s endowment is the world’s largest university endowment at $37.1 billion, but faced what Narvekar called “disappointing” returns last fiscal year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman defensive back Ben M. Abercrombie ’21 returned to his family’s house in Hoover, Ala., on Monday, his first time home since suffering a major neck injury in a football game four months ago that left him paralyzed and unable to breathe on his own.
Abercrombie sustained the injury in a game against Rhode Island in Sept. 2017; he underwent emergency surgery at Rhode Island Hospital immediately afterwards. A couple weeks later, Abercrombie transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Ga., where he has spent the past three months working on rehabilitation and physical therapy.
On Monday, friends and family gathered with balloons to welcome Abercrombie home. Local press and Hoover Police also turned out to greet the defensive back; at least one police car escorted him to the house. Abercrombie, seated in a wheelchair, smiled as he was lowered onto the driveway, according to video recorded by Boston25 News.
Speaking to reporters in front of his house Monday, Abercrombie said he was excited to be back in Hoover.
“I can't wait to get inside,” Abercrombie told Boston25 News.
But Abercrombie has already set his sights on a bigger goal: Returning to campus next fall to continue studying economics.
“I’m just trying to recover and when I get back I’ll be able to move my life forward and move on from the injury and everything,” Abercrombie said in an interview Saturday.
Though Abercrombie still has months of recovery in front of him, family members say they are hopeful given the improvement he has made in recent weeks. On Jan. 5, Abercrombie’s father Marty wrote about Ben’s progress in a post on the public blog he started to keep his son’s supporters updated.
“Over the course of the last few weeks, Ben has indicated he can feel some changes happening in his body. He can feel sensations particularly in his upper chest and upper back that he was not able to feel before,” Abercrombie wrote in the blog post. “Another positive development is that Ben has begun to initiate more breaths.”
Though Abercrombie will certainly face challenges in returning to campus, he said Saturday that he feels overall optimistic.
“Learning how to do math without hands is probably going to be the hardest part. And I guess moving around is going to be a little difficult, especially in the snow,” Abercrombie said. “But other than that, nothing, I think I’ll be alright.”
Both Harvard students and administrators have worked to help the Abercrombie family navigate the challenges posed by Ben’s injuries over the past four months.
The Harvard Varsity Club in early October started The Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, a fund meant to help the Abercrombie family afford expensive medical procedures. The fund will also assist any athlete who suffers “catastrophic injuries” while playing for Harvard going forward. As of Dec. 2017, the trust had garnered over $266,000.
Bob Glatz ’88, the executive director of the Varsity Club, wrote in an emailed statement Jan. 10 that the entire club was happy to hear Abercrombie had returned home. Glatz promised club members will continue to support the freshman and his family throughout his recovery.
“I was thrilled to hear that Ben returned home to Hoover, AL. The outpouring of support from the entire Harvard community these past 3-4 months has been inspiring,” Glatz wrote. "We realize there’s still a long way to go before Ben will be able to accomplish his goal of returning to classes at Harvard, but the Varsity Club will be there for him throughout the entire journey.”
A number of organizations have held fundraisers for the family since Abercrombie’s injury, including El Jefe’s Taqueria and Wing Zone, a chain of which Abercrombie’s father Marty is a franchise owner.
Abercrombie said in the interview Saturday that he feels grateful to everyone who has supported him over recent weeks. In particular, he thanked El Jefe’s, which donated all the proceeds from its Dec. 12 event—totaling roughly $27,000—to the Abercrombie fund.
“I’m grateful for all the support that the Harvard community has given me,” Abercrombie said. “I can’t wait to eat at El Jefe’s again. After what they’ve done for me too, it just makes the food even better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard officially filed a master plan for a segment of its Allston properties with Boston’s urban planning agency in early December—but the document will likely remain under review for weeks to come.
In January, the Boston Planning and Development Agency—the city’s planning body—extended the public comment period for the plan, ensuring Harvard must continue to gather feedback from local residents until early February. And, in response to a request from an advisory group of Allstonians helping oversee the University’s plans for the area, Harvard will hold extra meetings with area residents to discuss the filings, according to University spokesperson Kevin Casey.
The group of Allston residents—known as the Impact Advisory Group—is responsible for identifying possible social and environmental impact Harvard’s projects may have on the area, as well as determining steps to mitigate those effects. Based on the recommendations of this group, the city’s planning agency may ask Harvard to modify its plans.
“Harvard is pleased that the Boston Planning and Development Agency has extended the comment period until early next month, giving IAG and community members more time to review and respond to the plan, and for Harvard to answer any questions the members may have,” Casey wrote in an emailed statement.
The University filed the proposals with the agency on Dec. 7, specifically for a 14-acre portion of its Allston holdings known as the “Enterprise Research Campus,” a planned 36-acre center for entrepreneurship. According to the filings, the 14-acre segment will include 400,000 square feet of offices and labs, 250,000 square feet of hotel and conference center space, 250,000 square feet of residential space, nearly 900 parking spaces, and around 600 new bicycle parking spaces.
Harvard first proposed developing the enterprise research campus in 2011, when the Harvard Allston Work Team recommended the idea. In 2016, the University hired real estate agent Steven D. Fessler to serve as “head of enterprise real estate” and to guide construction of the area.
University officials presented specific plans for the 14-acre segment of the campus to Allston residents at a meeting in Nov. 2017. At the time, the University also described plans to construct two new roadways, Cattle Drive and East Drive, as well as various measures intended to better combat potential effects of climate change going forward.
At an Allston Impact Advisory Group meeting last week, Allston residents raised a variety of concerns about transportation, bike paths, housing, height of buildings, and green spaces. The University will likely discuss these and other issues at future Impact Advisory Group meetings.
After the review process ends, Harvard must find a development partner and write a building proposal. Following these steps, Harvard must submit an Article 80 filing to request approval for a Planned Development Area Development Plan, a more specific plan which will cover the zoning for this project.
