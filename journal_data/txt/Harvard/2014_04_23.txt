“At the beginning, I was just filming by myself,” said Thet Sambath, the Cambodian co-director of the documentary “Enemies of the People.” On April 17 at the Carpenter Center, the Mahindra Humanities Center hosted a film screening of “Enemies of the People,” followed by a panel discussion with the filmmaker. The 2009 film follows Sambath’s 10-year search for confessions and explanations for the 1975-1979 Cambodian genocide that led to the massacre of nearly two million people during the reign of the Khmer Rouge. Not only was Sambath motivated by a desire to reveal to the world the atrocities committed by the Cambodian government, but he was also fueled by the need for personal closure for the killings of his father, mother, and brother in the conflict. In making the film, Sambath gained the trust of former Khmer Rouge officials at all levels, working his way up to Nuon Chea, the right-hand man of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.
  Sambath’s search for answers started with two uneducated farmers who took part in the killings. “Most journalists have difficulty talking to them because they are foreigners and do not speak their language,” he said. “But for me, it is easy, because I am a countryman.” In the film, Khoun and Seang express regret and sorrow for their forced participation in the murder of innocent people. “I don’t know how many layers of hell I must go through before I can be reborn back into a human being,” Seang says. 
In addition to capturing the raw emotions of guilt and torment, Sambath’s film also illustrates the lack of communication between local and national government. This disconnect led to confusion surrounding where the fatal orders initially came from. Khoun and Seang took their orders from a higher official, who obtained orders from senior officials at the government level. “Nothing I did was of my own orders,” Khoun and Seang’s boss says in the film. “I was told to investigate Vietnamese spies hiding within the community and implement the solution.” The confusion in who gave the initial order for the killings has led to denial by the government and no one to blame.
  Sambath’s film has particular significance in the history of the Killing Fields because it is one of the only pieces of hard evidence that shows a high government official admit to the killings. “If we had shown mercy to these people [Vietnamese spies], the nation would have been lost,” Nuon Chea says, recorded on tape while sitting at the dinner table of his own home. “The country was in danger of being taken over by Vietnam, so Pol Pot ordered the killings out of fear that Vietnamese would infiltrate the Communist Party and government.” From these interviews with Nuon Chea, Sambath realizes that this overreaction stemmed from the Khmer Rouge’s inability to govern in a logical way.
At the discussion, Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, praised the film for its avoiding a clear-cut interpretation of events. “The importance of the documentary lies in its ability to very honestly and directly explore the consciousness of agents of destruction with a much finer understanding of ‘evil’ and ‘good,’” he said. “There is no clear line between ‘evil’ and ‘good’ here, only the destruction that was caused by a lack of inaction and fear.”
 Though praised by the international community, Sambath’s film has been perceived as a threat by the Cambodian government and caused Sambath to fear for his life. “[Sambath’s] work is perceived as a threat for a number of reasons. For one, it is the nature of research that he is unfolding and making available to the public,” Gregory H. Stanton, research professor in Genocide Studies and Prevention at George Mason University, said during the panel discussion. “A Cambodian who refused to succumb to the culture of fear that is still a part of Cambodian society, he is telling a genuine history.” Though Sambath expresses a desire to stay in Cambodia and spend time with his family working the farmland, he has been forced to seek shelter in the United States. “The situation forces me to be here,” he said at the discussion. “Many former Khmer Rouge members who were in Pol Pot’s inner circle now run the current government. Secret agents for the government have tried to kill me multiple times but have failed because people like taxi drivers and farmers have helped to save me. I went hiding into the forest because the government is against me after I fought out the truth.”

“Talking To Ourselves” takes a remarkably long time to read for a 150-page novel. At first glance, Andrés Neuman’s follow-up to his acclaimed epic “Traveler of the Century” has an easily navigable structure: it follows the brief and concurrent monologues of a mother (Elena), father (Mario), and son (Lito) as they experience Mario’s illness at the hands of an aggressive cancer. Yet Neuman, who crafts a different form of interior communication for each character—writing for Elena, voice recording for Mario, and thought for Lito—captures the cadences and mental progressions of his characters so accurately that it is necessary to read the book at the same pace one would hear speech. Each character is astonishingly consistent and life-like. Elena’s writings, buoyed by her knowledge of literature, are erratic and gorgeous ruminations on the confusing facets of illness. Her husband’s tape recordings to his son are heartbreaking and unsettlingly honest. And 10 year-old Lito’s thoughts are full of an innocence and sense of wonder that creates an inevitable yearning for youth. Neuman ties together his characters’ thoughts with an effective and chronologically elastic narrative, which magnifies the already staggering emotional and technical depth of his unforgettable “Talking to Ourselves.”
The novel has a lot in common with Faulkner’s “As I Lay Dying.” Both books juxtapose the styles and methods that family members use to deal with a parent’s illness, death, and afterlife and cycle at varying lengths between the protagonists. Both utilize confessional first-person narrative. And perhaps most significantly, both are centered on a journey. In Faulkner’s tale, Addie Bundren’s family encounters absurdity and intense danger on their way to bury their matriarch in fictional Jefferson, Mississippi. Neuman’s concerns a goodbye trip led by the dying Mario for his son Lito. The duo borrows Mario’s brother’s truck and embarks on a cross-country odyssey through an ambiguous South American clime—the unrecognizable place names, which are never explicitly linked to any particular country, are perhaps another nod to Faulkner.
Despite the lack of explicit spatial grounding, however, Neuman eschews other forms of surrealism or heightened reality. The father and son trip is sweet, if a bit too peaceful and restrained. More sensational plot elements certainly exist; Mario is fading fast and often seems on the brink of being too sick to continue the trip, while Elena strikes up a lascivious and experimental affair with Mario’s doctor back at home. Unlike Faulkner, whose novel’s plot takes on a biblical gravitas, Neuman’s story progresses with a sad sense of inevitability—there is little question that Mario will die, that the affair is ill-fated, and that Lito, who is left in the dark about his father’s decline, is in for a pretty big shock. The book is buoyed, then, almost exclusively by the ruminations and psychological developments of its characters. While this overt focus on interior processes should become tired, Neuman’s care and deliberateness in imitating thought and speech keep them just as exciting as any river crossing or grand conflagration.
Elena’s narrative is the most extensive and memorable. She combines ideas about illness, death, sex, and femininity from the many books she reads with the unraveling world she inhabits. Neuman, who presents her story in the form of a journal, embeds quotes from the likes of Roberto Bolaño and Helen Garner directly into his character’s thoughts, creating a startling but accessible collage. Unlike the remarkably brave Mario and childish but well-intentioned Lito, Elena is not particularly likeable. Her affair with Mario’s doctor, while initially a coping mechanism that appears entirely understandable, devolves into a power game that paints her in a vindictive light. Additionally, her obsession with writers seemingly acts as a crutch against her own emotional shortcomings. Neuman’s willingness to create a morally ambiguous main character is further testament to his understanding of the subtleties of the human condition.
Mario’s missives, which Neuman presents as tape recordings to his son while in a hospital bed, are both gorgeous and poignant glimpses into the contradictory simplicity and deep entanglements of impending death. On the one hand, Mario spends his time thinking about his pains, itches, and meals. On the other, he is profoundly afraid of death and has no faith to fall back on. Lito’s sections, which are made up of thoughts he experiences on the farewell trip, is a remarkably accurate exemplification of the mind of a child, complete with sudden ponderings about the science behind a shadow or a windmill. The organization of the sections is far from chronological; Elena’s tend to rush ahead into the future, Mario’s are fixed near the end of his life, and Lito’s are from the trip. The combination only serves to further highlight Neuman’s brilliance with emotion. Taken out of order, his story is no longer just merely a chronicle of a broken family, but rather a universal commentary on the nature of grief.

The newest freshman class of Harvard College—the Class of 2018—has finally been selected. Those lucky slightly-less-than-six percent of applicants offered admission will soon stride through Johnston Gate into Harvard Yard, where they will gape and marvel at the spire of Memorial Church, the colorful chairs casually relaxing on our less-than-green lawns, and the dozens of tourists that they will come to know too well. For the seven days after they set foot on campus in the fall, the class will be in the hands of the Freshman Dean’s Office, whose Opening Days program strives to bring new Harvard undergraduates up to speed on all things Veritas.
The burning question: Are students more prepared for success at Harvard after Opening Days? Though the FDO prepares some great programming, it would better prepare Harvard students for college by making the Bureau of Study Counsel’s “The Reading Course”—a four-week class dedicated to improving reading comprehension and speed—mandatory for incoming freshmen.
Incoming undergraduates, hailing from all across the world and all walks of life, display varying levels of proficiency in various disciplines, including the sciences, math, and reading and writing. Nationwide trends have shown dissatisfaction among college professors in regards to their freshman students’ writing abilities. Indeed, the quality of high-school science curricula nationwide is highly variable. Paul G. Bamberg ’63, the course head for the Math 23 series, has gone so far as to create a month-long “crash course” to combat inconsistencies in students’ mathematics education. In response to the problem, Harvard has instituted multiple versions of science classes to cater to all levels of preparedness, the aforementioned crash course, and Expository Writing to elevate freshman-writing abilities to an acceptable baseline. Reading, however, is curiously left out.
Reading is arguably one of the most important life skills. Experts attest to reading’s importance in obtaining knowledge and gaining command of material, and Bill Gates famously touts reading as what allows him to “understand more about the world”. Many have cited reading as a necessary activity to fully understand the human experience.
Unfortunately, as necessary as reading is, Harvard students don’t seem to do it very well. Amanpreet S. Kandola ’17 said that he has “trouble keeping up with the readings” for his classes.  He said he tries “to do as much of the readings as [he] can, but when there’s a midterm coming up or a paper due, [he’s] got no choice but to skip around a little bit.” Kandola ’17, who took Bamberg’s crash course in the fall, says that “the College should at least try to raise the baseline reading level of students.”
Indeed, Kandola’s sentiment about keeping up with readings is fairly common, and it illustrates the lack of a strong reading culture on our campus. Even at Harvard, one of the most intellectual institutions in the world, few students read as much as they should. Overwhelmed with problem sets, midterms, and obligations to extracurricular activities, few Harvardians find time for leisure reading. When did you or a friend last finish a book outside of class? Forget outside of class—students even find keeping up with course-assigned readings to be a tall order. The result is a compromised education: Even if students are able to regurgitate the main points of Nietzsche’s A Book for All onto a midterm, the actual knowledge those students have gained may pale in comparison with the deeper and more nuanced understanding that might follow a thorough reading of the work. Additionally, by not reading outside of class, Harvard student limit themselves to the literature that one discipline, or even just one academic, might find relevant.
The biggest problem with the lack of reading culture at Harvard is time. I believe that given a free afternoon and interesting literature, the typical Harvard student would gladly peruse a book. The situation as it stands, however, offers students no such luxury, and I cannot imagine that graduation, after which students must balance careers and possibly families, brings more leisure time. Additionally, the reading load might not even be significantly less post-graduation, with students-cum-professionals replacing class readings with relevant magazine articles, research articles, and the like, all of which studies estimate take up about two hours of reading per day.
There is a simple solution to limited reading time: speed-reading. Though the average college student reads at about 450 words per minute, higher than the American average of 300, speed-readers average 1,500 with acceptable levels of comprehension—and the speed-reading champion can read as quickly as 4,700 words per minute. Could you imagine improving your reading speed by three-fold, if not an order of magnitude? You could complete your assigned readings for class, supplement knowledge in areas of interest by pursuing reference lists and linked articles, and maybe even have time for a fun novel over the weekend.
In a world where time is money and knowledge is power, being able to read quickly can contribute to a more successful life. Where scientific or mathematical acumen require months to develop, reading speed, which the BSC purports is doubled after its relatively short four-week course, would be a comparatively easy and crucial skill to equalize amongst new students. The FDO should mandate that all future classes take The Reading Course in their first few weeks of college so that Harvard graduates of the future can take full advantage of the wide world of knowledge available to them, if only they had the time. For the rest of us, the BSC’s course is only $25 for Harvard College and GSAS students.

In centuries past, Harvard’s system of half- and full-courses made sense. At one time, full-year courses were the norm, and the system accommodated half-courses without difficulty. Today, however, Harvard’s credit system is confusing and restricts innovative course structures. It is time for a change.
Fortunately, a proposal to modify Harvard College’s current system of academic accreditation looks to be moving towards approval. The proposal changes our current system of half- and full-year courses to a more nationally standard credit system, in which each half-course would correspond to 4.0 credits. We welcome the possibility of this long-overdue standardization of our credit system, as it promises to simplify administrative processes and provide students with more flexibility in their schedules.
The change to a credit system will allow students and administrators to more easily communicate their academic experience to those who are not familiar with Harvard’s academic policies. As pointed out by FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke, student loan companies, employers, and graduate programs must rely on the statement “on the back of our transcript[s] that a half-course is approximately equivalent to 4.0 credits.” Switching to the credit system will allow students to report a nationally standard number that represents their collegiate course load.
Similarly, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid already converts Harvard College courses into credits when they report to the Department of Education. Officially converting courses to credits will obviate a trivial conversion conducted by Harvard administrators, with no drawback in its daily operations.
Administrators would appreciate the change, and students would certainly not decry it: Dean Harris says that “students at Harvard College would be substantially unaffected” because a 128-credit graduation requirement still corresponds to four 4.0 credit courses per semester. We believe, however, that the change to a credit system would not just be neutral; it would be strongly positive. This new system will, in the future, open a new realm of opportunity for Harvard’s curricula and students. As Harris says in his proposal, the credit system has the potential for “courses that span non-traditional segments of time.”
Indeed, students would have the opportunity to round out their education by taking shorter, less time-consuming classes to supplement their schedules. An engineering student burdened with 16.0 credits of math and science courses could opt to enroll in a six-week survey course on ethical literature, worth 2.0 credits. Perhaps Wintersession could continue to grow by offering a week-long cooking course, worth 0.5 credits. With this system, students can explore interesting material unrelated to their concentration, even if enrolling in the full-time course has been rendered impossible by concentration requirements.
Though our campus is notorious for its unique nomenclature—Proctors, Teaching Fellows, and Concentrators—changing courses to credits is a switch that is more than semantics, and could make a very real difference in students’ lives. While having evaluation committees or Harvard offices convert courses to credits is certainly not a great burden, reporting coursework as credits is simpler and more flexible. The change being contemplated is, for now, purely a mathematical conversion, but it opens up new possibilities. We encourage the faculty to adopt the credit system without delay.

As the United States works to continue the Israel-Palestine peace talks in the Middle East, some suggest the release of Jonathan Pollard as a means of ensuring the continuation of the process. Proponents of this plan argue that it will reflect the Americans’ stake in peace as well as prompt compromises from other parties. But considering freeing Pollard raises a broader question: When is it acceptable to release a prisoner? What role should politics play in determining a prisoner’s ultimate sentence?
The Middle East peace process is critical, and it is important that all sides compromise. But the American government needs to consider the overarching message that it would send to both its citizens and the international community if it frees a prisoner simply because it would achieve a political goal.
I’m not discussing whether Pollard should remain in jail. That’s a different question that centers on America’s foreign policy, its legal views of spies with allegiances to its allies, and considerations regarding the length of Pollard’s sentence. But I do believe that he should not be freed simply by virtue of his worth to the Israeli government.
While freeing Pollard would send a positive message to players in the Middle East, it would concurrently send a very negative one to Americans. It would suggest that the justice system in our country ultimately answers to political maneuvers, which are more important than the concept of absolute justice. Under this system, prisoners are not weighed on the basis of their crimes, but instead on their usefulness to the government as political pawns and weapons. 
This type of double standard would skew our justice system by bringing political considerations into the courts. For our system to work, the fundamental principle must be that criminals will be equally and appropriately punished for their crimes regardless of who they are. Justice needs to be applied both blindly and uniformly.
Only with this standard of legal equality can citizens have full faith in their government. Citizens should be able to be confident in the fact that if someone else is brought to justice, he will be rightfully tried and, if found guilty, sentenced to the appropriate punishment.
One could potentially argue that as a spy, Pollard is a political prisoner, by definition separate from other crimes. But espionage and the revelation of American secrets is, while not directly an attack on another person, certainly an attack on the country and could critically threaten national security. As such, his crime should not be seen as a case wholly separate from other criminals. Instead, in order to ensure that government figures and others who can see classified government documents do not leak them to other countries, espionage should not be dismissed as insignificant, and those who engage in it should face the full length of justice that the courts and the government deem necessary.
Perhaps the central exception to this rule would be the exchange of political prisoners, which I see as different from the Pollard case. In 2010, for instance, following the discovery of a ring of Russian spies, the United States exchanged them for Russian-held prisoners accused of spying for the United Kingdom and the United States. But the freeing of these prisoners cannot be compared to the release of Pollard. Arranging a prisoner swap implies that all individuals are considered guilty, but that in order to free our own people we are willing to return some prisoners to their home countries. It is not about letting someone free to further a political goal, but about valuing the lives and freedoms of our own citizens above almost anything else. 
In addition to the negative message that freeing a prisoner as part of a political maneuver would send to the American people, it would also be deleterious to America’s relations with other countries. If foreign nations understood that people from their countries or associated with their governments would be exempt from basic American law if they were sufficiently politically important, their behavior could dramatically change. Countries with political clout may feel more secure about their spies in the United States, knowing that if any were caught, the government could push to have them freed as part of any range of political agreements, not merely those contained in the field of espionage. Instead, countries must know to operate under the assumption that in general, any individuals caught spying will be held until their sentences are complete.
That’s not to say that anarchy would develop and blatant disregard for American law would ensue. But it does suggest that the concept of a double standard would be born, which could have ramifications both domestically and internationally. Our justice system prides itself on being an unbiased and impartial one. To the best of its ability, the government should work to ensure that it stays that way.

It’s a strain against my nature to be a specialist. In light of this, general knowledge has always prevailed over talents, integration over searing focus. A hyper-fox with a pet hedgehog (actually). When I signed on to write a thesis for my Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations degree, it was only through my excitement about the topic that I was able to get past the trepidation. Would I honestly be able to allocate the balance of my mental resources to one massive project? And if yes, would I even want to?
 
Given the choice between focus and failure, I soon forgot about these questions and buried myself in outlines, microfilms, and scans taken at archives across the Atlantic. I let my other classes melt into a chopped-up slurry of assignment, to be processed piecemeal for minimal distraction.
 
J-term ratcheted up the strange undertaking by wiping the slate clean and leaving me for a month with only one roommate, a fellow thesis zealot, barricaded at my desk in the midst of the polar vortex. When days would go by without measurable progress, I’d become convinced, as I was warned I would, that the project was on the verge of implosion. And yet a few days after end of the month, a full draft had materialized under my eyes almost unconsciously. The last leg was smooth sailing, provided there was enough caffeine in the engine. (Now finished, I’m trying to fool myself with decaf).
 
When I turned in my thesis last month, the world seemed to exhale deeply. A great monomania, the like of which I’d never imagined possible, had evaporated, leaving a gaping hole that one’s supposed to think of as room to explore. And yet aside from the standard-grade senioritis—it’s not you, Gen Ed professors, it’s me—I found myself at a loss for what to do with my freedom.
 
Despite the freakish pile of library books at the foot of my shelf, I’ve gotten through almost nothing, save for most of Nicholas Taleb’s The Black Swan and a new book on the collapse of the Mediterranean Bronze Age (a dorky read of least resistance for me). I am hardly any better about social media and e-mail distractions than I was before my monomania. I try out a few dozen projects a day—trying to read more Whitman, play darbuka, and finally learn something useful about computers—and revisit them, only to have made haphazard progress at best. The world cries out for order in the midst of freedom—is senior spring the time to finally routinize? Should I go back to my thesis and try to get it published?
 
The coming of Spring has changed the game. Neighborhood wandering and bike trips out to Walden Pond have become possible, meaning that there are now options for immersive fun better than articles, books, and intoxicants. Focusing on the fundamentals has never been more intuitive. Looking to shake out new friends from the woodwork of this campus is quixotic; focusing on the ones whom I missed in my thesis vortex is life-affirming. New languages have a place in the next stage of my life; for now, I’ve got unfinished business with the old ones.
 
If my flirtation with hardcore monomania had come earlier—early childhood, let’s say—perhaps the thesis (or its four-year-old equivalent) might have changed me. But no half-year research project can break and reinvent old patterns of operation. If anything, the overwhelming desire to generalize shines clearer after the temporary monomania has passed—and without serious initiative to focus and relax, can become burdensome. Life now is neither one-tracked or chaotic. Now what?

As one of the inaugural recipients of a Twitter Data Grant, a team of researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital will study new methods of detecting outbreaks of foodborne illness.
Last week, Twitter awarded privileged access to its data to six research teams across the world, according to an announcement on its Engineering Blog. The Harvard project, led by Associate Professor of Pediatrics John S. Brownstein, is the only one focused on disease detection.
The project builds on a growing branch of public health that uses Internet data to help detect and prevent disease outbreaks. Researchers have combed a number of data sets—Google and Wikipedia searches, Facebook likes, and Yelp reviews—for indicators that can inform disease detection.
Twitter offers an advantage over other data sources by enabling public health officials to not only collect data but also follow up with people, according to Brownstein. He cited a project called Foodborne Chicago, which automatically sends the city public health complaint form to Twitter users who mention possible symptoms, as a model.
Until recently, research using search engines and social media had focused on the flu, according to Brownstein. A recent paper in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that of 32 relevant studies, only four dealt with foodborne disease.
Brownstein said that gastrointestinal illness is an "area that's ripe for using these new technologies, because people tend to describe these illnesses [online]."
Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control recently released a report, which documented that foodborne illness remains a significant public health issue in the United States.
Some scientists have challenged the usefulness of aggregated social media data for addressing such problems. Two recent studies call into question the most well-known example, Google Flu Trends, which claimed to provide accurate detection of influenza outbreaks through search data. Those studies claimed that Google missed a significant outbreak in 2009, and often predicted much higher levels of illness than actually occurred.
 
Donald Olson, a research scientist in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene who authored one of those studies, said that secondary data "doesn't allow public health to do what public health needs to do."
To use the information, public health officials need to be able to follow up with a person to determine whether a tweet about vomiting after eating at a restaurant is an actual indicator of foodborne illness, according to Olson.
Olson said big data projects should be "evaluated in the context of actual public health practices, and that almost never happens."
Still, Brownstein said that the work of data aggregation researchers is meant to augment existing public health surveillance systems, rather than replace them.
"It's absolutely not a holy grail," he said. “And it's definitely not a replacement."

Eight graduate students presented research on topics ranging from methods of locating extraterrestrial life to the possible use of aspirin as a treatment for breast cancer at the Harvard Horizons symposium on Tuesday in Sanders Theatre. The audience included University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and Xiao-Li Meng, the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as well as other members of the Harvard community.
Launched last year by East Asian Languages and Civilizations department chair Shigehisa Kuriyama ’77 and other GSAS affiliates, the symposium recognizes the innovative research endeavors of a select few graduate students each year. 
Students from all academic fields had the opportunity to submit their research in the hopes of being a part of this year’s symposium. After being selected in February from a large pool of applicants, presenters collaborated with advisors, working to condense and communicate their research in five-minute presentations for the symposium.
The presenters chosen by the Harvard Horizons Selection Committee come from a wide array of academic disciplines. 
David P. Roberson, a neurobiologist who spoke Tuesday, presented research on “a magic bullet for pain and itch” based on manipulating local anesthetics. Adam Anderson, who studies Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, spoke about his applications of “big data” techniques to the analysis of ancient Assyrian social networks. Another presenter, Ashok A. Kumar, discussed the use of car batteries to tackle sickle cell anaemia.
Faust praised the students chosen for their hard work and groundbreaking research.
“The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences represents the highest aspirations of higher education,” Faust said. “These are women and men who represent the future of knowledge and indeed the future of universities.”
Audience members interviewed after the symposium said they found the presentations engaging. Some said they appreciated that the program offered people the opportunity to broaden their academic horizons and learn more about fields that they would not have investigated on their own.
“I thought it was really inspiring,” said Shristi Pandey, a graduate student studying genetics at the Medical School. “It was cool to learn about disciplines outside of my own field.”

A female undergraduate was assaulted by an unidentified man early Monday morning as she walked on Beacon St. in Somerville, several blocks north of campus. Steven G. Catalano, spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department, sent a Community Advisory email alerting the student body of the incident on Tuesday evening.
Around 1:20 a.m. Monday, the undergraduate alerted the Somerville Police Department that the man had grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into a nearby alley, according to Catalano’s email. The undergraduate said she yelled for help and fought off the male attacker.
According to the Community Advisory, no suspect is in custody and the victim was unable to identify the attacker’s features or the direction in which he ran.
The incident is currently under investigation by the Somerville Police Department, which could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.
Catalano, who declined to give more information on the incident Tuesday night, wrote in his email that the community should be aware of the risks that come with living in an urban area.
“Community members should be vigilant while walking throughout campus and surrounding areas both during the day and at night and to take appropriate precautions,” Catalano wrote. “If you are out after dark, try to travel in groups, use only well-lit routes or designated pathways, and do not allow yourself to be distracted by phone calls or by using ear buds.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow hosted an early screening of “The Case Against 8,” an HBO documentary about the appeal of California’s now overturned ban on same-sex marriage, on Tuesday night at the Law School.
The documentary, which will begin playing in theaters in June, follows the legal team and the two homosexual couples who appealed Proposition 8, a 2008 referendum that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Theodore B. Olson, a lead lawyer on the case and the former solicitor general of the United States during George W. Bush’s first term, attended the event and discussed the process of overturning the proposition.
Before the film screening began, Minow praised the film and the legal work it documented.
“As a teacher of family law for years, I used to teach this subject [and] courts would reach for dictionaries—that’s how they would resolve the subject,” Minow said. “You’ll see much more interesting lawyering happen here.”
Two former adversaries united to form the case’s legal team. Olson, widely known as a conservative, joined the legal team of David Boies, who had previously argued against and lost to Olson in the landmark Supreme Court case of Bush v. Gore. Olson has argued 60 cases before the Supreme Court, including the controversial Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case.
The unlikely team joined the American Foundation of Equal Rights and two same sex couples to file an appeal in California in May 2009, claiming that it is unconstitutional to take away an individual’s right to marriage. The plaintiffs were Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, whose previously legal marriage was deemed void in California after the passing of Proposition 8, and partners Paul Katami and Jeffrey Zarrillo.
After a series of appeals, the Supreme Court ruled in their favor on June 26th, 2013, striking down Proposition 8.
“I feel very strongly that conservatives believe in liberty and freedom and association and privacy and the building of families and the building of relationships,” Olson said. “At the end of the day, those are American values.”
Paul T. Cappuccio, a Law School graduate and the general counsel of Time Warner Inc., also answered questions and discussed HBO’s effort to make this film readily available to the public, which is unusual for the network.
The audience was full of law students, some of whom made time for the event despite impending final exams.
“It was something that we didn’t want to miss, even though its finals crunch time,” said third-year law student Chelsea P. Handler. “You’ve seen a lot about the case on television, but you don’t really see the emotions behind it, and so I thought it was a unique perspective.”
The documentary will begin playing in select theaters on June 6th and will air on HBO beginning on June 23rd.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg discussed the role of empathy, childhood, and toy trains in his works during a discussion with humanities professor Homi K. Bhabha at the Loeb Drama Center Tuesday evening.
After introductions by President Drew G. Faust and Bhabha, who is the director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, Spielberg discussed the obstacles he faced during the beginning of his career.
“When I was a television director, I was desperate to get a job,” Spielberg said. “I didn't have the freedom to pick and choose films I could identify with…. I didn't discriminate.”
While his first feature film debuted in 1968, Spielberg said his experience behind the camera began long before then, when he would record crashing his Lionel train sets on his father’s 8-millimeter Kodak camera as a boy.
This experience, as well as his growing affection for destruction, would go on to influence works such as Duel and Jaws. When asked about the difficulties filming shark attack scenes in Jaws, Spielberg said that planning ahead was important.
“What I think is essential for filmmakers to really learn how to do is see the scene first in their head, figure it out, even almost mathematically, and then go out and shoot it,” he said.
Spielberg also discussed the role of his personal experiences in his films, citing the importance of his parents’ divorce in the creation of E.T. According to him, the film simply began as a divorce story and of a childhood lost.
When Bhabha asked Spielberg about his decision to include an alien in the story, Spielberg gave two explanations: the constant presence of science fiction throughout his childhood through his father, and the symbolic role E.T.’s physical form played in the movie’s message.
“If you could learn to love something that looks like that, then that opens up your empathic pathways in all directions, including healing and repairing the damage done in a divorce,” Spielberg said.
After discussing the inspirations for different movies, Bhabha shifted the discussion towards the role of cinema itself. Referring to cinema as a “fathering force” that knits people together, Bhabha asked Spielberg what he thought the effect of cinema will be in the future.
“I think movies, in some form or another, as a public communion, will never go,” Spielberg said. “We’re always going to come together. Nobody in their right mind will watch a movie on their telephone.”
Some audience members, however, were a little more skeptical about the future of cinema.
“I don’t think we can predict where cinema is going,” said Ricardo C. Robledo ’15. “I really do think it will get to the point where people are constantly watching films on their phones.”
Addressing aspiring filmmakers, Spielberg stated that personalization can help keep the “spirit of film” alive.
“You just have to find some way to communicate who you are [through] your films,” Spielberg said. “There’s no one thing I can say. It’s a complete private choice you’ve already made.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: April 23, 2014, at 9:58 p.m.
Members of a recently formed coalition to address the issue of sexual assault at Harvard's graduate schools gathered Tuesday evening to craft their group’s name, mission statement, and plan of action, which includes analysis of sexual assault policies and an education campaign across the graduate schools.
The meeting of the coalition, now entitled Harvard Students Demand Respect, was attended by students from six of the University’s graduate schools—the Kennedy School, the Law School, the Business School, the School of Public Health, the School of Education, and the Divinity School.
Although groups at individual graduate schools had previously worked to address sexual assault and gender discrimination on campus, the coalition was created recently and comes after an op-ed published by The Crimson earlier this month triggered campus-wide conversation on the issue of sexual assault.
Last week, University President Drew G. Faust announced that that Harvard has submitted a revised sexual assault policy, the product of a working group convened last year to ensure that Harvard’s policies align with federal Title IX regulations, for review by the Department of Education. If approved, the revised sexual assault policy will mark the first time all of the University’s schools must comply with the same set of regulations.
Michelle Maziar, an organizer for the coalition and graduate of the School of Education, said that she believed there had not previously been collective action on these issues because the graduate school communities are generally isolated from each other. She said this new group will allow for activists to centralize and enhance their efforts at reform.
“Graduate students are two-thirds of Harvard’s student population,” Maziar said. “We need to be involved.”
Organizers of Harvard Students Demand Respect said the group differs in its mission from Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student group advocating for modifications to Harvard’s sexual assault policy. Harvard Students Demand Respect focuses particularly on the graduate student experience and has the broader goal of addressing gender-based violence and discrimination.
Still, Rory R. Gerberg, one of the coalition’s leaders and a student at the Kennedy School, said the two groups will be working closely together to advocate for adequate reform of Harvard’s sexual assault policy and to hold the University accountable for Title IX compliance.
“Our policy team will be looking at what [Our Harvard Can Do Better is] doing and how our work can complement theirs,” Gerberg said. Maziar added that she believes there is an “enormous void in responsibility and policy” in the way the administration handles and responds to sexual assault.
While the coalition expressed “cautious optimism” about the University’s recently submitted and revised policy, members still suggested that the coalition’s policy team continue to analyze current policies at the graduate schools, make recommendations for policy change, and propose accountability mechanisms to ensure implementation and compliance.
“Even though [the revised policy] has been submitted, we still need to put pressure on the administration to make sure this happens, and is just, and has what we want,” Maziar said. She said that she thought that the administration has thus far not adequately involved graduate students in its efforts to address sexual assault on campus, having included only one graduate student on its task force.
In addition to analyzing policy, the coalition seeks to launch an education campaign across the graduate schools and to increase public awareness of issues at Harvard. Liaisons have been appointed to facilitate communication between school administrators and Title IX coordinators.
“This is a really exciting time, and I think we’re going to see a lot of change,” Maziar said.

CORRECTION: April 23, 2014

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The usual afternoon calm of Maxwell Dworkin was temporarily disrupted Tuesday by a chorus of “HoneyBeeLujahs,” as members of the activist group known as the Church of Stop Shopping descended upon the third floor of the building to protest a scientific research project focused on creating and studying insect-like robots.
Activist Bill Talen, also known by his stage name “Reverend Billy,” led his singing troupe of about ten people to protest the research endeavor, which he called a “death-y project.” The protest began at about 2:45 p.m. and continued for 20 minutes. According to its website, the Church is a “radical performance community” based in New York City which performs—often in the style of a religious revival meeting—in a variety of public spaces, clubs, and concert halls.
The research project, known as “RoboBees,” is led by engineering professor Robert J. Wood and involves researchers from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In creating tiny flying robots, the researchers aim to better understand, among other topics, flight mechanisms, internal sensors related to flight, and the accomplishment of colony-level collaboration, according to the RoboBees website. The project celebrated its first controlled flight in August 2012, and is supported by funding from the National Science Foundation.
Dressed in all white and surrounded by a choir of his followers in bee and flower costumes, Reverend Billy spoke in solidarity with the honeybee via a megaphone, asking his followers to “give me a Honeybeelujah” in praise of the creature and blasting RoboBees researchers for conducting “science that assumes the honeybee will be extinct.”
In a flyer distributed by the protesters, the Church—temporarily renamed the “Church of the Honeybeelujah” for the protest—alleged that that funding was tainted by influence from Monsanto, a biotechnology corporation. The flyer places the blame for the current honeybee population decline on pesticides developed by the corporation and claims that the federal government had been “Monsanto-ized” into supporting the development of the RoboBee as a “non-response” to the issue.
Wood could not be reached for comment.
William Z. Chen ’14, who observed the protest from its start, said that he “tuned out [the protesters’] actual message” and thought it was “very amusing.” He said that he first learned of the protest while studying in the building and initially tried to ignore the noise because he believed it was a “really annoying choir-a-gram.”
Standing in front of what Chen described as a group of 15 to 30 people, Reverend Billy called on the researchers to “stop it, and stop the people around you” and asked those gathered to “shout out, I love the honeybee for what it is.”
The group’s flyer, which lambasts “the vision of Robobees” as “Blade Runner crossed with Hell,” also includes the location of the choir’s next “family friendly and affordable” show in New York City’s Greenwich Village.

UPDATED: April 23, 2014, at 9:25 p.m.
 
Administrative Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison, the administrator who helped oversee the adjudication of last year’s Government 1310 cheating scandal and implemented reforms to the Ad Board’s structure, will leave Harvard this summer to become the dean of students in the college at the University of Chicago.
Ellison has been a member of the Ad Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body, for almost 12 years, and was named its secretary in 2005. He first joined the board in 2002 as Lowell House’s senior tutor, the equivalent of today’s resident dean position. Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister announced Ellison’s departure in an email to colleagues Wednesday morning.
“It’s bittersweet,” Ellison said of his upcoming departure in an interview Wednesday. “But I’m really excited about going to the University of Chicago. I think they’re going to give me some really great opportunities to work with students there and do it in a different way.”


According to Ellison, he will be overseeing undergraduate advising in his upcoming role at the University of Chicago. Ellison, who holds a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, added that though he likely will not be teaching, as he has at Harvard, he will have the opportunity to engage in academic research.
In his time on the Ad Board, Ellison has served on a number of administrative committees, among them the University-wide working group that was charged with evaluating Harvard’s sexual assault policies, convened last spring.
Ellison also sat on the Committee to Review the Ad Board, the group led by Pfister that released a report in 2009 recommending several changes to board policy. Several of the group’s recommendations, such as changes to the resident dean position and the use of hearing subcommittees within the Ad Board, have since become policy under Ellison.
Ellison’s departure comes at a point that could be a period of significant transition for the College’s disciplinary system. The Academic Integrity Committee has proposed the adoption of the College’s first honor code, and faculty are expected to vote on the measure at their upcoming May meeting.
If approved, the policy would establish a student-faculty honor board to hear cases of academic dishonesty, likely removing cheating cases from the Ad Board’s jurisdiction. In addition, the Academic Integrity Committee has agreed to recommend a review of the Ad Board’s disciplinary sanctions.
In an interview Wednesday, Pfister said that administrators have not yet found a successor for Ellison. His departure could be an opportunity to assess the organization of the Ad Board in the context of other possible changes to the body, notably the potential approval of the proposed honor board, Pfister said.
 
“Whenever there are these kinds of shifts, it’s often a chance to look at the system, look at what we have and see if there is a different way, alternative ways to organize it,” said Pfister, who chairs the Ad Board in his capacity as interim dean.
Pfister, who is also leaving his position this summer, added that he “can’t imagine that there won’t be a secretary” after Ellison’s departure.
Ellison led the Ad Board through the adjudication of Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory. In 2012, the Ad Board investigated roughly 125 students accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on Gov 1310’s final take-home exam, requiring about 70 to temporarily withdraw from the College.
During the Ad Board’s investigation, the contents of an internal email sent by Ellison advising his colleagues about counseling athletes and other students involved in the scandal appeared in the press, prompting administrators to secretly search the email accounts of resident deans to determine the source of the leak. Ellison’s account was also searched at his request.
The news of Ellison’s upcoming departure comes just two days after the announcement that another member of the Ad Board will leave the College at the end of the academic year. This summer, Adams House resident dean Sharon L. Howell will begin work as the associate head of school at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Gill, Mass.
After Pfister’s departure and the appointment of Ellison’s successor, the Ad Board’s two highest positions will be filled by newcomers to the roles.

A panel of three current NFL all-stars and a former NFL Player’s Association head discussed issues associated with race and justice in athletics during an event entitled “The Modern Black Male Athlete” Wednesday afternoon.
Pro Bowl players Arian Foster, Richard Sherman, and Larry Fitzgerald informally talked about the NCAA, philanthropy, and the ability of high-achieving African-Americans to inspire young people. Former NFLPA president Domonique Foxworth, who is currently a student at the Harvard Business School, also participated in the discussion. He had helped bring the players to Cambridge.
Harvard Prize Fellow Brandon Terry ’05 moderated the event, which included a lengthy  question-and-answer session. Audience members asked about affirmative action and the controversy prompted by Seattle Seahawks cornerback Sherman when he offered live comments following the National Football Conference Championship game in January, among other topics.
The Harvard Foundation, the Harvard Black Men’s Forum, and the Harvard Sports Analytics Collective co-sponsored the event, which drew undergraduates from across campus to hear from the NFL athletes.
While the majority of the discussion focused on the challenges that come with being a black athlete in the NFL, the group also directly addressed the undergraduates who attended the event.
“Right now, as I’m sitting here, I say that you all are the future of our society,” said Foster, the Houston Texans running back. “You’re the innovators and the movers, and that’s what I’m trying to be. I’m trying to be in your seat when I’m done playing football...to do what I have to do to push my generation forward.”
During the portion of the event that addressed the NCAA, the panelists commented that student-athletes ought to be better compensated. They also praised Harvard football players for choosing to attend a more prestigious university over other potential schools that might have offered them scholarships.
Beforehand, Foxworth stressed the importance of the sensitive issues they discussed.
“I thought that it was important to give these [panelists], who I know have strong views in these areas, an opportunity to be on a big platform and hopefully help to shape the conversation,” Foxworth said.
According to BMF Executive Program Director Tope A. Agabalogun ’15, the panel gave the audience a unique opportunity to hear top black professional athletes discuss key issues regarding racial identity.
“There’s a lot of stereotypes that come with being a black athlete and football player,” Agabalogun said. “[The panelists] can speak to that directly, and so we were excited to gain that perspective in regards to this intersection of race and image presentation.”
Just before “The Modern Black Male Athlete” panel occurred, the four panelists also spoke at the Harvard i-Lab, where they discussed the creation and commercialization of their public images outside the realm of sports.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, Harvard plays a pair of home-and-home doubleheaders with Dartmouth in a weekend that will likely decide the Ivy League title. In a rematch of last year’s penultimate weekend, the Crimson (27-11, 13-0 Ivy) comes in one game ahead of the Big Green (26-14, 15-1) in the loss column.
Because of scheduling complications due to inclement weather, this weekend will not be the final weekend of the Ancient Eight season for the Crimson. They still have two games remaining against Cornell, which have been rescheduled twice. They also had a game versus Penn postponed at a tie in the sixth.
“It has been really frustrating, and we haven’t really been successful getting them in in the scheduled time,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said.
That said, either the Crimson or the Big Green could clinch the North Division title this weekend. If a team goes 3-1, it will claim a spot in the Ivy League tournament. If the teams split, Harvard’s results against the Big Red will determine the final standings.
Harvard finds itself in a better position this year going into Dartmouth weekend than it did last year. In 2013, the Crimson came into the series a game behind the Big Green and needed three wins on the weekend to over take the title. The squad eventually lost three after winning the first to cede the division.
Before last year, the Crimson had won the Ivy League title in two consecutive campaigns, including reaching the regional final of the 2012 NCAA tournament.
Since the beginning of Ivy League play, Harvard has been on an absolute tear. After a poor performance in California over spring break, the Crimson has gone on to win 18 in a row.
“We’ve done a remarkable job staying focused game,” said Allard. “They’ve done a phenomenal job of not working ahead or behind. We’ve really had a focus on the process of playing great softball.”
The consistency can be attributed to the balance and the depth of the team. There are six Crimson hitters with double-digit RBIs for the season. Some, such as captain Kasey Lange, have produced highly, as expected. Others, such as freshman Catherine Callaway, have come in and shown that inexperience is not a hindrance. Callaway leads the freshman class with 13 RBIs on the season.
“Everyone has stepped up at different times,” said Allard. “As of late, [junior Emily] Gusse had a huge weekend for us with some key hits. She came out with a huge home run. Laura has been really strong on the mound. She has been able to keep us in a ton of games. Our pitching staff has been doing whatever it takes to get the job done.”
While the hitting has been varied and consistent, the pitching has been keeping the team on point. Every Crimson pitcher has an ERA under 3.00, or top 10 in the Ivy League. Junior Laura Ricciardone leads the entire league by almost a half run per game with a 1.48 ERA and 17 wins. Freshman Taylor Cabe has also posted nearly 90 innings for the Crimson.
Dartmouth also started the Ivy League season strong, going undefeated over its first 15 games. However, on Sunday, it dropped the second game of a double header to Brown, 3-1. The Big Green was undone by errors, which led to two crucial runs.
“Initially, we were very much behind Dartmouth in number of games, so although both teams were sweeping and winning, they looked to be leading us because they were ahead so many games [in conference play],” Laura Ricciardone said.
While Harvard leads the Ancient Eight in pitching, Dartmouth is the cream of the crop at the plate. As a team, the Big Green collectively bats just south of .300 while putting up 4.6 runs per game.
Dartmouth has also been balanced offensively, with eight players who have double-digit RBIs and five with at least 20.
The winner will likely move on to the Ivy League championship on May 3rd and 4th. Since both teams have better conference records than anyone in the South Division, the games would be hosted by the North Divisional winner.
“It is neck and neck between Dartmouth and us,” said Ricciardone. “We really love the position that we are in—we control the destiny we are in. This team is incredibly motivated. We really put in the work in the preseason.”

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (8-5, 4-1 Ivy) finished both of its last two seasons with a 6-8 record, going 2-4 in conference play. In NCAA lacrosse, the Ivy League is one of the most competitive forums in existence. Traditional powerhouses Cornell and Princeton, coupled with the emergent powers of Yale and Penn, make competing for the one guaranteed bid to the NCAA tournament incredibly challenging for any team in the Ancient Eight. This level of talent also makes it enormously difficult to generate an appealing resume for the 10 at-large bids that are given out.
The Crimson will finish this season having played 14 games. According to the computer-based RPI poll, the team will have played the second, third, fifth, sixth, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 17th-ranked teams. Both the Inside Lacrosse poll and the USILA DI Coaches’ poll show Harvard as having played against six teams out of the top 20.
Despite the hefty competition, the Crimson is currently 8-5 and sits atop the Ivy League standings with a 4-1 record, having already clinched a berth in the conference tournament. Additionally, two of Harvard’s worst losses, to unranked opponents UMASS and Albany, came without sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer, who is without a doubt a very important part of the Crimson offense, currently tied for the second-highest number of points on the roster, despite missing the first four games of the year.
The key to this success has not been the offense, however. In the biggest games of the season, the defense has stepped up and exerted a level of control over the game that has not been seen from a Harvard team in recent years.
Rewind back to the Cornell game, which the Crimson won 14-9 over then second-ranked Big Red.
At the time, Cornell had three players who were seen as possible contenders for the Tewaarton Trophy in junior midfielder Connor Buczek, senior attackman Dan Lintner, and junior attackman Matt Donovan. Each of these players averaged around four points per game coming into the contest, and only Buczek had a single game without a goal, a game in which he made five assists.
Against the Harvard defense, however, everything changed for the dynamic trio. Together, they recorded one goal, zero assists, and conceded six turnovers. The Crimson defense threw the Cornell offense completely off its game and was able to reap the benefits of that effort with the victory. Up until that game, Cornell was undefeated and had scored nearly 15 goals per game. Against the Harvard defense, the Big Red scored fewer than 11 goals for the first time all season, and watched its perfect season slip away.
Fast-forward to last week’s game against then 14th-ranked Princeton. Like Cornell, the Tigers also had top candidates for the Tewaarton award, chief among them senior midfielder Tom Schreiber. Schreiber came into the meeting averaging over four points per game.
The Crimson defense held the midfielder to zero points on its way to a 9-8 victory that both put Harvard into the Ivy League tournament, and knocked Princeton out of it. This was also the fewest points that the Tigers had scored all season.
So where does the credit for this defensive dominance go?
The answer to that question is complicated. This week, junior long-stick midfielder Brian Fischer earned the Ivy League co-player of the week honor for his work guarding Schreiber, and that was certainly well-deserved. However, the real answer lies in the cohesiveness of the entire Crimson defense.
Senior defenseman and co-captain Joe Petrucci has taken a group consisting of Fischer and a series of sophomore defensemen and turned it into one of the more dominant defensive units in the country. Sophomores Walker Kirby, Stephen Jahelka and Bobby Duvnjak have excelled under Petrucci’s leadership, and junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky has been very hot of late.
Together, these players have built up a defense that has earned a high degree of respect from programs across the country, and has put the team into a position from which it needs only two wins to reach the NCAA tournament.
And perhaps the most remarkable component of this transformative team is its youth. Of the team’s players with double-digit point tallies so far this season, seven of ten will be returning next year. All seven are sophomores. Defensively, many players will be returning as well.
This year, the Crimson shirked off its position as the fifth-best team in the Ivy League that it had held for some time, and seized the top conference spot during the regular season. While the team may or may not win the conference tournament this year, based on its apparent current trajectory, it will likely continue to be relevant on the national scale for some time to come.
The future looks bright for Harvard men’s lacrosse.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team improved on last year’s haul of one first team All-EIVA player and two second teamers by sending a program-best five players to the All-EIVA squads this year. Three players made the first team and two made the second team, as the Crimson posted a program-record 11 wins in conference play.
Junior outside hitter DJ White made the first team for his third straight year as he once again led the Crimson offense. The junior upped not only his volume, producing 3.37 kills per set compared to 3.19 last season, but he also improved his efficiency, as his hitting percentage rose from .314 to .325 in another first-rate season.
Co-captain Nick Madden made his first All-EIVA team as he was named opposite hitter on the first squad. Madden recorded four double-doubles for the season as he contributed across the court to both the Crimson’s offense and defense.
Junior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick moved up from making the second team last year to being on the first team this time around. The junior used his entire 6’9” frame to lead Harvard in blocks. Zimmick will be within sight of the all-time career record in several blocking statistical categories for Harvard next season.
Senior Kyle Rehkemper repeated as second team All-EIVA as another middle blocker. In addition to his defensive contributions, Rehkemper also has posted a hitting percentage of .453 for the season, acting as an efficient extra offensive option for the squad.
Last, but not least, freshman setter Nick Bendell made the second team as one of only two freshmen in the conference to earn All-EIVA honors. The setter was third in the conference with 9.91 assists per set and was recently named a freshman All-American.

We all enter Harvard Yard freshman year, wide-eyed and excited about all the possibilities in front of us. It’s not long, however, before sleep deprivation and stress strip us of our ambition and enthusiasm. Some ways to distinguish between a new Harvard freshman and a Harvard senior:

The battlefield was set. The sun was high, the day warm with anticipation. Two armies stood in wait. Two generals prepared to unleash havoc. The day would live on in infamy, known forever as the Battle of the Giant Chessboard in Front of the Science Center.
The general of the white army, Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, made the first move: d4. Sietse K. Goffard ’15 responded with d5, and the fury of battle began. But the action on the board was only half the story – both knew the real battle was psychological.
“I have thee stumped!” taunted Goffard at one point, as Mayopoulos puzzled over his next move. Later, after winning a pawn, Goffard told Mayopoulos in a Russian accent (I think), “Your pawn is very tasty!”
But Mayopoulos has some barbs of his own: “What do this season and my trap have in common? Both have been sprung! Da-dum-tsh.” Soon after, Mayopoulos announced with satisfaction, “And so the ruse is complete…is it? What was the ruse...?” The tension in the air was palpable.
After what seemed an eternity of bloodshed, the tide of the battle began to turn in Goffard’s favor. After making a particularly good move, Goffard laughed in triumph: “Ah ha ha! Or as we say in French, ‘Awh hau HAU!’” Mayopoulos was unfazed: “I watched G.I. Joe: Retaliation last night, so worst-case scenario I get in a helicopter and fly away.”
A crowd of onlookers had gathered around the board by this time. Though Mayopoulos’s troops continued to fight valiantly, in the end they were unable to protect his king from being checkmated. Goffard reigned victorious.
Afterwards, Goffard and Mayopoulos shook hands, hugged, and issued a challenge to Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper: a game of giant chess to decide the future of Quincy storage. “If he wins, then the status quo remains, but if he loses, all current and future Quincy residents get storage,” the duo proclaimed. It remains to be seen if Dean Cooper will take up the challenge.

 Happy Wednesday! To brighten your Wednesday today, here are a couple of unusual holidays that you can celebrate today:
National Picnic Day: Apparently today is the day to go outdoors and have a nice lunch with your friends! Plan to take a nice stroll with your friends to the river and enjoy a meal beyond the walls of your d-hall! And if the weather gets in the way, you can always pretend to have an outdoor picnic on your common room floor, right?
Talk Like Shakespeare Day: Put your high school English classes into good use today! You can start off with replacing all your “you’s” with thou or thee and adding “-eth” to the end of thou verbeths.
 IN THE ATMOSPHEREYep, you guessed it—two days of great weather was too much of a good thing. Today will have a high of 56 degrees, but it’ll be cloudy with occasional showers all day. Given that there's a 40% chance of rain, packing an umbrella would probably be a good choice for today!

Drum roll, please.
The College Board has recently released details of a new, revised, and, potentially, improved SAT. In a horrendously long and frightfully dull 211-page PDF file, the College Board divulged details of the upcoming SAT that will be introduced to the stressful, acne-prone, nail-biting world of college hopefuls in the spring of 2016.
The new layout of the test shows off a slimmer, trimmer SAT: instead of a grueling three hours and forty-five minutes of examination, the new SAT will be three hours long. These three hours of testing will include a 65-minute critical reading section with 52 questions, a 35-minute written language test with 44 questions, and an 80-minute math section with 57 questions.
In addition to those three bubble-filling, brain-straining, will-draining hours of examination, there will be an optional 50-minute essay at the end.  A question that arises from this new format is: why would anyone voluntarily partake in an additional 50 minutes of testing?
In addition to being a shorter test, the new SAT will lack the obscure vocabulary words that many students have spent hours struggling to memorize, using every medium from flashcards ripped from the back of their SAT-prep book to websites on the dark fringes of the internet.  Less known vocabulary words, such as dilettante—defined by dictionary.com as “a person who takes up an art, activity, or subject merely for amusement, especially in a desultory or superficial way”—and traduce—to speak unfavorably of someone—will disappear from the new test.
The innovative and fresh SAT, according to the New York Times has been commended by many college admissions officers for its, “effort to align the test with what students should be learning in high school.” It looks like, in theory, this new SAT will actually be doing its job as a test: it will actually be assessing knowledge that high school students are supposed to have. So, what has the current SAT been doing?
Whatever the new SAT looks like, a test is still a test, but, it really can’t get much worse than it is now… Right?
