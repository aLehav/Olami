After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the contemporary moment tells us anything, it is that the ongoing pursuit of justice requires as many hands and as many voices working together as possible. Solidarity benefits from numbers and volume. Every sign on the street, every institutional message of support, every dollar donated, and, yes, every dollar divested from unethical companies counts.
Here’s why we believe — against our earlier, rightly criticized precedent — that Harvard should divest from the prison industrial complex and particularly private prison management companies.
Let’s begin with the hard facts: Private prisons and the prison-industrial complex more broadly — a useful working definition can be found here — are at the core of the ongoing perversion of the justice system to control, exploit, and abuse Black people. Like the police — itself partially a historical outgrowth of slave patrols — they are a modern-day manifestation of the legacy of slavery, interwoven into the fabric of the American economy, society, and racist self-image. Private prisons and prison profiteering need to stop. And divestment is the best way for the University to contribute to that ongoing struggle.
The University’s typical response — that divestment makes the endowment dangerously political — just doesn’t cut it. Frankly, it’s disingenuous. First, the University has divested, if reluctantly, from morally problematic interests in the past. Its refusal to divest from immoral industries today is itself a political stance.
But second, investment practices are always political, for the simple reason that actions have consequences for other people and their well-being. No amount of institutional deflection, investment banking mediation, or market morality theory can eschew the basic truth that if an individual or institution puts resources towards an effort, it is supporting that effort and responsible for the moral consequences of its pursuit.
In reality, the University’s decision not to divest from the prison-industrial complex seems more likely motivated by a fear of losing control to student activists. The administration must wonder: Where does it stop? Once the tactic of divestment takes hold, every cause could adopt a strategy of calling for Harvard to divest.
We understand that concern. In our previous editorial, we wrote that private prisons did not meet our bar for supporting divestment. Faced with a number of divestment campaigns, we found it difficult to decide which was deserving of endorsement as opposed to any other. Where was the moral line? And was it really our place to decide? We were missing the point. And so is the University.
The question is not where to stop, but rather where to begin.
Now, more than ever, it is important to be open to changing one’s mind, redirecting an institution’s course, or deciding that statements of solidarity really do matter. If, for Harvard, prison divestment might seem financially insignificant — an $18,000 sum, according to the University, though disputed by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — but carry a big institutional cost, then it’s looking at things the wrong way.
The ongoing struggle for social justice requires rethinking the relative scale of our activism. That $18,000 will not buy Harvard a majority share in the Black Lives Matter movement, nor will it buy justice for the incarcerated people who are abused, exploited, and dehumanized in prisons. Rather, it will contribute in a small way to a broader social movement — one in which Harvard is one voice calling out for critical change, encouraging other institutions to take similar steps (though many already have), and normalizing an institutional commitment to justice.
Public opinion on issues of racial justice is shifting rapidly. Take police violence. In 2014, more than half of those polled saw the killings of unarmed Black men in New York and Ferguson as isolated incidents. Now, more than two-thirds of Americans see the killings of George Floyd and others as part of an endemic pattern and only 29 percent still believe these are isolated incidents.
Harvard has the opportunity to turn the inevitably political status of its portfolio from a source of criticism to a tool for fueling the current social and political momentum toward racial justice. By divesting from the prison-industrial complex, Harvard can help convince more Americans and more American institutions that these issues are real, systemic, and worth combating with real, economic choices.
But ultimately, there’s no high moral praise in these acts. Even this editorial is painfully late. And credit for it goes to the activists — in particular, HPDC — and the internal dissenters who called out the institutional timidity and shortsightedness that have until now prevented this editorial board and this University from taking meaningful steps when they might have been bold and forthright in the service of a just cause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
The Editorial Board of The Crimson recently ran an editorial calling for the abolition of the Harvard University Police Department. I believe this editorial may be a response to the renewed and increased calls for the abolition of HUPD. These calls undoubtedly echo similar demands across the country and come after of HUPD officers were seen monitoring a demonstration in Boston in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police. As a Black man, I was disturbed — but not surprised — that yet again an innocent Black life had been lost as a result of aggressive policing that systematically targets Black men in America. Of course, HUPD is not innocent of aggressive policing, but abolishing HUPD is not the answer to systemic racism in the criminal justice system, either for America in general or Harvard in particular.
Beyond sentiment and rhetoric, there are practical reasons for why abolishing HUPD would be nothing but an attempt in folly. One of these is that officers at HUPD do in fact protect our community. Harvard — a popular tourist destination located in a large urban setting — is specifically vulnerable to criminal activity.  According to NeighbourhoodScout, a comprehensive database that tracks crime across America, Cambridge is only safer than 19 percent of America’s cities. And while we may not want to accept it, illegal and criminal activities have been, and will continue, to be a hallmark of all human societies. There are people who will try to steal from the Harvard community, for example, as your newspaper has reported on multiple occasions. A police force like HUPD makes Harvard a safer campus, providing all of us with a platform to succeed. It is because we don’t have to worry about our safety that we can focus and succeed in our academic endeavors.
But aside from the practical reasons, abolishing HUPD would be a Band-Aid, not the cure to the issues that your Editorial Board outlined as justification for abolishing HUPD. I imagine that once the department is abolished, another police department, presumably the Cambridge Police Department, would be tasked with policing the University campus. I imagine that such an alien police force, without a strong connection to the school like the one HUPD has, would only exacerbate the very issues that drove your Editorial Board to call for HUPD’s abolition. Beyond that, consider CPD responding to a call on a Friday day concerning a drunk freshman in the Yard. One can only imagine how such an interaction would unfold.
We should not cut off our feet and expect to walk. Of course, broader conversations are needed around police reforms, and these reforms may include defunding the police and other structural changes. The efforts should be driven by empathy. The officers of HUPD are not our enemies. I am saddened, but not surprised, that rather than use this opportunity for a nuanced conversation on reforming HUPD, The Crimson Editorial Board opted to follow the passions of the masses. It is easy to say: abolish HUPD. But whatever institution fills the void that abolishing HUPD will leave will not be immune to the same problems that HUPD faces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates celebrated the United States Supreme Court’s Thursday decision to block the Trump administration from immediately dismantling the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and called on lawmakers to institute additional progressive immigration reforms.
DACA is an Obama-era program that allows roughly 700,000 children brought to the U.S. by their parents to live and work in the country, granting them protection from deportation.
Hours after the news of the ruling, University President Lawrence S. Bacow affirmed his support for the Supreme Court’s decision and for undocumented students.
“Throughout my career in higher education, I have met students of all backgrounds, abilities, and interests. Dreamers have always inspired me,” Bacow wrote. “Although they are denied legal status and have lived much of their lives at risk of sudden removal from our country, they have become undergraduates at colleges and universities nationwide, leading in our communities and advocating forcefully for change.”
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 and the four members of the Court’s liberal wing voted to uphold DACA in a blow to one of President Donald Trump’s primary campaign promises: to terminate the program.
Though many Harvard affiliates quickly jumped to praise the ruling, they also called for further action on lawmakers’ part.
“Congress should now turn its attention to immigration reform and provide a pathway to citizenship for these young people and others, including individuals with temporary protected status,” Bacow wrote in his email.
Graduate School of Education Professor Roberto G. Gonzales, who directs the Immigration Initiative at Harvard, referred to DACA on Twitter as “the most successful immigration policy in recent decades.” He added, however, that protecting the program was not enough.
“DACA has not been perfect. It’s not a pathway to legalization and it doesn’t address the circumstances of parents, spouses, and loved ones,” Gonzales wrote. “What is ultimately needed is more for more people.”
Act on a Dream — a student-led immigration advocacy group at the College — urged for additional measures, including the abolition of U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement, citizenship for all immigrants, and open borders, in a tweet. They hosted a rally calling for the abolition of ICE in September.
The group organized a walkout in November to demonstrate support for DACA the day before the Supreme Court heard the case on the program.
