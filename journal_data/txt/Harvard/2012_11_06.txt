'Dear Life' by Alice Munro
Dear Life, thanks for the scars and the marks on my knees. Thanks for a perfect first kiss, and a not-so-perfect first attempt to lose my virginity. Thanks for the affairs, and if I may ask: Why the hell did I marry Henry? He snores, and he has wrinkles. He has discolorations on his legs and arms and even you-know-where. Thanks for the countryside and the beavers. Thanks for the simple life. Sincerely, Alice Munro—your avid subscriber and chronicler of simple stories of simple people living in a simple town with simple worries.
 ‘Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm’ by Philip Pullman
Once upon a time Phil dreamed of two kids, a couple princesses, some witches, and a forest full of mysteries and magic. When he woke up, he called his publisher. “Fairy tales are outdated,” said Paul the Publisher, taking a sip from his Grande Soy Milk Peppermint Chai Latte. But Paul was obstinate. “Little duck, little duck, dost thou see, Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee!” he exclaimed. Paul the Publisher shook his pouch to hear the coins that Phil had earned him. The clinking had a sufficient wavelength to push a sound of agreement up from Paul’s voicebox. Thus, Philip Pullman rewrote the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm as they were re-conceived in his dreams, paying special tribute to the archetypes of Carl Jung. A pill-popping witch awaited the siblings Hansel and Gretel, running away from their vegan mother and virtually absent investment banker father.
 ‘Sweet Tooth’ by Ian McEwan 
It was the contrapposto that gave it away. She was being followed. Her weight supported by one leg, her mind lingering elsewhere. She had heard the footsteps approaching, and possibly her name being called by the mysterious stranger. What was her name? Sally. It had to be Sally. Sally was running away from him. He was drawn to her. Her red dress made her irresistible. He would have to come after her. She was so young and fresh but he had to pursue. Why had she worn that dress if she didn’t want him to follow? She had to hide the papers, hide her past, hide all the documents that would reveal that she had a sweet tooth for trouble. Living in the cover of the new Ian McEwan novel, she would have to desire and be desired.

College students are accosted every day with various assertions as to what, exactly, constitutes great writing. Yet rarely do those making the claims, as “Maidenhair” author Mikhail Shiskin does, proceed to demonstrate these criteria in a work of great writing. While “Maidenhair,” translated from Russian by Marian Schwartz, is a moving, complex novel, it is most effective as evidence of the factors that make a good story. Shishkin’s multilayered, unconventional narrative consists of the stories of modern-day Russian refugees seeking asylum in Switzerland, as translated by an unnamed interpreter. Alongside these stories are memories of the interpreter’s life and the various texts he reads throughout the story. This structure permits Shishkin to explore fully how to convey a story.  Although a subpar translation may occasionally obscure the beauty of Shishkin’s writing and compromises his carefully constructed tone, “Maidenhair” is as a whole a success, a potent, encyclopedic exploration of the art of storytelling.
At one point in the novel, a character states in defense of the false stories told by his fellow refugees, “Those speaking may be fictitious, but what they say is real.” This explanation occurs in “Maidenhair” several times, most notably and effectively in Shishkin’s constant integration of mythology. The characters in the novel, of course, recognize this mythology as fiction, but this does not compromise the sharpness and elegance of one refugee’s relation of the story of Daphnis and Chloe: Daphnis is “coming back to his room, which he shared with a medical student, when a premature rosy-fingered Eos had nearly begun.” Daphnis and Chloe exist in this world and experience the banality of having to share a room with someone else, but miraculously, despite this modern setting, the original beauty and art of their myth remains.
Partially through this integration of myth, portions of the novel, particularly the interviews with refugees, become fantastically thick with meaning. Some of the refugees make up plausible yet untrue stories (for example, that they were raped when they in fact were not, as occurs near the novel’s beginning); others craft stories that are impossible, claiming that they are hundreds of years old and have even, in one case, boarded the Nautilus submarine of Jules Verne’s “Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea.” They use language as improbable as the stories themselves; so, too, does the interviewer, as when he asks “Was it then, that wintry night in April, though still with a March putrefaction, that it all began?” This beauty illuminates intricacies of the plot, even though one would never in reality hear such intricate wording in spoken communication.
Were the entire novel composed of these interviews, the fantastical language and multilayered mythology might grow to be overpowering. Shishkin, however, integrates another form of storytelling: he includes in large quantities the fictional diary of a singer, now dead, who lived through World War I. The interpreter has found this diary in his workplace and during the course of the novel he reads it in its entirety. The singer’s language is simple, her statements factual, yet she deals with the same overarching themes addressed in the interviews and the story of the interpreter’s own life; her more simple language lends another, significant perspective to the discussion of love, death, and war of which the novel consists and prevents the work from becoming too abstruse. Shishkin possesses an acute sense of the length of time he can spend in artful, fantastical language, and knows when he instead needs to tell a story that is easily comprehensible. His balancing of multiple narrative styles is perhaps the greatest feat of his narrative.
For all that Shishkin does to craft a profound, beautiful work of literature, a potentially subpar translation occasionally disrupt the reader. While some disjointed word choices may be Shishkin’s own, they often seem more likely to be the fault of the translator. Though not incredibly frequent, they break tone and are thus quite damaging. One of the most persistent manifestations of the imperfect translation is the use of the word “guys” in formal contexts. At other times, the errors simply mar the artfulness of the writing, as when Schwartz translates, “The grass’s roots live on, oblivious to the fact that someone has already eaten it.” In the context of Shishkin’s generally superb writing, it is very unlikely that the clumsy wording was his. Fortunately, the translation is not horrible—the skill with which Shishkin writes is generally evident—and ultimately the thematic strength of Shishkin’s work is mostly unaffected by this translation.
“People have always suffered,” states the interviewer at one point to a refugee. “That’s not the point.” “What is?” responds the refugee. “Beauty.” Despite the occasionally shaky translation, Shishkin succeeds in proving this assertion. His book describes horrific war and profound loss, and yet the stories the refugees tell, particularly those that contain a strong element of fantasy, are deeply beautiful. It is through this exquisite writing that Shishkin has his most powerful impact on the reader. His words and ideas dance between obscure and childlike, yet there is never a point at which they are not well-crafted and illuminating. Shishkin not only states to the reader how one must tell a story: he shows it, and with a success that is not only edifying but also, quite simply, beautiful.

In a recent episode of “Modern Family,” a sleep-deprived Mitchell lets slip a careless comment that leads his adopted daughter Lily to believe her mom is a princess. As one would expect from a half-hour comedy, the situation is played for laughs. But the joke seemed to fall a little flat. This is perhaps because parentage is not something people like to see taken lightly. Even in “Modern Family,” the idea of a four-year-old mistakenly believing her long-lost mom is a princess comes across as more sad than funny.
A similarly upsetting situation occurs in “Kin,” a new novel written by Israeli author Dror Burstein and translated by Dalya Bilu. The story is grounded in several upsetting hypotheticals. What if a child and his adopted parent don’t fit? What if the child’s birth parents still question their decision decades later? In dissecting these prospects, Burstein presents a harrowing portrait of five people who are simultaneously islands unto themselves and inextricably bound. “Kin” is not a fun book to read, and falters when it attempts to take on issues that transcend its tiny cast of characters. But in prose that is gut-wrenching for its simplicity, the brilliantly realized characters grab hold of your heart and don’t let go.
“Kin” is a character-driven novel in which remarkably little actually happens. Burstein establishes the situation early on: In 1970, Yoel and Leah Zisu adopted an infant named Emile. Thirty-seven years later, Yoel is dying of cancer and tracks down Emile’s birth parents to ask if they will renew their relationship with their son. Interestingly, Burstein does not expand on this disturbing premise. It serves little purpose other than to ground the many chapters of self-reflection that ensue. The text proceeds to oscillate freely and frequently between the past, the present, and an apocalyptic future. The general arc of events is simple enough to prevent this atypical structure from creating confusion. The effect of this writing is that Burstein focuses the reader’s attention on the tiny cast of characters whose interior struggles form the heart of “Kin.”
Burstein is clearly most comfortable firmly ensconced inside his characters’ heads. It is when Yoel, Emile, and all the rest run up against the outside world that the unaffected rawness which lends “Kin” much of its appeal falls off. Passages that grapple with issues more universal in nature come off as heavy-handed and undermine the complexity of Burstein’s characters. This  problem is exemplified in a sequence of chapters in “Kin” that discusses Emile’s brief conscription in the Israeli army. Burstein’s description of Emile’s reaction to having his head buzzed, which attempts to make a general statement about the impact of the army on one’s humanity, falls flat. “Emile felt how his shorn hair was only the first step on the way to a deeper cut that the army was going to make in his soul,” Burstein writes, “how the scissors would enter into his mind and soul and cut and cut.” This is an apt metaphor, but almost a little too on-the-nose. What’s more, it does a disservice to the unique personage Burstein has created. Emile might think this, but then again, so might anyone else. Burstein’s attempts to philosophize about the state of Israeli literature and foreign policy are similarly disappointing.
Burstein also undermines the poignancy of his novel through experimentation with unusual literary techniques. A moving chapter that vividly depicts the numbing effect of grief is thrown off by Burstein’s sudden insertion of himself into the text: “And one of the children, whose name was Dror, and who wasn’t even in the same class, took out a new tennis ball and gave it to Emile. It was me.” One gets the sense Burstein is trying to accomplish something important here, but just what that something is does not come across. It is perhaps a comment on how people are all bound up in each other’s stories, yet this intrusion may make the reader feel confused and toyed with. If you’re going to plop yourself down in the middle of your novel unannounced, you’d better make your reasons for doing so abundantly clear and effective, “Breakfast of Champions”-style.
But these are minor complaints. Burstein’s minimalist, unornamented prose overall lends itself well to an examination of his character’s psyches. By limiting the content of descriptive passages to what is strictly necessary and utilizing adjectives with the same eye toward caution one might adopt when cooking with chili powder, Burstein enables his writing to portray the most realistic emotions possible. The pangs of guilt, regret, yearning, and pain so keenly felt by Burstein’s characters are all the more poignant and impactful for their bare-bones presentation. Towards the novel’s conclusion, Yoel recalls a young Emile shrieking at him, “I want you to give me back, I want to go back, take another child, take the sick one instead of me.” There is not one dressy word to cushion the blow; its brutal clarity is palpable.
This economy of style is also in keeping with the cognitive realism Burstein’s writing aspires to. Descriptive passages are frequently punctuated by streams of consciousness that are appropriately devoid of poetic frills. The reader’s ability to empathize with Burstein’s characters depends on these passages. Disjointed, frequently ambiguous, nonlinear, and thoroughly human, they invite the reader to look upon these men and women as more substantial than words on a page.
The most vividly drawn among these characters is undoubtedly Yoel. In keeping with the lack of verbosity that characterizes “Kin,” Burstein never gives a physical description of Yoel or an account of his background. Yet he is so well developed that these gaps are of little consequence. The memories that haunt Yoel and the feelings that torment his conscious are conveyed bit by bit through the chapters he narrates. Most affecting are his reflections on his relationship with Emile. On the surface, their relationship does not appear especially fraught: it is clear that father and son love and care for one another. Yet there is undeniably something lacking, an unidentifiable absence that is all the more upsetting for its amorphousness. And Yoel doesn’t know what is missing anymore than we do.
“Kin” is not a perfect novel, nor does its heavy subject matter lend itself to easy enjoyment. It is, however, supremely moving, and boasts characters more believably human than the vast majority of those jammed between bindings. These characters, in conjunction with Burstein’s stark prose, enable “Kin” to pull off the rare feat of communicating dark and often unapproachable ideas effectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked about his earliest Boston jazz memory, longtime jazz producer Fred Taylor replied, “Well, there were caves….” It’s a joke, but there is a shred of truth in it. Taylor is inextricably linked to Boston jazz history, with a career dating back to 1963 that has seen him manage the famed clubs Paul’s Mall, The Jazz Workshop, and the still-active Sculler’s Jazz Club. Taylor was one-third of a panel that met Thursday, November 1, at Harvard’s Barker Center. The other two panelists were local radio legends Eric Jackson, hailed as the “Dean of the Boston Jazz Scene,” and Steve Schwartz, creator and host of several WGBH jazz programs from 1985 to 2012. A noted jazz critic, Bob Blumenthal ’69, moderated the event while the three veteran promoters swapped stories of their colorful careers and discussed the future of jazz with cautious optimism.
Each of the panelists had his favorite stories of interacting with jazz greats. Jackson, whose father was New England’s first African-American radio announcer, had musicians in his house throughout his childhood. “My father was good friends with Duke Ellington,” he said. “My brothers were redoing the roof, and for some reason [Ellington’s drummer] Sam Woodyard decided to go up on the roof…a little tipsy. Someone literally grabbed him and said, ‘Man, get off this roof!’”
Other stories were touching rather than humorous, like Schwartz’s description of an interview he conducted with saxophonist Benny Carter. “I could tell immediately that he didn’t want to be there,” said Schwartz, “[but when] he realized I knew a bit of his history…he got warmer, and more friendly, and…when we were off the mic, he thanked me for such a good time.”
There was an air of sobriety to the panel when discussion turned toward jazz today. In June of 2012, Boston’s WGBH cut the majority of their jazz in favor of news broadcasting. Jackson still holds onto nine hours of weekend airtime, but the rest of the jazz programming, including Schwartz’s show, has been eliminated. Jackson is insistent that radio is essential for creating new jazz fans. “You are limiting yourself by just allowing yourself to listen to those songs that you have on your iPad,” he said. “Radio can be a whole world of discovery.” And he does not find the internet to be a suitable replacement for radio broadcasting because its use is often confined to a computer. “It just can’t really reach people everywhere,” he said in an interview with The Crimson.
But all three agree that the jazz world remains an exciting place. Schwartz said that Boston’s identity as a college town has helped cultivate a scene of exciting young players. He claimed that the changing ambitions of this generation of college students in Boston are inspiring. “These young kids are interested enough to pursue this music knowing that they’re not going to become millionaires or be on TV,” he said. This generational change could possibly keep the old genre from fading away.
Taylor agrees that the music itself is in good shape. “Jazz is alive, but in a different mode,” he said. “It’s not in the big major clubs so much, but there is a lot of little local activity.” Taylor references smaller venues in the greater Boston area such as the Chianti Lounge and the Acton Jazz Café. “The challenge,” he said, “is to get more of [the music] heard.”
Jackson agreed with Taylor. “If you’re playing [at a jazz club], that’s sort of like preaching to the converted,” he said. “Take the music outside, where people just walking by can hear.” Jackson said that with less radio, the jazz community must find new ways to “bring the music to the people.”
In fact, there is an entire coalition of people trying to do just that. During the panel, Taylor pointed out Pauline Bilsky, the director of JazzBoston, in the audience. JazzBoston is a jazz support network in the greater Boston area that, among other efforts, has brought jazz into Boston libraries and the Boston children’s museum. “We have programs for all ages,” said Bilsky. “For young kids, for an after-school program, for high school kids, and…a multi-generational program.” Yet Bilsky admitted that funding can be difficult to attain. “We struggle every time, every round, to get support,” she said.
The Harvard Jazz Bands showed their support for the music and the three local legends on Friday, November 2. Their concert, “Live From Lowell Lecture Hall: Harvard Honors Jazz Heroes,” featured pieces selected by each guest. Schwartz, who picked Charlie Parker’s “Yardbird Suite,” finds watching musicians play live to be one of his favorite things about jazz. “To watch the interaction between band members is just unbelievable,” he said.
Taylor, who picked a pair of Count Basie numbers, “Flight of the Foo Birds” and “Splanky,” responds most to the rhythms. “When I hear great jazz, my body is moving. It’s in me. I’m grooving to it,” he said.
And Jackson, who requested Miles Davis’s “Milestones,” has the cleanest and simplest reason for his love of jazz: “I heard it; I thought it was beautiful.”

What do you do when you’ve run away from a forced marriage to some butt-ugly hag and you’re in love with a country schoolgirl who is engaged to a local official you have to hide your identity from? Oh, and your father— who happens to be the ruler of Japan—talks with a British accent, despite his traditional Kimono. Director Katherine E. Moon ’14’s direction of “The Mikado: or, The Town of Titipu”—running at Agassiz Theatre until November 18—has some wickedly satirical answers. This operetta by the Harvard Gilbert and Sullivan Players is largely successful due not only to its talented singers but also the stunning scenery, which work together to bring out the work’s softly romantic charm.
Young Yum-Yum (Olivia R. Miller ’16), who loves Nanki-Poo  (Jason S. Friedman ’16) and doesn’t want to marry the town executioner Ko-Ko (Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16), has her right to wed Nanki-Poo challenged by the mature, ugly Katisha (Laura A. Peterson ’16). In the meantime Ko-Ko, who is really an ex-tailor and has no experience executing anybody, struggles to find a victim in time for the Mikado’s visit, since His Majesty has declared the act of flirting a crime worthy of capital punishment. Glorious mayhem, fit more for a British drawing room than a pagoda garden, ensues.
In terms of voice, although all the singers give commendable performances it is clearly Miller who deserves the most praise. As the leading soprano she maintains throughout a masterly balance of throaty vibrato, tonal control, and enunciation of the lyrics. She delivers an especially lovely solo in “The Sun whose Rays are all Ablaze” as she proudly rejoices in the consciousness of her youthful beauty. Similarly thrilling is Hilgartner’s baritone, and his acting of the hypocritical and cowardly Ko-Ko.
Eli E. Kahn ’13 has good vocals, but what really stood out was his acting. For the role of the deceptive Pooh-Bah, who embodies the play’s aspects of political satire and social snobbery, Kahn is delightful in his pontificating, insincere apologies. “I can’t help it,” he frowns, twirling his bamboo cane, “I was born  sneering!” Friedman combines his pleasant tenor voice with comic facial expressions. During the song “A Wand’ring Minstrel I” Friedman lands on the phrase “And dreamy lullaby” with sly raising of the eyebrows, which adds a hint of adolescent lust to an otherwise innocent song.
For projection and vocal clarity, there were nonetheless some parts that might have done better. Wankel’s mellow bass was so low and faint that it was occasionally hard to make out what he was singing. Camille L. Crossot ’16 had lovely trills as Yum-Yum’s sister Peep-Bo, but her soft voice, like Wankel’s, was often unable to hold its own with the orchestra. Olivia M. Munk ‘16, as Pitti-Sing (the other coy sister), has a clear, sweet voice, yet her delivery at times wants some embellishment and consequently her singing strayed from the territory of the operatic into Broadway musical. But these are minor faults in roles otherwise well played; the overall charming effect was unspoiled, thanks to great acting all around.
If it is still possible to harbor some reservations—however small—about the cast, there is no doubt that “The Mikado” has produced an impressive set design. Designer Matthew G. Warner ’13 arranged an extremely beautiful stage, with a landscape of artificial green turf and an inset river of blue fabric overhung with fake cherry blossoms. In the distance, there is small wooden Japanese pond bridge, which was very realistically designed. During Miller’s “The Sun” aria, light radiated from a moon on the painted backdrop. which contributed to the show’s delicate, fluffy atmosphere of romance; rose-petals came through a netting in the ceiling and showered the cast as they completed the Act II finale together. In the foreground, a traditional Japanese housefront is equipped with a porch and a sliding door.
Several props were also notably well employed to bring out the humorous or romantic-sexual undertones of the lyrics. Colored fans, for example, were excellently incorporated and used to full effect to emphasize meanings behind the words. For example, whenever a couple is about to kiss the lady leans into the man’s face while opening her fan in front of them. When the townspeople shun Katisha, they rapidly open and slap shut their blue and white fans at her as they chant, “Away you go!” Katisha, who holds a black fan, skulks away. The difference in fan color emphasizes her status as unwanted older intruder on the mostly young community.
The production has a lot of prettiness and a lot of very impressive professional flourish. But apart from its lovely pictorial quality, this “Mikado” deserves admiration for a wonderful realization of satirical possibilities.

Getting trolled is not always a bad thing. Sometimes, like in “Dearly beloved,” the last piece in “Counterpoint,”— a show presented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club in collaboration with the Harvard Ballet Company and the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company—it is disguised humorously as a way to remind people to not take themselves too seriously. After a whole show combining modern and ballet styles, such an ending leaves the audience members confused and questioning, with a slight inkling that they may have been lovingly trolled. “Dearly beloved” doesn’t seem to follow any sort of narrative, doesn’t match the music, and it ends with an unexpected Bollywood-style dance number and a burst of confetti.
However, “Dearly beloved” can be seen as a metaphor for the entire show; a refreshing parody of the seriousness that often comes with strict ballet or avant-garde modern dance. Instead of rigid lines and overdone metaphors, it reminds the audience that “Counterpoint” is neither expressly classical or progressive. Rather, it is a fun, innovative show that juxtaposes and synthesizes ballet and modern styles. The performance uses innovative multimedia effects and costuming to compliment the choreography and push the boundaries of both dance styles.
The first half of the show is full of mind-bending dance innovations. The opening piece “In fair Verona,” deviates from the standard ballet retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Instead of rigid lines and strict positions, “In fair Verona” uses both ballet and contemporary dance techniques to convey the narrative. Of the five scenes that comprise this reimagining, the second, “Love Duet,” is a modern pas de deux—or duet—between Melanie J. Comeau ’13 and Javier F. Aranzales ’16 and is one of the show’s the most memorable. Both dancers have gorgeous lines and technique. Aranzales skillfully partners Comeau, who executes her turns and extensions with power and precision. Even in “Juliet’s Death,” where Comeau, as Juliet, must convince Romeo that she is dead, her movements remain fluid and controlled at the same time, lending itself to a bittersweet effect.
This contemporary duet is followed by a much more traditional petit allegro. The dancers are all en pointe and perform a traditional ballet standard. Afterwards, there is a fight sequence that combines stage combat with modern dance inversions and partnering. All of these dances, when performed in succession, speak to the show’s overall theme of synthesizing the two styles.
“Counterpoint” does not just combine different dance styles; it synthesizes movement with other forms of media. For example “Safe Space”—choreographed by Julia Havard and Bex H. Kwan ’14—features a large white veil that both frames the dancers and doubles as a projection screen. Video footage of dimly lit streets is projected on the surface, and when the music begins, the dancers move in very frantic and eclectic phrases that communicate a suffocating, desperate, and unsettling feel. The video on the veil changes to footage of Harvard students rushing across campus, implicitly connecting the dancers and the students on screen. A dancer then emerges from the veil with a microphone and is partnered by a dancer. They dance together as she performs a monologue about the recent sexual assault on Harvard’s campus. As she talks about how she no longer feels like the University is a safe space because of the rapes, her partner ironically throws her around violently, contorting her body into twisted positions. This combination of dance and multimedia is successful in communicating a deeply profound and disturbing message that hits very close to home in the Harvard community.
The show also experiments with set pieces and costume design. “In creaturis choris” begins with dancers moving in very odd shapes. Three dancers enter with bent wrists and feet, and move around an elevated installation. This jarring phrase material is followed by three new dancers in black leotards wrapped in Christmas lights, creating a very odd but visually captivating experience. But at the end, the installation comes to life, and we realize it is a large-scale replica of a UV insect lamp.
However, much of the first half’s originality was lost in the second act. Most of the later dances rely too heavily on repeated group choreography and do not feature the same level of innovation. Despite the slower pace, the dancing is still top notch. In particular, Juan J. Aparicio ’15 and Talia M. Fox ’13 stand out during their duet in “The Secret Garden.” While Aparicio executes beautiful lifts, Fox luxuriates them in the air and takes her time, hitting every gorgeous extension and split.
Lackluster ending aside, “Counterpoint” is a collaboration between Harvard’s ballet and modern companies to create an enjoyable and thought provoking performance. The show compares, contrasts, and synthesizes the two styles, and the dances themselves use innovative effects to push the envelope of dance itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s rare these days for a relatively unheralded warm-up act to blow you away, but that’s just the experience I had two months ago at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston. I was there to see shoegaze behemoths The Jesus and Mary Chain, now aging and creatively exhausted like most ‘80s post-punk groups, though still apt to put on a great show. As I waited outside the club in the cold to show my ticket, I could hear coming from deep inside a loud, trembling wall of noise, interspersed with a deceptively delicate vocal performance. It was instantly compelling. It sounded like shoegaze, but it sure as hell wasn’t the Mary Chain. “Who’s that?” I asked the bouncer. “That’s the Vandelles,” he said.
I’ve now seen the Vandelles twice, at the Paradise and then a couple of weeks ago at the Deep Heaven Now festival in Somerville. Despite hailing from Brooklyn, they are regular fixtures on the Boston music scene and occupy a fascinating niche in the broad alternative-rock genre. Shoegaze as a genre too often seems to be in its twilight, the gorgeous soundscapes of the Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, and Ride having been superseded by epigones like Slowdive and Chapterhouse. Contemporary indie bands such as The Pains of Being Pure At Heart seem to labor all too dutifully under the burden of maintaining the ‘80s shoegaze legacy—the Williamsburg economy sustains itself mostly on reverb pedals—but the Vandelles are the first group I’ve heard who genuinely seem to be developing the form, pushing the boundaries, and making something new.
“You can go in so many directions,” says Honey Valentine, the band’s drummer, emphasizing the irreverent and at times playful approach the Vandelles take to their work. Valentine is the beating heart of the group’s sound, taking a central, propulsive role. Sometimes her drumbeats seem vaguely militaristic, at other times almost tribal.
The Vandelles as a whole dabble in other styles besides shoegaze. The guitar riffs are firmly rooted in surf rock, and lead singer and guitarist Jason Schwartz also cites psychedelic groups the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Black Angels as key influences. You can hear this in their music: it’s a kind of wispy, ethereal quality that’s hugely pronounced in concert. For example, on “I’m Way Ahead Of You,” airy harmonies float menacingly over a droning guitar, fusing together these disparate sounds to create something impressively distinctive.
The group’s show at P.A.’s Lounge for DHN was especially satisfying, with a more languid, laid-back vibe than that regularly produced by the occasionally sterile patronage at the Paradise. The Vandelles definitely operate best in an intimate setting; despite their shoegaze roots their music is playful rather than aggressive. P.A.’s was an excellent showcase for the group’s strengths: Schwartz’s charismatic vocal performance, a relentless rhythm section led by bassist Lindsey Ann, and a strong propensity for good, old-fashioned noise. This was exemplified in their single “Lovely Weather,” which is built on a delicious old-school riff, Valentine’s aggressive drum attack, and layers upon layers of feedback.
The Vandelles are currently on tour, but they should be back in Boston soon. “We have a lot of friends here,” Schwartz says. When they do, they’ll be well worth catching. Too much alternative rock today operates under the shadow of its illustrious ancestors; it’s refreshing to encounter a band that aspires to carve out its own tradition.

“People like to hear people analyze their own music,” says Avishai Cohen, calmly sipping an espresso before a sound check at Cambridge’s Regattabar last Thursday. “Today,” he says, “it’s like the better you talk about your music, the more gigs you’re going to get.” Yet the Israeli trumpeter doesn’t utter a word when he takes the stage later that night. The 34-year old Tel Aviv native silently saunters into the spotlight to exuberant applause, wearing an open-collared black dress shirt and a red tie dangling around his neck. His long hair has been pulled up into a bun at the back of his head, fully revealing his bearded face. There’s no flowery opening speech, not even a count off; Cohen simply puts his trumpet to his lips and lets the burnished-toned notes speak for themselves. Throughout the rest of the performance, Cohen speaks very little, instead letting his tradition-informed but fresh sound define his musical persona.
Cohen has spoken the language of music since early childhood. His siblings are both professional jazz musicians, and he credits his brother Yuval, a saxophonist, for dragging him into the art. “He used to come home and practice with his friend, who was a trumpet player,” says Cohen, who was so impressed that he eventually took up the trumpet to jam with his sibling. ”The joke at home is that I picked it because it looked easy, with only three valves. I wasn’t that strong at math, I guess.” Trumpet may have been more challenging than Cohen expected, but he took to it, ending up at Berklee College of Music and eventually in New York. It was there that Cohen became a rising star in the then-thriving jazz scene of the city.
“In a way, I caught the end of an era,” says Cohen of his time in late-90’s New York City. “There were still [jam] sessions going on, cats hanging at the bar until six in the morning. I used to go to bed at eight in the morning, almost every day.” Things are different now. While jazz conservatories keep pumping out swinging young players, New York has seen many of its hallowed jazz clubs, like Tonic, close due to a struggling economy and shrinking audience. Cohen thinks the musicians might be partly to blame; he finds much of modern jazz too intellectual. “If anything is way too brainy, it’s hard for me to listen to it,” he says.
Cohen has always eschewed overly mathematical melodies in favor of singable ones. Throughout his career, he accomplished this restraint through Israeli-influenced grooves driven by meditative piano and guitar. With his current ensemble, Triveni, which features a skeletal trio of trumpet, bass, and drums, Cohen attempts to achieve a similar level of accessibility in more of a pure jazz context. “What makes the group different specifically [from previous projects]…is that [in the past] the compositions were the main thing, and the improvisation was there to complete the composition,” says Cohen. “In this trio, it’s the other way around. The compositions are there as the point of departure for the improvisation…. I wanted to have that fresh feeling that welcomes you to just jump in.”
Indeed, while the instrumentation puts Cohen’s trumpet in the spotlight, the real fun comes from the exuberant interplay between Cohen and his supporting duo. At their Regattabar performance, it seems that bassist Ben Street and drummer Jeff Ballard know telepathically exactly when to fill in the gaps in Cohen’s solos. On Cohen’s original composition “Safety Land,” the first track on the group’s new album “Triveni II,” the group displays thrilling cohesion, with Ballard and Street seamlessly shifting between grooves and meters behind Cohen’s always swinging lines. It is this truly electric experience of group improvisation that Cohen attempts to and succeeds in imparting upon his listeners.
The stripped-down jazz of Cohen’s Triveni band showcases the accessible heart of jazz. He takes care to establish a musical rapport with the audience; on his spirited, plunger-muted rendition of Duke Ellington’s ballad “Mood Indigo,” he is unafraid to repeat melodies that are almost childlike in their digestibility. Yet even when his technical virtuosity is on full display, like on his performance of John Coltrane’s “Wise One,” his astounding runs through every register of the horn feel like a seamless wave rather than a barrage.
“I wrote in the liner notes when I made my last record…that I wanted to sound like Billie Holiday,” says Cohen. “If you tried to sing like her, it wouldn’t be simple at all, but she didn’t try. She just sang. And for me it goes straight to the heart.” Cohen’s music, too, seems effortless in a way, but at the same time, every melody, every idea, remains utterly intentional.

Aerosmith has been a well-loved name in music for 40 years. With 14 records, they hold hold two Billboard number-one albums, four Grammys, and ten MTV Video music awards. As their impeccable record clearly states, Aerosmith would be considered a pantheonic rock band even if they never produced another record. But, after an eight-year hiatus, they’re back to attempt to prove themselves once again in “Music From Another Dimension!” In looking to combine their distinct classic-rock style with the newer, alternative direction popular in rock music today, Aerosmith gives a good effort. While Steven Tyler’s prowess in expressing emotion is impressive, the disjointed production in a majority of the songs makes the album confusing and overwhelming as a whole.
“Music From Another Dimension” shows Aerosmith trying too hard to stay relevant in their hasty adoption of newer musical styles. In “Street Jesus,” the intro guitar riff, with its bluesy, staccato edginess, sounds more like The White Stripes than what we are used to hearing from Aerosmith. This intro is immediately faded out with a synthetic whine weirdly reminiscent of Skrillex, and the song transforms into a quicker and more classic rock sound, with heavier instrumentation and darker, more raspy vocals. Their attempt to mesh the distinctly different eras is laudable, but fails in its shoddy execution—the result is more confusion than modernization.
This confusion characterizes the album’s flow as well, as the drastic changes in style and sound between the songs tend to overwhelm. While many songs such as “Beautiful,” “Out Go the Lights,” and “Luv XXX” are similar in pace and energy to that of “Street Jesus,” randomly interspersed genre tributes seem helplessly out of place. “Can’t Stop Loving You,” featuring Carrie Underwood, turns to country. In the chorus, Tyler seems to force the twang to come out in the song, making the song feel like a bad parody of country music. “Another Last Goodbye,” the album’s final track, is a ballad that features a slow and somber piano. While a gut-busting guitar solo towards the song’s climax would be welcomed, as it was in the 1987 classic “Angel,” the band instead replaces it with a folksy and emotional violin solo. This addition feels clumsy and makes the song feel stranded from the rest of the album.
Despite the disconcerting aspects of the production and the songs themselves, the talent that Tyler displays in this album is absolutely undeniable. Even when compared to the screech that made him famous in “Dream On” in 1973, these vocals from the 64 year-old have certainly withstood the test of time. In “We All Fall Down,” the heavy-handed production that characterizes most of the rest of the album is relaxed to a soft piano and a quiet and perfectly placed guitar riff, which together allow Tyler to subtly but surely build up his vocals in the verse. When the production stops altogether, creating a moment of tension, the song begs Tyler to bust into his trademark high-pitched and powerful vocals. Sure enough, all is satisfied, as Tyler forces emotion through his buttery tone, which is combined with the perfect amount of raspiness. Toward the end of the song, after the chorus has been repeated a few times, Tyler’s power reaches its climax as he once again perfects a screech that is paradoxically abrasive and beautiful.
While the production of the songs make the majority of the album difficult to listen to, the album isn’t utterly lost. When the production, and thus the confusion, is relaxed, Steven Tyler’s utter vocal brilliance helps remind us why Aerosmith has seen so much success.

In 431 B.C.E., the Greek playwright Euripides took home last place at the Dionysia festival in Athens for his play “Medea.” Despite the original critical panning, “Medea” has gone on to become one of Euripides’ best known plays. Harvard BlackC.A.S.T.’s revival of the millenia-old work, staged in the Cabot House Theater through Saturday, November 3, attempted to channel the original with flowing tunics and a set flanked by columns. Despite these efforts, however, the production failed to channel the emotional power that has allowed “Medea” to endure. The play’s grand speeches and demand for intense performances proved too much of a burden for the largely weak cast, resulting in a play that drowned in its historicism, unable to gain much emotional purchase in the present day.
The power of “Medea” comes in large part from its notoriously haunting story. After falling for Jason (Tshepo Malete ‘14), the famed leader of the Argonauts,), the enchantress Medea (Jennifer L. Berrian ‘16) journeys with him from her home in Colchis back to Greece as his wife. Their life together is happy until Creon, the King of Corinth (Matthew S. Williams ‘14), offers Jason his daughter’s hand in marriage, which he accepts. Furious at her husband for abandoning her, Medea devises a twisted revenge: to kill the princess and her father and murder her own two sons. Typical of classical Greek tragedy, many of the lines are written as long, formal monologues, and it takes skill on an actor’s part to breath life into them.
Unfortunately for this production, it was a skill that many of the actors lacked. Malete’s Jason, for example, had none of the swagger or confidence of a conquering hero, and his emotional range was painfully limited. Malete did succeed in some parts—such as when his anger finally boiled over at Medea’s harsh castigation—but most of his performance lacked this depth of feeling. Even at the death of Jason’s bride-to-be, the most he could muster was vague annoyance. And the chorus of Corinthian women (Jenifer A. Brown ‘15 and Aly G. Martinez ‘13) was not much better. In Greek drama the chorus, as a representation of the people of the city, breaks up the action of the play with philosophical observations and moral judgements. However, in this production, the poetry and tragic beauty of the original script was marred by unnatural pauses and emphases. Martinez and Brown recited their lines without conveying to the audience the weight of their words: when Medea coldly plots the death of Jason’s new wife, they respond with only the feeblest objections. The directing didn’t help their case, either: they roamed through the audience aimlessly, and they delivered the final lines of the play while walking down the central aisle and chanting in unison dully like the Grady twins from “The Shining.” Euripides is known for his nuanced psychological understanding of his characters, but you wouldn’t know it from these performances.
The costuming only accentuated the cast’s weaknesses. While some of the tunics (notably those of the chorus) looked sleek and glamorous, Berrian’s was a mess—the hem was frayed in some places and puckered in others, and she was in danger of tripping over it several times. While this could be interpreted as a directorial decision that underscored Medea’s outsider status in the city of Corinth, it seriously undercut her dignified air.
The play’s acting was by no means universally bad. Berrian did her best to keep the show going when it stumbled, and she deftly channeled the various facets of Medea’s persona. It would be easy to characterize Medea simply as evil—and indeed, Berrian’s wicked facial expressions when she was hatching her plans were excellent—but the actress gave equal weight to Medea’s desperation and grief, rounding out a character that, if flat, would have rendered the play emotionally meaningless. Skillfully evoking Medea’s sense of being trapped with nowhere to flee, Berrian allowed the audience to empathize with her even when she was contemplating the unthinkable. Two other strong performances were given by the Nurse (Misha C. Garrison-Desany ‘16), whose pathos-filled narration of the backstory started the play off strongly, and the Messenger (Rachel V. Byrd ‘13), who narrated the death of Creon’s daughter, giving the tragic scene the proper emotional weight it deserved.
By far the most problematic aspect of the production was that it didn’t have confidence in itself. At several points in the play, for example, Malete’s inability to carry his lines off with the necessary amount of conviction made them sound inadvertently humorous, and more than once, Berrian herself started laughing involuntarily when acting opposite him. If even the actors couldn’t believe each other, how was the audience supposed to?

Friends, this week the principles of idleness to which I adhere so faithfully have been somewhat shaken. Maybe it was the fact that my roommate sent me the following adage: “Only a busy person can truly enjoy leisure.” It wasn’t a passive-aggressive dig. I’m quite sure she has no clue about this column. Maybe it was the “no idling” sign that caught my eye as I was passing by Leverett yesterday. Whatever the cause, the outcome is that I have been rather less idle this week than I should have liked. And, surprisingly, I have been almost as happy doing many things as I have traditionally been doing nothing.
Often my yearning to do nothing stems more from a fear of work than an actual pleasure in idleness. In an effort to conquer this fear, I have tried to disguise my schoolwork as best I can. For Halloween, my thesis dressed up as a trip to the Museum of Fine Arts (and the Prudential Center for a spot of shopping). It was a great costume. It utterly fooled me into spending the afternoon after the museum visit working on my thesis. And I actually had fun. I actually wanted to be in the library. As a devout “idle-ist” I rarely set foot in Lamont because it fairly reeks of productivity. The harsh lighting, still air, and somewhat tense silence stifle all hope of doing no work. But yesterday the fluorescent bulbs seemed inviting, the absence of noise peaceful, the stillness calming.
I had gone to the MFA to see the recently installed ancient coin galleries, but I couldn’t resist the temptation to see the Mario Testino show currently on view. His artwork is the antithesis of ancient Greek coins: loud, garish, and giant. The only thing in common with the subject of my thesis, Greek coins, is a rather high frequency of nude men. But in much the same way that ancient coins were miniature portraits of rulers of the time, Testino’s photographs are giant portraits of modern day kings of culture. “Ah, yes,” I thought as I contemplated Kate Moss pouting in a tutu flanked by bearskin guards, “behold our era’s queen of glam.” “Ah yes,” I thought, as I gazed up at a nine-foot print of Gisele Bundchen stepping out of a limo in a shiny dress, “behold our era’s queen of sexy.”
Testino’s art is the idler’s delight. Walking through the galleries, I felt like one of the tiny characters in “The Borrowers” series, navigating the giant pages of Vogue. The pictures are enormous, glossy, colourful, and instantly recognisable. The subjects of the portraits are uniformly beautiful. The art is eye-candy in every sense of the word. Whether it is really art is another question entirely. Testino is first and foremost a fashion photographer, and the very act of showing his works in an exhibition begs questions about how fashion and art interact and overlap.
The more I can make my work resemble leisure, the more likely I am to do it, and the more enjoyable I find it. This has always been how I approach choosing classes, and it has traditionally worked very well. But there is a fine line between enjoyable academics and frivolity. In these instances of line crossing, the allegedly fun activity that is the purpose of the class becomes a chore in itself, utterly defeating the purpose of taking a gut class in the first place.
I assume not everyone is like me and has to beguile themselves into doing work, bribing themselves with museum visits and shopping trips and lord knows what else. But for me, this kind of bargaining with myself is not only fun, but ultimately fruitful. I did more work this weekend than I have in a while. Remind me to thank my roommate for sending me that quote.

I have spent many summer afternoons for longer than I care to remember playing Civilization with an old friend. What this means, mostly, is that we have killed tons of people; so many millions that I can sometimes hear them, wailing, from the depths of my hard-drive’s temporary files. Some perished in the nuclear catastrophe following the collapse of trade talks between Byzantium and Ethiopia, global superpowers. Others were martyred in Sumeria’s struggle for the global triumph of the proletariat. A lucky few survived to old age in isometric suburbia, where, in some save file or other, they live still. Others will join them, whenever we next get the time.
I am like many people of my generation: my sense of history is grounded in a patchwork of games. Books, documentaries—these are entitled to add some polish. But they will never change the facts. My Old West was settled by Oregon Trail’s eight-color Conestogas and their dysentery-ridden crews. My Rome—the Rome of Sierra’s Caesar III—was built in a day. And if the distant past often feels eerily present to me, it is perhaps because I have done substantial time temping as Pharaoh of Egypt, Doge of Venice, and Japanese Shogun.
Games engage with the past in a way that is viscerally different than any other medium of representation. This is because they allow for a certain freedom, for an element of play. The vast empathic distance between our own times and others may be shortened in the accounts of great writers, but only in games is this gap entirely bridged. This is not to say that historical games are superior representations—they are too systematic to have the vivacity of great writing—but only that they allow for a uniquely transparent, even transcendent point of view.
Who is the player in Civilization, or the Total War series of games? There are individuals—heroes, military and political leaders—but they come and go. The player remains somewhere above, unconstrained by the limits of knowledge, lifespan, and individual perspective. Not for nothing is the viewing angle of most historical simulations called the “God’s eye”: in most of them, the player is less any particular person and more a disembodied will behind the course of events. Only a game could arrive at this kind of person-less perfection—every other representation resolves to some kind of voice.
This is both the best and the worst attribute of the historical game. By allowing the player to impersonate the course of history, the world of the game begins to take on the imprint of the player’s will. Things can be changed—there is a certain thrill in leading the helicopters of mechanized infantry of Sitting Bull’s Native American Empire through the trembling cities of Europe, or in launching the world’s first extra-solar spacecraft from Tenochtitlan.
But large historical simulations are systematic and goal-driven, and because of this they often fall short of articulating true historical contingency. The qualitative differences between different peoples and ways of living are reduced to quantitative bonuses and penalties: Egypt is “Creative” and “Spiritual,” the United States “Philosophical” and “Industrious.” And, while it’s true that some things change from game to game—who wins, in what way, the physical shape of the world—others are hard-coded. The circumstances of Civilization’s development vary endlessly, but the way its technology tree unfolds is always the same.
Airplanes, radios, refrigerators, corporations, modern armies, and mass media are represented as historical inevitabilities, rather than particular historical developments occasioned by the ascendancy of particular groups and ways of thinking. No matter how the game goes, the soldiers end up in camouflage, the leaders in suits. No matter what the chain of events, the whole apparatus of real-world history is assumed. The play in the system is closely bounded. You are fated to end up where others found themselves by chance.
Fortunately, there are very few things in games that cannot be fixed by communities of players. And for each representational gap in the world of a game like Civilization, there is, somewhere out there, a modification. There are new civilizations, more detailed terrain, rules that better approximate the vast intricacies of global life. And in the final count, whatever is reductive or programmatic in the historical game is more than compensated for by these thousands of products of players’ imagination.

“Holy Motors” is a story about the separate lives of a crazed hitman, an accordion player, a dying man, and a father who are all actually the same man—a professional impersonator named Monsieur Oscar (Denis Lavant). The film is a collection of episodic shorts meshed together to form a relatively incongruent picture. Because of this scattered structure, at the end of the film, appreciating the aesthetic presentation is much easier than finding the defining thread of the plot.
Director Leos Carax’s first feature project in the last 10 years, “Holy Motors” follows nine business “appointments” of Monsieur Oscar from dusk until dawn. Oscar, escorted in a white limousine by his driver Celine (Edith Scob), has a vast variety of assignments in bustling Paris, some of which border on the supernatural. In each of these scenes, Oscar takes on the persona of a different individual. He plays a business professional, schizophrenic beggar, mob assassin, a loving father, and even a dying old man. In these subtle impersonations of the domestic and eccentric, the audience starts to get a sense of the bizarre job Oscar holds as a different character --although nothing is confirmed as to the reason for this playacting.
The film itself would be better described as a philosophical work of art rather than a plot-centered piece. “Holy Motors” is laudable and mesmerizing in its incorporation of stunning visuals with a sense of wackiness that forces the viewer to suspend reality in approaching Oscar’s story. One example of this off-kilter beauty is a slow-motion scene where Oscar plays a video-game green-screen actor having sex in a scene that merges a sci-fi feel with slow-capture nature films as the forms slowly melt into each other. The cinematography portrays Paris in a mystical manner through changing filters—most notably an interesting use of infrared where the colors eventually blends together so that no forms are distinguishable. The score reflects the mix-and-match filming style with ambient noises in unconventional places, such as the foghorn sound in someone’s bedroom that opens the movie. Both the director and the composer have the same vision of keeping the film unpredictable, which contributes to the mystic quality.
Lavant’s perfromance makes “Holy Motors” more than merely visually interesting. Taking on these various personas physically and emotionally, Lavant believably portrays such antithetical personalities. The businessman is cold and emotionless in his dealings. The beggar becomes a monster in his insanity, and his gibberish makes his crazed state terrifying. The father figure takes on such a relatable role that his interactions with his social outcast daughter serve as an emotional high point for the film.
Although the audience is drawn into the film strictly out of the cinematic beauty on display, one cannot help but wonder about where the plot figures in.  At one point, Oscar runs out of the limousine naked save for a barbed-wire ski mask, shoots a restaurant patron in the face, is shot at by mobsters, gets up, and returns to the limo—with Celine’s help—and drives off. He is completely fine in the next scene, and he actually gets shot a dozen times over the course of the film. Generally, the only connection between all of the scenes is the presence of Celine, who serves as the narrator for the story.
Despite little continuity between scenes and the fact that Carax never gives a reason for  how Oscar’s profession came to exist, much less his motivation, the film is still mesmerizing.  Counter-intuitively enough, in the absence of plot, the viewer can completely concentrate on the artistic stylings and what the film means as a whole. “Holy Motors,” after the foghorn opening, switches to a shot of a crowd in a movie theater watching fabricated life unfold in front of them on the screen.
As an audience to this film, life as we know it simply is an “assignment” for these impersonators. We have no idea what Carax intends with these episodes of life that seem as if they were taken from Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland,” but the apparent ideology of life as merely a performance with no meaning is well communicated.As an overall work, “Holy Motors” can be described as a “cinematic experience.” The psychadelic rendering of Paris is at times breathtaking and mostly redeems a film whose overall connectivity is ambiguous. Granted, there are many questions that Carax poses that remain frustratingly unanswered, but given the amount of time he obviously devotes to making the film mystical, it’s not from a lack of explanatory ability. Ultimately, “Holy Motors” is an adventure worth taking as it spotlights the beauty of cinematography, even though this honed focus can only be achieved because of the relative absence of plot.

For a clever, funny movie that makes skillful use of an 8-bit sentiment, see “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.” Disney seems to have sensed in “Scott” a winning formula for turning video game fans’ nostalgia into cash, as manifested in their newest film, “Wreck-It Ralph.” While the film has its share of funny moments and charm, a video-game aficionado would be hard-pressed to find an original idea, and from shameless product placement to a less-than-stellar script, “Wreck-It Ralph” has a shiny exterior but little substance.
Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) is an arcade game villain tired of Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) getting all the glory for repairing what Ralph smashes. When an AA-style support group for bad guys—featuring familiar faces like Bowser and Dr. Eggman, as well as, inexplicably, Satan—fails to dispel his feelings of resentment and inferiority, Ralph resolves to travel into another game and win a medal there to prove to himself and others that he too is a hero. He soon gets sidetracked by helping the glitchy reject Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) win in the candy-themed racing game called “Sugar Rush,” and like most Disney movies, the fate of their world somehow hangs in the balance.
Among the cast, including McBrayer was a good call: the movie’s humor is at its best with Felix, whose goofy innocent voice pairs well with lines like “That’s not blunt force trauma, ma’am, that’s just the honey glow in my cheeks.” Felix bears an uncanny resemblance to McBrayer’s better-known role as Kenneth from “30 Rock,” from his wholesome haircut to his Southern accent and religious bent—if I were Tina Fey, I might be a little ticked off. Calhoun is little more than a souped-up Sue Sylvester from “Glee.” Is this type-casting or merely laziness? Whatever it is, Disney hardly scores points for originality. The choice of Silverman was particularly mystifying, even though the intended audience hopefully isn’t familiar with her profane comedy style. Her character’s cutesiness was disturbingly incongruous with the other things that come out of her mouth during the film.
The movie does succeed in its animation. Disney’s pattern of having humanoid characters with disproportionate features can feel stale, but in “Ralph,” they switch things up with a throwback to the days of Gameboy Color, with curves that are rendered with pixel-sharp edges.  The movie is full of passing winks at video games, as when rifling through a lost-and-found box Ralph tosses aside a Super Mushroom. “Sugar Rush” has  candy cane trees, gumdrop stones, and chocolate rivers, rendered in luscious detail.
But even here, the sense of wonder at the artistry Disney’s animators have achieved is cut short by the fact that the movie is packed with product placement, which is neither subtle nor redeemed by irony. As the movie goes on, it starts to feel like you’re watching an advertisement for the refreshments stand in the theater lobby. There are two doughnuts named Winchell and Dunkin’, vines of Laffy Taffy hanging from tree branches, and to top it all off, a mountain called Diet Cola—as if the addition of the word “diet” would mask the fact that the ground is literally covered in sugar—that just happens to be in the shape of a vintage Coke bottle.
Script-wise, “Wreck-It Ralph” understandably caters mostly to little kids—with numerous puns on the word “doody”—but attempts at profundity to cater to adults fall flat. At one point, Felix notes, “A selfish man is like a mangy dog chasing a cautionary tale,” a line that was clearly intended to be a deep statement. Elsewhere in the movie, Ralph calls “Sugar Rush” a “candy-coated heart of darkness.” Somewhere in England, Conrad is turning in his grave.
No one walks into a Disney movie expecting the philosophical depth of Bergman or Godard. People go to laugh, to see pretty things, and to communicate a neat little moral lesson to their child. In that respect, “Wreck-It Ralph” is successful, as the message of “Anyone can be a hero” comes across clearly. But Disney’s classics possess something more than just that: they have an enduring power to provoke wonder and joy. “Wreck-It Ralph,” for all its 3D finery and star-studded cast, lacks this essential quality. What’s left is a movie that seems to assume that throwing enough money at something will somehow lead to quality. In that sense, the only thing that’s missing is a Romney 2012 sticker.

You have 48 hours before you’re going to lose your conscious mind and permanently retreat into a world constructed within your subconscious. How do you spend them? If you answered, “Eat Italian food, have sex, and listen to Bob Dylan,” pick up a copy of Haruki Murakami’s 1985 novel “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” and read it immediately. And then do some serious reassessing of your priorities.
The delightfully convoluted plot of “Wonderland” is tough describe in few words, but here’s the basic premise. The book consists of two narratives presented in alternating chapters. The first, “Hard-Boiled Wonderland,” is narrated by a solitary human data-encryptor—only referenced as “the Calcutec,” the name of this profession—who faces the aforementioned doomsday dilemma and recounts the events of his last conscious days. The other, “The End of the World,” is narrated by a newcomer to a dreamlike, utopian/dystopian city similar to the setting of Lois Lowry’s “The Giver.”  During the novel, it’s revealed that “The End of the World” is actually a version of the Calcutec’s subconscious, implanted into his mind by a rogue scientist.
If you’re confused, don’t worry, because I was baffled the first time I read “Wonderland.” I first picked it up in the midst of a yearlong Murakami binge and was immediately thrown by the book’s density in comparison to his other works. Murakami’s similarly ambitious novels “1Q84” and “The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle” feel downright straightforward and tidy compared to “Wonderland.” I finished the book with little idea of what had actually happened in its labyrinthine plot. So, later in the year, I read it again. This cleared up the plot somewhat, but the book’s meaning was still inscrutable to me. It wasn’t until reading “Wonderland” a third time this September that I determined it was an incredible and crazy book instead of just an incredibly crazy book. Having read most of Murakami’s novels and short stories, I’ve also come to view “Wonderland” as his best book—a killer combination of complex yet relatable characters, mind-bending philosophical themes, and slick, inventive writing.
At first, I didn’t find much to relate to with the Calcutec narrator of “Hard-Boiled Wonderland.” He’s divorced, alcoholic, and anti-social, likes to read Turgenev and Stendhal, and frequently says stuff like, “I don’t like to sleep with people I know. It only complicates things.” This kind of damaged, roguish character—a partially autobiographical depiction of Murakami himself—is ubiquitous throughout the author’s works. By the time I read “Wonderland,” I was well versed in and honestly bored of these mini-Murakamis.
However, this time around, the presence of “The End of the World” section shakes up the formula. The narrator of “The End of the World” is as close to a hero as Murakami has ever created—he’s generous, naïve, and adventurous. He’s also stuck in a walled city among mindless people for eternity, and, just like the Calcutec, is slowly having his mind taken from him.  He’s a character to root for. But here’s the catch: because “The End of the World” is a representation of the Calcutec’s subconscious, it’s as much a part of him as the conscious side shown in “Hard-Boiled Wonderland.”
However uninspiring the Calcutec is in his conscious life, he’s got a hero inside of him—and however heroic the narrator of “The End of the World” is, he’s the product of an uninspiring man. In “Wonderland,” Murakami asks some serious questions about identity and existence. Are the two narrators really the same person? Is life a physical phenomenon—that is, is someone alive if they only exist in a mental capacity like the Calcutec’s subconscious? I don’t know the answers, and if Murakami does, he’s not telling—he leaves most of questions unresolved, forcing the reader to ponder over them long after the book is closed.
However, while these questions are compelling, I’m really a philosopher second and a writer first, so I also love “Wonderland” for the same reason I love all of Murakami’s works—the language. It’s been said before due to the author’s former profession as a blues club owner, but Murakami’s writing is pure jazz. It constantly and spontaneously changes tempo and rhythm, soars off on tangents, and is littered with moments of brilliant invention.
Simply, in “Wonderland,” Murakami goes into Coltrane mode, removing his filter and letting the truly zany stuff flow. As a result, the book is brimming with incredible sentences, including two of my favorites: “Perhaps some fluctuation in the gravitational field had suddenly inundated the world with paperclips,” and “After thirty-six steps—I’m a habitual step counter—we were met by the sound of a loud slap, as if a huge cut of roast beef had been flung against a stone wall.”
You might be skeptical to pick up a 400-page book that I’ve already admitted took me three readings to fully appreciate, but I promise that the extra effort pays off. “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World” is a book well worth reading—and re-reading.

Cabaret
Nov. 9-11, 15-17, 7:30 p.m.,
Nov. 10-11, 2:30p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by Katherine L. Price ’14
Produced by David C. Manella ’14 and Alexandra M. Kiley  ‘15
The crew of “Cabaret” wants to ensure that the audience feels as if they are really in the “Kit Kat Klub,” the nightclub in Berlin where the musical is set. The Loeb Ex will be decorated to look like a jazz lounge; audience members will be seated around tables on three sides of the stage.  Within this immersive setting, the audience will witness the stories of Cliff (Jeremy Y.  Venook ’15), Sally (Maya M. Park ’16), Fraulein Schneider (Taylor K. Phillips ’15), and Schultz (Ari D. Brenner ’14) as they live life during Hitler’s rise in 1930s Germany.
Director Katherine L. Price ’14 says that the first act is strikingly different from the second in tone. “OBERON’s [production] was very dark, which is what I’m trying to stay away from,” Price says of the opening act. The dark moments later in the play are designed to highlight the similarities between “the Kit Kat Klub” and Nazi Germany as a whole.
“The cast [embodies] the wild energy of the Kit Kat Klub and respecting the very sinister political machinations that led to World War II,” says Sean K. Hardy ’16, who plays Victor. This shift in tone is in large part due to the drastic change between the first and second halves. “You don’t really see the ending coming, because it starts out being a fun time with sexy girls and romance and ends up being about the realities of politics,” says Margot K. Taylor ’16, who plays Fritzie. This fun but dark spin on the production—created by emphasizing Nazism and the harshness of the era—is a very important aspect for the crew.
The production aims to bring to the front the changing status of Jews in 1930s Germany. These particular ideas hold personal importance to many members of the cast and crew. “A lot of [‘Cabaret’s’] production team is Jewish, including me,” says Price. An example of the production’s emphasis on the deteriorating relationships between Jewish and non-Jewish Germans is a song that is sung by the Emcee (Alexander M. Willis ’14) while dancing with an actor dressed up in a gorilla suit. Using an absurd costume to represent perceived difference Willis sings, “If you could see her through my eyes / She wouldn’t look Jewish at all.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 11
An earlier version of this article referred to the character Fritzie, played by Margot K. Taylor ’16 in “Cabaret,” instead of Fraulein Schneider, played Taylor K. Phillips '15. It also stated that director Katherine L. Price ’14 aimed to make her production less dark than earlier renditions; in fact, Price stated that the first act of the musical is lighter than the second. Furthermore, the article incorrectly implied that an actor dressed up in a gorilla suit sings in the show, while in fact the song is a solo performed by the Emcee while dancing with the gorilla. The lyrics of that song were reported incorrectly.

El Misterio de Irma Vap
Nov. 8-10, 8:00 p.m.
Adams Pool Theater
Directed by Miriam E. Psychas ’13 Produced by Yucheng Pan ’15
The production of a Spanish translation of Charles Ludlam’s play “The Mystery of  Irma Vep”—rendered as “El Misterio de Irma Vap” in Spanish—is all vampires, ghosts and mummies. This show—produced by TEATRO!, a Harvard student group dedicated to bringing Spanish language theater productions to a wider audience—is a satire of moments that are commonly considered frightening: what has been designed to scare is transformed into a source of humor. And like most TEATRO! productions, “Irma Vap” will be entirely in Spanish.
“Irma Vap” seeks to be an immersive experience that includes more than just the the Spanish language. During the performance, the production makes use of aspects of Hispanic/Latino culture—such as a character playing a popular Brazilian song on the xylophone—all of which are aimed at creating a specific Latin American atmosphere for the show.
Although “El Misterio de Irma Vap” includes many characters in the script, this production only has two actors—Enzo V. Toral ’14 and Joao A. Vogel ’16. “I am so impressed by [the actors]. There are so many lines, so their total and utter concentration is crucial. They really never get a break,” says director Miriam E. Psychas ’13.
Sometimes the costume changes are even part of the play itself, as the actors are constantly switching roles.
This creative challenge is made even more difficult by the fact that both cast members have to play male and female characters. The cast sees this as a novel way of paying homage to Ludlam’s underrated importance in theater history. “Charles Lutman was one of the first playwrights to feature cross dressing on Broadway,” says Toral. “He was himself gay, and all his shows included cross dressing, but this was by far the most popular show.” The Spanish, the small cast, and the cross dressing all contribute to this unique production.

At the end of hall on the second floor of the Loeb Drama Center, where file drawers are replaced by cabinets whose labeled contents range from “bulky oversized sweaters” to “bras, girdles, and merry widows,” Jeanette Hawley makes customized clothing for people who don’t exist. As manager of the American Repertory Theater costume shop, she has recently oversaw the construction of wardrobes for the ill-fated, iconically coiffured French queen in David Adjmi’s “Marie Antoinette” and for the anthropomorphic male flowers fighting for love in Taylor Mac’s “The Lily’s Revenge.” Hawley compares her job in the studio, which is sunny and spacious despite stacks of fabric bolts and draft tables cluttered with papers and props, to that of a contractor who brings the designs of an architect—in this case the costume designer—into physical existence.
Though the costumes of these recent productions was visually spectacular and comparable in their complexity to works in high fashion, the designers’ intent was not purely to dazzle. The costumes for “Marie Antoinette,” designed by Gabriel Berry, and for “The Lily’s Revenge,” designed by Sarah Cubbage, were crafted to tell a story. Ideally, according to Hawley, costumes ideally support the story, the actors, and the production as whole. “The best costumes actually disappear. You’re so into the world of the play,” Hawley says, her own outfit a mélange of gray stripes which matches her short hair and small poodle-esque dog. This is no less true for costumes that on their own appear extravagantly spectacular, allowing the designer to illustrate the fantastical world of a play.
Each garment requires more than the stitches, fabric, buttons, and hours it takes to assemble it. Costume designers like Cubbage and Berry must delve into the characters’ psyches, immerse themselves in research of bygone eras and distant cultures, and maintain a constant dialogue with the director, actors, and rest of the production team. Costume design is an art form that seeks not to outshine the storytelling but accent it in order to serve the needs of the production as a whole. To create garments that simultaneously fit comfortably within the visual world of the play, on the body of the actors, and in the minds of the audience, costume designers must be attuned to both the context of the play and the context in which it will be watched.
ICE THE DRESS
Unlike their high-fashion counterparts, costume designers are not at full liberty to implement their personal artistic vision in their designs. “It seems less fun because it’s not just whatever the hell you want, but there’s a lot of freedom in discovering that you can tell these very cool stories very subtly and really support the work of a bunch of other people,” Cubbage says.
From the very beginning of their work on a show, the designer must make sure their designs align with the overall aesthetic vision of the production. Generally, according to Cubbage, between the scenic designer and costume designer, whoever has the strongest initial inspiration sets the overall look of a scene. This was the case in a the New Repertory Theatre’s production of “The Kite Runner.” For the production, costume designer Adrienne Carlile devised her costume design around the initial ideas of the scenic designer, Paul Tate dePoo III. “He very early started talking like ‘Ok, we’re going to make this very barren landscape,’” Carlile says. “So I’m going to pull my colors from that palette to really make it seem like these people are from this landscape.” The costumes jibed with the set except during key moments in the play in order to purposefully highlight shifts in action, including a change in setting from Afghanistan to San Francisco. Carlile, who also works as a scenic designer, believes that the mediums of scenic and costume design share an important visual language. “The idea of creating a stage picture that tells the story is the same,” she says.
Communication with lighting designers comes later in the technical process but is no less vital. The color of garments can be influenced, sometimes dramatically, by the light shown on them. Color can be changed at specific moments to enhance the feeling of the scene. Anna-Alisa Belous, the costume designer for a current production of “Macbeth” at the Actors’ Shakespeare Company, is aware of the potential of light to interact with her design. “To me it’s like icing the cake. A dress which was white one moment is blue the next,” she says. Costume design does not exist in vacuum. Designers not only must position their designs within the overall visual aesthetic of the production but also accurately grasp the story at the play’s heart in order to translate the character from the text to the stage.
BY ANY OTHER GOWN
Though costumes must follow the production’s vision, the primary responsibility for each costume is to convey certain characteristics of the individual character who wears it. Designers try to incorporate a character’s personality and psychology as well as lifestyle and social status in their wardrobe. Representing such characteristics can be particularly challenging when designing for fantastical, nonhuman characters like of “The Lily’s Revenge.” For the flower characters, Cubbage combined the physical nature and cultural connotations of the specific flower with the personality traits of each character. The character of Red Rose, for example, had the personality of an opera diva. “I’m going to look at images of opera divas, and I’m going to look at images of red roses. Then I’m going to start drawing them and then I come up with a shape on the page that feels like combination of the two,” Cubbage says. The final costumes were each carefully planned out to illustrate the wearer’s identity both as a flower and as a character.
Echoing how a method actor attempts to become his character, some costume designers research their characters’ circumstances in order to predict their wardrobe choices. “I try to understand a character enough to know what’s in their closet, so that depending on what’s going in a play I can help figure out what [they] should wear, what we should pull out of [their] closet,” says Mariann Verheyen, an associate professor of costume design at Boston University. In her current work for a production of David Lindsay-Abaire’s “Good People,” which is set in Boston, the regional proximity gives her an entry point into her characters’ psychology. “I can go walk around the neighborhoods this play is set in and smell the air that these characters are smelling,” Verheyen says. After contemplating the circumstances of her characters’ lifestyles, both psychological and financial, she can go shop at the very stores she envisions they would frequent and select clothes they would likely wear. It is an exercise in empathy as much as a journey of imagination.
For many shows, costumes are an important visual representation of characters’ differing social statuses. “In terms of saying someone is wealthy or not wealthy, totally destitute or dependent on someone else, you can say all that very clearly through clothing very quickly,” Carlile says. She found this to be especially true in a production of Neil Bell’s “Monster,” an adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, which is set in the 1820s. “It became very important to keep those clothing items very period-specific because we can’t capture that class system in modern dress,” she says. Conveying subtleties in social standing that would not be evident in today’s fashion, is necessary for understanding the characters’ relationships and motivations.
MARIE AND MCQUEEN
Historical accuracy in costume design can seamlessly accentuate the storytelling. Yet straying from historical accuracy can illuminate the more universal implications of the story. Since Adjmi’s “Marie Antoinette” relates the social inequality that sparked the French revolution to the current income inequality in America, Berry felt a purely historical approach to the costumes would have been misplaced. “The play has modern anachronisms sprinkled throughout. It was clear that it wasn’t going to be a slavishly ‘history of costume’ look at the story,” she says. So along with the fashion trends of the time period, Berry mixed in inspiration from modern fashion, particularly high-fashion designers like Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen, who have themselves tapped Antoinette’s era for inspiration.
Many designers seem to agree though that strict adherence to history is not only unnecessary but potentially distracting. Carlile references a recent review of “Cyrano de Bergerac” on Broadway on TheaterMania.com as part of a series called “Bros on Broadway.” In “A Guy Who’s Never Seen a Play in His Life Reviews Cyrano,” reviewer Josh Macin, described as a “jock, fraternity brother, World of Warcraft gamer,” wonders, “Did all women in the 1600’s wear their dresses backwards? Why is [Roxane’s] dress on backwards?”
While Macin’s mistake certainly betrays his cultural naïveté, Carlile feels it also points out a legitimate flaw in the costume design. “If you can’t tell if the dress is on correctly, I don’t care what period it is in, then it’s not right. You need to design costumes that can still be read and understood by audiences,” she says. Though plays should be evaluated in their historical context, costume designers must evaluate whether to sacrifice historical accuracy in order for the story to fully resonate with the audience.
Verheyen once designed for a Victorian play in which a female character disrobes. “I had her in the perfect Victorian corset. It was absolutely beautiful. She looked great and the scene seemed to be working, but the director kept saying ‘Mariann, something’s nagging at me about this…. I don’t think it’s sexy enough,’ and I was like, ‘You know what, I get that,’ and I changed it to a 1950s boned bustier,” she says. Though she admired the beauty of the historically accurate costume, it did not get the right message across. Verheyen frames the question as “What is more important: that it be period or that it be sexy the way we understand sexy?” She chose to stretch the historical veracity for the sake of the audience’s comprehension.
BOHÈMSTER
The role of the costume designer is not merely to update the setting of a play but to take it outside of time when necessary in order to serve the vision of the production. This freedom from the confines of accuracy can be liberating when other attributes of a production make adhering to historical facts difficult. For a production of “La Bohème” that Carlile designed, the problem was money. The opera is set in 1830s Paris, but the costume budget would not have allowed for full costumes from the period for each actor. “If we were to take all these lovely French people out of the 1830s and put them into contemporary America, what would they buy if they were shopping at thrift stores and flea markets and still trying to live this artistic ‘hipster life’? We could use contemporary clothing and still convey that timeless message of people who are really trying to live and die by their art,” Carlile says. She not only chose an anachronistic approach to make up for lack of funds, but to make the story more easily relatable for modern audiences. Her approach to the costume tapped into the universality of the characters’ lifestyle in “La Bohème.”
Cubbage is currently working on the designs for a production of “Peter Pan,” where she is also planning to depart from the costumes normally associated with the original story but for a very different reason. Cubbage wanted to find a way to portray the Native Americans without resorting racial stereotypes about Native American culture. She started by looking beyond their identity as Indians at what these characters signify in the story. “I think what they embody is this sense of wonder and coolness and badass-ness, so I decided to make them punks from the 70s,” Cubbage says. “They feel a little dangerous. They feel like the utmost in freedom and being cool that Peter looks up to, and they also feel like a tribal identity–if you were a punk, you’d dress a certain way.” Through this new identity the costumes will convey the culture and personalities of the characters without having to appeal to antiquated and potentially offensive cultural stereotypes.
For Carlile’s production of “The Kite Runner,” it was not a question of changing the cultural connotations of the costumes, but of universalizing the costumes. “Clearly we haven’t taken you to Afghanistan; we’re not sitting on an actual wall in Kabul. We can have that same journey of abstraction with the costumes,” Carlile says. “I started by dip dying and doing this ombre dye effect on all the costumes so that we would break their reality, even though all the silhouettes were the same and all the pieces were authentic and actually had been purchased from Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan.” The cultural distance between the environs of the production and the setting of the play is echoed in the design, similarly distancing the story from the specific circumstances of its setting to connect to a wider audience.
FIT IN
Costumes have to fit the actors’ idea of their own character in addition to the actors themselves. Costume designers must be careful to toe the line between over designing and leaving too much up to an actor. “Actors at some point want you to tell them what they are because you have some kind of an outside look at them, and then they tell you who they are because they’re already rehearsing the play,” says Belous. It is give and take, in which neither party should have too much power. Costume designers must be sure the clothing embodies the same characteristics that the actor feels their character possesses.
At the same time, Cubbage notes the risks in leaving too much up to the actors. “I’ve tried approaches where I’ve just asked the actors, ‘What do you think about what you’re wearing?” bring I some research images for what you’re wearing.’ Then you get a bunch of stuff and it makes your life so much harder,” she says. What is necessary for this balance is for a designer to make sure an actor trusts them and knows they are working for the same goal. The designs will enhance but not inhibit the actors’ ability to play their role and will not distract from their primary duty: to act. “I want them to feel good, and I want them to look good, and once an actor knows that that’s really what you want, then they trust you,” Cubbage says. “Because I really do embrace the character and think about the character from the inside out—I’m never just designing a pretty garment.”their role and will not distract from their primary duty: to act. “I want them to feel good, and I want them to look good, and once an actor knows that that’s really what you want, then they trust you,” Cubbage says. “Because I really do embrace the character and think about the character from the inside out—I’m never just designing a pretty garment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With three of the biggest names in 20th-century classical music on its October 28 program, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra filled Sanders Theatre with rich and subtle renditions of works that often challenge both orchestra and listener. Under the baton of Benjamin Zander, the orchestra showed an attentiveness to the modernists’ diverse demands, from the constantly wandering tonal center of Sergei Prokofiev’s “Violin Concerto No. 2” to the dissonant flutter-tongue horns in Richard Strauss’s “Don Quixote.” Yet, the program was often as mixed in its results as it was varied: tempo problems marred otherwise sensitive renditions, and a peculiar ordering of the program caused the concert to end in anticlimax.
The program opened with Jean Sibelius’s “Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island,” which showcased the orchestra’s dynamic and textural flexibility. The orchestra beautifully rendered the piece’s hushed and portentous introduction—the gossamer violin lines were tightly strung, while the distant and exposed horn calls suggested heroism but kept from announcing it outright. Even more remarkable was the orchestra’s ability to revisit this original mood of ambient anticipation throughout the piece, even after build upon build. The resulting volume variation was electrifying, even unnerving, and Sibelius’s piece glowed as a result.
Tempo problems attenuated some of this excitement. Throughout the middle of the piece, for example, the violins sung an expressive and melancholy theme while the horns provided a plodding waltz bass line. In the BPO’s rendition, these sections clashed—the horns rushed as the violins dragged—which detracted from the impression of the orchestra’s unity.
This lack of responsiveness to tempo persisted somewhat in the second piece of the program, Prokofiev’s “Violin Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, Op. 63,” although this hardly tarnished what was otherwise a brilliant performance of a challenging work. Guest soloist Stefan Jackiw performed the three-movement piece’s violin solo with mastery and maturity. The genius of his performance was in its general restraint, exemplified best by his performance of the unstable first movement. His initial statement of the theme, for instance, was deeply measured, with only an occasional hint of a glissando to match Prokofiev’s slippery tonality. Therefore, when the movement escalated, which it did suddenly and repeatedly, Jackiw’s violent stabs at the violin seemed completely deserved, as if his earlier moderation had earned our full emotional trust. His renderings of the second and third movements, the former saccharine and the latter Bacchanalian and decadent, were similarly varied and well paced. Jackiw’s profound emotional control culminated in a subtly dazzling performance.
The orchestra served as a fine complement to his virtuosic performance, following the involutions and sudden offshoots of Prokofiev’s tonality with poise. The dense chords of the subversively dissonant third movement, for instance, sounded especially clear despite their difficulty.
However, the orchestra’s performance faltered on the second movement, which, alongside Jackiw’s soaring vibrato, sounded emotionally flat. Based around a slow, gentle pizzicato waltz, this movement gains much of its energy from the abrupt introduction of a rapid minor section, which casts a lurking shadow under the main theme’s light simplicity. In the BPO’s performance, the rapid sections were taken at too slow of a tempo, which stripped the movement of this jarring contrast. Fortunately, in the context of an absorbing performance that generally made Prokofiev’s treacherous tonal leaps with success, this lack of nuance did little harm.
After the spirited and varied performance of Prokofiev’s piece, which drew a standing ovation from the audience, Strauss’s “Don Quixote” sounded undeniably anticlimactic. This piece, which is based around scenes from Cervantes’s novel, consists of a theme, ten variations, and a finale, a structure which inherently lacks the intense dramaturgy of a tight, three-movement work like Prokofiev’s. Similarly, Rafael Popper-Keizer’s cello solo, though technically adept, lacked the spirit and dynamism of Jackiw’s, to the extent that it often blended in with the orchestra behind it. Even the conclusion lacked drama: Strauss’s piece ends with a light authentic cadence, eschewing the satisfaction of a grand finale. The resulting feeling of anticlimax could have been avoided had the program concluded with the Prokofiev or another piece with as much energy.
Anticlimax, though, indicates that the power of the program’s first two pieces built up expectations for the third. The BPO showed an impressive control and emotional variety in these first two works, and the relative monotony of the third should not overshadow that dynamism.

Tariq Teguia recalls ending the last paper he wrote as a student with the words, “I want to make films.” In subsequent years, Teguia worked as a photographer and a teacher, but by the mid-’90s, he had found his way to directing. His first two feature films, 2006’s “Rome Rather Than You” and 2008’s “Inland,” have both garnered significant acclaim, the latter receiving awards and nominations at international film festivals. Both films focus on Teguia’s native Algeria. His third film, which is currently in the works, concerns Africa as well as the Middle East.
Teguia speaks French (the interview was conducted with a translator) and is the recipient of the 2012 McMillan-Stewart Fellowship in Distinguished Filmmaking, which Harvard’s Film Study Center awards yearly to a Francophone filmmaker hailing from Africa or of African descent. (Teguia’s films are not in French, however, but in Arabic.) On October 26 and 27, Teguia’s films were screened at the Harvard Film Archive.
The Harvard Crimson: You studied philosophy and visual art in Paris. How did your time in France influence your style of filmmaking?
Tariq Teguia: France is really the place where the theorizing of cinema began. Why I went to France was because of that theorizing of cinema.... But when it comes to films, it’s really a matter of undoing yourself or unmaking yourself. I studied film theory; I didn’t study filmmaking. So when it comes to [actual filmmaking], you have to forget yourself, forget what came before.
THC: You have made both feature-length films and short films. How does your process change when directing one as opposed to the other?
TT: Ultimately, very little. I work with a small crew, and we work with very little means. But we work with a lot of energy and desire, and I try to keep that sense of economy in all my films. And I’m working with people who are not really a part of the film industry, but who are friends, above all.
THC: Both your feature films address issues facing contemporary Algeria. Do you think Algeria will remain the focal point of your films?
TT: It’s true I’ve only made films about Algeria so far, but “Inland” is plugged into spaces beyond Algeria. It’s time for me to plug Algeria into larger networks...plugging Algeria into Africa as a whole, Africa as a continent. Now in the new film I’m enlarging the map, plugging Algeria into new places, into the Mediterranean, into Europe. But Algeria is always there. As to whether I’d make a film without Algeria at all? I don’t know about that. Maybe a Western; maybe I’ll make a Western here.
THC: What do you think are some of the central problems facing Algeria?
TT: Algeria’s problems are problems of underdevelopment, problems of the electoral process, the democratic process—basically, the problems that any country might be facing 50 years after independence. Every single colonized country has faced these problems.
THC: Are any of your projects rooted in real life experience?
TT: Yes, they come from experience before filming, experience before writing. In fact, it’s experience, then writing, then experience again, and then filming.
THC: In your opinion, what are the most integral differences between Francophone films and American films, Francophone directors and American directors?
TT: I am a Francophone director, but my films are not in French. If you were to think of the differences between American filmmakers and European filmmakers, there are many differences, but one that comes to mind is space. American filmmakers really draw from that large sense of geographical space. European filmmakers work with history, [Americans] work with space. And I’m working with both, because I’m making a film about the ghosts that haunt history.

In her recent essay “Valuing the Creative and Reflective,” written for the benefit of Harvard’s admissions committee, A. Kingsley Porter University Professor Helen Vendler urges Harvard to reevaluate its admissions methodology.
The distinguished professor of English argues that the admissions standards familiar to today’s Harvard students—near-perfect GPAs and test scores, extracurricular leadership, public service and general geniality—privilege well-rounded, quantifiably accomplished candidates at the risk of passing over creative genius.
“The critical question for Harvard is not whether we are admitting a large number of future doctors and scientists and lawyers and businessmen (even future philanthropists): we are,” Professor Vendler writes. “The question is whether we can attract as many as possible of the future Emersons and Dickinsons.”
The question, in short: would Ralph Waldo Emerson, class of 1821, have been admitted to the Harvard class of 2016? Were he admitted, would he have wanted to come?
Harvard ought to ask these questions—ought to ask how it can attract the best and most creative students, not merely the busiest and most ambitious. Professor Vendler grounds this conclusion in a persuasive argument for the primacy of creative minds in defining the reputations not just of universities, but even of nations—we are remembered more for our artists than for our conventionally successful types.
The question that interests me, though, has less to do with what will make Harvard better, and more to do with what will make Harvard’s current student body better.
Professor Vendler quotes a line from John Ashbery ’49, “I tried each thing, only some were immortal and free,” and then identifies “immortal and free things” with “art and thought,” attaching particular metaphysical value to the work of artists and art-lovers. Used in this way, however, Ashbery’s line loses some of its suggestiveness. But if we call to mind some of the poetic work the line itself recalls, we see how much it could mean not just for arguments over the value of disciplines, but for anyone at all.
In his 1855 Preface to “Leaves of Grass,” Walt Whitman encourages the reader, “re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your soul.” This sentiment of Whitman’s is, I think, very close to Ashbery’s. There are things, both poets remind us, that are immortal and free, that are worthy of the soul; all else, though we may well try it, should at last be set aside.
Professor Vendler’s use of Ashbery’s line suggests that what must be cast aside is what is not artistic and reflective. This may well be what Ashbery means, but what Ashbery’s line called to my mind, by way of Walt Whitman among others (Wendell Berry’s “Manifesto” especially), was a more basic, vital kind of freedom, the freedom Whitman speaks of when he promises that whoever dismisses all that insults his soul will make of his own flesh “a great poem” with “the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face.”
This is a difficult freedom to define, but I think we tend to know it when we feel it. As a student of English literature I like to believe in the importance of the arts, but as a student of Harvard I am obliged to admit that I have seen immortality and freedom in the faces of all sorts of students, from aspiring artists to promising financiers, and I have seen an enslavement to the most mundane and mortal of our worries in the faces of the most and least “creative” alike. And then I have seen both of these in my own face, from time to time.
Suppose we set the future aside. Suppose we ask not how to get the next Emerson to Harvard, but how to make the people Harvard already has into the kind of people Professor Vendler imagines Emerson as being, people immortal and free. What would that look like?
I don’t have any answer to this question. Professor Vendler suggests we “mute our praise for achievement and leadership” and “pronounce equal praise for inner happiness, reflectiveness, and creativity,” and I think that would certainly help. Between recent tragedies and Divinity School Professor Jonathan L. Walton’s reflection on the importance of mental health care, we have been reminded lately that none of the many kinds of success we pursue should come at the expense of our inward happiness, our capacity to rest in ourselves and in others.
Whatever the way may be to that kind of happiness and the freedom that follows it, I find myself wondering what we might be capable of if we weren’t always trying so hard. If only we took the time to look, I wonder what Emersons we might find among us, what poems we might read already etched in our own faces.

Sabrina Lastman’s fascination with the Uruguayan poet Idea Vilariño was born of an encounter with Vilariño several years ago in Montevideo, where, Lastman said, she found the poet to have a silent, solitary strength. “That [silence] was the first thing that came to mind. It had to do with her own world, a lot of silence for writing, teaching, and researching. She was a very lonely person, so silence was a big mark of her world,” Lastman said.
Lastman, a vocalist, performer, and composer, has been traveling the country for the past four years performing “Dialogues of Silence,” her interdisciplinary musical and theatrical piece meant to convey the passion and vision of Vilariño’s works to a greater public. She will deliver the performance, presented through the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, tomorrow in CGIS South’s Tsai Auditorium.
Taking six Vilariño poems on love and loss as her inspiration for dance and musical performance, Lastman hopes to create a dialogue with the past, she said. The dialogue element of the piece came to her out of the intimacy of Vilariño’s verses. “She is connecting with people because of her poetry—from that silence, that life so inside her world, that creativity, she connected so much with people,” Lastman said.
Lastman’s performance is another dialogue of sorts—an interdisciplinary one, weaving together dance movements, voice, visuals and instrumentals to project Vilariño’s poetry and vision. “I’m bringing another layer—that is, sound outside of poetry,” Lastman said. In addition to fusing her multicultural dance and voice experience, Lastman combines improvisation with scripted, composed material and uses video artist Shige Moriya’s videos and images as a visual accompaniment.
The performance’s emphasis on dialogue figures well into the DRCLAS’ initiative through which it will be presented. Called ARTS@DRCLAS, the initiative is intended to introduce more Latin American art to the Harvard community and inject a greater two-sided dialogue with the continent. “We want to incorporate visual arts, performance arts, spoken word,” ARTS@DRCLAS Program Manager Marcela V. Ramos said. “By bringing this performance to the students and the faculty, we’re fostering [a Latin American]  presence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am not a vegetarian and I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with eating meat. Despite this, I have recently urged the Harvard University Dining Services to join with the international Meat Free Monday movement and go vegetarian for just one meal a week. In the process, I seem to have riled some of Harvard’s most committed “Meatarians”—and the bureaucracy that caters to their meaty needs.
 
Earlier this month, Casi S. Karunaratne ’15 made an elegant case for reducing the amount of meat we consume. Indeed, eating less meat is important for the environment. According to a 2006 UN report, the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector account for around 18 percent of the global total—more than the transport sector. Climate change aside, raising livestock for human consumption comes with a series of local environmental impacts, especially in terms of water depletion and pollution. NPR produced an infographic detailing what goes into your quarter pounder, including over 6 pounds of grain, 50 gallons of water, 70 square feet of land for grazing and feed crops, and 1000 Btu of fossil fuel energy.
 
What does Harvard think about all of this? Not much, apparently. Despite being a self-professed leader in sustainability, HUDS apparently does not want to join more than 100 other schools across the world choosing to go meatless for one day each week. As was bluntly stated by the manager of the graduate dining hall, “we cannot and will not go meat free for any dinner service.” End of story.
 
If nothing else, the Meat Free Monday campaign serves as an interesting case study of institutional inertia. HUDS finally condescended to let the issue be put to a vote among graduate students. At first, they wanted a “unanimous” vote in favor of the proposal, then eventually agreed enough to lower the threshold of support to 95 percent of voters before they would consider going meatless. HUDS did not allow student input into the voting survey or provide students with information about the reasons for going meatless.
 
Eventually, 212 students—close to 70 percent of voters—voted in favor of the proposal. HUDS even received a personal letter from Sir Paul McCartney.  Why does HUDS continue to be so resistant to change?
 
It turns out they are scared of the Meatarians.
 
That’s right, Meatarians. Marching under the noble banner of Personal Liberties, this selfless vanguard of carnivorous crusaders is fighting hard to protect our inalienable right to eat as much meat as we want whenever we want—whatever the cost to the environment. For example, one student commented on the survey that voting to ban meat is the sort of dangerous logic that leads societies to “ban unpopular books, restrict free speech, and attack civil liberties.” And it is these Meatarians of whom HUDS is afraid. As one representative from HUDS wrote to me, “if we have even a few people who feel strongly about having meat available, we need to meet their needs.”
 
Understandably, HUDS doesn’t want a bunch of angry customers on their hands. The dining halls provide two to three meat options and fewer vegetarian options at each meal, catering to the many students who like and want to eat meat. But going without for just one meal a week isn’t a big hardship. It can, however, make a big difference. A report from the University of Chicago suggests that that switching to a plant based diet could do more to cut emissions than switching from an SUV to a high-efficiency vehicle.
 
Ideally, we would incentivize people to eat meat of their own accord, but that’s hard to do on a meal-plan without being able to control pricing. However, take meat off the menu and people might realize they can actually live without it.
 
Furthermore, we limit personal freedoms all the time in order to promote the public good.  I’m all for individual liberties—up until the point where they begin to encroach on collective freedoms. For instance, I don’t believe that my personal freedom to buy a massive gas-guzzling SUV trumps the arguably greater freedom we all have to live in a world with clean air and a stable climate. In this analogy—clumsy as it is— Meat Free Monday would be something like Fuel Economy Standards, which almost everyone apart from auto-industry lobbyists accepts as a reasonable limit on our personal freedom.
 
Ultimately, Meat Free Monday is about a small change that can make a big difference. HUDS caters to a vocal minority of Meatarians who either refuse to see the wider environmental merits of reducing consumption for just one meal a week or simply don’t care. This article is dedicated to the less-meat majority. We are the 70 percent!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We Americans love to brag about the strength of our democracy, but a surprising number of us do not actually participate in the democratic system.  Some citizens have legitimate reasons for not getting to the polls, but with the easy availability of absentee ballots and early voting, many eligible voters don’t cast their ballot simply because they cannot be bothered.  Voting should be seen as a personal obligation for all citizens. Indeed, higher voter turnout rates would result in a political process that would be more effective and appeal to more Americans.
In a short New York Times Op-Doc, filmmaker Errol Morris interviewed young voters asking why they chose (or chose not) to vote.  One said that his grandmother, who was black, could not vote until she was 43, so he would vote to honor her legacy.  Another said that voting was a cheap thrill.  Another said, “part of being young means that we still believe we can change the world,” so we should vote to do our part.
These reasons are all perfectly reasonable, perhaps even admirable, but they are all fundamentally self-centered.  I think that this points toward a greater, troublesome trend in American politics: young people think that they only need to be politically engaged to the extent that they will personally benefit from their own engagement.  There is little talk about civic responsibility, and this is not just a problem for the “me” generation.
The obvious effect of our self-centered approach to politics is our abysmal voter turnout rate. 200 million Americans are eligible to vote, but only half of them will cast a ballot in presidential election years. We trail all of Western Europe in this regard.
Low turnout rates have a real and negative effect on American politics.  Knowing that many Americans will not get to the polls, campaigns spend most of their time and money trying to energize their party base. This has the effect of pushing candidates away from the political center and towards their party’s ideological extreme.
Campaign strategists know that the deciding votes will not be cast by moderate independents, but by those on the ideological fringe, whose decision to go to the polls will boost a candidate’s vote count.  This thinking seems to play a large role in the barrage of slanderous advertising and negative tactics seen in recent campaigns.  Flagrant negativity in campaigning often means that those who do vote for a candidate do so out of disgust for his or her opponent, rather than a feeling that he or she will govern well.
There is a small group that that benefits from this increased polarization: those in the radical wing of the party that wins an election. Their candidate becomes more partisan during the election and eventually takes office.  For the majority of Americans, however, political polarization has a negative effect. Moderation tends to help everyone, and our current system discourages that practice.
If so many people would benefit from increased voter participation, why do we continue to see such pathetic turnout at the polls?  To find an answer, we return to the self-centered nature of our political involvement.
Each individual vote will not do very much to increase voter turnout.  Assuming approximately 100 million voting Americans, each individual vote will only increase voter turnout percentage at the 8th decimal place—not much of a difference.  For people who want to change the world, casting one vote is not going to do the trick.  I cannot imagine it being much of a “thrill” to know that I have increased voter turnout by 0.00000001 percent.
The low turnout, then, is essentially an example of the tragedy of the commons.  While we all would benefit from a world in which everyone cast a ballot, our own individual actions do not do very much to further that goal.  In contrast, we judge that there is a high personal cost to voting in terms of the inconvenience of getting to the polls or mailing an absentee ballot.  We value our time highly, and want to spend it doing things that make more than a 0.00000001 percent change.
A sense of personal obligation to vote would both increase turnout and benefit most Americans, but it is unlikely that such an obligation can be instilled in the voting populace anytime soon.  The closest thing that most of us come to a sense of obligation is the somewhat common sentiment that “if you don’t vote, you can’t complain.”  By this logic, we are obligated to vote because voting earns us the right to whine for the next four years. This is hardly a commendable line of reasoning.
The New York Times’ documentary featured one voter who said that he voted because, “it’s not about you; it’s about all of us.”  Unfortunately, this sentiment is scarce in today’s political climate.  If more people took the view that voting should not be done out of self-serving motivations, but rather from an obligation as an American citizen, we would start to see a more effective, moderate, and civil political system. That would benefit everyone.

Today’s the big day! Citizens will participate in our greatest civic duty—and be accessories to the most excessive and expensive campaigns in history. So here’s my prediction for the evening: a loss for the common man.
American politics is perpetually caught in a catch-22 between irrelevance and inefficacy. More than 50 years ago in the novel “Catch-22,” Joseph Heller presciently painted the saga of war-profiteering Milo Minderbinder, whose caricature of the American dream and crony capitalism now seems disturbingly nonfictional.
At first, the soldiers of Pianosa tolerate Milo’s scheming syndicate as he manipulates his connections with government officials, hands massaged with miniscule shares, to amass a fortune. But the allure of money corrupts Milo’s morals: He markets morphine, leaving soldiers to die in excruciating pain, and accepts a German bribe to bomb his own base.
Milo’s syndicate is the perfect allegory for the stranglehold the current regime of uncontrolled independent expenditures has taken on the political process in this post-Citizens United era. An insidious torrent of unlimited, anonymous campaign contributions has been tolerated. As long as our government is not of the people, by the people, but for special interests, it will continue to distort political responsiveness and corrupt our institutions.
This election season will have an estimated total cost of $6 billion and has seen independent expenditures on House and Senate races explode tenfold from the previous election’s total of $46 million to an estimated $445 million. The political operatives managing the super PACs and shadowy “nonprofits” are missionaries from the same cult of Milo, peddling an unholy trinity of equations: money is speech, corporations are people, and bribery is merely corruption.
Money is not speech. Speech is speech. The corrupting cascade of money emptied into campaign coffers this election season does not come from some altruistic desire for an elevation of political rhetoric—these massive, secret contributions actually fund deliberate and disingenuous misinformation campaigns, like the intentional misquoting of President Obama’s “you didn’t build that” line or unfair Democratic attacks on Bain Capital.
Blind adherence to a fallacious money-speech equivalence is myopic. Corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to maximize profits through any legal means possible—and purchasing our government has proven massively lucrative. Consider the $282 million spent lobbying for the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act, which eventually saved corporations a total of $88.6 billion in taxes: a 22,000 percent (yes, three zeroes) return. Money pads the pockets of politicians’ reelection campaigns, addicts our representatives and senators, and corrupts regulation by building revolving doors in ways that true speech simply does not.
Just as money is not speech, corporations and unions are not people. People are people. After all, the preamble to the Constitution stated that it is written by and for “We the People” not “We the Multinational Corporation.” Corporations and unions are legal constructs created by us that oscillate freely in and out of existence with no desire for life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. Corporations may not be immoral, but they are certainly amoral. It makes little sense to equate, in the eyes of the Constitution, an amoral, profit-maximizing institution with a sentient human being. Even the conservative former Supreme Court Justice William H. Rehnquist has cautioned that to “ascribe to such artificial entities an ‘intellect’ or ‘mind’ [for constitutional purposes] is to confuse metaphor with reality.”
Legalized bribery is not mere corruption. Bribery is bribery. The large donors whose dollars crowd out the voices of the electorate rationalize this bribery masquerading as free speech by asserting that there are no quid pro quo exchanges in campaign donations. But this convenient defense is premised on a naïve conception of infallible human nature. Our politicians are still beholden to the people paying for their careers, regardless of whether they are gifted a million dollars worth of ads or a million-dollar yacht. These payments are made with the expectation of future rewards.
The transaction is essentially a legalized bribe, despite elaborate legal contortions that suggest otherwise. Large donors and corporate lobbyists commit huge sums of money to influence, water down, or even kill unwanted legislation and promote a weak governance that distorts the will of the electorate, as evidenced by attacks on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the persistence of needless subsidies to oil companies.
"In a democracy, the government is the people," Milo explains later in “Catch-22.” "We're people, aren't we? So we might just as well keep the money and eliminate the middleman.”
Regardless of whom America elects today, that sure seems like the road we’re headed on.

The wise words of the sage Ice T are applicable to many situations, but are particularly relevant to Harvard Law School. Between 2003 and 2006, only 9.8 to 12.1 percent of HLS’ graduating classes went to work for a nonprofit organization or the government. Despite significant student interest in public sector jobs, students at HLS often feel pressurized to seek jobs in the private sector due to the Law School’s interview programs. We lament that corporate law firms have an undue draw of HLS students given that this is not the result of diminutive student interest in pursuing careers in other sectors.
Several factors contribute overall to the flight of HLS students to the private sector. First year salaries at private sector law firms can be as high as $160,000, more than twice as much as the $65,000 earned by attorneys with 11-15 years of experience working in the public sector. This huge difference in financial gain is especially pertinent given the rising costs of education, with students borrowing $100,000 on average to attend private law schools. Employment within the public sector is also uncertain in the wake of the recession, with both non-profit and government sectors having implemented widespread freezes and layoffs. Firms from the private sector also recruit very aggressively, with 11,000 interviews exclusively for private sector jobs held in five days during Harvard Law School’s Early Interview Program. Rather than allowing students to be siphoned off all too easily by an aggressive campus recruiting program undertaken by law firms, HLS should take it upon itself to work harder to help students find public sector jobs.
Harvard Law School has already made an effort to encourage students to pursue a career that is aligned with their interests in the public sector by founding the Holmes Public Service Fellowships and the Redstone Fellowships, in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow has also personally undertaken the creation of both a new program of study called “Law and Social Change” and the Public Service Venture Fund. HLS also announced that it would waive tuition for third-year students who pledge to spend five years working either for nonprofit organizations or the government in 2008.
These efforts to address the financial burden of high tuition costs are admirable, but this simply is not enough. HLS needs to use its connections to help set up interview programs for public sector organizations akin to its efforts to facilitate student interviews for private companies. The public sector has a lot of potential for recently graduated law students. Law school students who graduated in 2010 earned $84,111 on average during their first year, a 10 percent decrease from 2009. At a time when good private sector jobs are becoming steadily more and more competitive, the newly expanding public sector could provide relief for recent graduates.
It is unfortunate that students feel the need to seek jobs in the private sector due to informal institutional barriers or pressure at any school. Nonetheless, we look forward to the Law School continuing to make it easier for HLS students to pursue the career they are truly passionate about. In particular, by strengthening the role of non-profit organizations in on-campus recruiting, HLS will surely continue to foster a growing interest in public sector jobs.

With more than a year of campaigning behind her and millions of dollars raised and spent, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren arrives at Election Day the cautious front-runner in Massachusetts’ hotly contested U.S. Senate race.
Pointing to Warren’s mounting momentum and her campaign’s superior ground game, Democratic and Republican political strategists said the race is Warren’s to lose as popular incumbent U.S. Senator Scott Brown runs out of time to change voters’ minds.
“Elizabeth Warren goes into Tuesday having been in the lead or tied in virtually every public poll with the exception of one or two [in recent weeks],” Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh said, calling Warren the “prohibitive favorite.”
“I think Brown supporters are just as enthusiastic as Warren supporters, but she has the advantage of the party and union machinery, giving her an organizational edge,” said Republican strategist Todd Domke of Brown’s chances.
Warren has built on that advantage with an impressive grassroots organization of her own. Warren’s press secretary Alethea Harney said campaign volunteers knocked on over 200,000 doors last weekend and made 600,000 phone calls. Harney said she expects 20,000 Warren volunteers will be deployed Tuesday to get voters to the polls.
Brown’s own “get out the vote” effort is expected to be the most extensive ever put in place by a Massachusetts Republican, Massachusetts Republican Party spokesperson Tim Buckley told The Springfield Republican.
Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin predicted that between 3.1 and 3.2 million voters will go to the polls statewide. If achieved, that total would be the highest in state history, and likely give Warren enough of an advantage to secure victory in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans three-to-one, Marsh said.
Brown, who was swept into office on a wave of Tea Party energy two years ago, has not been able to replicate the excitement and support his candidacy generated in the 2010 special election, Domke said. In a state as blue as Massachusetts, Republicans are rarely re-elected to statewide office.
“What’s needed is not just for the Republican to be popular and run a good campaign, but what he needs is a weak Democratic opponent who runs a weak campaign,” Domke said. “And Warren has been a strong opponent, and they’ve run a good campaign.”
Brown’s vote tallies will also likely be hurt by Democratic President Barack Obama’s popularity. Assuming Obama wins Massachusetts by 20 points or more, Brown will have to win over a significant number of those Obama supporters, Republican strategist Rob Gray said.
“To win he’s got to get certainly above 60 percent of unenrolled voters—probably above 62 percent—and he’s got to get one in five Democrats voting for him or better,” Gray said.
Brown’s best chance may be Massachusetts voters’ hesitance to elect women to statewide office, Marsh said.
“Most Democrats would be walking away with this, but the fact is...Massachusetts simply does not elect women to higher office,” Marsh said. If elected, Warren would become the first female U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.
Regardless of who comes out ahead, Marsh and others said they expect the margin to be close.
Early on in the race, polls indicated that Warren and Brown were neck-and-neck. Warren’s candidacy appeared to be floundering in early September, but analysts said Warren’s strong debate performances in September and October, coupled with key endorsements and improved advertising, pushed Warren into the lead.

Aside from two high-profile races at the top of the ballot and a pair of controversial initiatives, Cambridge residents stepping into the voting booth in and around Harvard Square today are not likely to find much in the way of a contest.
Most positions up for grabs today are either uncontested or uncompetitive, with the exception of the presidency and the Massachusetts’s junior U.S. Senate seat.
In contested races, Democratic incumbents are expected to win in a landslide.
At the top of the ballot, President Barack Obama is expected to easily out-poll former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in his home state, picking up Massachusetts’ 11 electoral votes. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill E. Stein ’72, a two-time Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate, will likely take some support away from the Democratic and Republican front-runners.
In Massachusetts’ much-watched U.S. Senate race, voters will choose between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor and Cantabrigian Elizabeth Warren.
Also likely to draw voters’ attention are Questions Two and Three, for which affirmative answers would allow doctors to prescribe life-ending medicine and legalize medical marijuana respectively.
Both questions have attracted a lot of attention and drawn much scrutiny.
The two controversial measures will be accompanied by two more benign initiatives.
Question One, the “Right to Repair,” would give car owners access, starting in 2015, to diagnostic and repair information previously unavailable to them.
Question Four is a non-binding show of support for the so-called “Budget For All,” which would urge legislators in the Middlesex and Suffolk Districts to prevent cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs, while promoting job growth and raising taxes on the wealthy.
The Fifth Congressional District race between longtime Democratic Congressman Edward J. Markey and Republican Tom Tierney, a consulting actuary and perennial candidate, is expected to be a landslide in favor of the incumbent.
The new Fifth District is the result of redistricting earlier this year which reassigned parts of Cambridge formerly represented by Congressman Michael E. Capuano, including much of Harvard’s campus, to Markey.
The only other contested seat on the ballot is Middlesex County Sheriff. Current sheriff, Peter J. Koutoujian, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Ernesto M. Petrone, a politically unenrolled corrections officer with the county.
The other five posts up for grabs on the ballot are uncontested. These posts include the Middlesex & Suffolk state senate district and the Twenty-Fifth Middlesex District for state legislature. After winning her Democratic primary handily in September, Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker will assume Cambridge’s state legislature seat today. Democratic State Senator Sal N. DiDomenico was unopposed in his own primary and will retain his seat for another two years.
Also running uncontested, Democrat Terrence W. Kennedy will be re-elected to the Governor’s Council, Democrat Michael A. Sullivan will be re-elected Clerk of Courts for Middlesex County, and Democrat Maria C. Curtatone will be re-elected Register of Deeds for Middlesex County’s southern district. Local polls open at 7 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m.

UPDATED: Nov. 8, 2012, at 1:56 a.m.
In what observers surmised was an initiation task for a female final club, two young women wearing the Sablière Society’s signature blue scarves grabbed a newspaper from a vendor of homeless paper Spare Change News and then videotaped themselves on an iPhone trying to sell the paper, according to Harvard Square Homeless Shelter staff members who saw the incident.
The stunt, which occurred as punch season for initiates in Harvard’s final clubs is drawing to a close, sparked indignant comments among the shelter’s all-student staff.
Dressed in superhero costumes, the two punches took a newspaper from Gregory H. Daugherty, a regular vendor of Spare Change News, which homeless men and women can buy for a quarter and then sell for a dollar in Cambridge and Boston.
Daugherty has been a presence in Harvard Square for about two decades, known for using friendly greetings like “Hello, young lady” and “Hello, young man” to sell the paper outside of Au Bon Pain on Mass. Ave.
Jenna R. Overton ’14, a supervisor at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, sent an email over the shelter board’s email list following the incident expressing dismay at what she perceived to be the women’s exploitation of Daugherty.
“It seemed like the girls were mocking the man,” Overton said in an interview with The Crimson. “It seemed inappropriate and rubbed me the wrong way.”
Overton said that Daugherty did not appear angry, but he also did not participate in the video.
“He is always gregarious and friendly, but when one of the girls pulled out the camera, the man backed off as though to say, ‘I’m gonna let you do your own thing,’” said Overton, who is also an inactive Crimson arts editor.
Members of the Sablière Society declined to comment. The club’s punchmasters were also unavailable for comment.
In response to Overton’s email, other members of the shelter staff expressed their indignation over the initiation task.
Though co-administrative director Kelly A. Sullivan ’14 declined to comment specifically on the incident because she was not a witness, she said the shelter has housed individuals who have experienced abuse or discrimination as a result of their housing status.
“We at Harvard Square Homeless Shelter really want to stress the importance of the dignity of homeless people we encounter,” Sullivan said.
Thursday’s incident was not the first time a final club punch task has involved homeless people from Harvard Square, according to Overton. She said that a friend punching a male final club last year was ordered to dress up and pretend to be homeless, panhandle in the Square for $5, and then take a picture with a homeless person.
Overton said she could not speak to the intentions of those who designed the task and said that the women may not have foreseen how the task would appear.
“But watching it as a passerby, the act seemed inappropriate and inherently demeaning to the man selling the newspaper,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of November signaled the end of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a campaign that students and faculty capped off Monday night with a panel on domestic and sexual violence.
More than 30 students came together for the panel, which was sponsored by seven on-campus organizations, including The Harvard Foundation, the International Women’s Rights Collective, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Panelists, who each represented a marginalized community, discussed the misconceptions behind sexual violence.
Kendra Graves, member of the Hispanic Black Gay Coalition, said it is a common misconception that individuals know they are being abused but are afraid to speak up. On the contrary, she said, victims and perpetrators may view domestic violence as a norm, not a problem.
“You have to realize that your relationship is abusive,” Graves said.
Sarah Rankin, director of OSAPR, added that certain marginalized populations have extra pressure on them to suppress these experiences for fear of bringing negative attention to their communities.
At Harvard, Rankin said, there is a particular need to re-frame the conversation surrounding healthy relationships and sex.
“There is a certain pressure that men face here around their sexual conquests or experiences,” Rankin said. “We need to have more open conversations about what we’re really trying to get out of relationships.”
Christopher H. Cleveland ’14 asked panelists why sexual abuse may be more common on college campuses. He added that there is a need to focus on sexual encounters between students particularly when alcohol is involved.
“To everyone in the room fighting against this rape culture, this is where we start,” he said. “Let’s put up flyers saying ‘Alcohol: No Sex’.”
But even in communities where sexual violence is acknowledged, panelists said that there is a stigma attached to seeking help, which needs to be fixed.
“Part of the stigmatization rises from the culture of silence that we engage in to protect ourselves,”  said Julie Kahn-Schaye, a director at the Transition House, a domestic violence agency in Boston.
To conclude, panel moderator Kirin Gupta ’16 said, “This is definitely a conversation we want to move forward. We need to bring this conversation into our various communities.”

As red, white, and blue privacy curtains were set up in the City Hall basement Monday night in preparation for the election, the Cambridge City Council convened upstairs to revisit a heated discussion about voter accessibility.
The debate was over a malfunctioning elevator at the Baldwin School polling location in north Cambridge, which was out of service in the September primaries.
At the last City Council meeting, the Election Commission maintained that no action was taken to fix the elevator. The Commission said they were unaware it was broken.
However, a report released this week revealed that the polling place’s warden informed office staff that the elevator was not in service at 6:45 a.m.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker filed a complaint with the city manager’s office after seeing the elevator was still broken around 1 p.m.
“This kind of casual and complacent approach to handling a major disruption and barrier into voter accessibility is really disconcerting,” Decker said.
City Manager Robert W. Healy admitted that the situation could have been handled better.
“We’re all human beings,” Healy said.
Decker concluded the discussion by requesting the city manager’s office review the issue again. Decker also plans to discuss the matter with the Massachusetts Secretary of State.
Also on the Council’s agenda was a report from the city manager about installing more parking meters that accept credit cards in addition to quarters.
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. was particularly vocal in his opposition to new meters, expressing concern that the only way to offset the implementation costs would be to raise existing parking rates significantly.
Though the city manager’s report noted a slight uptick in revenue from parking meters that accept credit cards, it concluded that an additional increase in parking fees would be necessary to install more of them.
Councillor Craig A. Kelley suggested that the city was losing out on revenue by undercharging for parking.
Toomey, however, was left unconvinced.
“Everybody loves these newfangled things we’re going to do, but sometimes simple is the best,” Toomey said.
The meeting closed with a brief discussion of a citizen’s concern about dog owners not cleaning up after their pets on a children’s playground at Paine Park.
Councillors E. Denise Simmons and Leland Cheung agreed that the matter should be pursued by the Council.
“Happy to pick this up for Vice Mayor Simmons,” Cheung said.
“No pun intended,” Kelley deadpanned.

A week after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, the Harvard Red Cross kicked off a fundraiser Sunday with the goal of raising one thousand dollars for hurricane victims.
According to Victoriya Levina ’14, co-president of the Harvard Red Cross, the funds will be spent on various relief efforts, like “providing pillows, blankets, and meals for people that have been displaced from their homes.”
Donations to the group are tax-deductible and will go directly to the American Red Cross.
“We want to get as many people as possible to donate as much as they can,” Levina said. “A lot of times people are hesitant because they feel that what they can donate won’t make much of a difference, but if everyone in the Harvard community donated a dollar we would be able to exceed our goal.”
Levina noted that the drive received 196 hits within six hours of launching the on Causes.com, a website that facilitates fundraising.
Although Boston escaped the worst of Sandy, the storm took a serious toll on many students’ families
Rachel E. Halperin ’16, from Scarsdale, New York, said she thought her family was lucky it only lost power for a week.
According to Halperin, although the power is back, a continuing lack of gas means her family’s home still does not have heating.
Ryan A. Neff ’13 retured home to northern New Jersey last Sunday to be with his family when the storm hit.
“I was in New Jersey because my family wanted to be together during the hurricane,” he said. “I taped up windows, stocked up on flashlights, batteries, food, and four days worth of water.”
Neff, a native New Jersey resident, said he had never seen anything like Sandy.
“The winds were ferocious, and it wasn’t just that we had high sustained winds of 50 miles per hour, but you would stick your head out the window a few times just to see what was going on, and the wind would smack back your face and knock over everything in your room.”
As the families of many Harvard students continue to cope with the storm’s destruction, Levina hopes members of the Harvard community will contribute to the Harvard Red Cross fundraiser.
“[Students] can really make a difference in the efforts to help people who have been affected,” she said. “Even if we don’t know those who were affected by the hurricane, it’s still our job to help those in need.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past spring, Mitt Romney made an odd accusation of Barack Obama.
“We have a president who I think is a nice guy, but he spent too much time at Harvard perhaps,” Romney told supporters at a rally.
But so had Romney. Like the president, he graduated from Harvard with a law degree; in addition, he received an MBA from the Business School. Nevertheless, Romney was expressing a skepticism and disdain that is representative of much of the country’s opinion on degrees from elite institutions.
While there are many proud graduates of Harvard running for office, around the country some Harvard alums jockeying for a seat on Capitol Hill are doing their best to avoid “the H-word.” Sometimes an asset, sometimes a liability, a degree from Harvard has proved to be a touchy subject on the campaign trail.
THE H-BOMB
Joseph A. Selvaggi, the Republican challenging incumbent Stephen F. Lynch in Massachusetts’ 8th District, was strolling the paths of Harvard Yard only a few months ago.
Selvaggi graduated from the Kennedy School of Government this past spring and immediately entered the Republican primary.
While Selvaggi acknowledged that “the ink might still be wet on my diploma,” he’s not exactly quick to reminisce about his Harvard days, at least not on the campaign trail.
“I don’t lead with it,” Selvaggi said of his Masters in Public Policy. “I keep it, in a sense, close to the vest.”
Even when people ask directly about his time in Cambridge, Selvaggi says that he often deliberately refers to HKS as “the Kennedy School,” dropping the Harvard affiliation. “If you can avoid the H-word, and just say ‘the Kennedy School,’” he said, “that solves all your problems.”
The negative associations with Harvard can come from both sides of the aisle, according to Selvaggi. “As a Republican coming from the Kennedy School, some people are suspicious, like I’m a Manchurian candidate if I’ve even set foot in Cambridge,” he said.
There is also a concern from Republican Party leaders, that a candidate with a Harvard degree might not be conservative enough on certain issues. “[People worry] that you’re not willing to beat the drum of partisanship if you’ve spent enough time in Cambridge, [that it might] soften your perspective.”
Paul Heroux, another Kennedy School graduate who is running for Congress, has found that while many supporters have no problem with his Harvard connection, his degree can rub opponents—and perhaps undecided voters—the wrong way.
“I think my supporters like the fact that I went to Harvard,” he said, “and [I think] my opponents don’t like the fact that I went there…they take cheap shots about it.”
But even though he lists his Masters in Public Policy along with his other education on all mailings and campaign literature, Heroux said he leaves his Harvard spirit behind when he is on the campaign trail.
“When I’m knocking on doors talking to people, I never mention it,” he said. Heroux said he also does not mention his degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the London School of Economics.
“I’m also not running on the fact that I worked in a prison or that I’ve worked as a teacher. What I’m running on are the issues. So having that [degree] on my resume is nice, but it isn’t one of my talking points,” Heroux said.
A spokeswoman for Congressman Lynch, who also received a Masters in Public Policy from the Kennedy School, declined to comment for this article.
FINDING THE POSITIVES
Scott N. Howell, a Democrat challenging Republican Senator Orrin Hatch in the Utah Senate race, said he is upfront about his Harvard experience.
Howell completed Harvard Business School’s Executive Education program in 2003 with a grant from his employer, IBM.
He also served on the Kennedy School’s Harvard Policy Group.
“We actually highlighted it [on the campaign trail],” Howell said of his Harvard connections, “because I think that the experience I had there was really relevant about the unification process of what government could be, should be, what it is, and what it isn’t.”
If anything, Howell said, he has encountered more positive than negative reactions to his time at Harvard.
“The stigma’s actually been positive,” he said. “Educated voters appreciate it. Sometimes people might look at you and say, ‘you think you’re better than us,’ but to be honest I haven’t really encountered that.”
Sean Bielat, another Massachusetts Republican who is challenging Joseph Kennedy in the Massachusetts’ 4th District, has also found a place for Harvard in his campaign. “I don’t de-emphasize Harvard,” he said.
Instead, Bielat said he looks to stress how he ended up at Harvard—through hard work and scholarship funding from the GI Bill—a message he believes has a positive impact on voters. “I don’t necessarily come from a family where it was a big tradition to go an Ivy League School,” he said.
A QUEST FOR CREDIBILITY
Despite Selvaggi’s tendency to keep his Harvard degree “close to the vest,” he said that he has found that a connection to Harvard gives him credibility among some voters. “People assume [that] if you’ve been vetted by Harvard you must not be a dope,” he said.
In fact, Selvaggi said that he was motivated to enroll at the Kennedy School in part to get experience in the political sphere and bolster his legitimacy as a candidate.
“My aspirations have always been to get into politics, into public service,” said Selvaggi, who previously ran a small business that sells children’s toys. “My hope in going to the Kennedy School was to learn how policy affects the business climate and the climate of serving the average citizen.”
Heroux said he also saw the Kennedy School as sort of a primer in politics. He decided to pursue a Masters in Public Administration “because that was a very flexible program where I could take courses on a wide variety of different things that concern the public sector, stuff that I didn’t have much of a background in,” he said.
Congressman James R. Langevin enrolled at the Kennedy School while serving as a representative in Rhode Island’s State House because he “was looking to become a better legislator,” he said.
While Langevin said he does not lead off his stump speech with a reference to his Cambridge days, Langevin is adamant that his experience at Harvard has been a great asset.
“I learned valuable lessons about decision making and governance in general,” he said.
“I’m always proud to say that I went to the Kennedy School.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Transportation Services is working on a new initiative to install electronic screens at shuttle stops that would indicate arrival times, Harvard Transportation Services General Manager David E. Harris, Jr. said during a Shuttle Town Hall Monday night.
The town hall was co-sponsored by the Undergraduate Council, Office of Student Life, and Harvard Transportation Services to gauge student demand for expanded services.
The town hall included presentations by Harris, Interim Associate Dean for Student Life David R. Friedrich, and Managing Director of Transportation Services John Nolan.
During the discussion, many students expressed their frustration with the accuracy of the shuttle schedule.
Samuel M. Meyer ’13 said there was a discrepancy between the schedule posted on the Transportation Services website and the real-time results.
He said the 12:20 “phantom shuttle” at the Quad was an example of when a shuttle time was listed on the website but did not actually arrive.
“Why does the information posted on your website not reflect real [shuttle times]?” Meyer said. “Who in your office decided to do that?”
However, Harris said that shuttles ran on time at least 82 percent of the time for the Quad—Stadium shuttle and 92 percent of the time for the Quad Express shuttle.
Students at the Town Hall also requested that the weekend morning shuttle be reinstated and the Extended Overnight Shuttle run more frequently.
However, Nolan said that it is challenging for Transportation Services to balance both student feedback and the needs of both Quad and River House residents.
“Understanding what the gaps in service are and trying to quantify them is difficult,” Nolan said.
According to the UC Student Life Committee Chair Michael C. George ’14, the UC has worked this semester to petition the University for an increase in the shuttle services budget after significant cuts were made in 2010.
George, who is also a Crimson news editor, is also a candidate for UC presidency.
Earlier this year, Pforzheimer resident Danielle S. Suh ’15 circulated a petition to expand shuttle services. The petition garnered more than 1,000 signatures.

CORRECTION: Nov. 26

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—As polls across Massachusetts closed at 8 p.m., both campaigns for U.S. Senate said they were cautiously optimistic heading into what could be a long night of ballot counting.
At the Fairmont Copley Plaza, upbeat supporters of Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren began gathering in the lobby and in a red, white, and especially blue-themed ballroom for what they hope will be a celebratory night.
Early estimates indicate that voter turnout across the state is approaching a record high, which should help Democrat Warren, who has had a slight edge over Brown in recent polls. Warren’s campaign manager Doug Rubin said the first-time candidate had stopped at eight or nine polling stations throughout the day in a last-minute push to win over undecided voters.
“I feel like we’ve done everything we wanted to do from a campaign perspective. We’ve gotten a lot of people out and excited about Elizabeth,” Rubin said. “Now we’ve just got to wait and see.”
Three blocks away at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, Brown supporters gathered around televisions watching early returns roll in, anticipating an evening that they hope will include a victory for Brown.
Though most attendees at the Brown party agreed that a high turnout would be favorable for Warren, Republican officials said that early reports were positive for Brown.
“By the early counts that we’ve seen, turnout has been extremely high just about everywhere. It’s extremely high in some of the suburbs,” said Tim Buckley, director of communications for the Massachusetts GOP. “The Route 128 belt, the South Shore, and up in the North Shore...those areas are extremely good for Senator Brown. In those areas he carried 65-70 percent of the vote in the special election.”
Buckley said that some reports suggest that turnout in major cities, where Warren is heavily favored, was not prohibitively high.
Even as they expect him to win, many of Brown’s supporters said that he is the underdog, outmatched by Warren’s significant ground operation and political advantage in the left-leaning Massachusetts.
“With the entire Democratic apparatus in Massachusetts...lined up against him, if [he] comes through and delivers on Election Day, I’d call it a bit of an upset,” said former Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles D. Baker ’79.
“But just because it’s an upset doesn’t mean it’s not what I expected to happen,” Baker added. “I always thought that Scott would get re-elected, because he deserves to be re-elected.”
Supporters in both ballrooms and at the Hynes Convention Center across town, where supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney are gathered, eagerly await the results from across the state and around the country.

Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren handily defeated U.S. Senator Scott Brown Tuesday night, becoming the first woman elected to the United States Senate in Massachusetts history and reclaiming for her party the seat held for decades by Democratic legend Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
Though early in the night it looked as if the margin of victory might be narrow, Warren ultimately beat Brown by 10 points, 54 percent to 46 percent, riding the wave of Democratic support in Massachusetts that also led President Barack Obama to a large margin of victory in the state.
Addressing a crowd of cheering supporters at the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Back Bay after her victory Tuesday night, Warren stressed campaign trail promises to champion the struggling middle class and be a liberal bastion for the people of Massachusetts.
“For every family that has been chipped at, squeezed, and hammered, we’re going to fight for a level playing field,” Warren said. “To all the small business owners tired of a system rigged against them, we’re going to hold the big guys accountable.”
“I won’t just be your senator, I will be your champion,” she concluded.
Warren’s victory Tuesday night cemented Democratic control of the Senate. She has pledged to work to raise taxes on the nation’s top earners and cut military spending in order to reinvest in infrastructure, jobs, and education.
“This Warren victory is just one of many victories that the Democrats are rolling up,” Kennedy School professor Richard D. Parker said.
At press time, Democrats had won 22 of 33 Senate seats on the ballot Tuesday according to New York Times projections. The Republicans were projected to win the House and at press time had won seven Senate seats.
Though her victory was a reaffirmation of the Bay State’s traditionally Democratic politics, Warren expressed her appreciation for Brown’s efforts at bipartisanship, saying she will work across the aisle in Washington.
“I also want to say tonight to Senator Brown’s supporters, the message you sent was clear. We need more leaders in Washington who are willing to break the partisan gridlock and work regardless of party,” Warren said. “I know I didn’t earn your vote, but I promise to work to win your support.”
Political experts have called Warren’s win a “return to normalcy” for left-leaning Massachusetts. The closeness of the race over the last year speaks to Brown’s popularity and moderate politics, but Tuesday night’s result makes his 2010 special election victory look more like an aberration than indicative of a new political norm.
After a hard-fought and at times bitter race, Brown graciously conceded the race to Warren in front of his downcast supporters at the Park Plaza Hotel, just blocks away from Warren’s celebration unfolding at the Fairmont.
“She has received the high honor of holding the people’s seat,” Brown said. “May she bring that senate office great credit.”
Hinting that another run might still be in his future, Brown said “defeat is only temporary” and reminded supporters that politics is about responding to the will of the people. He said he leaves office as dedicated to independent politics as when he entered it.
“As you know, it’s been two statewide campaigns in three years.... What matters even more is what we achieved in between these two elections.” Brown said. “I kept my promise to you to be that independent voice to Massachusetts, and I have never ever, ever, regretted any decision I made for you.”
The same combination of moderate political stances and personal appeal that led to Brown’s victory in 2010 often made it seem that he could pull off reelection. Warren struggled to gain political footing early in the campaign and even as Massachusetts enthusiastically supported the president, his former adviser initially failed to win over the independents and conservative Democrats who helped elect Brown in 2010.
Ultimately those groups sufficiently coalesced around Warren as she tapped the combined benefits of near-record voter turnout and an unparalleled grassroots ground game.
Though not all the votes had been tabulated at press time, voter turnout in Massachusetts topped three million, approaching a record high.
In the Democratic strongholds of Boston and Cambridge, Warren won 74 percent and 85 percent, respectively. But she was also able to cut into Brown’s margins along the North and South shores, where he won convincingly in 2010.
Warren campaign volunteers knocked on over 200,000 doors and made 600,000 phone calls the weekend before Election Day, according to the campaign’s press secretary Alethea Harney. They expected to have deployed some 20,000 volunteers by the time polls closed Tuesday.
“This was a campaign that broke records, raising more money from small donors than any Senate campaign before it, knocking on more doors,” Warren said. “And let me be clear, I didn’t build that, you built that.”
Both Brown and Warren were boosted throughout the year-long race by a great deal of out-of-state financial and organizational support. The match-up proved to be the most expensive and hotly contested Congressional race in the country, costing more than $68 million and prompting a parade of national political figures to weigh in on both sides.
Warren, 63, began her career at the University of Houston Law Center in the late 1970s and spent more than three decades climbing the academic ladder as a legal expert focusing on consumer finance. She gained national prominence as the chief regulator for the government’s TARP bailout program in 2008 and then as the intellectual founder of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Warren has been the Leo Gottleib professor of Law at Harvard since 1995 and her husband, Bruce H. Mann, is a professor at the Law School. Warren, who has been on leave since declaring her candidacy for Senate last fall, will vacate her professorship officially at the end of the semester.

Under strings of lights and patriotic red, white, and blue stars, students milled about the JFK Forum, eagerly looking up at the jumbotron and engaging in lively conversation at the Institute of Politics’ election night watch party.
“It’s really electrifying. Everyone is anticipating what’s going to happen next,” said Carolyn L. Roederer ’15.
Supporters rooted and cheered for their favorite political candidates.  Friends embraced, jumping up and down when Law School professor Elizabeth Warren won the Massachusetts senatorial race.
Turnout at the Institute of Politics watch party was overwhelmingly and unsurprisingly Democrat. According to Roederer, this may be in part because Romney supporters were drawn to watch election results at Romney headquarters in Boston.
Although the event felt Democrat-heavy according to students, they agreed that the IOP did a good job hosting a bipartisan event.
IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson '94 called David Axelrod, senior adviser to Obama, to comment on preliminary election results at 9 p.m. Alexrod, who was broadcast over speakerphone, spoke optimistically about early votes in Ohio and thanked the crowd gathered in the forum.
"I applaud anyone participating in the process, for what we need are bright young people getting involved.... Whether you support President Obama or Governor Romney, the fact that you're in the arena is meaningful for me," Axelrod said.
Phillip A. Acevedo ’13 came to the election party donning a Captain America costume and Uncle Sam hat.
“People have been asking me for pictures,” Acevedo said. “I wanted to portray the spirit of the night.”

Although the women’s hockey goalies Laura Bellamy and Emerance Maschmeyer may have gotten this week’s The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week award, plenty of other Harvard athletes submitted excellent performances over the last week that merited recognition of their own.
Colton Chapple, Football
Although lifted before the second half began, senior quarterback Colton Chapple played well in his thirty minutes of work—contributing four touchdowns in the team’s 69-0 victory over the Columbia Lions. Chapple tossed three touchdown passes in the game’s first five minutes and had only five incompletions en route to racking up 213 yards of total offense. Chapple has 21 total touchdowns in the season and his 273 yards per game through the air rank this season, second only to Cornell’s Jeff Mathews.
Kyle Criscuolo, Men’s Hockey
Over the weekend freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo added two goals and an assist as the team split decisions against Brown and Yale. Criscuolo scored the only goal for the 13th-ranked Crimson as Harvard dropped a 5-1 decision against the Bulldogs on Saturday, and his goal proved to be the difference as the team topped Brown 3-2 on Friday night. Criscuolo has twelve shots on goal for the season, eight in conference play.
Brooke Dickens, Women’s Soccer
With the Harvard women’s soccer team in danger of going into overtime against Columbia, freshman forward Brooke Dickens took the game into her own hands. Collecting a pass from senior forward Aisha Price at the top of the penalty box, Dickens tapped the ball past the Lions goalkeeper and headed the ball into the back of the net with five seconds left. It was Dickens’ first goal of the season, and it sent the team’s seniors off with a win, the last of the 39 they helped the Crimson to over the past four years.
Sarah Edney, Women’s Hockey
Sophomore defender Sarah Edney helped lead Harvard to a pair of wins over the weekend against Ancient Eight foes Brown and Yale. Edney chipped in three assists against Yale, a 4-0 victory that brought the sixth-ranked Crimson to 5-0 on the season. Edney has five total assists so far and posted her third straight game of positive plus/minus against Yale, finishing with a +2 on the game and a +7 in her last three contests.
Chris Splinter, Football
While the big story of the game was the way the Harvard offense played, senior defensive back Chris Splinter led the Crimson defense as it smothered a struggling Columbia attack. Splinter had two interceptions—his third and fourth of the season—that he returned deep into Columbia territory to create short fields for the opposition. Splinter helped the Crimson hold the Lions to 149 yards of total offense, including -19 total rushing yards.
Damani Wilson, Football
In only eight carries of work, junior running back Damani Wilson—who doubles as one of the team’s defensive backs—contributed 121 yards and two touchdowns. Wilson broke two long scoring runs in the second half in which he sprinted past Lion defenders, including a 43-yard scamper that provided the game’s final score. Wilson averaged 15 yards per rush—nearly twice what he had rushed for as a whole before Saturday’s game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two games left, the Harvard football team’s offense is well on pace to eclipse or challenge several single-season offensive marks. The Crimson’s historic 69-0 obliteration of Columbia last Saturday sure helped. Here’s a look at how Harvard’s 2012 offensive stats match up against previous seasons and program bests.
19: Number of points Harvard must average over its last two games to tie the Crimson record for most points scored in a modern era season. Harvard set the record last year with 374 points.
+229: The Crimson’s current point-differential. Harvard’s largest point differential of the modern era is +205 from 2004.
0.1%: Difference between Colton Chapple’s completion percentage through eight games (66.0%) and the Harvard single-season mark (66.1%) set by Neil Rose ’03 in 2002.
1: Number of touchdowns tight end Kyle Juszczyk needs to tie for the second-most Harvard receiving touchdowns in a single-season. Juszczyk has recorded seven TDs through eight games; Carl Morris '03 set the single-season record of 12 in 2001.
3: Number of Crimson running backs who have rushed for more touchdowns than Trevor Scales in a single season. Clifton Dawson '07’s single-season marks of 20 and 17 from 2006 and 2004, respectively, appear unassailable, but Scales, who has recorded 11 TDs so far, would be the next-best with three more over the next two games.
308.5: Yards of total offense Harvard must average over its next two games in order to tie the Crimson record for most yards of total offense in a single season. Through eight weeks, Harvard has averaged 507.75 yards per game.
1893: Last season in which a Crimson team has broken the 50-point threshold in multiple games in a single season. In 1893, Harvard defeated Exeter, 54-0; Williams, 52-0; Brown, 58-0; and Andover, 60-5. The Crimson has defeated Holy Cross, 52-3, and Columbia, 69-0, in 2012.

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team, ranked No.6 in the country, is not simply winning—it is dominating. Both games this past weekend ended in shutouts after Brown and Yale failed to get the puck past co-captain goalie Laura Bellamy and freshman goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, respectively.
The two victories extended the Crimson’s winning streak to four games to begin the season. Harvard has won its first four consecutive games only four times in program history, with the last time occurring in the 2007-2008 season. The Crimson’s defense has only allowed one goal so far this season, a large testament to the skill of the team’s goaltenders.
“Both [Bellamy and Maschmeyer] have been incredible for us between the pipes so far,” co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey said. “There is a certain confidence playing up front knowing that one of them is in goal because not only are they very skilled and reliable, but they work extremely hard to improve on their game, always sticking around for extra shots or working with me one versus one on breakaway moves or tough shots to save, helping me get better on my game.”
Bellamy and Maschmeyer split time in the goal and together have totaled 63 saves for the season thus far. Bellamy registered five saves against the Bears on Friday, and Maschmeyer recorded 12 saves against the Bulldogs on Saturday.
“We spent so much time down [on the offensive end],” Bellamy said. “When it does come down to our end, our defense is doing a great job of keeping the shots minimal and clearing, so our job [as goalies] has been pretty easy so far.”
Harvard’s win against Brown marked Bellamy’s 16th career shutout. The senior now holds second place for the highest number of shutouts in Crimson program history.
“It’s a great honor,” Bellamy said. “There are a lot of great goalies to go through this program, and I played with one of them three years ago, Kristi Kessler. She’s been a huge role model for me. Ali Boe is also one of the best goalies in this program, and to be in the same breath as those guys is really an honor.”
Bellamy has not allowed any goals against in her two starts this season.
“Our defense has been playing really well, and our offense, too,” Bellamy said. “A big reason we’ve only given up one goal is because of how the team is playing, so we are just hoping to keep it up.”
Prior to this weekend, Bellamy registered another shutout with 30 saves against Quinnipiac, putting her total number of saves for the season at 35. Last season the co-captain registered 679 saves over the span of 32 Harvard matches.
“We do a little handshake before every opening face-off, which really gets us fired up,” Dempsey said. “And we have little pre-game sayings that we toss around, like, ‘Here’s to being the hunter,’—one of our mindsets for the season. Being co-captain with her is perfect because I think we complement each other well in terms of our leadership. It is always so easy to talk about anything with her, and she communicates well with both the coaches and players.”
Maschmeyer also had a strong finish this past weekend against Yale. The freshman goalie blocked all 12 Bulldog shots, ultimately ending the game with a 4-0 shutout win.
“Emerance is a great goalie,” Bellamy said. “She’s coming from Team Canada, and she’s done a great job with them. I love having that competition in practice every day. She’s a competitor. We both want to be in the net, so right now we’re doing a great job of playing off of each other. It’s been great. I really like playing with her.”
The freshman is off to an impressive start to her Crimson career. Now with a personal 2-0 record, Maschmeyer has a 0.50 goals against average, only allowing one goal so far this season.
Earlier in the season, Maschmeyer experienced her first Harvard win in goal in a 9-1 bout against Princeton. Maschmeyer is the first Crimson goalie in all-time history to win her first start.
“All of us freshmen have a lot of good upperclassmen to look up to, and they help us out a lot,” Maschmeyer said. “Just having a really good team helps a lot with the transition. For me especially, I played away from home last year, so coming here and playing away from home wasn’t a big difference, which helps a lot.”
All four of Harvard’s wins have been on the road this season, a feat only accomplished once before in program history. The Crimson will not see a home game until Thanksgiving weekend when the team matches up against Colgate and Cornell.
“It’s been great to have such a great start, and to have it come on the road has been a lot about how we’re coming together as a team right off the bat,” Bellamy said. “But it’s going to be nice being at home and being a little more comfortable in our zone.”
No. 6 Harvard is looking to extend its 4-0 record, and Bellamy and Maschmeyer are planning on making Crimson shutouts a regular occurrence this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week’s hurricane brought the most memorable weather in recent memory.  It canceled sporting events around the country, including the New York City Marathon and the season-opening game between the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets.
At the beginning of last week it appeared that the Harvard sailing team would not compete in the Hap Moore Trophy Regatta. Yet, through the efforts of coaches and organizers, the regatta went on, and the Crimson placed third out of eight teams.
The United States Coast Guard Academy, the host of the event, canceled the regatta earlier in the week. The Academy was unable to host the event due to storm-related damage.
As a result, the regatta moved just north to Connecticut College, and racers sailed on Camel Pond. Four teams from the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association could not make it to the relocated regatta. Each of the eight remaining teams, including Harvard, came from the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association.
According to Crimson head coach Mike O’Connor, the hectic schedule changes did not affect the team.
“We were preparing for the regatta regardless of what was going to happen,” O’Connor said. “We didn’t think it had any negative effect.”
The racers faced varying winds throughout the weekend.  Moderate winds blew all day on Saturday, but they died a little on the following day despite high-knot winds in the morning.
Harvard’s sailors started performing slowly but progressed throughout the weekend.
“Our performance on Saturday was not quite as good as we would have liked,” O’Connor said. “Our performance on Sunday was maybe a little bit better, so overall we are happy with the results. We didn’t start very well on Saturday, and we did much better on Sunday. I think our results reflected that [and] I think we only lost one race on Sunday.”
The Crimson finished with nine wins and five losses on the weekend. Boston College dominated the competition, finishing with 13 wins and one loss. Last weekend’s regatta was scored in the fleet-racing format, as opposed to the usual team-racing scoring system.
Hurricane Sandy also altered Harvard’s upcoming regatta. On October 27, the Crimson qualified for the Co-ed Atlantic Coast Championship regatta with a seventh place finish in the Schell Trophy Regatta. Harvard earned its post-season berth in dramatic fashion. Only the top-eight finishers made it through to ACC’s, and the Crimson won the final spot by tallying just one point fewer than the team from the University of Vermont.
The Merchant Marine Academy was supposed to host the championship in King’s Point, N.Y., but the Academy canceled due to complications from Hurricane Sandy, and the event organizers moved the regatta to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.
Soon after, the Naval Academy canceled the event because some of the eighteen teams were unable to make it to the championships. The event will not be changed to another location.
Harvard will now compete in a nine-boat regatta comprised of teams from the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association.
Junior captain Ben Lamont says that the team will not alter its focus despite the cancelation of the championship.
“It won’t affect our preparations too much,” Lamont said. “This regatta will be the culmination of a lot of hard work this fall. The real championship events occur this spring. Although this [regatta] is important to us, we are looking at it as a stepping-stone to improving in the winter, in the offseason, and in the spring when our season restarts.”
When asked what the team needs for a successful final regatta, O’Connor stressed the importance of improvement in his team’s starts.
“Overall as a team the one thing we can do in all of our regattas is consistently get good starts,” O’Connor said. “We have been inconsistent in getting good starts, and until we can do that we are going to have a hard time knowing just how good we can be.”
No matter what happens this weekend, Lamont and his teammates will be proud of their accomplishments.
“We knew we were on the cusp of qualifying, so qualifying was an accomplishment for us,” Lamont said. “It demonstrates some of the hard work people have put in and the improvement that we have made over the course of this fall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many kids, the dream of playing professional sports drives athletic careers. Yet for most people the dream does not work out. Recently, however, a number of Harvard alumni have been blazing a trail for an alternative route to the big leagues: using statistics and skillful networking to place them in the front office of major sports organizations.
Two recent graduates, Jason Rosenfeld ’12 and Daniel Adler ’10 have started to implant themselves in the front offices of teams in two of the biggest sports leagues in the world: the NBA and the NFL. Rosenfeld is the Manager of Basketball Analytics for the Charlotte Bobcats, and Adler is the Assistant Director of Football Research for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Both are living their dreams, continuing a passion they developed at Harvard while a part of the Harvard Sports Analysts Collective (HSAC), a popular sports analysis club on campus. Other members of HSAC have worked for the Phoenix Suns of the NBA and the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL, as well as other teams and sports-related companies and organizations.
The statistical movement in sports started with baseball. In 1977, Bill James, a janitor who spent his spare time analyzing baseball statistics, published his work and created what is now known as sabermetrics. While at first many people involved in the industry of sports were skeptical, claiming that conventional wisdom trumped the power of statistics, James’ method slowly gained traction throughout the baseball world.
Michael Lewis’ novel Moneyball—published in 2003—tracked the Oakland A’s, a small-market team that managed to make the playoffs through the brilliance of a statistically-inclined general manager and an artfully crafted low-budget team. The book was so influential that it was turned into a movie, starring Brad Pitt, in 2011.
But baseball, based around one-on-one matchups between a batter and a pitcher is much more constrained, and therefore lends itself to more extensive quantitative analysis. Even before James’ statistical revolution, stats like batting average, home runs, and runs batted in have been tracked for well over a century and been part of the sports parlance. But more free flowing sports like basketball and football don’t lend themselves as easily to recording meaningful in-game stats.
“It’s important to keep in mind how much more complicated basketball is than baseball,” Rosenfeld said. “You could create a formula to give you a number [that represents a player’s effectiveness] and that may be effective in baseball, but it might not be nearly as effective [in basketball].”
Take, for example, a touchdown in football. The running back or wide receiver-quarterback tandem gets credit for a TD, but the result is not completely dependent on their play. Offensive lines, other skill players, and play calling all have a role. Similarly in basketball, a basket is generally not scored by the sheer power of one player, but by a symphonic union of five who each influence the play on the floor.
“On any given play [in basketball], if you are trying to figure out what’s good or not, you have to divide credit, and that’s going to be hard. It’s a lot more complicated,” Rosenfeld said.
For this reason, the statistical movement has only recently entrenched itself in these sports. But recently teams across the league are beginning to realize the value added by these analytical thinkers. All the way up to the general manager position, teams are turning to guys who analyze numbers for advice.
“[In] basketball, it’s really the past five-to-ten years where [statistical analysis] has been really mainstream,” Rosenfeld said.
In 2007, Daryl Morey, a former computer science major out of Northwestern University and graduate of the MIT Sloan business school, became one of the first general managers who got to his position by fully embracing sports analytics. He is still the GM for the Houston Rockets and also co-runs the annual MIT Sloan Sports Conference.
While the nature of both Adler and Rosenfeld’s jobs are secretive, the general area that they influence their teams in is through draft analysis along with in-game scenario decision making.
“A lot of the stuff revolves around [game] decisions like if on fourth down, whether to punt or go for a field goal,” Adler said.
In 2005, political economy professor David Romer of UC Berkeley published an article entitled “Do Firms Maximize? Evidence from Professional Football,” which concluded that coaches often tend towards conservative choices that—at least from an analytical perspective—do not provide the best opportunity for winning.
A lot of the sports analytic movement has worked towards maximizing productivity.
“There has been research on the draft on how you value certain draft picks—whether you trade down,” Adler added.
Basketball statisticians have also recently developed stats such as player efficiency ratings (PER) and value added—which dig deeper than just points, assists, rebounds, and turnovers—to rate a player’s true value. Last year, the NBA MVP LeBron James did not actually lead the league in value added; instead, that distinction went to James Harden. While players may not shoot for “value added” titles the way they do for scoring titles, these can often be a more accurate indicator of the impact a single player has on his team’s ability to win.
In front offices, decision-making is often driven by these statistics.
“There are a ton of different decisions that a basketball team needs to make,” Rosenfeld said. “As a fan, you kind of get an idea of what decisions are important for a team… but once you are actually working for a team, you end up with even more questions. Most of the front offices are trying to answer these questions. The difference with me is I—using statistics—try to look at them, hopefully, different than other people.”
In order to attain a lifelong dream, both Adler and Rosenfeld did not get to their positions without hard work. A brief look at Rosenfeld’s resume shows the extensive list of internships and jobs he held before he ended up with the Bobcats. A statistics concentrator at Harvard, he started working in the NBA as an intern in the basketball operations department for the Rockets, working remotely while at Harvard from 2007 to 2009.
Through a series of serendipitous events he became the assistant GM of a Chinese basketball team, the Shanghai Sharks, taking a year off from the college in 2009-2010 to fulfill his duties.
“Unlike the Rockets [job], I was on-site…. That was my life,” Rosenfeld explained.
In the summer after his junior year, Rosenfeld consulted for the Ukrainian national team while they were at the FIBA European Basketball Championships, and finally he was the team manager for the Harvard men’s basketball team last year.
Adler also started early, working as an intern for the New England Patriots the summer after high school. Yet, like many interns at major corporations, he was not immediately doing the glory jobs. He continued to work for the Patriots while at Harvard and even joined the Crimson football team as a team assistant.
From there he bounced between leagues doing remote work for the Cleveland Browns as a “Football Administration Analyst” and working in the MLB labor relations department as a legal and economic intern. He fully credits his ability to land later jobs, however, to his early days with the Patriots.
“The way I fell into the Browns job was because I happened to meet someone when I was graduating high school who works for the Patriots,” Adler said. “I did total grunt work for them and things went from there.”
Before taking the Jaguars job, Adler was enrolled at the Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He also worked for the Boston Consulting Group for a year.
Both Adler and Rosenfeld emphasized that the most important thing going forward is that they love what they do. They feel as if they are a part of a team and whatever work they put in goes towards helping their team win.
“All we are trying to do is weigh things equally and overcome the human biases,” Adler said.
When his team suited up to play against the Packers two Sundays ago at Lambeau Field, Adler said it was one of the best moments of his career.
“I woke up this morning and I was headed, you know, I was heading over to Lambeau field to go to work,” Adler said. “My job is just pretty amazing. I go to the stadium every day and play around with football stats the whole day, which I would be doing anyway.”

If you're like the typical college student, you probably spent your Sunday watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" re-runs and procrastinating on homework. But several Harvard students spent their last day of the weekend running a marathon and raised $4,333 for Hurricane Sandy disaster relief in the process.
Meredith C. Baker '13 and Samantha J. Whitmore '13 began planning the event only last Wednesday. By the time the marathon ended Sunday afternoon, 180 students had RSVP’d for the event on Facebook. A group of 25 people started the race and six finished.
"Their mental support during the final stages of the race was invaluable," said Whitmore of the the other people who finished the marathon. "Three of them were experienced marathoners, so they gave wonderful advice."
Baker said she also appreciated the support of the other runners.
"It was really special to cross the finish line hand in hand with Sam, as we had been training for the NYC marathon for so long together," said Baker, who is also a Crimson editorial writer.
The pair had initially hoped to raise $2,620 for hurricane relief, but ended up bringing in close to $2,000 more than their original goal.
But running a 26.2 mile marathon and raising $4,333 for Hurricane Sandy disaster relief is just the beginning for Whitmore and Baker.
Along with Tyler Cusick '14, Whitmore and Baker have already started tentatively organizing an on campus benefit concert planned for later this week.
Whitmore said that she hopes the run, along with the other events that she and Baker are planning, will motivate other people to contribute to disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy.
"I hope it inspires others to try and make a difference in any way they can as well, because all the little things really do add up," Whitmore said.

Who knew "Professor" could be such an insult? Most people tend to give the position a certain degree of respect. Maybe it's all the years of classes, lectures, and endless papers it takes to get there, or maybe it's just the implied intellectual brilliance and academic success of the post.
Of course, it has long been said that politics plays by its own set of rules. Jerry J. Jasinowski began his endorsement of Senator Scott P. Brown in a Huffington Post blog post with a discussion of the title "Professor," not as a compliment but as a political affront.
Jasinowski's post is titled "The Harvard Stigma," a reference to challenger Elizabeth Warren's position as a Harvard Law School professor. Jasinowski describes Warren as "almost a caricature of the eastern liberal elite intellectual," emphasizing her liberal positions and "reputation for anti-business extremism." According to Jasinowski, "it would be interesting watching Warren tweaking conservative Republicans in the Senate, but that would be unlikely to foster consensus." While Jasinowski takes issue with what he sees as Warren's inability to be bipartisan, his main issue is that she holds the title of Professor and nothing else. "When they met in debates, Brown addressed her as Professor Warren which in this case was perfectly proper. It is the highest title she has ever held, and it accurately reflects her background and point of view," Jasinowski wrote.
Despite the title of his article, Jasinowski only makes passing references to the university in the post. In fact, he actually holds a degree from Harvard Business School himself. Which brings up the ultimate questioned raised by the article: like so much else in life, does "The Harvard Stigma" only exist in politics? The rest of the time, we just call it the H-bomb.

Check marks are great, grades at the top of the page  are often necessary, and sometimes corrections are required. But every  time a TF lets a little personality shine through in his or her feedback, that TF-student bond—in our minds,  at least—changes dramatically. Sometimes these personal notes fan the  flames of our TF appreciation, and sometimes they just give us even more  reason to fantasize about marking up their papers with red pen for  once. Here, FM rounds up some of the best of TF commentary.
