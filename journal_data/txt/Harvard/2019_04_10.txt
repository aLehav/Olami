After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I. Bright Colors, Stripes:
The first 10 years of my life are a blur; they have been pieced together from photo albums, home videos, and half-memories that come back to me without warning. I remember a “Jungle Book”-themed birthday party; all my parents’ friends and their children came to our small, dimly-lit apartment, decorated with cheap paintings, dusty couches, and moth-brown carpets, and a big, precious television in the living room. I walked through our house like a king, with a stuffed snake draped around my shoulders. They lifted me, fed me cake, and asked me how old I was. I thumped my chest and roared like Mowgli. Everyone laughed and clapped and pulled my cheeks, and sent me in the direction of my presents.
I was dressed by my mother, who, today, has a keen eye for fashion. 20 years ago, I’m not sure that she cared much for style; or if she did, she thought style was one of those grown-up things that children should not worry about. Then again, what do I know about fashion? Maybe my baby clothes were all the rage in Kolkata, maybe I was the envy of every toddler, maybe I was the reason they cried all night long, wailing, “I want to dress like Yash!”
I was most like myself then, when my mother dressed me. In the summer, she picked out pink shorts and yellow T-shirts and set me loose in our apartment complex’s parking lot. I came back in the afternoons, filthy and tired, but happy. In the winters, she gave me sweaters and thick beanies and asked me to stay indoors, where I would not fall sick.
Then, I ran and cried without a second thought. I repeated the words I heard my sister’s friends say without understanding them at all. I ate bowls and bowls of ice-cream and left the worrying (he’ll get a cold!) to my mother. All those years ago, I was true to my mind; and T. S. Eliot’s famous shadow — the one that is the color of hesitation and imperfection, that stretches between thought and action — did not exist. I was not hollow; I was full of instinct. But, this is before I had trouble deciphering what it meant to be Yash.
II. Blue and White, A Collar:
In the fifth grade, a friend had a pool party. Before anyone else was ready, I sprinted from the changing room and jumped straight into the pool, the first to enter and the last to leave. When everyone did cannonballs and belly-flops and whatever else thin children do, I counted the seconds I could hold my breath underwater. Photos from that day, eight years ago, feature only my head, bobbing on the surface.
My mother trained as a nutritionist, so that she could tell people what to eat and how they could lose weight. Growing up, before the world realized brown bread was healthier than white, my mother had replaced all the loaves in our home. She hid the cheese behind the tomatoes and the broccoli and locked the candy in a little storeroom across the hall from her bedroom. There was no soda in our fridge. A valiant effort — and still, I found the cheese, I found the storeroom key, and I solicited change from my friends to buy bottles of Sprite. My pockets sagged with illicit bars of chocolate, and the bananas my mother gave me every morning before school collected in the back of my locker.
In the eighth grade, I was nicknamed “Boobie,” for the way all the cheese had turned to fat around my chest. My wardrobe now consisted of four oversized T-shirts. My mother, still uneasy from her new lack of control over my clothing, shook her head angrily, telling me that I needed to wear other things — what would my teachers think?
Soon, the bright colors of my youth transitioned to bland shades of blue and gray and black — so much black! Black is the most slimming color, I read in a magazine once. My favorite shirt had a collar and was blue with white stripes. For some reason, I was convinced that in this T-shirt, nobody could tell just how big I was. I hunched my shoulders and sucked my tummy in, and never thought about anything other than protecting myself from the accusation that I was fat.
Now, years later, I wish I had done more then; I wish I had cannonballed and belly-flopped and jumped to be in photos with my friends. I wish I did more now, too! But then, hiding is what I thought it meant to be Yash — a slow crawl to the back of the room, the bottom of the pile, beneath layers and layers of big T-shirts and baggy shorts.
III. A Hoodie, GAP:
I’m wearing this hoodie right now, as I write. It is one size too big for me and always warm; it is like a big hug from my friends at home; it is like a lazy Sunday afternoon. My hoodie is not particularly special, yet it has become characteristic of my identity. So many small decisions have, unwittingly, become cornerstones to how people perceive me. But, when I stop to ask how I define myself, I have no answers.
* * *
I wish my parents had kept a tally of everything I’ve ever done. How many slices of pizza have I eaten? How many times have I cried? How many colds have I had? I’m not sure if this information would be useful; but, oh, how wonderful it would be to know I’ve cried one hundred and twenty three times! I wish they had kept a tally of all the things I didn’t do, the things I could have done. Maybe there is some hidden definition in these numbers; maybe I can scrape some sense of self, some secret, meaningful logic from a life’s worth of data?
Elizabeth Bishop, a poet close to my heart, has written extensively on identity. Her startling vision distinguishes clearly between artifice and reality; between what the world puts in our mind and what we create. In her poem “In the Waiting Room,” Bishop writes:
“Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?”
Why should I be Yash? There is no good reason. Bishop sees through the artifice of identity, the empty labels that we mindlessly race to pocket slyly, and, to me at least, says, sorrowfully, that there is little — possibly, nothing — special about us. Maybe we painstakingly build identities around shirts and half-memories. Maybe we believe that those selves are authentic, and maybe that works for some of us! But maybe there is no concrete sense of self to be found, after all. Maybe we’re all the same, and maybe that can be liberating, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s vote to fund Israeli Apartheid Week generated more conversation than anyone had expected. When prominent newspapers framed the UC decision as controversial, and when members of Harvard Hillel claimed that IAW risks the safety of Jewish students on campus, there is a need to remind ourselves of some definitions that were lost during this week.
I am an Israeli Jewish student and I am against the appeals made by some Hillel members to the UC. I am against the occupation, but my religion has nothing to do with it and neither does anyone else's religion. The situation in Israel-Palestine is political and is a matter of human rights and justice, not one of ideology or religion as we so often hear.
The fact that certain Jewish students feel attacked by IAW has no connection to their religious affiliation. These students feel attacked because of their political views. They feel attacked because they support a country that was politically criticized and condemned during the events held last week. As a Jewish Israeli student, IAW did not deal with my religion. It did, however, challenge the political actions of the country I come from. As long as we wish to adhere to democratic values, IAW, as any other political activity, should not be silenced.
The blur between anti-Semitism and criticism of Israel is a phenomenon that we should all resist. A religion and a government's policy are fundamentally different things. Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are not the same, and we should refrain from putting them under the same umbrella.
The fact that we even need to emphasize this raises concerns. Claiming that by criticizing Israel one makes a claim about Jewish people in general is in fact an anti-Semitic statement. There are many Jewish people around the world that have no connection to Israel. Jewish people, like anyone else, have the right to adopt their own political views. Attributing Zionism to any Jewish student on this campus violates their right to freedom of thought and as a Jewish student, I am glad that the UC decided to differentiate between the two.
Many people make this exact mistake by starting with a political argument that slowly slips into a religious one, until the two seemed unseparated. This silences voices that should be heard and we should resist that. Today, students know that by criticizing Israel they take the risk of being falsely accused of anti-Semitism. I am an Israeli Jewish student and I criticize my government; would you call me anti-Semitic? I have spent 22 years there, all my beloved ones are there, together with my past and probably my future. But those years have brought me, like other editorial contributors, to be “silent no longer.” Unlike them, however, I say silence no more to the occupation.
When you spend years in Israel you have two choices: seeing the occupation or closing your eyes in front of it. Twenty-two years were absolutely enough for me to see that we live under a system that discriminates between people based on their national identity. Twenty-two years were enough to see houses in the West Bank and East Jerusalem being demolished by Israel in front of their Palestinians owners’ eyes. It was enough to see the Israeli settlers’ freedom of movement in stark contrast to the harsh restrictions on Palestinians’ movement, it was enough to see the deprivation of water, the arrests of children and the bombings on Gaza. Twenty-two years on this land were enough, and are definitely too long, to say silence no more to the occupation.
We should all remain silent no more in the face of those who wish to prevent freedom of speech on our campus as well. Falsely accusing students who take political stands of anti-Semitism hurts our fundamental right to speak. I chose to participate in a student panel held at the beginning of the week, because of my political beliefs, because as an Israeli and as a human being I resist the occupation and support human rights. In the panel, I was asked whether I am afraid to voice my political opinions in this campus. More than anything else, the silence of voices is what we should all be afraid of, if not terrified of.
We should all say: silence no more. During the last week, Harvard students said it loudly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to the philosopher Roger Scruton, conservatism is the defense of that which one loves. Such things include family, beauty, moral order, individual liberty; the rule of law, freedom of speech, religious practice, the nation state. Of course, several aspects of these institutions have not been worth defending: those steeped in racism, sexism, or the subordination of any other group. But for Scruton, a true conservatism seeks to adapt in order to preserve; it addresses the flaws of the present while remaining skeptical of those who seek to tear its foundations to pieces.
This definition got me thinking: What, if anything, do I love enough to preserve at all costs? What, if anything, do I believe my society would be helpless without? It strikes me as strange that I have never attempted to answer this before. I have always been so confident in the Pinkerian view of human progress — where Enlightenment-style reason is our final triumph over tribalism — that I have not often paused to reckon with the fact that we are always at the potential endpoint of history.
A few weeks ago, Arthur C. Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, wrote a piece arguing that civil discourse is headed down a dangerous path; we are more polarized, less patient, and quicker to assume bad intentions. We speak in order to signal rather than speaking in order to connect. We claim to be able to see inside people’s souls and are surrounded by distractions that keep us from staring into our own.
Social media is the clearest example of this trend. It is manufactured to exploit our worst capacities, encourage outrage and misinformation over nuanced debate, and dramatically reduce face to face interaction. It is difficult to call somebody evil if they are sitting in front of you. It is far easier to do so if a set of followers is waiting to applaud you.
Why do I mention all of this in a piece about conservatism? Because the ability to disagree is exactly what I am most scared of losing.
Disagreement anchors every freedom I value today. It is the ability to think out loud; to be wrong and learn from it; to engage in a conversation and find out what I believe in the process.
Family is worth protecting because it forces us to love in spite of difference. Political parties take turns so that no government has a blank check to do what it likes. Disagreement makes us certain of what we do know and reveals to us what we don’t know. It demonstrates the radical contingency of our beliefs and encourages us to adapt when events alter their validity.
Unity of opinion is simply not an ideal worth striving for. Even the thought of a society in which everyone shared my beliefs makes me queasy. Not only would it be intensely boring, but it would make the obvious mistake of assuming that it could do no wrong. It would foster a lack of gratitude, a lack of humility, and a lack of responsibility — an obliviousness to the fact our generation is one Jenga block at the top of a mountain.
In order to change a mind, one has to reach a heart. That sounds like a cliché, but it is absolutely true. Moral psychology has made it clear that people are far more likely to question their beliefs when they are approached with compassion. It is far easier to be persuaded by someone you love than someone you hate.
To the extent that I am a conservative, I want to conserve conversation; if we lose respectful disagreement, we lose the foundation of our freedom. Relationships, not the government, are the foundation of respect. Democracy cannot function if we do not engage with the strongest versions of each other’s arguments.
Scruton’s conservatism is a warning against complacency; a reminder that if one wishes to tear apart the foundations of a society — be they moral, social, economic, or cultural — one ought to be aware of how such an attempt could go wrong and what could be lost in the process.
Without a sense of the past, it is all too easy to place false confidence in the future. Steven Pinker, Hans Rosling, and other liberal optimists all make excellent points about the underreported victories across history. But progress is not linear — the tremendous advances we have made should not fool us into thinking that the future invites a blindfold.
There is no doubt that social media companies need serious reform (I doubt that Mark Zuckerberg understood the magnitude of his creation in Kirkland House 15 years ago). But on an individual level, there is much that can be done. For my part, I will continue to do everything I can to disagree better.
I can think more carefully before I comment and question myself before I dismiss an opinion. I can better familiarize myself with the views of our professors and take courses that will offer me a variety of perspectives. I can make sure that my Twitter feed covers more of the political, geographical and identity spectra — not because I endorse everybody’s beliefs, but because I want to learn what people truly believe.
Most importantly, I can make it my duty to engage in difficult conversations — conversations that demand good faith and complete transparency. Not in order to take the moral high ground, but to treat those around me with mindfulness and humanity. To see flawed human beings as flawed human beings and conserve disagreement, the practice that I value most of all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council has recently found itself in no shortage of controversy, as its members have debated whether to fund and endorse a number of contentious issues. Last week, the UC voted to allocate $2,050 to fund “Israeli Apartheid Week” — an international movement to raise awareness of treatment of Palestinians in Israel — hosted by the Palestinian Solidarity Committee on Harvard’s campus. This week, the Council voted to endorse and publicize “Heat Week” — a series of events speaking to climate change and fossil fuel divestment hosted by Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice and Divest Harvard. On the heels of this decision, they also endorsed a petition created by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign.
In voting to fund or endorse an event, members of the UC should continue to engage in thoughtful and meaningful conversation that provides a platform for a wide array of perspectives on complex issues. Internal discussion on weighty matters is not enough, however. By way of ballot referenda, public forums, or other means of sourcing valuable student opinion, the Council should always consider its overriding goal: to represent the student body and its values in its projects.
The UC must strive to make its decisions on whether to fund or endorse initiatives through an objective, fair, and balanced process. At present, it is unclear how these choices reflect the UC’s collective values and sense of purpose. For example, though UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 cited a referendum on divestment from fossil fuels as part of the logic of its endorsement, Huesa noted that the legislation is meant to promote dialogue. While there need not be a contradiction here, we call on the Council to clarify whether it funds events as political endorsements or in its capacity as an organization charged with promoting dialogue.
This is not to say that UC-funded or endorsed events should avoid politics altogether. On the contrary, the Council should continue to fund initiatives or movements on campus that speak to a variety of ideologies. For many of these groups, the UC may be its only means of securing funding. However, events that are chosen for funding should be rooted in the goal of sparking meaningful and constructive dialogue within our student body. Initiatives that aim to simply provoke or espouse hateful beliefs toward any members of our community should not be supported through the UC platform merely for the sake of offering different perspectives on campus.
To the extent that the UC might make decisions on political bases, the tone and content of its elections should reflect that aspect of its members’ role. If elected representatives endorse or fund certain events as a result of these ideologies, the student body should have the right to consider this aspect during the election season.
Politics aside, we hope to continue seeing members of the UC involved in comprehensive dialogue before deciding to endorse or fund an initiative. To truly be representative of the student body, it must strive to consider each project fully before casting a final vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Office of the Provost has created a new task force on managing student mental health that plans to evaluate and respond to an increase of reported mental health issues on campus, the University announced Tuesday.
The task force — which consists of more than 40 social science and medical experts; undergraduate and graduate students; graduate student union members; and administrators — will assess how social, academic, and institutional problems at Harvard can influence student mental health. They will also examine various methods of care for mental health issues.
This announcement comes at a time when Harvard’s mental health services continue to face long wait times and understaffing. Despite new hiring, Counseling and Mental Health Services’ staff, which consists of 50 mental health professionals, are often overwhelmed by the number of students seeking to book appointments.
Harvard received a failing grade in a study about Ivy League colleges’ leave of absence policies that critiqued protocols mandating a minimum length for leaves and setting a strict deadline for applications to return.
Sociology Professor Mario L. Small, who is heading the task force, said the group’s diversity of professional backgrounds and identities will aid them as they gather data and formulate final conclusions and recommendations
“We're going to be deploying the skills of all of these people to try to see what we can do about this,” Small said.
Small said the task force comprises two working groups centered on both undergraduate and graduate students. Psychology Professor Matthew K. Nock chairs the undergraduate working group, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench chairs the graduate and professional school working group.
Small said the task force will work with data collected from surveys from previous years as well as interviews and focus groups with students, faculty, and staff about these issues.
Both Nock and Dench noted that the working groups — one of which met for the first time in March — have seen “extraordinarily good attendance.”
“In all the meeting so far, it's been striking how invested our whole community is in this issue,” Dench said.
Dench also noted that the graduate student working groups will concentrate in “a very urgent and focused way” on gathering more data, especially for students outside of GSAS.
In a HUHS survey released in November, graduate students in four Faculty of Arts and Sciences programs reported rates of depression as high as 31 percent, more than six times the national average. Harvard Law School students filled out a similar survey at the time, but the results of the survey have yet to be released. Last Thursday, Law School students hung posters during admitted students weekend calling on administrators to release all of the findings of the survey.
Small said the task force intends to publish a report available to the entire University about trends in data collected as well as methods for outreach.
“The idea is to make this report open to the public,” Small said. “And the more people are thinking about these issues, the more people know what we've been doing.”
Nock said the task force also hopes to address the stigma surrounding mental health issues on university campuses.
“The more students are aware of what the rates of these things are and the more the faculty are aware of what the rates of these things are, the better prepared we are to address these things and take action,” Nock said.

Harvard will train its athletics coaching staff on its conflict of interest policy in the wake of an investigation into head fencing coach Peter Brand for engaging in a real estate transaction with the parent of a current and then-prospective fencer.
The planned training, first covered by the Boston Globe Saturday, comes after the Globe reported Thursday that Brand sold his home in Needham, Mass. to iTalk Global Communications, Inc. co-founder Jie Zhao in 2016 for approximately $300,000 above its market valuation. Zhao’s younger son was admitted to the College shortly thereafter to fence for Harvard. Zhao’s older son, who was already on Harvard’s fencing team, graduated in 2018.
Zhao told the Globe that the purchase was not meant to help his son gain admission.
The University’s conflict of interest policy, published on the Harvard Information for Employees website, states that those who violate the policy could face disciplinary action as serious as termination.
“A conflict of interest exists when individual commitment to the University may be compromised by personal benefit. Employees are expected to avoid situations or activities that could interfere with their unencumbered exercise of judgment in the best interests of Harvard University,” the policy reads.
“Failure to disclose possible conflict of interest or commitment or refusal to cease activities that are determined to be in conflict with the University's best interests may be grounds for disciplinary action and may lead to termination,” the policy adds.
Head Varsity Squash Coach Mike Way wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday that his office has not heard anything about the conflict of interest training yet. Three other varsity coaches declined to comment on past conflict of interest training.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email Thursday to FAS affiliates that Harvard had commissioned an “independent review” of the transactions between Brand and Zhao.
Brand is still listed as the head coach of the men’s and women’s fencing programs on GoCrimson.com, the official website of Harvard Athletics.
Zhao first became friends with Brand during his older son’s freshmen year of college, according to the Globe. Zhao’s sons had trained at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in high school under the direction of Alexander Ryjik. Ryjik’s son also fenced at Harvard under Brand and graduated in 2015.
Gay stressed in her email that Harvard’s admissions practices are rigorous and different from other institutions in that all applications are reviewed by a full committee of approximately 40 members. She also wrote that all recruited student-athletes receive interviews by admissions officers or alumni interviewers.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said in an interview March 28 that though coaches can recommend applicants to the admissions office, the admissions committee makes its decisions separately.
“What we have is a situation where the coaches recommend to the admissions office the people that they feel are the best candidates to both help the team and to be a part of our Harvard community. But it's the admissions office that actually admits them,” Scalise said. “It's a little bit more of a safeguard. I mean when we talk about admissions in athletics, we don't really talk about slots or spots.”
The official website of the Ivy League, an intercollegiate athletic conference that includes Harvard, states that Ivy League coaches can advise applicants through the college admissions process.
“Ivy League coaches are knowledgeable about admissions policies, can be valuable resources in guiding prospects through the application process, and may offer advice and counsel based on feedback from admissions,” the website reads.
Coaches are then able to relay their support to the admissions office.
“Coaches may communicate to the Admissions Office their support for candidates who are athletic recruits,” the website adds.
The investigation into Brand comes at a time when the admissions processes of top universities are under intense scrutiny, specifically in the wake of the nationwide “Operation Varsity Blues” college admissions scandal and the affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard filed by Students for Fair Admissions last year.
Thirty-three parents were charged in the scandal. Several of them are accused of bribing coaches at various elite colleges across the country to list their children as recruited athletes to give them a leg up in the admissions process. These schools included Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California, but no Harvard coaches were implicated.

The Cambridge City Council Housing Committee discussed the Affordable Housing Overlay proposal at their Tuesday meeting, the latest step in an ongoing process to create more affordable housing in the city.
The proposed zoning reform would offer affordable developers incentives to build residential units, allowing them to successfully compete with market-rate developers. The proposal would also amend zoning regulations to streamline approval processes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency for new affordable housing construction.
At the meeting, city officials from the Community Development Department addressed questions and concerns from the Housing Committee. In addition to the five members who sit on the committee, every member of City Council attended the meeting.
During the meeting, several councilors raised concerns about the project, including various technical aspects such as height restrictions on buildings and potential legal challenges. Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, a former architect and urban design consultant, questioned the City’s ability to address urban design challenges including cost management and building capacity, calling it “the big question mark.”
“I think we're avoiding the big issue, and I want this to succeed like all my fellow councilors, and we will make it succeed,” he said. “It seems we're not ready and just accept that and let's get the work done.”
Other councilors focused the potential environmental impact of such a project. Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said he is concerned about a negative “tradeoff” between lower-cost housing and more environmentally friendly building standards.
Zondervan specifically cited the tree protection legislation passed by the City Council in February that has halted the issuance of tree-cutting permits for one year. Trees on properties considered to be affordable housing, however, are exempt from this protection.
“We need housing, and we also need to mitigate against climate change,” he said. “This could be an opportunity to achieve both.”
Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, co-chair of the Housing Committee, reiterated the importance of ongoing dialogue between the Council and Cambridge residents to ensure the overlay proposal proceeds with “clarity.”
“The ability to work on something and play around with it conceptually will help this committee,” she said.
While the meeting did not allow public comment, over a dozen members of the public attended. Cambridge resident David E. Sullivan said he attended because he supports the proposal, and wanted to hear the councilors’ concerns.
“It affects me in the sense that I care about the diversity of our city, and I want it to continue to be a place where you don't have to be rich to live here,” he said.
The city will hold a public hearing on April 16, during which Cambridge residents can share their opinions on the Affordable Housing Overlay. The Housing Committee will continue its discussion on zoning reform in the following meeting, scheduled for April 25.
Mayor Marc C. McGovern urged the Council to continue its dialogue without giving way to negative criticism.
“I don't want us to be ruled by fear of backlash,” he said. “I want the best project, the best ordinance we can get, and I'm open to anything that achieves what it is we're saying that this is about.”
Correction: April 14, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the House Committee includes every member of the City Council. In fact, only five City Council members sit on the committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lawyer representing Winthrop House tutors Carl L. Miller and Valencia Miller wrote in a Tuesday letter to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana that the Millers plan to file a Title IX complaint about their confrontation with College student Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20 in the Winthrop dining hall last Wednesday.
The Millers’ lawyer, George J. Leontire, alleges in the letter that Mudannayake “harassed” them during the Wednesday incident; Mudannayake has stated that Carl Miller harassed her. Leontire also copied University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay on the letter.
Mudannayake, Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe, and several student groups also distributed emails, letters, and blog posts in response to the incident, which concluded with both Mudannayake and Carl Miller filing conflicting reports referencing each other with Harvard police.
Mudannayake said she approached Miller last Wednesday evening after she believed he may have taken photos and videos of her while she ate dinner with a friend. The Millers offered a different account — both wrote in emails that Mudannayake harassed and provoked them and their family while they ate. Valencia Miller wrote that they were taking photos of their child who was with them.
Leontire wrote in the letter that the Millers plan to file the Title IX complaint with the University in response to their interactions with Mudannayake. Title IX is a federal law that guides the University's approach to handling incidents of gender and sex-based misconduct and discrimination.
Mudannayake, an Eliot House resident and Crimson design editor, said in an interview Tuesday that she has not been informed of any Title IX complaint filed by the Millers.
Harvard spokespeople could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday night.
Mudannayake also circulated a Medium post titled “i will not be silenced” over the Eliot email list Tuesday. In the post, she repeated her allegations that Carl Miller photographed her multiple times from across the Winthrop dining hall as she ate dinner with a friend last Wednesday.
Mudannayake has made international headlines for her activism regarding Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as he stands accused of rape. In Facebook posts and at protests, she has previously called for Sullivan to step down from his post as faculty dean.
The Wednesday night incident last week was not the first time Carl Miller and Mudannayake allegedly interacted. On Feb. 25, Mudannayake and a group of other students distributed flyers calling for Sullivan’s removal in Winthrop. She wrote in her Medium post that Carl Miller followed her around the House that morning as she passed out the flyers.
“The night that myself and 4 other students distributed fliers in Winthrop House, Dean Sullivan’s Senior Tutor, Carl Miller, proceeded to follow me around the entirety of Winthrop despite the fact that I was well within my rights of free speech to distribute my fliers,” she wrote.
Mudannayake also wrote that Sullivan has used “methods of intimidation” against her and disputed his comments that she and College administrators have acted in a racially-biased manner against him in response to his choice to represent Weinstein. The College launched a “climate review” of Winthrop after student backlash to Sullivan’s decision.
“I, a 21 year-old college undergraduate being targeted by tutors who are much older than me and a Dean who is one of the foremost defense lawyers in the country,” she wrote. “As a brown international woman at Harvard I believe that the narrative put forth by Dean Sullivan and the Millers, accusing any and all critics of being racially motivated, is a detriment to those who are truly suffering from racially motivated attacks.”
Dean O’Keefe sent an email to Eliot affiliates Tuesday criticizing the Millers’ decision to file a police report against Mudannayake.
“The two Winthrop tutors acted totally unprofessionally and dishonestly,” O’Keefe wrote. “Here at Eliot we would never condone nor allow tutors to make a public attack on an undergraduate, let alone in such a blatant and clumsy political way.”
Leontire criticized O’Keefe’s statement in his letter, calling her comments “inappropriate.”
Three campus groups — anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better, the Association of Black Harvard Women, and the Harvard Student Labor Action Movement — also distributed a letter over several House-wide email lists Tuesday criticizing the Millers’ version of events.
“This response is a blatant attempt to intimidate student activists broadly and especially Mudannayake herself,” their statement reads. “We support Mudannayake’s right to free speech and commend her moral courage in speaking out against rape culture on campus in the face of intimidation, harassment, and threats.”
The groups also reaffirmed their previous calls for Sullivan to step down, arguing that the dual police reports are a “distraction” from his decision to represent Weinstein.
“Students deserve better from the leaders of their house communities,” they wrote.
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment on Mudannayake’s statement, O’Keefe’s email, and the student groups’ letter.
Correction: April 10, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Danu Mudannayake, Gail O'Keefe, and several student groups distributed emails, letters, and blog posts in response to the incident on the same day. In fact, O'Keefe sent her email a day earlier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Activists and experts discussed the intersection of racism, xenophobia, and mass incarceration at a panel in Emerson Hall Tuesday.
The panel featured Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74, American History fellow Kristina Shull, criminal justice reform activists Arthur Bembury and Douglas Rogers, and Orlando Lopez, a Latin American undocumented immigrant who was previously detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Five Harvard College student groups sponsored the event: Act on a Dream, Black Men’s Forum, Latino Men’s Collective, Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Advocacy, and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign.
During the panel, Lopez recounted his experience with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said he moved to the United States after multiple family members passed away in a six-month period. While being detained, he said he feared that he would be permanently separated from his infant son.
Other panelists linked mass incarceration to a history of white colonization.
“The rise of the prison system rests within histories of slavery and Jim Crow segregation and Native American removal and erasure,” Shull said.
Bembury and Rogers, both of whom were formerly incarcerated, encouraged attendees to volunteer with criminal justice reform organizations.
“Criminal justice reform is a new civil rights movement. We’re soldiers in the trenches. We need you with us,” Bembury, who directs a mentorship program for inmates seeking college degrees, said. “Lend your voices, lend your connections, lend your resources.”
Rogers, the founder of an organization that focuses on the experiences of BGLTQ+ individuals in the prison industrial complex, encouraged attendees to send letters to incarcerated individuals through his organization’s pen-pal program.
“I stood up to a prison guard who assaulted me, and I watched him try to assault another individual, and I didn’t let that happen. So they put me in solitary confinement for one year. The only thing I received of human touch was my mail,” he said.
West said that to enact change, individuals must “go against the grain.”
“I think we at Harvard can rededicate ourselves to Veritas. The condition of truth is to allow suffering to speak. When you listen closely to the voices of the suffering, it’s an invitation to care,” West said.
At the end of the panel, student members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign briefly discussed their work on campus and their confrontation last week with University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Protesters calling on the University to divest its nearly $40 billion endowment from companies tied to prisons interrupted a talk by Bacow Thursday eventually leading to him and other speakers relocating to a different room.
Bacow said in an interview immediately after the talk the protester's behavior does not "encourage" him to meet with them again.
Bacow has previously given several reasons as to why the University stands by its longstanding precedent of refusing to use its endowment to achieve for political ends. The University previously divested from the tobacco industry in 1990, as well as from companies in South Africa in 1986. Bacow has called these incidents rare exceptions to University policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School announced a new online public leadership credential program Thursday, joining the trend of Harvard schools expanding their online academic offerings.
Anyone with a bachelor’s degree, a minimum of five years of professional work experience, and proficiency in English is eligible to register for the certificate program. The flexible program is geared toward individuals with commitments that would prevent them from relocating to Cambridge for a traditional Kennedy School degree.
“Through the Public Leadership Credential, we will extend the benefits of Harvard Kennedy School knowledge and training to a wider group of individuals currently working to advance the public good,” Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in a press release about the program. “The PLC program will provide participants with tools and insights to improve the lives of people in their communities, cities, and countries.”
The program offers six courses that are each six weeks in length. Students can choose to take any number of courses, but all six are required to earn the Public Leadership Credential.
Program co-leader Christopher Robichaud said the program offers people interested in intervening in the current state of world politics to do so without having to take time off their jobs to be trained in person.
“There’s kind of a crisis of leadership going on,” Robichaud said. “There’s a whole wide range of individuals out there who want to respond to this crisis of leadership, who want to genuinely engage in the world with a set of skills for public service, who can’t take a year off from their jobs or family commitments to come to Cambridge to study.”
“The idea is anyone can take any of these six courses and have a great learning experience. For the ambitious who want to take all six, there will then be an opportunity for a final capstone essay evaluation,” Robichaud added.
The courses are split into three branches that focus on different skill sets in public policy and leadership. Each branch was designed in collaboration with a Harvard Kennedy School faculty member. Robichaud said he has been personally involved in building courses on leadership and ethics.
“Course A is a six-week course, and it focuses mostly on the individual working their way in an organization, learning a little bit about their own values and principles, and how to engage in a kind of practice of effective leadership,” Robichaud said.
Course B, the second part of the leadership and ethics set, focuses on behavioral sciences and theory, according to Robichaud.
In addition to the leadership and ethics branch, courses will be offered in the subject of evidence for decisions, led by Lecturer in Public Policy Theodore Svoronos, and policy design and delivery, led by Senior Lecturer in Public Policy Michael Walton.
Robichaud said that he and the other faculty developing the program said they are still in the process of deciding what a capstone assessment might entail for those seeking a certificate.
The Kennedy School is not alone in developing its online options. Harvard Business School recently rebranded its online iteration — HBS Online — and has seen a spike in applications and website traffic. The Business School has also expanded the number of courses available to participants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge continues to experience the marvels of spring, Harvard softball came home to host the top seeded team in the Ivy League conference, the Columbia Lions. After a dominating game one performance and a narrow game two loss, the Crimson went 9-1 in game three to secure this weekend’s series.
“Columbia was a huge matchup,” sophomore infielder Morgan Melito said. “They are a very quality team and it was a great weekend to compete with them and come out with a series win”
HARVARD 14, COLUMBIA 1
The Crimson had a dominant performance in the first game against their Ivy League rivals. After giving up a run early in the first inning, Harvard answered back with three of its own.
After a scoreless second inning and a single Harvard run in the third, the Crimson turned on the boosters and proceeded to showcase complete dominance with a single inning total of 10 runs.
The run streak began with a base walk, with all the bases loaded, which allowed freshman catcher Megan Welsh to score. After that, the runs kept on piling up with multiple Harvard players getting in on the scoring action, including senior infielder Rhianna Rich, who was the last Crimson to score, bringing the total runs to fourteen.
“We had a very definitive game plan against them’” senior catcher Elizabeth Shively said. “To be offensive and really be on the attack. The plan was to swing early on the count and good pitches, which we executed.”
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 10 
Following their blowout victory in game one, the Crimson fell to the Lions in a very close game two. The Lions came out roaring right from the gate with a total of 10 runs in the first two innings.
Harvard tried to overcome that deficit and came very close when Welsh scored, cutting Columbia’s lead to one. However, that was not enough with the Lions wrapping up the final inning with their single point lead maintained, giving them the game two victory.
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 1
Both teams headed into game three with the series tied at 1-1, with the Crimson pulling out ahead early in the match to take a 4-0 lead after the first inning, thanks to a three-run hammer from Melito.
“We were gonna approach the next game relentlessly,” said Shively. “We were gonna stick to our plan and continue that attack mindset.”
The Lions answered back with a run, but that was all they could do before the Crimson ran away with the game, ultimately gaining 9 runs and the series victory.
“Everyone did their job well”, said Melito. Everyone had a role in those two games and our pitching staff shut them down. The biggest thing was getting all the moving parts together and that is what we have been working on this season.
This weekend’s victory also gave head coach Jenny Allard her 300th Ivy League win, the most of any Ivy League softball coach. This comes just a year after netting her 600th career win in a game against the Columbia Lions.
“[Coach Allard] is definitely the heartbeat of our team,” said Melito. “As the leader of this program she definitely sets the Harvard softball league culture. She’s been here for 20+ years and her leadership has ingrained the team with so many values that set the tone [for the softball program].”
Harvard faces Boston College this tuesday before traveling to Hanover, N.H. this weekend to face Dartmouth in a three game series, which has major Ivy League implications.
“We took this series as a turning point for our team,” said Melito. “Coming together as a team and that is only going to prepare us for our opponent this weekend, Dartmouth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday evening, Harvard men's basketball honored its six outgoing seniors and announced its captains for the upcoming 2019-2020 campaign. Junior forwards Seth Towns and Henry Welsh were voted to lead the Crimson, taking the reins from current seniors Weisner Perez and Corey Johnson.
Towns, the Ivy League Player of the Year in his sophomore year, missed the entire 2018-19 season rehabbing from a knee injury. Holding career scoring averages of 14.2 points per game in 44 starts, the Columbus, Ohio native was given an AP All-America honorable mention at the conclusion of his second season, just the fourth-player in program history to earn the distinction.
Welsh made four starts in his junior season, highlighted by a career-high, 15-point performance against Saint Mary's on Nov. 24. That outing also gave him COOP Athlete of the Week honors. Averaging 12.2 minutes per game this season, the Loyola graduate has shot just shy of 48 percent from the field in his career. Welsh has also been recognized off the court through being named to the CoSIDA Academic All-District first team.
The Raymond P. Lavietes '36 Most Valuable Player Award was given to junior guard Bryce Aiken. The unanimous all-Ivy first team player finished the season tallying 22.2 PPG, the third-highest average in program history. Aiken recently added his name into consideration for the 2019 NBA Draft, while still preserving his collegiate eligibility. The Randolph, N.J. native also claimed the Henry Zimmerman Free Throw Accuracy Award, leading the team with a 85.5 percent clip from the charity stripe.
Junior guard Justin Bassey was given Defensive Player of the Year Award honors for the second-straight season, while freshmen Mason Forbes and Kale Catchings shared the Hamilton Fish '10 Most Improved Player Award. Captain Weisner Perez was recognized with the John Harnice '84 Spirit Award. Junior guard Christian Juzang took home the Thomas G. Stemberg '71, MBA '73 Iron Man Award for most minutes played in the season, and senior Robbie Feinberg was honored with the Academic Excellence Award. The Floyd S. Wilson Sportsmanship Award was given to sophomore Danilo Djuricic.
The Crimson closes the books on its 2018-19 season with its second-straight Ivy League championship and seventh in nine seasons. Its victory over Georgetown in the opening round of the NIT also gave the program its first-ever win in that tournament. Harvard returns nearly all of its scoring in addition to an incoming class highlighted by Massachusetts Gatorade Player of the Year Chris Ledlum, as it seeks a return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015.

It’s 12:45 a.m., you have a quiz tomorrow, and all of your belongings are in your room. So is your roommate … and their significant other. Maybe this is the first encounter in a budding romance or maybe it’s a repeated affair. But you need to plug in your laptop and get some sleep. If you are standing at the door and pondering what to do, Flyby has some advice.
Text your roommate
This should always be the first step. Shoot a quick, “Let me know when I can come in” to signal that you’re a privacy-respecting, romance-supporting roommate, but that you are waiting at the door and please get the hell out. If they agree to let you know and you’re still waiting after a while, be honest and let them know that you really need to sleep. Hopefully your roommate has their ringer on, and this tactic will get the job done quickly and cleanly.
Knock on the door passive aggressively
As any proctor will tell you during opening days, passive aggression is the number one way to resolve roommate conflicts. This method is sure to induce some panicked shuffling, cries of “one second!,” and an avoidance of eye contact as you walk in. While the passive aggressive knock is efficient, it is low-impact. While mildly embarrassed, your roommate is unlikely to change their behavior in response to a meager knock. If you want your message to be received loud and clear, try our next tip.
Feign ignorance and just walk in
This tactic isn’t for the faint of heart, but sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do. Take a deep breath, muster your courage, and strut confidently on in. It is key to act surprised and apologetic when you catch them in the act, but that awkward look you’ll exchange is sure to kill the mood immediately. Additional benefits of this strategy include planting seeds of paranoia in your roommate going forward, and hopefully nudging them to do it in their partner’s room next time. If risking seeing something you don’t want to see isn’t worth it to you, move on to the next strategy.
Get your proctor
JUST KIDDING. Do not get your proctor.
Of course, open communication, honesty, and compromise are always viable tactics. But let’s be honest: What fun is that?
