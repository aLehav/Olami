After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For just under 400 pages, Guillermo Erades’s debut novel, “Back to Moscow,” situates the reader within the mind of a blithely misogynistic narrator. Martin, a foreign Ph.D. student at Moscow State University, studies women in Russian literature. In a twist of  “academic creativity,” he attempts to construct a sociological, field work-based understanding of “real Russian women.” In other words, Martin turns academia into an excuse to meet, sleep with, and occasionally have protracted relationships with these so-called “real Russian women.” The trials and tribulations of these relationships form the entirety of Erades’s plot. However, our narrator’s abandonment of traditional academia becomes something both more interesting and more disturbing than a simple skirting of responsibility.
The most fascinating facet of Erades’s text is not Martin’s explicit philosophical musing themselves but rather what is implicitly revealed through them. Erades rather brilliantly uses Martin’s search for the soul of the “real Russian woman” to highlight the hubristic sexism of such an attempt. By focusing on Martin’s female-oriented perspective, Erades is able to note the twinges of misogyny embedded in his straight male perspective. However, while the novel cleverly plays with perspective to highlight the assumptions inherent to Martin’s actions, Erades’ writing barely portrays women as individuals any more than Martin does in his own limited view. This is where the novel becomes most problematic: Martin interprets the women of his world in a hyper-misogynistic manner, but the underlying truth is only slightly more rich than Martin assumes it to be.
The foundation of the novel is strong. Martin is a compelling narrator because he is able to perceive the physical factual realities of emotion in women while remaining unable to effectively interpret them as evidence of inner psychological states. To Martin, women are not people but rather a series of incomprehensible actions. In the following scene, this theme is carried out to its entirety: Here, his girlfriend finds her contact information in his phone as “Lena [her first name] Propaganda [the club they met in].” Martin says, “‘Is it my fault that so many girls in Moscow share the same few names? It’s all Katyas, Mashas, Lenas, Tanyas, Olyas, Natashas.’ She looked at me, now on the verge of tears. Then, in a shaky, soft voice she said, ‘I just want to be Lena.’” Lena is hurt by his refusal to consider her as an individual—or indeed as anything other than a woman he met in a club (like all the rest of the “Lenas”) that he sleeps with. Martin completely misses this, responding to her desire for acknowledgement by quite literally equating her with every other girl living in Moscow. Martin observes her being “on the verge of tears” and speaking with “a shaky, soft voice”; however, Martin’s keen eye for physicality renders no understanding of the psychological narrative within Lena. She is correct: Martin does not consider her an individual.
Passages like these, in which Erades’ omission of information reveals a subtle depth to Martin’s character, form the foundation for the novel’s effective use of first person narrative. Here, the nature of a first person perspective allows Erades to highlight the way in which misogyny constitutes not only external interactions but also a flawed internal narrative. Martin would not be caught doing something externally sexist—he is not portrayed as overlooking a female character for a promotion or being an agent of the wage gap. Instead, by situating Martin’s misogyny within his internal narrative, Erades astutely implies that sexism consists not simply of a series of physical actions but also of a flawed internal perspective.
However, a myriad of minor issues in the narrative undermine the subtle feminism implied by an analysis of Martin’s character. Erades’ plotting feels thin. The novel’s ending feels unsupported, rushed, and indelicately treated. But these are all minor problems compared to the deeply problematic manner in which the text conceives of its female characters. In Erades’ world, all women want to be taken out to expensive, champagne-accompanied dinners bookended by bouquets of roses and the magic words “I love you.” In a particularly amusing recurring sequence of scenes, all women, after a night of sex, seem to want to brush their teeth with the same red toothbrush—abstaining from the four less brightly colored (and clean) toothbrushes Martin leaves by his sink. If they do not want dinners and red toothbrushes, they are emotionally unfeeling and philosophically empty. If the text treated its female characters with the same eye for subtle commentary as Martin’s character shows Erades has the creative potential to do, “Back to Moscow” would have been a masterful text. Instead, Erades ironically creates a work that Martin’s character successfully parodies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much ink has been spilled about the recently announced sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, but relatively little has been said by both students and the administration about what will become of the social scene. The administration has promised to “invest in social alternatives and increase its social programming budgets.” It is unclear, however, what the University believes will allow students to “reimagine their social options while reinforcing community values of inclusion.” The pledge to increase funding for the social scene is praiseworthy, but it must be done wisely if the College hopes to truly accomplish its missions of safety and inclusivity. Rather than focusing on efforts to create a social scene from the top down, the administration should give students the resources and the freedom to create an inclusive alternative to final clubs.
In her letter accepting the recommendations of College Dean Rakesh Khurana, University President Drew G. Faust criticized single gender organizations for “enacting forms of privilege and exclusion.” This sentiment was echoed by Elm Yard Resident Dean Jasmine M. Waddell in an interview, who defined “safety and inclusivity” as worthy goals for social spaces and pointed out issues related to dangerous drinking and the unsafe behavior resulting from drinking. Although safety and inclusivity are necessary goals, the College has pursued them while simultaneously limiting on-campus spaces available to students. For example, the College has chosen to replace in-suite common rooms with public ones throughout the more than $1 billion House renewal project.
While such moves appear to address safety and inclusivity, they have served instead to increase the popularity of unrecognized social clubs. These organizations provide a physical location for students to socialize free of administrative oversight, at a time when administrative oversight is quite extensive. If the administration truly wants to reimagine social life on campus, it will have to recognize that its negative pressure on unrecognized groups alone cannot remake Harvard’s social scene. Students must have real alternatives to their current options.
Therefore, we propose two measures to compete with off-campus social life and improve Harvard’s general social scene. First, to satisfy students desire to socialize within their tightly-knit groups, Harvard should invest in and bolster the House Committees to facilitate social life within the House. This first step is straightforward: increase the HoCo budgets so that House events are as well-furnished as possible. The quality of social events should not suffer due to a lack of resources if the administration truly wants to compete with exclusive, off-campus spaces. Second, College administrators should streamline the party-throwing process for upperclassmen and freshmen as much as possible so that students can socialize with each other within the comfort and privacy of their own dorm rooms. In the event that students don’t have the space to do so, common rooms should be available for student use, just as they are for student organizations. Finally, as it undertakes future renovations, the administrations should be aware of the aforementioned points and strive to maintain in-suite common rooms. If already existing space is being used as efficiently and effectively as possible and more House common space is truly needed, then it should be private enough for students to host their own events.
Giving students the ability to create social spaces comes with the responsibility to make those spaces as safe as possible, and the administration should ensure that students have the tools and training to meet that obligation. In the process of streamlining the party training process, the administration should incentivize training, just as the existing “fast-track” program is only available to those who have completed sexual assault and alcohol training.
Moreover, in order to address the desire for regular socialization beyond one’s usual social circle, the administration along with the Undergraduate Council should centralize inclusive social events. A social scene driven by student organizations that throw events all by themselves—often at the same time—splits the student body and makes off-campus social life seem more popular by comparison. Instead, student organizations and the UC should regularly aim to throw a single open and inclusive party—perhaps on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. Students and student organizations would, of course, host private events on the same evening, but in order for this alternative to compete with off-campus social life it needs to be consistently well-attended. If funding such events is an issue even with the promised increased investment, the organizers could charge admission. In order to maintain inclusivity, a Student Events Fund-eligible “semester pass” to all events should be available. While this proposal may appear to contradict the goal of student empowerment, an effective and regular partnership between students and the administration will pool resources and create events for the whole community.
Finally, no discussion about social life is complete without a frank consideration of the role of alcohol. Although alcohol often serves as a social currency and incentive for events, the legal drinking age limits what Harvard can do. Harvard can, however, acknowledge this incentive, give greater flexibility to students organizations, and serve alcohol at larger events. We are not arguing that the administration should ignore the law; we do hope that it will try to expand its tolerance of on-campus drinking. The amnesty policy, for example, serves the important role of allowing students to address unsafe drinking, but the administration must also create opportunities for and incentivize safe drinking by being more flexible with alcohol on campus.
The administration must be careful in its desire to provide a safe and inclusive alternative to off-campus social life, lest it be seen as just that, an uncool, University-sanctioned alternative. Ultimately, administrators should strive to give students the freedom and resources to create their own competitive alternative and incentivize them to do so responsibly.

Dear readers,
We at The Harvard Crimson have received a number of questions regarding the sanctions introduced by Harvard College earlier this month that ban undergraduate members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding athletic team captaincies and leadership positions in all recognized student groups. We want to make it clear that this policy is not applicable to The Crimson.
The Crimson chose many years ago not to be formally recognized by Harvard, and our relationship with the University has not changed: The Crimson has always maintained its editorial and organizational independence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I took a seat at the table, and the new Indiana Secretary of Commerce turned to me. Not realizing I was the mayor-elect he had traveled here to meet, he genially asked a question I had often heard at introductions in the corporate world: “So what’s your role?”
I tried to think of a response that would clear things up but not embarrass him. You couldn’t blame him for not instantly recognizing me; after all, I was not only new but also 29 years old. I said: “the title is mayor-elect, but the role is more of a philosophical question.”

By some turn of organizational American English, the word “role” has become a euphemism for “job title.” Yet there is a deep distinction between roles and titles, and grasping this is especially urgent for a young person leaving the warm embrace of a place like Harvard, who might be en route to a first full-time job title (and a new role).
If you had pulled me aside on Commencement Day, 2004, to ask what title I might like to hold in ten years, the reply would not have been terribly imaginative. “Professor,” I might have said, or “attorney,” or “Congressman.” All worthy titles, of course. But you can bear such positions well or poorly, use them or squander them. My answer would have been shallow because the question is shallow.
But had you asked what I thought my role in life might be, you might have gotten me thinking about the inscription on the gate by Massachusetts Avenue that reads on one side, “ENTER TO GROW IN WISDOM” and on the other, “DEPART TO SERVE BETTER THY COUNTRY AND THY KIND.” Soaked in history, literature, and IOP events, I had grown just enough in wisdom to understand that fulfillment and purpose would come through service to others.
Like many classmates, I was still overly concerned with what titles I would hold one day. Only by eventually relaxing that interest would I find an unlikely and twofold path toward the role that now defines my work: to put ideas into practice, apply my education, and make myself useful to my community and country.
The day of my 10th reunion, I was awoken at about 3 a.m. by a rousing phone call from my old roommates from Leverett House. I was on leave from the mayor’s office for seven months to go on active duty orders, asleep in my quarters at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. I’ve never been happier to get a call in the middle of the night. Over there, my roles included working to help disrupt funding to the Taliban, mentoring enlisted analysts, and ensuring that American personnel in the vehicles I drove or guarded got to their destinations on time and alive. Had you told my 22-year-old self that I would one day hold the title of ATFC LNO to CJIATF-A, I would have been mystified by the military gibberish. But explaining that I would one day be an officer trusted with the lives of soldiers and civilians in a war zone would have motivated me to live up to that call.
Likewise, at 22 I would not have seen “mayor” as a title in my future. To the extent I thought about holding office, I assumed then (naively, and despite a good education) that national politics was where all the important decisions happened. But if you had explained that there would come an opportunity to play a meaningful role in the revitalization of my once-declining hometown, to help shape streets and neighborhoods and lives, I might have heard a calling.
I had no idea that those titles would prove to be the specific vehicles for a longed-for role as an effective public servant—and an exceptionally fulfilling professional life. Nor could I have foreseen the path that brought me here, which included a brief business career and a doomed run for Indiana State Treasurer (a job title I’d never heard of in 2004). That path became possible only once worrying about the next position took a back seat to an expansive sense of what my role could be.
The public servants I most admire from our generation of Harvard graduates have made the kind of choices that deep vocation requires: decisions to go live in an unglamorous place, to pass up more superficially appealing and respectable opportunities, even to risk one’s life for a greater good. They now play compelling roles because they pursued not a position but a disposition.
If you are called to play an impactful and positive role in, say, the relationship between the U.S. and the Muslim world, why fixate on whether your path to that role sees you titled as an activist or novelist, soldier or scholar, cleric or diplomat?
A Harvard degree is a rare and powerful tool to impact and shape your surroundings. It is certainly useful for securing a coveted title. Titles matter, but like a good education, a title is a tool. Your job matters when it lets you contribute to your role—not the other way around.

Peter P.M. Buttigieg ’04 is mayor of South Bend, Ind. A former president of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee and columnist for The Crimson, he lived in Leverett House as an undergraduate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following six years of negotiations and public meetings, the Cambridge City Planning Board approved MIT’s plans for a massive renovation of Kendall Square that aims to revitalize the area and attract more research companies.
MIT’s “East Campus” is slated to be completely remodeled, allowing for additional open space, new academic buildings, more than 100,000 square feet of retail space, and more housing for graduate students and Cambridge residents.
While councillors praised the redevelopment for its vision for Kendall Square and the commercial opportunities it will provide, some said they wished MIT would have gone further in creating affordable housing units for graduate students.
“Overall I think it’s going to be a pretty positive project,” Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said. “Like any project there will be things that maybe could be done better or more like the graduate student housing.”
Affordable housing has recently been a topic of heated discussion at the City Council.
“The obvious shortcoming is that the campus and the city do get a lot of placemaking, but they don’t get a solution for the housing woes and the equity woes that we have had for longer than 20 years,” Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, an MIT graduate, said. “That’s a good start, but it’s not by any means an acceptable ending point.”
MIT’s plan does include provisions for graduate student housing in Kendall Square, as well as a housing  “that will accommodate a mix of incomes and unit sizes.”
Both MIT and Harvard play a significant role in the housing market in Cambridge, Mazen said. Graduate students who are not guaranteed housing often choose to live together in off-campus apartments, driving up the rental price.
“Universities, both Harvard and MIT are always trying to figure out how they can get predictability and cooperability out of the Council,” Mazen said. “The Council is always trying to figure out how we can get a long term plan for equity and access and a reduction in housing pressures.”
Kendall Square, a home to a plethora of biotech, energy and information technology firms, has even inspired Harvard as it plans its growing Allston campus. Harvard’s focus remains across the Charles River  in the Boston neighborhood, as it resumes construction on a $1 billion complex for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences alongside many smaller projects. Following a meeting last March, Cambridge City Councillors and Harvard administrators described the relations between Harvard and Cambridge as amicable.
Discussions of the renovations have been ongoing since 2010. MIT’s original rezoning proposal in 2011 was shot down by the City Council for what they thought was a paucity affordable housing units. In 2013, members of the MIT administration, including MIT President L. Rafael Reif, attended a Cambridge City Council meeting to lobby for a new rezoning proposal, which included provisions for more affordable housing units.
Following the Council’s approval of the petition in 2013, the plan underwent further revisions by the Council and the Planning Board to reach its current state.
“Obviously it seems like it’s been a very long time and it has been a very long time,” McGovern said. “But it is moving ahead.”
This is not the first time social life in Kendall Square has been subject to scrutiny by city officials. In 2011 the Cambridge City Council discussed an appropriation of up to $175,000 to revitalize the area and its nightlife, which councillors claimed “lacks appeal” for tourists, when compared to other city squares. Since then, Kendall Square has seen an increase in the number of restaurants and even a proposal for a skyscraper.
“It really is what you see in a lot of downtown areas,” McGovern said. “When people aren’t there to work everything kind of shuts down, and now it’s transforming into some place that is going to be much more vibrant 24/7.
In an MIT-produced video celebrating the approval of the renovations, Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor David P. Maher and City Manager Richard C. Rossi spoke alongside MIT officials, praising the project.

All 12 of the College’s residential Houses will include gender-neutral bathrooms once the more than $1 billion ongoing House renewal project is complete.
Going forward, each of the renovated Houses will aim to have a gender-neutral bathroom and shower on each floor, according to Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña. Previously renewed Houses Quincy, Leverett, and Dunster already include gender-neutral bathrooms.
In a statement to College students, dela Peña wrote the construction of gender-neutral bathrooms—what she termed “Gender inclusive” restrooms—is “part of our responsibility to create a welcoming environment.” She added that the creation of gender-neutral bathrooms will now be a part of all major renovation projects College-wide. 
Further, she said the gender-neutral bathrooms will benefit “anyone who is uncomfortable accessing a gender-specific bathroom,” including parents accompanying young children of a different gender, or people with disabilities who require an attendant of a different gender.
The statement, released last week, garnered praise from leaders of Harvard’s Queer Students and Allies, whom dela Peña said personally thanked her.
In an official statement responding to the announcement, QSA wrote its members were “heartened” by College administrators’ commitment to issues of gender inclusion, especially in the wake of recent events at Harvard and nationwide.
Earlier this semester, a broken sign of a gender-neutral bathroom in Eliot House elicited concern, with some students characterizing the destruction an instance of vandalism “transphobia.” Soon after, over a dozen Undergraduate Council representatives issued a joint statement in support of the College’s BGLTQ population, and Eliot House staff held a town hall to discuss the event.
Dela Peña said in an interview after the release of the statement that she considers a commitment to gender inclusivity “just the right thing to do.”
“There’s a lot of stuff going on around the country around gender neutral restrooms,” she said. “We wanted to let our LGBT community know that this is on our radar.”
Still, the response from QSA argued the University could do more in terms of BGLTQ inclusion. In their statement, QSA said that Harvard would benefit from increased resources and programming for BGLTQ students, sensitivity trainings for College staff, and a more swift response to “other incidents of transphobia on campus.”
“QSA hopes to work with the administration as it continues to address issues of exclusion and unfairness,” the statement said.
The renovation of Winthrop House, next on tap for House renewal, will take place over the course of the 2016-2017 academic year, starting this summer. Harvard will next renovate Lowell House beginning in the summer of 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a letter to the editor Sunday, coaches of three prominent teams praised Harvard’s new sanctions against single-gender groups, marking the first public reaction from the athletic community to a policy that will bar athletes in unrecognized single-gender social organizations from team captaincies starting with the Class of 2021.
Although at least one athletic recruiting expert does not think the policy will have an appreciable effect on Harvard’s recruiting efforts, former coaches and current captains anticipate the policy will disincentivize athletic involvement in single-gender social clubs.
In the letter, basketball coach Tommy Amaker, baseball coach Bill K. Decker, and football coach Tim Murphy expressed support for the sanctions, despite acknowledging what they called the “positive formative value” some single-gender social organizations had on their players.
“[W]e are committed, alongside Harvard to make strides in strengthening inclusion on our campus” the coaches wrote. “We are hopeful that the recently announced framework for student membership in unrecognized single-gender social organizations released by President Faust and Dean Khurana will further that end.”
While the College’s new sanctions have sparked an impassioned reaction on campus and in the national media, many in Harvard’s athletic circles have been much quieter about the policy.
Amaker and Murphy, through Director of Athletic Communications Timothy J. Williamson, declined to respond to questions on the policy. Coaches of six other varsity clubs, again through Williamson, declined comment for this story. Nearly 30 undergraduate captains of varsity teams either declined or did not to respond to requests for comment for this story.
Harvard has 42 varsity sports teams, the most in the NCAA Division I. Roughly 20 percent of students participate in varsity athletics, according to the althetics department website.
Peter P. Roby, who coached the basketball team from 1985 to 1991 and is now the athletic director of Northeastern University, said in an interview that he would have stood by the sanctions.
“I wouldn’t have had an issue with [the policy].I would’ve been someone who worked at Harvard that respected what they’re trying to do,” Roby said. “I think there’s reasons for it. In my view, those reasons are valid if there are things being done in those clubs that aren’t inclusive or aren’t necessarily respectful towards women.”
Katie Gibson ’17, who captained the women’s alpine skiing team last year, said she was frustrated that the sanctions took away a “social outlet” many students enjoy.
“We’re all really close with our teammates. But these clubs have been a good way for us to make social connections outside of just our classmates and teammates,” Gibson said.
Despite criticism of the policy, former University of Pennsylvania gymnastics coach and president of Victory Collegiate Consulting Tom Kovic said he doubts the sanctions will hamper coaches’ recruiting efforts.
“I do not think the policy change will affect Harvard athletics’ recruiting at all,” Kovic wrote in an email. “The main reason prospects choose Harvard is because it is one of the highest regarded academic institution of higher learning worldwide and they field brilliant college athletics programs at the D-1AA level.”
While it may not affect recruiting, Roby suspected the policy would mitigate athletes’ involvement in unrecognized single-gender social groups.
“It’s inevitable that if a player knows that there’s a chance that they could not be eligible to be a captain of a Harvard team, they might think twice about joining that club,” Roby said.
