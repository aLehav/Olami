After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the full ensemble of musicians took the stage to perform last Saturday, Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra president Gabriel B. Walker ’13 welcomed the audience and remarked that the night’s presentation of Acts II and III of Puccini’s “Tosca” was a first for his group. The orchestra had never performed two acts of an opera before, let alone with a trio of professional singers supported by student singers filling the other roles. Despite a few issues of tone and sound balance, the concert was a resonding success due to the interplay between the singers and orchestra.
“Tosca” is one of the most frequently performed operas by the popular early 20th-century Italian composer Giacomo Puccini. It tells the tragic story of painter Mario Cavaradossi (Brian Landry) and celebrated singer Floria Tosca (Kate Mangiameli) two lovers in 19th-century Rome. Their romance becomes complicated when Cavaradossi’s dissident political leanings make him a target of Baron Scarpia (Jake Gardner), the ruthless Roman chief of police. The lyrics to “Tosca” are all in Italian, which can make it challenging for an English-speaking audience to appreciate the story. However, the HRO employed a simple solution to this problem by projecting a superscript translation on a screen above the stage as the opera progressed
The singers’ expressive interpretation of Puccini’s songs and arias were a highlight of the performance. Gardner conveyed the duplicitous character of Scarpia through nuanced vocal expression, using a commanding voice while interrogating Cavaradossi and switching to a gentler cadence while attempting to charm Tosca later in the act. Mangiameli’s physical communication beautifully supported her voice. She casts a knowing smile when she informs Mario of her plan to help him escape Rome’s most notorious prison, the Castel Sant’Angelo, and this says more about her cunning than the libretto alone could allow. Landry was captivating as he sang, “E lucevan le stelle.” However, his voice was both a strength and a weakness. For instance, at one point in the opera, Cavaradossi learns that the royalist regime has lost a major battle and exclaims triumphantly “vittoria!” These defiant cries of victory were sung with great gusto by Landry but were a bit sharp in pitch.
The orchestra was effective in establishing the mood of different scenes in the performance and heightening the drama. During times of tension between characters, such as Scarpia’s attempts to proposition Tosca, the strings played a sustained and suspenseful note. Incidences of violence were heralded by a timely crash of a cymbal. Given that there was no backdrop, the harp and flutes enabled the audience to envision a pleasant vista when the windows in Scarpia’s quarters were opened. The instrumentalists worked to complement the singers by matching the vocalists’ crescendos and decrescendos. They were effective in doing so most of the time, but there were a few dramatic moments, such as when Tosca is forced to listen Cavaradossi being tortured, during which the orchestra became so loud and powerful that it was impossible to make out the words the vocalists were singing.
The performance was not entirely devoted to “Tosca.” Before Act II of the opera, five percussionists, each wearing false mustaches, performed a piece called “Head Talk” by Mark Ford. In it, the five wandered on stage, found several percussion instruments strewn about the floor, and gingerly picked them up and began constructing increasingly complex rhythms. “Head Case” had a distinctively whimsical character, not only because of the mustaches but also because of some gags in the routine. One memorable bit involved one percussionist who would watch the others play for a while, then attempt to join in, only for the others to stop playing and glare with disapproval. As a standalone piece it was entertaining, but it was somewhat odd to witness such a lighthearted work in the same sitting as the tragedy of “Tosca.” The few hitches in “Tosca” involving the balance of the orchestra and the singers and the brief errors in pitch ultimately did not undermine the successes of the night. The impassioned vocal performances with the support of the vivid orchestral accompaniment made for a strong concert. This sort of operatic presentation may not be something that the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra does often, but based on Saturday’s concert it is something they ought to consider doing again.

Who doesn’t love a scandal? Shocking tabloid headlines about perverted murder stories, sensationalized break-ups, and pregnant 16-year-olds make great conversational fodder.  Eric Bogosian’s 1987 opus “Talk Radio,” which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, is a darkly comedic look at media culture.  Despite its age, the story of a scandalous late-night Cleveland talk show host remains chillingly relevant to America’s contemporary media and entertainment cultures.
The play follows a tension-filled night on Barry Champlain’s (Phil M. Gillen ’13) popular radio show, “Night Talk.”  One by one, Barry railroads his callers and immediately deems them nutty and pathetic with his scathingly sarcastic humor. Among the many callers seeking Barry’s opinion on the air include a sports addict and a veteran both played by Rob A. Knoll ’13. Tensions run high as the entertaining radio show is about to break out from its regional audience and get picked up by an important national broadcasting station.
For a show with a relatively large cast, there is a surprisingly small number of visible actors. “The main character is on stage for essentially the entire play, which is rare for Harvard. Half the dialogue takes place off stage,” says Knoll. This sparceness gives a sense of a radio host alone in his booth interacting through his show with his faceless listeners. His combative tirades are complexly underscored by his straight shooting point of view.  As the play progresses, layers in his character are revealed and the recesses of his mind begin to be illuminated. “You see beneath this composed, in-control exterior. His whole life is the show,” says Gillen.
“The ’80s seem pretty tame compared to now, which makes it even more relevant. It’s very much a play for our time,” says director Caleb J. Thompson ’14, a Crimson arts writer. “It’s a satire of modern society.” As Barry grapples with the daunting possibility that his show will merely founder as part of America’s fiery cultural demise, “Talk Radio” holds up a mirror to our scandal-obsessed society. The question is, are we happy with what we see?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There once was a president who proposed a national government-run daycare program, a universal health care plan almost identical to the one eventually passed in 2010, and a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans. What’s more, he got all those measures—which, taken together, would have transformed the US into a bona fide, Western European-style social democracy—reasonably close to passage. He oversaw major Constitutional reform measures, including the lowering of the voting age to 18 and the passage by Congress of the Equal Rights Amendment, which banned discrimination on the basis of sex. He created the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupation Safety and Health Administration and signed the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act into law.
If you read enough articles like this one, you know that the president in question isn’t Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, or Lyndon B. Johnson, or anyone else you’d expect; that’d be too easy. No, it was Richard M. Nixon, enemy number one of the left for upwards of a decade and also the person who came closest to closing the gap between the American welfare state and those of all other developed nations. The fact that we cannot even imagine a conservative Republican advocating policies remotely similar today can tell us a lot about what has happened to U.S. politics since the 1970s. And the fact that Nixon failed in bringing the U.S. in line with its peer nations can tell us a lot about how hard it is to make real progress even when the fundamentals are on the side of change.
Today, it’s hard to imagine even a Democrat proposing some of Nixon’s agenda. A guaranteed minimum income would be laughed off the table, a silly proposal to give people an excuse to bum around and not work, rather than the devilishly effective anti-poverty measure it is. So what happened? Basically, the parties got more ideologically polarized, and the Republicans got much more conservative than the Democrats got liberal. As Jacob Hacker explained to The New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza, since 1975 Senate Republicans went twice as far to the right as Senate Democrats went to the left, and House Republican went six times as far to the right as House Democrats went to the left. The end result was that the political center shifted significantly rightward.
So we’re left with a Democratic president whose domestic agenda is less ambitious than that of a Republican president from three decades ago and a Republican opposition that decries that same agenda as rank socialism. No matter how well Obama plays his cards, the fact remains that he’s been dealt a terrible hand, and it would take reversing a generation-long national shift in political culture to change that. Obama could throw his heart and soul into a guaranteed minimum income proposal and it wouldn’t get half the momentum it did when Nixon pushed one.
But playing your cards well still matters, and advocates for a more generous welfare state played their cards really, really terribly in the 1970s. The man who killed Nixon’s health care plan was not a free market conservative but Senator Ted Kennedy ’56, who, preferring a single-payer approach, decried the Nixon proposal as little more than corporate welfare. Kennedy’s last fight, of course, would be pushing for passage of the Affordable Care Act, which shares most of its structure with the Nixon plan.
The death of Nixon’s childcare efforts was even more bizarre. As Edward F. Zigler, the administration’s head advisor on childcare, explains in his excellent book, “The Tragedy of Child Care in America,” Nixon first proposed a program to be run as a partnership between states and the federal government. But civil rights advocates like Marian Wright Edelman killed that plan for fear of increasing the power of segregationist state governors, preferring instead a technically unworkable plan that would have had the federal government coordinate childcare with thousands of individual municipalities. Their lobbying, combined with opposition from the religious right, ended up killing the effort entirely.
Changing the fundamentals is important, but how you perform given those fundamentals matters tremendously, as well. The fundamentals for health care reform were orders of magnitude better in the Nixon administration than they were in the first years of Obama’s tenure, and yet Obama got it done while Nixon failed. The difference was that liberals in 2010 knew how to take a win and liberals in 1974 didn’t. The day-in, day-out tactical dance of legislating is boring, disheartening stuff. But getting it right could not be more important.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m calling it now: Within forty years, the American people will put a computer science major in the Oval Office. Twenty years ago, around the time most current Harvard College students were born, this prediction would have seemed unlikely at best. But, now, as a generation that came of age alongside the personal computer transitions into seats of power, it is inevitable. 
 
 My first experiences with computers were like those of millions of other Americans. In 1994, my family brought home its first personal computer, fully equipped with MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows 3.1, and, most importantly, SkiFree. This was a time when floppy disks that were actually floppy were giving way to rigid disks that held an astonishing 1.44 megabytes; black screens with blinking prompts were giving way to standardized, ubiquitous graphical user interfaces like Windows; and the sentiment that computers belonged exclusively in the office was giving way to the realization that computers might not be just for work. By the time millions of kids pushed aside Encyclopedia Britannica and popped in the Encarta ’95 CD-ROM, it was clear that personal computers in the home were here to stay. 
 
 The next wave came quickly. Dial-up modems and computer programs like America Online connected users through their phone lines to the internet where they could "surf" the World Wide Web, a network of documents and files on servers connected with hyperlinks. And, now, the number of internet users worldwide has risen from near zero to near two billion. We all know this has transformed the world. Still, beyond certain exceptions (for example, Al Gore and the internet), a definite divide between computer scientists and everybody else has persisted. The stereotype of the computer "geek" remains strong. The computer scientist is bespectacled, withdrawn, and socially awkward. And he is invariably a “he.”  
 
 In our public discourse, this divide is most salient between political leaders and computer scientists. For example, a number of weeks ago, when Wikipedia went black to protest the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act introduced in Congress, it became a subject of much discussion that the most powerful people in the United States, on the floors of the Senate and House, had referred repeatedly to computer scientists as "nerds." In a rare display of bipartisanship, several lawmakers prefaced their (uninformed) comments with "I’m not a nerd, but..." and other condescending remarks. These lawmakers included Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.), Rep. Carrell Issa (R-Calif.), and perhaps most charmingly, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who suggested, "Maybe we ought to ask some nerds what this thing really does...Let’s have a hearing, bring in the nerds." 
 
 Let’s bring in the nerds, indeed. In thirty or forty years, our generation will occupy the highest political positions in America. It is quite possible that a future President of the United States of America took Computer Science 50 with Senior Lecturer David Malan ’99 last semester. Of course, we cannot predict who might take the top political spot in the United States decades from now, but it is clear that our generation is going to be the most computer-literate generation of leaders in American history.   
 
 Off the top of my head, I can think of several prominent student leaders just here in Harvard College who represent the type of person who may be leading the United States in the future. One is Peter D. Davis ’12, who started Harvard Thinks Big, and, with Max D. Novendstern ’12, founded CommonPlace, a Web site for civic engagement.  He has been a reasonable voice of the Occupy movement, and he exemplifies the kind of computer-literate leader that will become the norm in the next decades. Another is Eric Hysen ’11, former vice-president of the Undergraduate Council, computer science concentrator, and current software engineer at Google. On campus, he was the most efficient and methodical leader I’ve seen here, taking the problem solving skills one learns in CS and applying them everywhere. Leaders like Eric and Pete will become more common in the coming decades, as it is natural for members of our generation, who grew up with computers, to apply technological solutions to age-old problems.   
 
 The number of students studying computer science is spiking, and a consensus is growing that students should have a basic grounding in CS as part of a liberal arts education. In the next decades, displays of ignorance and disrespect towards “nerds”—like recent ones in Congress—will become relics of the past, and, at some point, I believe the first computer science major in the Oval Office will sit down at her desk, smile, and switch on her computer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, in an event that garnered enormous attention both within the Harvard community and outside of it, pop star Lady Gaga visited campus to launch the Born This Way Foundation. The event, held in Sanders Theatre, also featured television host Oprah Winfrey. Born This Way is a youth empowerment organization that intends to use grassroots activism and social media to combat bullying in schools—an experience Lady Gaga herself was a victim of during high school.
The pop star’s visit exemplifies the type of mutually beneficial relationship that our university occasionally cultivates with celebrities. On the one hand, the Harvard name lends credibility to stars that often find themselves mentioned in the tabloids more frequently than in respectable media outlets. On the other, partnering with high-profile figures allows Harvard to promote worthy causes, such as an end to bullying, in a public way that they would otherwise be unable to do.
This particular occasion also demonstrates the potential for the wider community to reap the rewards of a celebrity-institution relationship; indeed, this sort of symbiosis is most productive when the aim of the association is a specific, concrete goal, and not simply a flurry of attention. For instance, last year the Harvard Foundation awarded R&B legend Lionel Richie the Peter J. Gomes Award for humanitarian accomplishments. While it would be unfair to diminish Richie’s philanthropic achievements—he co-wrote the song “We Are the World” and has long been an activist for breast cancer research—it is regrettable that any number of hard-working, dedicated humanitarians were passed over in favor of someone best known for his music talent.
Lady Gaga’s visit shows the error of condemning Harvard for garnering media attention due to celebrity partnerships or visits that can be at first glance superficial. The Graduate School of Education, which organized the Lady Gaga event, is one of the least well-known schools on campus. The GSE has attracted significant attention as a result of this event, and this increased awareness will assuredly prove constructive for the graduate school, which put together a successful and well-planned opening for Born This Way. It is especially laudable that local high school students invited to participate in an anti-bullying summit were surprised by a visit from Lady Gaga herself, who provided words of encouragement. Given that Harvard has some notably strained relations with local communities, we would like to see similar, thoughtful attempts to foster positive connections in the future.
The one criticism we would level at Lady Gaga’s visit is in regards to the sheer hype that surrounded it. In the excitement over the presence of an idol, many students seemingly forgot or overlooked the purpose of her presence on campus. As the tragic shooting in an Ohio high school just two weeks ago reminded us, bullying remains an issue that needs to be urgently addressed. We applaud Lady Gaga and Harvard for tackling the issue, and urge her fans to do so as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone’s supposed to feel welcome at Harvard. Liberalism carries its own prejudices, of course, and conservatives, Southerners, and religious students can encounter snap judgments. But overall, society’s most marginalized groups find an atmosphere of respect here. I have always been impressed that Harvard students, unlike most young people, generally refrain from and frown upon offensive phrases like “That’s gay,” presumably out of consideration for their gay classmates.
Unfortunately, there is one hurtful minority slur that Harvard students tolerate and embrace: “retard.” “Mentally retarded” was originally an appropriate clinical term for people with intellectual disabilities, but over time has evolved into slang, common at Harvard and elsewhere, for “stupid” or “dumb.”
This word hurts. When a word that is directly associated with people with intellectual disabilities becomes society’s label for things that are undesirable, it sends the signal that they too are undesirable. It stigmatizes them in the minds of others, regardless of whether those using the word are intentionally making fun of people with intellectual disabilities or not.
I know this because my sister, Natalie, was born with severe intellectual disabilities. She only knows a few words, and mentally functions at the level of a toddler despite being in her 20s. She is also the happiest person I know. She brings joy into every life she touches. I think of her every time I hear another student casually use the r-word. It doesn’t matter if the student uses the word without malicious intent. My sister and the r-word are too inextricably linked for me not to feel like she has just been laughed at.
If you are skeptical, ask yourself how a member of any other group would feel if we used a term referring to them the way we currently use “retarded.”
Imagine how hurtful it is for a child with intellectual disabilities who understands the meaning of the r-word to hear his or her classmates use it to describe everything they don’t like.
When will we start affording the roughly five million Americans with intellectual disabilities the respect enjoyed by nearly every other minority? It goes without saying that their intellectual difficulties are no fault of their own. Any one of us could have been born in their place. They are all individuals with unique personalities and senses of humor. They are students, athletes, musicians, and employees. They have millions of friends and family who love them. They’re human and deserve to be treated as such.
Some have argued that fighting labels is pointless because new disparaging terms will arise until the underlying prejudice disappears. That’s possible, but making clear that it is unacceptable to disrespect a minority can help change people’s attitudes toward that minority. The taboo on using the n-word, for example, reminds people that it is wrong to be prejudiced against African-Americans, and a taboo on using the r-word would do the same for people with intellectual disabilities.
For a community facing such high obstacles to respect already, the last thing it needs is an enemy in our language. A society’s vocabulary has an early and powerful influence on children. It’s time to stop using slang that reinforces prejudice against people with intellectual disabilities.
Language, however, is but one component of the change America needs to make with regard to those with intellectual disabilities. True respect permeates all aspects of life. State and federal governments must promote access to healthcare, education, and employment for people with intellectual disabilities. This imperative is more pressing than ever after the bone-deep cuts in intellectual disability spending since the Great Recession.
To promote awareness of the hurtful effects of the r-word, and to encourage people to stop using it, today the Special Olympics is sponsoring “Spread the Word to End the R-Word Day.” Please consider signing the online pledge.
This is not a call for censorship. We want people to realize the pain this word causes and decide for themselves to stop using it out of respect for others’ feelings. Nor is this a plea for political correctness, but rather for consideration. Nobody is denying the existence of intellectual disabilities. A community of people and those who love them are asking that a word that deeply hurts them no longer be used. It’s long overdue that society does for those with intellectual disabilities what it did long ago for Americans of Chinese, African, Italian, Jewish, and Mexican descent.
You’re not a bad person if you’ve used the r-word, but now you know it hurts. Resolve today to stop and urge others to do the same. Let’s promote respect for those with intellectual disabilities and begin treating the r-word like any other minority slur in everyday conversation and in music, television, and movies. As for Harvard, let’s finally make all offensive and hurtful minority slurs on campus a thing of the past.

Lisa Wade, Ph.D., a Sociology professor at Occidental College, studies the role of sex, sexuality, and gender in society. She will be speaking at Harvard’s inaugural Sex Week, which starts March 25. FM recently chatted with Wade about hooking up, sexual dissatisfaction, and “liberated sex.”
1. Fifteen Minutes: What do you find interesting about studying sex and gender?
Lisa Wade: Of all the social inequalities that we have in the United States, sex and gender [inequality] is unique in requiring people who are positioned differently to be intimate. We push men and women together, whereas when you look at race and class, for example, we actually actively separate groups through residential and occupational segregation. That makes for an interesting dynamic in looking at how gender inequality works.
2. FM: Sex is in the news, in the movies, and in our conversations; it’s a big part of our lives. Why are we so obsessed with sex?
LW: Sex is a natural drive, like hunger and the need for comfort. It’s one of the things that a capitalist society, driven by a market, is inevitably going to fixate on. Think about how much of our advertising is driven around food. Today we have become so good at producing so much more than we need, and one of the ways we convince people to buy particular products is by sexualizing [them].
3. FM: You have said that the average college student has somewhere between four and seven hook-ups during their college career. Most people, however, seem to have the impression that the number is much higher. Why?
LW: This is a phenomenon that psychologists call “pluralistic ignorance,” where the majority of people misunderstand what is going on. We see it in lots of different arenas—we certainly see it in how much college students think other people are drinking and doing drugs. The key is understanding the difference between a college campus on which there is hooking up and a college campus that is characterized by a hook-up culture.
4. FM: What role do you think that television and the media’s very casual attitude toward sex has played in shaping society’s views on sex?
LW: It certainly contributes to the pluralistic ignorance and the idea that college is going to be constant sex with attractive people and that that’s how you have fun in college. We get the idea that someone who is cool and interesting and exciting is someone who is doing it and doing it with whoever, whenever, however.... The media seems to be saying that students who don’t participate are just irrelevant and off the social map altogether, and that’s a pretty harsh punishment to someone who objects to what’s going on or wishes it were different.
5. FM: You have said that college students typically want to feel pleasure, meaningfulness, and empowerment from their sexual experiences, but are not getting this from casual hook-ups. What are ways in which people can find these elements in sexual relationships?
LW: Students have difficulty getting what they want out of sexual encounters because these encounters are shaped by a lot of things in our society that are bad: sexism, heterosexism, racism, and this relentless pressure to be really hot and sexy. All these things shape hook-ups so they tend to be less rewarding. But all of these things also shape relationships. So what we need to fix isn’t the way in which people are sexual with one another but the context in which sex is happening. We like to say that hook-up culture is a problem unique to college, but there’s nothing that’s happening on college campuses that doesn’t also reflect our wider society.
6. FM: In your lecture on hook-up culture on MTV’s Canada “Impact,” you also mentioned that about 30 percent of college students opt out of sex altogether. Are these students missing out on important sexual experiences in any way?
LW: A lot of students that do not like hook-up culture say that even the bad experiences they’ve had have taught them a lot. They learn what kind of relationship does feel good to them, and how they reach their boundaries when they’re alone with someone, and how it feels to be empowered enough to make their feelings about what they do and don’t want to do matter.
7. FM: Is the hook-up culture as prevalent in the gay community?
LW: Hook-up culture is predominantly something that white, middle and upper-class, heterosexual people do. Heterosexual people do it more than homosexual people, although I suspect that this varies quite tremendously by what kind of campus we’re talking about. On campuses where gay people can be openly out and find each other more easily without threat, I suspect that there is more hooking up.
8. FM: You teach a class called “Race and Ethnicity in American Society.” How does race and ethnicity play a role in how people express their sexuality?
LW: People who are not white have to manage the stigma of being a racial minority, so they have to think, “How will what I do reflect on my group?” So people of color tend to make choices that are a bit more conservative. If we have stereotypes that African Americans are hyper-sexual or that Asian American women are hyper-available sexually, then these groups will oftentimes manage these stereotypes by not making as many choices to go ahead and be sexual, especially publicly.
9. FM: Websites like OkCupid and DateMySchool seem to be getting more popular among college students. How do you think online dating might change the dating culture on college campuses?
LW: I think it‘s a good thing for students to have more options. But we have to remember that, just like relationships that form on college campuses, these relationships that form online are also going to be infected with all the troubles of hook-up culture.
10. FM: You teach a class called “Debating Controversial Issues in Sexuality,” and one of the questions you explore is “What is good sex?” What, in your opinion, is good sex?
LW: I think the better question would be, “What would be safe, liberated sex?” We like to think that we have that already, but what the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s gave us is the opportunity to say “yes” to sex. But what it didn’t give us was the opportunity to say “no.” So students feel comfortable saying “yes” to sex, but they also feel like it’s increasingly difficult to say “no.” They feel like they should lose their virginity and have casual sex, and they feel bad about wanting to say “no.” What I would like to see is a world where people could say “yes” or “no” to any kind of sexual activity to any kind of person for any reason without social repercussions.
11. FM: Do you think this pluralistic ignorance makes people feel like they have to have sex more frequently nowadays?
LW: I think it goes both ways. Some students who always would have wanted to have casual sex now really can do it without having to worry about the stigma that comes with that. But, on the flip side, it’s also true that a lot of students who wouldn’t otherwise engage in casual sexual encounters are doing so because they don’t know what else to do. Students often say, “I really don’t want to do this, but this is what everyone’s doing and it’s the only option for me. My only chance for sex and relationships or anything in between has to happen this way.”
12. FM: Based on your research and discussions with your students, what do you think is the average college student’s attitude toward sex?
LW: When students arrive on campus their first year, they are very excited about what they think is going to be lots and lots of sex and lots and lots of fun. They often start getting disappointed right away and find themselves getting disappointed with so little pleasure and feelings of empowerment. But they don’t feel like they can change the way it is. The majority of students hook up now and then, but they have mixed feelings about what’s going on—they’re excited about the opportunity to be sexual but they’re also frustrated. Over the four years of college, students spend less and less time hooking up.
13. FM: Do male and female college students differ in their attitude toward sex?
LW: I think that both men and women largely would like it to be different. But I think that because men suffer less negative consequences—they’re less likely to be sexually assaulted and to face social stigma—men tend to be equally dissatisfied but somehow less miserable.
14. FM: What are some of the most troubling gender stereotypes that persist today in relation to sex and sexuality?
LW: I think one of the big problems is all this relentless pressure to be hot and to be having sex. For young women in particular, a lot of them have deeply internalized this idea that their attractiveness is a measure of their worth. The only way for women to know that they [are worthy] is for men to give them sexual attention. Even women who understand that this is not particularly good for them or something they want, they still really need the validation from men and will do whatever it takes to get it.
15. FM: Why do you think Sex Week and talking about sex is important? Have you found that sex is something college students are eager to talk about or do they prefer to avoid the subject?
LW: College students are desperate to talk about sex for the most part. Things like Sex Week are important because our sex education in this county is so pathetically bad that students learn very little about sex from their parents or from school. So then the main educating force in our society about sex is the media: movies, TV, reality shows, pornography.... [Sex Week] will hopefully give students at least a little bit of power to try to wrest some autonomy from these forces that are trying to shape them.

THE DATE WAS MATCHED
Geraldine: He looked vaguely familiar when I met him. So, we met in Kirkland dhall and we sat down, and it became very clearly obvious that the reason that his name sounded familiar was because he was my top Datamatch.
Patrick: I was just excited about the adventure.
Geraldine: And I had been stalking him on Facebook that day because I was writing recommendations. I’m in Crimson Key, and he’s in the second round [of the comp], and I was stalking literally every single person. So I had been looking at his Facebook this afternoon. He was very excited.
Patrick: She also knows some of my friends. It seemed like another coincidence among the many.
Geraldine: I was really happy to get to know him. I had a really good time.
Patrick: It wasn’t really awkward; I feel like we’re both personable people so the conversation flowed easily.
Geraldine: So, you set me up with a freshman. He was kind of cute in an, “I’m 21, he’s 18” way.
Patrick: We talked about some of our similarities, like how she’s 21 and I’m 18.
NO STRINGS ATTACHED
Geraldine: It was nice because I actually kind of enjoyed the blind date experience because, you know, there’s no pressure. It’s fun, no pretense of anything. It was really just like meeting someone in the dhall, it was just good fun. B+
Patrick: If there’s another date, maybe there will be a little spark. A great time, a great dinner, meeting a new person who’s nice and a person who I’d like to know further. A

LET’S GET IT ON
Leah: I was feeling a little bit apprehensive, just because I’ve been on blind dates before, and normally at least I’ve gotten a chance to stalk them online. But, I was excited because it’s fun to meet someone new regardless of whether you have a romantic connection or not.
Joshua: I’ve never been on a blind date before, but, I didn’t feel terribly nervous. I’ve been so busy today that any emotional energy I could expend on being nervous has been totally sapped.
Leah: It actually wasn’t awkward. I would say that we’re both pretty personable people; he was certainly lively and we had plenty to talk about.
Joshua: Conversation did flow, I thought. For some reason, every conversation I have with everyone tends to lead back to the same things: disillusionment about how conventional everyone is, Jewish stuff, and basically the things that we’re respectively studying.
Leah: We actually both happen to be Jewish and we talked a lot about Jewish stuff, interestingly. He studies Hebrew and Arabic so we talked about Israel and Jewish things on campus, and it was fun.
Joshua: I also thought it was really awesome that she was a jazz singer. She said she played at the Winthrop Housing Day Stein club last year and I remember being blown away by the vocals.
 
YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS
Leah: We had a great time but I don’t think it’s going to lead to a future, fruitful romance. It was a cordial yet platonic departure. B+
Joshua: It was a joy talking to her. It felt like I was just meeting someone for dinner. I don’t think there was any romantic subtext. But that’s fine; I like meeting new people. Meeting a new, interesting, genuinely likeable person rates as better than most experiences I could have here. B

On the night of March 5, 2011, 400 Harvard undergraduates gathered in a cramped, aging building on the far side of the Charles River. They cheered and chanted, and they believed their team would win. And indeed it did, as the Crimson defeated Princeton to win a share of its first-ever Ivy League championship.
One year later, the Harvard men’s basketball team managed to pull it off again.
Penn’s 62-52 loss to Princeton Tuesday evening let the Crimson clinch the school’s first-ever outright Ivy title and send it to its first NCAA tournament since 1946.
The story of how it reached that milestone—one that overcame 112 years of on-court mediocrity—involves far more than just a 19-man roster that went 26-4 during its regular season.
It encompasses a coach in search of redemption, an athletic director determined to oversee the rebirth of one of the most maligned programs in college basketball, and an impassioned group of Harvard graduates with the resources to do something about it.
THE DARK AGES
Exactly five years before the ebullience of clinching its second consecutive Ivy title—which it did on Saturday at Cornell—the Harvard men’s basketball team was down and defeated on the final night of the 2006-07 regular season.
That evening, the Crimson fell at Columbia, dropping its ninth conference game and bringing another disappointing season to an end. The 2006-07 campaign was like many others that the program had experienced—the Crimson’s 12-16 overall record marked the team’s fifth straight losing season.
Harvard hadn’t been faring much better in conference play, either; the 2006-07 season marked the fifteenth time in then-head coach Frank Sullivan’s 16-year reign that the Crimson failed to finish with a winning record, extending Harvard’s Ivy League title drought. Despite its success in other sports, the Crimson was the only team in the Ancient Eight never to have won a basketball championship.
“We underperformed, for sure,” says Drew A. Housman ’09, the Crimson’s starting point guard during the 2006-07 season. “[After the season] we all felt like...something needed to be shaken up.”
Two days after the Crimson’s season-ending loss to the Lions in 2007, the Harvard athletic department announced it was making a change: Sullivan, at the time the longest-tenured coach in Harvard basketball history, was being let go. That decision set in motion a series of events that would lead to the emergence of the Harvard men’s basketball program on the national stage.
 JUST NOT ENOUGH
Eight hundred miles west, the University of Michigan men’s basketball program was experiencing similar feelings of disappointment.
Heading into the 2006-07 season, expectations were high for the Wolverines. Michigan’s coach, 41-year-old Tommy Amaker, was entering his sixth season at the helm and had assembled a talented roster led by seniors Courtney Sims and Dion Harris that appeared primed to take the Wolverines back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1998.
But after jumping out to a 14-3 start, the Wolverines faltered midway through conference play and were forced to settle for a spot in the National Invitational Tournament, where they were bounced by Florida State in the second round.
“It was a really ugly end to the season,” recalls The Detroit Free Press’ Mark Snyder, who has covered Wolverine basketball since 1998. “They just got blown out of the gym, and I think that was enough.”
On March 17, two days after the loss, the University of Michigan announced it was letting Amaker go.
“The bottom line was that he never reached the NCAA tournament, and that’s why he was fired,” Snyder says. “It was basically that simple.”
And just like that, Amaker was in search of a new job.
GRAND OPENING
Back in Cambridge, the Harvard Department of Athletics, led by Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise, was setting the stage for an extensive coaching search by meeting with alumni to garner support.
For a program that had experienced so much mediocrity, Scalise had a grand vision of success. And a crucial step in reaching that goal was finding the right person to lead the charge.
“Bob Scalise made it pretty clear that he wanted somebody who could bring the program to the next level,” says Carmen J. Scarpa ’86, co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Basketball—an alumni organization that supports the basketball program—who was approached by Scalise in the early stages of the search. “Really what [Scalise] wanted was somebody who could win the Ivies, but really just make Harvard a program that year-in, year-out could always compete for an Ivy League championship.”
Before he could realistically go after top-tier coaching candidates, Scalise, who declined to comment for this story, sought a financial commitment from the program’s boosters to make the Crimson’s financial offer competitive with other Ivy League and upper-level programs.
According to Tom G. Stemberg ’71, the honorary chairman of the Friends of Harvard Basketball, the Crimson had been paying Sullivan well below the average Ivy League coaching salary.
Scalise approached Stemberg and other members about raising money to fund a salary increase to make the Harvard position competitive with other positions in the Ivy League. But according to Stemberg, it is practice that no Harvard coach can make more than a University Professor, effectively setting a cap on Amaker’s salary.
“Scalise said, ‘Look, the University is not going to give us more money. So if you guys want to see us get good at basketball, I’ll try to get us a really good coach and what goes with that. But you guys have to raise the money to pay for it,’” Stemberg recalls. “What happened is a very large group of us got together and said, ‘[Scalise] is serious about this.’”
Led by Stemberg, Scarpa, Thomas W. Mannix ’81, Joseph D. Carrabino ’84, and Fred Schernecker ’89, the Friends of Harvard Basketball called on former players to commit to supporting the program.
With the support in place, the search committee—which, according to Mannix, was composed of Scalise, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy, then-Assistant Director of Athletics Pat Miller, Scarpa, and himself—began its pursuit of top-tier coaching candidates.
Although the committee began sifting through candidates immediately after Sullivan’s dismissal, Amaker did not emerge on its radar until late in the search, after he was fired from Michigan. But it did not take long for him to become the clear frontrunner.
“Everybody in the basketball world knew him, and the Tommy Amaker brand was class and dignity,” Mannix says of the former Duke standout, who was named a third-team All-American as a senior and then served as an assistant coach on the Blue Devils’ 1991 and 1992 NCAA championship teams. “[He came] from a pedigree program...and the whole alumni network just lit up because of the image he has.”
According to Mannix, the fact that Amaker is African-American added to his appeal. Twenty-three days after Sullivan was let go, The Boston Globe ran a piece noting that Harvard did not have a single African-American among the athletic department’s 32 varsity head coaches and 13 senior administrators.
“Tommy’s like the Holy Grail,” Mannix says. “You get everything with him. You get a kind of name recognition they used to have with [former Crimson basketball coach and NBA Hall of Famer] Satch Sanders, with a guy that everybody knows. You get the integrity and honesty you had with Frank Sullivan, and you get the kind of charisma and African-American younger face that [former Harvard basketball coach and current Northeastern Athletic Director] Peter Roby offered.”
“Tommy’s all of the above, and on top of that, Tommy’s just passionate about the game and bringing the level of integrity, talent, and recognition to the program that we only dreamed of,” he adds.
Among the handful of coaches interviewed for the job, the decision came down to Amaker and Mike Jarvis, another big-name African-American coach who had been fired from St. John’s in 2003 despite leading the Red Storm to the Elite Eight in 1999 and the Big East tournament championship a year later.
For some members of the 2006-07 squad, the pedigree of the two finalists came as a surprise.
“At that point, you had no idea whether [members of the search committee] were just out of their minds and shooting too high and there was no realistic chance of actually getting these people, or if they really felt like they could go after some of these guys like Coach Amaker and get them,” recalls Andrew R. Pusar ’09, who captained the Crimson during the 2008-09 season.
But the committee’s seriousness became clear to Pusar when Jarvis and Amaker arrived on campus for interviews.
“When they finally brought in Mike Jarvis and Coach Amaker, it opened our eyes to how big the athletic department’s eyes were and what their objectives were,” Pusar says.
Jarvis and Amaker met with the team individually, and it quickly became clear that Amaker was the top choice.
The team “immediately gravitated to his vision of our future,” Pusar says. “Everyone came out of that meeting saying, ‘I want to play for that guy. I want him to walk in the next day. We’re on board with him and what he’s doing.’”
“Honestly, he had it won on his pedigree,” Housman says. “And then we met him, and he seemed really personable and a cool guy, so it was an easy decision for us.”
PREPARATION H
According to Scarpa, the Friends were prepared to make a financial commitment to the former Michigan and Seton Hall coach. But a large part of Amaker’s hiring relied on a commitment from the administration as well.
Amaker spoke with the admissions department to get a feel for the admissions standards for potential recruits, according to Scarpa.
“[Amaker] went to the athletic department admissions,” Scarpa says. “They weren’t going to admit players that didn’t belong, but I think [Amaker] needed to feel like, if he brought the proper players, that he could work cooperatively with admissions.”
On April 9, 2007, Amaker was offered the job, and he accepted, signing a five-year contract two days later.
“I can’t say how proud I am to be the committee’s selection,” Amaker said at his introductory press conference on April 15. “I certainly feel like it is going to be a joyous ride.”
The alumni were immediately excited by the new beginning Amaker provided.
“I knew right away we had made a great hire,” Mannix says. “My gut instincts with him, seeing where he had been and what he had done…. I knew we had hit a home run.”
After he agreed to coach the program, one of Amaker’s first requests was to renovate the locker room, and with that came small changes to other aspects of Lavietes Pavilion, such as improving the coaches offices and installing new video and stereo equipment in the facilities.
“He’s taken it in steps,” Scarpa says. “There’s been some money raised to renovate Lavietes and make it much more of a home court advantage.... I think these are things that have elevated the program in general.”
According to Schernecker, who played basketball at Harvard from 1985-89, alumni in the pre-Amaker era played less of a role in terms of supporting the program, with a few exceptions.
“The alumni support for basketball prior to Tommy Amaker’s arrival had been close to nonexistent,” Schernecker says. “We were woefully short in terms of our alumni and friends donations prior to Tommy’s hiring.”
With that precedent in mind, the Friends of Harvard Basketball began working after Amaker was hired, attempting to garner support for the new coach and his vision for the program.
“Getting right out, we did a little tour,” Mannix says. “[We took] Tommy to go out and meet-and-greet at different cities in the country and just say, ‘This is what I want to do, and this is why I need your help.’”
The Friends brought Amaker to Harvard Clubs in cities across the nation, including New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And the alumni responded exceptionally well to Amaker.
“It was just fabulous,” Mannix says. “He had an immediate response that was unprecedented. Alumni who had never given or who had never shown interest were suddenly showing interest, giving money, and coming back to games. It was just a radical transformation in the energy level.”
And, just like that, a symbiotic relationship between Amaker and the alumni base was formed.
GROWING PAINS
Given an unprecedented level of support from the University, Amaker was ready to make good on the promises he had made on his tours across the country. But in his first season, the Crimson struggled mightily, opening the year with a 55-point loss at Stanford. Harvard went on to finish 8-22 and winless on the road.
While the losses piled up, Amaker’s first campaign in Cambridge was quickly marred by controversy. On March 2, 2008, a day after the Crimson lost by 33 at Cornell to drop its record to 8-20, The New York Times reported on the front page of its Sunday sports section that Amaker had changed far more than simply the team’s offense since his arrival.
The article by Pete Thamel, titled “In a New Era at Harvard, New Questions of Standards,” alleged multiple recruiting violations by the program.
One of the piece’s most pointed accusations was leveled at Kenny Blakeney, who played at Duke in the early 1990s when Amaker was an assistant there and was hired as Amaker’s assistant coach when he came to Harvard.
Blakeney reportedly traveled to Virginia to play pick-up basketball with then-high school seniors Maxim M. Kenyi and Keith A. Wright Jr. ’12 in the summer of 2007, during a period when in-person contact with coaches was not allowed.
Harvard had announced the hiring of Blakeney on July 2, 2007, and Blakeney insisted that he had not been officially working for Harvard when he visited Kenyi and Wright, who both enrolled at Harvard a year later.
“I was unemployed,” the assistant told The Times. “I didn’t have any type of agreement with anybody. How could I recruit them to Harvard if I’m not employed?”
Harvard was eventually cleared by a league investigation several months after the initial New York Times report; an Ivy League release in September 2007 announced that both Amaker and Blakeney acted in a way that was “entirely consistent with NCAA and Ivy League rules.”
But some did not feel that the accusations against Blakeney had been fully resolved. In July 2010, Harvard reported an unintentional secondary violation to the NCAA in connection with the summer 2007 incident and self-imposed recruiting limitations for the 2010-11 season.
“Secondary violations” are defined by the NCAA as “inadvertent” and as providing at most a “minimal advantage” to the offending institution, said the league release, which also mentioned that the NCAA processes more than 2,000 secondary violations per year.
The release stated that Harvard chose to acknowledge the violation due to an NCAA ruling that Blakeney’s conversations represented improper recruiting assistance to Harvard.
“These events occurred three years ago, and I’m pleased to bring this two-year review to a conclusion,” Amaker wrote in a statement to The Crimson after the 2010 announcement. “This extensive and comprehensive inquiry yielded one minor and unintentional secondary.”
Thamel’s story concluded with an anecdote concerning the recruitment of now-Penn captain Zack Rosen, who starred at St. Benedict’s Preparatory School in New Jersey for two years. Thamel wrote that Rosen’s father, Les Rosen, encountered Amaker in a Trenton grocery store in summer 2007 during a nearby basketball tournament. At that point in the recruiting calendar, coaches were restricted to greetings if they met prospects or their parents.
Les Rosen told Thamel that he remembered Amaker saying, “We really have to get Zack up to Harvard,” and that he thought to himself, “Who goes to ShopRite in the middle of a basketball tournament?”
“It was suspicious,” Les Rosen told the Times, “but as much as it seemed obvious, he wouldn’t be found guilty in court.”
But in a recent interview with The Crimson, the father of the Quakers star remembered the encounter very differently.
“I couldn’t tell you in a million years why he was there...sometimes you run into your ex-wife at the supermarket,” Les Rosen says. “Yeah, it seemed like he may have been there to say hello to me, but even in the store, it wasn’t a dialogue. He said ‘Hello,’ and that was it.”
Rosen added that he now considers Amaker a friend, and the two regularly chat after Harvard-Penn games.
“It was meaningless to me, but people made a big deal about it. It was stupid to me that people even continue talking about it,” Rosen says. “I think it’s time to let it go.”
No punishment was ever applied by the league or the NCAA in relation to the incident, but Thamel was not yet finished tracking the actions of Amaker and his staff. Several months after publishing its initial story, The New York Times went on to report that Amaker had cut five players in early September. Thamel wrote that the move, which was made to allow room for Amaker’s first freshman class, was considered by many around the league to be in violation of the spirit of the Ancient Eight.
A look back at the 2008-09 men’s basketball roster reveals seven freshmen and a total of six juniors and seniors—none of whom were brought in by Amaker—but no sophomores.
Kyle B. Fitzgerald ’11, one of the three second-year players who was cut by Amaker, criticized the coach for not allowing former players the chance to compete for a playing spot as they had been promised in the spring of that year.
“Its [sic] tough to believe a coach doesn’t know whether or not he is allowed to have tryouts, and if he really didn’t, he really should have found that out before he told us all in the Spring,” Fitzgerald wrote in an email. “We were essentially kept on board as insurance.”
THE NEW WAVE
The first batch of new recruits, for whom Fitzgerald and others were cut, has been one of Amaker’s most significant contributions to the Crimson. Amaker’s opening group, which included Wright, Kenyi, Oliver R. McNally ’12, and Andrew F. Van Nest ’12, was the first Ivy class ever to be ranked in the top 25 in the nation by ESPN.
The strength of Amaker’s first crop of players came as no surprise given his history recruiting top players like future NBA All-Star Grant Hill, Eddie Griffin—considered by many to be the nation’s best prospect—and Ekpe Udoh—the future No. 6 overall pick in the NBA Draft—at Duke, Seton Hall, and Michigan, respectively.
Amaker has not yet received the commitment of a Top-50 recruit at Harvard, but doing so is not out of the question. The coach has managed to quickly adjust to the particular demands of athletic recruiting in the Ivy League, which imposes stringent academic requirements and does not allow athletic scholarships.
In examining a very small pool of students with both the academic and athletic skills to be accepted to Ancient Eight teams, Amaker and his staff have preached the message that Lavietes Pavilion is one of the only courts where players are offered the chance to contribute to something unprecedented.
“[Amaker said to me, ‘Harvard’s] the most famous school in the world,’” current co-captain McNally says. “In every field, athletically and academically, things have been done. Football’s won, soccer’s won, but basketball never had. You can make history. People will remember you and the team you played on as doing something Harvard had never done before, and you can’t really do that in a lot of other fields here.’”
“Harvard’s very easy to sell. It almost sells itself,” adds former assistant Will Wade.
Needless to say, plenty have bought into Amaker’s product. Prior to the 2008-09 season, Wade and company helped bring in a pair of three-star recruits in Van Nest and Kenyi, who received interest from Marquette, George Mason, and Holy Cross. Their rookie classmates also included eventual co-captains Wright and McNally, both two-star players.
“Coach Amaker didn’t have to say much to me,” Wright says. “I know that I’m not going to be able to play basketball all my life, so this was a decision I made for my family and the future, the family I will have. Harvard speaks for itself.”
The next year’s class strengthened the foundation for the first Harvard squads ever to win a share of the Ivy League championship.
In 2009, the team’s current juniors arrived, a group that included eventual all-Ivy players Kyle D. Casey ’13, Brandyn Curry ’13, and Christian Webster ’13, and reserves Demetrius A. Giger ’13 and Jeffrey M. Georgatos ’13.
“We were competing with other high academic schools,” says Wade, who served as the recruiting coordinator for Amaker’s first two years. He points to Vanderbilt, Stanford, and William & Mary as colleges which lost players to Harvard.
“Everybody was different: Kyle liked the idea of staying local, getting a great education, and being a part of something special,” Wade says. “Brandyn Curry—his mother was just a huge reason he came to Harvard. She was more than convinced that that was the place for him.... She was a driving force behind his recruitment.”
Wade departed for a post at Virginia Commonwealth University in April 2009, but Amaker has not missed a beat since, continuing to go after elite talent that normally may never have considered playing in the Ancient Eight.
Former Oklahoma graduate assistant Yanni Hufnagel took over as recruiting coordinator, and he and fellow assistant coach Brian DeStefano have helped Amaker steal highly touted prospects away from not only Ivy rivals but also major-conference schools.
Current freshmen Kenyatta A. Smith ’15 and Wesley S. Saunders ’15 held among them offers from Vanderbilt, Colorado, and USC, while breakout rookie E. Steve Moundou-Missi ’15 was named to the top 150 players in the nation by one analyst.
Next year’s group of freshmen already includes Mike Hall—ESPN’s No. 19 center in the country—along with Agunwa Okolie, Siyani Chambers, and Evan Cummins.
“An Ivy League school staying in the mix with these guys is shocking,” Jeff Borzello, a college basketball writer at CBSSports.com, told The Crimson in September. “There’s been high-major head coaches at mid-major schools before, and it doesn’t work like this. I think it’s really impressive.”
Having guided Harvard from mediocrity to a national ranking, Amaker and his staff are not holding back with members of the high school class of 2013; consensus top-100 players Davon Reed, Stephen Domingo, and Brannen Greene—who later committed to Kansas—visited campus in October.
“To score a single commitment from that package of players would be a very big deal for Harvard,” ESPN senior basketball recruiting analyst Dave Telep told The Crimson in September. “It doesn’t really happen in the Ivy League.”
“You had to get some guys early on who believed in your vision,” Wade says. “Now they can see that vision playing out, it’s probably a little bit easier, and maybe you can get involved with a player a step up from what we were involved in. It’s a natural progression.”
UNNATURAL RESOURCES
Along with high-level conference experience, Amaker was also fortunate to be hired shortly after significant changes were made to the school’s financial aid policy.
In 2006, Harvard announced that families with incomes of $60,000 or less would not be expected to pay anything for their education and families earning between $60,000 and $180,000 would be expected to contribute no more than 10 percent of their income. Over the past several years, Amaker and his fellow Ivy coaches have benefited from further changes that often allow students to avoid loans, even without full-ride scholarships.
He may have also been given advantages that his predecessors did not have. One of the 2008 New York Times article’s most damning allegations was that Harvard lowered its academic standards to improve the basketball program.
This led to criticism from former Harvard coaches—including Sullivan’s assistants Lamar Reddicks and Bill Holden, who declined to comment for this story—and other Ivy League schools, who cautioned that a desire to compete in basketball could tarnish Harvard’s “sterling reputation.”
For their part, Amaker and the Friends of Harvard Basketball deny the claim that the team’s Academic Index—a score ranging from 60 to 240 based on a combination of an applicant’s high school GPA and SAT scores that is used by Ivy League institutions to determine whether an applicant meets academic standards—has been changed.
According to Stemberg, increased availability of financial aid, not any change in standards, played the biggest role in securing commitments from highly-touted recruits.
“The change is financial aid. That’s the change. You look at the Academic Index—I haven’t checked this year—but the last few years, you look at the Academic Index of the recruited kids coming in, it is unchanged from the Sullivan years,” Stemberg says.
But Thamel stands by his reporting.
“Harvard can play semantic gymnastics, but it was laid out to me convincingly and on the record that they were lowering standards,” Thamel wrote in an email. “And they’ve only made it worse by denying it. The point of those Harvard stories was that Harvard is playing ball like everyone else—loosening academic standards, sending an assistant out on unethical recruiting trips, and cutting recruited kids from the program in September without having them try out.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 denies those claims.
“Harvard has maintained unchanged our high academic standards for all students and student athletes, including men’s basketball,” Fitzsimmons told The Crimson in an emailed statement. “The Ivy League has the most rigorous academic requirements of any athletic conference, and we are in full compliance with those standards. In fact, comparing the academic index for men’s basketball across the Ivy League, Harvard’s position relative to our peer institutions has also remained largely unchanged over the past decade.”
TOUGHER THAN IT LOOKS
But even with the new financial aid program in place, Amaker has not always been able to get his top targets into Harvard uniforms. The player initially cited in The New York Times article as emblematic of Harvard’s altered academic attitude for basketball recruits was Frank Ben-Eze, who reportedly chose the Crimson over Marquette, Virginia, and West Virginia.
But nine days later, Thamel reported that Ben-Eze had reopened his recruitment after being unable to reach the minimum Academic Index of 171. The 6’10” senior eventually went to Davidson, where he is currently preparing for the NCAA tournament.
The Ivy League’s high academic standards have played a significant role in the recruitment of other prep stars who ended up playing collegiate basketball elsewhere. An August 2009 Sports Illustrated story about Harvard reaching the lists of elite recruits featured four-star prospect Pe’Shon Howard, who was quoted as saying, “If the admission office clears me, I’m going to Harvard.”
That turned out to be a big “if.”
“Test scores, SAT scores, the way the application had to be filled out—just the whole process became a little stressful for me,” Howard says. “It took a little of the joy out of deciding on which school you wanted to go to. Trying to figure out how to make things work, I think time just kind of ran out.”
Howard committed to Maryland in Jan. 2010. There, he averaged six points and four assists per game before tearing his ACL in February.
“If it would have worked out, I probably would have been in a Harvard uniform,” Howard says, “But Maryland definitely picked up my interest, and I was really excited about them as well.”
The league’s academic standards have only increased in rigor. Over the summer, the minimum Academic Index score required for prospective student athletes to gain admission to the Ivy League was adjusted from 171 to 176, according to Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris.
Announcement of the adjustment has led to speculation that the change will hurt the Ivy League’s ability to compete on the national level—particularly in sports such as men’s basketball, hockey, and lacrosse—because it will reduce the pool of high school athletes from which Ivy coaches can recruit.
Boston College men’s basketball coach Steve Donahue, who served as head coach at Cornell from 2000 to 2010, said he anticipated the change since class rank was replaced by high school GPA in calculating the Academic Index.
Harris said that admissions deans had noticed applicants were receiving higher scores on the Academic Index when it was calculated with GPA instead of class rank. Therefore, Harris said, a change in the minimum was necessary in order to maintain the Ivy League’s academic standards from past years.
Rather than being perceived as an “increase” to the minimum floor, Harris says, the change should be seen as a necessary “adjustment.”
Like Harris, Donahue believes the change should not impact the competitiveness of Ivy League teams on the national level but stated that the occasional recruit who, in recent years, was admitted with an Academic Index calculated based on GPA while the floor was still at 171 might no longer be able to gain admission with the adjusted standard.
One player hurt by the new policy may be current Harvard-Westlake High School senior Zena Edosomwan, whose final list is currently Harvard, UC Berkeley, USC, Wake Forest, Texas, Washington, and UCLA. ESPN’s tenth-ranked player in the Golden State, the 6’8” forward is waiting for his latest set of SAT scores to qualify him academically for the only Ivy League school he is considering, according to Harvard-Westlake coach Greg Hilliard.
“He wants to go to Harvard,” says Hilliard of Edosomwan, who was initially 100 points shy of the score he needed but has since cut the deficit. “It’s up to getting the necessary score on the math side for the Index.”
“I’ve talked to all the coaches that are still waiting and hoping he comes to them, and none of them have ever run into somebody who has the options that he has and is waiting for a non-scholarship school, which I think is pretty amazing,” Hilliard adds. “His heart and mind are definitely in the right place.”
It remains to be seen whether Harvard will be the place for him.
SHOW ME THE MONEY
But more than just the Academic Index stands between Amaker and his highly sought-after prospects.
“I think the biggest hurdle still is financial,” said Donahue of the Ivy League’s lack of athletic scholarships. “It’s way more difficult to find kids that can afford this education and turn down scholarships than it is to find kids that are academically qualified. There are a lot of kids that are academically qualified.”
Even with Harvard’s financial aid policy, many potential recruits have been unable to resist the temptation of a full scholarship.
Four-star small forward Rod Odom Jr. included Harvard among his final choices and visited campus along with other top recruits Dwight Powell and Andre Hollins in fall 2009.
“[Amaker’s] an absolutely relentless recruiter,” says his father, Rod Odom Sr. “The reason why Harvard was there right until the end was because he’s a fantastic recruiter.”
The No. 66 player in the nation according to ESPN, Odom eliminated Harvard in October and first committed to Arizona but later switched to Vanderbilt, where he is now a sophomore.
“The thing that prevented Harvard from being in the last two was when we got the financial aid indication, which—compared to a full scholarship—couldn’t be a consideration for us,” Odom Sr. says.
Indeed, Amaker has not always prevailed against power-conference institutions, as other high schoolers have been attracted to Cambridge but ultimately chosen to go elsewhere due to personal preference.
Center Dwight Powell, who was ranked in the top 100 by ESPN, made an official visit to Cambridge in Sept. 2009 but eventually committed to Stanford, where he is averaging eight points and five rebounds as a sophomore. Harvard was also in the final five of Andre Hollins, who was also considering Mississippi, Auburn, and Stanford. He visited campus at the same time as Powell, but the shooting guard chose to attend Minnesota instead. The freshman had 18 points in a loss to No. 15 Wisconsin last week.
But the fact that the Crimson remained in consideration for such highly-touted recruits serves as an indicator of the progress that Amaker and his staff have made in just a few years.
“They recruited me just like they were a big-name school,” says Spencer Dinwiddie, who chose Colorado over Harvard, UNLV, Oregon, and UCLA. “The only difference was Yanni is probably the hardest-working recruiter in the NCAA. He’s the person who really made me think twice about Harvard and kind of opened my eyes to some things. Harvard is on that level basketball-wise, and they’ve proven it all season long.”
In a 2011 survey of more than 100 major Division I coaches, Hufnagel was dubbed the mid-major assistant most likely to make it big due to his recruiting ability.
“As long as Harvard continues to prove that they’re a high-level basketball program, then conference doesn’t matter,” Dinwiddie says. “It’s the same thing as a Butler or any other ‘mid-major’ school. If you can produce on the floor, there’s no reason Harvard shouldn’t be a prime option because of the academic standards it has.”
Yet, even without names like Powell, Hollins, or Dinwiddie on his roster, Amaker has delivered on his promises that his players would have the opportunity to make history.
ALL HE DOES IS WIN
Harvard improved to .500 in Amaker’s second season, finishing 14-14 overall and 6-8 in conference play. The squad was led by emerging guard Jeremy Lin ’10, who had been recruited by Sullivan and earned a starting job under Amaker.
The junior had 27 points in the Crimson’s Jan. 7 victory over then-No. 24 Boston College, which had won at No. 1 North Carolina just three days before. The win marked Harvard’s first-ever win over a ranked opponent and the Ivy League’s first over an ACC team in six years.
One year later, led by Lin—a Cousy and Wooden Award finalist—and Casey, who won Ivy Rookie of the Year, the Crimson won 21 contests and finished 10-4 in the Ancient Eight. But after being blown out by Cornell in a contest then-deemed "the biggest game in Harvard basketball history," and losing its next game to Princeton despite a dramatic late comeback attempt, the squad finished third in the conference. That record earned the Crimson its first postseason invite since 1946, but it lost at Appalachian State in the first round of the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament.
CHAMPIONSHIP FEVER
In 2010-11, Harvard clinched a share of its first-ever Ivy title in program history. Led by Wright, who was named the Ivy League Player of the Year, the Crimson won a program-record 23 games.
After losing its season opener at George Mason, Harvard won 15 of its next 17 contests and jumped out to a 10-1 start in conference play before falling, 70-69, at Yale, on a Curry miss at the buzzer.
Back at Lavietes the following weekend, the Crimson had to sweep the Killer P’s to keep its tournament dreams alive. It easily topped Penn on Friday night, then on Saturday faced league-leading Princeton with the chance to clinch a share of its first-ever Ivy title in front of a celebrity-laden crowd.
Casey's 24 points helped squad pull out a 79-67 win, which, combined with Princeton’s victory over Penn three days later, set up a one-game playoff with the Tigers the following Saturday for the right to go to the NCAA tournament.
On the final play of the game, Princeton’s Doug Davis brought a swift end to the Crimson’s tournament hopes, sticking a mid-range jumper at the buzzer to give the Tigers a 63-62 win.
The next day, Harvard learned it would have to wait at least another year for its first NCAA Big Dance berth in 65 years, as the squad’s RPI of 35 was the highest of any team not to be included in the 68-team field. Instead, the Crimson was sent to Stillwater, Okla. to face Oklahoma State in the National Invitation Tournament. The No. 6-seeded Crimson was blown out in the first round, ending its season.
TOURNAMENT TIME
This year, Harvard finally got over the hump.
The squad started its season 8-0, highlighted by a Thanksgiving championship in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas. Over a three-game stretch, the Crimson topped Utah, then-No. 22 Florida State, and Central Florida to take home its first-ever tournament title.
On Dec. 5, Harvard earned its first-ever Top-25 ranking, appearing at No. 24 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 25 in the Associated Press poll.
It stayed ranked for seven of the following eight weeks, finishing with a program-record 24 wins and its first-ever tournament berth.
“For these kids to play the way they’ve played and to have a spirit and energy develop around our basketball team and games, that’s worth its weight in gold to me,” Amaker says. “The journey has been rewarding and in some ways it's happened fairly quickly...but if you think of how far we’ve come and the success that have evolved and developed, we are very happy and thrilled about where we are and excited about where this thing may go.”
Indeed, things have certainly come a long way from the Sullvan era.
“[Harvard basketball] had been completely irrelevant,” says ESPN.com senior basketball writer Andy Katz, who grew up in nearby Newton. “And that’s what’s unbelievable about what Tommy has done.”
BACK TO THE FUTURE
On Feb. 25, the Crimson fell to Penn, 55-54, in front of a sold-out crowd of 2,195 at Lavietes. The frustrating loss brought an end to Harvard’s 28-game home-winning streak, snapping what was then the second-longest such run in the nation.
Under Amaker, Harvard has had a great deal of success at its tiny home gym (of the 345 Division I men’s basketball programs in the nation, only 25 play in smaller-capacity venues), going 39-3 there over the past three seasons.
“There’s a lot to be said for having a place that might be a little bit smaller and cozier,” Schernecker said. “The crowds and the fact that we’re filling the place make [Lavietes] somewhere very difficult for opponents to play.”
But while Lavietes Pavilion has become an integral part of the Crimson’s success, there was a time not too long ago that it looked like Lavietes’ days as the home of the Harvard men’s basketball program might be coming to an end.
Prior to the 2008 recession and the steep decline in the University’s endowment, the construction of a new basketball stadium in Allston was in consideration.
“Before the stock market took that big dive it did and the endowment had that big struggle, there was a greater plan for all of those facilities on that side of the river to eventually be relocated,” Mannix says.
Those plans, however, were put on hold with the bad economy. Today, the construction of a new stadium in Allston remains in discussion.
“It’s still a subject of conversation,” Stemberg adds. “People are still talking about it. Nobody’s done anything yet because nobody’s given up the money, but I think, you know, if the money were there, I think we’d get it done.”
New stadium or not, Stemberg says he thinks the Crimson can retain Amaker, who will likely be wooed by high-major programs after this season given the turnaround he has accomplished in Cambridge.
After last season, Amaker was offered the head coaching job—and a significant pay raise—at the ACC’s University of Miami but decided to turn it down.
But, Stemberg says, “I don’t think to retain Tommy we need to do anything more than what we are already doing.”
Some members of the Friends of Harvard Basketball worry that the coach’s days with Harvard could come to an end if an attractive program extends a coaching offer.
Mannix opines, “If Duke ever lost Coach [Mike Krzyzewski], maybe [Amaker] would want to go back to where he played. And who would blame him for that, right? That’s his alma mater. That’s a premiere basketball program in the country. But outside of an opportunity like that, which I wouldn’t begrudge him or blame him one bit if he took that, I think Tommy Amaker is right where he wants to be, and I feel very comfortable that he’s going to be here for a long time.”
Katz thinks Amaker could not be happier at Harvard, where his wife, Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, is on the Harvard Medical School faculty.
“I think he and his wife love it there,” Katz says. “He knows he has a tremendous situation, so I don’t think he will [leave]—at least not in the near term.”
As long as he stays, Amaker should continue to attract top-level talent to Cambridge, and Lin’s success with the NBA’s New York Knicks this season will only help Amaker’s efforts.
“With the Jeremy Lin press, it’s easier for [Amaker] to go to a kid and say, ‘Hey, if you have NBA aspirations, you can still get an education at the greatest school in the world and still fulfill your dream,’” Scarpa says.
And the alumni who hired him five years ago are thrilled with the decision they made.
“I’m very impressed with what Tommy’s done,” Carrabino says. “He’s a very hard-working guy, but he’s a good person. He’s done a wonderful job resurrecting the program, and I couldn’t be more pleased for him.”
Indeed, with the Crimson’s first NCAA tournament matchup since 1946 on the horizon, it appears that Tommy Amaker, the Friends of Harvard Basketball, and all those who have donned a Harvard uniform finally have a program that they are proud to call their own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police will be out in increased numbers to monitor underage drinking during the forbidden annual celebration of Housing Day, known as River Run, that will take place on Wednesday night before freshmen learn their House assignments the next morning.
In past years, students have commemorated River Run with unruly and dangerous behavior, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said, citing activities such as setting miniature boats on fire in the Charles River.
“We know that the Harvard Police will be out in force and that they have been asked to alert the Cambridge and state police,” Dingman said, calling River Run an “alleged tradition.”
The Crimson reported last year that the River Run festivities, which typically involve consuming large amounts of alcohol in addition to launching flaming crafts on the Charles, began in 2008.
Since 2010, the University has requested increased police presence each year on the night before Housing Day.
Dingman enumerated several reasons for freshmen to remain in the Yard on the perhaps anxious night before they learn their residential assignments but said that underage drinking causes the most concern for administrators.
Recalling the eves of Housing Days past, Dingman said, “People were taking chances and dodging traffic, which almost resulted in fatalities.”
He added, “Cambridge has gotten concerned, so there will be an increased police presence.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on precise staffing numbers, but he wrote in an email that the “Harvard University Police Department will be visible throughout the evening to ensure the safety of all students.”
Dingman said that foolhardy behavior would lead to harsh penalties.
“Should you choose to participate in the ‘River Run,’ be prepared to accept consequences related to your actions, including possible arrest and a case to be heard by the Administrative Board,” Dingman wrote in an email to the freshman class on Tuesday afternoon.
For some freshmen, academic deadlines would act as a deterrent to drinking on Wednesday night, regardless of the increased police presence.
“I have work, so it’s not even a consideration,” said Matt P. Sheets ’15, adding that many of his friend also have midterms this week.
In another measure aimed to prevent drinking, the First-Year Social Committee will host a “Last Night Black Light Dance” in Annenberg from 9 p.m. to midnight on Wednesday.
However, FYSC member and dance co-chair Christopher A. Smiles ’15 said the event is not purely meant to dissuade freshmen from participating in River Run.
“It’s kind of a balancing act. You want to provide a safe but fun alternative to River Run, but you don’t want to just cater to the people who want to do River Run,” Smiles said.
For him, the dance offers the opportunity to unite the Class of 2015 before the freshmen are divided up into twelve House communities.
“One of the big things we’re aiming for in this event is getting everyone together as a freshman class,” Smiles said. “This is our last night together as a class with no divisions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Allston Education Portal has become a source of conflict for the University and neighborhood residents now that Harvard has relaunched its development in Allston.
The Ed Portal, a community outreach center that provides programming for residents, was one of the most tangible benefits of Harvard’s involvement in Allston during the two tense years the University halted construction there.
But at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting last week, community members criticized Harvard’s decision to set the Ed Portal as the boundary for the development of the planned Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons.
Many said that they had expected that the retail and housing complex would be larger and that they felt that this demarcation was arbitrary. Brent C. Whelan ’73, who sits on the Task Force and lives in Allston, reiterated this idea in an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday.
“The current blueprint for Barry’s Corner is a lot denser than we anticipated,” Whelan said.
“It’s clear that if Barry’s Corner has to be squeezed into a two-acre setting, a lot of the imagined amenities, as well as the envisioned mission of the space, will be at risk.”
The Barry’s Corner complex, which will sit at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, marks a step toward achieving Harvard’s 2007 promise to transform Western Ave. into a “main street” environment.
This vision was put on hold when the University paused Allston development in 2009 after the economic recession sent its endowment tumbling.
Neighborhood residents said they appreciate the resources the Ed Portal provides but felt that an expanded Commons would outweigh the potential setbacks of relocating the Ed Portal.
“The Ed Portal is something that the community really wanted—it’s a great amenity,” Task Force member Paul Berkeley told The Crimson on Tuesday.
“But I don’t see why it necessarily has to be tied to that building—that building’s just sort of a warehouse.”
The University, however, defended its decision to halt development at the Portal, saying that moving might negatively affect the Portal’s programming and its “Learning Annex,” which is expected to open by the end of this year.
Kevin Casey, associate vice president for Harvard public affairs and communications, told residents at the meeting that the Ed Portal was a “significant investment” on the part of the University and could not be disassembled and recreated with ease.
Molecular and cellular biology professor Robert A. Lue, who is also the Ed Portal’s faculty adviser, echoed this sentiment in an interview with The Crimson.
“Being thrown out of the building would represent a problem for the various activities we provide for the community,” Lue said, emphasizing the importance of maintaining continuity for the more than 100 children who utilize Portal resources.
“Missing a whole season, or two seasons, could really interfere with their progress,” he said.
But residents were credulous of Harvard’s claims that moving the Ed Portal would be a cumbersome process.
“The Ed Portal’s demands are small,” Whelan said.
The development of the Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons is one of the University’s three major projects for its first phase of construction in Allston, as outlined by Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp in 2011.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting Tuesday night featured expressions of mutual love, in stark contrast to the contentious debate on free speech that marked the previous meeting.
A proposal to create a new Ph.D. program in Education, which is intended to bridge the gap between FAS professors and their colleagues at the Graduate School of Education, was met with adoration by faculty members.
Fourteen professors took to the microphone during the discussion on the proposal. After half a dozen expressed their “strong support” for the new program, Psychology Chair Susan Carey dubbed the whole affair a “lovefest.”
Then Government Chair Timothy J. Colton stood up. “I’d like to join the lovefest as well,” he said.
The term caught on, with nearly every professor after him participating in the “lovefest,” ¬or at least paying homage to it.
“I truly don’t wish to break up the lovefest,” said W. James Simpson, chair of the English department, prefacing his remarks.
Although he thought the proposal was “profoundly meditated and finely engineered,” Simpson suggested that sub-par educational quality in the United States may actually be a product of the rise of schools of education.
“My question is a big, bold, blunt question,” he said. “How do we account for the fact that the institutes of education have been around for 40 years, precisely in conjunction with the decline in education [quality]?”
Even when the faculty considered other proposals, the catchphrase remained a source of comic relief.
“I don’t expect it will instigate a lovefest,” said Sean D. Kelly, Philosophy department chair and Vice-Chair of the FAS Docket Committee, about his proposal to change the schedule of monthly faculty meetings. “But I hope it won’t instigate the opposite,” he added.
In fact, the change to the meeting calendar, considered a “substantive” point of business and hence open for “discussion only,” prompted no discussion at all.
Faculty will have to vote on the proposed schedule changes at a later meeting, a development which appeared to amuse University President Drew G. Faust.
“We do not vote on this today, but will return to the matter for a vote at or next meeting—in which case you have to explain it all over again?” she asked, turning to Kelly.
Though faculty will have to return to University Hall to vote on the proposals at a later date, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith invited them back to the faculty room in University Hall before that for a Dean’s Noontime Concert on Thursday, Mar. 22. Faculty will be the treated to Bartok and Hayden, performed by the Chiara String Quartet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An overwhelming majority of faculty agreed that Harvard must develop a Ph.D. program in education to stay on par with its peer institutions at Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
A proposal for the creation of a Standing Committee on Higher Degrees in Education “to admit and recommend candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education” was presented by Richard J. Tarrant, interim dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, at the meeting.
Almost a dozen professors lauded the initiative in a lengthy discussion, but not everyone was content to accept the proposal as it was.
The Ph.D. proposal was followed by a review of the concentration declaration deadline and the College’s secondary field program by Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate education.
Both policies were changed in 2006 and came up for a five-year evaluation this year.
Harris also announced that starting next fall, classes will be in session on Veteran’s Day though it will remain a staff holiday—a change that aligns with the calendar of the Law School and most of Harvard’s peer institutions.
THE STUDY OF TEACHING
A Ph.D. program in education, which would be jointly offered by the Graduate School of Education and FAS, would represent FAS’ seventeenth inter-school partnership in degree offerings—a development Tarrant called “historic.”
The Ph.D. program would have three specific concentrations, each built on an interdisciplinary framework.
“We’re the only major school of education that doesn’t offer a Ph.D.,” History Chair James T. Kloppenberg said, in support of the proposal.
Kloppenberg also cited the advantages the program will bring to Harvard’s recent commitment to teaching and learning.
“I’m astonished by how little most of our colleagues think about what’s actually going on in their classrooms,” he said. “By cementing these ties, we will have access to more information about pedagogy and student learning that will make us more effective in our classrooms.”
“This proposal is to me, as we say, a no-brainer,” economics professor Claudia Goldin said.
Despite the near-unanimous support that the proposal received from attendees, some faculty members present voiced concern over the Anglo-centric nature of the new committee and called for the incorporation of a more global perspective.
“I saw very little in the proposal that suggested the sort of cosmopolitan concerns that should be the business of this University,” anthropology professor Michael Herzfeld said, suggesting to Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney that the anthropology department, not included in the current proposal, could contribute positively to the program’s vision.
And according to classics professor Richard F. Thomas, the Ed School library does not support non-Anglophone research.
“Nowhere is the issue of increased [library] resources introduced,” Thomas said about the current proposal. “I think it’s our practice when we have incremental programs to build in the resources needed to support those programs.”
SECONDARY TIME AROUND
In a five-year review of the current system of concentration declaration and secondary fields, Harris and the Education Policy Committee proposed few changes to the existing procedures.
In 2006, the College changed the concentration deadline from the second to the third semester, as more than 30 percent of students were switching their concentrations and 5 percent more than once, Harris said.
“The idea was to give students more time to make well-informed decisions,” he said, adding that results from the senior surveys indicate that students are happier with the new schedule.
But according to one professor, some students are not as happy with guidelines on secondary fields. Although students cawn obtain more than one language citation, they are limited to a single secondary field.
“We wanted to preserve for students the flexibility to take a range of electives,” Harris said in defense of the policy, which the Education Policy  Committee did not recommend to change. “[Students] are free to take all their electives in a certain field, but to certify this as an achievement worthy of another brownie point or ribbon to wear, we did not see as serving any intellectual goal.”
Multiple professors also argued in support of stricter, earlier deadlines for declaring secondary fields so that smaller departments especially would have a better idea of student interest.
As of this Monday—the deadline to declare a secondary field—46 percent of the class of 2012 has declared a secondary field, up 14 percent since the class of 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If your father lived in Dunster, you’ll be greeted by a moose on Housing Day.
If your blocking group is on the small side, you’ll be Quadded.
Athletes are destined for Eliot.
Current Matthews residents are bound for Mather.
The children of celebrities and major donors can have their pick of the twelve Houses.
It’s the week of Housing Day at Harvard, and rumors are flying. As freshmen anxiously await the results of the lottery that will assign them to a House come Thursday morning, conspiracy theories abound.
Yet administrators assure students that  all of them are untrue. Today, they say, after generations of evolution, Harvard’s ethic of randomization in almost all cases means just that—random.
A CLICK OF THE BUTTON
Around the end of February of their first year at Harvard, freshmen form blocking groups of up to eight classmates, then submit their names online into the housing lottery.
This year, freshmen were required to turn in their blocking groups by 8 a.m. on Feb. 29.
The Office of Student Life, which runs the lottery, spent the rest of the day tracking down the roughly 10 freshmen who did not register on time.
Once all these freshmen were added to a blocking group or registered as floaters, the OSL officially closed the lottery.
Next, the OSL pre-placed the blocking groups of students who registered disabilities ranging from mobility impairment to carpet allergies with the Accessible Education Office into a House that could accommodate their needs. This year, the OSL also randomly assigned a blocking group containing the child of House Masters into one of the nine Houses outside his parents’ neighborhood.
The OSL then determined the number of incoming sophomores that each House could accommodate based on expected attrition.
Finally, at 10:50 a.m. on March 2, Sophia R. Chaknis, the director of residential programs and operations, put on her Sorting Hat—actually donning a Harry Potter prop—then turned to the lottery software on her computer and clicked a button that randomly assigned about 1,600 freshmen to the buildings most of them will live in for the next three years.
“It’s literally just clicking a button,” said Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh.
Specially designed by Harvard University Information Technology, the lottery tool meddles only with gender ratio.
In each freshman class, the ratio of male and female students placed in any House cannot stray from the current gender balance in that House by more than 15 percent.
Once the simple mathematical algorithm spit out the housing assignments, the OSL checked the results to “be sure the lottery logic is performing correctly,” McIntosh said. It has never failed them so far, he noted.
Finally, the Housing Day letters were generated. The fateful pages waited, ready to be picked up by upperclassmen to deliver on Housing Day morning.
McIntosh said the OSL receives about one or two phone calls after each Housing Day from students or parents who are concerned about housing assignments.
ENTROPY
The housing assignment process has become increasingly less grounded in student choice since University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, established Harvard’s residential House system in the 1930s.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 recalls that when he was an undergraduate, housing assignments were made through a competitive interview process in which House Masters selected interested freshmen.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 remembers of the House Masters’ selection logic, “If you had a string quartet that was part of the tradition of your House, you better make sure you have a cello.”
But in the 1970s, the policy changed. Students began ranking all the Houses in order of preference, taking the House Masters’ will out of the equation.
This shift came about as part of a “general movement toward student empowerment and student involvement,” Lewis said.
By the end of the decade, administrators modified the policy to limit students to ranking their top four Houses.
Under this revised system, students who received poor lottery numbers were sometimes unable to get into any of their top four choices and were instead randomly assigned to a House that still had vacancies—often in the Quad.
To avoid this fate, students sometimes sought to game the system by employing the strategy that Dingman remembers as the “Quad buster.”
According to Dingman, these students would apply to River Houses that they perceived as less popular to ensure that they would not be exiled to the Quad.
But for some, in particular African-American students, the Quad was the top choice.
Lewis recalls that African-American students told him that by choosing the Quad, they intended to make “a statement of being in but not of Harvard.”
In 1990, due to concerns about students self-segregating in certain Houses, administrators shifted to a non-ordered four-choice system.
But the composition of the Houses did not change.
The 1994 Report on the Structure of Harvard College, written by a committee which Lewis co-chaired, stated, “Our Committee is troubled that pronounced variations in the populations of the various Houses—with some Houses still having disproportionate numbers of varsity athletes, or members of certain ethnic or religious groups—result in those students being, as one person put it,‘educationally deprived’ because they have contact only with a somewhat homogeneous group of their peers.”
In 1996, The Crimson reported that only 4.8 percent of Eliot, Winthrop, and Kirkland residents were African-American, as opposed to 24.6 percent of residents of the Quad Houses.
After he took over as dean of the College in 1995, Lewis took over an effort begun his predecessor L. Fred Jewett ’57 to transition to a fully randomized housing lottery process.
The student-choice system “allowed the Masters and the House administrations and the College...to avoid problems that were problems of a minority of the Harvard population if that minority was underrepresented in their own House,” Lewis said.
This problem, Lewis recalls, was reflected in the sentiment expressed by some that homosexual students belonged in Adams.
Lewis recalls being disturbed by statements to the effect: “‘Oh, you’re gay and you’re unhappy. Well, why don’t you go to Adams House? They can probably take care of you.’”
In the spring of 1996, the first class of freshmen received letters assigning them to Houses which they had had no say at all in selecting.
Administrators tinkered with the system to add gender controls in 1997 and to reduce the maximum size of blocking groups from 16 to 8 in 2000.
Explaining the justification for the current eight-student rule, McIntosh mused, “Eight is enough for students to feel like they’re probably going to have maybe two or three suites, depending on the size of the rooming groups, of friends, and they’ll have other friends in the House, but at the same time, we won’t end up with floors or entryways of just a peer group. It seemed kind of arbitrary, and in some ways, it is, because what’s the difference between seven or nine?”
But other than those adjustments, administrators say that the existing fully randomized process has seen little change in the past decade and a half because it has effectively forced every student to confront diversity in his or her House.
As Lewis sees it, his experiment worked. “Randomization had the effect of making any problem everyone’s problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was met by a cheering crowd of supporters in his home state on Tuesday night as he celebrated victories in a host of Super Tuesday primaries.
Of the ten states weighing in on the Republican presidential nominating race on Tuesday, Romney won six, including Massachusetts, but political analysts said Romney still failed to separate himself from the pack of Republican contenders.
Romney’s victories in Idaho, Massachusetts, Ohio, Virginia, Vermont, and Wyoming on Tuesday will bring key delegates to his campaign.
But his loss in Tennessee and narrow margin of victory in Ohio over Senator Rick Santorum, who won three states’ contests on Tuesday, rendered the night a wash in the eyes of many.
Romney also failed once again to win any Southern states, an indicator that political analysts point to as a sign of his continued trouble with the Republican base.
“If you’re a Republican wondering about Romney’s viability, you still have those doubts,” Institute of Politics Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said of Tuesday’s results. “Romney’s still a frontrunner, but he’s a very weak one.”
The story is a familiar one, pundits said. Romney has been the assumed Republican frontrunner since the primary process began in January, yet he has failed at nearly every step to convince party voters he should be their representative on the national stage.The tone at Tuesday’s election night event was upbeat, with a crowd of supporters young and old chanting “We want Mitt! We want Mitt!”
Flanked by his wife and grandchildren, an energized Romney addressed a group of former constituents, thanking them for his victories thus far and reflecting on the weeks and months to come until the general election.
“I’m not going to lie; it’s been a long road to Super Tuesday,” Romney told his supporters.
“There will be good days and bad days, always long hours and never enough time. But on November 6, we will stand united—not only having won an election but having saved a future,” he added.
Super Tuesday is considered the biggest test of the primary season to date. A total of 419 delegates were up for grabs nationwide on Tuesday—a little more than a third of 1,144 needed to earn the Republican nomination.
Analysts said that Romney’s indecisive showing, coupled with Santorum’s continued strong performance, will likely draw the race out well into June.
In the absence of key victories, the night was about Massachusetts. Romney’s speech at the Westin Hotel in downtown Boston marked the first time the candidate has been home in two months. Though energized when talking to the crowd, he looked physically tired, with his eyes downcast or lost in the room, as his wife Ann addressed the crowd.
Romney won in Massachusetts by a landslide, taking home over 70 percent of the vote and all of the state’s 41 delegates.
Romney’s victory in his home state was expected by analysts, who said anything short of a blowout here would have been a major disappointment to the campaign.
Romney served as governor of the state from 2003 to 2007 and is a graduate of Harvard Law and Business School.
“It’s a coronation of Mitt in his main home state,” Republican consultant Todd Domke wrote in an email before the vote tallies came in. “The other candidates didn’t contest him here, so the outcome has never been in question.”

The work of a cartoonist is unique because “one graphic can tell a story,” said Lawrence R. “Larry” Gonick ’67, a Harvard mathematics student who went on to dedicate his career to depicting big ideas through comics.
Gonick, who has worked as a cartoonist since the 1970s, has published cartoon guides to teach concepts in disciplines as diverse as politics, history, mathematics, life science, sex, and tax reform.
His first major publication, “The Cartoon History of the Universe” describes billions of years in 380 pages of illustrations.
His newest work, “The Cartoon Guide to Calculus,” was released earlier this year.
“Comics can use different techniques to represent complicated information,” Gonick said as he showed slides of his own work and the work of cartoonists who influenced his style.
He continued that cartoons can make pages of dense information more enjoyable by allowing the reader to better connect with the material.
“Our neural circuitry wants [us] to see cartoons,” Gonick said, citing a MIT study which found that people recognized cartoon illustrations of famous faces more quickly than actual photographs.
The clarity and conceptual accuracy of Gonick’s work has aided students both young and old.
“In order to understand a unit in biology, my oldest son and his friend used Gonick’s book on genetics,” said community member Tadeck Gaj. “The book helped them clarify some points.”
Gaj’s 11-year-old son Cormac added that the comics are “very funny.”
Benjamin Y. Zhou ’15 said that he has greatly enjoyed Gonick’s cartoon guides for their clarity and wit since he was introduced to them by his sixth grade history teacher.
While Gonick acknowledged that his work has been criticized for having too much anthropomorphism, he stressed that the strategy is useful as long as readers understand that he is not being literal when he writes that something inanimate “wants” to do something.
Despite this criticism, Gonick’s work has been adopted by academics as an educational tool.
“At first I had professional skepticism towards Gonick’s [Cartoon Guide to Statistics],” said Statistics Department Chair Xiao-Li Meng.
“But now I have adopted it as the only reference book for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 16,” Meng said.

Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School serving a two-year sentence in his native Azerbaijan on charges that he avoided military service, was denied parole in an appellate court last week.
His supporters—including many Kennedy School students and faculty—contend that the government detained Hajiyev in March 2011 on false charges in order to silence his work calling attention to election fraud and corruption in the national government.
After earning a Masters in Public Policy degree from the Kennedy School in 2009, Hajiyev returned to Azerbaijan to run for Parliament and pursue a Ph.D. in the neighboring Republic of Georgia.
While men between the ages of 18 and 35 are liable for military service of at least a year in Azerbaijan, studying abroad and running for Parliament both typically allow men to receive postponement of draft duties, according to Hajiyev’s supporters.
After several run-ins with authorities, Hajiyev was detained in Feb. 2011 and again in March of that year for his involvement on Facebook in protests against government corruption and election fraud.
When he was arrested the second time on charges of draft evasion, he was allegedly questioned about his inflammatory publications on Facebook.
Many in the international community have been critical of the motives behind Hajiyev’s arrest.
“Bakhtiyar Hajiyev’s arrest has all the hallmarks of the harassment and intimidation the Azerbaijani authorities all too often resort to in respect of government critics,” Amnesty International Europe and Central Asia Deputy Programme Director John Dalhuisen said.
“As a registered student and a parliamentary candidate, he is doubly excused from military service, and he quite clearly should not have been detained on these grounds.”
Amnesty International and other groups, including Human Rights Watch, have decried Hajiyev’s treatment at the hands of Azerbaijani authorities. Police officers have allegedly beaten, strangled, and threatened to rape him while in custody, according to Amnesty International.
The embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan did not respond to requests for comment.
A year after Hajiyev’s incarceration, the Harvard community continues to protest his imprisonment. Kennedy School Executive Dean John A. Haigh and numerous Harvard professors wrote a letter to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on Hajiyev’s behalf, and more than 500 students and community members signed a petition addressed to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calling for his immediate release.
“Our training at Harvard is focused on advancing the public interest, and Bakhtiyar has dedicated his life to fostering democracy in Azerbaijan,” said Rob Ness, a Kennedy School classmate of Hajiyev’s. “Our partnerships abroad should be based on a mutual commitment to democracy, human rights, and freedom of dissent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 8, 2012, at 3:08 a.m.
Two Harvard professors will serve on the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced on Monday.
Graduate School of Education professor Fernando M. Reimers and Law School professor David J. Barron ’89 will join the Board, which is charged with defining the mission and overseeing the operation of Massachusetts’ system of public higher education, according to the Department of Higher Education’s website.
“David and Fernando both understand the critical role higher education plays in preparing our students to succeed in the 21st century global economy,” Patrick said in a release. “They will bring diversity and depth of experience to the board to ensure every student in Massachusetts has access to a world-class, affordable higher education.”
Both professors said that they will bring the perspectives of their academic expertise to their work on the Board.
Reimers’ current research focuses on educational innovation and the impact of policy, leadership, and teacher professional development on student outcomes.
“I’ve always been interested in public service and have had a number of engagements with education,” Reimers said. “When the governor’s office invited me to serve in this capacity, I was extremely pleased. It’s an honor to help improve our state’s institutions.”
Barron focuses his work on state and local government law.
“I think this is an incredibly important time in higher education in Massachusetts,” said Barron. “These institutions will play a role in preparing our residents for a future that increasingly depends on having high-quality and affordable higher education.”
Barron and Reimers both said that strengthening community colleges and facilitating integration of schools across the system would become important issues for the Board going forward.
For example, Reimers said that Massachusetts should move towards a system like California’s, which facilitates students’ ability to transfer between schools.
“If you begin in a community college and transition to another institution, a lot of your work will be recognized,” Reimer said. “It doesn’t function like that yet in Massachusetts, but we are moving in that direction.”
Barron and Reimers will serve as two of the eleven voting members of the Board, which also has two non-voting student advisors. In addition to general advocacy on behalf of the institutions, the Board of Higher Education’s duties include academic policy program approval, financial aid, fiscal planning, research, and workforce development.
“As a citizen of Harvard University, I think we have a special obligation to the many communities of which the University is a part,” Reimers said. “Universities can be engines of social and economic innovation, and they improve lives in the communities of which they are a part.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 9
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that neither Fernando M. Reimers nor David J. Barron '89 has yet been sworn in to the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education. In fact, Barron has already been sworn in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in 66 years, the Harvard men’s basketball team is going dancing.
Indeed, there will be no dramatic one-game playoff for the right to go to the NCAA tournament; there will be no co-champions this year.
Thanks to Princeton’s 62-52 victory over Penn Tuesday night, the Crimson has won the first outright Ivy title in program history and will be participating in March Madness for the first time since 1946.
Harvard’s seniors—who had worked for this moment since buying into a vision laid out by coach Tommy Amaker, who recruited them following an 8-22 season in 2007-08—could not be more thrilled.
“Oh my God, this is crazy, this is absolutely crazy,” co-captain Keith Wright said. “You have no idea how excited I am. I’ve been running for 30 minutes, in the freezing cold, screaming at the top of my lungs.”
With a victory at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium, the Quakers could have clinched a share of the title and forced a one-game playoff, which would have been held Saturday at Quinnipiac University
But the Tigers—who topped the Crimson on a Doug Davis buzzer-beater in last year’s Ivy playoff—made another such play-in game unnecessary.
“I’m with the guys in the Quad, and we all got together to watch," sophomore wing Laurent Rivard said. "We’re just having fun right now; we’re really excited that this happened for the first time in 66 years.”
It has been a season marked by firsts for the Crimson, which won its first-ever tournament at the Battle 4 Atlantis over Thanksgiving break and earned its first-ever Top 25 ranking in December.
The overwhelming preseason favorite, Harvard was expected to finally represent the Ancient Eight in the Big Dance this year after falling just short in 2010-11. After the squad went 16-2 heading into the meat of conference play, such a feat looked even more inevitable. But the Crimson slipped up twice against its Ancient Eight rivals, falling, 70-62, at Princeton on Feb. 11 and losing, 55-54, at home to Penn two weeks later.
The Quakers victory and two home wins last weekend put Penn in position to clinch a share of the title Tuesday night, but Princeton held Quakers star Zack Rosen to just 8-of-24 shooting and received 18 points from forward Ian Hummer to help it break the hearts of its archrival.
Now, instead of playing Saturday, Harvard will await its fate on Selection Sunday, when it will find out its tournament seed, opponent, and destination. As of Tuesday night, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi currently has projected Harvard as an 11-seed.
Before the season, co-captain Oliver McNally said partaking in March Madness was the squad's goal and a personal dream.
“I'm a die-hard college basketball fan; I have been my whole life,” McNally explained. “I think the greatest sporting event in the world is the NCAA Tournament, hands down, and obviously I want to play in it one time before my time is up.”
In his senior year, after helping Harvard emerge from two close road games with wins at Columbia and Cornell last weekend, McNally will finally be getting the chance to dance.
The evening also brought a long-awaited return to the tournament for  Amaker, who last reached March Madness as coach of Seton Hall in 2000  and was unsuccessful in bringing Michigan to the Dance during his  six-year tenure there.
“We are thrilled and honored to have an opportunity to compete in  the  2012 NCAA tournament,” Amaker said in  statement. “This is a  tremendous moment for  Harvard University, our basketball program and  our community. Go  Crimson!”
The last time Harvard was a part of March Madness, the tournament consisted of just eight teams, ten total games, and two sites: Kansas City and New York City. The Crimson, representing New England, was eliminated following a 46-38 first-round loss to Ohio State, and also fell, 67-61, to NYU in its region's third-place consolation game.
This time around, the tournament will be 60 teams larger, and Harvard could end up playing its first-round game on March 15 or 16 in one of eight cities ranging from Pittsburgh to Portland.
But no matter where it ends up, the Crimson will be ready for the challenge that lies ahead.
“Now that we’re in the tournament, we can’t stop working,” Rivard said. “We want to advance.... That’s the next goal.”

As the Crimson men’s basketball team anxiously awaited its destiny in the result of the Ivy title determining Penn-Princeton match, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (2-1, 0-1 Ivy) took its fate in its own hands, earning a double-overtime victory over No. 13 James Madison (3-2) Tuesday afternoon.
The 9-8 finish was the first overtime win the Crimson has garnered in two years, with the last coming in a 10-9 victory over New Hampshire in March of 2010.
A scoreless preliminary overtime forced the teams into a second overtime period. But this time, it was sudden death.
“We knew the next draw control was going to be huge,” said junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault.
With the clock reset at three minutes Tetreault quickly controlled the draw—tallying Harvard’s 13th of 21 draw controls in the contest against the Dukes— and the Crimson’s offense took shape.
A James Madison foul provided senior co-captain Melanie Baskind a free-position shot on goal from the eight-meter, and a chance to win the game, only to have it miss wide.
But Harvard maintained its composure and was able to connect a string of passes, setting-up a second scoring opportunity in the do-or-die situation. Tetreault found the back of the net with 1:39 remaining in the second overtime period to give the Crimson the win over the Dukes after more than 72 total minutes of play.
“It was all about off-ball movement—because of the movement, a lane cleared and I was able to take [the final shot],” Tetreault said.
Tetreault‘s game-winning goal was the fifth game-winner of her career and her fourth goal of the season. The midfielder also contributed a game-high five draw controls against James Madison.
“We can always trust Danielle in those situations,” Baskind said. “She looked confident with the ball in her hand, and she pulled a great move on the goalie…. It was a good feeling to put a cap on [the game].”
Senior Jess Halpern also logged a record-setting game, scoring her 116th career goal off of a hat trick in the match, and moving into the seventh spot in the rankings of most hat tricks in Harvard history and into the ninth all-time for the school in career points with a total of 138 goals.
The win comes off the heels of a 12-6 conference loss to Ancient Eight rival, Cornell, on Saturday afternoon.
“It was an important win for us bouncing back from Cornell,” Baskind said. “We spent a lot of time talking about what went wrong and things that we wanted to fix. And there was an excitement for [Tuesday’s] game that hadn’t been there for the previous two.”
The Crimson seized control of the game against the Dukes from the first whistle with back-to-back goals from Halpern and Baskind, just 3:46 into the match. James Madison bounced back with a pair of its own goals, leveling the score at two before Halpern and senior Tyler Petropulos answered with a one-two punch within 50 seconds of each other, recapturing a two-goal advantage.
A big save by rookie goalie Kelly Weis opened the door for Halpern to find the back of the net for the third time in the opening period, giving Harvard a 5-2 edge. The Dukes diminished the deficit before the half, notching two goals to end the frame, making it a tight 5-4 match.
Harvard struck early in the second half, re-establishing a two-goal advantage with a tally from Baskind. The Crimson and James Madison exchanged goals to make it 6-5 before Petropulos, with assists from sophomore Chelsey Newman, was able to widen it to a three goal gap—its largest of the match—with two of her own scores.
But the Dukes were not ready to bow out just yet.
James Madison lit up the scoreboard with three unanswered goals to send the game into the first of two overtimes, the tying score connecting with the net with just 28 seconds remaining in regulation play.
Harvard’s 15 turnovers on the day—more than twice as many as its opponents—allowed the Dukes to convert and close the gap between the two teams.
“Turnovers definitely hurt us,” Baskind said. “It’s something we’ve been struggling with and we need to continue to work on.”
But the Crimson didn’t let the late stalemate kill its momentum.
“We knew it wasn’t over. They scored the goal to tie, they were the ones fighting back,” Tetreault said.
Both teams struggled to score in the first overtime period—despite three on-goal attempts from Harvard—extending the contest into a second overtime period.
But this time, the Crimson put an end to the drought and secured the victory, with Tetreault’s game-winnning goal scored with 1:39 left on the clock.
The duo of Petropulos and Halpern led Harvard’s scoring with a hat trick each, while Baskind performed on both sides of the field, contributing two goals to the Crimson’s cause and logging a game-high three ground balls.

Harvard women’s basketball had already clinched second place in the Ivy League and a bid to the WNIT—Tuesday night’s game didn’t matter.
But it seems that nobody told junior Emma Golen that.
Golen, with a career-high 21 points, led her team past Dartmouth (6-22, 4-10 Ivy) and to a 74-69 win to finish off regular season play, Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion, marking the team’s fourth consecutive victory, both overall and at home, for the Crimson.
The junior not only led Harvard (17-11, 10-4) in points, but also in rebounds and assists, nabbing eight and five, respectively. The latter was another career-high for Golen, breaking her previous record of four.
“She was fabulous tonight,” coach Cathy Delaney-Smith said. “In the locker room, when I talk to them about taking too many threes, I say with the exception of Emma Golen. I tell her that if she is open, to please take the three. I wanted Emma to have the green light.”
Golen stated that she wasn’t aware of breaking her career high, but joked of her coach’s strong influence.
“[How many points I scored] wasn’t really on my mind,” Golen said. “But [Delaney-Smith] told me if I didn’t shoot when I was open she would kill me, so that was definitely in the back of my mind.”
The night on the whole was a game of runs. After taking an initial 8-0 lead, the Crimson found itself in an eight-point deficit with 3:26 left in the first half. But thanks to a layup and jumper from Golen and a basket by sophomore Elise Gordon, Harvard was able to cut into the Big Green’s lead and trailed only 36-34 at halftime.
The second half could only be described as more of the same. Within six and a half minutes, the Crimson had regained momentum and completed an 11-0 run to earn a 10-point advantage. Golen hit a three and scored an and-one consecutively during the run, breaking her career high with over 17 minutes left to play in the process. Harvard’s lead would grow to a game-high of 16 until, once again, Dartmouth fought back.
With 9:51 remaining, the Big Green’s Nicola Zimmer threw up a shot from long-range, cutting the Crimson advantage down to thirteen. Her jumper was followed by two more threes from her teammates, forcing a Harvard timeout with the score at 60-53.
Two minutes later, it was a four-point game. But then co-captain Brogan Berry and sophomore Christine Clark started to do what they do best: drive.
Following a Dartmouth and-one, Berry went coast-to-coast, taking it into the paint and making the layup. Next, Clark stole the ball and, following her teammate’s lead, pushed it up the floor, ultimately drawing the foul. She promptly sunk two free throws, extending her team’s lead to eight points with 5:23 remaining in the period.
The game’s twists weren’t over yet. In the last two minutes, the Big Green hit three more jumpers, including the team’s eighth three-pointer. It would take six more points from Berry and Clark to secure the win for the Crimson.
Berry emphasized the importance that this late-game aggression held in the victory.
“You think you can either just go through the game, or you can try to get things done,” Berry explained. “That’s one of my strengths, driving to the basket, whether it is driving to score for myself or driving to create. It was something we needed to do—we needed to get some penetration.”
Despite the offensive success, Harvard’s defense down the stretch was much more of a detriment to the Crimson. Dartmouth’s 69 points wer the most that a Harvard opponent had scored since the team’s 74-44 loss at Princeton in February.
“I thought there were stretches of brilliance and stretches of ‘What was that?’” Delaney-Smith said. “It was inexplicable some of the defensive errors and breakdowns that we had. That’s what I found a little frustrating or disappointing. I always want to play well and win, so just winning? I can’t be rah-rah about just that.”
On the night, Berry broke several more Crimson and Ivy League records. Among these were most starts in program history (113), a tie for second-most assists in Harvard history (517) and fourth-most assists in Ivy League history.
According to Golen, the fact that the game did not have direct implications on Ivy standings may have been a positive factor, but, nevertheless, it did not diminish the emotional importance of the win for the team.
“We’re going to come out playing the same game even though we knew that there was no pressure on us,” Golen explained. “We knew it wasn’t a ‘We have to win this game or we’re out’ situation, so I think that helped us. It was [Berry and co-captain Lindsay Louie’s] last home game ever, so we really wanted to give them the win. We wanted to do it for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the start of the 2011 season, Harvard coach Joe Walsh had high expectations for his team.
“I’m not going to give you any ‘we’re cautiously optimistic’ or anything,” he said at the time. “We’re good. We’re good right now.”
But despite a promising preseason, the Crimson baseball team struggled throughout the year, dropping four games right off the bat (pun intended) against Jacksonville State. The trip down South ushered in a rough year, as Harvard finished the 2011 campaign with a record of 9-36 and a 5-15 mark in Ivy play—the program’s worst performance since the team went 1-8 in 1918.
If you glace quickly at the Crimson’s 2012 record so far—0-3 after the first weekend of play—this season appears to be off to a similarly dismal start. But there’s reason to believe that things might be a bit different this year.
For one, the three early losses came at the hands of No. 7 Arizona, a team that entered its weekend matchup against the Crimson with seven games and five wins under its belt. Not to mention the fact that the Wildcats have played all of those contests in the comforts of home turf at Hi Corbett Field.
Arizona’s 8-2 overall record includes one loss each in a pair of three-game series against North Dakota and Auburn. The Wildcats have scored 74 runs in their first 10 games, amassing a .434 slugging percentage.
And because Arizona’s location is more conducive to playing baseball in February than, say, Cambridge—as well as the existence of fewer rules governing when a season can start in the Pac-12 as opposed to the Ivy League—the gap between the two squads shouldn’t come as that much of a shock.
Perhaps a sign of early-season growing pains, errors plagued the Crimson in its first weekend of play; the team racked up 10 of them on its way to three straight losses in as many days, 7-1, 3-1, and 13-2.
But there were several positive takeaways as well, particularly in the second game of the series. Led by junior right-handed pitcher Joey Novak, who threw three scoreless innings before surrendering two runs in the fourth, Harvard matched up well against the Wildcats—the Crimson even loaded the bases while down 2-1 but couldn’t capitalize on the opportunity.
Another bright spot is that Harvard’s freshman class appears to have transitioned smoothly to the college game. Rookie Brandon Kregel hit a homer in his first career start, scoring the only run the Crimson would tally in its season opener. In the second game, another freshman, Mike Martin, scored—again the Crimson’s only run of that particular contest. Classmate Jacob Kremers started on the mound in Harvard’s final contest against the Wildcats, playing three innings and striking out one batter while surrendering three runs.
That said, the next few games of the season will be key for Harvard. Last year, the Crimson dropped its first nine, entering Ivy play with an overall record of 3-16. And that hole proved to be a deficit from which Harvard would not recover, as the team finished at the bottom of the Rolfe Division for the first time since 2008.
Needless to say, Harvard enters 2012 with a lot to prove.
Luckily for the Crimson, the team has plenty of time to shake off the dust. And what better way to do that than by training and playing in balmy 60- or 70-degree weather in front of crowds as large as 2,187 (the total attendance at Saturday’s game—and the other games’ numbers weren’t that far behind).
Harvard is slated for 13 more games before it travels to Ithaca, N.Y., on March 31 to take on Cornell in its first Ivy contest of 2012. And the Crimson won’t play at O’Donnell Field until Boston College journeys across town on April 4.
For now, the only thing on Harvard’s mind is its spring break trip down South, starting with its upcoming four-game matchup with Stetson March 9-12.
Despite the minor setback against Arizona, the Crimson has a lot to be excited about as it continues its longest away stretch of the season. And although there is still a lot of baseball to be played, I’m—to borrow Walsh’s catchphrase—“cautiously optimistic” about 2012.

Behind its double doors lies Eliot House, coming in at number two on Flyby's Housing rankings this year! Founded as one of the seven original Houses in 1931, the House had a reputation as the 'Prep' House, home to Harvard's elite and wealthy, before housing became randomized. It is named after Charles William Eliot, President of the University from 1869-1909, and is known for its prominence on the water, both in IM crew and in river accessibility. Never falling below fifth in any category in the poll, Eliot is truly a House to be proud of this Housing Day.
House Spirit: Ranking at second place in House spirit, Eliot is beaten only by Dunster in its self-love. The House motto, worn proudly on tees and sweatshirts galore, is "Domus,"—the name of upper class housing in ancient Rome—and quite fitting for what used to be home of the elites. "The best thing about Eliot is the friendliness and love of the staff, tutors, and house masters that is simply contagious," said one resident, or, as another put it, "DOMUS!"
 
Housing Quality: Room quality is Eliot's weakest feature, coming in at fifth on the poll, which still puts it ahead of seven other Houses. N-housing for sophomores is counterbalanced with "excellent junior and senior housing with a (relatively) transparent housing lottery," making the remaining part of Eliotite's Harvard experiences quite comfortable. "The rooming arrangements are so flexible because of the architecture and the fire doors" says one commenter, presumably an optimist, who turns the sometimes troublesome fire doors into a positive as-one-door-closes-another-door-opens type thing. Also, one commenter had this to say: "Those quadlings talk about square footage—talk through your crises and joys with those extra 5 sq inches." 
 
Dining Hall: High ceilinged, well-lit, and spacious, Eliot d-hall is one of the House's crown jewels, landing fourth in the poll. "The dining hall is the bomb diggity," said one commenter, which explains why "the d-hall is a really social place where you get to make friends with other Eliotites." Come here for brain break and you'll find "loads of people" hanging out and studying. Sometimes this appeal of the d-hall can be hard on residents as well—"we are too perfect" complained one responder. Regardless, the food is above average, according to residents and outsiders alike. Also, Sunday Brunch, delicious at all Houses, features a piano in this stately d-hall.
 
Facilities: Ultimately, what sets Eliot apart from the other Houses are its facilities and location. Already on prime riverfront property, Eliot residents get the added bonus of having swipe access to Eliot gate. Athletes enjoy an easier route to the athletic complex year round, and other students enjoy the gate for various reasons as well, including drunkenly on Harvard-Yale game day. Although a House gym and library aren't unique to Eliot, the House also boasts a theater (the Golden Arm), a courtyard and patio, dance studio, darkroom, erg room, bell tower, a newly renovated and little-known grille and common room, and even a woodshop. To sum up: "Exceptional variety of facilities in a beautifully-designed and well-maintained house. This House has flash AND substance."
 
Rating: Eliot is an all-around strong House, with good rooming, a beautiful dining hall, and a close-knit community. For these reasons, it ranked second out of 12. Best of luck to freshmen out there, and just remember: this year, if there's an elephant in the room, it's a good thing.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
Laying claim to the number one spot in this year's rankings, Kirkland has plenty of perks: a plethora of House traditions including the ever-infamous Incestfest, adorable House Masters with even more adorable dogs, a world record in its courtyard, and a location close to class, Noch's, and the MAC. Kirkland is one of Harvard's smallest Houses, so freshmen, beware—it won't be easy to get in, but if you do, you'll never want to leave.
House Spirit: Kirkland residents are incredibly close—some might say too close, particularly on a certain morning in December. Survey responses on the perks of Kirkland life were fairly evenly distributed between Incestfest, Secret Santa Week, and "EVERYTHING." Spirit is strong thanks to the many events Kirklanders look forward to year after year: the House also runs an annual "Humans vs. Zombies" tournament, plays host to the Cultural Rhythms Artist of the Year, offers the ever-popular Wine Seminar, and runs a Case Day with nothing to do with consulting. Their sweetest tradition, though, is Boat Club, when residents gather weekly on Sundays for milk and freshly baked cookies. Perhaps due to horror non-residents feel at the cult-like nature of the House, Kirkland placed eighth in House spirit.
Housing Quality: Rooming is Kirkland's weakest link. Rooms tend to be on the smaller side, with some DeWolfe housing available for overflow, no guaranteed singles, and of course the river pests we try not to think about. DeWolfe housing tends to be the best rooming available for sophomores, but at several blocks away, it can keep them isolated from House life. One resident lamented, "Some seniors don't get N+1 housing, which is a travesty. But I do." All this, of course, has to do with the downside of small rooms and walkthroughs. The rooms themselves, however, retain an elegant old-Harvard aesthetic, with marble staircases in the entryways, window ledges, wooden floors, and brick fireplaces, making the rooms themselves cozy and quaint. For all this, Kirkland placed seventh in housing quality.
Dining Hall: Kirkland's dining hall is the smallest on the river, and it shows (in a good way.) The dining hall is sunny, the staff is friendly, and the small, café style tables are napkin dispenser free, thanks to an aesthetic movement on the part of the House Masters. To those from outside Kirkland, don't be alarmed if students suddenly break out in the House's very own Kirkland Ode midway through a meal. Sharing a kitchen with neighbor Eliot, whose dining hall placed fourth, Kirkland's came out just ahead, placing third in poll rankings.
Facilities: Kirkland is lacking in meeting rooms, but more than makes up for it with its dark wood-paneled JCR, which is decked out with a grandiose carving above the fireplace and two pianos, though it is sadly bookable only for House events. Hicks House, that white house you might have walked by on JFK St., serves as the House's library and dates back to 1762. Open only to Kirkland residents, the library is one of the House's hidden treasures.
Rating: Thanks to the cult of John Thornton Kirkland, Kirkland places first in this year's rankings. Granted, this might also have something to do with the prime location, cozy dining hall, and cozier community, but either way, keep your fingers crossed for a piece of this prime real estate.

In the pre-Housing Day flurry, several Houses have begun rolling out promotional tumblr blogs. Cabot House's tumblr features its mascot, the Cabot Fish, planking in front of various Harvard hotspots such as the steps of Memorial Church, the doorway of The Crimson, and even the Sanders stage before an Ec 10 lecture. Lowell, too, launched a tumblr, which rides on the coattails of the Harvard meme trend with images featuring captions like: "Significant other got quadded / Long distance relationship."
Cabot and Lowell aren't the first to consider using tumblr as a platform. Last year, Currier House started an official blog to centralize its Housing Day videos, songs, and other miscellanea. However, Currier's blog hasn't been updated since 2011. Same goes for Pfoho, as they also had a tumblr last year that hasn't been updated since.
Cabot's tumblr diverges from the norm a little in its unwavering good cheer. Unlike the snarky taglines posted on the Lowell tumblr or Pfoho's sarcastic Sh*t River People Say video, Cabot sticks to pretty, soft-focus photos of the Quad.
"We wanted another way that was eco-friendly and easy for freshman to learn about our house," said Jillian M. Smith '14, who worked on the tumblr.
"A lot of people don't know things about Cabot.  You don't hear from Cabot a lot," added Laura S. Hinton '13, the tumblr's creator. The new Cabot blog is certainly eye-catching, with pages after pages of images featuring the Cabot Fish, in all his friendly, red and yellow splendor.
Will the Cabot tumblr usher in a new age of friendlier Housing Day festivities? Perhaps. But we're skeptical.

Have you spotted this cow around Harvard Sqaure? If so, that's probably because he's actively training for the 2012 Boston Marathon. Underneath the costume is Christopher F. Allison '12, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator who is aiming to raise $5,000 for pediatric cancer research and treatment at the Mass General Hospital for Children. Allison has partnered up with JP Licks, and in exchange for support from the ice cream shop has agreed to train for the marathon and eventually run the marathon in full cow suit garb. Keep your eyes peeled for this do-good cow!
