After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, like any other, a majority of American high-school seniors will apply to college. A majority of them will be admitted. A majority of them will attend college in the fall of 2021. And a minority — a very, very small minority — will have their admission revoked for misbehavior on social media, ex post facto. But why?
Some cases involving criminal behavior warrant the decision to rescind. Others do not. And like super-parents, admission committees can see everything, in a digital age, and punish everyone for anything from speech to incitement, civil disobedience to criminality, structural racism to a temporary glitch in one’s character.
In Plato’s “Apology,” Socrates laughably suggests that if he is guilty of corrupting the youth and bringing in new gods, the fitting punishment is public support: free food and drink while he tries to improve his soul through dialectical exercises. For the Class of 2025, the answer might be: Bar them from the quad.
This fall has the potential to be a particularly important inflection point in the admissions question. We can watch every student, all the time. But perhaps it's time to try out an alternative: a general, social media amnesty for the speech of rising students who came of age during the spring of COVID-19 and widespread protests. Selective punishment of social media is not likely to target the worst of the worst, and may be neither proportional nor non-arbitrary.
I am not repeating the overstated conclusion that racism is one of the dangerous thoughts students should be challenged to confront — that universities simply continue the conversation, wherever it leads, as Richard Rorty used to argue about democracy. I am suggesting that our focus should be on education. For the individual “soul” — or reasonable mind, if you prefer — what is best? Harvard students have discussed this question. The Crimson Editorial Board posed this question about Michelle Jones in 2017, and correctly answered: Greater access to education is best. And this is generally the right answer.
Harvard's admission requirements include maintaining honesty, maturity, and moral character. Consider this University of Florida case, which illustrates an internal tension among these principles. A student who shares her concerns about her own racism checks the honesty box, precisely when exposing deficits in her moral character and maturity. The school rescinded her admission offer.
Now, let's consider a harder case. An enormous number of young people have been marching, talking, arguing, holding signs, and posting online in support of liberal and progressive causes: prison and criminal justice reform and unjust policing. And yet — one person's brave dissenter is another's brainwashed Marxist or immature privileged lout.
And hence the idea of a general digital amnesty, which gives up on the idea that uncurated social speech makes appropriate material for admissions committees. After high-school students engaged in protests against gun violence in 2018, schools tried out a limited amnesty policy and encouraged students to speak their truth without repercussions. This approach should extend to all social media, for those on the right and the wrong side of the debate over policing and protest, except in cases of criminal charges, pending or resolved.
Schools may respond that they have to act when things are brought to their attention. This is front-running, pure and simple. It suggests that social media influencers, whoever they may be — the rich, the popular, the disaffected — determine who will be handed over to admissions committees for discipline. This type of echo chamber may be better than a smoke-filled room, but it basically relies on social media to police itself. “Nemo iudex in causa sua”?
Letting students take some risks and make some mistakes seems like a very American approach to take. So, here are some blunt words in favor of letting students work out their mistakes. In fall 2020, admissions committees will be able to use an enormous range of online speech against prospective students. Consider long and hard what you want your school to do with it. If you favor barring social media malefactors, you are either saying that these potential students harm you, damage the school's brand, or that they are uneducable. Speech may hurt other students’ feelings, or in some cases even cause harm. I want to acknowledge this reality, while arguing that exclusion is typically not the answer. In the case of branding, the claim is obviously cynical and deserves derision. As for someone's putative un-educability, why are we so sure?
If the United States wants active citizen-students and not the automatons we see produced in authoritarian countries, it will allow high schoolers to generate speech and create large social networks relatively unsurveilled. Sometimes, some of them will say, F--- the police. Others will say, All Lives Matter. For the most part, the nuclear option of exclusion is not required, because places of higher education educate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School has adopted new restrictions that ban Law School affiliates from attributing statements made in class to their speaker, then publicly sharing this information with those not present for the original conversation. According to the Law School, its new Non-Attribution Policy responds to the danger of social media — a place where the school worries statements may be posted out of context, causing students to not participate fully in class discussions. Notably, the policy does not apply after Law students graduate and does not impact internal misconduct reporting.
We find the need to institutionalize such a rule regrettable. If the Law School is right about the world we live in, it is a shame that the fear of comments being taken in bad faith is so great that it requires formalized standards of basic decency. Respect for the truth should be reason enough to represent the view of others faithfully. That said, the expression of dissenting opinions should not provoke bullying or harassment, either.
To blanketly curtail a form of public discourse in order to remove the need for this respect seems like the wrong approach. It’s a strangely paternalistic move on behalf of the Law School: almost akin to revoking a child’s phone privileges. Instead, norms for what may leave the classroom should be worked out in individual interactions and reflected in class-specific policies.
Admittedly, whether the classroom should be treated as a public and private space is an open question. So, then, is whether classroom discussions should be public or kept private — after all, four wall policies are not a foreign concept on Harvard’s campus. For the Law School to institutionalize the privacy of classes is to too hastily decide that question, without regard for differences in classes’ formats, goals, and content. Additionally, the restricted time frame of the policy seems inconsistent with the supposed rationale of privacy protection, and the inconsistency reveals a lack of genuine engagement with the concepts of classroom privacy and responsibility.
We believe that an appropriate policy should acknowledge the importance of the classroom as a space for evolving thought without abandoning personal responsibility. While the classroom is certainly a place to grow in your beliefs and learn from others around you, it is not a land where speech has no consequences.
Harvard Law students are on the brink of holding enormous power in our society — they must know that they are responsible for their words, and their peers should be able to openly react to their conduct, as you’d expect students studying in democractic societies to be able to. The non-attribution policy must not serve an ulterior purpose of allowing students to eschew accountability for their speech. The same applies to professors, who do not, and should not, get a free pass under this new non-attribution rule.
The Law School claims that the rule will help “enable all in a broad and diverse community to learn from one another,” but it also risks stripping this diverse community of a means to address any offensive speech and hold each other to a high standard of mutual respect. We trust students to honestly and fairly contextualize their peers’ in-class comments — we can’t think of an example of Law students doing anything to the contrary, and the Law School cites none in its rollout of the policy.
The unprecedented rise of the online classroom during the pandemic has forced us to ask deep questions about digital privacy. The answers to these questions and our interpretation of privacy will have tremendous implications as we move forward in the digital age. Blunt institutional decisions cannot address these nuanced topics; we should encourage individual engagement, mutual respect, and reflection instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of undergraduates enrolled at Harvard this fall semester slightly topped the College’s enrollment projections in early August.
As of Wednesday, the last day students could announce a leave of absence without incurring any fees or tuition costs, 5,382 undergraduates were enrolled for the fall, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane. She also noted that the College is hosting 36 visiting students this semester.
Dean of the Faculty Arts of Sciences Claudine Gay originally projected that roughly 5,231 undergraduates would enroll this fall after surveying students about their plans. Though figures fluctuate slightly each year, Harvard had 6,755 enrolled undergraduates last year, per Common Data Set filings.
The Class of 2022 is now the College’s smallest cohort, with just 1,242 enrolled juniors, per the College’s current data. By comparison, the senior and sophomore classes number 1,347 and 1,378 members respectively. The newly-minted Class of 2024 — many of whom Harvard invited to live on campus — is the largest of the bunch, boasting 1,415 members. The freshmen class outnumber others despite its 340 members who deferred enrollment. Under typical circumstances, between 80 and 110 Harvard students take a gap year, according to the College’s website.
After Harvard announced it would only bring freshmen and select upperclassmen with extenuating circumstances back to campus and conduct its courses entirely online in the fall, many undergraduates expressed interest in taking a leave of absence. Students specifically said that the perceived lower quality of online learning, time zone difficulties, and the dearth of social interaction would deter them from enrolling.
The College administration has repeatedly assured students that it is committed to re-imagining virtual pedagogy and forging a remote community, including through an initiative dubbed “Harvard Everywhere.” Administrators also warned those considering a leave that — in keeping with past policy — they would lose their eligibility to participate in extracurriculars during their absence, as well as their priority for on-campus housing upon their return.
Despite this messaging, nearly 20 percent of undergraduates remained committed to taking a leave. Those who did choose to enroll are still free to take time off for much of the fall, but will now incur fees and tuition costs if they choose to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Catherine Dulac won a 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, one of the most prestigious and lucrative awards in the sciences, the prize’s foundation announced Thursday.
Dulac’s research focuses on the neurological bases of social behavior. The prize specifically recognizes her work examining the brain mechanisms behind parenting behaviors in males and females, which found that both sexes share common neural circuits that underlie both male and female-specific parenting behaviors.
Dulac told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that she was “shocked” to hear the news and credited her collaborators for their contributions to the research.
“All of this work was thought through and performed in very close collaboration with grad students, undergraduates, and postdocs,” Dulac said. “You never think alone.”
She told the Gazette that the prize was gratifying because some scientists in her field had looked down on her research when she first started it.
“Most neuroscientists typically work on the cortex while we looked at [the] hypothalamus, the area of the brain that organizes social behaviors,” she said. “They viewed it as less.”
The Breakthrough Prizes are awarded annually in the Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics, and Mathematics. Winners receive $3 million each, making it the most lucrative science prize in the world. Sponsors include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg, and Priscilla Chan ’07.The award comes less than a year after the Society for Neuroscience awarded Dulac its most prestigious honor, the Ralph W. Gerard Prize, a lifetime achievement award recognizing groundbreaking research in the field.
MCB professor Venkatesh N. Murthy, who directs Harvard’s Center for Brain Science, said in a department press release that he is elated to see Dulac’s “ground breaking” work win the Breakthrough Prize.
“She and her group have taken complex behaviors that are organized in hierarchies spanning minutes to days, and broken them down to manageable bits that can be studied with modern neurobiological tools,” Murthy said. “The results are revelatory.”
MCB chair Sean R. Eddy said in the release that he was also “overjoyed” to see Dulac’s contributions to neuroscience being awarded.
“It’s well deserved—and just the beginning, with so much interesting work coming out of her lab on how innate mammalian social behavior is wired, especially innate differences between male and female behavior,” he said.
In recent years, several Harvard affiliates have won Breakthrough Prizes.
The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, led by Astronomy lecturer Shep S. Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, won the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for producing the first-ever image of a black hole. Chemistry and Chemical Biology professor Xiaowei Zhuang was awarded a 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for her work in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.
The prize’s associated award ceremony — dubbed the “Oscars of Science” and typically attended by movie stars and tech entrepreneurs — has been delayed until March 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the country adapts to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and the response deadline for the decennial U.S. census closes in, the self-response rate for Massachusetts sits just under 70 percent.
In Middlesex County, where Cambridge is located, the self-response rate is slightly higher at 74.3 percent. In Suffolk County, which includes Boston and Allston, it sits just under 60 percent.
Daniel M. Riviello, co-chair of the Cambridge Complete Count Committee, said the challenges associated with the 2020 U.S. Census have not been limited to the pandemic.
“The 2020 census, in general, is complicated for a whole host of reasons,” Riviello said. “Right off the bat, it was complicated by the kind of back and forth over whether there would be a citizenship question added or not. I think that made a lot of people very uncomfortable with it — just general distrust in government.”
“And then COVID was just an even larger curveball that we weren’t expecting, which made it difficult to do any in person outreach for several months,” he added.
Riviello said the City of Cambridge has been able to adapt its outreach programs to the unprecedented conditions of the pandemic, even though it has not been able to pursue typical avenues.
“Through working with our partners and nonprofits and others on the ground, who are really still engaging with their audiences as much as possible, we’ve still been able to, I think, get the word out and try to get as many people to respond as possible,” Riviello said.
Riviello said, in the remaining weeks, the city’s focus has been on continuing to encourage people to fill out the census online and answer their doors for enumerators, in addition to working with federal census representatives to ultimately achieve a higher overall response rate.
Because of its large population of college students, Cambridge has also been working with local universities to ensure students are counted properly.
“People should be counted, or should count themselves, where they normally reside on April 1 2020,” Riviello said. “With COVID hitting right around that time, it made it difficult for students who would have been living off campus to fill out their census in Cambridge.”
Brigid O’Rourke, a spokesperson for the University, wrote in an emailed statement Harvard has worked with the U.S. Census Bureau and stakeholders in the Cambridge area “to support an accurate and successful census count.”
“Given the challenges COVID-19 presented to census efforts as many students returned home, Harvard most recently worked to fulfill the U.S. Census Bureau’s request to capture additional census data for students living off campus,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Sarah E. Gallop, a spokesperson for MIT, wrote in an emailed statement that MIT’s approach to outreach was “very straightforward.”
“MIT decided (as a result of conversations with Census officials) to provide so-called “Directory Information” for its students and other campus residents directly to the Census – it was as simple as that,” she wrote. “In March, we provided name, address, home address (US only), and birthdate which is all permitted under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).”
Sebastian Zapata, the senior analyst and Census liaison for the City of Boston, wrote in an emailed statement he is working with the director of Harvard’s First-Year Urban Program to make census outreach a part of the Global Day of Service.
"I’m working with Varsha Ghosh, Director, Student Engagement and Leadership & Director, First-Year Urban Program to engage with up to 100 Harvard students via the Class of 2024's Global Day of Service taking place on 9/12,” he wrote.
“During the Day of Service, we will conduct a massive phone bank to connect with Boston residents and have a conversation with them about the importance of participating in the U.S. 2020 Census. We hope to make a total of 5,000 calls,” Zapata added.
Correction: September 11, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sebastian Zapata is the deputy director of state relations for the City of Boston. In fact, he is the senior analyst and Census liaison.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
International students who planned to pursue their studies at their local universities this semester have had to grapple with grueling applications, uncertainty over the transferability of their class credits, and conflicting deadlines.
These challenges have pushed some Harvard students living outside of the United States to put their college education on pause as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Others, especially those in the United Kingdom, were able to continue their studies at universities abroad with little disruption.
On July 15, Harvard College announced that it would allow international undergraduates to pursue a study away option. College students living abroad would be able to enroll and transfer credits from accredited programs in their home countries. Several students said they were initially pleased about the possibility of choosing from a wider variety of classes and having greater flexibility in their schedules.
Those who pursued study away were asked to complete their local university’s application process and discuss courses they would like to apply towards their concentration with their department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies or head tutor.
William H.W. Wu ’22, who is now enrolled at National Taiwan University, described that process as nightmarish.
“I only got one course that I got from the lottery and approved by Harvard,” Wu said.
After communicating with Harvard’s Office of International Education, Wu reasoned that because he only had one transferable class credit, his course load at National Taiwan University did not merit enrolling at Harvard. He eventually decided to declare a leave of absence.
“I feel like just transferring that one-course credit and [having] to basically forgo a semester at Harvard, it's just unreasonable and also very wasteful because being at Harvard—it's the core of the experience,” Wu added.
Noah Miles ’23 also had plans to pursue study away by enrolling at Australian National University. Like Wu, though, he eventually decided to take a leave of absence, citing scheduling concerns.
Harvard’s announcement of the study away program came 14 days after Australian National University’s second semester began. Had Miles continued to push for his enrollment at ANU, he would have been asked to move from his home in Adelaide to ANU’s campus, enroll, and start classes in just three days.
“Ultimately, the timing didn’t work out,” Miles said.
For students living in the United Kingdom, however, the study away option was more viable. A total of 13 Harvard students were able to apply and enroll as visiting students at the University of Oxford within a month of the study away program’s inception.
Naomi Freud, Fellow and Director of Studies for Registered Visiting Students at St. Catherine’s College at the University of Oxford described those three weeks as a “positive frenzy of activity.”
Freud said she closely followed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ruling that would have barred students on F-1 visas from returning to the United States if they could not take an in-person course.
In light of ICE’s announcement, Freud reached out to Harvard’s Office of International Education on July 11 to see if there was any way she could help students. After Harvard and MIT sued the ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to counter their ruling, the agencies agreed to rescind the policy.
“We had a series of meetings on Saturday and Sunday [July 11 and 12], and then the first person to send in their application was on the 14th of July,” Freud said. “So from the 11th to the 14th we were setting it up and then the last student applied—he got in—it was on the fifth of August.”
Over the years, Harvard has sent in a number of visiting students to St. Catherine’s College, making it easier to facilitate communication between institutions.
“Students from Harvard have been coming to St. Catherine's for some time and I've met them personally,” Freud said. “So, we know each other very well.”
The Office of International Education’s established links meant that British students generally knew who to contact and could expect their plan of study to transfer between Harvard and Oxford.
Angela C. Eichhorst ’22 said she knew other British students from Harvard also enrolling at Oxford.
“I felt like other people had talked to OIE a lot more and then I kind of took a bit of a shortcut because other people put in more of the legwork first,” Eichhorst, a Crimson magazine editor, said. “People on this British group chat were like sending each other helpful emails that people could contact, so I would then talk to those people at the OIE or at Oxford.”
Humza K. Mahmood ’23, another British student enrolling at Worcester College at the University of Oxford, mentioned he was looking forward to getting involved in activities and on-campus life — an aspect of college that he would not be able to have during a remote semester at Harvard.
“I’m on a bit of an adventure, but closer to home,” Mahmood said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony S. Fauci discussed COVID-19 vaccine progress and the United States’ response to the pandemic in a talk at the Harvard Medical Grand Rounds on Thursday morning.
In his presentation, Fauci provided an overview of current scientific understandings of COVID-19, touching upon its epidemiology, virology, transmission, clinical manifestations, diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
Fauci, who is a lead member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, also reviewed the nation’s public health policies and current efforts. He said the data is “telling” when trying to understand the lack of success the United States has had when it comes to containing the COVID-19 outbreak.
Compared to the European Union — which substantially lowered its new COVID-19 case counts after the initial peak in late March — the United States has failed to lower its infection rate to the same extent, according to Fauci. He said this has resulted in a “disturbingly high” baseline number of cases over the past six months.
“[It’s] an extraordinarily unacceptable baseline when you’re thinking of so-called opening the economy and entering into the fall,” Fauci said.
Fauci also projected that, among the seven ongoing clinical trials supported by the U.S. government, at least one research group will have determined whether their vaccine is safe and effective by November or December of this year.
“I’m cautiously optimistic that we will [have a safe vaccine] based on really encouraging Phase 1 and animal data,” Fauci said. “Again, with vaccines you never say never and you never say always, there’s nothing guaranteed and we’ll just have to see, but these trials are progressing really well.”
Several CEOs of companies involved in the coronavirus vaccine development effort recently signed on to an agreement that ensures that safety and efficacy standards will not be compromised — an “unprecedented” move that Fauci said he strongly supported.
“They did it because there's a lot of talk about trying to rush the vaccine through before the election so that there could be a claim of victory,” Fauci said.
Hosted by three Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals — Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital — the Harvard Medical Grand Rounds are weekly academic conferences where guest speakers and lecturers discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unlike the typical format of in-person grand rounds, which are hosted by a specific department and only open to its own students, residents, and faculty members, this series is live-streamed and available for viewing across the world.
Eileen E. Reynolds '86, chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine at Beth Israel, said in an interview that she and the series's other organizers hoped to spread clinical expertise to a broader audience by opening it up to the public.
“We decided early on that our target audience was actually much bigger than our own individual departments,” Reynolds said. “There are a lot of places that are struggling with COVID that don't have access to their own grand rounds or the expertise that we were able to share on the range of topics.”
While Beth Israel, Brigham and Women’s, and Massachusetts General are typically competing hospitals, Reynolds said the series has given leaders at these institutions the opportunity to collaborate towards a shared goal during the pandemic.
“This gets at the very basic missions of doctors, which is that we want to work together to advance science and patient care,” Reynolds said.

Are COVID-themed classes just adding fuel to the fire, or do they actually have some redeemable qualities? Decide for yourself...
Love it — Maranda Ngue
COVID-19. Coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2. No matter how you say it, you probably feel resentful about the circumstances. However, just because you’re bitter towards the virus doesn’t mean you should avoid the classes about it. These days, it wouldn’t hurt to learn a thing or two about the coronavirus, to not only understand the science but also the social and economic impacts. Adding “COVID-19” to the course title is not merely clickbait; it’s relevant information that we’re lucky to have access to.
Sure, professors only learned these facts over the past few months, but they are also the ones who probably dedicated their entire summers to COVID research instead of TikTok, Disney Plus, and Netflix. Before you write their COVID-themed classes off as too last-minute, consider the fact that this knowledge is essential and state-of-the-art. This is the type of cutting-edge information you came to Harvard for!
Perhaps you’re worried about the high concentration of pre-meds in a coronavirus class, aiming to strengthen their med school applications and ultimately sucking the air out of the room. While you may assume that the people in SCRB 210: “COVID-19: Science, Medicine, and Therapeutics” will make you more stressed than the virus itself, be nice— who knows, one of these Harvard kids could make the new vaccine faster than you can say “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.” Virtual networking at its finest! Still dreading these intense pre-meds? No one will know if you flick their face on your laptop screen.
Though we hope you test negative for COVID-19, here’s to looking at the positive sides of coronavirus-themed classes. Clickbait? More like checkmate.
Hate it — Anna M. Peters
Every new school year comes with the debut of new course offerings. However, this year, due to the coronavirus, we not only have remote learning, but we now also have the introduction of new coronavirus-themed classes. Having mixed feelings? Take a read for all the reasons why you should not be a fan of coronavirus-themed classes.
No Q-guide Score Report
I’m sure that one of the first things we all do when browsing classes is to look at the Q-guide score report. The one thing that’s arguably just as, or even more, important than the class descriptions itself are the ratings. How would we know what we’re getting ourselves into if we don’t know the average number of hours of work per week, or the reviews from students who have taken the class in the past? With these new coronavirus-themed classes, you’d be jumping in blind. Enter at your own risk.
Hits Way Too Close to Home 
What’s worse than taking a class with no Q-guide score report? Taking a class that relates to your life a little ~too~ much. We’re all sure that 2020 is going to make it into the history books of the future, but that just means that it is something to be studied at a later time.
Just When You Thought You Couldn’t Lose Any More Hope...
Living through a global pandemic with seemingly no end in sight is hard enough. Taking a coronavirus-themed class with the hard realities presented in front of us by a world-renowned Harvard professor does not seem like the remedy. Just when you thought you couldn’t lose the very little hope that you do have left for life to improve, these classes will not hesitate to crush it.
If you still have your heart set on taking the GENED 1170: “Confronting COVID-19: Science, History, and Policy,” we will not stop you. But don’t say that we didn’t warn you.
