After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How long is a person actually supposed to live, and why?” writes a teenager ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to undergo chemotherapy. “Who determines that?”
The teen, known in court as Cassandra C., was diagnosed last year with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a disease with around an 80% post-chemotherapy survival rate. Despite these favorable odds, Cassandra and her mother have been fighting a legal battle with the state to gain the right to refuse treatment. The most recent ruling by the Connecticut Supreme Court has determined that Cassandra does not have this right and must undergo chemotherapy.
In life or death situations, it seems instinctive to fight for survival. When I first heard of Cassandra’s case, I couldn’t help but wonder why anyone with an 8 out of 10 shot would not go for it, and why anyone would refuse chemotherapy. I hoped she would change her mind.
But instinct, I’ve come to realize, isn’t infallible. In fact, as much as I wish Cassandra would lean towards treatment, I do not stand fully with the state’s decision.
For the most part, legal adults (those above age 18) or those practicing certain religious beliefs may refuse certain medical procedures altogether. Cassandra’s case is complicated by the fact that she is a minor who is not citing a religious belief as her reason for refusal of chemotherapy. In certain states, the mature minor doctrine allows minor teenagers who demonstrate maturity to make such decisions. Although Connecticut doesn’t employ such a doctrine, Cassandra’s lawyer argued it should–but to no avail. The court decided that “even assuming that the mature minor doctrine applies in this state, the respondents have failed to meet their burden of proving under any standard that Cassandra was a mature minor and capable of acting independently concerning her life threatening medical condition.” This conclusion was based on the fact that following an initial trial court decision, she ran away from home and missed court-mandated chemotherapy appointments. Furthermore, the court was concerned that certain external prejudices, like those of her mother, may have heavily influenced her.
But the decision the court has come to, I feel, has its faults.
For one, there is no magic age that determines maturity. I’m sure I’m not the first to say that 18 doesn’t feel much different than 17, and though I recognize that our legal system functions on fine lines and categories, not all societal issues clearly fit within said fine lines and categories.
But more importantly, as a blog post in the Economist highlights, Cassandra was judged to be an immature minor because she ran away from home in an attempt to avoid court-ordered chemotherapy treatments. In other words, because she actively decided not to follow the first court’s decision, the appeals court refused to give her a voice as a mature minor. This is unfair; the state should not have the right to base the legitimacy of its authority over her on the fact that she challenged the court’s legitimacy in the first place.
If Cassandra’s case were a bit different—if she were a Jehovah’s Witness in critical condition refusing life-saving blood transfusions—the courts would more likely be in her favor. In fact, in 2007, the Seattle Times reported that a judge had affirmed a 14-year old boy’s right to refuse such treatment for leukemia, stating that the boy knew that such a decision was akin to a death sentence. Fast forward a few years, change the disease, and we have a similar scenario but different results: for Cassandra, the state is not on her side.
It is agonizingly difficult to readily accept a young death that is preventable. But focusing only on the post-treatment survival statistics does not do justice to recognizing the immense physical and emotional tolls individuals like Cassandra go through, and this is not a peripheral point. The state does not have the right to force her to endure physical and emotional pain, regardless of how pure the intentions. The end doesn’t always justify the means.
Instincts can fail. The Supreme Court can be wrong. And here, the raw truth is that both have fallen short in doing justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is in the middle of “Selma” that I start to think about Harvard.
Later, I will tell my friend that I am glad that the movie did not shy away from the truth of our nation’s violence, that the fact that my great-great-grandparents were kicked and beaten and gassed is a truth that needs to be spoken. She will agree, tired of suffering being minimized.
They were assaulted.
They were bludgeoned.
They were spat on.
And in the middle of “Selma,” just before I start to think about my school, I think about how powerful hate is. How brazen and wrong they were, those people who used to live in my city, who used to infest my South.
They assaulted.
They bludgeoned.
They spat.
But I know, of course, that there is nothing past tense about it at all. I know that “Selma” is nothing old and Ferguson is nothing new. I know that, and I’ve known that, and yet, there is still something antiquated about that hate.
There is a way to dress and light an actor that makes it clear that they’re playing a bigot.
If lit and clothed correctly, you can tell that said character sleeps under a Confederate flag, and that they have once in the past seven years referred to President Obama as “our monkey leader,” and that the things they say will make you very, very unhappy.
From my personal film experience, that is how Hollywood does racism. If it is not a Black Film—e.g. “Selma”, “12 Years a Slave”— where the movie is explicitly about race as it was in history, and the racists are clear-cut and evil and ignorant and behind, then it is something else, something Urban or White Saviory—e.g. “The Blind Side”—or maybe it’s something else entirely, a metaphor, it’s “Avatar” or something.
Seldom is there a film explicitly about racial consciousness— e.g. “Crash.” I don’t have any white friends who have seen “Dear White People.” Back home, I don’t have any white friends who have even heard of “Dear White People.” In these movies, racists are only slightly veiled and the audience is challenged to examine underlying racist ideologies in both the characters and themselves. But I don’t think that’s entirely right, either.
In search of a more accurate portrayal of modern-day racists, something keeps leading me back to “Song of the South,” where unmistakable racism is presented as normal and is received as such by the audience. Racism operating at a level that is acceptable to the times, commonplace enough to be unspoken and uncontested. The kind of racism that furrows its brow at you, winces in the cheeks, raises its hands slightly: “Who, me?” Racism in a movie that is not about racism and not about race and not a Black movie. Racism that is—unarguably, unapologetically—just there.
Perhaps the primal scream conflict is tired, but did it get enough discussion initially? The day of primal scream, I overheard several White students behind me discussing, “Someone said that if it were all Black students streaking, the cops would get called.” “That’s dumb.” “That doesn’t make any sense. That’s not what it’s about.” That night, one group of students protested while another group streaked. We all know the story. Some students chose to make their voices heard.
They assaulted. (There were, in fact, reports of physical assault.)
They bludgeoned the silence with chants of “USA! USA! USA!”
They spat obscenities.
We've heard qualification. Perhaps the protest was poorly planned. Perhaps there was misunderstanding. But there is no misunderstanding that some students at this university took in the peaceful message of “Black Lives Matter” and responded less sad Sandra Bullock at the end of “Crash” and more boldface Joel Chandler Harris.
Hate is a powerful thing.
But it is also really, really sneaky.
There needs to be more conversation, but that’s been said. There needs to be more self-analysis, but that’s been said. There needs to be more dialogue and empathy, but that's been said. All of that has been said.
But selfishly, so selfishly, I cannot help but think about me.
In that movie theater I thought, “Even at Harvard.” But then I self-corrected, “Especially at Harvard.” Most days I think “Although at Harvard,” and though it is not the first thing on my mind, it is certainly there, and though I often personally think about and talk about race in classes or with friends, something about race at Harvard still seems so foggy.
And while I am struggling through this fog every day, it seems unfair, confusing, and concerning, that there are students who do not even think about it. And in that fog, if I let it get as dense and unclear and big as it truly could and perhaps should be, any kind of happiness becomes difficult, indistinct.
There is no resolution here. But at least, unlike back home in Georgia, where I have only ever had unforced conversations on race with my dad and the Black friend with whom I saw “Selma”, I can appreciate that I even recognize the fog here at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, Harvard students took a break from studying at Widener Library to spend the afternoon sliding down its steps in pilfered dining hall trays. While undergraduates enjoyed football in the snow in the Yard, snowball fights at the Quad, and a day off from classes on this historic occasion—after all, Harvard closing for snow is a very rare occurrence—several Harvard employees worked around-the-clock to ensure that critical services would remain open.
Winter Storm Juno was a potent reminder of the importance of these employees. It is not often that Harvard’s support staff appear in the news, but their critical contributions underlie all of the University’s activities, particularly in tough times.
The University staff members deserve our thanks, praise, and admiration for their hard work and dedication. Even as the Commonwealth fell under a state of emergency with shuttered airports and roadways, the University staff ensured its grounds remained passable; throughout the night, dozens of Campus Services snowplows kept walkways and driveways clear while individual employees with snow shovels cleared steps and building entrances. UHS Urgent Care stayed open, and dining halls continued to serve students. Some of the dining staff even stayed on campus overnight to ensure that there would be food during the worst of the storm.
We would like to take this opportunity to recognize a critical part of Harvard that deserves our thanks more often. These employees braved the blizzard to provide for our well-being. This defiance in the face of the snow and wind served also to maintain the University’s proud tradition of Postal Service-like refusal to be conquered by Mother Nature.
Moreover, just as we applaud the work of University support staff to ensure that students were kept safe during the storm, we also appreciate administrators’ efforts to minimize the academic impact of the cancellation. Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde wrote in an email to College students Tuesday night that students may make penalty-free changes to their study cards until next Wednesday. Students therefore can benefit from a full week of course shopping, while still allowing administrators the flexibility needed to manage section sizes and room assignments.
Harvard’s response Winter Storm Juno–academic, administrative, and physical—is worthy of commendation. From the deans to the snow plow drivers, University employees worked tirelessly to help maintain continuity during shopping week and in House life—two of the integral and unique traditions that define the Harvard experience. A more jarring interruption at the start of the semester would serve only to confuse, stress, and frustrate students, and complicate the jobs of deans and other critical administrators. The effective and flexible response has minimized the disruption to that moment students inevitably trudge back up the steps to Widener Library to return to their studies.
To all the Harvard employees: Thank you.

About a foot of powdery snow fell over Cambridge Monday night and into Tuesday morning, blanketing Harvard’s campus in what the National Weather Service called a “crippling and potentially historic” snowstorm. Eight or more inches were expected to accumulate throughout the day, according to an emergency email communication sent to Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates at about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday.
Administrators suspended University operations Tuesday for all non-critical personnel and will communicate scheduling for Wednesday late on Tuesday, according to the emergency email. FAS canceled all Tuesday courses and sections. According to a Tumblr page created by the FAS Registrar’s Office, some listed FAS courses will be canceled Wednesday.
As of 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, Harvard shuttle service had been suspended, but limited service may be available later, according to the shuttle service’s website.

UPDATED: January 28, 2015, at 12:06 a.m.
Harvard will resume full operations Wednesday after it closed for a “potentially historic” blizzard that dumped about two feet of powdery snow on the Boston area Monday night and Tuesday and spurred Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 to declare a state of emergency.
Classes across the University will proceed as normal Wednesday, although the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office has listed select class cancellations and reschedulings on its Tumblr blog.
According to an emergency email communication sent to FAS affiliates at about 7 p.m Tuesday, “all buildings will be open and walkways will be passable, if not completely clear” on Wednesday. A parking ban implemented by the City of Cambridge has not yet lifted, but parking officials will make accommodations for drivers if necessary, according to another Tuesday email sent to University affiliates from Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp.
While Harvard transit services closed on Tuesday because of the storm—which has been nicknamed “Juno”—shuttle services will resume Wednesday morning at 5:15 a.m. with the first Quad Stadium Express departure, according to Carl Tempesta, associate director of transit, fleet, and charter services.
The blizzard, which the National Weather Service called “crippling” and prompted the closure of the MBTA on Tuesday, hit much of the Northeast. At Harvard, the storm interrupted course shopping week for undergraduates, offering students a rare snow day but less time to try out spring classes.
Despite the disruption, students still must submit their course study cards by the regular Friday deadline, but students who miss that deadline will not be required to acquire extra signatures or pay extra fees through Feb. 4, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde told College students in an email Tuesday.
In the past, Harvard has rarely closed for weather events; the University shut down recently for 2012’s Hurricane Sandy and 2013’s winter storm “Nemo.” In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world,” although the University closed for the blizzard of 1978.
Although University operations will resume as normal Wednesday, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a press conference on Tuesday that he expected snow in Boston to continue accumulating until about 4 a.m. Wednesday. The Massachusetts state travel ban enacted during the storm, meanwhile, lifted at midnight Wednesday; MBTA service will also resume operations Wednesday.
While the University remained closed all of Tuesday and shuttle services were suspended, many students used their day off of classes to enjoy the snow. At least two snowball fights, one held in the MAC Quad and the other in the Radcliffe Quad, attracted dozens of bundled students. Some sledded down Widener Library’s steps on dining hall trays in the powdery snow.

In the earliest start since its inception, the On-Campus Interview program began during the week of Wintersession this winter, rather than overlapping with shopping week—a shift welcomed by students.
A combination of faculty pressure and student demand brought about the shift in the timing of OCI’s first week, which is traditionally marked by a high concentration of interviews with financial firms.
“Part of the impetus for looking at this is we actually had a number of faculty over the years complain about missing classes for interviews,” said Robin E. Mount, the director of Harvard’s Office of Career Services. “Also a lot of students saying they don’t want to have to choose [between classes and interviews].”
A shift forward was originally piloted during last year’s round of interviews when interviews began on the Thursday before classes started.
“That was sort of our way of testing the waters, seeing if students would really want interviews during this time, and the feedback at that point in time was that it was much easier to be focused on interviews rather than having competing activities [such as classes],” said Deborah A. Carroll, the OCS staff member in charge of OCI.
Michelle Geng ’15, a senior graduating in December, was grateful for the shift.
“It makes a huge difference not having to go class and do shopping [while interviewing],” Geng said. “So I’m very glad they did that finally. Yes, your vacation gets cut short a week, but the tradeoff of not having to go through stress is really amazing.”
Geng, who went through OCI in 2014 and was employed by BlackRock in the summer of that year, believes that students have appreciated the change.
“In general, I think people love the fact that it’s starting before school starts because when I did OCI last year, it was very stressful,” Geng said. “I just didn’t go to class.”
Some students, however, have found the new timeline has created conflicts. Nancy Liu ’16 found that Wintersession programming to which she had committed earlier in the year conflicted with OCI. Liu was unable to attend much of the conference put on by the Harvard College in Asia Program due to interviews.
According to Carroll and Mount, athletes in winter sports also ran into conflicts with interviews during Wintersession.
“There were some students who were training with the sports team or were travelling internationally, and it was difficult to get back, but again, it’s only a subgroup of juniors that were impacted,” Mount said. “Some had to arrange a Skype interview or rearrange and go a little bit off cycle. Employers were sometimes willing to make alternative arrangements for those students.”
According to Carroll, these kinds of conflicts between athletic commitments and interviews are not new.
“Frankly, that’s a problem for student athletes any time of the year,” Carroll said. “Even if we had interviews two weeks from now, we would still face that same challenge with certain populations like the athletes.”

Harvard Business School Professor Clayton S. Rose will assume the presidency of Bowdoin College in July, according to a college-wide email released Monday by Chair of the Bowdoin College Board of Trustees Deborah Jensen Barker. The Bowdoin board of trustees unanimously approved a search committee’s unanimous decision to select Rose for the role Monday morning.
“He’s going to be terrific as Bowdoin’s next president,” Barker wrote in her email. “He is immensely qualified academically, combining a passion for the liberal arts and a dedication to teaching and learning with extensive leadership experience.”
A faculty member at the Business School since 2007, Rose pioneered a second-year elective class in 2009 titled “Managing the Financial Firm” in response to the 2008 financial crisis, using the collapse of Lehman Brothers as a case study.
“The course was shaped very fundamentally by the financial crisis,” Rose said in a 2009 interview.
Rose brought to the class his experience as a former vice chairman at JP Morgan’s predecessor company JP Morgan & Co. There, he headed two of the firm’s five major departments and led its global diversity initiative, according to a profile of him on Forbes. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania, according to his Business School faculty page.
Apart from his professorship, Rose is currently a director at both Bank of America and XL Group PLC, as well as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
“Bowdoin is an exceptional liberal arts college, with a rich history, distinct set of values, and a gifted, engaged and devoted group of faculty, students, staff and alumni,” Rose said in a press release. “I am honored and excited by the opportunity to lead this special institution, and Julianne and I are very much looking forward to becoming part of the Bowdoin and Brunswick communities.”
Bowdoin search committee members and former colleagues from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute echoed support for Rose in light of his academic and administrative credentials.
“Clayton Rose is quite thoughtful with a great sense of integrity and a passion for social justice...He beautifully articulates the value of a liberal arts education, yet he understands the pressures facing the College now and in the future,” search committee member and Bowdoin professor Jack Bateman said in Barker’s email.
“As someone who has moved from the corporate world to academia and is convinced that liberal education is the one thing needed in our increasingly utilitarian universe, Clayton will be a powerful spokesperson for the value of the liberal arts,” Bowdoin professor and search committee member Paul Franco said in the email.

Currier House Master Richard W. Wrangham will take a sabbatical this spring while remaining in residence in the House. Wrangham’s co-master, Elizabeth A. Ross, will perform most formal House master duties, such as attending administrative meetings, while he is on sabbatical, Wrangham said.
According to a Monday email from Currier House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper to Currier affiliates, Wrangham will “be taking a step back” this spring, and students wishing to personally contact him should first reach out to Pepper.
Wrangham, a professor in the department of Human Evolutionary Biology known for his work on primates and evolution, said he will spend the sabbatical writing a book that examines similarities between humans and domesticated animals and explores human aggression.
While some faculty members spend their sabbaticals away from their home and colleagues, Wrangham said he and Ross made the conscious decision to remain in residence at Currier this spring.
“It’s difficult, because if you want a sabbatical in your home place, you tend to carry on doing many of the responsibilities that you have in your ordinary life,” he said. “But [Elizabeth and I] like being in Currier; we wanted to stay here… We plan to juggle.”
Currier House Committee Co-Chair Hannah G. Sears ’16 said she does not think that Wrangham’s term on sabbatical will have any noticeable impact on student life in the House.
“I don’t know how it will affect things on an administrative level, but from a student life perspective, I think he will still be present,” Sears said, noting she had recently met with Wrangham several times and that she expects that he will remain involved in Currier’s social life.
Wrangham’s sabbatical coincides with other administrative transition in Currier as Robert C. Meisner, who was recently named the House’s acting dean, assumes his new post. While Wrangham acknowledged that the spring would be a time of transition for Currier, he said he does not anticipate any issues.
“I am totally confident that everything will go well,” he said.

UPDATED: January 28, 2015, at 2:59 p.m.
Naisha Bradley, who for nine years served as program manager of the Kennedy School of Government’s Women and Public Policy Program, has been named the new director of the Harvard College Women’s Center.
Bradley officially assumed her post on January 26.
According to an announcement email sent to College affiliates on Monday from Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College's assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion, Bradley will be responsible for developing and implementing the “strategic direction of the Center,” providing “operational oversight,” and running programs and events that address subjects related to women, gender, and sexuality.
Bradley said that the Women’s Center is a “natural fit” for her, citing her expertise in program development and design and implementation of policy.
“I have always thought of [the Women’s Center] as an incredible resource for students,” said Bradley, adding that her life goal has been “creating a powerful community of women.”
While Bradley has not officially named any new initiatives or programs, she hopes to begin her new position by reaching out to a diverse group of students for ideas about the direction of the Women’s Center.
“First we want to talk with students already involved [at the Women’s Center], but we need to also reach out to students in different Houses,” Bradley said of her outreach goals, adding that she is excited to be “working closely with students.”
The Harvard College Women’s Center opened in 2006 and currently sponsors dozens of events related to gender, sexuality, and diversity each semester, according to its website.
The center also serves as a meeting space for student organizations and events during the year and is located in the basement of Canaday Hall, one of freshman dormitories in Harvard Yard. There are currently almost 30 undergraduate, women-centered student organizations supported by the Women’s Center, in addition to mentor programs.
Outside of her work at Harvard, Bradley has served at the Yawkey Boys and Girls Club of Roxbury. She received her bachelor’s degree at Clark Atlanta University and master’s degree in Gender and Cultural Studies at Simmons College.

UPDATED: January 28, 2015, at 3:49 p.m.
As “potentially historic” levels of snow fell on Cambridge and Harvard canceled all but its non-essential operations on Tuesday amid a state of emergency, Houses offered up space to accommodate dining hall workers and students spent a rare snow day sledding down library steps.
According to Crista Martin, a Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson, all HUDS dining staff are considered essential University employees and were asked to work as scheduled on Tuesday if they could safely arrive at Harvard.
Many Houses hosted their HUDS workers overnight, whether in House masters’ residences or on couches. Richard W. Wrangham, co-master of Currier House, estimated that 17 workers, most of whom lived too far from Harvard for travel, stayed overnight in Currier.
Although having the staff sleepover was part of an emergency contingency plan, Currier dining hall worker Patricia C. Machado called it a “nice” experience, adding that students showed their appreciation through thank-you cards and applause.
“Being in Harvard buildings, I felt a lot safer,” Machado said. “We have food; we have power.”
Some dining hall staffs enlisted the help of House affiliates Tuesday, such as student swipers, to keep operations smooth. In Pforzheimer House, more than 20 students signed up on a Doodle poll to work in the kitchens throughout the day, according to House Co-Master Anne Harrington ’82.
“Our staff has been spectacular,” Eliot House Co-Master Douglas A. Melton said. “They were a little short-handed so [Eliot House Co-Master] Gail [O’Keefe] and I and some of the students did some of the swiping; students helped shovel walks.”
As snow piled up across campus on Tuesday, undergraduates trekked through the snow on mostly empty streets, passersby traveling on cross-country skis replacing the usual motor vehicle traffic. Students put their House pride at stake in several snowball fights, both in the Quad and on the River. Others careened down Widener Library’s steps on makeshift sleds—mostly dining hall trays—and some crossed the Charles River to sled at Harvard Stadium.
Some House Committees, too, organized programming for students on their unexpected free day, from offering L.A. Burdick hot chocolate to slashing prices on House merchandise.
Christine Y. Hwang ’17 said she enjoyed the day’s opportunity to see her peers, though it interrupted her schedule. While she attended some House events, Hwang spent most of her snow day watching shows on Netflix in her dorm room.
Esther Jeon ’18 went out in the blizzard at midnight Tuesday with friends to sled down the steps of Widener, then in the morning joined her entryway and others to do it again.
“Even if it was inconvenient for my shopping schedule, it was worth it,” she said, shortly before leaving to assist Annenberg Hall staff for the dinner shift.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team (1-3) finished out the weekend at home with a split after losing to No. 11 IPFW (5-2) in straight sets Saturday at the MAC.
“We felt good going into this match as well,” senior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick said. “We knew that IPFW was probably going to be better than Ball State, but we also were confident after the win on Friday. We were excited for the match and ready to go.”
Though the final match score suggested an lopsided day, all three sets went to more than 25 points. Senior outside hitter DJ White spearheaded the Crimson offense with a near double-double, finishing with 16 kills and nine digs. Younger brother and fellow outside hitter Casey White also nearly had a double-double, with 10 kills and eight digs.
We had just gotten back from playing the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the nation,” freshman setter Marko Kostich added. “The week was focused on correcting the mistakes that were apparent against those two teams.”
Kostich had 42 assists during the match, and Zimmick recorded eight kills. The latter was also named EIVA Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts, while White was named Offensive Player of the Week in a Crimson sweep.
The team had a higher hitting average than the Mastodons—and the previous game—with .340 as well fewer errors, but could not match its opponent in the number of attacking plays, which had 29 more attacks.
On the defensive side, Zimmick had five blocks, almost half of the team total of 11. The Crimson held IPFW to a .256 kill percentage, but despite the team’s efforts, the Mastodons had 56 kills and six aces.
“IPFW served more aggressively than Ball State, and they saw greater success with their right-side attack,” Kostich said. “Knowing a hitter's tendencies in different situations of the game is something that takes a while to learn. I think this weekend was a step in the right direction.”
In the opening set, Harvard fell behind by six points early on, but bounced back to tie the set up at 16 points. The team did get a 25-24 advantage, but IPFW had two kills in a row to put it on top and shift momentum. Casey White responded with a kill for Harvard, tying up the game, but it was not enough to stop the Mastadons, which won 28-26.
“Considering we lost by two each game, and in extra points each time, we aren't extremely upset with our play. We fought hard and just couldn't finish,” Zimmick said.
The second set was nearly identical to the first, except it found Harvard with the early lead by four points, but the team was set back by errors that allowed IPFW to get back into the game.
Similar to the previous set, Harvard came away with a 25-24 lead, but IPFW pushed the game to 26-25 with a pair of kills. Harvard tied the game up, but IPFW came away with the 28-26 win.
“I think it's encouraging to see our fight and high level of play,” Zimmick said. “We now know that we have to work on completing the match and playing our best at the end of each set.”
The Crimson had the lead for most of the third set, with an offense led by DJ White who had six kills in the set. Though Mastodons took the 24-23 lead late in the set, Harvard fought through several match points before ultimately falling 31-29.
“It's still early in the season, so we are getting to know each other more each week on the court.” Kostich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s fair to say that few people predicted the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s hockey team to start the season off how it did: scorching hot. Wins over traditional powers Boston College and Boston University highlighted a 9-1-2 start in the team’s first 12 games, five of which came against opponents that are currently ranked by U.S. College Hockey News.
Yet, some skeptics still hesitate to place the Crimson among the elite teams in the conference just yet.
Because of the program’s meteoric rise over such a small period, doubters have been waiting all season for the other shoe to drop. Common sentiment remained that the performance of the team was unsustainable—that its days atop the standings of the ECAC were numbered.
This reality is reflected in polling discrepancies that have existed throughout the campaign. In the Dec. 1 USCHO poll, Harvard received the second-most first place votes, yet it came in at ninth overall.
The showdown at Madison Square Garden against archrival Yale seemed to support these skeptics (at least those guilty of confirmation bias). With a chance to send an emphatic message to the rest of the league, the team balked. The Crimson was lucky to limp away with a 4-1 loss, having been outshot two-to-one that night.
To add injury to insult, junior defenseman Patrick McNally—the leader in points per game amongst defenseman in the ECAC—left the game in the second period and did not return. The rumblings that Harvard couldn’t play on the big stage with the big boys got louder.
A week later, a solid win against then-ECAC fourth place Clarkson was overshadowed by a four-goal loss against St. Lawrence at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The Crimson tried to respond in front of the most hostile fish-throwing fans in the country at Lynah Rink in Ithaca. With the game seemingly headed to overtime, Cornell center Eric Freschi beat junior goaltender Steve Michalek nearside in the final seconds to hand Harvard a type of loss that could deflate the momentum it had held all year long. The Crimson had lost three of its last four.
But don’t wait for Harvard’s collapse with baited breath. It’s not coming anytime soon.
Even given all that has gone wrong for the Crimson as of late, the team still sits at No. 4/4 in the country. The team still has four of the top seven point-getters in conference play. The team still boasts its star netminder, Michalek, whose .932 save percentage ranks fourth in the conference.
Harvard has weathered losses to its front lines swimmingly. After averaging 1.67 points per game in his first nine contests, Kerfoot went down in late November in a win at UMass-Lowell. A few games later, sophomore forward Sean Malone sustained another injury against Rensselaer after returning to action only a few weeks prior.
But sophomore center Tyler Moy has stepped in without missing a beat. After notching only 10 points in 27 games his rookie season, the second-year star has already contributed 17 points in nine fewer games.
Even some of the losses during this stretch—which were easy to get caught up in nominally—were not as bad as they appeared at the surface. Despite the four-goal loss to St. Lawrence, the Crimson attack rained fire on the Saints’ goaltender, getting off 47 shots to St. Lawrence’s 22. That’s a loss that can be chalked up at least partially to tough luck.
And, after a devastating loss at Cornell and with doubts about the team’s future success running rampant, Harvard strolled into Starr Rink and dominated No. 15/13 Colgate. Despite finding the net for the first time midway through the second frame, the Crimson piled on six goals while Michalek and the defense turned away 30 shots.
Having been in danger of dropping four-of-five in super competitive ECAC, Harvard made a statement: losing was no longer acceptable.
For those who were thinking the Crimson would fade quietly into the dark New England winter, think again. Harvard is here to stay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
7.44 seconds.
That’s the amount of time it took for senior Danielle Barbian to cross the line and win the 60-meter title at the Lobo Collegiate Invitational this past weekend.
It’s also the time that appears in the Harvard and Ivy League record books. The Sussex, Wis, native’s performance in New Mexico matched her record-setting mark which won her the Ancient Eight title the past season.
In addition to her record-matching performance in the 60-meter dash, Barbian ran for a personal best 24.46 seconds in the 200-meter race, .28 seconds faster than her previous best. The senior’s performance in the 200 ranks fourth all-time in Harvard history.
The senior was able to post this time competing against unfamiliar opponents such as Arizona, Houston, and New Mexico.
Head coach Jason Saretsky believes that Barbian’s ability to perform at her best even when not facing traditional rivals of the Northeast highlights the senior’s talent.
“I think it’s a great sign of what’s still to come,” Saretsky said. “To go out of her comfort zone, facing competition she had never seen before, particularly in the sprints where one of the biggest things is staying relaxed and staying confident. For her to be able to do that in that situation speaks to the championship runner that she is.”
In track and field, it’s difficult for runners to come close, let alone match or break records in sprint events. With races such as the 60-meter dash being decided by miniscule differences, it’s hard to consistently bring times down.
But Barbian has done just that. The senior’s times in the 60-meter dash have gone down with each race. After starting the year with a 7.54 runner-up finish at the BU season opener, she clocked in at 7.53 seconds at the Beantown Challenge en route to her first title of the season before her mark in New Mexico.
Small technical improvements make all the difference, from achieving a good start to accelerating deep in the race with the use of a quick turnover.
This has helped Barbian not only in the 60-meter dash, but also in the 200-meter race, an event in which the senior has been setting personal records despite having run the event only a few times before this year.
The ability to be successful and compete in both short and long sprints emphasizes the versatility that the senior brings to the squad.
“She ran a better technical race last weekend, [especially] in the 200,” said women’s sprints coach Kebba Tolbert. “That really signals how her mental approach to the sport has changed over the last year. She’s much stronger mentally to where she can become a factor at the conference level in the 200…It’s a really good indicator of how far she’s come.”
According to Saretsky, the constant improvements by Barbian demonstrate the effort and hard work that the senior has put in this season. Continuing these efforts is key for Barbian to win more titles and be triumphant at meets such as the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships later on in the season.
“We try to set up our student-athletes to perform their best when it matters the most, which is at the end of the season.” Saretsky said. “Right now she’s just really putting in the work and training at a really high level to prepare her for the end of the season.”
With a critical portion of the indoor season coming up for the track and field team, it will be key for all runners to deliver good results, especially Barbian. Tolbert believes that the senior will be one of these key runners and that the senior has the potential to deliver a great performance and leave a lasting impression on a program of which she has become an integral component.
“She’s going to show up and give you her best,” Tolbert said. “The effort is there…. You can just see it in how she approaches the sport, the way she takes care of herself on and off the track. Just taking care of those little things sets an example for the rest of our group.”
