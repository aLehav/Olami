After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In our rushed daily lives, it often seems utopian to find time to reflect on past grievances. English indie-folk singer-songwriter Birdy beautifully opens up this space in her fourth studio album “Young Heart.” “Young Heart” was released on April 30, 2021, and took four years to finish — a careful process that is reflected in the album’s narrative arc from heartbreak to healing.
“Young Heart” marks a turning point in Birdy’s musical career. The instrumental interplay between the guitar and the piano brings out a warm, stripped-back sound and leaves behind the big, theatrical one we heard on previous albums, such as “Beautiful Lies.” Birdy’s conversational, vulnerable lyrics — which stem from the singer’s personal experience of a breakup — are undoubtedly the highlight of the album. It is astonishing how she nevertheless succeeds in making this her most poetic, relatable, and comforting album yet, reflecting her growth as a person and artist.
The album’s first song depicts a departure, which can be interpreted as being from a partner, a situation, or even a country; “Voyager” starts with birds chirping, a playful allusion to her stage name and an ode to spring, the season of departure. The last line of the chorus, “I’m a voyager, and I voyage on,” describe her very nature: free-spirited and unapologetic as she moves toward her next calling. Although the song’s guitar instrumentation makes for one of the more joyous and faster tempos than others on the album, the lyrics juxtapose these upbeat sonics with a hint of melancholy about the inevitable end of the relationship or situation: “I know our days are numbered, but you don't know that I feel like that / You don't hear solitude, calling me away.” From early on in the album, she introduces solitude as part of the healing experience — a thread that she weaves through multiple songs.
In “Nobody Knows Me Like You Do,” Birdy returns to familiar territory with a wistful piano ballad that contains some of the most piercing and personal lyrics on the album. The minor chords and slow, independent melodies she assigns to the piano interplay beautifully with Birdy’s voice, conjuring the image of her harmonizing with her beloved. She reflects on her conflicting feelings about the breakup through paradoxical lyrics. “I swore I'd be fine 'til I realized that you still love me” may refer to a glimmer of hope but also shows how the feeling is hindered by the fact that the other person has not moved on. Her falsetto is contrasted with the lower range of the piano chords to mirror the tension in the lyrics. Towards the end of the ballad, she confronts her guilt and regret over the breakup: “And I know that I decided we had different lives to lead / Not sure what it was I thought I'd found once I was free.”
With its hesitant guitar plucking and lyrics like “Little Blue finds me again / Creeps over my heart,” “Little Blue,” the most intriguing song on the album, explores an unnamed feeling. Throughout the song, Little Blue grows sonically to represent a variety of feelings and concepts that come to life through personification. This culmination is heightened through the reluctant instrumentation and vocals. The most obvious interpretation may take it as a reminiscence on joyful times with the partner who has left: “Little Blue, reminds me of the love I had that's gone / Little Blue, in you is where those memories live on.”
The way she speaks directly to an abstract, usually negatively connotated feeling as if it was an understanding friend is truly sinning. When she sings, “Don't leave too soon / Please, keep me close to you,” this might refer to the messy process of healing in which we want to delay a clean cut by indulging in memories. However, Birdy certainly doesn’t limit herself to this interpretation. Little Blue might as well describe a kind of solitude, melancholy, or coping mechanism that is comforting rather than overwhelming. Accordingly, the careful introduction of strings and background vocals later in the song serves to create a comforting ambiance. The open-endedness of Birdy’s poetic soul-searching really contributes to the narrative, as it allows her listeners to turn to the song for any range of feelings they may be trying to figure out and work through.
The six-minute gem that is the title song, “Young Heart,” concludes the album’s journey towards healing and refers back to the first song, “Voyager.” The song is written as an apology, explanation, and farewell to her former lover. Birdy touches on a sentiment all too familiar to listeners around her age: “I'm still a young heart / There's so much I don't know / And I'm changing.” In contrast to many of the more hesitant songs on the album, the vocals and instrumentation are delivered confidently, lending the album and the journey an air of finality. Though it starts as a classic Birdy piano ballad, she adds different musical elements to the song as it progresses, among them an airy falsetto section that showcases Birdy’s dreamy vocals, and a theatrical descending melody. The lyrics “And it's been on my mind some time / I found a way to never let it show / But it was too hard” take listeners back to the departure depicted in “Voyager,” where she similarly felt that the relationship would inevitably come to an end. This time, however, she clearly rejects this as an unhealthy way of handling the breakup: “And though I still need you now / Baby, I won't hold you down.” She repeats the line “I’ll keep on loving you” many times until the song ends, showing us that although she put the relationship behind, her love and memories will not fade.
“Young Heart” journeys from conflicting feelings about an inevitable departure toward finding solace in solitude and accepting the breakup. With introspective, vulnerable lyrics, Birdy successfully shows us what stays, and what doesn’t, when we move on.

If you think Wusong Road’s “Chinese Tiki” concept is unique, think again. Confusing? Sure. Problematic? Agreed. But Chinese Tiki is not new. A quick Google search of “Chinese Tiki” will bring up seven other similarly-themed restaurants in the state of Massachusetts alone. Some of these establishments are operating under the label of “Chinese Tiki” or something akin, like “Cantonese and Polynesian,” while others have more implicitly been deemed as “Chinese Tiki” by Google’s algorithmic calculus, based on keywords from reviews, menus, and websites. Wusong Road follows the former’s explicit mode of characterization: It’s website describes the new restaurant and bar as “American Chinese cuisine and tropical Tiki escapism.”
Chinese Tiki establishments can be found all over the US — especially in big coastal cities. Wusong Road is not alone in marrying Chinese and Tiki exotica, nor is it a revival of the practice. Wusong Road is the latest, more modern and stylized iteration of a tradition that runs through the fabric of culinary history.
On the website, Chef-owner Jason Doo, insists that the establishment “is not intended to be a ‘political’ or ‘social’ commentary on Tiki culture.” I would push back and ask, how can Chinese Tiki not be political? Sure, patrons enjoying a weekend dinner are likely not thinking about the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, U.S. military occupation, or the facetious history of white American attitudes towards Chinese food. Sure, Wusong Road may not be intentionally perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Hawaiian and Chinese women. However, it is vital to contextualize the history of oppression, colonialism, and cultural exchange that Wusong Road operates within.
By its very nature — ethos, design, food — Wusong Road is a result of the American empire’s living legacy, occupying a position in both culinary and broader American history. With Chinese Tiki comes a messy set of implications, fueled by entangled histories of Chinese ethnic and racial identification, assimilation, the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands, U.S. militarism, Cold War anti-communism, the promulgation of U.S. liberalism and capitalism, and more. This review will offer a sliver of Chinese American food history, and Wusong Road’s intervention on a longstanding political history.
Let’s break these dynamics down: As part of a digital archive project titled “150 Years of Chinese Cuisine in America,” a student group from UCLA cites that there are “over 45,000 Chinese restaurants across the United States, more than the number of McDonalds, Burger Kings, Kentucky Fried Chickens, and Wendy’s, combined.” It is safe to assume most of these restaurants are not Chinese Tiki, Cantonese Polynesian, or any other ambiguous permutation. The post-1965 immigration boom oversaw a significant diversification of Chinese food, as immigrants from different regions of China — for example, Sichuan, Hunan, Beijing, Hong Kong, etcetera— brought with them their localized culinary traditions.
Chinese Tiki occupies a unique place in Chinese food history. Dr. Tanfer Emin Tunç, a professor at the Hacettepe University Department of American Culture and Literature, places its peak popularity in the 1950s. In “Chop Suey and Sushi from Sea to the Shining Sea,” Tunç has written that during the 1950s, “most of these restaurants shared the same culinary palate — anything that featured pineapple or maraschino cherries suddenly became Polynesian or Hawaiian — and aesthetic, conflating a variety of Asian and South Pacific cuisines and cultures into menus decorated with hula girls and kitschy tiki artifacts.” She references two California-based Chinese Tiki restaurants, the China Trader and the Don the Beachcomber chains that “served a number of Hawaiian drinks and dishes,” while their menus “deployed sketches of relaxed and sexually accessible Hawaiian girls to sell cocktails, exploiting another culture in much the same way Chinese culture was being prostituted.” Restaurants like these did not just bastardize Hawaiian aesthetics to line their walls and decorate their bars, they also participated in a history of sexual violence that exploited and fetishized Hawaiian women. Sexualizing the sacred hula tradition filled seats in supposedly “authentic” Chinese and Polynesian eateries. These Chinese restaurants, owned by Chinese or non-Chinese people alike, catered to white customers by offering them escapes into a tropical-exotic-Orient hybrid.
Wusong Road Chef-owner Doo explains, “Growing up in my parent’s American Chinese restaurant… Scorpion bowls, pupu platters, zombies, Mai Tais, and Peking ravioli were all standard dishes… these dishes and drinks to me were Chinese, because if anything Chinese food is highly adaptable and will always change to serve local taste.” In a place like Cambridge, Doo offers Wusong Road as a tropical escape, while qualifying that the restaurant “purposefully lacks many of the totems and imagery from Maori mythology commonly found in Tiki bars.” Wusong Road is also absent of the sexually exploitative imagery of Hawaiian women. Does this mean Wusong Road loses all of its political implications and potential to be critiqued? I do not think so. The restaurant’s interior is still overwhelmingly decorated with conflations of Hawaiian culture and aesthetics. Imbued in these pieces of decor are reminders of empire, and the impact of U.S. capitalism and militarism in Hawai’i, and on Chinese Americans, too.
In analyzing the aforementioned Don the Beachcomber restaurant chain example, which was ironically started by a white man from the U.S. South, Tunç reveals that “[the restaurant] depicted imperialist maps and was decorated with nude hula girls.” She continues by arguing these depictions “attempted to counteract fears of Chinese immigrants as inassimilable yellow perils by comforting American society with entertaining buffoonery and gratuitous sex.” Don the Beachcomber had lasting impacts on white American perceptions of Chinese immigration and how Chinese Americans saw themselves. Tunç gives an apt analysis, as many Chinese restaurants serve as a space in which Chinese Americans are confronted with their own racialization, forced to hash out their racial identity to fit American capitalist and multicultural society calls for assimilation. For white consumers, Chinese restaurants have historically served as playgrounds to venture into the so-called unknown, the “Orient.”
Chinese food has a long and fraught history in America, and has undergone countless different iterations, evolutions, and reimaginings. This culinary exchange dates back to the 1700s when Western merchants first landed in Chinese ports. Like Doo, I agree that Chinese cuisine was — and is — a path for some Chinese people to find economic survival, and for others, success. Chinese food’s adaptability enabled it to become the sensation it is today, however, I would again push back on Doo’s willingness to assert that Chinese food’s adaptability necessitates the birth of Chinese Tiki.
Chinese Tiki subsumes Hawaiian culture and appropriates its aesthetics under the ambiguous guise of Chineseness — that which defines or is associated with Chinese ethnic identity — making nonsense of already uneven power dynamics. One thing is for sure: Hawaiian cuisine and culture are wholly different from Chinese cuisine and culture. The two are not synonymous and to envelope cherry-picked aspects of Hawaiian culture and aesthetics into the fold of Chinese cuisine erases individual identities and divergent historical challenges.
Looking at the complicated entanglement of Chinese Tiki, the concept is hardly an escapist fantasy to tropical paradise. Where are we, as patrons, owners, and critics of Wusong Road, escaping to? And why? The exotic and the Orient, images crafted by oppressive white hands, seems a hellscape I surely do not want to land in. Right in our backyard, Wusong Road provides us with something more than mai tai’s in fancy cups and $8.88 eats. What has arrived is an opportunity to interrogate our own interactions with American imperial history and the food that crossed oceans as a result of this devastating conquest and the colonial project.

By now, seemingly everyone knows of the infamous Elizabeth Holmes. The story of the Silicon Valley visionary who shamelessly defrauded investors at every turn took the world by storm when her biomedical empire, Theranos, came crashing down in 2015. Now, Hulu hopes to capitalize on this global interest with the release of its highly anticipated drama, “The Dropout,” which stars Amanda Seyfried as the con artist once touted as the youngest self-made female billionaire. However, this star-studded attempt to provide a behind-the-scenes look into Holmes’ life has some glaring issues.
The first of three episodes that were added to Hulu on March 3 focuses on Holmes’ short-lived stint at Stanford University before she dropped out in her sophomore year to chase her dream of revolutionizing the biomedical industry. Immediately, this starting point for the story raises a question that will pester viewers throughout the premiere: Am I supposed to believe that Amanda Seyfried looks like a freshman in college?
While there is nothing inherently wrong with actors playing younger people, Seyfried, who is 36 in real life, does not succeed in passing for an 18-year-old. Instead, the result is a jarring discrepancy between the facts of the story and the image on the screen, which ultimately distracts viewers from the show’s better aspects. Unfortunately, the show’s heavy focus on Holmes’ ambition in her young adulthood only exacerbates this uneasy viewing experience.
Age disparity aside, Seyfried does deliver a rather engrossing portrayal of Holmes. Her subtle facial expressions are especially impressive and her imitation of Holmes’ notoriously artificially deep voice is hard to audibly distinguish from a YouTube clip of the Theranos founder herself. Most of all, Seyfried does a wonderful job of capturing Holmes’ evolution as a master of deception, with the scenes of her lying becoming ever more believable throughout the first three episodes.
Sadly, Seyfried’s performance is hindered by what seems to be one of the biggest flaws in this show’s writing: an extreme lack of subtlety. From the very first moment of the show, the dialogue beats viewers over the head with incessant references to Holmes’ ambition, as if it is not obvious from the fact that she started a company at 19 years old. One scene, in which Seyfried manically dances about her bedroom while listening to a song with the lyrics “I’m in a hurry to get things done,” is sure to elicit many eye-rolls. This moment and others when Seyfried screams about her desire to accumulate wealth and status reduce this portrayal to mere caricature.
This lack of subtlety also extends to the show’s attempts to portray Holmes’ lack of social skills. There are several scenes throughout the first three episodes in which Seyfried looks into a mirror and practices for upcoming social interactions; one such sequence shows her trying to perfect her smile in a way that is eerily reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's scene in “Joker.” These purposefully unsettling scenes may be entertaining, but their explicitly villainous undertones border on the exploitative.
Fortunately for viewers, “The Dropout” is hardly devoid of entertainment value. William H. Macy and Laurie Metcalf both make brief but compelling appearances in the first three episodes, and it seems likely that these big-name stars will get more outsized roles as the show goes on. And, like any story about scams of such a large magnitude, there is something intrinsically fascinating about untangling the web of lies that will keep viewers engaged regardless of the series’ cheesy moments. Plus, the third episode ends with a montage set to Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black” which is one of this year’s more clever television moments.
For fans of “The Social Network” who wished the film had ended with Facebook being a billion-dollar hoax, “The Dropout” will be sure to satisfy. But just like Theranos, don’t expect it to change the world.

The American Repertory Theater’s latest theater offering, “Ocean Filibuster” set out with the goal to “depict the reality of the climate crisis” by blurring the lines between entertainment and education. Unfortunately, it lacks clarity at times and loses track of its aim by engaging in tangential commentary. The result is a show that struggles to gain its footing. “Ocean Filibuster” would be better off presenting itself as a challenge to time, boldly commanding it to move slower than it has ever moved before.
Jennifer Kidwell plays “Mr. Majority,” in the show — a run-of-the-mill, allegedly forward-facing politician who presents a bill to a global senate sometime in the future. The bill’s champions hope to dramatically decrease the size of the ocean in an effort to curb natural disasters and have more land. Kidwell also plays Ocean; all of Earth’s waters inexplicably took the form of a human being who unexpectedly arrives to filibuster the bill in order to save itself — and the many creatures that reside in it — from destruction.
A white, vinyl-paneled stage with a dramatic white podium in the center makes it seem as if the audience were a part of the senate, blurring the line between the audience and the performance. The screens on the sides read “Thank you for being here,” “Welcome to the Global Federation of Humans on Earth,” and “Zambiethopia,” although the last name goes unexplained. After a few minutes, these messages give way to scenes of nature projected on the stage’s sides.
This sleek design and the choice to almost include the audience in the show — reinforced by the unceremonious beginning — gives the show the feel of a planetarium. One could be forgiven for expecting a relatively quick, somewhat educational show that manages to both soothe and stimulate, but they would be wrong to do so.
The show is not fully focusing on the main points — that biodiversity is a good thing, humankind relies on the ocean to survive, and the answer to the rise in water-related natural disasters is not to rid the earth of much of the ocean, but instead to cut carbon emissions — which distracts from the message. While the first part of the show makes important statements about gender identity and pronouns — at one point a performer questions whether Mr. Majority’s decision to refer to the ocean as “she” is because the ocean is “something to be conquered” (Ocean says “o” is the preferred pronoun) — the end result is confusing.
The interactive intermission, which further draws the audience into the show, features a series of educational exhibits and an actor who claims to be a cod, explaining the environmental impact of climate change and pollution. Indeed, the show enters so far into the realm of the absurd that one can only go with the flow and find some brief peace.
“Ocean Filibuster” is at least consistent, closing with an “ocean choir” that sings something about whales calling to one another. It is probably meant to be mesmerizing and profound, a fitting end to what is supposed to be a mesmerizing and profound work of art. This scene, too, fails in this respect, coming across as a jumble of unintelligible, high-pitched voices that simulates the experience of entering a disorienting wedding reception.
The show’s numerous flaws aside, there are high points that deserve to be praised. Kidwell makes a valiant effort to keep the audience engaged, deftly switching between her two roles and delivering each line with charisma and conviction. The lighting and stage design — which frequently and arrestingly transition from blinding white to an array of glowing colors and ocean scenes — are quite beautiful and a highlight.

When Heidi Schreck was 15 years old, she paid her way through college by traveling through the United States and winning speech competitions about the U.S. Constitution. 30 years later, Schreck has brought her experience to the stage in the form of a (mostly) one-woman play, “What the Constitution Means to Me.”
Like 15-year-old Schreck, the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-nominated “What the Constitution Means to Me” is benefitting from a national tour. Directed by Oliver Butler, “What the Constitution Means to Me” arrived at Emerson College’s Cutler Majestic Theater on Feb. 22, where it will run until March 20. The show is a funny, thought-provoking piece that both celebrates and criticizes one of the most significant documents in this country’s history.
While Schreck played herself during the show’s original Broadway run, Cassie Beck has now stepped into the role for the national tour. Beck brings a buoyant, breathless energy to her portrayal of a teenage Heidi as she pontificates at a podium, likening the Constitution to a witch’s crucible. Beck’s animated speech is enhanced by Rachel Hauck’s simple set design. Inspired by the American Legion Hall (“It’s reconstructed from my dreams, like one of those crime victim drawings,” Beck says), the walls are covered in portraits of U.S. veterans.
At the start of the play, Heidi asks us to pretend to be the old, white men who judged her speech and debate competitions. She speaks at length about the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, showing how the ideals of equal rights for the people have not, historically, applied to all of the people. Over and over again, the rights of women, people of color, and other marginalized groups have not been protected by the Constitution.
What begins as a high schooler’s speech eventually turns into a personal story about Heidi and the women in her own family, many of whom suffered from depression and were victims of domestic abuse. Beck speaks candidly to the audience as Heidi, bringing both humor and solemnity to the show when they are needed. She switches comfortably between speaking about losing her stuffed monkey at the airport and having an abortion. A recording of Supreme Court justices coughing uncontrollably as they discuss birth control eventually leads into the dizzying statistic that more women have been killed by a male partner since 2000 than Americans have died in wars.
Midway through the play, Beck transitions to speak as the adult version of Heidi. She then leaves the character of Heidi for a while and speaks as herself, telling the audience about her friendship with Schreck and her own relationship with the Constitution. Beck navigates these multiple character changes with ease, giving the audience a sense of intimacy with Heidi’s character and Beck herself. From her first sentence, the audience feels as if they are in a casual conversation with a close friend.
Beck brings to life Schreck’s exceptional writing. Heidi’s speech feels spontaneous, but behind its conversational tone is a tightly-written script. (“In spite of how it feels, this play is quite carefully constructed,” Beck says during the show.) The play manages to weave in nuanced arguments about immigration, abortion rights, and violence against women in one fell swoop.
While most of the show is a monologue by Beck and Beck as Heidi, she is not alone onstage. Gabriel Marin plays the Legionnaire, who counts down Heidi’s allotted time to speak and brings a humorous sense of urgency to the play. Later in the show, Marin also sheds his character and speaks about his own experiences with toxic masculinity.
One of the most entertaining parts of the show comes in its final act. High school debater Emilyn Toffler (who alternates the role with Jocelyn Shek) comes onstage to debate Heidi about whether the Constitution should be kept or abolished. At the end of the debate, an audience member is selected at random to decide the Constitution’s fate.
Although “What the Constitution Means to Me” was first performed in 2017, it still feels prescient today. It speaks clearly to the way that this 200-year-old document still sparks discourse about the United States’ modern issues. “What the Constitution Means to Me” is a remarkable show that both entertains and informs, truly helping the audience understand why the Constitution matters in their everyday lives.

“Dear President Vladimir Putin, I am so sorry that I was not your mother,” AnnaLynne McCord begins her spoken word poem to the President of Russia, who — in case you haven’t seen the Instagram infographics — is in the midst of directing an attack on Ukraine.
What comes next is a nearly two-and-a-half minute performance in which McCord utilizes an elaborate rhyme scheme and a deeply emotional/caring/worried? expression to try and articulate her message: If she had been Putin’s mother, none of this would be happening.
Now, this is a bold take, but McCord continues, “If I was your mother, you would have been so loved / Held in the arms of joyous light / Never would this story's plight / The world unfurled before our eyes.”
Essentially, it seems to come down to the idea that President Putin was a deeply unloved and underappreciated child. For that reason, he’s having a not-so-little meltdown that happens to include launching an attack on a sovereign nation. If only spoken word poetry could end wars.
This video — originally posted by McCord to Twitter — now has over 31 million views. As one might imagine, the reactions haven’t exactly been positive. McCord has been trolled online since she originally posted the video on Feb. 24. Despite the negative feedback, she’s not backing down.
In defending her choice, McCord told Buzzfeed News, “If certain circumstances of my life were different, were I a little less bent toward healing and more toward vindication, I could have been a darkly powerful person.”
More than an interesting statement, it’s also a trivializing one. McCord is not a male Russian politician who has held onto a presidency for 10 years, and painting herself as such deeply minimizes the social, economic, and political factors that have shaped this unfortunate reality. From her position of privilege as a white American actress, it’s inappropriate for her to claim she can solve a complex global crisis.
While the tragedy of Ukraine is far from a direct parallel, McCord’s actions serve as a reminder of the many times in which celebrities chose to weigh in on tragedy. Consider Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi commercial against police brutality or the celebrity montage cover of The Beatles’s “Imagine” at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the Pepsi ad, Jenner rips off a blond wig, smears her makeup, and walks through a Black Lives Matter protest to hand a police officer a Pepsi. Unrealistically, her bold decision is then followed by everyone erupting into ecstatic cheers. The celebrity montage video has a lower production value, with celebrities recording themselves on their phones, but that’s what makes it even more cringeworthy. Celebrities singing at home in quarantine — they’re just like us, right? No. The video revealed that they are horribly out of touch as they believed that their video could alleviate the immense and layered pain caused by the pandemic.
These equally painful-to-watch instances of celebrities overestimating their importance point towards a deeper theme of believing that virtue signaling from absurdly wealthy people will solve deeply entrenched issues. In times of extreme unrest or pain, celebrities often make this move of surface-level engagement but fail to acknowledge the greater systems of oppression at play. Their misunderstanding of the problem then fails to alleviate any pain, but then they trivialize it or create a comedic spectacle, as these videos have all done. McCord’s performance thus perpetuates an overall erasure of the histories and realities that lead to such dire situations and fails to provide any active remedy.

Against the cheery yellow walls of a downstairs Lowell studio room, the cast and crew of this year’s Lowell House Opera production “Nighttown” rehearse a reimagining of the “Circe” chapter from James Joyce’s seminal work “Ulysses.” The production brings to life the complicated relationship between Leopold and Molly Bloom as seen through Molly’s perspective, which remains largely underdeveloped in the novel.
Chapter 15, also known as the “Circe” chapter, reimagines an episode from Homer’s “Odyssey” where the sorceress Circe drugs Odysseus’s men and turns them into pigs. In “Ulysses,” Circe is embodied by Bella Cohen, a brothel owner in 1904 Dublin’s redlight district called Nighttown. Joyce’s protagonist Leopold Bloom follows his young friend Stephen Dedalus into Cohen’s brothel, where a series of drink-induced hallucinatory sequences unfold.
After receiving a commission from Lowell House Opera in Nov. 2019, composer, librettist, and music director Benjamin “Benjy” P. Wenzelberg ’22 developed “Nighttown” as his senior thesis with the help of English department faculty. But adapting a text as formidable and renowned as “Ulysses” is no easy feat.
According to Wenzelberg, what makes the text appealing for the opera is its sonic quality. “Joyce does this amazing thing where often words don’t only have a lot of meaning in terms of what they refer to, but even on the level of how they sound,” he said.
This hidden lyricism in Joyce’s prose not only lends a musicality to the text but also informs Wenzelberg’s approach to composing the music for the opera. “I've used the natural rhythm and inflection of Joyce's words, and in many cases my own words, to inform the musical language of the piece,” Wenzelberg said, alluding to a particular scene in “Nighttown” where the music mimics the ticking of a clock and eventually evolves into the phrase “Nighttown” and “Come inside.”
Although the original chapter focuses on Leopold Bloom, Lowell House Opera’s “Nighttown” places Molly and her emotional response to Leopold’s actions at center stage. The decision to retell the story through Molly’s point of view was a practical one. Chapter 15 integrates the narratives of many key characters in the novel and provides a multiplicity of voices that Wenzelberg wanted to capture in his reimagining of the tale. One character, however, remained largely unexplored.
“While I wanted to use the 15th chapter as an opportunity for all of these narratives to collide, Molly only really appears in very problematic attire and portrayal at points in the 15th chapter. It’s still very much Bloom’s story, and so Molly, I just felt needed to become part of chapter 15 in her own words,” Wenzelberg said. To that end, he also incorporates Molly’s soliloquy at the end of the novel into the lyrics of “Nighttown.”
The centering of Molly’s perspective is part of what drew actors Caroline Olsen (Molly Bloom) and Erin Merceruio Nelson (Nymph) to the production in the first place. “It’s interesting to see how Benjy is able to turn the ‘Odyssey’ on its head and turn it into an emotional odyssey for Molly,” Olsen said.
While Wenzelberg first read “Ulysses” in Harvard’s Humanities 10 course during his freshman year, many of the cast and crew had never read the book. In some ways, their unfamiliarity with the text served as a test for the opera’s comprehensibility and emotional resonance. “It was important to me that people who hadn’t read the novel felt emotionally connected to the piece, and I can guarantee they will,” said Adrienne Boris, “Nighttown”’s executive producer and stage director.
Still, Boris finds that she is able to connect with Joyce’ words through her own directing. “I think that Benjy has done a great job of channeling both Homer and Joyce, and when I create a physical moment that really lands, I feel like it reverberates in a sort of triptych — like we’re adding to the palimpsest. There are moments that feel very deeply based in the themes and logic of ‘Ulysses’ and in the ancient quest for home,” Boris said.
Of course, no production is immune to the challenges presented by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and “Nighttown” is no exception. “Performing with masks does create some limitations in our ability to tell what is an intimate story,” said David McFerrin, who plays Leopold Bloom.
Boris agrees and adds that faking kissing or otherwise representing intimate moments on stage with masks “is just not believable.”
Despite these setbacks, Boris finds that the pandemic has presented an added relevance to the story and themes that “Nighttown” portrays. “This central tension between being unable to recognize grief or process grief, but being exhausted and scared to do so … all of that became more relevant through Covid,” Boris said.
“I like to think of this piece as one that looks forward more than it looks back,” Wenzelberg said, further reflecting on the relevance of “Nighttown” to a contemporary audience. “This is a reflection of a lot of love and loss that we’ve all experienced during Covid, but also the catharsis and outlook it provides is the most 2022 thing I can think of.”

Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for “Legacies,” as well as minor references to overarching events in “The Vampire Diaries” and “The Originals.”
The mid-season premiere of “Legacies” this Thursday was emblematic of the series as a whole: lots of potential hampered by underutilized characters and clunky drama. While Season Four has been one of the strongest seasons of the “The Vampire Diaries” spinoff yet — with Hope (Danielle Rose Russell) finally becoming a full Tribrid and the long-overdue conclusion of the seasons-long struggle against Malivore earlier this season — the show’s ongoing structural issues continue to hold it back.
Now that Malivore has finally been defeated, the mid-season premiere introduces some new antagonists: “the gods.” While some people may enjoy watching “Legacies” butcher Greek mythology, they are going to have to do a lot of work to explain how the gods are different from the other powerful characters we have already seen, like the Originals or even Tribrid Hope. “The Vampire Diaries” already had the literal devil on the show, so “Legacies” writers going to need to offer a better explanation than magic to make “the gods” a credible threat.
Faced with a god for the first time, Hope continues to be snarky and exasperated, relying heavily on her new Tribrid abilities. She has always been a fundamentally good character who has known a lot of pain and grief, so it’s fascinating to see her embrace her darker urges now that her humanity is off. It’s frustrating that the narrative won’t let her follow through on her violent threats more often: This reluctance ultimately undermines the powerful image the show tries to build of her. Hope has made a lot of mistakes lately, so hopefully, her journey to find her humanity again will be meaningful and allow her to grow from the overpowered martyr figure she was in previous seasons.
The minor characters of “Legacies” suffer similarly from stunted character growth. Sequences showing Landon (Aria Shahghasemi), Alaric (Matthew Davis), and Ted (Ben Geurens) blundering around in purgatory feature repetitive, shallow pep talks as Landon continues to prove that he is the most mature of the bunch despite being the youngest. “The Vampire Diaries” and “The Originals” excelled at giving characters meaningful send-offs. “Legacies,” on the other hand, relies on insisting dead characters continue to be on the show without actually accomplishing anything, thus undoing any emotional impact their deaths had. And, frankly, it’s boring to watch. Similarly, the characters on the ground at the Salvatore School are consistently underutilized. MG’s (Quincy Fouse) storyline about becoming a better leader would have a lot of potential if the episodes didn’t throw out self-contained, contradictory, and ham-fisted lessons every few episodes when they remember his character exists.
In fact, while the Salvatore School was a good entry point for “Legacies,” its high school setting now holds the series back. “The Vampire Diaries” also suffered from the limitation of having an almost exclusively high school-aged cast, but it also had a better awareness of how to expand the story as the characters moved onto college by Season Five. The pacing of the show is also generally nonsensical, as the show’s events are so condensed that there’s no sense of forward momentum. Furthermore, the school’s many conflicts — like a lack of money and unsatisfied parents — consistently feel contrived.
Where the characters are supposed to be in their lives both existentially and emotionally is often muddy. One of the reasons “The Originals” was such a success was because the characters had clear motivations and complex, layered relationships with each other. The villains all had a personal grudge against the protagonists and the characters went through big transformations every season. In “Legacies,” though, it’s impossible to tell what any character wants at a given moment — other than protecting the person they started dating two episodes ago. Characters swap opinions and passions like it’s nothing, and it’s hard to care about a character when their journey is so unfocused.
Unlike writer and producer Julie Plec’s other vampire shows, “Legacies” has generally followed a monster-of-the-week structure, with a self-contained story that also supports an overarching arc. While this formula can work, it means the show sometimes functions as a supernatural teen sitcom. Indeed, the show’s strongest episodes have been the wacky, out-of-the-box installments that deviate from the show’s premise — the Star Wars homage, the noir murder mystery, the ’80s video game, and the summer camp horror were all standout episodes. While “Legacies” can feature great episodes when something lasting or impactful finally happens, too much of each season is drawn out as though the writers are afraid to create real stakes for the plot.
It is unlikely there will be a fourth spin-off of “The Vampire Diaries,” so this is a great opportunity for the franchise to do something exciting. “Legacies” as a series has fantastic potential, so here’s hoping the rest of the fourth season can continue its upward trajectory.

Imagine: You’re in Walt Disney World for the first time. You’ve been saving for this trip for years, and you’re ecstatic to finally bask beneath the Florida sun. You and your party of five have just entered Hollywood Studios, one of the resort’s four theme parks, and you can’t wait to visit the new “Star Wars” area that has everyone buzzing. After spending all that money, you can’t believe you actually made it to the big day. But wait — your party wants to ride the most popular Star Wars attraction? That’ll be another $75.
This is the unfortunate reality of the Disney Genie Plus Service, a ride reservation system that debuted at Walt Disney World in Oct. 2021. The system, which replaces the FastPass Plus service that had operated at the parks for many years, requires guests to pay for “Lightning Lane” reservations in order to experience rides with a reduced wait time. While the advent of Lightning Lane has caused an undoubted frenzy among Disney-goers, it is only the latest in a recent series of monetizing moves by the Mouse House. Disgruntled fans have largely associated this trend with CEO Bob Chapek, who has certainly earned a profit-pushing reputation since his appointment in Feb. 2020. In a memo to Disney staff at the start of 2022, Chapek outlined three pillars for the company: “First, storytelling excellence… second, innovation… and third, relentless focus on our audience.” While these goals are admirable on the surface, a closer look at Disney’s track record in recent years will show that the company’s cash-grab mentality works opposite to each one these purported pillars.
First, “storytelling excellence.” In the beginning, there was nothing. Then, there was Disney Plus. Disney’s undeniably popular streaming service burst onto the scene in Nov. 2019, fresh with content from across Disney’s media empire — Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and more. As expected, this content base attracted subscribers rapidly, achieving a count of 50 million subscribers within five months of its debut. In recognition of this success, The Walt Disney Company reorganized its business divisions in favor of such direct-to-consumer channels in Oct[ober][.] 2020. However, this focus on Disney Plus has led to an excessive prioritization of the service, even as movie theaters have begun to regain prominence; for instance, the latest three releases by Pixar — “Soul,” “Luca,” and now this month’s “Turning Red” — have all been Disney Plus exclusives.
This trend toward exclusive virtual showings, however, doesn’t seem to be strictly for pandemic-related reasons alone; Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Raya and the Last Dragon” debuted both in theaters and on Disney Plus (for an additional fee of $30) in March 2021, before the releases of both “Luca” and “Turning Red.” Given Pixar films’ tendency to receive greater acclaim than Walt Disney Animation Studios’, Disney’s recent habit of limiting Pixar films to Disney Plus may be a strategy to retain a robust subscriber stream for the company’s hottest commodity. Evidently, Disney’s business-driven outlook has begun to interfere with the ways in which its stories are experienced, which certainly complicates the proper execution of “storytelling excellence.” While the company hopefully isn’t likely to lose the creators behind its stories that are adored by so many, it is upsetting to see optimal modes of storytelling disrespected in favor of a focus on numbers.
Second, “innovation.” Disney theme parks have been fully transformed by technology in recent years. Once upon a time, guests would have to print a FastPass ticket from a physical kiosk and present it upon arriving at a ride. This process has become completely digitized, though, to the point where 2021 even saw the debut of a virtual itinerary-maker — Disney Genie — which aims to craft a visitor’s day in the theme park according to their interests. The introduction of this function was accompanied by the aforementioned Disney Genie Plus Service, which replaces FastPass Plus and allows guests to make Lightning Lane reservations. Whereas the ability to make FastPass Plus reservations was included with park admission, Lighting Lane privileges can be purchased for $15 per day, and some rides — like “Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance” — even require individual fees.
Disney Genie and the Disney Genie Plus Service have been cleverly marketed in tandem as a great innovation for the parks, but in reality, they are far from it. Compared to the clear infrastructure of the FastPass Plus system, which allowed guests to make three ride reservations prior to park entry, Lightning Lane reservations can only be made on the day of a visit, and guests may only make one reservation until they either go on that ride — or wait for a period of two hours. Ultimately, it seems that Lightning Lane is merely FastPass Plus with a new name, far less efficiency, and a greater cost.
Finally, “relentless focus on our audience.” When Walt Disney came up with the idea for Disneyland, his vision was very much family-oriented. As he watched his daughters ride a merry-go-round, Walt imagined a place “where parents and children could have fun together.” If the new Star Wars resort at Walt Disney World is anything to gauge by, the company is losing sight of its founder’s vision more and more every day. The resort, which exclusively offers guests a two-night experience, is called “Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser,” and its price tag for a family of four is a whopping $5,999. This designation is undoubtedly a remarkably high ask for the average family, making it abundantly clear that the people whom Walt wanted to engage with his creations are gradually having that opportunity stripped from them. If anything, the company appears to be relentlessly focused on turning away the audience it has held dear for so long.
If the Walt Disney Company sticks to its habit of choosing money over magic, fan disillusionment is sure to persist as well. In a telling example of such sentiment, a constituent of Disney shareholders has threatened to vote against Bob Chapek’s re-election as CEO at an annual shareholder meeting to be held March 9. And while it’s true that no one person should be blamed for the company’s recent actions, its behavior is perhaps best encapsulated by a nickname for Chapek that has quickly gained traction on the internet: Bob Paycheck.

It’s queer, it’s high-stakes, it’s… taken a religious turn?
The season four premiere of “Killing Eve” aired on Feb. 27, reuniting loyal fans with psychopath Villanelle (Jodie Comer) and obsessive intelligence agent Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). The first episode of the final season was defined by a surprising reversal of roles as Eve becomes the season’s newest villain and Villanelle attempts to shed her lethal past and seek salvation in Christ. Though these out-of-character portrayals and other unconvincing moments are initially disappointing, enough of the duo’s familiar, alluring bad habits peek through their good girl/bad girl facades to make the episode interesting — hopefully promising a return to the women’s obsessive dynamic that warrants sticking with the final season.
In an apparent homage to characteristic Villanelle fashion, the episode opens with a woman in a skin-tight motorcycle suit, brandishing a gun and forcing her way into a Russian government building. The only difference? It’s not Villanelle at all — it’s Eve. She confronts Konstantin (Kim Bodnia), who now appears to be a small-town mayor, and proceeds to shoot him in the hand. Not only is Eve’s portrayal out of character and not entirely convincing, it’s overshadowed by the confusion this scene raises. Given no explanation as to how a man that was, as of the season three finale, involved in an all-powerful terrorist organization and almost executed is suddenly a small-town mayor, viewers are left with more questions than answers. Unfortunately, this seems to be a theme throughout the premiere.
Set almost entirely in Russia, episode one is devoid of the many idyllic European landscapes and bustling cities that fill the background of prior seasons. Beyond aesthetic considerations, however, the setting raises some logistical questions. When Villanelle is able to leave her Baptism (yes, the same Villanelle who has spent three seasons killing without a trace of remorse is getting Baptized), pop in to see Eve unannounced, and return to the church all in a matter of hours, viewers are left to wonder where these women are situated geographically and why they are so close. There is a lingering sense of disappointment as well: As the allure of “Killing Eve” lies in the chase, Villanelle showing up at Eve’s hotel with little effort and minimal conflict doesn’t do justice to the intricate game of cat and mouse fans have followed for three seasons.
Eve continues to investigate the Twelve — the top-secret terrorist organization that formerly employed Villanelle — under the guise of working for a private investigation company. While she is joined in this venture with a new co-worker and romantic interest Yusuf (Robert Gilbert), Villanelle seeks salvation in the Church. She takes refuge in the home of a priest and his daughter May (Zindzi Hudson) who seems to be the new object of Villanelle’s desire. At a family dinner with the two, Villanelle sports a tie-dyed “What Would Jesus Do?” T-shirt and a gold cross around her neck while serving loaves of bread and fish. Though Villanelle’s transformation has the potential to be a compelling change of pace, scenes like this one are almost too on the nose.
Because it is in such stark contrast to past seasons, the incongruity of Villanelle’s transformation into a devout Christian eclipses Eve’s own character development throughout the episode. If they weren’t occurring parallel to one another, perhaps the viewer might give more pause to moments when Eve tells Yusuf how good it felt to shoot Konstantin or when, upon Villanelle showing up unannounced and trying to demonstrate she’s changed, Eve slaps her across the face.
While both transformations are unsettling for characters who have historically seemed so set in their ways, the extremes of Villanelle’s new persona are especially unnerving and at times feel like a letdown — who is Villanelle if not evil? Who is Eve if not obsessively tracking down Villanelle? Lucky for us, though, old habits die hard. As Villanelle’s possessive personality and violent tendencies break through the facade she’s created, Eve’s own obsession with the Twelve is rekindled when Carolyn (Fiona Shaw) brings her new evidence. Perhaps these new personalities aren’t as concrete as the writers would like us to believe.
The premiere of “Killing Eve”’s final season asks viewers to refrain from asking questions when plot points aren’t given adequate explanation and to place a certain amount of trust in the show’s writers as its two protagonists undergo significant transformations. While such stark changes and unconvincing moments throughout may put viewers off, seeing Eve and Villanelle fall into old habits is nevertheless promising. Fans of the show should suspend disbelief for maybe a bit longer, if only to see Eve and Villanelle back at it in their obsessive, dramatic, queer game of cat and mouse.

With intrigue, adventure, and an eye-drawing cast list, Ruben Fleischer’s “Uncharted” takes on the task of bringing a popular video game to the big screen — and the result is disappointing.
The highly anticipated film showcases Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg)’s recruitment of Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) to locate the coveted treasure left by Ferdinand Magellan. Along their journey, the duo encounters obstacles in the form of mysteries and scavenger hunts as well as danger through Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) and Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) — two female antiheroes intent on acquiring wealth without sharing.
While “Uncharted” had the opportunity to display Holland’s acting range, the underdeveloped script — notably the biggest hindrance to the movie’s success — renders it nearly impossible for him to realize his potential. Writers had the opportunity to deepen the character arc of the well-known video game character, an all-knowledgeable historian and explorer. However, most of Holland’s appearances fell short of being memorable, with his performance in the movie frequently relying on his ability to execute complex action sequences.
Holland fits well in the role of Nathan Drake, largely because of his successful execution of these stunts. The seamless execution of these stunts was remarkable, making them one of the major highlights of the film. Throughout the video games, Drake uses his historical knowledge and adventuring expertise to find the treasure he is after. Through this lens, it makes sense that the focus of the film should be on Drake’s skill — and Holland succeeds at highlighting this expertise in fighting. However, Drake in this film, while having the opportunity to be a remarkable character capable of solving any problem, feels stale as a character. Holland’s Drake falls short of the confident explorer version of Drake from the video games. As a result, the movie presents a hesitant Drake who tends to live in his brother’s shadow, resulting in a flat and underwhelming version of the well-known action character.
The promise of seeking riches beyond one’s dreams is a familiar movie trope that requires a niche perspective to distinguish it from others. “Uncharted” fails at this task, blending in alongside many other adventure-focused films. As such, the plot is an expected, stale take on the betrayal trope of adventure movies. The film broadcasts seemingly endless cycles of betrayal and expected “surprises” that leave viewers wondering about their significance to the plot.
Although the script falls short, Holland and Wahlberg’s dynamic makes a lasting impression and carries the dialogue of the film. Both characters seem to tap into their mentor-mentee relationship, a dynamic that gives the film much-needed comic relief. Mark Wahlberg’s appearance in the movie adds further depth to Holland’s character, providing vital plot points through his dialogue that Holland subsequently follows. Overall, Wahlberg successfully performs his character when Holland’s appearance becomes stale. In contrast to Holland’s unexciting portrayal of Drake, Wahlberg is able to deliver striking dialogue and saucy banter with Holland that presents him as a believable money-hungry and manipulative treasure seeker. Wahlberg’s compelling portrayal of the selfish explorer that grows to put behind his greedy motives and befriend Drake adds depth to the character of Sully — and provides new insights into the original game character.
Despite disappointments in the film’s dialogue and performances, the visuals through the sets of the film are stunning. Starting the movie in medias res could have been unsuccessful for the film, but it was a surprisingly refreshing way to engage the audience from starting with Holland’s stunt sequences and later tying back to this scene through an exciting full-circle fight sequence. The recurring images, such as a seemingly unimportant vintage red car that ends up hitting Holland out of a plane, work to enhance the details of the set design. Most notably, the film’s climax takes place with two Magellan ships docked in an idyllic grotto that get lifted into the air, with the characters fighting on these moving ships. These impressive scenes of picturesque rock islands turning into a battlefield vitalize the already stunning visual images seen throughout the film.
Though “Uncharted” has a mix of high and low points, most of these were forgettable after heading out of the theater. Most regrettably, the film fails to take advantage of the opportunity to add depth to the plot and characters of the video games — ones that have yet to be seen by fans of the games. Regardless, fans of the original game can be sure to get excited about future films. Featuring a post-credit scene that unsurprisingly alluded to a sequel, it is clear that cinema will see more of the “Uncharted” franchise for years to come.

Harvard’s Kardashian Lifestyle Klub — an organization dedicated to celebrating the lavish lifestyle of the Kardashian family — introduced themselves to campus with an inaugural event on March 3 that featured a lavish ballroom, an ABC film crew, and wellness-inspired activities.
Club founder and Currier House tutor Kristen Starkowksi explained that she had originally started the club during her time at Princeton. Given the opportunity to direct student programming at Currier, Starkowski thought the club would be a great way to promote mental well-being among Harvard’s students.
“The club came out of talking to a ton of people who are fans — and appreciating the spontaneous and fun things that the Kardashians do. We all need a little break from the rigors of academic life. Let's just do something silly,” Starkowski said.
Abigail Lockhart-Calpito ‘23, a member of the club, said:
“The party favors and the decor and everything are definitely not what I was expecting. I think it's great. It's not something that you experience every day at Harvard, and I feel like it's fitting for the subject.”
Indeed, the Sheraton Crystal Ballroom, where the event was held, was a dramatic break from the rigors of Harvard’s academia. The ballroom had been transformed into the likes of Pinkalicious’s fantasy — pink LED lights lined the crystal chandeliers, pink satin cloth covered the tables, and pink balloons in the shape of K’s and XO’s floated above the crowd. A table in the corner boasted a cornucopia of Kardashian-themed foods, drinks, and gifts. The focal point of the ballroom, though, was a projector playing an episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.”
Starkowski explained that the Kardashian Lifestyle Klub garnered national attention at Princeton, enabling her to meet Kourtney Kardashian. ABC is following interest in Kardashian family matters at Ivy League institutions.
Students seated themselves at the tables and amused themselves with Kardashian coloring books and stickers, occasionally stealing glances at the ABC film crew capturing the event. Starkowski herself was wearing a microphone the entire night as part of the filming process.
After students stopped filing in, Starkowski explained the club’s goals and introduced the planned activities. “The Harvard lifestyle can be really demanding, right?” Starkowski said. “So let’s all just take a break and do fun things — that's what this is all about. Tonight there's a lot of activities planned.”
The first activity was inspired by the moment Kim Kardashian lost her diamond earring. Starkowski challenged students to find an earring hidden in the ballroom for a prize. Students stalked around the ballroom, their eyes glued to the ground, attempting to find the earring. After several table cloths were lifted and decorations rearranged, one student emerged victorious and was awarded a Kardashian-themed prize.
The next challenges revolved around the Kardashians’ food quirks, including replicating Kourtney’s bizarre Kit-Kat-eating technique and Khloé’s impressive Oreo cookie jar. Laughter resonated around the ballroom as contestants nibbled around the edges of their Kit-Kats and attempted to build the tallest and most visually appealing stack of Oreos possible.
The final challenge was to attribute quotes to the correct Kardashian family member. Starkowski read quotes aloud, and students clamored over one another in their attempts to say the correct Kardashian first. In many instances, Starkowski would barely get two words out before loyal fans were able to correctly guess the Kardashian family member.
Students reflected on how the Kardashians are separate from reality in many ways, just as the Kardashian Lifestyle Klub intends to separate itself from academic life at Harvard. Caroline Gage ‘25, another attendee, stated that “They seem like they're in a complete other world sometimes. I guess that can be a problem. But also, it provides great entertainment and escapism.”
Ultimately, students agreed that the influence of the Kardashian family won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.
Diarra Faye ‘24 echoed this sentiment: “As problematic as they are, they're very iconic. I don't know, they make their way of standing out to the world.”

Harvard Square is unfamiliar to me. T0 many, Harvard and its surrounding area are the locus of education, student life, tourism, and good times. Many revisit to relive their glory days, soak in the colonial architecture of the Yard, or learn about scholarship of the past and innovations of tomorrow. But I have come to this place, met with some of the world's brightest minds, next world leaders, dreamers, achievers, changemakers — and to me it has never been more than a place without the beauty supply store.
And yes, I know, it sounds really shallow.
I sit in my childhood home and from every window in every direction I can tell you of a beauty supply store — affectionately known to me as the hair store — that is not more than 10 minutes away. They are staples in the communities that surround them, suppliers of all things hair and personal care, but mostly, it was the place where I went to figure out who I was and who I wanted to be.
I now look out the window from my Harvard dorm room, and when I search for the road to myself in every direction, I don’t know which way to go. And I yearn for a reminder that I belong here.
The beauty supply store is a place not just about sales, but also about learning respect for, love for, and agency over my own body — starting from the very roots that grow from my head. It was there for me before Solange rejected having her hair touched over a neo soul melody, before Beyoncé declared she liked her “baby heir with baby hair and afros”, before Miranda Bailey taught Derek Shepherd about Zola’s kitchen on Grey’s Anatomy, before pulling girls’ weaves and “yaga”s became pop culture phenomena. It was always the place where I could go to find the supplies that would nurture the expression of my soul.
For Black women, hair has always been serious business. Historically, it's a sacred cultural and spiritual symbol. We fashion our hair for more than just style, but rather as demonstrations of our individual essences and signifiers of Black culture. The appearance of our hair is often taken as a statement about who we are, who we think we are, and who we want to be. And like many other things tied to Black culture, Black people’s — particularly Black women’s — hair is knotted and tangled in issues of race, politics, popular culture, history, and questions of self-worth. And it’s no secret that eurocentric beauty standards for hair — long, thick, straight or particular forms of curly— have for generations been deemed the adequate down payment on the American Dream. Because in America, to fit into a cherished ideal is to fit into normative white perspectives and aesthetics on what’s professional, or better yet, what’s beautiful.
But a neighborhood that lacks convenience for minority hair care products is one that I believe has failed its inhabitants. It insinuates that there is no importance in predominantly-white towns being able to provide minority residents with daily essentials that meet our own personal preferences. What’s more, is that it pushes forth the narrative that people of color — most often Black people  — must compromise their identity to satisfy others. It’s a microaggressive way to emphasize our ever-standing position as central to American culture whilst perennially marginalized by it.
The hair store is more than a store. It’s more than just beauty supplies sold in the name of vanity. It is a cultural and community center. It is a place with the power to create and support important foundational experiences — from finding oneself in the ’fro, to falling in silky love with yourself under a new hair scarf or bonnet, to choosing the right style and colors for your next braided hairdo, or maybe picking up the right brand of deodorant, body wash, hair mask, or lip gloss. Trivial as these moments may seem, it’s in those instances that Black women have the access and ability to exercise agency over the way we choose to express ourselves, and with which styles, products, and personal care we intend to do so.
A hair store could make Harvard feel a bit more like home. At the very least, it would let me know that there is some semblance of belonging for those that look like me in the surrounding community, after all.
I hope to see a beauty supply store make its way into Harvard Square sometime soon. Put it on the short-list of Harvard Square community necessities — right next to a McDonald’s.

Out of the many things we lost when we were instructed to vacate campus in March 2020, the loss of Housing Day by just three days is one that is still sorely felt. For many students currently on campus, Housing Day traditions are merely college lore, like whatever it is that goes on in the Stacks or the so-called humor magazine that a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization slides under our doors in the dead of night.
This year, however, marks a long-anticipated shift from the monotony of virtual celebrations and make-up traditions that, despite our best efforts, could never quite live up to pre-pandemic standards: We are having an in-person Housing Day, and we couldn’t be more grateful. On March 10th, we look forward to coming together as a community to celebrate and welcome the Class of 2025 into their new homes.
We know that this Housing Day won’t be identical to the ones prior to the pandemic — not that most of our peers, particularly freshmen, have a helpful reference point to compare to. Amid surging cases in the undergraduate community, the administration has opted for smaller, masked dorm-storming squads of upperclassmen to mitigate Covid-19 risks. Celebrations will be confined to hallways, rather than actual rooms; stormers and new house members will have only five minutes to rejoice inside before being forced to disperse.
But after the pains of our collective departure, the isolation of more than a year away, and the repeated fits and starts of a hopeful but gradual return, these differences represent at worst a minor inconvenience. This coming Thursday has tremendous potential to reinvigorate our community right on the anniversary of its collapse. Yet that potential will remain just that, an unfulfilled possibility, unless we step up and bring it to fruition. It is up to us to make or break this Housing Day.
Granted, the last few years of virtual Housing Day have left us without a sizeable chunk of our institutional memory: details and specifics that graduated along with those upperclassmen who never returned to a full density campus after the first March 1oth. Traditions we always assumed would be passed on organically got lost or distorted in our collective absence, unwitnessed or unknown by our younger cohorts. Campus culture predictably withered without a campus.
Two years down the pandemic road, only students who started among the class of ’22 and before have any tangible sense of what an in-person Housing Day felt like. The rest of us have lived it only through vicarious, digital means, watching old Harvard Youtube vlogs or binging Housing Day videos while doing a virtual river run on Google street view with our scattered blocking groups on Zoom.
But what has been gone is not entirely forgotten— and from what has been lost we are presented with an opportunity.
We often critique our campus culture and all its exclusionary social scenes. This Housing Day, freshmen and upperclassmen alike will receive something less tangible but more valuable than simple house allotments: a chance to act on our concerns and critiques, to change campus for the better. The bottled-up energy of the past few months — the excitement over re-densification, the joys of Harvard-Yale — should be channeled into making this Housing Day a particularly festive and regenerative moment for everyone. One of the rare joys of our sometimes anxiety-inducing, perenially exhausting campus community is precisely its self-renewing character. Our collective togetherness can be constantly redefined and recreated as we see fit, nudging it towards compassion at every step, generation after generation, class after class. Sometimes, the act of maintenance itself is also a repeated act of creation.
Our roles within this community are constantly changing, too. Many of us entered Harvard as newcomers, dazed and eager to take in all that it has to offer; many of us have benefited greatly from the efforts of upperclassmen, specifically House Committee individuals, to make sure that there is at least one community we feel welcome in. Our transition from Boston-stranded strangers to experienced community members may not have gone exactly how we envisioned it, but it is one that has happened and should be acknowledged. We are beyond grateful for the people that have made Harvard home for us — even when extenuating circumstances have made it extremely difficult to do so.
With that in mind: Upperclassmen, take this day as your own too!
Celebrate for all the years you missed and give the first-years the wholesome welcoming that your screen-based reception didn’t provide. Celebrate the growth you have had at Harvard by being a trustworthy upperclassman to the first-years the same way an upperclassman (or their camera-off Zoom avatar) was for you. Pass on the joy — or, lacking any joy to pass after years of stale digital cheers, nourish some to gift the Class of 2025. This Housing Day is a revival as much as it is a debut: We are reviving a beloved tradition, and we are creating one that is unique to our circumstances.
This Thursday morning — or, for the bold running types, this Wednesday night —  marks the beginning of a newly promising era. We encourage you to treat it that way. Please, go have plenty of responsible, at-times masked fun. Wear your House colors with pride, cheer loudly, binge Housing Day videos. Lend a shoulder to anyone who gets sorted into the Quad, and make sure to take a shot at getting into a River House — if you know what we mean.
Become the community we all missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone knows that scars tell stories. What we often overlook is that emotional scars tell stories, too.
I have many emotional scars, marks from past events — and I don’t just mean from that one time I thought it’d be a great idea to write 15 pages of my final paper on the due date.
If you see me outside my dorm room, I’m almost definitely wearing my Harvard ID on a lanyard. That’s an emotional scar. If you see me awkwardly standing at a door, trying to calm my anxiety about opening the door and probably looking like an eavesdropper in the process, that’s an emotional scar.
I’ll reiterate that I don’t want pity. Pity is actively detrimental to progress, especially when it comes to disability, an escape mechanism allowing people to disassociate themselves from problems while maintaining their sense of comfort. I don’t want sympathy, but empathy.
As obvious as my physical scars may be, people usually can’t see most of them — all the way down my back and around my legs, all the IV marks that are too small to notice. Likewise, very few people know I’m visually impaired unless I tell them, because the natural instinct is to see my walker and stop there, assuming I don’t also have any disabilities that can’t be seen. And while I can’t speak to it, I need to acknowledge the unique challenges those whose disabilities are all invisible face, such as people doubting their disability.
We need to acknowledge invisibility. For me, invisibility comes at 11 p.m., the time of night when I’m alone in my dorm room. In some ways, being alone is freeing. I can do my homework while listening to my favorite video game music, or  pretend to do my homework without actually doing it, or abandon any pretense of doing it and have a staring contest with my Kirby plushie instead (I’ll win someday).
But also, at 11 p.m. I’m alone, and being alone is freeing, and that means thinking.
Being disabled isn’t great for mental health. In high school, when I first started reflecting about my condition, I internalized something obvious: I couldn’t do everything that my classmates did, at least not in the same way as they did. I couldn’t do athletics or build machines or get an entry-level job. There were two things I could do just as well, or occasionally better, than everyone else: academics and video games. I put everything I had, my whole self-purpose, into them.
Disabled people face simultaneously low and high expectations. When someone sees I’m disabled, there is an inevitable subconscious assumption that I’m incompetent. My default state is needing to prove myself to everyone I meet, from friends to interviewers, or else I risk falling into stereotypes of what disabled people are. Yet, the moment I prove myself, I become an “exception” and a “model,” and I become trapped in high expectations that serve to differentiate me from “other disabled people” — who are perceived as unsuccessful largely because they aren’t given the environment and support they need to succeed.
In high school, every A- I got stung, as did every question I answered wrong in class, everything that wasn’t perfect. Societal ableist attitudes led me to doubt my skills and question whether I had any worth or self-purpose.
Constantly wearing my ID on a lanyard is convenient, but the real reason I do it is out of insecurity, so my classmates recognize me as a Harvard student — in many of their eyes, I know I don’t look like one. I think about that at night.
At the same time as I try to make myself seem strong, I feel like a burden to other people. In high school, I was afraid of talking to people in case they were only being nice to me out of pity, and they didn’t want me around. Imposing myself on others scares me, since because of the way disabled people are generally treated, I’m conditioned to think that I’m not worth it.
I eventually learned that most people genuinely did want to talk with me. But I’m still sensitive about it, terrified of overstepping others’ boundaries. If I’m standing outside a room, staring awkwardly at the closed door, it’s not because I’m eavesdropping, but because I’m irrationally anxious about bothering others. I think about that at night.
At 11 p.m., I think about these things, and what is invisible becomes perceptible. But no one is around to know. Of course, everyone has experiences — emotional scars, reasons why they do what they do — that others don’t know about, but it is exactly because of this universality that the point becomes so important: Disability cannot be reduced to a mechanical inconvenience, of needing to find convoluted accessible entrances or to magnify small text.
Living a disabled life means that disability forms part of my identity, shaping the experience of my life in a meaningful way beyond what others can see.  Because disability leaves a mental impact, and mental health takes a tangible form.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will lift its mask mandate for most indoor spaces starting March 14, the school announced Monday.
Strict mask requirements have been central to Harvard’s efforts to prevent the spread of Covid on its campus for the last two years. But on Monday, top University administrators signaled that the school will usher in a new phase of its approach to managing the pandemic later this month, with relaxed requirements in nearly all indoor spaces.
The announcement comes as Covid restrictions are being relaxed across the country — including in the Greater Boston area. The revisions to Harvard’s on-campus requirements on March 14 will coincide with changes to Covid policies in the city of Cambridge, which announced last month that it will lift its indoor mask mandate on the same day.
Masks will still be required at large indoor gatherings, in health care facilities, and in transit facilities. Individual professors will be able to require masks in the classroom.
Top University administrators — including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 — wrote in a Monday email to Harvard affiliates Monday that Harvard has seen few hospitalizations and no Intensive Care Unit admissions this year, despite reporting a large number of cases.
“Although public health authorities have concluded that the virus causing COVID is likely to continue to circulate among us like the cold or flu, the risks it poses for the health of our community can be managed effectively with less intrusive measures than before,” they wrote.
While case rates are declining across most of the University, cases have surged among undergraduates in recent weeks. Between Feb. 28 through March 4, 294 College students tested positive for Covid-19, accounting for more than 80 percent of Harvard’s total cases, according to the University’s Covid-19 testing dashboard.
In a follow-up email on Monday, the College announced a set of more stringent requirements for undergraduates that will take effect immediately. Non-sponsored social gatherings will be banned in indoor residential spaces until March 28. Students will also be required to test three times per week.
“We will assess case counts on March 28 to determine if we can return to our current practice and will consider several factors when easing restrictions – among them, high testing compliance rate and positivity rate that aligns with the rest of the campus,” Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an email to undergrads.
Administrators also urged undergraduates to continue wearing masks indoors, even after the University’s requirement is lifted.
Beginning March 14, all Faculty of Arts and Sciences instructions will be able to teach without a mask, regardless of class size. Masks will be optional for students in the classroom, though individual instructors will be allowed to require them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Backed by a pair of local politicians, two Harvard unions are redoubling longstanding efforts to push for a merger, which have failed three times before.
The roughly 80-member Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union and the 5,000-person Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers have long sought to merge under the umbrella of HUCTW. Now, they hope support from a pair of local elected officials — Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Boston City Councilor Elizabeth A. “Liz” Breadon — will help put pressure on the University to support the change.
The unions released statements of support from Siddiqui and Breadon last week after more than 136 members signed onto a petition calling for HUSPMGU to be included as part of HUCTW.
HUSPMGU represents Harvard security, parking, and museum guards, while HUCTW represents clerical and technical workers across campus.
HUSPMGU is currently negotiating for a new contract with the University, with HUCTW bargaining on its behalf, according to Danielle R. Boudrow, HUCTW’s recording secretary.
The unions plan to hold campaigns in Harvard Square in the coming weeks.
“These people are saying what union they want to be in, and the University ought to respect it,” Boudrow said. “HUCTW is here, ready to be completely flexible in what that looks like.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the renewed push.
The unions first tried to merge in 2016. In response to the original proposal, Harvard Director of Labor Relations Paul R. Curran raised legal questions about the plan, citing a provision in the National Labor Relations Act that does not allow “guards” and non-guards to join under one bargaining unit.
The petition — signed by more than 130 union members — said HUSPMGU members “deserve the same opportunities, benefits, and protections that all other employee groups at Harvard enjoy.”
“We strongly support the rights of HUSPMGU members to choose the union that represents them — to be included in HUCTW and covered under the HUCTW Agreement,” the statement said.
The petition called on Harvard leaders to work “constructively and expeditiously” to establish a plan that would include HUSPMGU members in HUCTW “in the very near future.”
According to Boudrow, members of HUSPMGU are the lowest paid workers at the University at $17.69 per hour.
“It will cost slightly more to have HUSPMGU in HUCTW than to have them on their own,” Boudrow said. “Their wages and their benefits are so substandard that to bring them up to an appropriate level will have a cost associated with it.”
In statements last week, Siddiqui and Breadon called on Harvard to allow the unions to merge.
“This disparity among Harvard service workers doesn’t make sense, and is clearly unfair to the dedicated members of the long-established HUSPMGU union,” wrote Breadon, who represents Allston-Brighton on the Boston City Council.
Siddiqui wrote that HUSPMGU members “have clearly and repeatedly expressed their desire to be included in HUCTW.”
“After six years of negotiation on this topic it is past time for Harvard to stop standing in their way,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just shy of two years after Covid-19 shuttered Harvard’s campus in 2020, the University announced it would lift one of its primary pandemic prevention measures — its strict indoor mask mandate.
The changes come even amid a surge in Covid cases among undergraduates. More Harvard College students tested positive for the virus last week than during any other seven-day period since the start of the pandemic.
The University announced the policy shift in a series of emails Monday morning. Here’s what you need to know about the upcoming changes.
Starting March 14, the University will no longer require face coverings to be worn in most indoor spaces.
The announcement comes as Covid-19 cases in the Greater Boston area continue to drop. Massachusetts authorities have already lifted the state’s mask mandate, and the City of Cambridge announced last week that it will end its restrictions on the same day as Harvard.
But at Harvard, undergraduate cases have surged in recent weeks. In an email announcing the changes on Monday, administrators said that despite high case rates, very few affiliates have gotten seriously sick and none have been sent to the ICU.
In the emails announcing the changes, administrators stressed that students who wish to continue masking will be able to do so.
“Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or marginalized because they choose to wear a mask,” University administrators wrote to all Harvard affiliates Monday. “They should never feel obliged to explain the reasons for their decision.”
Individual schools and classrooms may still require mask-wearing, though it will no longer be mandated by the University. The school will continue to require masks in health care settings, on public transport, and at indoor gatherings that exceed 250 people.
Instructors at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were told to inform students by March 14 if they intend to continue to mandate mask-wearing in classrooms.
Students and faculty will also be required to conduct regular testing.
Affiliates who test positive must self-isolate for five days and continue to wear a high-quality mask with others for ten days.
Booster shots are required for all affiliates.
Harvard College’s high case rate is an outlier at the University. Over the last two weeks, undergraduate students have accounted for more than 79 percent of Harvard’s total case count.
Just after the University announced the changes to its mask requirements on Monday, the College sent out its own school-specific guidelines that include some stricter measures.
College students will not be allowed to gather in any indoor residential spaces for non-sponsored social gatherings until March 28. Housing Day festivities, which were already modified due to the pandemic, will continue as planned on Thursday.
The College also bumped the undergraduate testing cadence up from twice per week to three times per week. Students will also be required to test negative before leaving campus for spring break.
The policies will be reassessed on March 28 based on case counts and testing compliance.

Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott said in a Friday interview that the full return to in-person athletics has “meant everything” for student-athletes.
After a four-season time out, Harvard Athletics resurrected last fall with a full competition schedule, including normal travel and training. McDermott said the homecoming has been marked by success and excitement for student-athletes training under Covid-19 restrictions.
“Even though it certainly continues to be challenging in ways, the full return was so palpable in the fall,” McDermott said. “I just was going around and meeting with teams and it was giving me such joy to see their joy.”
McDermott said the halt to sports inspired a renewed appreciation among student-athletes.
“They so much more appreciated the fact that they were together,” McDermott said. “They were with each other, they were with their coaches, they were training, and they were playing, and I don’t think I’ve seen people more happy to practice in my life.”
McDermott attributed the recent success of Harvard’s varsity teams even after a year without much training to this sentiment.
Many of Harvard’s teams have made their mark this year. The Women’s Basketball team is headed to the Ivy League Championship Friday, and the Women’s Ice Hockey team recently won a bid to the NCAA tournament. The Men’s Volleyball team also won the Ivy League Championship after back-to-back victories.
Although the return has been filled with joy, it has not been without hiccups. Student-athletes have reported mixed experiences with Covid-19’s impact on the athletic experience at Harvard, citing postponed competitions and difficulty in team bonding.
Amid the Omicron surge, Harvard rolled back its indoor spectator policy. McDermott called this a necessary step to preserve the overall continuity of competitions.
“That’s a big effect on the teams that were really looking forward to just having the normalcy of people at their games, and we were able to do that in the fall all throughout, so to then scale back in the winter felt like we were taking a step back,” McDermott said. “But it was all in the effort to preserve the ability to keep playing and move forward.”
McDermott said she was grateful that athletics has been able to avoid a complete halt so far, thanks to safety measures in place. Some measures include regular testing, grab-and-go dining during travel for competitions, and a mask mandate in athletic facilities for those not actively training.
“When we started this year, we really had this main priority and goal of maintaining protocols in a way that would preserve, at least as much as we could, the opportunities to compete,” she said. “I’m very grateful that that’s been the case — we haven’t stopped altogether.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council discussed funding applications from religious groups, an initiative to provide free menstrual products across the University, and three constitutional amendments at their biweekly meeting Monday.
Members from nine of Harvard’s 12 graduate and professional schools attended the meeting, held at the Harvard Kennedy School, either in person or through Zoom.
Parisa L. Hamm kicked off the meeting by providing an update on her proposal to provide free menstrual products across the University. Hamm said she aims to have the proposal — which the Council of Deans heard Friday — implemented by fall 2023.
The Council also considered two applications to the One Harvard Catalyst Fund, which offers funds to organizations for events that promote interaction among Harvard schools.
The HGC approved the Harvard Business School Islamic Society's request for funding of a Ramadan celebration, with seven representatives voting in favor of the proposal. The Council also voted to reopen consideration of funding for the Christian Fellowship, another HBS organization.
The Council also opened two amendments to its constitution and one amendment to its bylaws for notice and comment, a two-week period in which members can suggest revisions to the amendments.
The first amendment, proposed in response to members’ requests for additional HGC representatives in order to distribute the workload, would set a minimum of two representatives per school and a maximum of four, depending on the school’s enrollment.
The second amendment offers a restructuring of the Council’s executive board, with new positions related to programming and advocacy.
The suggested amendment to the bylaws would set the minimum meeting frequency to biweekly, allowing additional meetings to be scheduled at the discretion of the Executive Board.
Chair of Governance Carlos A. Gonzalez Sierra, a Harvard Law School student, explained the value of amending the meeting pattern.
“I think some of the benefits of more frequent meetings, whenever they start, is community building, but also [to] help HGC become more effective at carrying out initiatives,” he said. “That's the spirit behind the proposed amendment.”
The Council also discussed actions they could take in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such as serving as a “catch-all” organization for various student-led movements or researching the University’s ties to Russia.
Community Engagement Chair Landon A. Fortenberry provided an update on the Harvard Votes Challenge, which he said is scheduled to launch “as soon as possible”.
“Our initiative could not be more timely — this year, Massachusetts will elect a new governor, state reps, and senators, along with the federal representatives,” Fortenberry said.
Other developments covered at the meeting included an upcoming meeting with Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen, plans for a women’s leadership conference, and a strategy book compiled by Council President Peter M. S. Choi that will serve as an “instruction booklet” for members to consult when starting projects.
The meeting concluded with an optional tour of the Kennedy School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following guidance from a student divestment group at Harvard, activists from five peer universities filed legal complaints last month in an effort to push their schools to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
Students at MIT, Princeton, Yale, Stanford University, and Vanderbilt University all filed complaints to their respective state attorneys general alleging that their institutions’ fossil fuel investments are illegal.
The complaints, which were supported by the nonprofit Climate Defense Project, followed a similar approach taken by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard last year. In March 2021, FFDH filed a legal complaint to Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 that claimed Harvard violated the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, which stipulates that nonprofits must invest with their charitable purposes in mind.
In their complaints, the student activists at the five colleges argued that their respective schools’ investments in the fossil fuel industry also violated the law.
Lawrence Z. Tang — a member of Yale’s Endowment Justice Coalition — said that, under UPMIFA, Yale has to “work for the advancement of humanity.”
“We think that their continued investment and funding of the fossil fuel industry is against that agenda,” he said.
A Yale spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Harvard student organizers said they provided advice to their peer activists.
FFDH organizer Klara A. Kuemmerle ’24 said there has been “a lot of both inspiration and direct one-on-one working,” adding that the barriers to filing a legal complaint are “lowered” for other schools because FFDH had already gone through the process.
“We’re very supportive of other schools because if this is the way that we will get other schools to respond, then that’s amazing,” Kuemmerle said. “We are grateful that, if anything, Harvard and other institutions might listen to the legal argument for why divesting is not only necessary for our futures, but also for them as an institution and what they stand for.”
MIT Divest’s outreach coordinator, Ellie S. Rabenold, said Harvard organizers “prepared a very impressive guide detailing all the steps in preparing a legal complaint.”
Like Harvard, the groups at other schools worked with the Climate Defense Project to file their complaints.
“We think this strategy is valuable because it reminds institutional investors that they have a legal obligation not to undermine their institutions’ missions and values,” the organization’s co-founder, Joseph E. “Ted” Hamilton, wrote in an email. “Ideally, universities will divest of their own volition in light of these fiduciary obligations.”
FFDH organizer Suhaas M. Bhat ’23-’24 said the recent efforts by activists at other schools have been “really heartening.”
“This complaint strategy spread is incredible,” he said. “It seems to me — and it seems to us — to be an incredibly viable strategy for divestment.”
Harvard announced last September that it will move to divest its endowment from fossil fuels by letting its remaining investments in the industry expire. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a September interview that the complaint filed by FFDH organizers did not play a role in the school’s decision to let its fossil fuel investments wind down.
Still, Harvard’s move provided hope to activists from peer schools.
“For MIT Divest, we really hammered home that Harvard and Boston University had publicly announced divestment, and specifically Harvard because it is so close,” Rabenold said.
MIT’s divestment group organized a three day sit-in in front of the university president’s office after the group filed its legal complaint last month.
MIT spokesperson Kimberly Allen pointed to the school’s climate action plans, as well as its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in its investment portfolio by 2050 — a pledge Harvard has also made.
“People look to our institution as a bastion of learning and technology and future progress,” Rabenold said. “It’s shameful that MIT continues to invest in the very companies that are leading to our planet’s ruin.”
Still, none of the peer institutions have subsequently pledged to wind down fossil fuel investments following the complaints.
“We are disappointed,” Tang said, “but obviously not that surprised.”

With the retirement of one of its justices on the horizon, the Supreme Court is preparing to hear a case that could decide the future of affirmative action in higher education.
The Supreme Court agreed in January to take up a pair of lawsuits brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The suits allege that the schools discriminate against Asian American applications through their race-conscious admissions practices and ask the court to overturn precedent endorsing affirmative action in the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger.
The suits will mark the first time the court will consider an affirmative action case since the addition of Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett expanded the court to its 6-3 conservative majority.
To understand where the court may stand on the issue, The Crimson profiled each of the eight justices who will remain next term, as well as President Joe Biden’s nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92. The profiles examine their prior rulings, amicus curiae briefs, and other legal documents.
Since ascending to the court in 2005, Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 has ruled four times on the use of race in either high school or college admissions, each time making clear his opposition to affirmative action.
Two years into his tenure on the Supreme Court, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a case shooting down the practices of a Seattle high school, which set racial quotas in its admission process. He acknowledged the value in “remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination” but asserted that “the way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”
In the 2014 case Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of an amendment to the Michigan state constitution that barred affirmative action in public institutions.
In a concurring opinion, Roberts wrote that “racial preferences may themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely that doubt, and—if so—that the preferences do more harm than good.”
A year earlier in the case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, Abigail N. Fisher sued the University of Texas at Austin for its use of race in admissions. Roberts joined a seven-justice majority in ruling that race cannot be considered unless the school’s admissions practices are “narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”
When Fisher returned to the court two years later in 2015, Roberts disagreed with the majority opinion, which upheld the university’s consideration of race in admissions.
The most senior justice on the Court, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas has ruled on the use of race in college admissions seven times since his tenure began in 1991.
When Grutter v. Bollinger reached the Supreme Court in 2003, Thomas dissented from the court’s opinion, which declared the affirmative action policies utilized by the University of Michigan’s law school constitutional.
In Gratz v. Bollinger, a similar case concerning the University of Michigan’s undergraduate admissions, Thomas joined the majority opinion striking down the school’s point-based practices, which automatically awarded extra points to students from racial minorities.
“I would hold that a State’s use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause,” Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion.
He reiterated his disapproval of affirmative action in higher education in several subsequent cases, including Schuette and both Fisher lawsuits against the University of Texas.
“As should be obvious, there is nothing ‘pressing’ or ‘necessary’ about obtaining whatever educational benefits may flow from racial diversity,” Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion in the first Fisher case.
Associate Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. previously upheld race-conscious admissions in the 2007 Seattle high school admissions case and defended the rights of Michigan voters to alter their state constitution to ban the use of race or sex-based preferential treatment in university admissions.
In the first Fisher case, Alito joined the majority opinion in ruling that schools may implement affirmative action practices in their admissions so long as they meet strict scrutiny standards. When the court examined the University of Texas’s admissions in the second Fisher lawsuit, he was one of the three justices to rule in favor of the plaintiff.
“When UT decided to adopt its race-conscious plan, it had every reason to know that its plan would have to satisfy strict scrutiny and that this meant that it would be its burden to show that the plan was narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests,” Alito wrote in a dissent. “UT has failed to make that showing.”
President Barack Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee ascended to the high court in 2009 and has since ruled in Schuette and both Fisher cases. A staunch defender of the constitutionality of affirmative action, Sotomayor was part of the seven-justice majority that ruled in favor of the University of Texas in 2013.
“[R]ace-sensitive admissions policies further a compelling state interest in achieving a diverse student body precisely because they increase minority enrollment, which necessarily benefits minority groups,” Sotomayor wrote in a dissent to the court’s Schuette ruling.
When the second Fisher reached the Supreme Court, Sotomayor was part of the majority that voted to preserve the use of race in college admissions.
Since her tenure on the court began in 2010, Associate Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself from all three of the affirmative action cases that have reached the Supreme Court, including from both Fisher cases due to her previous involvement in their litigation when she served as United States Solicitor General from 2009-2010.
But prior to joining the court, Kagan defended race-conscious admissions practices.
As solicitor general, Kagan approved the filing of an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Department of Justice in 2010 that supported the University of Texas’ affirmative action policies. The brief argued that the school showed sufficiently compelling interest in cultivating a diverse student body.
Decades earlier, while serving as a policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, Kagan and her co-author Bruce Reed wrote in a memo to the president that there is “still a need for narrowly tailored affirmative action programs, and certain other kinds of targeted initiatives.”
While Associate Justice Neil M. Gorsuch has said little on affirmative action directly, he has displayed a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Penning the majority opinion in the case ​​Bostock v. Clayton County, Gorsuch wrote that “only the words on the page constitute the law adopted by Congress and approved by the President.”
Harvard Law Professor Jeannie C. Suk Gersen wrote in a 2020 New Yorker article that Gorsuch’s apparent textualist viewpoint does not bode well for the future of affirmative action.
But as Gorsuch has yet to weigh in on an affirmative action case, his perspective on the issue remains unclear.
Appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, Kavanaugh has also not yet ruled on affirmative action. His lack of rulings on the matter, however, have led legal experts to speculate about how he will vote in the Harvard admissions case.
When Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger reached the Supreme Court in 2003, Kavanaugh – serving as associate counsel – coordinated the White House’s opposition to the University of Michigan’s use of affirmative action, per the request of then-President George W. Bush.
During Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, the media reported on a newspaper column he wrote for the Wall Street Journal in 1999. In the column, he predicted that the Supreme Court would one day rule that “in the eyes of the government, we are just one race.”
Appointed in late 2020, Barrett has also not ruled on affirmative action throughout her career. Experts have attempted to draw clues on her stance from her general judicial philosophy.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law, told The Crimson in late 2020 that he thinks Barrett’s originalist views clash with affirmative action precedent.
“If she's a true originalist, she's going to have to contend with the fact that the level of scrutiny that American higher education now experiences in the hands of the federal government is anything but original to the U.S. Constitution,” Lake said.
When the Supreme Court agreed to hear Students for Fair Admissions’ lawsuit in January, Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz said that Barrett may cast the deciding vote.
Nominated last month to replace outgoing justice Stephen G. Breyer, Jackson did not opine on affirmative action during her tenure on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Outside of the courtroom, she has also kept her views on the issue concealed. While running for a seat on the Harvard Board of Overseers, all other candidates stated their support for Harvard’s use of affirmative action. Jackson refused to provide her stance, citing her position as a federal judge who could potentially rule on an affirmative action case.
But Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, a pro-affirmative action group of nearly 700 alumni, endorsed Jackson’s ticket for the Board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, the women’s lacrosse team clinched its first win over No. 24 University of Pennsylvania since 2000. The game also marked Harvard’s first Ivy League contest of the year.
“It feels great,” coach Devon Wills said. “Penn is a great team, so no matter how long it’s been since we’ve beat them, it just feels really great to beat a really strong team. Our team has been working so hard all week; it was a full team win.”
“This being the first Ivy game, everyone was so hyped up, so prepared, and ready to get after it,” junior midfielder Grace Hulslander said.
The Crimson (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) opened its season with a loss in its first game to Colorado on Feb. 20, followed by a win in its second game over Holy Cross on Feb. 22, before its game against Georgetown was postponed last Saturday. Harvard was fired up and ready to take down the No. 24 Pennsylvania Quakers (1-3, 0-1).
“We had a lot of time to prepare for this game and get in the winning mindset,” Hulslander said. “I think we can attribute the win to our preparation for the game and our mindset the whole time. We went into the game knowing that we were fully prepared and fully believing that we could beat Penn.”
The Crimson came out strong, with Hulslander scoring the first goal on a free possession less than two minutes into the first quarter. While the Quakers quickly responded with a goal, sophomore midfielder Callie Hem put Harvard back on top with a strong cut and fire. After a forced turnover from junior midfielder Shea Jenkins, sophomore attacker Riley Campbell scored goal number three for the Crimson. Despite a 3-0 run from Penn, Hem scored her second goal to tie the game 4-4 before the half.
In the second half, the game was tied 6-6 until Harvard pulled ahead, scoring three consecutive goals. The first was a draw and dish from Campbell to first-year attacker Caroline Mullahy. Despite dropping the ball in front of the crease, Mullahy managed to scoop it up and toss it behind her back and into the net — a highlight goal no doubt. Hulslander’s second goal followed, and then Campbell’s fourth, making the score 9-6 with three minutes to go.
The Quakers responded with two more goals and had possession with one minute left, putting pressure on the Crimson defense. Harvard managed to force a turnover, securing the ball until time expired.
“The team really battled,” Wills said. “They showed a lot of resilience. There were a lot of ups and downs throughout the game, but we showed that they can respond and make key plays when they need to.”
Campbell finished the matchup with four goals and an assist, an impressive performance for the sophomore, who pointed out it was her first away game with the team.
“It feels awesome,” Campbell exclaimed. “This is my first away trip ever for Harvard women’s lacrosse. This is my first real season, so it was my first game on the road and my first Ivy game. I feel so happy and so proud. We really pulled it out as a team today.”
The Crimson looks to carry its momentum from its historic victory into its game against Siena College back in Cambridge this Friday, March 11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two new College Squash Association (CSA) team national championships already in the trophy case, the Harvard squash program set out this weekend to give players their chances to shine at the CSA Individual Nationals.
Seniors Victor Crouin (13-1) and Samuel Scherl (15-0), and junior Marwan Tarek (14-1) returned to Philadelphia, the site of the Crimson’s team title win less than two weeks ago, in a bid for the Pool Trophy. The trio accompanied seniors Hana Moataz (12-1) and Amina Yousry (7-1), who, alongside sophomore Marina Stefanoni (12-1), were representing Harvard in the women’s draw for the Ramsay Cup.
None of Harvard’s individual representatives in either division had lost more than one match throughout the entire team season. In this tournament, though, each school sent their top performers, ensuring that the Crimson athletes’ nearly unblemished records would be challenged.
Yet Harvard was ready. Second-seeded Crouin set an early precedent, defeating his challenger from Trinity College in three well-played games. Later the same day, the Frenchman faced off against No. 7 Velavan Senthilkumar from Columbia, obtaining an identical result.
Defending champion Marwan Tarek opened play against the tournament’s eleventh seed, who hailed from Yale. Tarek executed an efficient and effective tactic against his opponent, scoring 33 points while only conceding 14 to take the match in straight games and join Crouin in the quarterfinals.
After the early victories, though, the Crimson’s lone undefeated man fell. No. 12 Scherl started his weekend off against the University of Pennsylvania’s Aly Abou El Einen. Despite putting up a good fight, losing each game by no more than three points, the veteran player was not able to join his teammates in the next round of play.
In the second stage of the tournament, Tarek faced off against one of Harvard’s regular season rivals from the University of Pennsylvania, No. 3 Andrew Douglas, who proved to be a challenging opponent. After dropping the first two games, Tarek made a late run to take the third game in a thrilling 11-9 fashion. The comeback, however, was not to be, as Douglas claimed the fourth to secure his spot in the semifinals.
And thus three became one: if the Crimson hoped to secure its fifth straight Pool Trophy, it had to be because Victor Crouin, the two-time Ivy League Player of the Year and 2018-19 Individual National Champion.
In Ramsay Cup action, all three of Moataz, Yousry, and Stefanoni emerged victorious from the initial round of sixteen, vanquishing opponents from Trinity College, the University of Virginia, and Princeton respectively. The top-seeded Moataz allowed just six points in her first match to advance to the quarterfinals.
Moataz then cruised past Cornell’s No. 7 Wen Li Lai in three straight games in the second round. No. 4 Stefanoni followed her teammate through to the national semifinals after a sweep of Yale’s No. 12 Sneha Sivakumar.
Yousry found herself early in a 2-0 game deficit to No. 3 Malak Ashraf Kamal, even after taking her into extra points in game one. Yousry seemed to apply a tactic change, commanding control of the pace of the play. After two more games, the match was tied. In the final game, though, Kamal recovered her edge. A colossal battle climaxed with Kamal barely scrounging out the final point required to take the game 11-9 and the match 3-2.
Saturday at the Specter Center proved to be just as action-packed as the previous day. The Crimson had three national semifinalists in Crouin, Moataz, and Stefanoni.
In his semifinal match-up, Crouin had a chance to avenge Tarek’s elimination as he faced off against Douglas. The Frenchman seized the opportunity and executed a convincing sweep, winning the second game 11-1 to send himself into the finals the next day.
While Stefanoni battled with No.1 Sivasangari Subramaniam from Cornell, Moataz was locked in a duel against Trinity’s Kamal. Each game, the two traded point after point, until Moataz was finally able to string together a quick set of points to edge out her opponent and take the match 3-1.
Stefanoni lost in a tight battle against Subramaniam, just missing out on an all-Harvard Ramsay Cup final.
The draw was set for Sunday: senior squash stars Crouin and Moataz each had one match left to bring the CSA individual title home to Cambridge.
Moataz found herself in an exciting final, looking to complete a comeback from two games to one down against Subramaniam. An exceptionally composed fourth game meant Moataz had tied the match at two games apiece. But in the final deciding game, Subramaniam managed to come out on top. At the end of a successful season, Moataz now adds another CSA individual runner-up accolade to her collection, a feat which she previously accomplished as a sophomore in 2019-20.
The Crimson’s last hope for an individual title, Crouin, took the court against Princeton star No.1 Youssef Ibrahim. Crouin’s sole regular season loss was in a five-game thriller against Ibrahim, but this time around the Harvard phenom hoped to flip the script. Five exhilarating games later, that’s exactly what he did.
After an exhausting first set, culminating in a 16-14 win for Crouin, the senior seemed to take the match’s momentum in hand. Ibrahim however, did not go away. The two athletes battled intensely the next two games, with the Princeton player narrowly winning both.
Down 2-1, Crouin dug deep into his bag to gather the ingredients for a comeback: stamina, force, and intentionality in his shots. Crouin dove and lunged for each play, forcing Ibrahim to follow suit to return the thunderous backhands from the Crimson athlete's racket. The spectacular play in game four and game five of the final was drowned out by the roars of the Specter Squash Center. Emerging from the aftermath of an incredible match was Crouin clutching the Pool Trophy to conclude his incredible collegiate career. In his time at Harvard, Crouin has accumulated three CSA team national titles and two individual national titles.

You can’t say Mather without talking about its singles. “I think ultimately the best part of Mather is you have single rooms. You still live in a suite on the low rise or you have your own single room,” HoCo chair Ailie S. Johnson ’24 said. Residents living in the tower have their own singles while low-rise residents live in suites that accommodate four to five people.
“It's nice because you have your own room, but you're still living with all of your friends,” Johnson noted. That’s not all: for all the hotties with stomach problems, bathrooms are either ensuite or right next to your single for rooms in the tower.
Come for the singles, stay for the vibes. Mather’s dining hall is the social hub for its residents to enjoy the natural lighting while conversing with their friends. “Our dining hall feels very much like home,” Johnson said. “We have comfortable chairs and everyone sits with each other. So those two things mixed together creates a home-like atmosphere.” Mather also boasts a strong party presence through its large Junior Common Room, which comes with a ping pong table and many, many couches.
No matter where your interests lie, Mather has you covered. Not only is Mather equipped with basic amenities like a gym, library, and junior common room, but it also has a bunch of other quirks and perks that you don’t want to miss! Mather has an extensive list of extra spaces that set it apart from the other houses. For one, prepare to get your hands dirty because Mather has its own pottery room in the basement. There are weekly classes where you can ease your mind from your stressful classes and have fun learning how to create your own clay masterpiece. But, if you’d rather reshape your mind than reshape a piece of clay, Mather also has a tranquility room where you can meditate and take yoga classes, equipped with more blankets, pillows, mats than you can count. Those who are more musically inclined will also find that Mather caters to their needs: it’s equipped with four music practice rooms where you can play your instrument to your heart’s content or sing your soul out.
When you get tired of taking advantage of all the fun activities that Mather has to offer, have no fear because you’ll be able to feast on the amazing snacks and drinks that are offered at Mather’s Happy Hours (other houses call them steins) and brain breaks! But wait… there’s more! Every so often, Mather hosts Doggy Happy Hours where you get to enjoy the company of the house’s resident dogs — Yogi, Kira, Donkey, and Cori. And speaking of animals, Mather has not ONE but TWO cool mascots: gorillas and lions (Clearly, we weren’t lying when we said concrete jungles are where dreams are made of)!
If fluffy, adorable, and loyal are not what you look for in friends, fear not because Mather holds many social events for humans throughout the year as well — Mather Lather, Mather Prom, and Fall Fest. Mather is known to be a very ~lively~ dorm so you can look forward to meeting new people even at gatherings in the courtyard. And in case you were wondering what Matherites jam out to at their many socials and parties, if you’re a Swiftie (or any person with refined taste), the Matherites we chatted with share their love for Taylor Swift.
We sat down with Mather’s HoCo chair for all the insider details about Harvard’s ~quirkiest~ house:
What is your favorite memory in Mather? 
ASJ: I think one of my favorite memories was during Fall Fest and we brought out our Fire pit and everyone was making S’mores and everyone was just happy and there was Taylor Swift playing in the background. And it was just good vibes.
Any words you want to say about Mather to the future freshmen?
ASJ: Well, I would say that even though the architecture isn't the prettiest, it has the best community and you don't have to live in a double room ever again. I feel like that alone is really nice. You have your own space, but you also have a community to go to. So you can kind of have both.
If you had to describe Mather as one HUDS dish, what dish would you describe Mather as? 
ASJ: I would describe it personally as the—this is going to be so weird—but the jalapeno mac and cheese, because it's just the best. It's seasoned, it’s great, and Mather’s just great. And so I would compare Mather to that because I love both of them with all my heart.
Do you have a favorite thing that they do for brain breaks here? 
ASJ: My favorite thing is going down to the d-hall at like 9 or 10 p.m. to get a bagel and chocolate milk. It just hits the spot really late—it's just chocolate milk in general, you know?
What Taylor Swift song do you think Mather matches best?
ASJ: You could always go for “You Belong with Me.”
What Hogwarts house do you think Mather is?
ASJ: I think Mather’s Hufflepuff, but not in a bad way, like in a good way. [...] It's not like the stereotypical Harvard house with the same infrastructure design, but it has its quirks. It's made of concrete, you know. But once you get to know it, it's really nice to be here. And I have zero complaints about being here, and I actually prefer it over a lot of other houses and how they feel when you walk inside of them.
Any other things that you would want to mention about the house?
ASJ: People here are very fun. Everyone loves Mather! It's a super nice place to be and the people, as I've said, are just really nice. Everyone, like tutors and faculty deans, are always there for you! It makes living here feel like a home instead of as if you're living away from home.

Apart from its beautiful exteriors that are featured extensively in Harvard postcards, Dunster House shines on the inside, too — through its community and community-wide events. This past year, Dunster has held some unique steins, including both an ice cream and fries tasting event. For Halloween, the House pulled a few tricks out of its sleeves to bring the community together by designating certain rooms as “Trick-or-Treat” destinations.
Some other classic Dunster events are the Goat Roast, a spring-barbeque and field-day-like event. Dylan Zhou ’23 said the Goat Roast tradition once used to feature an actual goat that was roasted in the courtyard, but fortunately, that tradition has become a bit more wholesome. Zhou said it now features an outdoor barbeque with a stuffed animal goat and “roasts–as in jokes,” delivered by the Resident Dean. Perhaps Dunster’s most quirky feature is its hand-washing station located in the dining hall itself, where residents can wash their hands. It’s decked out with scented soap and stickers that one can put on afterward to signal that their hands are squeaky clean.
From its traditional aesthetics to its tight-knit community and all the sinks in between, these elements work together to make Dunster a sought-after house every year. To the freshman hoping to win the lottery and get placed in Dunster, HoCo co-chair Leslie Arroyo ’23 said, “I want to emphasize the community. Yes, Dunster is an amazing and beautiful house, and the fact that it's been renovated and its rooms make it special — I personally really love my single. But I think what really makes Dunster amazing is the people. I have just been able to make so many friends outside of my blocking group and feel truly included within the house! I've just felt very close to everyone in the house, including our house administrators and our Resident Dean, and it's been amazing living here.”
Sophomore housing features either a hallway double or a quad with two doubles. These quads are either within Dunster itself or a short walk away in DeWolfe. (Even if you end up outside the main Dunster courtyard in DeWolfe, fear not, because you’ll end up with a quad that has a kitchen and AC!)
And the housing just keeps getting better. As a junior or senior, you’ll likely live in a hallway single or a suite with all sorts of room combinations - you can pick the perfect layout for your friend group! HoCo Co-Chair Miyu Imai ’23 said she loves the architecture of the spaces that Dunster offers. “Since I spent a year and a half away from campus, this is my first time living in Dunster. The moment I stepped in here last fall I really loved it.”
What is your favorite place in the house?
LA: I really enjoy [having] the library. There are times when I might have a big assignment coming up, or something I really need to concentrate on, and I enjoy being in the library and being able to study there for a few hours. But besides that, I think the basement is one of my to-go places. A lot of times I find myself coming down here just to study with friends and sometimes even play ping-pong or foosball.
MI: I love the dining hall! It is the best dining hall ever. It's beautiful. It's spacious. It has really high ceilings and is really pretty, but also it's a place where the community comes together. It's also a place where I can study. I love how there are a lot of people coming in and it's a place where you see friends, but you can also focus and study. And you can also grab food if you're hungry. For me, the dining hall is my go-to place.
What do you think is the biggest misconception about the house?
LA: I feel like I've heard a lot of people say that it's just as far as the quad houses. I will admit it is a little far, but I think I love that we are still part of the river and that we're still close to Harvard Square. So if I want to stop by a restaurant or CVS we're still somewhat close. I think the walk is enjoyable in the sense that you are still connected to the rest of the houses here. You're still able to walk through Harvard Square, so I personally don't think it's too far. I enjoy every walk that I take.
MI: Just walking by the river is an amazing walk on its own. I’ve never found the walk to something like Smith to be too much just because it's so beautiful around here.
If Dunster was a HUDS dish, which one would it be? 
MI: Clam Chowder. I love clam chowder. I think it's like the building itself—it has that slightly traditional aspect, but once you're inside, it's beautiful. Sorry, I am a huge fan of clam chowder!

Leverett’s (Lev’s) claim to fame is that it’s the largest upperclassman house, housing more undergraduate students than any other. It’s composed of McKinlock Hall (recently renovated in 2014) and the 12-story F and G towers. HoCo co-chair Austin C. Ma ’24, a resident of the towers, says that tower rooms are impressively spacious with huge bedrooms, windows, and great views of the Charles. He shared that his “window is almost ceiling to floor!”
This is true for both singles and suites in Leverett House; gigantic common rooms are great for hosting parties, meanwhile single bedrooms can each be described as the size of “two Canaday rooms” (I’m sure that means something to some of you freshmen). HoCo co-chair Audrey H. Kang ’24—who lives in the recently renovated McKinlock Hall—assures us that Lev’s rooms and facilities are in great condition and are very clean.
Lev’s HoCo takes full advantage of the house’s many available spaces. With a beautiful courtyard, Leverites have tons of fun making their own apple cider during the house’s cider-making event. The Rabbit Hole is a popular common space where students can procrastinate their p-sets by spending hours at the pool table or performing culinary experiments in the kitchen. For performing artists, the Library Theater is home to Lev's stage, meanwhile musicians can practice their piano skills at the many—and regularly tuned—pianos stationed around the House. And if you don't feel like making the trek to Widener or Lamont, hole yourself up in the House’s personal library to get some work done, conveniently located in its courtyard.
If you're an anxious freshman worrying about being labeled a Lev bunny for the next three years don’t. It’s true: Harvard’s largest house boasts a bunny—or hare—as its mascot with it’s green and yellow flag proudly displaying three bunnies on its shield. And it’s not a coincidence. Fun fact: subtracting one ‘t” from Leverett to make it “Leveret” will actually give you the term for a baby hare. If you’re a prospective humanities concentrator who appreciates a good pun, then maybe this will make you manifest getting Lev a little extra.
If walls could speak, McKinlock’s walls would be able to recite some of the wisdom that earned Amanda Gorman her spot at Biden’s inauguration. And if you’re a certified gym bro, find motivation in the Jeremy Lin photo staring down at you inside the Lev gym, daring you to quit your set halfway through. Add John Roberts—the nation’s current Chief Supreme Court Justice—, Pete Buttigeg, and Cornel West and you really can’t top this mix of notable house alumni.
Lev HoCo chairs are already hard at work. Kang shares that regardless of whether future semesters permit in-person or virtual events, HoCo remains committed to creating recreational and bonding events for the Lev community, promising to “try to make it as fun as possible”. If Harvard’s sorting hat grants you Lev, freshmen can look forward to weekly steins — with themes like Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, Jefes vs. Felipes — in addition to seasonal events like ice skating and Spring formal, and an annual finals week tradition known as “Donut Dash”, where caffeine-dependent students can enjoy free donuts while trying to de-stress among fellow House residents. Ma notes the creativity of past steins and mentions a delicious Oreo tasting event: “[the past HoCo chairs] went and bought like 16 flavors of Oreos. It was great.”
How would you guys describe your House’s community or spirit?
AK: A lot of people show up to steins and events, which is really fun. I think that one of the best things about upcoming Housing Day is that Austin and I are seeing how much people want to get involved! We’ll send out emails like “who wants to get involved with the Housing Day video and merch?”, and we'll get so many replies from people saying they are interested. I think having such a large house is great, because when the opportunity arises, there are all these people who are interested in taking part — there's always something for everyone.
ACM: We're a very friendly house. Being a large house, you’ll always run into someone just randomly walking around in the d-hall or something like that. But everyone's always so friendly. And this also includes all of our tutors and all of our dining hall staff. It's just a very, very friendly space, and… good vibes!
What is something freshmen can look forward to?
AK: I think they can look forward to getting involved. I think that if there's something freshmen want, they can just literally join HoCo and they can very easily get their voice heard. I would say that's the best thing about Lev. Something I noticed when I first came in as a sophomore was how much influence you can have over events, even as someone who is new to the house. I think that's what stood out a lot, especially post-pandemic. I think freshmen, if you want something from Lev, Lev can probably give you it. You just need to speak up about it and it'll happen.
What do you think makes Lev special?
AK: If there's something you want, you have more freedom to do it in Leverett than you do anywhere else. Austin and I are open to all ideas and we have the spatial and financial capabilities to do literally anything that students want to do! If you're looking for a house that you can really make your own, I think Leverett is a really good choice.
Kang leaves us with this: “No one has ever complained about living in Leverett."
