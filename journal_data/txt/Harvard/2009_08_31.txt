After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to picture the Senate without Ted Kennedy. Over the last 47 years, his name has become synonymous with the liberal movement, and his face, with his thick white hair and ruddy cheeks, his sharp jaw and sharper tongue, has become a symbol of the American Left. Though born into uncommon privilege, Kennedy made a career of defending the downtrodden. President Barack H. Obama praised his voice as one that spoke for the “poor and powerless,” and his funeral Mass this weekend was attended not only by political bigwigs and members of the Kennedy clan, but also by 50,000 supporters from all walks of life. Senator Edward Moore “Ted” Kennedy’s life-long commitment to public service has made his career a triumph and his death a time of sadness for Massachusetts and for the nation.
Kennedy’s Senate tenure, the third-longest in U.S. history, has been definitively liberal, but Kennedy also developed a reputation for making compromises to pass landmark, bipartisan legislation. For years, Kennedy was ahead of the curve on pressing political issues, and many of his great legislative causes—such as immigration reform or health care reform—continue to be relevant today.
Kennedy’s death comes after a half-century in public service. Kennedy first gained national exposure for managing his brother John F. Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign in the western states. He later won a special election to take his brother’s former Massachusetts Senate seat in 1962 when he turned the minimum age of 30. Great Society reforms occupied much of the young Senator’s agenda. Kennedy helped pass the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended the quota system favoring Europeans and opened the doors to immigration for millions of Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans.
As a Democratic leader under Reagan, Kennedy helped pass sanctions against apartheid South Africa as an override to Reagan’s veto, and clashed openly with Reagan over weapons development and support for the Contras. Kennedy also grew to be a staunch supporter of gay and women’s rights, and his opposition to Reagan’s Supreme Court candidate Robert Bork, a constitutional originalist who hoped to overturn Roe v. Wade, is credited with preventing Bork’s nomination. On the Senate floor, Kennedy furiously alleged that “Bork’s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’ doors in midnight raids, and schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of Americans.”
Kennedy’s voting record also shows general support for limiting executive power, smoking prevention, and alternative energy, though he was accused of NIMBY-ism in his opposition to Cape Wind, a proposal for an offshore wind farm near Cape Cod. In the last decade, Kennedy has pushed for accountability and greater humanitarian aid in Iraq.
But Kennedy was hardly just a liberal bomb thrower. He reached across the aisle to secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which helped protect women against sexual harassment in the workplace. More recently, Kennedy partnered with President George W. Bush and other conservatives to pass the landmark No Child Left Behind reform to education.In his final year in the Senate, Kennedy aimed to broker a compromise on health care reform, something he called the cause of his life. His death dims the hope for a breakthrough on healthcare this year, although Kennedy’s brain cancer had kept him out of the fray for months. 
Kennedy was not always the beacon of courage and determination his eulogizers have made him out to be. As a freshman at Harvard, he worried his grades would jeopardize his eligibility to play football, so he had a friend take a Spanish exam in his place. Both were thrown out for two years but returned on good behavior, and Kennedy graduated in 1956.
Five years into his Senate career, Kennedy had another, greater brush with disaster. At just 37 years old, but on the cusp of a potential Democratic presidential nomination, Kennedy visited Martha’s Vineyard in July, 1969. He attended a party thrown for Robert Kennedy’s former staffers. The guests had been drinking moderately, but Ted Kennedy, hoping to catch the last ferry home, left the party with Mary Jo Kopechne, a young aide to Robert Kennedy.
The pair never reached the ferry. Kennedy accidentally drove the Oldsmobile off a bridge into a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island, and while Kennedy survived, Kopechne’s body was found by authorities the next day. Rumors swirled around the incident. Kennedy later pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a two-month suspended sentence, but his presidential aspirations were over.
But while Kennedy’s personal life was not perfect, we are grateful as a nation that he retained his Senate seat and went on to contribute greatly to his country. In a summer when personal transgressions of politicians have dominated the headlines, his story suggests that for many, second chances are warranted.
Kennedy’s death has been called an “end of an era” by many commentators. It’s true that as the last surviving brother of a remarkable family, his passing has pushed many Americans to sadly remember the long-gone days of touch football on the White House lawn or the youthful idealism that helped put a man on the moon. But the influence of the Kennedy brothers on Washington continues to be felt, and their brand of politics, focusing on hope for a better world and a strong commitment to public service and bipartisanship, has inspired modern-day politicians, including Obama. 
Kennedy’s leadership qualities and ability to garner support from other politicians, even those who disagreed with him, was exemplary. However, the next generation of public servants need not have a famous last name to be equally effective. We hope that present and future legislative leaders study Kennedy’s successes and step up to fill the void he left behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s freshmen are the most racially and economically diverse first-year students ever. One-fifth are Asian, one-tenth Hispanic, another tenth black. Two-thirds receive financial aid. To highlight this variety, the Freshman Dean’s Office tomorrow will hold “Community Conversations”—discussions in which freshmen will “situate [themselves] within this diversity.”
This is superficial diversity. If freshmen resemble their elders—four-fifths of whom voted for President Barack H. Obama—most lean left. Diverse backgrounds do not necessarily mean diverse perspectives. Unfortunately, the readings the FDO has assigned—specifically those by Beverly Tatum, president of Spelman College, Frank Wu, a professor at Howard University, and Felice Yeskel, co-founder of Class Action—reinforce this misconception. The authors offer different experiences but identical conclusions: Groups define individuals. 
Tatum, for instance, praises a white man for recognizing the “inescapability of his privilege” over blacks. When her son asks her how they—middle-class African-Americans—are underprivileged compared to working-class whites, she tells him, “‘as a young black male, you are underrepresented, and that is a different kind of disadvantage.’” Her assumption that blacks’ representation must match their percentage of the population strips individuals of the ability to make their own choices.
For example, though blacks are 13 percent of the national population, they are less than one percent of Montana’s population. They can move there if they wish. But “to ‘level the playing field,’ should we bus blacks into the state?” asked Walter Williams, a professor of economics at George Mason University. “I damn sure don’t want to go to Montana.”
Wu commits a similar error. He condemns comparing Asians, who earn higher incomes than whites, to blacks, who earn lower incomes, because “Asian Americans and African Americans have different group histories.” But later, he concludes, “[I]t is foolish to believe all Asian Americans are anything—except perhaps individuals.”
His essay is a lesson in cognitive dissonance. “He quickly comes to the defense of affirmative action, which is based on group preferences,” said Ward Connerly, former regent of the University of California. “Why then does he discount this classification when talking about Asians?”
Because it hurts the case for discrimination. Japanese-Americans, who lived in internment camps in the 1940s, earned as much as whites by 1959; their experience suggests that discrimination is less of a barrier, that race is less of a determinant of individual well being, and that political power is less of an antidote to societal ills than is frequently thought.
Instead, culture may be more of a determinant than race. Williams explained: “If you look at West Indian Americans, they are slightly more represented among professionals than Americans in general—yet they were enslaved. Does a racist employer care whether an African-American’s ancestors came from the West Indies?”
Culture also may be more important than class. In her essay, Yeskel warns, “Economic class is much less fluid than most people think.” She notes, “The richest one percent of the population now have more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.” But she assumes that people stay in these statistical groupings for life. In fact, individuals move. A study by the University of Michigan found that only five percent of families in the bottom quintile in 1975 were still there in 1991.
Discrimination is tough to overcome and poverty is hard to escape, but race and class are not the determinants of individual well being the authors portray them to be. Freshmen should not presume that because their peers look different, they think differently too. Diversity—the intellectual kind—is a rarity. And students should strive for it tomorrow by questioning the authors’ assumptions. Otherwise, the only thing they will situate themselves in is intellectual complacency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the greatest privileges in my life has been the chance to meet with Senator Edward M. Kennedy. My few conversations with him during my time at Harvard focused mostly on civic education, and showcased the kindness and caring which has been so eloquently eulogized during the past week. His willingness to discuss policy issues with me—an undergraduate—left me in awe of his deep desire not only to do good himself, but to serve as an example and guide for others looking to do the same. As someone who believes strongly in public service, I am inspired by Kennedy’s heroic example.
My story is not unique. Over the past days, tributes have explored not only his legislative achievements, but also the many people he helped on a personal level. We have heard stories of families with all sorts of challenges, illness to unemployment to immigration, who received help from the tireless work of Senator Kennedy. Watching the local news in Boston, I have been overwhelmed by the long parade of citizens who have come forward to tell stories of their personal experiences of our senator’s generosity.  
Kennedy’s decades of legislative accomplishments were an extension of this deep sense of empathy. Individual kindness and charity, even in the great abundance Kennedy offered, can never help all those in need. This requires action on a larger scale, the types of efforts to reach millions of Americans that can only be achieved through legislation. Kennedy’s vision of government as a force for doing together the good that we cannot do alone—the essence of his liberalism—stemmed directly from his compassion for every individual. Through government, we can pursue justice in all its forms and help those who are disadvantaged. There was an inexorable link between Senator Kennedy’s personal caring and the many legislative accomplishments for which he will be forever remembered as a great liberal. 
Under this framework, we can more fully understand his legislative record. Many have quoted Kennedy’s famous proclamation at the 1980 Democratic National Convention: “The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.” But fewer have explored the decidedly liberal content of that dream. Kennedy’s speech was delivered following an unsuccessful primary challenge against a sitting president of his own party who, Kennedy argued, was failing to live up to Democratic ideals. The speech was a call to action for liberals, and its core themes of helping those in need through civil rights, universal healthcare, and a renewed “commitment of the Democratic Party to economic justice,” remained his core beliefs nearly three decades later. 
In recent days, there has been much discussion of Kennedy’s bipartisan friendships and ability to work across the aisle. Yet in this celebration of bipartisanship we should not forget that Kennedy’s bipartisanship always served his liberal values and fulfilled his mission of helping those most in need. In the 1990s, he twice worked closely with Republican senators to pass major health care reforms, first with Nancy Kassenbaum to ensure the portability of health care for workers changing jobs, then with Orrin Hatch to pass the groundbreaking State Children’s Health Insurance Program. 
Bipartisanship did not mean capitulating to median views or special interests, but using the power of persuasion to bring along legislators from both parties behind his core principles—in this case, expanding health coverage for those in need. This pragmatism and legislative craftsmanship, coupled with his liberal convictions, made Kennedy unique in the Senate. His decades of public service were always purpose-driven, as he advocated on behalf of those most in need of health care, education, housing, and the basic elements of human dignity. To highlight this liberalism is not to politicize his legacy, but to pay tribute to his ideals. 
For young people who share Kennedy’s vision, his life can teach us that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, history’s long arc indeed bends toward justice. For Democrats moving forward with an ambitious agenda for reforming healthcare, energy, and education policy (to name only a few), Kennedy’s moral voice should continue to resonate. Arguments based on the nuances of legislative language and cost-benefit analysis are indispensable to sound public policy, but should never drown out debate over the broader moral imperatives that Kennedy understood and articulated so well. 
At a special convocation honoring him at Harvard last December, Kennedy looked back on his career, noting that Harvard instilled in him a love of public service. “I hope that in all the time since then,” Kennedy said, “I have lived up to the chance that Harvard gave me.” He understood that with any privilege comes an obligation to help those less privileged. Regardless of the many paths we will each pursue, we should all strive to emulate Kennedy’s sense of public duty and obligation to serve the world’s least fortunate.  
In Kennedy’s own words, his purpose in politics has been “to speak for those who have no voice, to remember those who are forgotten.” As America prepares for a difficult future without his passionate voice, always advocating for the down-trodden, may the leaders of today and tomorrow always heed his call.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Baseball has remained the great American pastime long after it was passed in popularity on TV and in backyards because of its uncanny tendency to mirror society. This was reaffirmed by this summer’s uproar over revelations that “Ortiz, David” was one of the names on “The List.”
The mourning for the loss of Ortiz’ innocence seemed to once again mirror the national zeitgeist. Big Papi is, of course, just the latest member of the All-Asterisk team, but because he was seen as the heart and soul of the Red Sox and as the Nation’s de-facto ambassador to America, his fall from grace hit Boston fans particularly hard. 
Papi’s public disrobing this summer wasn’t tragic or shocking so much as it was timely. Papi’s innocence is just the latest in a string of Emperor’s-New-Clothes-like illusions that have marked the past decade and which have been steadily, albeit sometimes painfully, revealed with varying degrees of feigned and genuine surprise.
Too young to care about baseball before the strike in 1994, my earliest memories come from the record-breaking power surge of the late ’90s. Like every fan my age and older, I remember the summer of 1998 for the moments spent scurrying to the nearest TV whenever Sosa or McGwire threatened the records of Ruth and Maris. That summer’s hardball fireworks happened to coincide with a brief hiccup that served as nothing more than a semicolon in a decade-long, run-on sentence of previously unimaginable financial growth. As I was 10 years old, it would be a stretch to claim that I was aware of the market’s rise that summer (whatever interest I could afford to the news was gobbled up by the much more interesting Monica Lewinsky). But with hindsight, the boom of the 1990s seem perfectly captured by that record-shattering season.
Today, McGwire and Sosa are personae non gratae in Cooperstown, and 1998 stands as a glaring reminder of what now appears so obvious: that the good times of the late ’90s were built on something other than Big Mac’s hard-scrabble midwestern work ethic or the Caribbean, Garcia-Marquez-esque, mythical mastery of Slammin’ Sammy. Rather, they were fueled by a toxic cocktail of steroids and willful ignorance.
Likening steroids and other performance enhancing drugs to the exotic derivatives and over-leveraging of the 1990s and 2000s may be a too convenient conceit. Nevertheless, there are startling similarities that once again reaffirm baseball’s unique position in American society as a pitch-perfect mimic of the economic and political climate.
The Roaring Twenties had its “live-ball” era, with oversized sluggers like Ruth and Gehrig hitting home runs at previously unimaginable rates as the country experienced the climax of its first Gilded Age. The 1940s saw Americans invest in “total war,” which came to include even baseball’s brightest stars, including Ted Williams, who volunteered for active duty. The postwar period, as has been noted and honored with such frequency as to become perfunctory and cliché, saw the integration of baseball and with it, the opening of the door to greater integration in society. The deaths of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King, Jr. had their baseball echo in Roberto Clemente’s death in 1972, which served as an explosive punctuation mark at the close of the “60s” and ushered in the era of what-do-we-do-now malaise, stagflation, oil shocks and Nixon’s demise. Finally, the economic boom of the 1990s and early 2000s had its home-run kings, whose singular ability to hit balls farther and more frequently than any players before captured the hearts and minds of fans and, while the balls kept flying, obscured the underlying instability of the boom.
Steroids did not give McGwire, Sosa, Bonds, or any other pariahs the ability to hit major-league pitching. All but the most ardent moralists and car-radio screamers would grant that most of the now tarnished stars of baseball’s Juiced Era were skilled ballplayers even without the aid of chemical enhancement. PEDs let great athletes leverage their skills to even higher, previously unimaginable levels. They enabled marginal athletes to make massive sums of money playing a kids game. And they allowed baseball to return to the glory it had lost in the 1994 strike.
Similarly, the boom times of the late 1990s and 2000s—first the technology bubble, then the real estate bubble—were driven by over-leveraging and willful ignorance. Like PEDs of baseball’s elite, the acronyms of the financial world—CDOs, CDSs, LBOs, etc.—were not skills or products in and of themselves. Rather, like PEDs, they were once-exotic, unregulated tools that allowed really smart people to make a ton of money and marginally smart people to come along for the ride, eventually becoming common and insidiously far-reaching. And like steroids, the financial tools of the current era were almost all condoned by the relevant governing bodies. Similar, too, is the extent to which the central figures in the drama and the supposed powers-that-be profess total ignorance as the bubble bursts. Ortiz’s statement echoes the defenses put forth by financial executives and regulators hiding behind unforeseeable circumstances: “Based on the way I have lived my life, I am surprised to learn I tested positive.”
Today’s era of de-leveraging calls out for a baseball figure to serve as its diamond representative. Big Papi may not be the perfect choice. Perhaps A-Rod, with his particular blend of hubris and insecurity, his enormous paycheck, and Manhattan address more closely mirrors the era’s Wall-Street-fueled excesses.
But the public naming of Big Papi has been lamented because of the unique stature Papi had as a beloved, jovial, larger-than-life figure—a Dominican Santa Claus with a hitting prowess sui generis. For a team that serves as the “heart and soul” of a region to a degree unmatched anywhere else in the country, David Ortiz carried the mantle of “heart-and-soul” for the Red Sox with greater gusto than almost any player in the league (perhaps Pujols, Jeter, or Ichiro matches him in this metric). His oversized smile and swing thus held a special place in the hearts of baseball’s most avid fans.
So, Papi’s name on “The List” did rattle a particular sense of innocence. But Ortiz is hardly the first figure of national or regional significance to be revealed as a fraud, a cheat or an artificially enhanced Frankenstein. Like the housing and stock markets in which so many Americans invested much more than their hearts and souls, the brand of baseball that captured Americans’ attentions over the past decade has been revealed for what it was: an inflated, bizarre version of the real thing.
We’ve lost an innocence bred from willful ignorance, which blinded Americans to the steroid-fueled excesses of the Juiced Era and the debt-fueled excesses of our economies’ latest Gilded Age. If from now on we must live with slower growth, fewer home runs, and the genuine, Little Papi, so be it.

Camp Harvard just isn’t what it used to be. That famed freshman-only week of college orientation is now history. In its place this year, Opening Days for the Class of 2013, having begun last Thursday, will end ambiguously on Wednesday, trailing away with the first day of classes, after largely overlapping upperclassmen move-in. At The Crimson, we fear that this shorter, shoddier introduction to Harvard just might backfire on the administration. Freshman Dean’s Office—beware. 
During these first days in the Yard, new, fragile Harvardians need time to process and reflect on the complex information being hurled at them from all sides. With no time alone on campus before upperclassmen move in, how will bright-eyed newbies have any chance of fully contemplating the nuanced lessons of Sex Signals, for instance? 
Without the necessary downtime to grasp these profound skits, freshmen are sure to be sexually assaulting one another left and right this year. Similarly, with fewer minutes to internalize their proctor’s rules and instructions, the Yard will likely see a rash of life-threatening hot-plate fires. And don’t even be surprised this year if you catch a freshman consuming an illegal alcoholic beverage in his residence or while congregating outside his burnt-down entryway.
With so little time, and an overwhelming number of classmates to bond with, freshmen might find themselves shortening introductions to the point of absurdity. “Hi, I’m Laura. I live in Canaday. I’m from Colorado, and I plan on—.” That’s right; you newcomers might never find out what Laura’s prospective concentration is. And how do you plan to survive at Harvard without knowing that? What if she was planning on concentrating in Government too!? You could have been friends! Now what? Now you have no friends.
Even the time-honored Freshmen A Cappella Jam may be cut short this year (hey, we didn’t say every development would be negative). And we expect ice cream socials to soon become ice cube socials or just cream socials. Freshmen might actually go hungry this year or grow fatigued without this sustenance—necessary to maintaining those inhuman enthusiasm levels during the first days on campus. Opening Days just won’t be the same without those sugar-induced, grinning faces.
In light of the College’s ready willingness to chop Freshman Week into Freshman Less-Than-A-Week, we fear that many other Harvard services and traditions are next in line. Freshman Parents Weekend may become Parent Saturday. And those infamous, trendy lanyards that everyone (yes everyone) at Harvard dons around their necks? Next year they’ll be just a single, unknotted red string that you drape hopelessly over your shoulder.
While it might be true that the calendar reform we supported necessitated changes to Camp Harvard, and that six days isn’t that much shorter than a week, and that incoming freshmen probably don’t notice the difference, and that there’s probably still an overwhelming amount of ice cream, we still remain highly concerned. As the academic year begins, we shudder at the dangers lying ahead for Harvard’s poorly oriented, unlucky Class of 2013.

“Pop open your hood and trunk!” the guard barked at my family in Urdu, stopping our car at a security point as we pulled up to the gate of the five-star Pearl Continental Hotel in Lahore, Pakistan. After a thorough search, we were directed to the side doors of the hotel, where our purses passed through an airport-style X-ray machine; we ourselves were ushered through full-body scanners. Finally clearing all these checks, we at last reached the posh hotel lobby. The layers of security had done the trick—with its designer boutiques and exquisite restaurants, not a hint remained of the dangerous Pakistan that reserves a spot in the daily headlines.
With enough cash to spend on such safety measures, wealthy Pakistanis can still easily escape the fear—and reality—of what Pakistan has become. The year-old democratic government is in shambles, suicide attacks are more frequent than ever, a nationwide energy crisis and a monetary crisis make international headlines, and both the encroaching Taliban and overbearing U.S. threaten to undermine Pakistan’s sovereignty—in short, the country is a mess. But at the Pearl Continental and other Western havens across the ailing state, it seems as if nothing is wrong.
During my weeklong stay in Lahore, I was repeatedly alarmed by upper-class Pakistanis’ nonchalance and misplacement of priorities. Throughout my stay, I attended one opulent wedding (but heard about many more), replete with lavish decorations and a bejeweled bride. Such grandeur has increasingly become the norm; anything less is looked down upon. People seem to be spending millions on weddings—not out of joy, but out of a desire to one-up the last celebration they have attended.
Indeed, Pakistan’s society is a living paradox, more so now than ever. On the one hand, there is the upper class. There is no comfort that money cannot buy, including security. Chauffeured cars and security guards keep these select few at ease in all situations. At the other end of the social spectrum are those who live on the increasingly perilous streets. Approximately 24 percent of Pakistan’s population lives under the poverty line, scrounging for basic necessities in the shadow of the elite. 
The country’s energy crisis is a prime example of this societal contrast. Because of poor infrastructural planning, the government has been caught off-guard by the spike in demand for energy accompanying increased population growth. To conserve energy in the summer months, when temperatures regularly exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it has instituted load-shedding, or nationwide rolling blackouts. I was told to prepare for the worst load-shedding to date, with blackouts nearly every other hour. I heard about struggling families relying solely on candlelight to run their households. This is no way to live, but in theory, every Pakistani would bear the brunt of the government’s lack of foresight.
But that’s theory, and little goes according to plan in Pakistan. Like always, there are work-arounds—the upper class, unlike the majority of people, can afford diesel-powered personal generators. Their most pressing concern is flickering lights when the generator is activated. 
Most of these modern aristocrats are not bad people, but they live in a different Pakistan, completely removed from the lifestyle of the typical citizen. Immunity to the repercussions of government decisions has bred a seeming indifference among this class. The wealthy simply go about their lives as if nothing has changed, ignoring that it is precisely their leadership that Pakistan needs now more than ever. They should be the ones mobilizing the people and pressuring the government to take action against injustice. But they are the ones content with the status quo. 
My last day in Lahore was Aug. 14, Pakistan’s Independence Day. As midnight approached, Pakistanis, primarily of the lower and middle classes, flooded the city’s streets, jamming them with bumper-to-bumper traffic. People sat atop motorbikes and stuck their heads out of soapbox car windows, dancing and singing, drunk on patriotism. As I stared out the car window, I wondered what these people had to celebrate. Sixty-two years after Pakistan was founded, its future remains uncertain, and frankly, it is completely out of the hands of these average people.
But such small opportunities for celebration are all that most Pakistanis have. The wealthy can avoid reality by dousing it with money and praying that the tide will turn on its own. As for the rest, all they can do, from time to time, is block reality with a little hope.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On December 22, 2008, a retaining wall at a landfill that stored fly ash from a Kingston, Tennessee, coal-fired power plant ruptured. Fly ash, a toxic byproduct of the coal-burning process, is separated from emissions by smokestack scrubbers, mixed with water, and stored in landfills. Enough slurry to fill 1,700 Olympic-sized swimming pools was dumped onto nearby homes and in tributaries of the Tennessee River. The accident killed millions of fish, destroyed 300 acres of property, and badly contaminated local water sources. The Tennessee Valley Authority estimates that the spill will require a multi-year, billion-dollar cleanup effort.
Had this disaster been a nuclear accident, citizens and Congress would rightfully be up in arms. But the largest fly-ash spill in American history has marshaled little public opposition to coal. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress continue to regard “clean coal” as a potential major source of green energy. Despite significant advances in coal technology, commendable progress in reducing air pollution, and reductions in mining’s environmental impact, the Kingston spill demonstrates that coal is not yet a viable option for long-term “clean” fuel production. The accident should cause Americans to demand tighter regulation of fly-ash disposal as well as to re-examine the long-term role of coal in our energy supply.
Admittedly, there are reasonable arguments to be made in favor of the continued use of coal. It is cheap, abundant, and domestically produced. Smokestack scrubbers remove most of the pollutants in coal before they can be emitted into the atmosphere. The federal government requires mining companies to restore exhausted mines to their former natural state. Electric utilities also claim that discoveries in coal gasification (the production of synthetic natural gas from coal) and carbon sequestration will dramatically reduce resultant greenhouse- gas emissions, rendering coal an ideal fuel for a post-cap-and-trade future. 
But American coal-fired power plants produce 130 million tons of fly ash every year. Industry reuses some of it for asphalt, cement, and brick manufacture, but 57 percent of fly ash is disposed of in hundreds of landfills across the country. Astonishingly, the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate fly ash, which contains arsenic, lead, mercury, and uranium, as a hazardous material.  It recommends that coal plants store fly ash in insulation-lined landfills to prevent leakage but has no mandate to actually enforce this suggestion. 
Therefore, it is no great surprise that power generators routinely store fly ash in unsafe conditions—and not just in Kingston. A 2007 EPA report concluded that fly ash had contaminated surface and ground water at 67 sites. Last month, the Department of the Interior found that 27 percent of American freshwater fish contained unsafe levels of mercury; fly-ash pollution is a likely contributing factor. The coal industry’s failure to safely dispose of fly ash has put hundreds of American towns in harm’s way. A rapid and meaningful response from the federal government is needed to prevent future disasters.
The EPA has already taken steps in the right direction. In March, the agency’s director, Lisa Jackson, announced a plan to inspect disposal sites, order cleanups and repairs, and develop safety regulations to be announced by December. Furthermore, Representative Nick Rahall has proposed legislation that would federally mandate engineering standards for fly-ash impoundments. The TVA is now preparing to convert its coal waste disposal from slurry form to dry storage, which is much less likely to leach into soil and cause toxic spills.
This strong start must be backed up by further action. The EPA should classify fly ash as a hazardous material, just as mercury, battery acid, and PCBs are. Doing so would require power generators to adhere to higher disposal standards and clean up existing dumping sites as well as increase public awareness of fly ash’s toxicity. Regulators should also ban disposal of fly ash in slurry form and require utilities to store dry fly ash in lined landfills to avoid leaching. The federal government should create financial incentives for makers of building materials to recycle more fly ash in their manufacturing processes, so that less is dumped. 
Finally, the next national energy bill should strongly discourage the building of new coal-fired power plants, even those that include carbon capture and sequestration. Until all fly ash is recycled and/or safely disposed of, the danger of polluted groundwater and sludge spills will still loom large. New coal plants will only serve to exacerbate a serious and unsolved problem. Besides, solar, wind, and nuclear energy do not emit greenhouse gases, as coal currently does. 
Thirty years ago, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident spurred Congress and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to make nuclear power plants safer. Similarly, the Kingston spill has revealed a need for government action and greater responsibility from coal-burning utilities. The coal industry must be pressured by the public and elected officials into becoming as “clean” as it can be.  Despite what the industry may publicly proclaim, there is no such thing as clean coal, at least not yet. Nobody knows this better than the people of Kingston, Tennessee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a long, hot summer. The country’s greatest period of change
since the Reagan administration has begun with violent, agitated
overtones. But the violence doesn’t awe me. Politics has been violent—or
at least violently crude and crass—for all of my generation’s time.
Although there’s special irony about an AR-15 at a healthcare debate, it’s not altogether unexpected. More
startling is the misguided attempt to move past the violence and push
for a bipartisan health-care bill: the misdeeds and misfires of the
so-called “Gang of Six.” Although an effort at bipartisanship is both
necessary and appropriate, the Gang of Six is less likely to craft
consensus than hamstring effective reform.
Most of the struggle now revolves around a slim set of
decisions and a slim set of senators. All eyes rest on three
Republicans and three Democrats from the Senate Financial Committee. But why is the gang the center of debate? Contrary to conventional wisdom, there’s more agreement about health-care reform
in Washington than disagreement. Four congressional committees have
already agreed on core tenets: community ratings, expansion of Medicaid
coverage, a health-care exchange, subsidies for low-income citizens,
incentive for employers, and an end to underwriting on pre-existing
conditions. Generally, more divisions have been bridged than broadened.
The hope of some is that these disinterested senators (mostly
from rural Western states) can craft a bill that is both effective and
bipartisan. But it won’t happen. The Gang of Six is the gang that
couldn’t shoot straight. The members are financially compromised, too
far to the right of public opinion, and uncommitted to civil debate. The gang has received disproportionate funds from the
health-insurance and pharmaceutical industries. Most significantly,
Democratic Senator Max Baucus has received $25 million in contributions from health-industry PACs since 1989, more than any Democrat. Republican Senator Mike Enzi has received a greater share of his campaign contributions from health- industry PACs than any other senator.  Admittedly,
insurance and pharmaceutical companies should have a place at the
table. But they shouldn’t be sitting at the head. I doubt that six
“co-opted” hired guns can follow the money trail to common ground for
the common good. Although the Gang of Six may be centrist in a relatively
conservative Senate, the gang is right of public opinion. When the
summer meetings began, Senator Baucus refused a seat to single-payer groups,
although a sizeable part of his own party preferred the option. Senator
Enzi has gunned down subsidies for the uninsured, cut required minimum
benefits packages, and weakened regulations to prevent underwriting
against the sick. Democratic Senator Kent Conrad won’t support a public option. Even if the gang does manage craft a bill, the chances of it being acceptable to the president’s base are low.  
Even worse, some of the gang continues to fan the flames of
anti-government protests between the coasts. In a Washington Post
interview, Senator Grassley said he would govern “upon the views of whichever group among his constituents yells the loudest” and engenders fear that reform will “pull the plug on grandma.” Senator Enzi has told roaring Wyoming town halls he has no plans to compromise.  
As a New Mexico native, I know most Western voters are not the
types conjured up to stymie reform. Many cowboys have a libertarian
streak, but above all they are pragmatic. They have no time for winded
speeches and empty pandering, which is mostly what they’re getting.
Grassley and Enzi do nothing to challenge the fake grassroots
spectacle, and in doing so they push away consensus. How can we move forward without the Gang of Six? From the
onset, many Democrats imagined a certain Central Texas boy twisting
arms for Medicare and Medicaid. For them this president is all hat and
no cattle. But President Obama can’t be LBJ. For one, the new sheriff in
town does not benefit from the widespread commitment to New Deal
philosophy and economic prosperity of the ’60s. Like my senator, Jeff Bingaman, I think some effort at bipartisanship is necessary to make reform more appealing. But that happy trail appears to be ending. 
Grassley and Enzi are merely committed to watering down reform.
They won’t vote for the final bill. From here on out, all the Gang of
Six has to offer is a few seeds of catastrophe planted from the inside.
If we jettison the gang talks, the Democratic Party can pull
back together. Despite all the abuse of lawyers, guns, and money, the
right wing of the Republican Party will have a rough time stopping
universal healthcare legislation. Centrist Democrats will be more
willing to follow the president’s lead if the gang fails than if it
succeeds. They can tell their interests they tried their best.
Furthermore, the price of friendly fire for centrist Democrats—being
voted out of office a la 1994—is just too high. If we push further away from the politics of distraction, a
universal health-insurance bill is likely around the bend. It will no
longer be as expansive or cheap as some wanted, but it will help
millions of folks. Above all, we should not forget the historical
moment. We’re at a turning point, and if we end the saloon-style
sideshows we can make sure a new era for the American people—and a new
era for trust in government as a force for good—arrives with a bang and
not a whimper.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, the “Lion of the Senate” and the last remaining son of the prominent Democratic political family, was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on Saturday after a funeral mass packed with political dignitaries that included a eulogy by President Barack Obama.Kennedy passed away last Tuesday night at his home in Hyannis Port, Mass. after a year-long battle with brain cancer. He was 77. More than 25,000 mourners lined up to pay their respects to the senator at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston on Thursday, and a private memorial for Kennedy was held at the Library the following evening.A Government concentrator and Winthrop House resident in his undergrad years, Kennedy was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate in 1962. He was reelected seven times, making him the second-longest serving member of the Senate at the time of his death.After a seizure in May 2008, he was diagnosed with a malignant glioma, a type of brain tumor that carries a bleak prognosis in the majority of patients. He underwent surgery and a subsequent aggressive course of cancer treatment in the months following the diagnosis.In the Senate, Kennedy developed a reputation as a leader on social policy issues, championing reforms in areas such as health care, education, and immigration, while leading multiple committees, including, most recently, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Though he was one of the dominant liberal figures in the Senate, Kennedy was also known for his efforts to reach across party lines to pass legislation. His quest for bipartisanship was instantiated by his alliance with former President George W. Bush on the “No Child Left Behind” school legislation, a copy of which hung on the wall of his office along with the pen that Bush used to sign the document. According to Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, who worked with Kennedy on welfare reform during the Clinton administration, although Kennedy entered office as part of a political dynasty, his ultimate reputation as an effective, revered legislator came from his passion for the issues he supported and his willingness to work with people on either side of the aisle to transform his ideas into legislation.“During his early career days he was a Kennedy,” Ellwood said, “but by the end he was the senator.”FINDING HIS WAYEdward Moore Kennedy was born on February 22, 1932 in Boston, Mass., the youngest of Joseph and Rose Kennedy’s nine children. Kennedy followed in the footsteps of his father and older brothers by enrolling at Harvard in the fall of 1950. At the end of his freshman year, Kennedy was suspended after he was caught having another student take his Spanish A final exam in his place. Both the student, William A. Frate ’54, and Kennedy were asked to take a year off, and Kennedy spent the next two years serving in the U.S. Army as a military policeman in Paris before re-enrolling at Harvard in the fall of 1953. Upon returning to campus, Kennedy joined the all-male final club the Owl, an association he would sever in 2006 after drawing criticism for condemning Supreme Court nominee Samuel A. Alito, Jr., for his one-time membership in a controversial club at Princeton.Kennedy had “really fond memories” of living in Winthrop C-33 as an upperclassman, according to Will C. Quinn ’10, a current Winthrop resident who met the senator while interning on Capitol Hill.“I told him that I had voted for him, and he was happy about that, but he really lit up when I mentioned that I lived in Winthrop House,” Quinn said.Kennedy was a noted right end on the football team during his college career, scoring the only Harvard touchdown in the Harvard-Yale Game his senior year. He turned down recruiting interest from the Green Bay Packers, instead opting to attend law school at the University of Virginia.It was at law school that Kennedy would meet his first wife, Joan Bennett, whom he married in 1958. The couple had three children—Kara, Edward Jr., and Patrick—before divorcing in 1982. After years of struggles with alcohol and a reputation for womanizing, Kennedy married lawyer Victoria Reggie in 1992. She would remain at the senator’s side during his later political endeavors and recent illness.Kennedy’s most notable scandal came in 1969 when he drove off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Martha’s Vineyard, an incident which resulted in the drowning death of his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. After swimming to safety, Kennedy did not call police until after Kopechne’s body was found the following day. The senator pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident, but remained in office and was reelected in 1970.A 1980 run for the presidency proved unsuccessful, particularly after the Chappaquiddick incident became a major factor in the campaign.But while he failed to win the office his older brother John F. Kennedy ’40 had once held, Edward had already carved himself a niche in the Senate, and would go on to become one of that body’s most powerful legislators. SENATOR AND FRIENDAfter his initial entrance into the race for a senate seat in 1962, Kennedy made getting to know the people of Massachusetts his priority, making up to 20 campaign stops a day, according to Milton S. Gwirtzman ’54, a former Crimson editorial chair who began working with Kennedy during his candidacy.Though he was born to a wealthy family often referred to as the closest thing to American royalty, Kennedy had a passion for helping the poor and disenfranchised, which was reflected in many of the over 300 successful bills he sponsored during his tenure in the Senate. “When it came to that topic, a fire would come in his eyes and you could see him rise in his chair and fill with passion,” said Ellwood. Kennedy developed his passion for the underprivileged during his first few years in office, and the young senator relied on a group of Harvard professors to help educate him about issues such as civil rights and health care.His civil rights victories included successfully fighting to protect the Voting Rights Act, increasing the minimum wage in the 1990s, and passing the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990—the last of which was held particularly close to his heart because of the mental disability of his older sister Rosemary.Kennedy’s senate staffers were known for being particularly hardworking and dedicated to the senator, according to Ricky M. Hanzich ’11, who spent this past summer working in Kennedy’s Health Policy Office. Working to support the ailing Senator’s efforts on health care—one of his primary causes—employees posted pictures of him around the office alongside a collection of inspiring Kennedy quotations.“I know that every single employee loved him,” Hanzich said. “To them he was more than just the senator—he was their friend.”A HARVARD LEGACYIn the years since his graduation from Harvard, Kennedy remained connected to the University. He was involved in creating the Institute of Politics, which commemorates his brother John. During his many years serving as a member of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee, Kennedy almost never missed a meeting and “would light up” when he had the chance to meet with students, said Ellwood.In December 2008, Kennedy was awarded an honorary degree by the University in a special ceremony, as he was unable to attend the June 2008 Commencement exercises due to his illness.“I hope that in all the time since then I have lived up to the chance Harvard gave me,” Kennedy said after receiving his honorary doctorate.The event marked one of the few times that Harvard has awarded an honorary degree outside of the June Commencement. Three heads of state—George Washington, Nelson Mandela, and Winston Churchill—are the only people to receive similar awards at special ceremonies.“Now I have something in common with George Washington, other than being born on February 22,” Kennedy said. “It is not being president as I had once hoped.”—Staff writer Lauren D.

Thesis writers, students working in labs, international students, and members of 19 varsity sports teams—including the men’s and women’s basketball and swimming teams—will be the primary categories of students that will be allowed to remain on campus during this upcoming January Term, according to Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer.
Students with other needs to be on campus, such as those working in the homeless shelter, will also be strongly considered during the application process.
The number of students allowed to stay on campus will not exceed 1,000, which is the amount that can be fed in Annenberg, the only dining hall that will be open during the break.  
But Ameer said she did not expect that more than 1,000 students would meet the criteria to stay on campus.
Students will receive an e-mail from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds in the next few weeks with a link to an application to stay on campus during J-Term. Any student can apply to stay over the break, and the form will be due by October 15, Ameer said.
According to an e-mail sent to students this past April by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, the application was originally scheduled to be made public in May.
Ameer said that the committee ultimately decided that it was unnecessary to put out the form in the spring and that it would be best to delay the release until the fall. 
William R. Rose ’11, one of the students on the committee, said he hoped that the form would be out as soon as possible.
“I think the more time we can give people to deal with it, the better that’s going to be,” he said.
Decisions will be made on a rolling basis, but Ameer said that students’ likelihood of approval will not increase based on when during that period they submit their application.
Applications will be reviewed by a committee made up of Ameer, representatives from the Office of Student Life, the Freshman Dean’s Office, the Athletics Department, the Facilities Maintenance Office, and three students—two members of the Undergraduate Council and one Peer Advising Fellow.
Though Harvard will not be offering any official programming during the January break, the Office of International Programs, Office of Career Services, Office of the Arts, Center for Public Interest Careers, and Philip Brooks House Association will be available to assist those not allowed to stay on campus with finding internships, travel abroad opportunities, or other activities for the break.
“Personally it is so cold here in January that I would recommend going to a
nice warm climate and getting some rest,” Ameer said.
While the house dining halls will be closed, all the houses will remain open and students will stay in their own rooms. The houses and dorms will have tutors and proctors on call, UHS and the libraries will remain open, and approved students will have swipe access for the period they are authorized to be on campus.
Ameer said she did not yet know if the shuttles will continue to run during January.    
This is the first academic year that the College faces an extended break between fall and spring semesters. Interim University President Derek Bok created the month long gap when he approved a new University calendar that moved final exams to before the winter recess.
This year, the official J-Term runs from Jan. 4 to Jan. 24, according to FAS registrar’s office Web site. Winter recess begins Dec. 22 this year.
While University-wide calendar reform was being considered, the idea of having academic programming—similar to that offered at MIT or Williams—was suggested by the calendar reform committee. After the revised calendar was adopted, ideas for programming were discussed, but with the University facing rising financial hardship last fall, it became clear that official college programming would be off the table.
After it began to seem unlikely that programming would be offered during the 2009-2010 academic year, some student groups, such as the Institute of Politics, considered developing their own programming. However, Rose said he sees little chance of groups such as this receiving approval to stay on campus this year.
“I’d still love to make that happen but I think it’s pretty unlikely at this point,” said Rose.
However groups with an expressed need to stay on campus—such as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which generally holds practices for its spring show during January—are likely to have their applications approved, Ameer said.
Rose said the committee has not had much control over who will be allowed to stay.
“The committee has had somewhat limit jurisdiction,” he said. “We have been implementing rules that have been given by higher up jurisdiction.”

After a worldwide search for a candidate to fill Harvard’s new professorship in Chinese social history, former Associate Professor Michael Szonyi was selected to assume the post on July 1, 2009.Szonyi is a social historian who, in addition to reading historical texts, seeks to challenge historical accounts by speaking with village elders, collecting documents from villagers, and observing lineage and temple rituals in order to see history from a local perspective, he said.“It takes a very different skill set than the one we usually associate with history,” Szonyi said about his method. “Together with Chinese colleagues, we are hoping to write a very different version of Chinese history than the one told by official government sources and the writings of the literati elite.” Szonyi will now be able to recruit graduate students from Asia and the United States and train them in his method of study. He said he also hopes to establish a summer program that will encourage students to travel to China to examine history in a similar way. “Szonyi helps to prepare undergraduates learn about Chinese culture first hand,” said East Asian Languages and Civilizations Professor Peter K. Bol, who teaches a course with Szonyi at the College.Szonyi is currently studying the social history of the Ming Dynasty military. He has traced local cults from the Ming Dynasty and has found that some of these cults continue to exist. Their traditions can help historians better understand the role of religion in establishing local social orders, Szonyi said.But Szonyi said his interests do not lie exclusively with the fourteenth century Ming Dynasty. He is also currently investigating Chinese social history during the Cold War. “It is unusual to move across time periods as easily as Michael does,” said Chinese Studies Professor William C. Kirby.“Quite by accident,” Szonyi became interested in the Quemoy archipelago, which was a point of conflict between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan during the Cold War. This confrontation almost led the United States to use nuclear force against China on two separate occasions. Szonyi is currently working on a book that compares villagers’ perspectives in Quemoy with villagers in mainland China who live in the area across from the islands. His most recent trip to China yielded interviews with villagers in the mainland who told stories similar to those of the villagers in Quemoy, showing that despite their different ideologies, the villagers were impacted in a similar way, he said.“I’ve just been attending a conference where several speakers mentioned the leading role of Harvard in the study of Chinese history,” Szonyi said. “It’s humbling to think that in my new position I’m expected to contribute to that tradition.”—Staff writer Ellie M.

Donhee Ham, one of Technology Review’s “2008 Young Innovators Under 35,” has been named the Gordon McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics. Ham is best known for his invention of a handheld nuclear magnetic resonance system, which may profoundly affect doctors’ ability to screen patients for ailments ranging from cancer to viruses. The single-silicon-chip device is not only smaller but less expensive than the machines that are being used today for NMR testing. Ham, who has known about the appointment since May, wrote in an e-mailed statement yesterday that his new post will allow him to conduct more adventurous research but will not lessen his commitment to his students. This fall, Ham will teach Engineering Sciences 154: Electronic Devices and Circuits, a course that received a 4.0 of 5.0 rating in the Q Guide. Ham received an instructor rating of 4.7 out of 5.0. “I have taught one undergraduate course every year for the past 7 years,” Ham wrote in his statement. “One undergraduate student, [William F. Andress ’04], who I worked with in my first year, wrote 6 major papers, and he got the Hoopes prize.” In addition to teaching this fall, Ham will also continue to research alongside graduate students, who he said are the “best and brightest.” “I work with extremely talented graduate students with tremendous intellectual virtuosity and high ideals,” he wrote. “I owe my career to them.”  Ham’s appointment is the culmination of a global search that lasted for approximately a year, according to J. Gregory Morrisett, associate dean for computer science and engineering. Morissett said that Ham’s work in areas such as circuits and biomedical devices and his extensive knowledge of both electrical engineering and physics helped propel him to the forefront of the candidate pool. “He’s the kind of guy we look for whose knowledge spans disciplines and can create the kind of inventions that the world needs,” Morissett said. —Anita B.

Most of the proposed shuttle service reductions that drew student protest last May—including cuts to late-night Quad trips—were not adopted in the 2009-2010 schedule, though weekend morning service has been eliminated.
The new schedule, which went into effect this past Sunday, does not offer its first weekend shuttle from the Quad until 12:20 p.m., a marked change from last year, when shuttles were available roughly every half hour starting at 7:50 a.m.
The more drastic proposed service cuts—announced by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on May 11 as part of a $77 million budget cut package—became a flashpoint for student criticism of the administration’s decision-making process, which many felt did not allow undergraduates sufficient input. 
Students also expressed concern that the changes—particularly those eliminating some late-night shuttle service—would endanger Quad residents by forcing them to trek home through the Cambridge Common late at night.
The last shuttle currently leaves from Boylston Gate for the Quad at 3;45 a.m. on weekdays, but the proposal would have pushed the final run two hours and 15 minutes earlier to 1:30 a.m. 
Weekend late-night shuttle service, which ends at 4:45 a.m., was not slated to be affected.
Following a series of meetings with students, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an e-mail to students on May 18, announcing that the decision to limit late-night shuttles would undergo further review.
“What I heard from many of you is that the reduction in overnight service raises safety concerns among those students who use this service,” she wrote in the e-mail.
Elizabeth A. Ross, a Currier House Master, said that she has not seen the new schedule, but that she had hoped that it would not include late-night changes.
Robert D. Longcor ’12 and Kevin G McNamara ’12, both Currier House residents, said they had not seen the new schedule either but were pleased that it did not include weekday or late-night cuts.
“I’m glad they didn’t cut the late-night,” said Longcor, who added that the cuts on Saturday morning would make attending soccer games inconvenient.
But McNamara said he did not mind the weekend morning cuts.
“Saturdays I’m usually asleep until 10 or 11 anyways,” he said.

The value of Harvard’s publicly traded equity portfolio has nearly doubled in recent months as the University reinvests—particularly in emerging markets and in Asia—after dramatically slashing stock holdings last fall amidst the global financial crisis.According to a Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure report released in August, Harvard had 112 publicly traded equity holdings valued at over $1.4 billion as of June 30. The figures represent a significant increase from the 99 holdings worth $771 million reported three months earlier. The SEC’s 13F report only discloses a small fraction of the University’s total investments—it does not list assets such as foreign stocks, private equity, bonds, and real assets—but suggests that in rebounding from recent market turmoil, Harvard Management Company has been boosting its investments in foreign markets by increasing shares in private companies and exchange-traded funds, which are traded like stocks and track major indices such as the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. HMC is responsible for overseeing Harvard’s endowment, which was valued at nearly $37 billion before the market crash last fall. University officials have planned for a 30 percent drop in the endowment’s value for the year ending June 30. Definitive endowment returns for that period are expected to be released in the next few weeks.In the three months leading to June 30, the University increased its holdings in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund—the single largest holding disclosed—from 8.3 million to 9.7 million shares, and the value of those holdings have increased from $205 million to $313 million. Harvard also more than doubled its holdings in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking South Korean and Indian indices—valued at over $200 million—and the total value of its holdings in ETFs tracking Chinese, Brazilian, South African, and Mexican indices increased from roughly $291 million to $472 million. The University reportedly bought nearly seven million shares in an ETF tracking Taiwanese indices—reversing its earlier decision to sell the two million shares it had in the fund as of last September.Other investments of note include over $55 million in an ETF tracking Russian indices, and multi-million dollar repurchases of shares in mining giant BHP Billiton and oil and gas producer China National Offshore Oil Corporation.While the value of Harvard’s equity investments has increased, it remains modest compared to where it stood last September, when the University had nearly $3 billion invested in 213 public equity holdings. Jane Mendillo, president and CEO of HMC, said in an interview with The Crimson in May that she had “accelerated building a cash reserve” last fall—part of a larger policy portfolio change—but that the Company was “aggressively analyzing investment opportunities” and reinvesting cash coming out of the financial crisis. University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment for this article.HMC announced in early August the appointment of two senior investment managers to the Company’s internal team—a move that seems to dovetail with the apparent emphasis on emerging markets and Asia.

Former Associate Professor of History and Art and Architecture Jennifer L. Roberts was appointed full professor in the department effective July 1, marking the second tenure in just one year of an American art historian within the historically Eurocentric department.Roberts said she has adjusted her perspective as an academic and teacher with this recent recognition that American art would have a more substantial presence in the department.“The first symptom of having tenure, for me, was driving around Cambridge and feeling like I belong here, which I never really felt before,” Roberts said. “I’ve put a huge investment in this department, particularly in building a program in American art because there really wasn’t one 20 years ago...and it’s nice to know now that I can continue to build on that in a more permanent way.”According to History of Art and Architecture Professor Henri Zerner, Roberts is part of a new generation of younger scholars interested in studying American art with the same kind of investigative intensity and contextualization as those experts in better-entrenched areas of art history.“Harvard was very late to the study of American art, and I think it’s an exciting moment for the field to have Harvard go from having zero tenured faculty in the field to having two,” said History of Art and Architecture Professor Robin Kelsey, a fellow American art expert who received tenure this past January. “My own enjoyment of getting tenure would have been very half-hearted had she not.”Kelsey—who calls himself and Roberts “conjoined academic twins”—said his colleague has transformed American art history with her command of an expansive range of time studied. Americanist art history traditionally ends at 1945, after which point artwork is considered within the realm of the contemporary, according to Kelsey. But Roberts challenges the demarcation by intertwining the contemporary moment and the art and social histories of the United States.The broad spectrum of Roberts’ work is especially apparent in her first book, “Mirror-Travels: Robert Smithson and History,” which developed from her dissertation at Yale. The book examines how the work of land artist Smithson “absorbed, transformed, and sometimes refused the historical traditions that it connected to,” Roberts said.In the vein of her wide-ranging scholarship, Roberts’s current project—“Pictures in Transit: Matter, Memory, and Migration in Early American Art”—studies how art travels and creates a web of communication between disparate sites.In her time at Harvard, Roberts—the three-time recipient of the Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize for Excellence in the Work of Undergraduates and in the Art of Teaching—has duly accrued recognition for her pedagogy, Kelsey said.“‘Dedicated’ is a weak word to use to describe her devotion to her students and her scholarship,” Kelsey said. “She works amazingly hard.”Roberts graduated from Stanford University in 1992 and went on to Yale to receive her Ph.D. in 2000. For the following two years, she served as a postdoctoral faculty fellow at Syracuse University. She took a post as an assistant professor at Harvard in 2002.—Staff writer Esther I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Crimson editor Amelia E. Lester ’05 has been named managing editor of The New Yorker. 
The 26-year-old previously worked as a fact checker for the magazine and will replace Kate Julian, who is stepping down to freelance and to join her husband in Washington, D.C. Lester most recently worked as an editor at the Paris Review, a literary magazine based in New York City.
During her undergraduate years at The Crimson, the Australian native worked as an executive editor of the weekend magazine Fifteen Minutes and later as an editorial columnist.
Lester often alluded to her Aussie roots in her FM pieces, even writing a guide to “Australian Slang from A to Zed.”
“She has always been well-known and respected for her tremendous literary knowledge across all genres,” said former Crimson President Erica K. Jalli ’05. “She was a standout talent in our Crimson guard, combining dry wit with a highly cerebral style.”
Lester was also features editor at the Harvard Advocate and editor of Let’s Go 2004: Australia.
During her senior year at Harvard, Lester joined the editorial staff of Harvard Magazine as one of the two Berta Greenwald Ledecky Undergraduate Fellows and wrote several columns on topics ranging from surviving the black-pinstripe-suit-days of her senior year job hunt to navigating life after college, which she likened to dousing herself in her mother’s perfume and playing dress-up as a five-year-old.
The former Adams House resident graduated from the College with a degree in English and American literature and language.
“I’m looking forward to returning to the New Yorker and working hard in a new role,” Lester wrote in an e-mailed statement. 
A spokesperson for The New Yorker declined to comment for this article, stating that it would be “premature” at this point.

Thesis writers, students working in labs, international students, and members of 19 varsity sports team will likely be able to stay on campus during Harvard's Jan.4 through Jan. 24 J-Term—everyone else, probably not.
While exceptions will be made for certain cases and some clubs such as the Hasting Pudding Theatricals also may be allowed to stay on campus over the break, College officials do not plan on allowing more than 1,000 undergraduates to stay on campus over the nearly three week long gap, according to Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer. Students who are allowed to stay on campus will eat in Annenberg. The application is scheduled to come out in the next few weeks and will be due in October.
The teams that will be allowed to stay on campus include basketball, swimming, and track.
For more information on J-Term plans, read Monday's Crimson article here.

Those packs of freshmen aren't the only new thing on campus today. Rapper and twitter guru MC Hammer is at the Faculty Club now to deliver a lecture on social media. This is his second talk on twitter at Harvard in less than a year (last February, he was at the Business School).
It's $439 dollars to get in, but you can watch live on CNN's website. The big man himself gives his keynote at 11:50 a.m. There's also a free after party at Om beginning at 5:30 this evening, but no word yet on whether Hammer will make an appearance.

FlyBy greets you!  Here's to hoping your move-in is going better than this guy's:
Freshmen, take note.  Daddy won't be able to park his SUV right at the entryway door next year.  But with the exception of those  foul beings who decided not only to store their huge, cage-like furniture pieces late in the game and close to the door, but also to take their precious time removing them, storage didn't look too bad all around.
That is, with the exception of Adams:
Immediately upon entering the bowels of the house, you're assaulted with a landfill of dusty refrigerators just at the bottom of the steps.  The labyrinth that is Adams' basement is made worse by the fact that they've decided to willingly use halls as storage space, and throw junk in whatever tiny, far-off closet they could find.
Yeah, that's turned over paint in there.  Good luck to all!

And you thought you were the only one creative enough to restyle yourself for the new school year.
After two weeks of renovations, the Starbucks store located in the Garage unveiled its new assets Saturday—including a row of wooden booths, a larger space for customers waiting on line, and a brighter tenor. Remember those inutile velvet curtains and those circular tables that you could never seem to claim? All gone. (The Ventis are staying, though.)
According to shift supervisor Alyssa Criscuoll, the popular locale had been completely gutted and renovated to cater to student customers, with a larger cafe area that offers more seating and a larger waiting space to decrease crowding. Read on to find out what else Criscuoll says has replaced "that really early 90's orange thing we had going on."
Criscuoll says every store in the Starbucks chain is examined for renovations every few years, and she expects many other stores to undergo similar changes—plus, the store in the Garage had several pieces of old equipment that needed to be replaced anyway.
Not to mention the ambiance was less than current.
"Aesthetically, the colors are completely different—more black and white with dark wood, instead of that really early 90's orange thing we had going on," Criscuoll says of the renovated store. On a large black board hanging on the wall, she plans to paint a map of the world that illustrates the origins of the store's coffee.
The renovations were corporate decisions beyond the purview of the store's staff, but Criscuoll and some of her fellow workers wish they had been consulted on parts of the planning. As a result of the renovations, the staff has lost some wiggle room "behind the lines," or the barrier that keeps workers behind the food bar and cash register.
Though most of the customers Criscuoll has spoken with praised the "roomier and welcoming" renovations, one individual offered some criticism of the store's auditory drawback—the high ceiling and open space could yield poor acoustics.
"It gets really loud easily, so studying might be a little more challenging in the store," Criscuoll says. So much for changing it up for students.
