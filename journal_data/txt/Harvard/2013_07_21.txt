After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Massachusetts State Senator Barry Finegold (D-Andover) moves to pass a landmark education reform bill in Massachusetts, the high achievement of earlier reforms is being drowned out by the controversy surrounding charter schools in the Bay State. That controversy threatens a bill with enormous potential to provide a quality education to even more Massachusetts students.
Charter schools have constituted a part of the state’s educational landscape since 1993, when the first of two education reform bills allowed the state to grant charters for nontraditional schools. In 2010, the second major reform bill raised a mandated cap on charter schools while giving the state broader powers to reform underperforming traditional schools.
Charter provisions included, these two bills have been major successes for the state. In the 20 years since the Education Reform Act of 1993 was passed, Massachusetts has become a national leader in education. The state’s reform agenda secured its 2010 victory in President Obama’s Race to the Top competition, garnering more funds for its education system. Massachusetts has emerged as the paragon of an education-fueled knowledge economy, with high graduation rates, superior test scores, and challenging curricula.
Senator Finegold’s bill—An Act to Further Narrow the Achievement Gap—expands upon these successes. It gives struggling schools the power to lengthen their school days and staff their classroom with regard to effectiveness as well as seniority. The bill also eliminates most restrictions on opening new charter schools in the state—which has drawn the bill’s most vocal opposition.
Massachusetts charter schools, on the whole, are a success story. They exist mainly in poorer communities, serving families for whom the local district schools simply are not working. These families cannot afford to move to the suburbs or send their children to private schools, as more affluent families might. Without charter schools, poorer families would have no choice in their children’s education.
Charter schools provide that choice, and most exhibit better test scores and higher eventual graduation rates than neighboring district schools. Eventual graduation rates—as opposed to four-year graduation rates—measure the percentage of students that graduate from the school in any amount of time, while four-year graduation rates only measure the percentage of students that graduate from high school in a span of four years.
This distinction is important because many charter schools do not engage in social promotion—a practice that allows students to ascend grade levels and even graduate with their classmates regardless of whether or not those students have mastered grade-level curricula. This means that some charter school students will take a year or two more to graduate than will their peers in traditional public schools. Those students, however, will have graduated not because of social promotion, but because they have mastered the curriculum.
These schools are high performing, and students want to attend them, yet there is still a public battle over the role of Bay State charter schools. Many opponents allege that charters sap funding from the “actual” public schools and that their performance results from nothing more than cherry-picking the very best students—leaving those with special needs, low English proficiency, or less motivation behind. They also contend that charters trample on teachers’ rights and concern themselves only with profit.
As with any debate, there are valid issues to be worked out concerning charter schools—but at least in Massachusetts, these are not them. Massachusetts charter schools are completely public schools. They are accountable to the state government—which monitors charters, regulates them, and can close them if it sees fit—and they cannot charge tuition. Being public schools, they cannot—and do not—engage in selective or merit-based admissions. As to trampling on teachers’ rights, Massachusetts charter schools are indeed not often unionized—but even in those that are not, teachers are paid at comparable (or better) rates to their traditional school counterparts, and they freely choose to teach there.
These allegations are particularly unfortunate because they obfuscate more substantive charter school policy debates. The argument that Massachusetts charter schools “cherry-pick” their students, for example, is false. But when one looks beyond the sound bytes, there is room for improvement in charter school admissions policies.
Currently, every charter school is required to have a separate application. Because demand for charter seats so far outweighs the seats available, most families have to apply to several charters persistently in order to gain entrance to one. This means that most students who even apply probably have family members who are active in their education. That difference, charge charter opponents, could account for the better performance.
Proponents of charter schools, far from exploiting the situation to drive up their test scores, have actually offered solutions to the problem. Some charter proponents in Boston advocate a single, streamlined application process for all the district’s charter schools. Parents would only need to apply once to get their children in the all of the various lotteries. The hope is that more children from high-need backgrounds—often with working parents or no parents at home at all—would benefit from a system that would require less time from the parents just to get in the door.
The battle over charter schools is largely a political ploy that undermines substantive policy work. Charters have been proven good models where students thrive and succeed. So have most traditional public schools in Massachusetts. Our goal should be to encourage schools that work while reforming schools that don’t—which is exactly what An Act to Further Narrow the Achievement Gap does.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A group of approximately 15 University workers, student labor activists, and union representatives gathered outside Holyoke Center late Friday afternoon to protest what they claimed were instances of discrimination against employees and retaliation against union activism by Harvard.
 
Carrying signs and marching in a circle, protesters chanted in support of three workers, including Nassim Kerkache, who currently serves as coordinator of Harvard Yard Mail Center. In a phone interview before the rally, Kerkache said he was informed at the start of this month by management that there was no longer a need for a coordinator for the mail center. He said he was given the choice of accepting either an effective salary grade demotion or a layoff.
 
Kerkache, who said he has served in his current post for about nine years, alleged that management’s actions were motivated in part by racism and as retaliation against his involvement with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. Kerkache serves as a local representative in the union.
 
Kerkache, who first moved to the United States from Algeria in 1994, claimed that his manager had previously made comments criticizing his English skills, education, and manners, which he said he found offensive.
When asked about Kerkache’s allegations, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin declined to comment, saying he would not speak regarding personnel matters. Kerkache’s manager did not respond to requests for comment Friday.
 
Kerkache said that he was originally told that to stay employed by the University he would have to take a position three salary grades lower than his current role. According to union representative Geoff Carens, Harvard University Mail Services has since offered to move Kerkache to a position that is one salary grade, rather than three, below his current position.
Still, Carens, who helped lead the protest outside Holyoke Friday, said in an interview after the demonstration that he and Kerkache would “definitely” consider taking legal action if Kerkache is not allowed to stay at his current salary grade. Carens said he is currently waiting to hear back from a Harvard human resources representative in the midst of correspondence about Kerkache’s case.
For his part, Kerkache said the situation was a “shock” to him. “I love my job. I’ve been here for a long time,” he said.
Demonstrators also spoke out Friday against what they described as the unfair treatment of two other workers employed by the University. They supported Harvard University Mail Services employee Mamadou Ndiaye, who protesters alleged has unfairly been given fewer work hours than he wants, and Paul J. Casey, a maintenance technician who protesters claimed has been laid off because he took a disability leave. Galvin declined to comment on Ndiaye and Casey’s cases as well.

In a series of reviews, members of The Crimson's summer staff are making a case for the best froyo in the Square. We've already reviewed Pinkberry, Ben and Jerry's, and Yogurtland. Now up: Lizzy's.
Talk of liberty and freedom in the context of frozen yogurt digresses from perhaps the most important question in lactose-consuming circles: Is it wrong for froyo to look and taste like ice cream? At Lizzy's, the answer is a resounding no.
Nowadays, most frozen yogurt chains are rolling out new flavors, new toppings, and new forms of service that overcompensate in their efforts to distinguish themselves from ice cream. "We're unique! Experimental! Different from anything that's come before!” their new product advertisements seem to scream.
If Yogurtland and Pinkberry are easily distracted, prepubescent pimpled boys, Lizzy's is the refined man with the Macklemore haircut who knows what he wants. At Lizzy's, there’s no shame in raspberry chocolate chip frozen yogurt tasting and looking like raspberry chocolate chip ice cream. Take one bite of Lizzy's firm frozen yogurt, and you'll forever regret those runny cups of mainstream froyo brimming with unfortunate combinations of toppings. 
What Lizzy's does with taste it also does with atmosphere. Lizzy's, located at 29 Church St., is all about the traditional ice cream shop experience. With seven frozen yogurt flavors and an attentive staff at your service, Lizzy’s offers refinement where other froyo vendors offer chaos. At Lizzy's, there is no annoyance from loud children overfilling their self-serve containers, no dissatisfaction from foolishly mixing orange and cucumber flavors, no shock from realizing there are no strawberry toppings that day.
Lizzy's understands that the supposed innovations of upstart froyo chains are vain attempts to craft a unique identity. Lizzy's understands that it is futile to deny the long-established ascendancy of ice cream, which has been and always will be the apex of human achievement. Lizzy's understands that to be delicious, froyo must embrace its roots.
Go to Lizzy's, and you will understand too.
