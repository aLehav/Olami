After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For several reasons, it was a hard decision to write about “Pinkerton.” The first is that since its infamously tepid reception in 1996, which sent Weezer on an identity-searching downward spiral, critics have all but begged frontman Rivers Cuomo for forgiveness, decorating the album with perfect scores and calling it one of the best releases of its decade. To write about “Pinkerton” is to, inevitably, contribute my own washed-out opinion on an album whose legacy has already been cemented in Weezer’s discography and, indeed, among its contemporaries.
The second reason is that I really fucking hate “Pinkerton.” I hate its casual racism and misogyny. I hate its anthematic choruses that wouldn’t turn heads if my high school’s marching band played them at our feebly attended pep rallies. I hate how in the very first line of the album, Cuomo offhandedly remarks, “I’m tired, so tired / I’m tired of having sex.” So when I say that “Pinkerton” is an important album to me, I don’t mean that listening to the album sends chills down my spine or transports me to another dimension. In fact, “Pinkerton” has the opposite effect: the world in which “Pinkerton” resides feels like that of my own, familiar mind.
“Pinkerton” is a voice for the masses—for me, much more so than anything AFI or Fall Out Boy ever wrote. While Davey Havok and Patrick Stump were singing about teenage angst and unrequited romance, Cuomo was describing himself sniffing and licking fan mail just to exchange weeks-old saliva residue with a Japanese girl he had never met. And while critics called “Pinkerton” Cuomo’s way of dealing with his newfound fame, I think it wasn’t the fame that drove him to create the album, but a more deeply rooted and unsettling instinct that everybody faces as they grow up. But to describe the antagonist of “Pinkerton” as adolescence is similarly trivializing. It’s a deeply disturbing but—ultimately—human idea that rubs gratingly against our domesticated, repressed society. Instead of burying it like the rest of us, Cuomo makes love to it and then beats it to death, leaving it strewn across the whole of “Pinkerton.”
In a sense, “Pinkerton” is Cuomo’s “Lolita.” It doesn’t deal with issues quite as dark as pedophilia, but it similarly tests what society is ready for regarding honesty in art. “Pinkerton” brings up questions that I refuse to answer, because daring to answer them feels like teetering on the brink of a deep, disgusting sinfulness. Sure, I can claim with confidence that it’s wrong to exoticize Japanese girls. But is it wrong to admit that sometimes you hate yourself because you find yourself doing it? And is it wrong to find that kind of relatable?
The truth is that every cringeworthy line in “Pinkerton” is just as much a reflection of the world as it is a reflection of Cuomo. Being a man, I can’t forgive Cuomo for the things he says. But the truth is that I would never have the guts to talk so openly about my own internalized misogyny and racism, much less announce it to the world on the heels of a multi-platinum debut album. It’s all too easy to turn Cuomo into a martyr, but in my eyes, “Pinkerton” is just a thinly veiled attempt to talk about the prejudices that society perpetuates in secret. In that light, it’s the rest of us, the silent masses, who are the guilty ones.
The urge to condemn “Pinkerton” as tasteless rock fodder is exacerbated in part because its most superficial moments are often the ones that hit hardest. The closing track, “Butterfly,” is by far the most tender on the album and wields some of its heftiest lines. “If I’m a dog, then you’re a bitch,” Cuomo whispers, delivering the expletive almost lovingly. And of course there’s the shockingly blatant chorus, in which he declares, “I’m sorry for what I did / I did what my body told me to, I didn’t mean to do you harm.” But it’s the lines that are interspersed among these remarks, Cuomo’s internal monologue, that make “Butterfly” sound more introspective than offensive. “I guess you’re as real as me, maybe I can live with that,” he muses. And if the role of “Butterfly” as the album’s thesis wasn’t clear enough already, Cuomo ends the track—and “Pinkerton”—with a simple apology: “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” Sure, Cuomo spends a lot of time milking his own faults, but he then wages war on them with ideas as beautiful as his faults are disgusting. It’s a simple thought, but it’s one I’ve never had. That’s why, when I first heard “Butterfly,” it almost brought me to tears. Although I find fragments of myself in Cuomo at his worst, I can only admire Cuomo at his best from afar.
In retrospect, it’s hard to imagine how fans and critics alike missed the point of “Pinkerton” when, throughout most of the album, Cuomo couldn’t be any more explicit. In the bridge of “El Scorcho,” the lead single that doomed the album, he frantically professes, “How stupid is it? I can’t talk about it, I gotta sing about it and make a record.” But in spite of this slew of unadorned confessions, I remember that I, too, hate “Pinkerton.” I remember that the same lead single opens with a racist turn-off (“Goddamn, you half-Japanese girls / Do it to me every time.”) and then proceeds to reduce a woman to a few common interests and quirks.
Regrettably, at the end of the day I can’t separate myself from these ideas and claim that “Pinkerton” doesn’t speak to me. For that reason, the war Cuomo wages on the album has caught me in its crossfire, turning his confusion, uncertainty, and self-hatred into my own. Perhaps that’s why “Pinkerton” is so difficult to love: it’s loathing, not remorse, that Cuomo exudes. The self-destruction of Weezer, ironically, was born out of the mass misinterpretation of the album’s own self-destructive nature. I still fucking hate “Pinkerton.” But the more I listen to it, the less unfamiliar the album’s darkest points become. Sure, I think half-Japanese girls are pretty hot. I’m just too much of a coward to admit it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leelah Alcorn’s suicide stands as a rotten cherry atop a year stained by intolerance and hostility. But before I start on how messed up this world is, with people who harm others out of prejudice, parents who wrong their children out of narrow-mindedness, and institutions that stunt social progress, allow me to clarify that I will be using “trans" as an umbrella term for people whose self-identification or expression transgresses established gender categories or boundaries, including transgender, transsexual, intersex, and genderqueer individuals. “Trans” will also serve to avoid discrepancies over what the appropriate way to label a certain identity is.
We’ll start with the facts. On December 28, Leelah Alcorn, a 17 year-old, transgender girl from Ohio, walked into Interstate 71, where she was hit and killed by a semi-trailer. She had left two queued posts, which were automatically published on her blog: her suicide note—the original version of which has been deleted, along with her blog—and apologies to a few people. In them, she attributes the unhappiness that prompted her suicide to issues faced by many trans people. The persistence of these issues, even in the 21st century, is more than disappointing. The social epidemic of discrimination against people outside of heteronormative canons has to stop.
While Leelah is a single person, this is in no way an isolated incident. A study by the American Association of Suicidology states that “sexual minority status is a key risk factor for life-threatening behaviors among transgender youth,” which is disturbingly accurate. The same study also reveals that 25 percent of a sample of trans individuals had tried to commit suicide, and a larger percentage had considered it. The Youth Suicide Prevention Program estimates that 50 percent of trans youth have at least one suicide attempt by the time they turn 20. If there is a group in which nearly two out of every four members try to kill themselves, there is a major issue that needs to be addressed.
It doesn’t take much to see a pattern of discrimination in teenage trans suicides. Chloe Lacey, Riley Moscatel, Lexie Lopez-Brandies. All of them faced discrimination throughout their lives, and we should feel their pain. The issue at hand is that misinformation and ignorance can easily turn into bigotry and transphobia, leading parents and others to do what is worst despite intending what is best. Leelah’s letter describes this very clearly: “I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”
Because of their biases, Leelah writes, her parents continued calling her Josh even after she asked them not to do so (and even after she died), ignored her pleas for help to deal with depression, and made it easier for her to transition from life to death than from guy to girl. When they finally took her to see a therapist, it was for conversion therapy, which has been proved to cause deep harm and scar the individuals undergoing this modern-day form of psychological torture. We should see Leelah’s suicide as the consequence of a collective mistake. But we should also see it as she wanted it to be seen—a cause of social change, a catalyst for learning to reshape misconceptions and bring about respect.
Some might blame Leelah’s parents religion for their inability to accept their daughter for who she was—she certainly does. However, I do not think that looking down on people with those religious beliefs is useful in any way. We mustn’t combat discrimination with more discrimination, and while Leelah’s parents’ transphobia might stem from Christianity, there are Christians in favor of trans rights, just as there are non-religious people who are against equality, whose attitudes originate from ignorance and fear. As Leelah stated, “gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better,” in order for everyone to have an integral education and to better appreciate all forms of human diversity. There is no better way of improving the current state of affairs than educating people and changing ancient policies that do not favor equal rights.
For instance, half of the schools in Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network’s 2013 comprehensive National School Climate Survey didn’t have a supportive student club for LGBT students, and the ones that did, were mostly Gay-Straight Alliances, which, while inclusive, contribute to bi- and trans-erasure. Pride Clubs and Queer Alliances, on the other hand, might be a better alternative; they include students outside of the homo-heterosexual spectrum, and also address the different types of gender expression that people have.
Similarly, creating a curriculum that incorporates LGBT-related information—only 31 percent of schools in the survey do, and over a third of those actually cover it negatively—and providing more accessibility to reading materials and other curricular resources that can be used to further understanding of LGBT issues would result in students being more accepting of forms of gender expression and sexual orientation that differ from the norm.
Educating young minds to be more appreciative of human diversity can make a huge difference in how they will act in the future, which potentially creates a safer environment for trans and other queer people. We are in need of laws that protect trans people. Only a few states have made medical care affordable to the majority trans people by banning trans health exclusion in insurance plans, and currently, only 10 states have laws that that protect victims of hate crimes based on their gender identity. We need to go beyond that, and give trans people the protection they deserve by offering them the same treatment that everyone else gets.
“The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,” Leelah’s letter reads. Discrimination must end, and this can only happen if people are educated and equality reached. I am appealing for public education about trans issues, for those who are no longer in school to look for resources and educate themselves, for healthcare for trans people—which is a necessity, not a commodity—for prejudice to be left behind, for conversion therapy to be banned, and for Leelah’s death, as well as those of other trans teenagers, to mean something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 7, 2015, at 9:29 p.m.
On the heels of national attention surrounding allegations that he had sexual relations with an allegedly trafficked minor, Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, took legal action Monday to intervene in the civil case in which the accusations surfaced as part of an effort to refute them.
The lawyers whom Dershowitz claims fabricated the accusations against him, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, responded Tuesday by suing him for defamation. Their complaint accuses Dershowitz of “initiat[ing] a massive public media assault on [their] reputation and character.”
Dershowitz’s court filing Monday came in response to allegations communicated in a Dec. 30 filing in federal court in Florida alleging that a woman, identified as “Jane Doe No. 3,” had sexual relations with Dershowitz in several locations when she was underage at the behest of Jeffrey E. Epstein, a billionaire who previously went to prison after pleading guilty in state court to soliciting prostitution. A philanthropist, Epstein has donated millions of dollars to Harvard.
The allegations against Dershowitz were filed as part of a civil case challenging Epstein’s original plea deal, which Dershowitz helped to negotiate. The filing alleges that Dershowitz negotiated that plea deal, which protected Epstein and any “co-conspirators” from prosecution in federal court, to provide “protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida.”
Dershowitz’s Monday motion to intervene in the civil case calls the allegations against him “categorically false” and requests an intervention so that Dershowitz can protect his reputation. Dershowitz also made a declaration, under penalty of perjury, in which he wrote that he “did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe No. 3,” whom he calls a “serial liar.”
The Monday filing challenges the credibility of last week’s accusations against Dershowitz on several grounds, arguing that they are not only fabricated, but also “wholly irrelevant” to the civil case under which they were filed. Dershowitz, in his declaration, alleges that the alleged victim's lawyers “inserted this false and defamatory charge” and “placed it in a legal proceeding, in a public filing, in bad faith in an effort to have the media report it.”
For his part, Dershowitz has denounced the allegations in interviews with several media outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Crimson, among others, and appeared on the BBC and CNN.
Those media appearances were the target of a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the alleged victim's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, claiming that Dershowitz made statements that were “false and known by him to be false at the time they were made.” The lawyers’ complaint, filed in federal court in Florida, cites Dershowitz’s interview with CNN as well as statements he made to other national and international media sources with the claim that they are defamatory because they attack the “fitness of the Plaintiffs to engage in the honored profession of the practice of law.”
In an interview Tuesday, Dershowitz said he “welcome[s]” the lawsuit against him as an opportunity to combat what he claims are false accusations.
“This gives me a weapon that I didn’t previously have, and the weapon is the power of deposition,” Dershowitz said. “I can now subpoena them, put them under oath, subject them to cross-examination, and prosecute them for perjury if they lie.”
“This is a very positive development for me,” he said.
Edwards and Cassell declined to comment beyond their own court filing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping consecutive games to Big Six opponents, the Harvard men’s basketball team (8-3) righted the ship with a win over Grand Canyon to close out its three-game road swing. The Crimson return to Massachusetts looking to extend its win streak when it takes on Saint Rose (5-8) Monday at Lavietes Pavilion (7:00 EST, Ivy League Digital Network).  Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard aims to kick off 2015 with a victory.
Retaking the Glass: In losses to both Arizona State and Virginia, Harvard failed to establish itself early inside, unusual for a Tommy Amaker offense. Senior center Kenyatta Smith, the most traditional back-to-the-basket player on the roster, played 22 combined minutes in both games without a field goal. Not coincidentally, the Crimson’s bounce-back performance against Grand Canyon hinged on a 38-24 advantage on the boards. Playing a team that started four guards, Harvard went to the paint—via dribble or pass—early and often. A lack of a strong post presence has been a theme throughout the Crimson’s three losses, so look for Amaker to establish Smith and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi inside early Monday night.
Finding His Range: The most positive development for the Crimson against Grand Canyon was the play of junior co-captain Siyani Chambers. The team’s starting point guard had made just 10 of his previous 39 shots heading into the contest, but sunk five of 10 and led the team in scoring for the first time this season with 16 points. However, Chambers is still shooting a career-low 33 percent from the field while posting career lows in rebounds, points, and free throw attempts a game. Saint Rose—a team who has never before played a Division I opponent in regular season play—is an ideal game for Chambers to get back on track.
Home Cooking: Monday’s game is a brief intermission for the Crimson before Harvard takes the road again for a three-game swing against Dartmouth, Boston College, and Bryant. Overall, the Crimson has not lost at home in 2014-2015 and the team carries a nine-game home win streak into the contest. Since the 2010-2011 season, Harvard has had two home winning streaks of 20 games or longer and boasts a 55-3 record overall within the friendly confines of Lavietes Pavilion. For perspective, that home field advantage is third in the country over that time frame, and within shouting distance of first (Duke, 70-3).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than 24 hours after beating Brown, the No. 6/6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team continued to climb the ECAC standings Saturday, picking up its fifth consecutive conference win.
Despite trailing early against rival Yale (7-7-1, 4-4-0 ECAC), the Crimson (8-2-2, 7-1-1) came back to defeat the Bulldogs, 3-1, at Ingalls Rink to close out a successful road trip.
"We got ready obviously for Friday first," junior forward Miye D’Oench said. "But [we were also] thinking about Yale and what we could do to put ourselves in the best position to win both games."
The second time Harvard took the ice this weekend, it met a Bulldog team eager to make a statement quickly. This statement came less than five minutes into the game when sophomore forward Krista Yip-Chuck sent the puck into the back of the net to give Yale an early edge.
The Bulldogs kept this lead for most of the first period, only to find themselves down, 2-1, as the first period whistle blew. These Harvard goals came from freshman forward Lexie Laing and sophomore forward Sydney Daniels.
Laing’s equalizer came in the final minute of the frame, giving the rookie her seventh point of the season. But a mere 25 seconds later, Daniels turned the Crimson’s sigh of relief into a full-on cheer, putting Harvard ahead with another goal.
This goal marked Daniels’ third of the weekend and eighth of her sophomore season, matching her total from her rookie year.
“We’ve scored first; other teams have scored first,” Harvard coach Katie Stone said. “You’ve got to be resilient, you’ve got to bounce back. There’s still a lot of hockey to play and you’ve got to stick to your game plan and just chip away at it. Then usually good things come your way."
That scoreline would stand for much of the game, as the next goal did not come until midway through the third period.
Determined to break the scoring drought that had set in during the middle frame, the Crimson solidified its lead seven minutes into the period. After a string of passes found her in front of the net, senior defender Marissa Gedman put the game away.
Showcasing its depth, Harvard had four different skaters record assists in addition to the three goal-scorers.
In the first period, junior forward Mary Parker’s sixth assist of the season found her former high school teammate Laing, while the other helper came from Arizona native, senior forward Lyndsey Fry.
Tri-captain forward Samantha Reber and D'Oench were both awarded points for assisting Gedman in the final frame, bringing their point totals to 11 and 14 respectively.
"It makes our team more whole when everyone's working together," D'Oench said. "It's a long season, and you can't rely on one player."
In contrast to the dramatics of the opening period, both teams went scoreless the next time they stepped on the ice. But the game became more physical. While the first twenty minutes saw no penalties, each team received three in the second. Harvard held the Bulldogs zero-for-four on power plays on the night, but failed to capitalize on its own opportunities as well, going zero-for-three.
"It's always difficult when you're playing a man down or a man up," D'Oench said. "Either way, we adjusted well and did what we needed to do."
Helping to stop Yale’s opportunities on the man advantage was junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer. The All-American netminder played a full 60 minutes for Harvard, making 23 saves on the night.
Stone attributed the depth of her team to good recruiting and the team's internal competition.
“It’s a Division I hockey program, and you want to have internal competition,” Stone said. “It’s good for everybody, and it's paying dividends for our team.”
Harvard came into the contest having beaten Brown, 6-1, the night before. On its last conference road trip back in November, the Crimson had been struggling to prove itself as a competitor in the ECAC and on the national stage, picking up a loss and a tie to St. Lawrence and Clarkson respectively.
But even now as its record and statistics improve, the Crimson remains focused only on improving itself.
“The number one goal is to just keep getting better, individually and collectively,” Stone said. “[That means] taking more ownership, stepping up, [and] playing to their capabilities. We’ve asked each kid what they can bring every day, and that’s what we expect from them.”

Just 2.2 seconds separated the Harvard women’s basketball team from a tough two-point loss and a chance to complete its second-half comeback in overtime, but the clock ran out on its chance at victory.
After junior forward AnnMarie Healy blocked a drive by Chattanooga sophomore Chelsey Shumpert to send the ball out of bounds, Lady Mocs freshman Keiana Gilbert sunk a buzzer-beating layup off of an inbounds pass to seal the win.
A strong second half comeback wasn’t enough for the Crimson (6-7), as it fell to Chattanooga (12-3) by a score of 54-52 on Monday afternoon in front of its home crowd. Though Harvard never held the lead in the contest, it was able to overcome a 12-point deficit in order to tie the game up, 52-52, with just 29 seconds remaining following a 13-2 run.
After holding the Lady Mocs to just five points in the last 10 minutes of the game, it came down to the last possession to seal the victory for Chattanooga.
When comparing the two halves, fans would think they had watched two completely different games days or weeks apart, never mind just the length of the halftime break. At the end of the first half, the Crimson was behind by a score of 26-17.
The team got off to a slow start, failing to put the ball in the net for nearly seven minutes. Meanwhile, Chattanooga went on an eight-point run from the start.
After the Crimson pulled within one on two occasions with under five minutes in the first frame, the Mocs went on another run to bring the lead up to nine to end the half.
“In the first half we were taking our normal shots, but they just weren’t falling,” Healy said. “We went scoreless for way too long.”
Turnovers and fouls plagued Harvard and gave Chattanooga extra opportunities on the offensive end. The Crimson gave up eight turnovers and had six fouls in the first half, compared to the Mocs’ two and one, respectively. Chattanooga capitalized on the turnovers it was given throughout the game, scoring 21 points off of turnovers compared to Harvard’s seven.
But the Crimson came alive in the second half, particularly due to the play of Healy, who had a career-high 20 points in the contest, 18 of them coming in the second half. Harvard’s shooting improved as a whole, outshooting the Mocs 35-28 in the second half, shooting 60 percent compared to 29.9 percent in the first.
Senior forward Temi Fagbenle also had a strong game, earning her sixth double-double of the season with 10 points and 12 rebounds. The combination of Fagbenle and Healy allowed the Crimson to get back in the game, as the pair contributed 29 of Harvard’s 35 second-half points. The duo alone outscored the entire Mocs team in the second frame.
“We definitely knew that we had an advantage in size and so we wanted to kind of utilize that as much as possible so we tried to get the ball to AnnMarie and Temi inside the paint,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “We could pretty much score at will in there, so we tried to make that adjustment.”
Despite its loss, Harvard has a lot to take away from this game as it heads into the Ivy League portion of the season. Having faced nationally competitive teams and holding its own in many of the contests thus far this season, the Crimson is confident going into Ivy play.
“This game, even though we lost, gives us confidence that we can be competitive with top-25 teams and that if we play to our potential we really can beat anyone that we step on the court with,” Healy said. “I know that we came out with a loss but it was very close and I think when our shots do fall and the pieces come together, I see very good things for us in the Ivies.”
The Crimson heads on the road in its next contest against Dartmouth on January 10th before it returns home for its next four Ivy League matchups at Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The month of December held no shortage of ups and downs for the Harvard men’s basketball team (9-3). But after turning the page to 2015, the Crimson is rolling again.
In its first action from Lavietes Pavilion since early December, Harvard scored early and often Monday, cruising to its first victory of the calendar year over Saint Rose (5-9), 84-38.
In a contest that saw all 15 active members of the roster hit the floor, sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan paved the way for the Crimson, posting a career-high 14 points to go along with seven rebounds in just 16 minutes.
Following the game, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called the sophomore’s production “outstanding.”
Eight minutes into the contest, Edosomwan already had four points off the bench. The six-foot-nine sophomore tried to make it six, but he failed to throw down a dunk not once, but twice.
But with the help of junior point guard Siyani Chambers, the ball found its way back to Edosomwan a third time, and the big man delivered. The sophomore laid the ball up and in, drawing a foul and converting the three-point chance to extend the Crimson’s lead to 16-10.
“Coach [Amaker] always says ‘Next play, next play,’” Edosomwan said. “That’s what I wanted to do tonight. I missed a couple dunks, so I said, ‘Alright,’ and I finished.”
The shot for Edosomwan came in the middle of an 8-0 run for Harvard. Once the score had reached 20-10, Amaker went to his reserves, but after five quick points from the Golden Knights, the coach went back to his core.
The decision paid off, as the Crimson came out of the timeout in attack mode. Sparked by five quick points from Chambers and four from senior forward Steve-Moundou-Missi, Harvard got the lead back to double digits, where it would remain for the rest of the game.
Chambers put a cap on the Crimson’s dominant first half seconds before the buzzer sounded, delivering an alley-oop to junior wing Agunwa Okolie to bring the score to 43-21.
Hitting three three-point shots over the course of a 23-6 run to close the half was sophomore guard Corbin Miller, who finished the game with 12 points in a team-high 22 minutes.
“[I wanted] to come in and play at 100 percent for however many minutes I played,” Miller said. “As long as I’m in there, as long as I can give full effort and do what’s asked of me, that’s what it’s all about.”
The Golden Knights, members of the Northeast-10 Conference in Division II, had their work cut out for them in their first-ever contest against a Division I opponent. The 46-point margin of victory for Harvard is the largest it has achieved under Amaker’s tenure, besting a 43-point victory over Daniel Webster in 2008.
The Crimson made use of its size advantage throughout the contest, outscoring Saint Rose in the paint by a 34-10 margin. Harvard also outrebounded the Golden Knights, 47-32.
“I thought the guards were tremendous at looking inside, and I thought the bigs were outstanding at sprinting the floor and getting in early post position,” Amaker said. “When those things go hand in hand, you’re probably going to have a pretty good inside attack.”
Already leading by 22 at halftime, the Crimson kept its foot on the gas, scoring 17 of the game’s first 18 points in the second half.
Senior wing Wesley Saunders, who was held scoreless in the first half, got on the board during this stretch. Entering the contest averaging over 17 points per game, the senior attempted just three shots on the night, finishing with five points.
Likewise, Saint Rose’s leading scorer this season—junior guard Max Weaver—was held without a point in the first half, ending up with just one on the game. As a team, the Golden Knights shot just 21 percent from the field, while Harvard hit on 53 percent of its own shots.
For the Crimson, it was the bench who did the majority of the damage on offense. Behind the efforts of Edosomwan, Miller, and freshman guard Zach Yoshor—who had 11 points of his own—the bench outscored Saint Rose by itself, 50-38.
“Throughout the game when we had a large [lead], we never stopped playing the right way,” Amaker said. “Everyone had a chance to play, and everyone, I thought, played well and did really, really positive things for our team.”

2014 was a great year here at Flyby. You laughed, you shared it with your friends, and then you laughed some more. In no particular order, here are some of the highlights that you won’t want to miss reading (or re-reading):
1. Hollywood at Harvard I & IIIt turns out more than a few Harvard students have already reached levels of stardom through familiar faces and posts in their FB class group. This two-part series features both freshman facebook celebrities and campus celebrity lookalikes. (Spoiler alert: Dean Dingman and Dennis Quaid?!)

2. Fifteen Coldest FreshmenYou’ve read about the fifteen hottest, but with Boston’s icy winters, Flyby knows what you really care about: which freshmen are freezing in the yard.
3. Roving Reporter: How Do You Spell Pforzheimer?Flyby reporters did some groundwork, asking students to spell out the name of one of the Quad House often abbreviated as “Pfoho.” Hilarity ensues.
4. Reasons You Shouldn’t Go to HarvardThere are definitely some cons to being a student at Harvard. Class of 2019, read these reasons carefully before making a final decision (Yes, the Annenberg toaster really is that far away).
5. Kirkland Did What?!– A History of Harvard PresidentsFlyby often finds hidden gems about Harvard’s history, but this post on the namesake of each House takes the cake. (So Kirkland was the one who came up with sectioning and grades!)

7. Freshman v.s.

8. Living Larista Loca at LamontFlyby interviewed a Larista for all the details about working at Lamont Cafe, including a thief (!), the most popular drink order, and the busiest times of the day (or night).

9. Illegal Pets: Beatrice the Cannibal HedgehogPets aren’t allowed in student dorms, but this fall, Flyby conducted an Illegal Pets series (here and here), complete with anonymous interviews of those who have furry friends, perhaps even carnivorous hedgehogs, in their rooms.
10. What Do Harvard Students Do for Fun?It’s no secret that Harvard students care about their extracurriculars, so here's a quiz testing your knowledge of student organizations—you may have a bit of trouble telling whether Harvard Financial Analysts Club, Veritas Consulting Group, or Harvard Investing Club is the real deal.
11. Young Joe Biden Was a HottieJoe Biden gave a speech at the Institute of Politics last October. Therefore, we thought it was only fitting to provide you with a #tbt pic of the VP, as well as some lesser known facts about him (skinny dipping, what?!) Note: He also may have more in common with 2014’s UC VP, Sietse K. Goffard ‘15, than you might think.
12. Wanted: 'Secretary' for Final Club InitiationA Harvard sophomore put up an ad on Craigslist asking for an assistant to deal with the student’s “administrative work,” such as “picking up dry cleaning” and “turning in homework.” #literallywhat

15. Dining DelightsRegardless of whether you’ve been tired of HUDS or just afraid of making unhealthy choices (aka the "940 calorie" blondie brownie controversy), we give you a few delicious and easy-to-follow recipes that can all be made in the dhall– tofu tortilla, anyone?
16. Exclusive Investigative Report: Local Brussels (Spr)OutageEveryone loves Clover's brussels sprouts sandwich and when the future of this sandwich was jeopardized, Ivan B.K. Levingston '17 rose to the occasion.
