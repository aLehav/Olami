After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Right in the heart of East Los Angeles, at the corner of Cesar Chavez Boulevard, lies a sand-colored two-story building faced with turquoise tiling and bathed in a rainbow mosaic. In the 1980s, the building — then home to Self Help Graphics & Art — existed as a creative and mutual aid space for East L.A.’s Chicanx community and a monument to the Chicanx Civil Rights Movement of the ’60s and ’70s. There, aspiring and practicing Chicanx artists alike were encouraged to break with colonial ideologies and learn to celebrate and value their roots. Spearheaded by Franciscan nun and artist Sister Karen Boccalero, Self Help Graphics served as a home base for East L.A.’s activists, artists, poets, and punks — all of which could be seen flitting in and out of the community art studio’s cerulean doors.
By the mid 1970s, Willie Herrón, an artist and founding member of Chicanx punk band Los Illegals, and Joe Suquett (better known as Joe Vex), joined forces with Sister Karen to found Club Vex on the top floor of the Self Help Graphics building. This all-ages punk club, set up twice a month, was created to provide East L.A.’s burgeoning Chicanx punk scene with a community performance venue and meeting hub. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, The Vex was deeply ingrained in punk legend as the place where Chicanxs and other Angelenos could go to see the musical revolutionaries at the forefront of the Chicanx punk movement — punk bands like Los Illegals — unfettered in all their rage and glory.
The East L.A. punk scene, while less popularized than its Hollywood counterpart, was significant in its representation and advancement of Chicanx identities and causes. Taking up the mantle of Los Saicos from Peru, these L.A. punk bands desired to both embrace and project their shared experience of Latinidad through music.
Los Illegals, for example, first broke into the East L.A. punk scene with their politically-charged 1981 release, “El Lay.” In the song, Herrón sings against the deportation of his stepfather, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, as civil rights activist Jesus "Xiuy" Velo’s bass drives the song into a violent frenzy of smashing cymbals and cutting lyrics. “Being illegals / we can’t all be wrong,” he shouts, his message echoing that of the Chicanx Movement. “Is this the price / You have to pay / When you come / To the U.S.A.?”
In another song, “We Don’t Need a Tan,” Herrón sings a curt warning about dangers of the American government and its treatment of fellow Chicanxs. “The federal tax man says / ‘Don’t leave us alone’ / And all those politicians wanna / They wanna swallow your home,” he sings, as drummer Bill Reyes fires away into an intense, violent rhythm.
Other bands like The Zeros, a Chicanx punk band who many dubbed the “Mexican Ramones,” explicitly used Mexican musical influences in their otherwise purely-punk songs. In “Rico Amour,” for example, the band makes use of more folkloric percussion under the heavy, sludgy riffs of guitarist Robert Lopez, later known as El Vez.
With the prominence afforded by venues like The Vex — where everyone from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers to the Chicanx band The Brat played and where Hollywood punk and East L.A. punk were able to melt into a greater punk scene — these Chicanx bands were also able to expand their influence into both existing and just emerging genres.
East L.A. punk band, The Bags, for example, are widely considered to have significantly inspired the hardcore punk movement of the 1980s. The Chicanx frontwoman, Alice Bag, would rage heavily on stage as she all-but-shrieked the lyrics to powerhouse songs like “Gluttony” and “We Don’t Need the English.” So powerful were her performances that she was nicknamed “Violence Girl” by the band’s fans and contemporaries. The band’s signature aggression lent itself directly to the punk movements to follow, establishing The Bags as luminaries in the greater punk scene, not just that of The Vex.
Chicanx punk band The Plugz, known for their innovative blend of punk mainstays and a Mexican folk sound, were also able to gain exposure far beyond the scope of Cesar Chavez Boulevard. By 1984, they had played with Bob Dylan on his inaugural The Late Show with David Letterman performance and attracted a sizable new audience that had been previously inaccessible to the Mexican American punk rockers.
The Chicanx punk movement, one rooted deeply in Latinidad, did not exist merely in the periphery of the increasingly mainstream, predominantly-white institution of punk. Instead, it both influenced and was influenced by the scene, all the while forwarding a unique legacy and providing lasting inspiration to the bands who would follow.
This past month marked my first ever time visiting L.A., which meant the historic Self Help Graphics building was a must-see. While Self Help was forced to move locations in 2007 out of economic necessity, the mosaic-sheathed building still promised to stand sparkling under the scorching L.A. sun.
Upon arriving, the venue I had only known as the vibrant centerpoint for an insurgent music scene seemed dead and desolate in comparison — a mere relic of punk mythology. (It was only later that I learned that a couple miles away, the newest iteration of Self Help Graphics was up and running in a new central-L.A. location, where it operates under the same commitment to mutual aid and community building as it did back on the corner of Cesar Chavez Boulevard.) Though buried in the past, the raw energy from the early years of The Vex still seemed to hang thick in the air like static, a reminder of what once was and what became of it.
“The most important thing that people need to know is that punk was not invented by White males, nor was it exclusively their domain,” Alice Bag said in an interview with AJ+. “Punk was created by women, people of color, and queers. And without all of us, it would be nothing.”
Indeed, without the groundbreaking musical style by iconoclastic Chicanx or Chicanx-fronted bands like The Bags, Los Illegals, and The Plugz pushing the fore of what could be accepted and listened to, the punk scene as we know it today could have been wildly different. Even beyond the United State’s borders, politically-charged punk movements like that of East L.A. — movements that were rooted in the expression and representation of Latinidad — were also inspiring punk artists in Latin America, who were starting to take up their instruments as a form of political resistance in a wave of punk that would spread throughout the ’80s and into the ’90s.

Wrapping our heads around everything going on in 2020 is an impossible feat. So maybe Kanye West’s attempt to raise the dead for a birthday present to his wife isn’t as surprising as it ordinarily would be. The gift, a hologram of Kim Kardashian’s deceased father, feels like a plot point from a Kardashian-themed “Black Mirror” episode. Again — it fits right in with 2020.
The hologram depicting Robert Kardashian, who passed away in 2003, speaks to Kim and is programmed to share many touching messages, including that she married the “most, most, most, most, most genius man in the world.”
Kim tweeted a video of the hologram’s entire message to her, along with the caption “For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime. A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad. It is so lifelike! We watched it over and over, filled with emotion.”
In addition to praising Kanye, the hologram also had thoughtful words for Kim. “You look beautiful just like when you were a little girl,” it said. “I watch over you and your sisters and brothers and the kids every day."
Social media had mixed reactions to the gift, and many mocked Kanye for the decision. Comedians such as Jenny Jafe joked about the choice, saying, “I was gonna get Robert Kardashian holograms for my family for the holidays, but now it won’t be a surprise.”
Fans reacted to the hologram with a litany of Twitter comments. They described it as “creepy” and one wrote, “2020 is the weirdest year of all time.”
Kris Jenner defended the hologram, calling Kanye “the king of gifts.” She shared that viewing the hologram with the family was “intense” and that the whole family started to cry. “It was a beautiful, beautiful moment,” she said.
Not all fans were anti-hologram — many were supportive and wanted the family to enjoy it. Reporter Nola Ojomu praised Kanye’s decision, saying, “You might not like it, but Kim and her family were always gonna love it!"
Ojumu is right — the Kardashians don’t usually let a mixed public opinion dictate their lives. They clearly loved the present.

Contrary to popular belief, Antonio Vivaldi did, indeed, compose more pieces than just “The Four Seasons.” The Italian virtuoso is actually widely considered to be one of the greatest Baroque composers of all time — a legacy which The Handel and Haydn Society (H+H) hopes to revitalize by “converting new audiences to this extraordinary music, generation after generation.”
The Venetian maestro was highlighted at “The Magic of Vivaldi,” an online concert debuted by H+H on Oct. 13, where a star-riddled string quartet accompanied by world renowned soprano Amanda Forsythe transported the audience back to the age of Baroque.
The Harvard Crimson spoke over the phone with Guy Fishman, principal cellist of H+H, on what exactly makes up that Vivaldi-esque magic and the relevance of Baroque in the context of our modern world.
The Harvard Crimson: Why expose new audiences to Vivaldi’s character?
Guy Fishman: When we’re at our best, we’re always trying to not just reach the people who already love this, but the people who are there taking a risk on a couple of hours that they’re never going to get back. We want to make those couple of hours extremely valuable and make a fan out of them.
THC: What elements did you as a quartet work to highlight in “The Magic of Vivaldi"?
GF: There are elements of the big orchestral, the impact, and there are elements that are very intimate because of the small amount of people on stage, where their individual voices are able to be heard.
THC: With performances like this being streamed, what do you as a musician hope to reach in a wider audience?
GF: It’s not about fame and success and admiration. It is about being able to continue to send the message. Classical music has been said to be dying for over a thousand years. ‘Everyone is old, no young people, the art is gonna die.’ Yet here we are, playing music from 250 years ago.
THC: Is there a particular sound or perspective you’re trying to get at with the setup of the online concert?
GF: Every performance, whether it’s live streamed or pre-produced, is definitely a time capsule of the present condition. Everybody wants more intimate content, but everyone is now producing this intimate content because we can’t do it live.
THC: As a performer, was there anything different about recording in this new environment?
GF: It’s the energy that rock bands feel when they play a stadium, when they’re connecting with all those people. That’s missing in the more immediate way. But the benefits are that if it’s pre-recorded you can polish it in a way you can’t with live recordings. And most importantly, you can reach a much much wider audience: People all over the world can watch you.
THC: What stayed the same?
GF: Ultimately, we are just going out there and trying to sing and play as best we can to give life to music we love and believe in. It doesn't matter that it was a studio, it doesn’t matter the circumstances — when we get together we are getting together for the same purpose regardless of where it is, when it is, we are getting together to make music to the best of our ability.
THC: Was there a certain goal you were trying to take on in performing for the wider general public, or someone who might have not otherwise went to the concert?
GF: To those people in the audience who may never have heard the music that we’re playing, we play as ambassadors. Ambassadors for children who are studying instruments and need support, public education, private education, college education. Ambassadors for composers of new music who you might go and listen to if you become interested in our music. Ambassadors for our organization, ambassadors for our instruments. We hope that there is someone out there who we can reach by making them as excited as we are about the music we love.

“The way we talk about Black genius always denies craft, skill, virtuosity. It is described as innate… [As if] there is no interpretation, there is no style, there is no experimentation,” Samantha Sheppard, an assistant film professor at Cornell University, said in an interview following the panel that closed the New York Film Festival.
The geniuses Sheppard refers to are James Baldwin and Muhammad Ali, the subjects of the documentaries “Meeting The Man: James Baldwin in Paris,” and “Muhammad Ali, The Greatest,” which were part of the Revivals section that concluded this year’s New York Film Festival. To celebrate the occasion, the festival’s final panel discussion, “The Artist, the Athlete, and the Revolutionary,” brought together scholars and critics to reflect on how Black celebrity functions both in the documentaries and the larger worlds of Baldwin and Ali. The discussion pushed audiences beyond simplistic questions about the responsibility of Black artists, the palatability of their work for white audiences, and how celebrity supposedly removes them from their community. Instead, the entire talk was, as Sheppard put it, “a reframe,” inviting consideration of Baldwin and Ali’s engagement with local and global communities, and the connection of both men to current struggles.
Moderated by freelance writer Nicholas Russell, the panel featured culture critic and 2020 Pulitzer Prize finalist Soraya Nadia McDonald, New School literature professor Rich Blint, and community organizer and writer Kazembe Balagun, in addition to Sheppard.
The panelists reframed two oft-asked questions. First: What is the Black artist’s responsibility to their community? Blint emphasized that this is actually a question of how far Black artists can push their public critiques of their society and still get paid. Second, with the topic of white audiences using Black artistry as a "how to" tool to try and be less racist, the panelists emphasized that the onus is not solely on the work of Black artists, but on white people themselves to work to dismantle racism. They reminded audiences that the evidence of white supremacy’s deep harms is unavoidable; there is thus no excuse for white people to avoid confronting their own roles in continuing anti-Blackness.
Throughout the discussion, the panelists connected both figures to the larger struggles of their (and our) times. The panelists used the Baldwin documentary to discuss the Black radical tradition as a fundamentally international one, and Balagun pointed out Baldwin’s relationship to the anti-colonial struggle in Algeria, as well as Ali’s refusal to fight in the Vietnam War. With the Ali documentary, they pointed to his status as a spectacular figure in the athletic canon, and McDonald emphasized the way that Black public figures like Ali (and, more contemporarily, Naomi Osaka) are labeled as “ungrateful” when they speak out against racism. The panelists noted how focused both men were on Black youth as a central part of their politics and community.
Sheppard, in a later interview, exposed larger threads of artistic craft for Baldwin and Ali. She emphasized Ali’s skill as an orator and public speaker, and his athleticism as an art form he perfected over time. She also pointed to Baldwin’s veracity as a film critic in “The Devil Finds Work,” where he was “trying to engage with Black spectatorship.” Focusing on this craft allows audiences to go beyond simply engaging with Black art as an, “instructional tool,” and instead engage with it as an “imaginative practice.”
Within the context of artistic craft, she emphasized how sometimes, Baldwin and Ali’s words were and are deradicalized in an attempt to commidify them: “[The immense visual archive of Ali and Baldwin is] used and misused and I would even say, at times, abused by various cultural industries who want to monetize a revolution into sound bites and visual vignettes that divorce it from its more radical politics.”
The Film Festival Talks co-programmers, Devika Girish and Maddie Whittle, emphasized that the talk grew out of the desire to highlight the rarely-seen Baldwin documentary, which then got paired with the more well-known Ali documentary in a drive-in screening. Girish noted that the Talks program is meant to “cross-pollinate” filmmakers across the festival, and Whittle mentioned that it was not an intentional choice to have this talk conclude the series, but that it nonetheless provided a moving finale.
“I felt like having so much brilliance in one place and us just sort of being able to gather people around and say, watch this brilliance, as a way to close the festival was really powerful for me,” Whittle said.
“It hopefully made the point that this [panel] is a discussion that encompasses the entire festival... this is not about these two films or, you know, this particular section of the program. [Centering Black voices] is what should be on all of our minds,” Girish said.
Reflecting on the panel, Sheppard said she wanted audiences to remember both the deep criticism and the potent emotion contained in these documentaries. “We left the films a lot to discuss larger concepts like celebrity,” she said. “But I just want to remind people that the films are really, really beautiful.”

This week’s installment of “The Undoing,” titled “The Missing,” takes a sharp turn from the pleasant and cozy life of the Fraser family, quickly turning into an hour of suspense and tension. As Grace Fraser’s (Nicole Kidman) life seems to unravel on screen, the intrigue and mystery surrounding the mysterious murder of Elena Alves (Matilda De Angelis) only grows, as her husband is cleared of all potential charges with a solid alibi and Jonathan Fraser (Hugh Grant) is left as the sole suspect for this high profile Upper East Side murder.
In an effective turn from the first episode, the writing takes a more sinister approach. Rather than the flaunty, enjoyable walks through Central Park we saw before, Grace and her son Henry (Noah Jupe) are now seen hustling through crowds of reporters, dodging questions about the mysterious disappearance of her husband. Grace is noticeably anxious, waiting for her husband to finally reappear and put her horrors to bed. Unfortunately, every question she asks leaves five more in its place. In a beautifully shot interaction with a hospital colleague, Grace is stuck begging — at the bottom of a flight of stairs — to be told where her husband might be. As if to say her time at the top of New York society may be at an end, a man who was once a dear friend is unwilling to speak to her at all.
This episode plays out like “The Thing” (1982); it seems as if any man with greying hair and a herringbone coat might be her disappeared husband. The constant paranoia and fear surrounding her husband’s claim to be in Cleveland only grows as Detective Joe Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) seems more and more interested in her story. The rollercoaster of stress and anxiety grips the audience. Rather than telling the audience the happenings of the Fraser family, we get to see it in all its glory through elegant, life-like conversation and clearly written scenes. In particular, we get to see Grace and her father Franklin Reinhart (Donal Sutherland) act as an elite father-daughter duo should: saving face as the press hounds Grace’s every move, all the while trying to discover the man hiding among them.
With Jonathan still out of the picture, the tension of the episode is constantly palpable. Through careful scoring and thoughtful cinematography, the audience can’t help but be as nervous as Grace is. In a particularly clear description of this mood, Grace and her son Henry are away at the family beach house and we see the briefest flash of a man’s head twice. Not being able to tell if it’s her imagination or an unknown figure lurking, Grace’s anxiety reaches fever-peaks. Again, a mystery just on the edge of her vision.
The episode reaches its climax perfectly as Grace waits in terror after another night at the beach house, hearing footsteps on the floor below. We see a figure flash across the screen, and Jonathan whispers, “Don’t scream. I didn’t kill her” For the first time in almost 90 minutes of screen time in the miniseries, Jonathan graces the screen. He looks broken. Finally the missing husband is found, even if it’s under less-than-ideal circumstances.
Although an episode long thriller can get tedious, the cinematography keeps the audience waiting with rapt attention. There’s not a moment of direct sunlight throughout the episode; it only gets darker and more hopeless, quietly reflecting Grace’s mood. In the moments before Jonathan’s reveal, it’s pitch black — the dead of night — but as he confronts her, the subtle grey of the early morning pre-dawn light begins to filter through. As if communicating only the most miniscule amount of hope, the brightening day shows that maybe the life of the Frasers isn’t quite over.
Echoing back to the first episode once more, this episode ends without answering the big question of whether the beast of the season — in our case the murderer of Elena Alves — has really been found, or whether he is simply hiding among the other characters, free from scouring eyes with the attention entirely diverted. Regardless, the third installment of “The Undoing” is sure to be exciting even if part of the suspense of the series has passed. Going into the halfway point of the series, there is still so much more to be uncovered about the Frasers' deeply hidden secrets, dangerous affairs, and future for their family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming to college, coping with eating concerns and body image issues was harder than it was in high school, but spending a long period at home after having already been at college for nearly two years was even more difficult.
For most of high school and my first year at Harvard, I had convinced myself that I was fully recovered from the eating disorder I had initially been diagnosed with as an eight-year-old. I believed mental illness was a relic of my pre-adolescence. Through hard work and support, I had escaped its grasps. However, this enticing narrative, this perfectionist’s view of recovery, has only prevented me from being honest with myself about my own emotions and behaviors, ensnaring me in a silence that COVID-19 has exacerbated.
Eating disorders are extremely arduous— and common under normal circumstances. A remote lifestyle will only increase their ubiquity.
In recent months, there has been a swath of research published about the detrimental “second pandemic,” that the COVID-19 virus is carrying with it: a pandemic of mental health challenges. A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that more than 40 percent of U.S. adults reported struggling with mental health or substance use in June 2020, with symptoms disproportionately impacting young adults.
Typically, 10 to 20 percent of college women and 4 to 10 percent of college men are expected to develop an eating disorder. The risk of developing symptoms doubles for transgender students, compared to their cisgender female peers. Given the relationship between stress and eating disorders, on top of the unique conditions generated by new pandemic lifestyles, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which eating disorder rates wouldn’t be on the rise.
During these turbulent times, there’s an ever more pressing need to foster greater awareness about eating concerns and related issues. I’m not alone — and you’re not either. When we talk candidly about what we’re going through, we can disentangle ourselves from our shared silence, becoming mutually empowered to access the supports we deserve.
“Eating disorders often arise as a person's best attempt to cope with painful, difficult feelings: anxiety, relationship difficulties, loneliness, sadness. During the pandemic we've all experienced more of these difficulties, so students who've coped through eating or not eating in the past may have noticed an increase in disordered eating behaviors during this time of disruption and isolation,” Dr. Barbara Lewis, Chief of Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services wrote in an email.
“Seeing ourselves on camera constantly as we use video platforms for daily life can also cause dissatisfaction with appearance/body image,” she added.
Never being able to escape one’s own image, alongside a heightened awareness of one’s own comportments, can be distressing for those of us already particularly conscious of how (much) we occupy space and how we look to others. Indeed, some doctors have observed that often the longer their patients spend looking at themselves on Zoom the more distorted their self-image becomes — affecting their ability to focus.
Kathryn S. “Kat” Boit ’22, a former Student Mental Health Liaison (now known as Active Minds at Harvard), seeks some semblance of privacy by speaking to me from her closet. Against a background of button-up shirts, she assures me that everything she is saying can undoubtedly be heard by her roommates. While she’s taking the semester off for mental health reasons, she counts herself as lucky to be living with friends who are aware and supportive of her borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses.
One of the biggest obstacles students face to seeking help during this virtual semester, Boit said, is a lack of the privacy needed to comfortably have conversations with a therapist, away from one’s family or roommates.
Another is a discontinuity in care. As of June, Boit’s Massachusetts-based psychiatrist was no longer able to see her: Kat recently moved to New York, and her psychiatrist doesn’t have a license to treat or prescribe there. One month ago, about to run out of medication, Boit had to email her psychiatrist and drive to a pharmacy in Massachusetts to pick up her prescription.
To combat some of these challenges, Margaret Schrier, Chief Clinical Dietician at Harvard University Health Services, highlighted the plethora of varied resources available to students, including Monday-Friday online appointments, forthcoming nutrition workshops, access to the Multi-Service Eating Disorders Association’s support groups, and Instagram pages, such as @covid19eatingsupport. CAMHS also sees students with eating concerns through triage assessments, individual therapy, workshops, and by working as collaborative treatment teams both inside and outside of HUHS.
There are inevitable limitations to delivering mental health care amid COVID-19. However, the University is clearly committed to connecting us with the support we need.
There’s a lot we can do collectively to fix the culture of competition and silence that fosters unhealthy eating in our community as well. Upon arriving at Harvard, Chloé L.M. Georgeaux-Healy ’22 experienced shock at how divisive and competitive food and exercise can be here, calling it a “really uncomfortable, dicey topic.” And yet it has often felt to her like there is not a single woman in her life who has not experienced issues with eating or body image.
Fortunately, we have the power to change these patterns and break silences that have become ritualized. “There is a silence, but the silence doesn't exist because there are not words to fill it. It just exists because there's fear and trepidation of what it means to be vulnerable with others. And I don't want to discount that. I think that is very real,” Marlena E. Skrabak ’22, a Crimson Design editor, said.
Skrabak and Georgeaux-Healy co-direct Harvard Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach.
Boit’s message is even more straightforward: “Reach out to your friends. It makes such a difference to people to just shoot them a text and say, ‘Hey, what are you doing on Saturday? Let's call.’” It’s small moments and conversations with others who are struggling that make Boit realize, if we were all just more open about our mental health, maybe we wouldn’t feel so alone.
True to Boit’s wisdom, every Monday, no matter how busy, my best friend from home and I have a 15-minute call to check in regarding how we’re both feeling about the week ahead. Taking a break from work, I walk around my Cambridge neighborhood. This brief moment of connection and reciprocal care revitalizes me, reminding me that I’m surrounded by support.
The eating disorder recovery process is about improving relationships — relationships to food and to your body. And we all know relationships require constant work.
I have tough days. We all do. Take it moment by moment. Let’s lift each other up and out of the silence.
Aysha L.J. Emmerson ’22, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a special concentrator in Resilience Studies in Kirkland House. Her column appears on alternate Mondays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although I had studied at Widener Library in my days as a student at Harvard, I admit I had not searched for magazines or books published in the Uighur language. But this winter, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit our country, I finally did. I visited Widener in search of the first modern Uighur translation of “Qutadğu Bilig,” or “Wisdom of Royal Glory,” an 11th century work written by Yūsuf Khass Hajib Balasaguni for the prince of Kashgar, an ancient city where I was also born.
As someone who studied Economics, I was curious about the economic ideas of our ancestors who had lived one thousand years ago, and I hoped to find the seeds of those ideas in “Qutadğu Bilig.” At Widener, I did find the book — along with many Uighur books and magazines, such as “Tarim” and “Tangritagh.” I had not realized there would be several renowned Uighur literature magazines with almost full series at Harvard. Like one who can easily recognize his own footprints from the roads he has previously walked, after seeing those familiar works, I started to read them.
What made me shed tears was coming across several of my own poems and prose published in these magazines. I had written them before I moved to the United States in 1997, but I had not kept copies, believing mistakenly I would have access to them forever.
Flipping through page after page of Uighur literature, I felt as if I was reconnecting with a long-lost friend. Yet I was also struggling to reconcile the reality that Uighurs face today with the relatively good old days of the 1980s and early 1990s, when the Uighur language was flourishing and young Uighurs like me were hopeful about their future.
What is in danger in today’s China is not just the Uighur language itself but the existence and future of the Uighur people. Perhaps no one is suffering as severely as the Uighurs in the contemporary world. Since 2017, the Chinese government has placed hundreds of thousands — likely even more than 1.5 million — Uighur, Kazakh, and other Muslim minorities in internment camps. Often these people are subjected to forced labor or separation from their families. Due to the Chinese government’s heinous policies in violation of international norms and rules, an ethnic group that contributed significantly to the ancient Silk Road economy and enriched Central Asian civilization for more than a millennium is not only progressing, but regressing in the 21st century.
I have written before about my people and the dire situation they are facing. But nothing on the ground has improved for them at all. Thousands of Uighur scholars like Rahile Dawut and Yalqun Rozi; young Uighur entrepreneurs like Ekpar Asat; and Uighur publishing executives have not been released from their detainments yet.
At this moment, when it is impossible to receive Uighur books or magazines from Urumqi and Uighurs abroad are unable to contact loved ones, I, a Harvardian of Uighur origin, find some comfort from what Harvard has done for my people. Last year, when I met with Professor Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s Vice Provost of International Affairs, I was heartened to hear that Harvard hired a full-time Preceptor in the Uighur language. This March, when I found those Uighur literature magazines, even some containing my own poems, in the Harvard libraries, I felt very grateful for the people at Harvard who chose to acquire and maintain these works for so many years. They are not just storing Uighur magazines in the Harvard libraries, but contributing to the preservation of a history, a language and a people who are struggling to live as who they are.
Actions like these speak louder than words. Uighurs have a proverb saying “The bird that has not experienced the winter, never appreciates the spring.” Despite international condemnation, the winter for the Uighurs is not over yet. What is most worrisome and disgusting is that China seems ready to continue its oppressive policy against these innocent ethnic groups for years to come. It is relatively easy for the world community to say that it respects China’s desire to develop but cannot condone its crime against innocent ethnic groups. Yet real support, however small, for vulnerable people is always greater than lofty but empty words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A couple of weeks ago, University President Lawrence S. Bacow convened a committee to articulate “general principles” for renaming spaces, programs, and professorships that are connected to “abhorrent” activities at Harvard.
At a base level, we are pleased that President Bacow has taken this necessary and overdue step. Yet, for now, it raises a set of compelling philosophical and procedural questions: What should we rename? And how will we know?
The starting point should be obvious. While the University has numerous stains on its long history, slavery and scientific racism remain the tip of the abhorrence iceberg — from the slave trader who helped found our law school, to Harvard’s ownership of daguerreotypes portraying enslaved individuals. Names affiliated with white supremacy and its atrocities should be the first to go.
But what about the rest? Beyond that particular group, student perspectives become crucial. How should a queer student feel about living in Greenough Hall or Lowell House, knowing that they owe their names to the perpetrators of a homophobic witchhunt that resulted in a student suicide? Or Black, Jewish, and immigrant students sorted into Lowell, named after a man who sought to solve the “Jewish problem” at Harvard by implementing a quota, banned Black students from living in Harvard Yard, and supported harsh restrictions on immigration due to his views of genetic racial differences. What about having to visit the Sackler Building after having lost a close relative or friend to the opioid epidemic?
The weight given to these perspectives will vary — sometimes they will warrant a name change and sometimes they will fall short. Yet listening to these perspectives should be a critical component in deciding when or what to rename, and it is important that there is cooperation between administrators and students. There should be some kind of institutional pathway that does not put the onus of reminding the University of the questionable parts of its history entirely on students, but one that respects students’ inputs.
A petition model could fit this purpose: If a certain amount of student signatures is received by a petition, then a renaming committee assembled from the community would convene to hold a hearing on the name at hand. The person whose name is in consideration must be assessed on the entirety of their work, beliefs, and character. There is a space for complicated figures from our past if their contributions are properly contextualized. However, there will also be those who, even when placed in context, stand as emblems and figureheads of the suffering and cruelty endured by others, particularly those in marginalized groups.
For these people, there should be no space on Harvard’s campus: no name plaques, no endowed professorships, no honors. Tradition and cherished memories alone can’t be enough to outweigh the degradation of human life that is perpetrated by certain donors or honorees.
Forgetting our past — pretending that our institution always lived up to basic moral standards — is not how we make our campus a more inclusive, supportive, and intellectually rigorous environment. The University has to dig into its history and prepare to take action accordingly.
To be sure, digging for past grievances, without taking concrete steps to remedy that history, could actively create harm now — it reminds our student body that our funny-sounding halls frequently honor individuals who denied the core humanity of those who occupy them now and that our campus’ embrace of diversity is an upsettingly recent phenomenon. So we must be judicious about how we dig.
What’s more, we can’t merely apply this scrutiny merely to the past. Sackler, for example, is not an old building name (1985), nor is Chan a particularly old name for the public health school (2014). The University is making these choices in the present, and any oversight we apply to the past needs to also be geared toward how the University makes decisions going forward.
And, of course, there’s always room to think bigger. With so many buildings named after so many questionable figures, why not consider a building — a museum maybe — dedicated to the study and commemoration of the complexity and darkness of Harvard’s history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council passed legislation calling for the publication of its UC Student Survey, the formation of a food collection program, and the establishment of a racial inclusivity and advocacy week at its weekly meeting Sunday evening.
Council members spent most of Sunday’s meeting discussing “An Act to Publicize the Report on Harvard’s Spring Reopening.”
The report, which seven Council members authored, is titled “Harvard at Risk: Students Struggle in an Age of Pandemic.” It covers the results of a Council questionnaire, which 669 undergraduates completed, surveying College students’ experience of the remote semester and their preferences for the spring. The sponsors wrote they hope to publish it by Wednesday, Nov. 11.
Quincy House representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22 said much of the feedback contained within the survey results revolved around the need to improve campus life.
“It was the lowest-rated thing of 40 things that we asked undergrads to rate from,” Cheng said.
Cheng noted that students living on campus felt adhering to Harvard’s social distancing guidelines was nearly impossible. They reported that the “austere” guidelines made students less willing to tell the truth to contact tracers. Some students even said they paid other students to take tests for them.
The Council’s legislation for the survey will advocate for a “harm-reduction” approach for Spring 2021. This approach calls for Harvard to facilitate some on-campus low-risk socialization and allow the reopening of more indoor spaces, such as libraries and practice rooms.
Cheng added that the writers of the legislation referenced an open letter signed by 100 public health experts endorsing that approach, which would enable Harvard to facilitate more low-risk social interaction.
Elm Yard representative Emmy M. Cho ’24, a Crimson News comper, added that the Council did not intend the recommendations to pose any risk to staff or non-undergraduates on campus.
“Students feel as though because the rules are so strict on campus, their one way of socializing is going out to the city,” she said.
Additional recommendations from the report included increased support for students struggling with mental health and students in alternate time zones and international students, particularly freshmen. The Council members also proposed an increase in the semester stipend for students on financial aid.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
The second piece of legislation from Sunday’s meeting allocated $300 for five food collection bins, which will be placed in Annenberg Hall, Widener Library, Lowell House, Dunster House, and the Radcliffe Quadrangle. The bins will aim to reduce the College’s food waste.
Sponsors for a final piece of legislation, “An Act to Establish UC Racial Inclusivity & Advocacy Week,” asked that the Council fund a collaboration with the Harvard College Events Board to host events, citing “a need for increased spaces for inclusion and belonging in the Harvard community.”
The sponsors intend to hold the proposed Racial Inclusivity and Advocacy Week in mid-March to coincide with the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on March 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mayor of Atlanta Keisha L. Bottoms discussed how her city has handled challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the latest installment of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Voices in Leadership series Monday.
Voices in Leadership is a series aimed at connecting scientists and policymakers to brainstorm solutions for public health issues. Mary Bassett, Director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights and HSPH Professor, moderated the event.
Bottoms, the 60th mayor of Atlanta, has also served as a judge and City Councilmember in the city, and is the first mayor to serve in all three branches of its municipal government.
As in many major U.S. cities, while Atlanta initially saw declining COVID-19 case numbers a few months ago, the tally has begun slowly ticking up again.
Bassett commended Bottoms’s response to the surge, adding that the mayor has approached the pandemic response as an “opportunity to rebuild and strengthen public trust in government.” Bassett contrasted that leadership choice to the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which she called “haphazard.”
“We’ve squandered a lot of public trust,” Bassett added.
Bottoms discussed a number of programs Atlanta has implemented to ease the pressure the pandemic has placed on residents. The city created funds for small businesses, suspended evictions and water payments, delivered food to students, and gave hazard pay to essential workers at the beginning of the pandemic. Unlike some other municipalities, the city was able to repurpose many of its own workers and avoid layoffs due to the pandemic, Bottoms said.
The city also provided homeless individuals space to quarantine at local hotels and information about the pandemic. Additionally, to reduce COVID-19 cases in Atlanta’s incarcerated and detained populations, Bottoms severed the city’s relationship with ICE and eliminated cash bail bonds, reducing the number of inmates in the city jail to 30 a night.
“We did every single thing that we could think of that would help soften the blow, but there's still so much more to be done,” she said.
Bottoms said the pandemic has shown the city the importance of addressing systemic health challenges which disproportionately impact communities of color, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
“Unless we address those systemic issues — today, it may be COVID-19, and tomorrow, it may be something else.”
“You owe an obligation to your communities to address these issues,” she added.
Eric R. Andersen, who directs the Senior Leadership Fellows Program & Voices in Leadership at HSPH, wrote in an email that Bottoms is “a model of an effective leader” and “exactly the kind of person we want to highlight in the Voices in Leadership series.”
“Leadership in public health is about taking the science and translating it into steps to make lives better,” Andersen wrote. “That’s what we try to present in Voices in Leadership for our students — future leaders in public health — an opportunity to learn from leaders like Mayor Bottoms and to forge and build bridges for our scientists, researchers and faculty to connect with those at the forefront of making decisions.”
“The twin crises of the pandemic and its exposure of the fault lines in our society, from racial and economic injustice, is exactly why this handshake between science and policy is needed,” he wrote.

The Dean of Students Office has commissioned affiliates at the Harvard Graduate School of Education to produce a report on the comp process at the College, according to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair in a Oct. 30 Committee on Student Life meeting.
During the Oct. 30 meeting, O’Dair introduced CSL members to Richard J. Light — a professor at the Graduate School of Education — and his team of graduate students. Over the coming weeks, the group will conduct interviews with College students and produce findings and recommendations to O’Dair and Assistant Dean Kate T. Colleran.
“Over the past years, the issue of comping has come up in one way or another – through the UC, student engagement, or via our discussions,” O’Dair wrote in an email to The Crimson. “This is a complex issue and there is no one experience that students have. Some dislike it, others see benefits. It has been identified as a contributing factor to students experiencing a sense of belonging, especially as they first join our community.”
Alexa C. Jordan ’22, who serves as a student-member on CSL, said she hopes the findings from the report will improve students' quality of life.
“The CSL has been interested in the uniqueness and potential negative impact comping may have on students’ quality of life,” Jordan said.
“Do I think that sometimes the comp process can negatively impact freshman experience? Absolutely,” she added. “Comps have its downfalls and benefits. The question is, do the benefits outweigh the costs?”
Light wrote in an email that he hopes to present the group’s findings to O’Dair and Colleran by the end of next week. He added that though his specific “clients” are O’Dair and Colleran, he anticipates presenting the report to the CSL should O’Dair request it.
“My students plan to share many results, and also to make some recommendations,” he wrote. “The recommendations haven’t been developed yet.”
O’Dair also touted the benefits of the HGSE team’s independence, and wrote that utilizing a group of graduate students will produce a high level of academic thoroughness.
“In general, the advantages of having an academic course look at an issue of importance for the CSL is that they are able to look at the problem from a research standpoint – identify the problem, benchmark good practices, conduct literature review, collect other evidence and make conclusions,” she wrote.
Jordan also said she appreciated how the report was being compiled by an entity independent of student groups.
“I think what's so striking about this report is they don't have any direct interest,” she said. “I was really struck by their methodology. They're doing lots and lots of interviews, they're comparing to other institutions, which I think will be really useful of course. Harvard is a unique place, but we want to make sure that our uniqueness does not hurt students.”
O’Dair also noted that if the CSL takes the report under consideration, their role would be limited to advising the College on any recommended courses of action.
“The CSL is advisory in nature, so depending on what they recommend, we might discuss and suggest to a dean or deans the adoption of the recommendations,” she wrote.

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, have created a new artificial intelligence-based tool for predicting the prognosis of potential COVID-19 patients.
Led by Harvard Medical School professors Michael B. Westover, Gregory K. Robbins, and Shibani S. Mukerji, the team designed and implemented a machine learning model based on outpatient data from the respiratory illness clinics and emergency department at Mass General. Their findings were published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a peer-reviewed publication, on Oct. 24.
The model, COVID-19 Acuity Score, outputs a figure which care providers can use to determine whether an individual patient has a high chance of developing complications that would require hospitalization or time in an intensive care unit.
The data used to train the model came from 9,381 adult outpatients seen between March 7 and May 2, and the researchers used data from another 2,205 patients seen between May 3 and May 14 as a prospective validation group.
The validation group, which consists of patients in each of the model’s four output categories — hospitalization, critical illness, death, and no hospitalization — is key to evaluating the model’s performance, according to Haoqi Sun, a Medical School neurology instructor and the study’s first author.
“We really want to look into the future to make sure that model is robust for future data and future patients,” Sun said.
This large patient sample for training and validation also distinguishes the tool, according to Mukerji. She said many other models use data from as few as 200 patients.
“It really matters because you have to have a wide variety of individuals coming through because COVID itself is heterogeneous,” Mukerji said. “People's background histories are heterogeneous and so if you don't have that modeled within some sort of learning, then you're just learning on small datasets.”
The project began near the very start of the pandemic, when clinicians across the world, including those at Massachusetts General Hospital, faced an entirely unfamiliar respiratory virus with unknown risk factors.
“The basic problem was very simple,” Mukerji said. “We were starting to see patients in an outpatient setting, where the clinical providers did not know whether or not that person was going to be at risk, in a couple of days time, to go to the hospital.”
As the pandemic progressed and Boston suffered from a first wave in late April and early May, non-primary care and infectious disease physicians began staffing the emergency clinics due to the influx of potential COVID-19 patients, Mukerji said.
“They're different providers, like neurologists, who may not really see a lot of respiratory viral patients and never know when to pull the trigger to go to the hospital,” Mukerji said. “You have a problem on the back end, providers providing patients with their results, and trying to figure out, do I send them to the hospital — and our hospitals are getting full — who's the right person to send it?”
“Wouldn't it be nice if there were something that we could use to help stratify individuals? Can we use some other tool to help our clinical guidance, you know, help our clinical gut to say this person is at risk,” she added.
By focusing on outpatients, Sun said the model does not require lab test values, making it applicable in settings with walk-in patients like urgent care or emergency departments.
“There are many inpatient models which utilize these lab values,” Sun said. “They have very good predictions, very accurate predictions, but this is not usually available.”
Mukerji also said using data from hospitalized patients only fails to accurately reflect the situation in clinics and emergency departments, where many patients may not need to be hospitalized.
“This is now taking a step back and saying, ‘You know what, as an outpatient provider, I don't know if the person in front of me should be hospitalized. Should I hospitalize them? Am I scared enough?’” Mukerji said. “ There's so much unknown and so, you don't want to be sending everybody to the emergency room.

Musicians and academics discussed the role of music in fostering interpersonal connections, growth, and healing at a webinar hosted by the Harvard Business School Monday afternoon.
Following a recorded music performance, conductor and Business School case researcher John J. Masko, musician and Medical School professor Lisa M. Wong ’79, and Kennedy School professor Arthur C. Brooks reflected on the benefits of music in a discussion moderated by Business School Campus Activation Program Director Madeline Meehan.
Masko, who founded the National Virtual Medical Orchestra this year, opened the event with a recording of a remote performance by the orchestra. He said that he founded the group — which is composed of 75 medical professionals representing more than 20 states – to help individuals decompress and connect during the pandemic.
“I started hearing almost immediately from musicians in our orchestra who felt that they needed to get back to playing at what was for many of them the most stressful point in their professional lives,” Masko said.
Wong, who is a pediatrician, said studies have demonstrated the importance of music in promoting empathy and human connection.
“We know from the neuroscientists that there is not a single center of music in your brain,” Wong said. “Rather, music just infuses the entire brain.”
She added that music engages deeper parts of the brain responsible for “feeling in community with the people we’re playing with.”
Wong, who has been a member of the Boston area Longwood Symphony Orchestra for the past 35 years, highlighted music’s applications to public service. She said a concert in 1991 compelled the orchestra — which is composed of medical professionals — to turn to service because the vulnerable populations they had designed the performance for, including homeless individuals and victims of domestic violence, were unable to attend due to curfews and other restrictions.
“It was those empty seats that transformed the orchestra and taught us that we really need to be using every concert to serve, and that’s what we have done ever since,” she said.
Brooks said in an interview preceding the event that music can help individuals achieve a deeper understanding of happiness and growth.
“Happiness and unhappiness, purpose, meaning, suffering, and weakness — these are all universal experiences that people have,” he said. “When you find new ways of talking about them beyond the conventional ways — studies and data — you can reach people.”
During the webinar, Brooks described that dealing with adversity promotes personal growth. He drew an example from the life of Beethoven, whose deafness initially posed a threat to his musical career, but eventually gave rise to his unique composition style.
“He could no longer hear performances of Mozart — he just wrote what was in his imagination,” Brooks said. “And that transformed Beethoven’s work.”
Brooks said that, similarly, the current difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to developments that will strengthen humanity in the future.
“Many of the innovations that are going to save lives, many of the innovations that are going to make your life easier, they’re going to draw you together more in loving relationships with other people,” Brooks said. “They will come about because of the pain and loss that we’re suffering right now.”

Cookies, a cannabis store, was given the green light to come to Cambridge in September, but some residents are unhappy about the visibility of the real estate the dispensary will occupy in Harvard Square.
In a Sep. 24 letter to city officials and the Cambridge community, The Charles Hotel, Harvard Square Business Association, Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, The Winthrop Eliot Condominium Trust, and The Winthrop Park Trust expressed their opposition to the proposed location of the Cookies store, arguing that the location will increase cannabis use in Winthrop Park.
Cookies is set to occupy the former Staples store space at 57 JFK St. in the Crimson Galeria. In an open letter released in September, Galeria owner Raj K. Dhanda wrote that Cookies will be a “great community partner” for Cambridge.
In 2017, Dhanda sued Healthy Pharms Inc., a Massachusetts based marijunaa distributor, for attempting to open a medical marijuana dispensary on Winthrop Street. At the time, Dhanda said his businesses had been “substantially injured by a conspiracy to sell marijuana.”
The lawsuit has since been settled, and in his September letter Dhanda wrote that “prior views [he] had on many aspects of the industry were misinformed.”
His letter noted that when he realized that very few licenses had been awarded to economic empowerment applicants across Massachusetts, Dhanda decided to support Cookies.
“I knew there was an opportunity to give back to the community, to promote minority entrepreneurship, and to do something bigger than just filling another space,” Dhanda’s letter reads.
Economic empowerment applicants are businesses that receive marijuana licenses from the state through a program that intends to help groups disproportionately impacted by past drug policies.
In September 2019, the Cambridge City Council passed a moratorium giving economic empowerment applicants a two-year window to be the sole operators of recreational marijuana shops in the city. The moratorium was initially lifted in a Middlesex Superior Court. In April, however, an appeals court judge sided with Cambridge and overturned the Superior Court’s decision.
When Cookies Cambridge opens, it will be the first economic empowerment applicant to benefit from the moratorium in Cambridge.
Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said supporting economic empowerment applicants is “an opportunity to do some justice here” during an interview with The Crimson on Friday.
“It's a clear matter of justice when the War on Drugs has really harmed communities of color for four decades now, and that includes Cambridge,” he said.
Still, a coalition of local Harvard Square residents, businesses owners, and organizations have said the proposed location is inappropriate for any dispensary.
Signatories of the Sep. 24 letter wrote that Cookies will have a negative impact on the surrounding area because Winthrop Park will become a “landing spot” for Cookies customers.
“At worst, even despite increased security and policing, the Park will become a place where individuals consume their Cookies products after exiting the facility,” the letter reads.
“Families with young children, individuals with respiratory illnesses, the elderly, and many others who do not wish to be exposed to cannabis will be deterred from using a Park that was once so welcoming to all,” it continues.
Damond Hughes, owner and operator of minority-owned Blue Enterprises and Cookies Cambridge, responded to these comments in a letter released Oct. 22.
“To presume that the clientele of our Black-owned and operated business will require additional policing and that they are not capable of following the law by consuming their purchases in private residences are further examples of prejudicial and racist assumptions on the part of the [economic empowerment] opponents,” he wrote.
Hughes said adults cannot legally consume cannabis anywhere in the Commonwealth except on private, residential property. He also added that Cookies will not be the first marijuana dispensary to open near a public park in the city.
“To assume that the patrons of a Black-owned store will not be able to self-regulate or be law-abiding in the consumption of its products — versus the patrons of other previously approved white-owned dispensaries in proximity to public spaces — presents itself as inherently racist and biased,” Hughes wrote.
HSBA, HSNA, and the Winthrop Park Trust rejected Hughes’s criticisms in a letter released Oct. 27.
The organizations wrote that the term “economic empowerment opponents” was misleading as their groups had repeatedly expressed strong support for the program.
“We support economic empowerment and have done so publicly. What we do not support is a recreational marijuana shop located at 57 JFK Street,” the letter reads. “The 45-foot proximity to a family park is particularly problematic given Cookies’ children-friendly, cartoon-laden product marketing (even the name Cookies stems from its flagship product, ‘Girl Scout Cookies’).”
In their Sept. 24 letter, signatories had also expressed concern over the floor to ceiling windows at 57 JFK Street, which they wrote could become a “massive billboard for cannabis use” to those in the park.
In his response, Hughes explained that the store’s products would not be displayed in the window or visible to minors, and that the letter “C” would replace “Cookies” on the store’s signage.
Zondervan said he supported Cookies despite opposition during Friday’s interview.
“There's this great unfounded fear that people are gonna walk in the store, buy cannabis and walk across the street and smoke in the park, that's just not the case,” he added.
Zondervan also said that zoning laws passed by the council allow Cookies to open in the Square, despite concerns raised regarding the store’s proximity to the park.
“The zoning that we passed is very clear as to where these stores are and are not allowed to locate, and this store is in the business district,” he said. “There's no legitimate reason to prevent that from opening.”

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s transition team named an advisory board of 13 public health and scientific experts on Monday to advise the next administration’s COVID-19 response.
“Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most important battles our administration will face, and I will be informed by science and by experts,” Biden said in the press release. “The advisory board will help shape my approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations.”
The committee will be co-chaired by former Food and Drug Administration commissioner David A. Kessler, Yale University Associate Dean for Health Equity Research Marcella Nunez-Smith, and former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy ’98.
Kessler, a Harvard Medical School alumnus, served as FDA commissioner under George W. Bush and William J. Clinton and was the dean of two schools of public health.
Nunez-Smith, who completed her residency training at Harvard Medical School-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said she and the rest of the board would focus on recovery for all Americans, including communities of color facing a “disproportionate” burden.
"Our country is facing an unprecedented time with COVID-19 cases accelerating nationwide. Everyone is affected by this pandemic, yet the burden is disproportionate. We know communities of color are grieving at high rates and are facing substantial economic impact,” Nunez-Smith wrote in an emailed statement. “The transition advisory board is setting a course for everyone in our country to experience recovery.”
Murthy was an attending physician and instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital before his confirmation as surgeon general during Barack Obama’s second term.
The board also includes Rick A. Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Bright was ousted from his role after he filed a whistleblower complaint against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services alleging his early warnings about the pandemic were ignored by the Trump administration.
Harvard Medical School and School of Public Health Professor Atul A. Gawande, a Medical School alumnus who was also tapped for the committee, wrote in a statement that he believes the virus can be contained, despite the current “runaway spread.”
"We have runaway spread right now,” Gawande wrote. “But I am confident we can get the virus under control, save lives and livelihoods, and bring people back together again.”
Other committee members with Harvard ties include Medical School alumni Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former Obama administration health policy advisor, and Robert M. Rodriguez, professor of emergency medicine at University of California at San Francisco. Celine R. Gounder, an assistant professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, completed her residency training in internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, the Medical School's largest teaching hospital.
Biden’s advisory board also includes former assistant FDA commissioner Luciana Borio, former Chicago public health commissioner Julie Morita, Executive Director of the Global Health Council Loyce Pace, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota Michael T. Osterholm, and former U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Eric P. Goosby.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a normal year, first-year student-athletes must find a balance between academics and athletics. And while this year is different in many ways, first-year athletes are not taking this period of uncertainty as time off from training even as their competitions have been canceled. You might find some on-campus student-athletes running along the Charles, waiting for their team’s designated time slot to lift in Harvard’s athletic facilities, or following Google docs with workouts prepared by their coaches.
Not all first-year students were allowed back on campus this semester, however. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement division had made the decision to revoke a previously established directive that prohibited enrolled international students from staying in the U.S. this academic year if all their classes are remote. Nonetheless, this policy reversal did not apply to incoming international students, who required an F-1 sponsorship, and as Harvard’s 2020-21 course instruction is fully remote, first-year international students were prevented from coming to Cambridge.
Many of those incoming international students were recruited athletes hailing from around the world.
“I was kind of expecting it. I wasn’t that surprised—I was sad, but I knew it was coming,” said first-year Alex Smits, who hails from Sydney, Australia.
Smits was set to begin her first year on the women’s heavyweight crew team. She now finds herself juggling between training, school work, and balancing the time zone difference.
“My first class at the beginning of the semester was at 5 a.m., and that was three days a week. But we’ve had daylight savings, so all of my classes moved up one hour, so then they started at 6 a.m. Now they will move up to 7 A.M, which has actually been really helpful.” Smits said. “At the beginning, I was okay with the 5 a.m classes because rowing starts early as well, so on a normal day I would be getting up early anyways.”
Dany Zapata Rincon, who was born in Colombia but grew up in Sydney, Australia, is a first-year on the women’s water polo team. Rincon, too, has faced difficulty in planning class times due to the time zone difference.
“I managed to get all my classes in the morning, but it was a bit upsetting because some of the classes I wanted to take were in the middle of the night,” Rincon said. “I kind of had to choose my classes based on how appropriate the times would be for me.”
On top of training and schoolwork, first-year international students are also missing out on the social aspect that only an on-campus experience could provide.
“Say I wanted to study and do one class in a café and walk back to the dorms, I could walk with someone and chat on the way,” Rincon said. “If I want to do it on Zoom, I have to allocate a whole hour or thirty minutes just to talk to someone. You don’t get those little 10-15 minute breaks, and it kind of adds up on your time. It's been hard.”
Martin Kulesza, a first-year on the men’s heavyweight crew team from Melbourne, Australia, dealt with the same issue when choosing his classes.
“There were certain classes that I wanted to take, but I couldn’t, due to the fact that I didn’t want to manage classes at pretty ridiculous hours and whatnot,” Kulesza said. “As for some classes I had to forgo and not end up doing and save them for a later semester, probably when I’m on campus.”
Kulesza not only had to take the time zone difference into consideration when choosing classes, but also the time he would be spending training on the water.
“It just makes it hard for picking classes and stuff like that because it gives me a very limited choice in what I want to do,” Kulesza said. “I'll use expos for an example. I think there were 30 or 40 expos topics of interest, but my choices were shortened down to five because of the time zone difference. All the other ones occurred between around 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., which I can’t really have considering I'm on water most days at 5:45 a.m.”
Despite the difficulty in choosing classes, all three athletes have maintained their training and determination to keep fit for a future season. The NCAA made the decision to loosen rules regarding outside competition, making it possible for athletes to be a part of a club and compete on a team. Smits is a member of her state’s rowing team and has already participated in a few regattas.
“I think if I wasn’t able to race, I would have been so much less motivated to row. I feel like if you don’t have a goal, you are just like training for nothing,” Smits said. “It's a pretty good program, and I’m confident that once I get onto campus, eventually, I’ll be prepared.”
Due to restrictions on spectators, her regattas are recorded and live-streamed on Youtube.
“Normally I send the link to my parents, and they can watch it on their laptops at home, which is nice.”
Similarly, Kulesza has kept up with rowing. The odd hours of class time, however, have made it difficult to schedule time on the water.
“At the moment, I’m having to miss certain training sessions to accommodate having classes at midnight and whatnot,” Kulesza said. “I can’t train as much as I'd like to, or train as much as I really need to be in order for me to try and make a high-level team later in the year.”
Amidst the strain in taking on their first year at Harvard remotely, these athletes have used the void of being on campus to turn their attention towards competing for Australia’s state and national teams.
Smits hopes to try out for the national team, something she would not be able to do if she were on campus this year.
“If I can’t get on campus next semester, it's nice that there is at least something here for me,” Smits said. “Obviously it's not the same, but that's the way that I have thought about it. If I can’t go there, then at least I can do these things and have the opportunity to do that.”
Kulesza is determined to try out for a national team if he stays in Melbourne.
“I've kind of made up the decision that if I have the option to stay here, I'd definitely stay back in Melbourne and go for any team that I can here.”
These three athletes remain resilient in not only their commitment to preparing for an upcoming season in Cambridge but also in the way that they have adapted to a less than ideal first year in college.
“It leads to growth, right?” Rincon said. “I'll have learned a lot of different skills because of this, and I am not the only one. You do the best you can I guess.”
