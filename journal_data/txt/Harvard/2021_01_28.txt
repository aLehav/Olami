After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to think that I was good at standing in lines — I waited my turn, moved in step with the person ahead of me, and knew exactly the right smile to flash at anyone I bumped with my backpack.
Early lockdown rendered such day-to-day skills useless. I fell out of practice. Now, I have to pause, breathe, and prepare myself for the mega-lines outside groceries and pharmacies. When crowds were forbidden in a city where crowds are the norm, lines grew long; line-waiters grew impatient and, somehow, I got lonelier. The mandated six feet of distance obstructed any connections I had once found with row mates and backpack targets. Bored, I tried and failed to make up for those losses with eavesdropping (and I wasn’t the only one).
When the first non-trial participant received a Covid-19 vaccine dose in New York, Americans in every state joined what I hope will be our final pandemic line: the line for vaccinations.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has provided federal, state, and local authorities with guidance on structuring that line. According to these rules, programs should prioritize doses to ensure the most equitable and effective vaccination campaign.
I know where I fit into those ACIP recommendations. In fact, I know the spots of my parents, grandparents, and friends as well. I think we’ve all made our own guesses on when exactly our loved ones could be vaccinated. When the strain and routine of Covid-life threaten to crush me, I recite my imagined lineup as a kind of poem: January for Granny; April for Dad; August for me.
All three of us, even myself way down there at the end, will be among the first recipients in the longer global line. People around the world await these vaccines; there are front line and essential workers in every country who, unlike me, cannot limit their exposure. Now that my world feels so reduced to familial worries, and the end of the line inches towards us far slower than I would like, I mind that privilege. I sit grateful for the speed at which the vaccine line was fashioned for us, and I wait.
Some will not. Leading industries can lobby state health departments to prioritize their employees among “essential workers.” The rich, famous, and well-connected can pressure private healthcare services for vaccine appointments far before those slots become publicly available. Merchants, physicians, and pharmaceutical chains can divert vials from their intended locations. Privileged Americans will always find ways to jump a line.
In the last year of elementary school I waited in a very different line (this was way back when my skill at standing in packed queues was still useful). I was class leader and first in the lunch line behind these much older girls. I remember the moment that the stairwell door opened, and another gaggle of older girls, friends of the ones originally there, cut everyone in the group I was supposed to lead. No one in my class said anything, but we vowed later never to do the same until, well, we got older, and did.
Everyone has their own version of that story; it’s a coming-of-age classic. Once I became a middle schooler myself and my elementary school sister complained about cutting and spot-saving in the lunch line, I would tell her (with all the wisdom three years can bring) that I had quietly waited in line, and so now I could cut. She would have to do the same. And until then, shut up about it!
We cannot shut up now. The pandemic has taken an incalculable toll on our country and will leave incomprehensible suffering in its wake. I have numbed myself to the costs we can quantify — in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths — and that apathy terrifies me. Behind those statistics are people who should be standing, shoulder to shoulder, in line with us.
It is for those we have lost and might lose that we must wait our turn in line — and we must do so in good faith, masked, six feet apart, with sanitizer in hand. It is for them too that we must demand a rapid vaccination campaign that protects the vulnerable, at-risk, and general public.
Most Harvard students have months until their assigned vaccination slots, but I predict that many will have a chance to jump the line before then. Cutting may feel like no big deal. After all, we have survived lunch lines — and in doing so, we learned to keep quiet behind some line-cutters and then skip the line ourselves. The consequences of doing either now would be severe. From reinforcing the inequities exposed each day by the devastating and disproportionate loss of life among racial and ethnic minorities; to undermining already cautious faith in the ethical distribution of resources; to imperiling our vaccination strategy and public health.
Every dose administered to a line-cutter means one less available to those who waited their turn. Harvard students, wait yours too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is an excess of Crimson in the White House. The incoming administration has packed its staff with Harvard affiliates, naming at least 63 university-connected individuals to a variety of governmental roles. Pending Senate confirmation, four former contributors to this very paper will hold cabinet positions, including the much-coveted Attorney General and Secretary of State posts. These leaders, along with six of their colleagues, boost Harvard’s presence in Biden's Cabinet to ten officials: the upshot being that Harvard affiliates make up a staggering 40 percent of President Joe Biden’s proposed innermost circle.
Biden's selections are perfectly understandable — a relief, even. They represent a welcome change from the previous administration, a clear embrace of expertise over bloodline. Yet as we celebrate the rise to prominence of our well-deserving and accomplished affiliates, we should also recognize the faults of a system that grants such immense influence to a single institution – even if that institution happens to be our own.
Our nation is frequently billed as a meritocracy. Accessing wealth and power, we’re told, is a matter of determination and persistence; a Harvard affiliation, it’s purported, is proof of extraordinary skill. Perhaps former President Barack Obama (yet another Harvard graduate) summarized this sentiment best when he declared, "Here in America, you can make it if you try."
But reality falls short of such cherished myths. A connection to our University — or to any of our peer institutions — does signal a high level of expertise, not least because of its world-class research centers and facilities. But it hardly ensures a range of abilities so exceptional and unmatched by the rest of the population to warrant our grotesque overrepresentation at the top of the political sphere.
For one, Harvard doesn't have a monopoly on brilliance. Every year, Harvard College — from which 27 of Biden's appointees graduated — rejects tens of thousands of extraordinarily bright, hyper-qualified young applicants. Most of them are extremely passionate, slightly unlucky individuals whose careers have arbitrarily been slighted before they have even begun.
Beyond the sheer luck factor, there's also the fact that Harvard College admissions can unduly benefit specific demographic groups — particularly those who are white, affluent, and well-connected. Harvard’s preference for admitting the children of donors (Dean's List admissions), legacies, and athletes skilled in niche, costly sports exemplifies this fact, but some of our most basic selection criteria are similarly corrupted. The SAT, partly because of the rise of expensive private tutoring, is infamously correlated with family income. We also welcome more students from certain prestigious high schools than from entire countries each year, and recently had a class year filled with as many students from the nation's top 0.1 percent of earners as from households in the bottom 20 percent. Clearly, our system reflects access just as much as it does intellectual prowess.
So coming from an affluent, well-connected background can ease your access to Harvard, which in turn will enhance your ability to access wealth and power. We know this much — in fact, we benefit from the trend: Every member of this Editorial Board chose to attend this school, at least in part, because of the abundance of opportunities made available by its impeccable reputation. But the fact that we benefit from the system doesn't render it just.
The meritocracy that Harvard presides over has never been purely a product of merit. If our commitment to intellectual excellence is sincere, our admissions process — especially at the College — ought to reflect that. That means scrapping legacy status, increasing transparency regarding Dean’s List admissions, and striving to further distinguish merit from mere socioeconomic advantage.
Beyond our backyard, Biden and his Cambridge-centric team ought to pursue reforms that facilitate equal access to quality education at every level. That might include following up on the campaign promise to make community college tuition-free, as well as pursuing ambitious reform of public school funding and its inequality-inducing reliance on property taxes. Vice President Kamala Harris might also serve as an inspiration — she is not only the first female, Black, and South Asian individual to hold the office, but also the first Vice President in United States history to graduate from a historically Black university. To help ensure she isn’t the last, the Biden administration should place more emphasis on mitigating the federal funding gap between predominantly white Ivy League institutions and their historically Black counterparts.
We are, of course, proud that so many Harvard community members have dedicated themselves to lives of public service – and we hope to see them utilizing their education for the betterment of all people in this society. But Harvard’s position at the forefront of American professional life, while an indelible part of its brand, is also an institutional responsibility. We should all be wary of the potential exclusion of individuals with equal – and perhaps greater – qualifications who lack the benefit of an elite pedigree.

The boundaries of Harvard College’s campus are permeable. Harvard students register for courses at MIT, and MIT students cross Cambridge to take classes in the Yard. Ivy League student athletes shuttle back and forth between campuses for games and matches, and nearly the whole of Harvard’s student body makes a pilgrimage to Yale to watch the schools’ football teams face off.
Harvard Intercollegiate Model United Nations travels to competitions far and wide, the Harvard Krokodiloes cavort across the globe performing acapella, and the Harvard College Debating Union hosts competitors in Cambridge. Students from neighboring institutions like Lesley University and Boston College join forces with Harvard students to do service work through Phillips Brooks House Association, and undergraduates from Boston University, Wellesley College, and Tufts University converge for late-night parties at Harvard’s final clubs.
“Your college experience would not be an interesting one if all you ever did was interact with each other,” said Hannah Brenner Johnson, a professor specializing in gender power dynamics at the California Western School of Law.
But students’ ability to experience life at nearby academic institutions can cause problems, too. It can expose them to a heightened risk of being sexually assaulted or harassed by members of other institutions. If they choose to raise concerns, it can force them to navigate byzantine complaint processes in unfamiliar places.
Naomi R. Shatz, a partner at the Zalkind, Duncan & Bernstein group who has worked on a number of Title IX cases at Boston area colleges, said inter-school sexual assault incidents are “very common.”
It’s no surprise that this would be the case — especially in the greater Boston area, which is home to several dozen universities and colleges.
A Harvard undergraduate who alleged she was assaulted by a student at a neighboring university and an undergraduate from a neighboring university allegedly assaulted by a Harvard student interviewed by The Crimson both said they faced both logistical and psychological hurdles while seeking restitution through Title IX offices.
These women represent just two examples of the many individuals caught between institutions as they pursue complaints of sexual misconduct. At Harvard alone, roughly 20 percent of Title IX complaints investigated by the University from 2015 to 2019 were filed by third parties, according to the University’s 2019 Office for Dispute Resolution Title IX Office report.
“Sexual violence isn’t contained within the boundaries of what we think of as campus,” said Priya P. Kukreja ’21, a member of the sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better.
Brenner Johnson said legislators did not substantively consider the potential for inter-institutional cases when they passed Title IX — a federal civil rights law that protects people from sex-based discrimination in education programs or activities that receive federal funding — as part of the Education Amendments of 1972.
“These cases bring up a lot of really unanticipated scenarios that schools are just really unequipped to deal with,” she said.
These kinds of inter-institutional situations are “the Achilles heel of Title IX,” said Heidi H. Lockwood, a professor at Southern Connecticut State University who advocates on behalf of women subject to sexual misconduct at universities.
Lockwood said this type of case came to the legal fore in 2014 after three Brown University football players allegedly assaulted a woman enrolled at Providence College, and she filed a complaint with Brown’s Title IX office.
After the Providence College student sued Brown for failing to give her a prompt investigation, a federal judge ruled in 2017 that students are not protected by Title IX at an institution with which they are not affiliated in the first place.
“The total absence of a relationship between Ms. Doe's educational institution (Providence College) and the harassers' school (Brown University) is dispositive on the issue of whether Ms. Doe has a Title IX claim against Brown in this case,” the judge wrote in his finding. “Therefore, the Court finds that Ms. Doe has not alleged that she was denied equal access to education as required for a Title IX claim to exist.”
This ruling has not affected Harvard’s approach, according to Harvard University Title IX Coordinator Nicole M. Merhill. She wrote in an email that Harvard’s Title IX Resource Coordinators and the University Title IX Office regularly receive disclosures from third parties, including affiliates of local colleges and universities.
Title IX regulations are constantly in flux, especially with frequent lawsuits, new legal precedents, and changes in presidential administrations.
Under Trump-appointed U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who stepped down in early January, the Department of Education released new regulations governing campus sexual assault under Title IX in May 2020. The new rule, which significantly restricted schools’ jurisdiction over sexual assault cases, took effect in August. President Joe Biden’s policy director Stefanie G. Feldman told reporters in November the administration planned to return to Obama-era Title IX policies.
For a complaint to be addressed under DeVos’s guidelines, the alleged sexual misconduct must have taken place on-campus or — if off-campus — in the context of a school-sponsored activity, building, or event over which the institution has “substantial control.”
To cover the cases the new rule left out, Harvard introduced a supplemental “Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy,” which protects members of the University who suffer a “hostile environment” as a result of sexual misconduct — even if it did not occur on campus or in connection with University-recognized activities.
But even in cases when a university agrees to investigate a non-affiliate’s complaint against one of its members, the complainant must confront compounded obstacles inherent in navigating an unfamiliar institution, according to two students who spoke to The Crimson about their experiences.
“We’re talking about somebody who has experienced abuse and trauma, and making that student jump through all of these administrative hoops,” Brenner Johnson said.
In the winter of 2019, a student at another Boston-area college — who was granted anonymity by The Crimson — decided to file a complaint against a Harvard student. She described an encounter from the previous fall, in which she alleged the Harvard student had raped her in his dorm. At the end of eight months, Harvard substantiated her complaint, she said, but not before an expensive, exhausting process.
She said she had to take several 40 minute, $40 Uber round-trips between her campus and Harvard for her Title IX interviews, paying out of pocket. Each time she arrived in Cambridge, she remembered feeling “terrified” of running into her assailant.
To her, Harvard’s campus was the place where she had been assaulted. To him, it was home.
Though Harvard offered her a phone interview, the student said she felt it was important that she speak to the investigative party in person in order to convey the emotional impact the incident had on her. She wondered why, given the proximity of her institution to Harvard’s campus, University investigators couldn’t offer to meet with her in a neutral location.
After numerous trips, the investigators from the Office for Dispute Resolution found her assailant culpable, and the case moved to Harvard’s Administrative Board to determine disciplinary action, she said. The University charges two different bodies with conducting its investigatory and disciplinary processes.
Harvard students have the option to be represented during the Ad Board process by their resident dean, a House administrator who supports undergraduates in all aspects of Harvard residential life and with whom they may already have a personal relationship.
The complainant, however, received an appointed representative — a Harvard administrator — whom she had never previously met. She said the designated representative was often slow to respond to her inquiries about the process, including the timeline and implications of various outcomes.
They sometimes took a week or several weeks to deliver an answer to procedural or technical questions, she said. Once they redirected her to another administrator who never responded, even after a number of follow-up emails.
Ideally, the woman said, the Ad Board could have permitted an administrator from her own school to represent her. At the very least, she added, the Harvard administrator could have set up an informal introductory meeting over the phone or Zoom.
The student said she felt that she would have received more consideration from administrators had she attended Harvard. The respondent automatically received accommodations during Harvard’s reading and exam periods due to the investigation; she had to proactively request that Harvard grant her similar extensions on her statements to ODR while she took tests.
Merhill, the University Title IX Coordinator, wrote in the email that Harvard makes an effort to help complainants from other institutions.
“In such instances, we engage with those individuals to explore available resources and options,” she wrote. “This may involve identifying the point of contact at the impacted individual’s school so they may access supportive measures there, including available mental health resources at their schools.”
That student’s situation can also happen in reverse, as Harvard affiliates venture beyond campus.
A Harvard undergraduate who filed a complaint with MIT in 2019 against one of its graduate students said she had a similarly intimidating experience as an “outsider” going through its Title IX process.
The undergraduate — who was granted anonymity by The Crimson — said she met the MIT student at an officially-recognized Harvard club that accepted non-Harvard College students as members. Between October and December 2017, she said, the man groomed her and coerced her into sexual activity on the MIT campus. In 2019, she encountered him again when she was an employee and he was a volunteer with the club.
The student — who said she experienced “intense anxiety” when she saw him — decided to file a Title IX complaint with Harvard that June, hoping to remove him from the summer program. Just after receiving her report, Harvard’s Title IX office instructed her to take her case to their counterparts at MIT since the MIT student was not a Harvard affiliate, she said. She filed with MIT the same day.
MIT’s Title IX office ultimately dismissed her complaint in September 2019, after the Harvard organization’s summer programming had already concluded, according to the student. In its response to the Harvard student, MIT wrote that its investigators found that her allegations against the MIT graduate student — even if true — would not constitute a violation of the institution’s Title IX policy, she said.
Beyond the outcome, the Harvard student said she felt her status as a non-MIT affiliate made the process especially difficult. If Harvard had investigated her case, she said she would have had friends who had gone through similar experiences with Harvard’s Title IX office and other on-campus advocates — like her resident dean.
With MIT’s Title IX office — a “faceless kind of monolith” — serving as her single point of entry to the institution, the Harvard student said she felt like she didn’t have anybody “on [her] team.” She added that she felt like an “outsider” without the power or standing to request resources, more frequent communication, or more transparency — especially as she began to feel that the process dragged. Her case began to resemble a “black box,” she said.
She said she decided not to consult Harvard’s Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response for support because she wasn’t sure they would be privy to the specifics of her case, nor would they have extensive knowledge of MIT’s Title IX procedures.
Sarah Rankin, a director and Title IX coordinator for MIT’s Discrimination and Harassment Response Office, declined to comment on any individual cases. However, she wrote in an email that MIT takes all allegations of sexual misconduct implicating its affiliates “very seriously.”
When MIT receives a report, the Title IX coordinator or case manager will reach out to the complainant and offer to meet with them, regardless of whether they are an MIT affiliate.
“Our office’s practice is to give all parties comprehensive information about MIT’s policies and processes, including information about their right to have an advisor of their choice attend interviews and meetings with them,” she wrote. “We also encourage all parties to contact the Title IX Coordinator or Case Manager at any point in the process with questions, concerns, or requests for support.”
Still, the Harvard student said that not being an MIT student led to the intimidating experience that she was “fighting the whole institution, rather than one person.”
For the students, seeking restitution at an unfamiliar institution made an already harrowing process even more logistically and psychologically burdensome.
Those problems could improve, though, Brenner Johnson said. She suggested that an “impartial entity” could investigate inter-institutional Title IX cases to erase the damaging dichotomy between outsiders and insiders.
Lockwood said universities must think in a “holistic way” about what is required to create a safe campus climate and culture for students.
“There's a difference between legal and ethical obligations,” Lockwood said. “Setting aside the law, the spirit of Title IX is not compatible with drawing a bright line between insiders and outsiders.”
Short of such a “radical rethinking,” however, Brenner Johnson said that there are a number of steps institutions can take to better serve third-party complainants.
She noted, for example, that there could be a provision in the Title IX supporting guidelines that encourages greater cooperation and information sharing between institutions. Such channels of streamlined communication could spare students from having to repeatedly relay their experiences in order to request mental health care, academic accommodations, or other support.
Brenner Johnson suggested that it’s possible there are more inter-institutional sexual assault incidents that go unreported because students are intimated by the prospect of interfacing with an institution that is not their own.
“I mean, think about it, if you go to visit a friend’s campus for the weekend, and you are sexually assaulted on that campus, it may not even occur to you that you could take advantage of that institution’s Title IX policies,” she said. “And then, of course, if you run into some of these brick walls we’ve been talking about, I think — for many people — it just sends them back into their lives to cope with this however they can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Montana Gov. Stephen C. "Steve" Bullock — a Democrat who has also made runs for the White House and Senate — and five other eminent political figures will serve as fellows at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics this spring, per an announcement on Wednesday.
The cohort of fellows also includes Bonnie Glick, the Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development under President Donald Trump; William “Bill” Kristol ’73, the founding director of Defending Democracy Together; Janet A. Hook ’77, a national political reporter for the Los Angeles Times’s Washington Bureau; Nsé Ufot, the Chief Executive Officer of the New Georgia Project; and Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton, Calif.
In the email announcing the fellows, IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote that he was “grateful” the fellows will be spending the spring semester with the IOP — albeit virtually — at such “an important moment in our civic life.”
“Their experiences as a governor and presidential candidate, diplomat, journalist, thought leader, mayor, and activist provide unique perspectives to share,” he wrote. “Harvard students will be able to engage with them on critical topics – from COVID to voter participation, the first 100 days of the Biden presidency to the future of the Republican Party.”
Nadia R. Douglas ’23 and Victor E. Flores ’23, student co-chairs of the IOP’s Fellows and Study Groups, wrote in the announcement that they are eager to welcome the fellows this spring.
“The world is watching the United States, waiting to see how our newly elected leaders will address the global pandemic, economic crisis, and domestic polarization,” they noted. “This cohort will help our community make sense of this inflection point and where we go from here, while continuing to inspire students’ passion for public service.”
On Twitter, Glick wrote that she was “very excited” to work with the other new fellows.
“I'm heading back to school,” she wrote.
Trump nominated Glick to her role as USAID Deputy Administrator in April 2019 and the Senate voted unanimously to confirm her in January 2019; she was fired, though, on Nov. 6, 2020.
Tubbs — known as a rising star in the Democratic Party who narrowly lost re-election as Stockton mayor last November — also took to Twitter to comment on the news, writing that he is “excited to share hard earned insights” with Harvard affiliates.
The fellows will appear in introductory forums at the IOP on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4.

As some students, faculty, and staff return to campus for the spring semester, Harvard has set up a testing apparatus aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus. Students living in campus housing have to get tested three times each week; most other affiliates regularly spending more than four hours on campus each week must be tested once a week. Harvard is also providing once-a-week testing to enrolled undergraduates living off-campus in the greater Cambridge area.
This semester, Harvard College rolled out a color-coded system that represents different phases of campus reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic. Each color — red, orange, yellow, lime, and green — represents the gradual easing of campus restrictions and opening of more on-campus spaces.
Below is a summary of the data Harvard has reported about test results on campus and an indication of the College's current reopening status.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spyce, a fast-casual eatery that serves bowls and salads engineered by an automated kitchen, celebrated the opening of its Harvard Square location on Wednesday.
The restaurant, located at 1 Brattle Square — in a storefront formerly occupied by Chipotle — is the second location of the Boston-based chain, which was founded by four MIT graduates and is backed by renowned French chef Daniel Boulud.
Spyce was slated to open in early 2020, but the onset of the coronavirus pandemic delayed construction at the site.
Michael Farid, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spyce, said he and his three co-founders — Braden Knight, Kale T. Rogers, and Luke Schlueter — opened Spyce to pursue their passion for engineering and food.
“I started my Master's in robotics and I became really interested in restaurants,” Farid said. “Specifically, I became really interested in the idea of making healthy food more accessible and more affordable and more convenient.”
“It started out as a very small idea: let's build a stir-fry robot,” he added. “And then once we did that, we realized we were more excited about the idea of serving food than building machines.”
The Spyce founders engineered an “Infinite Kitchen” — a set of automated flattop grills, steamers, and precise measuring systems — to prepare the ingredients and seasonings for its warm bowls and seasonal salads.
The precise technology of the Infinite Kitchen allows patrons to enjoy meals that can be customized to accommodate guests’ dietary preferences, including “eight major allergens” and “eight major diets,” according to the restaurant's website.
Elisabeth Allison ’67, who ordered from Spyce on opening day, said the restaurant’s concept and use of robots to customize dishes was “great.”
“I think it’s particularly period appropriate, given the period we’re in,” she said. “It was very simple. Lots of choices, but all clear.”
Farid said he and his co-founders are “excited” about how the Infinite Kitchen technology will impact customer experience.
“We're really excited about the technology we've built. It's really fast, it's really consistent, it's really convenient and it allows people to customize any aspect of a meal and personalize any aspect of their meal. There's almost no wait time,” Farid said.
Theodora M. Skeadas ’12, the executive director of Cambridge Local First — of which Spyce is a member — said she was “excited” about Spyce coming to Harvard Square.
“I live in Harvard Square, and it’s been so difficult because everything has been closed and we don’t really get good news,” she said. “So we are very, very happy that they’re opening.”
“It’s been a very difficult year for small businesses,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics remained the most popular concentration for the Class of 2023, with 186 declared sophomores, according to data provided by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Director of Institutional Research Karen Pearce.
The number of new Economics concentrators decreased only slightly from 193 for the Class of 2022, despite markedly lower enrollment in the fall semester due to students taking leaves during the Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 1,292 sophomores declared concentrations this year, compared to 1,633 last year, a decrease of 20 percent.
“We are delighted that large numbers of students find economics interesting, useful, or both,” Jeffrey A. Miron, the director of undergraduate studies in Economics, wrote in an email. “Our only regret is that we can’t greet our new (or existing) concentrators in person for now.”
Computer Science retained its position as the second most popular concentration, with 120 declared sophomore concentrators, a slight decline from 156 in the Class of 2022. In the past decade, the number of concentrators in the department has nearly tripled — just 47 sophomores declared the contraction in 2010.
Boaz Barak, co-director of undergraduate studies in Computer Science, cited the appeal of the department’s flexibility in allowing joint concentrators to explore multidisciplinary research as an explanation for the number of concentrators.
“Computer Science these days does indeed interface with many areas, including the sciences, economics, health, policy, and even the humanities,” Barak wrote in an email. “One thing that helps is that we take a ‘big tent’ view of computer science. CS is not just about coding, and correspondingly not every CS thesis needs to be about coding.”
Government retained its spot as the third most popular concentration, with 111 sophomores declared as of January 2021.
Despite its rank among concentrations, the Government department has seen a decline in concentrators over the past decade. The department had 473 total concentrators in 2011, compared with 313 in 2019.
Nara Dillon, director of undergraduate studies in Government, attributed the net decline to the increase in students who choose STEM-related fields given a changing job market, with fewer law and public sector jobs.
She also credited new tracks within the concentration — public policy, political economy, tech science, and data science — for attracting concentrators this year.
“These voluntary programs are designed to help students choose courses that will help them develop skills and expertise within political science, which is a very diverse discipline,” Dillon wrote in an email. “We hope this is an early indication that our new programs are drawing some interest from students.”
Other popular concentrations included Applied Mathematics and Neuroscience, at 100 and 78 declared sophomore concentrators, respectively.
Social Studies saw a marked decline in concentrators, with just 52 new concentrators, compared to 100 in the previous academic year.
“Our best guess is that a lot of sophomores who are on leave now will enroll in Social Studies 10a next fall and declare Social Studies as their concentration,” Anya B. Bassett, director of undergraduate studies in Social Studies, wrote in an email. “We are enjoying getting to know our smaller class of sophomores (2023) and we are looking forward to welcoming a larger class of sophomores (former members of the class of 2023, plus members of the class of 2024) next fall.”
By division, the Arts and Humanities division continued its gradual decline in declared concentrators, falling from 263 in the Class of 2013 to just 115 in the Class of 2023. SEAS, meanwhile, rose from 174 declared concentrators to 293 in the last 10 years.
Environmental Science and Engineering, the newest concentration at the College, also saw decreased interest, with just two declared sophomore concentrators, down from eight. Theater, Dance, and Media, another recently added concentration, also had only one declared sophomore concentrator, down from eight last year.
Sophomores were required to officially declare their concentrations by Nov. 19. However, they may change their path of study after that date.

Picture this: it’s 8:59 a.m. on a Monday morning and you just woke up when you realize class starts in one minute. You lean over to grab your hoodie from the previous day(s) and slide it over your head, simultaneously powering up your laptop and frantically digging through Canvas to find the Zoom link for class. As you sink back into the comfort of your sheets you’re greeted with many tiny squares displaying the professor, a couple enthusiastic students who have clearly woken up at least fifteen minutes prior to class (and are already caffeinated), and of course, those like you: camera off with a perpetual “connecting to audio…” You’re trying your best to remain in a vertical position when suddenly your worst nightmare is realized: someone (perhaps the professor? Words and voices are a blur at this point) says the words, “let’s go into breakout rooms and do a little icebreaker.”
But fear not. Here’s a list of four social situations that are even more awkward than breakout room icebreakers, to make you feel better about that not-so-fun fact you just accidentally told ten other strangers.
1. The irl Yard run-ins
Let’s face it—we’ve forgotten how to talk to people. No, TikTok duets don’t count. And neither does dropping memes in the GroupMe at 3 a.m. Meeting people on campus this semester has been… interesting, to say the least. Wave at a friend and get ignored because they don’t recognize you in a mask? Jump into conversations with complete strangers under the pretense of thinking they are someone else? Don’t worry, it happens to the best of us. Or the worst. You decide.
2. Unexpected realities
We get it, people look very different from the shoulders up in a tiny square on a Zoom call than they do in person. Was someone emanating 6-foot-3-inch vibes but ended up being 5 feet in person? Admit it, we’ve all been there. Just try not to tell them to their face. “Johnny! So nice to finally meet you! You’re so short!” never plays out too well.
3. Ghosting gone wrong
If you’re on campus this semester, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll run into people you know (in those rare instances you leave the shelter of your dorm), especially near hotspots like the dining halls or test drop-offs. But does that mean you want to hang out with them? Not necessarily. “Wanna grab lunch?” “No, sorry, I have class in a few…” There you are ten minutes later, locking eyes with them across the steps of Widener as you devour your latest HUDS meal, clearly not mid-Zoom lecture. Or maybe you were. You do you, little warrior.
4. Zoom… situations
The only thing worse than Zoom icebreaker breakout rooms is… more Zoom. Perhaps you’re an excessively eager Zoomer and hop on the lecture call a few minutes early, only to be trapped in a room with the professor and two TF’s of the course discussing the telepathic abilities of their cats. Or maybe you were just sprinkling the final touch of seasoning on your instant ramen during section, when the TF asks you directly what you thought about that point Maxwell just made regarding philosophical dualism. And arguably the winner of them all: you’re preparing for your audition with America’s Got Talent by screeching Taylor Swift’s latest album at the top of your lungs, when the professor patiently reminds the class to please mute themselves. It’s no surprise that Ec10a never saw your (virtual) face again.
Long story short, icebreaker breakout sessions aren’t the absolute worst thing you may experience throughout the Zoom college experience. In fact, they’re arguably up there with the positives (at least you get to meet new people… ?). And hey, on the even brighter side, you’re getting closer and closer to acing that audition for America’s Got Talent with every muted Zoom lecture. At least, that’s what the professor said last time ;)
