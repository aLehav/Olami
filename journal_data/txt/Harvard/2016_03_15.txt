After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a solo artist, Zayn Malik is purportedly striving to make the music he could not with One Direction. “iT’s YoU,” the creatively capitalized track from his upcoming album, “Mind of Mine,” is one such example: This hazy, beautifully spare torch-song-cum-slow-jam would not have worked half so well with another four boys’ voices piled on. Whether “iT’s YoU” quite succeeds as proof of Zayn’s new persona, or even just as a song, is a separate question.
It’s mostly deftly composed, built around a stunning, flickering synth and a deep heartbeat thump of a drum. (The less that is said about the bridge—which, in featuring sugary strings and other such ooey orchestral flourishes, sounds as if it were beamed in from another sonic universe entirely—the better.) Over this generally sound construction, Zayn unleashes perhaps his most stunning vocal performance to date, especially in the chorus, where he weightlessly floats up into the upper reaches of his range, singing the song’s title phrase in a woozy, androgynous, near-angelic falsetto. He has a lovely run up there, drifting impossibly high and then higher still, fitting in a good several vocal climaxes, before finally he reluctantly descends.
The chorus is so ravishingly perfect that it is good thing that the song seems to be almost all chorus. The rest of the track doesn’t hold up quite so well, largely due to the subpar lyrics, which alternate between boilerplate pseudo-diaristic mush and real meanness. The latter is another difference from his 1D days: At last, Zayn gets to have some bite, and he goes at it perhaps too keenly, opening the track with an almost vicious verse about an ex before turning his sights on his current paramour, whom he also paints—if in a more lovelorn fashion—as a woman who has done him wrong. But perhaps it doesn’t matter. Writing a catty song about one’s ex is practically a solo pop singer’s birthright, and wounded, pretty, and mean is a look Zayn wears well.
“Mind of Mine” out 3/25 on RCA Records.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, agreed Monday to allow Harvard Law School to remove and replace its seal, which features the crest of a slaveholding family.
The Corporation’s decision comes a little more than a week after a Law School committee chaired by Law Professor Bruce H. Mann recommended to remove the seal. In a letter addressed to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and signed by University President Drew G. Faust and Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation applauded the committee’s work and endorsed its recommendation.
“Following a review of the committee report, the ‘different view’ conveyed by Professor Gordon-Reed and Ms. Rittgers, and your own memorandum, the Corporation agrees with your judgment and the recommendation of the committee that the Law School should have the opportunity to retire its existing shield and propose a new one.” 
Scrutiny into the seal’s origins came to a head last fall when a group of students dubbed “Royall Must Fall” called for the seal’s removal because of its ties to slavery. After pieces of black tape were found over the portraits of black Law professors in November, student activism about race relations at the Law School intensified, prompting Law School Dean Martha L. Minow to convene a committee to reconsider the seal.
The committee of 12 students, faculty, staff, and alumni hosted a series of meetings with Law school affiliates over the course of three months and released its final report to the Corporation March 4, along with a dissenting opinion authored by Law Professor Annette Gordon-Reed. Minow also wrote a letter to the Corporation supporting the committee’s conclusion.
The seal—three sheaves of wheat under an emblem emblazoned with 'Veritas'—bears the crest of the former slaveholding Royall family, whose donation endowed Harvard’s first professorship of Law in the 19th century. The emblem was not adopted as the Law School’s seal until 1937, however, and was not widely used until the second half of the 20th century. In its report, the committee cited the seal’s relatively recent origins as reason to remove it, an argument the Corporation pointed to in its letter.
While the timeline for the selection of a new seal remains unclear, Lee and Faust suggested in their letter that the Law School choose a new one for the school’s bicentennial celebration in 2017.
“You should feel free to discontinue use of the shield as soon as you see fit, and we will look forward to receiving your eventual recommendation for a new shield, ideally in time for it to be introduced for the School’s bicentennial in 2017,” the letter reads.
The Corporation’s decision about the Law School’s seal comes as historical names and titles have faced increased scrutiny across the University. At the College, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced last month that House masters would now be called Faculty Deans, citing concerns about the racial connotations of the term “master.” In a December interview, Faust, a Civil War historian, cautioned against the wholesale reconsiderations of names, titles, or symbols at Harvard because of their darker pasts, arguing that history—even when troubling—should be remembered, not erased. Monday’s letter about the Law School’s seal strikes the same note.
“While we accept the request to change the shield, we do so on the understanding that the School will actively explore other steps to recognize rather than to suppress the realities of its history, mindful of our shared obligation to honor the past not by seeking to erase it, but rather by bringing it to light and learning from it,” Faust and Lee wrote.
Student activists were unsurprised but pleased with the Corporation’s decision. “I think that this represents the culmination of a lot of activism by students all across Harvard Law School, and I’m thankful that the Corporation has finally done the right thing,” Alexander J. Clayborne, a member of Royall Must Fall, said.
Clayborne said activists will continue to push the Law School to meet their other demands, including reforming the school’s curriculum and hiring more minority faculty members.
In a letter to Law School affiliates Monday, Minow wrote that the school will now turn its attention to the logistics of removing the seal and re-configure its web pages by mid-April. Already, the school's Twitter page features a new photo as its emblem, one without the seal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team enjoyed a successful weekend against Providence and Rhode Island, claiming 7-0 wins in both contests.
Despite a warm week in Cambridge, the matches were played inside Harvard’s Murr Center. Without any wind or obstruction from the sun, Harvard (7-6) was completely dominant in both contests.
The Crimson enjoyed a long break after consecutive losses in North Carolina against William and Mary and Old Dominion. Two weeks later, the team came out fresh in what was its most dominant performance this season. With Ivy League matches on deck, the Crimson hope it is hitting its stride at the right time.
Harvard, 7, Rhode Island, 0
Harvard continued its Sunday afternoon doubleheader with a match against Rhode Island (2-8). The Rams have struggled this season, suffering 7-0 defeats in six of their 10 matches this season.
The pattern continued against Harvard. The Crimson would claim the doubles point with wins in the day’s first two matches. Sophomore Annika Ringblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong claimed a 6-0 victory while junior June Lee and freshman Isabel Jasper did the same.
Harvard would continue the day’s dominance with a strong outing in the singles’ matchups. All Crimson players would win in straight sets. Jasper did not lose a set against Rhode Island freshman Nicole Kalver, taking both sets, 6-0.
Jasper’s classmate Xiong only conceded one set on the afternoon, defeating Rams’ junior Jordan Rucks, 6-1, 6-0.
Harvard, 7, Providence, 0
The Friars (3-3) entered the contest with Harvard having won two of their last three matches. The one loss came against Ivy League foe, Brown, which the Crimson will take on later next month after getting the best of Bears in the semifinals of the ECAC championships.
From the start of doubles play, Harvard made quick work of its guests. The Crimson has struggled to win matches this season when losing the doubles point but the team would not have to worry about coming from behind this weekend.
Each of the three Harvard doubles pairs took care of their Providence counterparts. The duo of Ringblom and Xiong won 6-1 as did captain Amy He and freshman Erica Oosterhout. Lee and sophomore Nikki Kallenberg would go on to win, 6-3.
The Crimson did not let up. After beating the Friars 18-5 in doubles, Harvard would not surrender a single set to a Providence player in singles action. In fact, in just one match did a Providence player win more than two games in a set. Senior Alana Prinos managed to win five games against Lee in the first set, but she would still go on to lose in straight sets, 7-5, 6-1. All other matches would finish by a score of either 6-0, 6-1, or 6-2.
Throughout Sunday, the Crimson consistently broke the serves of its opponents and will need to continue this trend when it travels to Santa Barbara later this week to face Loyola Marymount, UC Santa Barbara, and Fresno State.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Led by senior Aliya Itzkowitz’s gold medal in women’s saber, the men’s and women’s fencing squads competed their way to 10 top-10 finishes at the NCAA Northeast Regionals in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. over the weekend.
Women’s Fencing
Headlined by senior Aliya Itzkowitz and junior co-captain Adrienne Jarocki, the women’s team claimed six top-10 finishes at the Northeast Regionals.
Itzkowitz and Jarocki’s one-two finish in the saber division was reminiscent of the pair’s gold and silver sweep at the NCAA Individual Championships two years ago, but at this event, it was the Great Britain native who took the top spot. Both fencers secured their respective spots in the national championships, which will be held starting March 24 at Brandeis.
The gold medal was Itzkowitz’s first in four tries at the NCAA Northeast Regionals.
In the epee division, it was the first-year fencers who shined brightest for the Crimson. Sharon Ra’s 7-4 final round effort was enough to secure her a bronze medal spot and NCAA national qualifying spot in her first NCAA individual event, while Shawn Wallace notched at 6-5 record to finish eighth.
Three Harvard foil fencers earned first and second round pool play byes thanks to their pre-tournament rankings. After entering the event as the 23rd-ranked foil fencer competing, junior Hali Nelson fenced to a 5-6 record in the final round to finish eighth, while freshman Liana Henderson-Semel was right behind her teammate in ninth.
Men’s Fencing
The No. 6-ranked Crimson men’s squad came into the Northeast Regionals with eight fencers competing and came away with four top-10 finishes.
Leading the way was co-captain and foil fencer Michael Woo, who just missed the podium and finished fifth after a 6-5 record combined with a plus-10 touch differential. Classmate Jerry Chang also had six wins in the final round of pool play and finished in seventh, while junior Stephen Mageras was eighth.
Ranked 19th heading into the event, sophomore saber fencer Eric Zhao competed his way into the third and final round of pool play, and his 5-6 record was enough for an eighth-place finish. Senior Alexander Ryjik was not far behind in 11th.
