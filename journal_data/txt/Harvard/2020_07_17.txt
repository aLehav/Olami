After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ho Sok Fong’s “Lake Like a Mirror” sits at the cross-section of cultures, worlds, and identities. Fong is Malaysian, writes in Chinese, and now the short story collection is available in English, ready to be devoured. Most of the book’s characters are women, and yet their experiences and visions are anything but monolithic: Fong captures the simultaneous dreamlike haze and sharp clarity of the human brain, lending each story an ethereality that is soothing and, at times, unsettling.
Many of the stories end with no satisfying resolution, either petering out or leaving the reader with more questions than answers. This ambiguity can be frustrating or soothing. In the case of “The Wall,” a story chronicling the daily lives of those in a community by a highway — soon to be separated by a wall — one woman particularly disturbed by the construction leaves, and the story ends. There is no explanation and there are no further details given, reflecting how people come and go from the lives of others outside of the literary world. Stories do not end, per se: They become part of the next small narrative of life, or fade away into background fabric. The effect, in “The Wall” and in other stories like “Radio Drama,” is at once jarring and cohesive.
Fong’s writing is reminiscent of magical realism in that the heroines navigate eeriness or elements of something supernatural. In “March in a Small Town,” for example, Cui Yi follows a man who stays at her hotel every day without acknowledging the fact that he has been there many times. She cannot figure out why he pretends to not know her, nor how he is able to travel by train and then promptly return to the hotel.
Yet beneath the ethereality, each woman is grappling with some kind of constraint or injustice: housing uncertainty, old age and the loss of memory, abusive lovers, unforgiving labor conditions. There is a realness to these stories that is only amplified by their haziness, as they come to expertly mimic the ways in which we perceive our own reality. Not everything is always objective or clear, leading to sentences like this: “So she had done something she would never have normally done: she had scraped off her shell and risked throwing her whole body into the open.”
“Aminah” stands out among the nine stories for its evocative brutality, a seemingly impossible combination of descriptors. It implicitly and explicitly criticizes Malaysian laws decreeing that any person born to a Muslim parent must also be Muslim themselves, making it impossible to leave Islam. Aminah lives among other men and women who appear to have tried to escape. She, however, makes the lives of the wardens and religious figures difficult, sleepwalks naked, and questions everything. But despite the sharpness of the collisions between the characters, Fong’s trademark blurriness remains. The two elements combine beautifully, intensifying in the following linked story, “Wind through the Pineapple Leaves, through the Frangipani.”
It’s worth mentioning, also, that translation is notoriously difficult work. Choosing the right words for the translation to make sense, while also ensuring that they match the intention of the author — as well as balancing the nuances of the target language such that readers feel the words’ impact just as viscerally as those who read in the language of origin, is a form of art in its own right. Natascha Bruce does so masterfully, transmitting the fluidity and uncertainty with which Fong infuses many, if not all of her stories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Coalition for a Diverse Harvard is calling on the University to change the name of the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, because the term “overseer” historically referred to men hired by plantation owners to violently control slaves.
The board of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an activist group that supports “diversity, equity, and inclusion” at the University, started lobbying individual Overseers to change the name in 2017, according to Jane Sujen Bock, a board member of the Coalition.
Bock wrote in an email that this year, the Coalition asked all 13 Overseers candidates about the name change.
All five of the Overseer candidates the Coalition endorsed — David H. Eun ’89, Diego A. Rodriguez, Tracy K. Smith ’94, Raphael W. Bostic ’87, and Dorothy L. “Thea” Sebastian ’08 — supported the name change, per Bock.
“Many of the 13 Overseer candidates we interviewed had not previously considered the ramifications of the title's link to slavery,” Bock wrote. “However, all five of the Overseers that we endorsed have spoken eloquently about why the title, with its overt connection to an unconscionable institution, should be changed.”
Bock said nationwide anti-racism protests spurred a greater push to change the name of the Board of Overseers.
“Even in the few months since we conducted those interviews, there is increasing urgency to rename the Overseers as the Black Lives Matters movement has brought critical attention to the need for institutions to remove markers of slavery,” she wrote. “Now is the moment for Harvard to rename the Overseers in practice and then seek any charter change needed from the Massachusetts Legislature.”
University spokesperson Christopher A. Hennessy declined to comment on the effort.
This is not the first time the University has encountered pressure to change the name of a position or organization due to its affiliations with slavery. The term “House Master” was replaced with “Faculty Dean” in 2016; Harvard affiliates have also petitioned to change the name of Mather House due to its slaveholding namesake.
In June, the University of Louisville removed the term “Overseers” from its governing board and Honors House as part of its response to the ongoing racial justice movement.
Harvard Forward, a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change and recent alumni representation within Harvard’s governance boards, said they found the term “Overseers” to be “problematic” in a Wednesday Instagram post.
“The term ‘Overseer’ cannot be separated from its historical context and connotations. The continued use of a word characterized by such deep-rooted racism is a testament to Harvard’s failure to confront our country’s history,” they wrote.
Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, one of the candidates running under the Harvard Forward platform, said she believes the name should change.
“I understand what they were trying to do with it,” Purce said. “I think it’s tone deaf, and I think that especially now, it really resonates with people who think symbols and names matter, because they do.”
Jayson U. Toweh, another candidate, said the name itself is “older and antiquated,” tied to discriminatory practices in the past.
“I’m supportive of changing and updating it to something that is more appropriate in the modern context,” Toweh said.
Overseer candidate John E. Beatty ’11 agreed that it was hard to “divorce” the term “overseer” from its context within American slavery. He said that a renaming would help further clarify the role of the Board.
“We need to make a change,” he said. “I normally have to describe it as the alumni trustee board ... ‘The Board of Overseers’ is a bit of a relic around Harvard history and linguistics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Board of Overseers slate Harvard Forward began this year planning to host campaign events around the world, but with a public health crisis at hand, they have shifted to an online campaign format fit for a young group of candidates.
The group, an alumni campaign lobbying for climate change reforms and recent alumni representation on Harvard’s governance boards, announced March 17 that they would move their operations entirely online until social distancing was no longer necessary. But by April 1, Harvard announced it would delay its annual election from early April to early July as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic.
As the University’s second-highest governing body, the Overseers advise top Harvard officials, provide guidance for University decisions, and approve certain actions from the Harvard Corporation.
Harvard Forward candidates said the shift from in-person events to Zoom calls has not hindered their campaign. John E. Beatty ’11, Lisa Bi Huang, Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, Dorothy “Thea” Sebastian ’08, and Jayson U. Toweh are working to secure enough votes by August 18 to earn a seat on the Board.
Purce said the shift online was beneficial to their group because they are “younger candidates.” All of Harvard Forward’s candidates graduated from one of the University’s schools within the past 10 years.
“Naturally, the people we know and the people we're engaged with, they are more online,” Purce said.
Now that the election has officially kicked off, Beatty noted that most of his Facebook feed consists of Harvard Forward-related posts.
“I think that is, for me, one of the most fun and engaging parts of this, which is to reach out and connect with folks who maybe I hadn't talked to in a couple of years or had never met before,” Beatty said.
Beatty added that he believes working online presents an an opportunity to inform a wider swath of the voting population about the Board of Overseers election itself, which historically maintains low turnout. Last year, roughly 10 percent of Harvard’s more than 371,000 living alumni voted in the election.
“I’ve been receiving a lot of messages from LinkedIn, from Facebook — from friends and strangers and other Harvard alumnus — saying ‘Oh, I’m really excited for your platform and we’ll vote for you,’” Huang said. “It feels great to be connected with other people, even with strangers because we all belong to the same Harvard community.”
Similarly to Huang and Beatty, Toweh said he has utilized social media during this time to promote the election.
The online campaign has allowed the group to plan accessible virtual town halls, Purce said. She added that she believes Harvard Forward’s campaign will be successful if even one of the candidates wins a seat on the Board.
“I would say the goal is to get all of us on the board. That would be an absolutely wonderful thing,” Purce said. “But I think it’s successful if you get even one of us. Either can be a success.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Libraries published a new library guide Monday that collects open-access materials documenting the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic on Black Americans.
Created in partnership with the President’s Office for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging; the Harvard Graduate School of Education; and the Charles Hamilton Institute for Race and Justice; the guide has received more than 8,000 pageviews since its launch, according to Sarah J. DeMott, a College research librarian.
Director of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Tracie D. Jones said she was motivated to create the guide after seeing the virus’s effect on Black Americans, including her own family. She then enlisted DeMott’s help to develop the project.
“When you document something in an archive or in a library, it becomes a permanent resource for researchers in the future,” DeMott said.
“We have this wonderful potential to preserve this record and make sure that we acknowledge the disparities and the disproportionate impact on Black communities, but also the resilience and the way that Black communities have responded during this time,” she added.
The guide currently collects materials such as articles, podcasts, and poetry under 19 different topic headings, which vary from “Labor & Economy” to “Media, Television, Theater, & Film.” Its website lists a number of “co-curators,” composed of affiliates from Harvard and other universities.
The site also links to additional workshops and events, such as a “Community Survey” workshop that teaches participants how to document people’s experiences by compiling surveys. More than 160 Harvard affiliates have already registered for the “Anti-Racism Book and Film Club.”
Amsale “Amy” Alemu ’14, a graduate student in the African and African American Studies department, said the guide is a “great first step” toward starting conversations about the Black experience of COVID-19.
“It's a conversation that's of immediate importance not only for researchers, but also just for the general public,” Alemu said.
DeMott wrote in an email that the novelty of the pandemic shaped the materials that the guide collects. Instead of gathering published scholarly articles, DeMott and her collaborators turned to different kinds of works, such as Zoom interviews, podcasts, radio broadcasts, poetry, and photography.
Among the materials collected is “Where My Brothers and Sisters Have Been,” an original song submitted by incoming Harvard freshman LyLena Estabine ’24. Jones referred to this song as an example of how the works collected in the guide, and the guide itself, can contribute to movements protesting racial injustice.
“You don't have to be Black to write about this experience, or to read about this experience,” Jones said. “I actually believe it helps you to understand the lived experience of people who are different from you, when you use this guide or actually contribute to the guide.”
Alemu said Harvard and its libraries have a particular responsibility to shape national conversations.
“Harvard, especially for the public, is a voice of authority here,” she said, citing the recent withdrawal following a joint Harvard-MIT lawsuit of a DHS and ICE policy that would have prohibited some international students from remaining in the U.S.
“Harvard has power in that context, and sets a lot of priorities for public discourse,” Alemu added.
