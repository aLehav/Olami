After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When Rakesh Khurana becomes Dean of Harvard College on July 1, Harvard will have a permanent leader for the first time in a year. Professor Khurana’s experience with students both in a residential setting,as a House Master, and in an academic one, as a professor, make him an ideal fit for a position that oversees student education and student life. Professor Khurana has many challenges ahead, but he is an excellent choice to lead Harvard College.
 The only downside of Professor Khurana’s appointment is that it means parting with Interim Dean of Harvard College Donald H. Pfister. Since taking over in July, Dean Pfister has proven to be a friendly and warm presence. Dean Pfister stepped into his role at an extremely sensitive time. After the controversial end to former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’ term, students felt disconnected and distrustful of the administration. Dean Pfister set out to fix that. His efforts, from his amusing emails to his expanded office hours to his greater visibility in house dining halls, went a long way to improving students’ perception of the College administration. Dean Pfister’s tenure was a success, and he deserves our wholehearted thanks.
 Still, it is time for a permanent leader who can make long-term decisions. With the capital campaign and house renewal in full swing, Professor Khurana will have the opportunity to leave his mark on Harvard College. At the same time, the University will face ongoing financial pressure and skepticism about the value of a liberal arts education. Now is the right time to reevaluate the answers to basic questions: What should the role of a House be? What kind of environment should Harvard foster? What sort of education should Harvard provide? Professor Khurana will need to be a defender of Harvard’s values, an advocate for students, and a leader with a long-term vision.
 In the immediate future, Professor Khurana will have to deal with the ongoing fallout from the Gov 1310 cheating and email search scandals. While the disciplinary process from that course is over, the larger implications of the scandal still loom large. Further discussions about academic integrity and developing an honor code are on the horizon, but Professor Khurana should also work to improve the relationship between students and administrators. He should continue Dean Pfister’s outreach efforts, be visible all around campus, and be as accessible as possible. As the master of Cabot House, Professor Khurana has been friendly, approachable, and committed to students. In his new role, he should see himself as a master of the entire College.
 Even for the best candidate, however, the position comes with challenges. As Dean of the College, Professor Khurana will have little control over the budget, which is controlled by Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith. He will also have to work under a microscope. As the Gov 1310 scandal showed, Harvard attracts tremendous media attention. Other colleges will look to his decisions, and people far away from Cambridge will scrutinize his actions. His success will depend on his relationships with faculty, other administrators, and students.
 Professor Khurana has slightly over five months before he moves into University Hall. We hope he takes this time to prepare an ambitious agenda, eat in dining halls, go to athletic events, and spend time with students and faculty. On July 1, Dean Khurana will have a lot of work to do and high expectations to meet. We believe he will.

Major League Baseball has long been implicitly encouraging doping by doling out lax penalties to athletes caught taking performance-enhancing drugs. If MLB truly believes that steroids pervert the sanctity of baseball, it needs to reflect that belief with penalties that fit the crime. 
Earlier this month, an Arbitration Panel curtailed Rodriguez’s original 211-game suspension to a 162-game suspension—unprecedented penalties for doping either way. Though he never tested positive for using PED’s, there was overwhelming evidence linking him to the Biogenesis doping ring.  
According to his “nutritionist,” Anthony Bosch, Rodriguez followed a strict doping regimen and used elaborate schemes to avoid getting caught. However, it is unfair to judge Rodriguez without first analyzing the special relationship between the MLB and performance-enhancing drugs. In light of MLB’s ambiguous historic policy on PED’s, it is easy to understand what drove Alex Rodriguez to dope; he matured in an era where steroids were ubiquitous among top performers and were not only tolerated but also indirectly encouraged. 
The “steroids era,” which ran from the late 80s through the early 2000s, took off after the players strike in 1994-95 when MLB attendance and revenue were sinking. MLB implicitly encouraged the use of steroids by lavishing players suspected of using steroids with MVP awards, media attention, and huge contracts. During 1998, the “Year of the Homer,” MLB heavily promoted the homerun showdown between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, two sluggers who have since tested positive for PED’s. Doping essentially became a right of passage to join the top cadre of sluggers. 
Even though MLB banned PED’s in 1991, it took no action to penalize violators until 2005 and didn’t even start testing for them until 2003. In that year, after being caught doping, Rodriguez wasn’t penalized. Even after admitting to doping then, he maintained his endorsements and continued to be a fan favorite. He must have figured that there was a gentleman’s agreement between MLB and the players: as long as there were no egregious violations, doping would be tolerated. 
MLB took serious action only under pressure from Congress in 2005, when it instated 10-day suspensions for first-time violations, 30-day suspensions for second-time violations, 60-day suspensions for third-time violations, and a one-year ban for fourth-time violations.  
Only when Congress deemed these penalties to be too light, did MLB revise the penalties so that first-time violators would get 50-game suspension, second-time violators would get a 100-game suspension, and third-time violators would be suspended for life. In 2008, MLB finally increased testing for PED’s after the Mitchell Report exposed how rampant MLB doping culture truly was.  
In past doping scandals, MLB has notoriously turned a blind eye. Although Barry Bonds was indicted in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative scandal, he never received a suspension for using PED’s. He claimed that he’d unwittingly taken PED’s and never intended to have a leg up over his competition. Only after Bonds retired and could no longer draw crowds to its games did MLB passive-aggressively stall his entry to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Although the prevalence of doping was common knowledge during the steroids era, MLB claimed that it could do nothing about it because the player’s union was too powerful and gladly looked the other way. However, once the BALCO scandal was exposed and Congress began to pressure MLB to take action, the player’s union suddenly wasn’t as powerful as MLB had made it out to be. Just as MLB used the bogus excuse that it was powerless to enforce mandatory drug tests, it was also quick to accept Bonds’s outrageous claim of ignorance regarding his positive drug test. 
Baseball teams and fans should also shoulder some of the blame for encouraging PED use because they have historically been too forgiving of offenders and have rewarded past dopers with ever-larger contracts. The Yankees didn’t hesitate to play Rodriguez once he had appealed his doping suspension, and the Cardinals signed Jhonny Peralta for about triple his previous salary soon after he sat out his 50-game doping suspension. 
Rather than severely punishing one superstar and maintaining a relatively lax policy for everyone else, MLB should make it clear to its players that doping doesn’t pay—they won’t get to keep their multimillion-dollar salaries signed under false pretenses and won’t be honored in the Hall of Fame. 
MLB should instate an anti-doping policy similar to that of the Olympics, where any athlete caught doping is stripped of all his medals and is banned from competition for four years. Teams and fans also have to take a tough stance against doping and should put the sanctity of the game above winning. 
Diamondbacks reliever Brad Ziegler summed up the current baseball dilemma best: “It pays to cheat...Thanks, owners, for encouraging PED use.”

With a guest list that included Barack Obama, Ban Ki-moon, and Desmond Tutu, Thamsanqa Jantjie was never supposed to stand out. Yet, during Nelson Mandela’s memorial on December 11, 2013, Jantjie—a translator—would emerge as the focus of our fascination. Standing a few meters from the high-profile speakers, Jantjie had been moving his hands in a seemingly plausible routine of translation. Then people began to realize the incredible truth. The translator was doing nothing more than fidgeting and flapping his arms—the movement articulated no coherent thoughts.
Later, Jantjie would claim that he had suffered a schizophrenic attack during which he had heard voices and had seen angels descend to the earth. The next day, the media would reveal that Jantjie had been arrested on at least five occasions—accused of, among other things, murder, rape, and theft. He had avoided jail time because he was mentally unfit to stand trial. 
Two days after Mandela’s memorial service, Harvard woke up to the news of a bomb threat. At 8:40 a.m., a HUPD affiliate received an email that read, “science center [and] sever hall [and] emerson hall [and] thayer hall. 2/4. guess correctly. be quick for they will go off soon.” 
Exam period came to a temporary halt and the “Harvard community”—as the official communications labeled us—broke into huddled crowds scattered across campus. The suspicion was raised early that this was the work of a student who had panicked under the pressure of exams and had simply snapped. The following day, Eldo Kim ’16 confessed to sending the email to avoid a final exam. 
In that frantic month, madness seemed determined to capture our eye.
When we are confronted by mental illness or—as in the case of Kim—by cases that evoke its specter, our reaction tends to take one of three forms. If it seems mild to us, we trivialize it. We compare our situation to that of the sufferer, view them as being alike, and resolve that the difference must be made by our strength and their relative weakness. We ask internally—if not vocalize outright—the question, “Who doesn’t get anxious during finals?”
In more serious cases, where we cannot dismiss the fact of mental illness, we escape its reality by appealing to its absurdity. To buy distance between the mentally ill and us, we contrast the predictability of our lives against the volcanic spontaneity of these events. Slavoj Zizek writes in the Guardian, Thamsanqa Jantjie is the “something unexpected” that makes lives of drab routine worth living. On the “Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” Jantjie’s gestures became the Moment of Zen.
Finally, in instances where the outcome is undeniably and obviously tragic, we resign ourselves to performing the subdued histrionics of sympathy. As Eldo Kim awaits a decision on his future, we shake our heads and sigh on his and his family’s behalf. Safe in Annenberg Hall and in the dining rooms we might have shared with him, we are able to pronounce our regret and carry on with our day. 
Unfortunately for us, these are not emotions that drive progress. Instead, they seek to distance us from the discomfort and pain of confronting illness. 
Nicholas D. Kristof ‘81 proposed that mental health is the systematically neglected issue that deserves more attention in 2014. I argue that reversing that systematic neglect must begin by repudiating the instinctive response of distancing ourselves from the subject of that neglect. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, one in four American adults suffer from a diagnosable mental illness in any given year. To genuinely appreciate the pervasiveness of its reach and the depth of its impact is to dismiss the instinct to minimize, parody, or pity. To look around us is to realize that the distance we create is only of our mind’s delusion.
The Australian critic Clive James once observed that the language of “community” is crowding out the language of “society.” He writes that the indeterminate language of the former is a “device for glossing over the brutal fact that some poor kid had just been stabbed.” In the same way, mental illness is neither the problem of a community or of some of its members. It is the systematic failure of society. In one of the more poignant moments of his interview with the press, Thamsanqa Jantjie said, “Life is unfair. The illness is unfair.” 
When madness stares us in the face, we ought to have the courage to look back. It will not always do us such a courtesy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the beginning of the new semester comes a new Undergraduate Council, its members hoping to represent the student body’s wishes and advocate for their ideas. Students can also make their voices heard through the referendum process, by which students can submit proposals advocating for change at Harvard. These statements, if approved by the majority voters of at least 50 percent of the student body, then become binding UC policy.
 
There are some issues with the referendum process, however, that need to be addressed if the UC is accurately to maintain that it is representing the positions of the majority of the student body. These problems also need fixing if referenda are to be perceived as legitimate expressions of student positions on administrative policy.
 
The referenda questions in their current form offer little background to the questions at hand, perhaps in order to make sure that those questions are worded in an unbiased fashion. The water bottle referendum question this past fall, for instance, offered no history or statistics. Therefore, while students could vote based on the abstract ideas of green energy and sustainability versus practicality, they were not given relevant information such as the number of bottles tossed daily, the quantifiable impact this has on the environment, and the amount of money the school would lose by ceasing to sell water bottles.
 
Moreover, those proposing referenda should research the effects of potential policies before sending them out for approval. For example, would most students actually bring around reusable water bottles? Or would they simply purchase soda at the vending machines and cafes instead, leading to a less healthy campus that has not become any more environmentally friendly? The UC should study related implications like these and offer the results of this analysis to students prior to the vote.
 
While the UC does publish pro and con statements regarding each referendum proposal, the statements are limited in length and generally not expected to have detailed statistical analysis. As such, though the information is beneficial, most statements are phrased more as abstract arguments than as detailed cost-benefit analyses and consequently still fail to provide an adequate amount of information to the voters.
 
If the UC were to give students the statistics and history before the vote, it is possible that students would choose differently, more in accordance with what they believe to be practical than what they support on an abstract, idealistic level. Additionally, perhaps other students would be motivated to vote, as they would see the referenda as more legitimate and important.
 
Regardless of whether additional information would ultimately have an impact on the results, the UC would still be able to more state with real authority that their new policies reflect the well-informed opinions of the student body.
 
This change would benefit the UC in its presentation of these policies to the administration. It would provide the currently lacking sense of legitimacy to the administration, indicating a clear student voice in demanding policy implementation or change. The administration is much more likely to address a demonstration of a detailed cost-benefit analysis coupled with a practical and possible policy proposal than it is seriously to consider a single-sentence statement of support.
 
Indeed, it is often the most researched policy proposals that the administration gives the most deference. The question of divestment (voted on as a referendum last year), for instance, was one of the most deeply researched, with detailed plans and considerations on the movement’s website. And while President Faust did not agree to divest, she did directly respond to the movement in an unprecedented official statement.
 
This is not to say that the administration will necessarily ignore referenda that do not come with detailed analyses. However, failing to create an implementable policy proposal does leave Harvard’s leadership with an easy way out by enabling them to simply state that the referendum need more analysis prior to its transformation into policy.  In fact, just last year, then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds expressed that “the referendum questions need a great deal of further study” in response to the demand for sexual assault policy change. Such an avoidance of the topic would not have been as easy if a detailed plan had been ready to be put into place.
 
Simply put, referenda reform would go a long way toward increasing student influence in the way Harvard is run. Fleshing out our referenda questions is an easy fix that could have substantial implications for those seeking to change Harvard for the better.

College students and Cabot House residents in particular expressed enthusiasm, support, and optimism for Rakesh Khurana Wednesday afternoon, hours after the Cabot co-master was named the next dean of Harvard College.
“I was ecstatic,” said Emily C. Lowe ’14, a resident of Cabot, where Khurana and his wife, Stephanie R. Khurana, have served as co-masters since 2010.
Lowe was not alone in her excitement.
“Rakesh is the man,” said Bryan Li ’15, another Cabot resident and a Crimson multimedia editor.
“He has our full confidence,” said Adam J. Joseph ’15, a psychology concentrator in the House. “I think that Harvard College is in good hands, and that Rakesh has been an excellent House Master.”
The appointment, news of which came in an email from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith around 1 p.m., will make Khurana the third dean of the College in a little over a year. Though preceded by Interim Dean Donald H. Pfister, Khurana will be the permanent replacement for Evelynn M. Hammonds, who resigned the University Hall post after 5 years last summer.
A number of students interviewed Wednesday expressed confidence that Khurana would bring positive change to the deanship, bringing the College administration—thought by many to have been aloof under Hammonds—closer to the student body.
“We knew Evelynn Hammonds was dean of the College, but I don’t think I saw her other than Convocation freshman year,” Lowe said. “With the way I’ve seen Rakesh approach being House master, I think not only will the dean of the College be more visible but also be more approachable at the same time.”
Former Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer '14, who worked closely with both Hammonds and Pfister during her tenure, said that she is "extremely excited” about the appointment.
Khurana "understands and empathizes with the student body,” she said, and has been "willing to engage with undergraduates."
“I think that there will definitely be a different flavor around,” said Kat M. Baus ’15, who transferred to Currier this year from Cabot. “It does change the sort of character of the school and how students view the administration’s personality.”
Many Cabot residents offered praise for their House master, who will stay on after he takes office on July 1, saying that Khurana had fostered a sense of community within Cabot and would surely thrive in his new position.
“I don’t think it will take away too much from Rakesh’s ability to know how the students are doing and really be personally invested in Cabot,” Kent W. Toland ’14 said. “It’s just so evident that he really cares; he and Stephanie both really care about the students here, and I’m sure that won’t change.”
Toland said that Khurana demonstrated his dedication last year when he personally drove Toland to Inman Square to pick up T-shirts for the Cabot House Musical last year.
“One of my big things that I’ve been involved in here is theater and the Cabot House Musical, and I appreciate how Rakesh and Stephanie don’t just take a back seat in supporting it; they’re very much involved,” he said.
Still, other undergraduates remained less convinced of the importance of the College deanship. Indeed, during the search process last fall, few students attended a series of discussions held by the search committee.
“I feel like it doesn’t really affect my life on campus that much” Kasina Euchukanonchai ’15 said.
Khurana himself was not on campus Wednesday. He was in Davos, Switzerland when the announcement was made, leading a panel at the World Economic Forum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy has chosen four journalists to be Joan Shorenstein Fellows for the upcoming semester, the center announced Tuesday.
The fellows—CNN correspondent Jill Dougherty, business journalist Robert Lenzner ’57, author Diane McWhorter, and former Nieman Fellow and magazine writer Steve Oney—will spend the semester researching and writing a paper on a topic of their choice.
“I think they are superb,” Shorenstein Center Director Alex S. Jones said. “They come from a variety of different places, backgrounds, and interests.”
 
A former business manager of The Crimson, Lenzner has been an editor for Forbes Media for the past 22 years. He has also written for the Boston Globe and the Economist and previously worked on Wall Street for almost a decade.
During the upcoming semester, Lenzner said he plans to assess how the media covered the issues leading up to the financial crisis and its aftermath today. 
“[The financial crisis] is the most important event in financial history, and it has tremendous ramifications for everybody,” Lenzner said. “Even though we’ve made some improvements…it’s still a perilous situation. I’m trying to look at how good of a job did the media do in holding the hands of 350 million people.”
Dougherty has worked for CNN for 30 years as U.S. affairs editor for CNN International, Moscow bureau chief, White House Correspondent, and most recently foreign affairs correspondent. 
“I work in TV on tight deadlines, and we have to get things done immediately, and just to have that ability to just wrap my mind around something is very exciting,” Dougherty said.
Dougherty has followed the Russian media very closely throughout her career, she said, and as a fellow, she plans to conduct research on the relationship between the Russian government and media.
Other Shorenstein fellows include Oney, a former Neimen fellow who has contributed to Playboy, The New York Times, and Esquire, will study former NPR programming director Bill Siemering and his relationship with American broadcasting. McWhorter, a Pulitzer Prize winning non-fiction writer and contributor to the New York Times, will conduct workshops on opinion writing. 
McWhorter and Oney could not be reached for comment.
 
The Shorenstein Center has funded semester-long research projects for journalists and scholars in media or politics since 1986, according to the Shorenstein Center website. A $5 million gift last fall allowed the center to expand its focus and add a new fellowship, while it also changed its name to reflect the new mission.
Jones emphasized the dual mission of the program. 
“[Fellows] are here to do pieces of serious work that are published,” he said. “However, there is another mission. They create a community that makes them accessible to Harvard students.”

Cabot House Co-Master Rakesh Khurana, who will assume the position of Dean of the College this summer, will bring leadership expertise from Harvard Business School and insider experience of House life to one of the University’s highest offices, colleagues and students say.
Born in India and raised in Queens, Khurana will be the first dean of the College who is of Indian descent when he officially takes the post on July 1, more than a year after former dean Evelynn M. Hammonds announced she would resign. His expected deanship comes after two decades at Harvard, where Khurana has filled a number of roles ranging from student to professor to House master—and now, the College’s top administrator.
A professor with a joint-appointment at the Business School and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, he took the reins of Cabot House with his wife, Stephanie R. Khurana, in 2010, approaching the role with an entrepreneurial mindset. Since then, Khurana’s campus profile has grown as he has voiced his opinion both formally and informally on hot-button College issues such as alcohol policy, academic integrity, and Greek life.
Now, a scholar known for his work on leadership and organizational management will be leading Harvard’s flagship school.
Students across the Charles River in Allston describe Khurana as a compassionate instructor devoted to all aspects of student life, while colleagues, who say that the professor possesses commendable leadership skills, say that they expect him to shape life at College for the better, even as his goals remain unknown.
PRACTICING WHAT HE TEACHES
The incoming dean will arrive at the first floor of University Hall as a seasoned academic who has established a career through sociology-driven research on leadership practices and organizational management, studying and teaching skills that may prove useful in his new job.
Majoring in economics and industrial labor relations at Cornell University, Khurana headed to Harvard after college, earning a Master’s degree in sociology at the University in 1997 and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior a year later. Following a short stint as an assistant professor of management at MIT, Khurana accepted a teaching position at Harvard Business School in 2000. He taught in the school’s business administration program and became a tenured professor in 2008.
Joseph L. Bower, a professor at the Business School who has known Khurana since he was a Ph.D. student, said he expects that Khurana’s scholarship will inform him in his new role.
“When you build courses on leadership, what you’re trying to do is help people think through what it means to work with other people and get them to work together to accomplish something,” Bower said.
Khurana has published books and journal articles on various topics, including the theoretical basis for leadership studies and the pitfalls of charismatic leadership in the corporate world. He serves as the course chair for the Leadership and Organizational Behavior course at the Business School that is required of all first-year students.
“It's interesting that he not only teaches leadership, but he practices it too,” said Ranjay Gulati, the unit head of the Business School’s Organizational Behavior Department in which Khurana is a faculty member. “His work really spans theory and practice really makes him an exceptional person for the position he has been put in.”
Winthrop House tutor Sanjey Sivanesan, who took one of Khurana’s courses last semester, said that in class, Khurana emphasized that effective leadership requires an understanding of organizational culture.
“The biggest takeaway was just that the culture is really really important,” he said, adding that Khurana stressed that “setting the tone from the top is what dictates how organizations are run.”
‘A LOVING LEADER’
Back across the river at Cabot House, Khurana has established a reputation as an empathetic House master invested in all aspects of students lives, affiliates there say.
Cabot House tutors said that they view Khurana as an open-minded and caring House master.
“He emphasizes community needs,” Maryam M. Gharavi, a tutor in the House who interviewed Khurana during the masters selection process, wrote in an email to The Crimson. “He stresses care and attention to the whole student.”
Gharavi said that Khurana welcomes different perspectives on controversial matters related to student life.
“He doesn't quiet difficult discussion and never makes the people around him feel that they have to dampen who they are outside of their structural roles,” she wrote. “I don't know anyone more dedicated to empowering the whole student than Rakesh Khurana.”
Aron Zingman, another Cabot tutor, wrote in an email that Khurana is “the best boss you could hope for.”
“He inspires people and makes them feel accomplished through the work [they] do with his support,” Zingman wrote.
Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, an Adams House tutor who has worked with Khurana and has taken his class, called the incoming dean “warm and fuzzy.”
“He’s a loving leader in the sense that he’s someone who leads with emotion,” Ayogu said, adding that Khurana “puts students first.”
“He’s very interested in people as people,” he said.
Khurana’s colleagues echoed these sentiments of his approach to student life.
“As a House master, the amount of caring and purpose he brings is extraordinary,” Gulati said.
 
UNDETERMINED AGENDA
Though he has not yet determined his goals for the deanship, Khurana has been a vocal participant in discussions on a range of issues that fall under the purview of the dean of the College and colleagues say they are optimistic about his future in University Hall.
 
In 2010, he chaired of a committee composed of students and administrators to review the College’s alcohol policy, helping to inform a new set of guidelines designed to standardize rules across the College. Khurana told The Crimson last spring that the policy was designed to accommodate the different uses of alcohol between upperclassmen and freshmen instead of a “one size fits all” solution.
Khurana also has served on the Academic Integrity Committee, which first convened in 2010, but has accelerated its work, including efforts to establish an honor code, since the Government 1310 cheating scandal. A subcommittee began drafting an honor code in October and was expected to undergo review by the entire committee before going on for formal approval.
Khurana has also advocated against Greek life in favor of house community, echoing the administration’s decades-long refusal to recognize sororities, fraternities, and final clubs.
“I’m always suspicious of a club that builds itself on gendered exclusivity,” Khurana told the Crimson in 2011. “It’s so much easier to hang out with people who remind you of your favorite person—yourself—than it is to figure out how to create an organic real community that has strength in its diversity.”
Yet the exact initiatives and priorities that Khurana will undertake as dean are yet to be determined. In a phone interview Wednesday, Khurana did not specify what issues or policies he might focus on, saying he would "have to have a sense of where different issues are."
Still, his colleagues said they are confident in Khurana’s commitment to bringing an open mind to the office.
 
Former Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, who co-chaired the alcohol policy committee with Khurana, wrote in an email that the incoming dean “has a wonderfully collaborative leadership style, listens well, and cares deeply about the student experience.”
 
Others described the incoming dean’s leadership style as transparent and rational.
 
"[He is] the sort of person I think we need as Dean of the College," said Classics professor Richard F. Thomas. “He seems to be somebody who listens, who forms his views according to the evidence.”
 
Gulati, too, said that he thinks Khurana would excel in his new role.
 
"With passion and purpose, there's nothing that you cannot get done," Gulati said. “He brings a tremendous can-do spirit.”

UPDATED: January 23, 2014, at 9:35 p.m.
Neil Patrick Harris, award-winning actor and star of the hit television series “How I Met Your Mother,” was named the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year Thursday morning.
Harris, the winner of several Emmy awards, has appeared in a slew of productions on Broadway and on-screen, including the television show “Glee” and movies such as the “Harold and Kumar” series and “The Smurfs.” Harris is also the four-time host of the Tony Awards.
He will be honored on February 7 with a celebratory roast at Farkas Hall after which Harris will receive his “Pudding Pot.” Following the ceremony, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals will premiere its 166th production, “Victorian Secrets.” The production will run six days a week in Cambridge through March 9.
Harris joins Academy Award-winning actress Helen Mirren, who was named the 2014 Woman of the Year by the organization. Mirren will be honored by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals on January 30 with a parade through Harvard Square and a roast of her own.
“I assume this is for that pudding wrestling competition I won last April...right?” Harris said in a press release issued by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. “It was dark and seemed quite seedy at the time—I'm stoked that it's connected with Harvard. Fancy! Can’t wait!”
President of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Tony T. Oblen ’14 said that members of the organization were pleased to honor Harris’ contributions to the arts industry.
 
“With his enviable reputation as a host and showman, we look forward to hosting Mr. Harris for an entertaining and unforgettable evening to recognize his achievements,” Oblen said in the release.
Oblen later said in an interview with The Crimson that the Hasty Pudding Theatricals selected Harris beacuse of his high profile in the world of entertainment.
“We look for individuals who have made a lasting impact to the world of acting, and given Mr. Harris’s accomplishments in film, on television, and on the Broadway stage, he’s a perfect candidate for the award,” Oblen said. “Mr. Harris has quite an expansive list of accomplishments and we expect that list to grow in the upcoming years.”
Harris follows in the footsteps of many actors who have been given the award since it was first presented in 1967, including Kiefer Sutherland, Justin Timberlake, Bruce Willis, Tom Hanks, Sylvester Stallone, and James Franco.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team knew it would be tested against top-tier opponents at the Indiana University Winter Invite. And by the final doubles bout of the three-day tournament, a finale that saw captain Hannah Morrill and freshman June Lee defeat their Oregon opponents, 7-6 (9-7), the squad had more than met its match.
“I think the team did really well as a whole,” Lee said. “We’ve been playing well because we’ve been practicing hard, and we’re getting closer as a team.”
Though host and 41st ranked Indiana dominated on both the doubles and singles sides and finished with a 32-7 match record for the weekend, the 68th ranked Crimson hung tough throughout with other non-conference opponents. Besides the Hoosiers, the round robin style tournament featured 71st ranked Oregon, Abilene Christian, and Marquette.
“It was really exciting since we did well, and we got to see how [teams like Indiana] play considering their ranking,” Lee said. “It gives us motivation and encouragement to keep working and keep improving. We were right there with them.”
After going an undefeated 6-0 at the Harvard Invitational in November, Morrill nearly duplicated the effort at Bloomington, Ind. Morrill paired with freshman Monica Lin to defeat an Indiana duo on Sunday, 6-3, and won another doubles match against Marquette, 7-5. The Crimson pair fell for the first time this year in the next match against another Indiana doubles team. The captain switched things up a bit on Monday, pairing with Lee to win the nail-biter against Oregon in the tournament’s final match.
Harvard finished 7-8 overall on the weekend in doubles matches. The 34th ranked doubles pair of freshmen Spencer Liang and Monica Lin knocked off Oregon’s Nicole Long and Jasmine Minor, 6-2, on Monday afternoon.
The afternoon prior, Liang and Lee had joined to beat the Marquette duo of Vanessa Foltinger and Ana Pimienta.
In the first event of the 2014 season, the Crimson brought eight singles players to Indiana and left with both eight wins and eight losses.
Only Morrill managed to win both of her singles matches, defeating Indiana’s 118th ranked Gabby Rubenstein, 2-6, 6-4, 2-0 (10-5), on the first day of the event. The next morning, the senior hailing from Twickenham, England edged the Golden Eagle’s Vanessa Foltinger, 7-5, 6-3.
“Hannah was on fire this weekend,” Lee said. “She really stayed collected on the court and fought her way through every match.”
Besides Morrill, Lee, junior Sylvia Li, and freshman Danielle Mirda recorded victories for Harvard on Saturday afternoon, with Mirda rallying to beat the Wildcats’ Emily Conrad, 4-6, 6-4, 1-0 (10-8). Earlier in day, Li had beaten her Marquette opponent, 6-2, 6-4.
“I felt [the weekend] was really good practice for doubles and singles,” Li said. “I hadn’t faced an opponent from a different school in awhile…. I definitely hope in the next few weeks I can use [this] as a good baseline, but I definitely want to improve from there.”
With Mirda’s tough win and Li’s straight set victory, the Crimson managed a 4-4 record on Saturday, and each of Harvard’s losses was in straight sets. Both sophomore Amanda Lin and Monica Lin fell to Oregon opponents in straight sets, Amanda 6-4, 6-4, and Monica 6-1, 6-1.
Sunday morning saw the same 4-4 overall finish, but the losses were much closer the second time around. Lee turned her game up in the second set against the Hoosiers’ Carolyn Chupa, but the freshman came up just short, falling 6-1, 7-6 (7). Sophomore Amy He won her first set against her Oregon opponent, Sofia Hager, but lost the next two, 6-2, 1-0 (10-5).
After a loss on day one, Liang bounced back with a 6-1, 6-2 trouncing of the Ducks’ Minor, and Amanda Lin did the same, beating the Golden Eagle’s Erin Gebes, 6-4, 7-6 (1).
Having participated in only invites and championships in the fall, the Crimson still do not have a record. The squad travels to Gainesville, FL this weekend for the ITA Kickoff weekend before beginning dual meet competition in February.
“Even though [this weekend] was individual, and all the other events in the future are going to be dual, it’s still important that we get the match experience,” Li said. “[The rules] are changed a bit [in individual tournaments], so it was good to get experience with that before we have to jump straight into dual matches.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Welcome to DONATO!—the official trivia show of Harvard men’s hockey. Your first and only question is the following: Of the Crimson’s last 30 goals, how many were scored by underclassmen?”
A. 18
B. 23
C. 27
“C? Is that your final answer? Okay, you’re locked in. Vanna, show us the answer… Aaaand it’s C! Congratulations, Harvard fan! You win absolutely NOTHING!”
***
The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-10-3, 2-8-3 ECAC) may not have its own trivia show, but the Bright-Landry Hockey Center jumbotron featured a question similar to the one above during an early stoppage of play in Friday night’s Cornell game. The answer was indeed C—Harvard underclassmen had scored 27 or the Crimson’s last 30 goals heading into this past weekend, and Harvard bumped that stat up to 31 of the last 34 after a 3-2 loss to the Big Red on Friday and a 4-2 loss to Colgate on Saturday.
The trivia question was a not-so-subtle message for the eight or nine diehard Harvard fans who braved the horde of Cornellians that descended upon Allston on Friday. “Hey, keep your chin up. We just got picked apart by Yale on national television, and we haven’t won a home conference game since All Saints’ Day, but we do have some young studs who are gonna bring us back to the top in a couple years. You just wait.”
The Harvard icemen have passed the halfway point of their conference season, flirting with a repeat performance of their historic finish at the bottom of the ECAC last year. The team’s young offensive core is one of the few positives on which Crimson fans may pin their hopes of a future resurgence. This weekend, Harvard outplayed both Cornell and Colgate in the second and third periods, showing flashes of the team that it could be under the leadership of freshmen centers Sean Malone and Alex Kerfoot as well as sophomore wingers Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo. Harvard currently ranks second among Division I squads this season in goals per game scored by underclassmen.
But a 90 percent underclassman goal rate is not necessarily a stat to celebrate. While the production numbers of the team’s young forwards suggest potential, the figure also points to an unbalanced and one-dimensional attack that may not necessarily improve with experience.
Nobody is surprised that the Crimson’s freshman and sophomore classes are carrying the brunt of Harvard’s offensive production. The squad entered the year with only five upperclassman forwards, and the two most talented of those five—NHL draft picks Colin Blackwell and Petr Placek—will not be lacing up anytime soon. The three upperclassman forwards who remain active have only served in supporting roles.
Harvard’s blue line, on the other hand, has not faced a similar dearth of upperclassman talent this year. Juniors Patrick McNally and Max Everson have served as the team’s starting defensive pair since returning eight games into the season, and captain Dan Ford has played in all 18 games. So far, Harvard defensemen have combined for a Division I-worst two goals and a Division-I-seventh-worst 27 points.
Two goals, 27 points. That wouldn’t be a bad mid-season stat line for graduated Harvard All-American defenseman Danny Biega ’13, who finished the 2011-2012 season with 10 goals and 35 points. Not so good for an entire team. Of course, the first job of defensemen is to, um, defend, but blue liners should be good for about 15 percent of their team’s goals over the course of a season. Crimson defenders have put in 4.5 percent of Harvard’s 44 goals this year.
Biega’s numbers declined precipitously last season as the senior closed out his collegiate career with two goals and 10 points. It was easy enough at the time to attribute his drop off to situational factors like the graduation of dynamic center Alex Killorn ’12 or the unexpected shortage of Crimson defensemen. But in the second straight year of abysmal production from the back line, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 has to be concerned.
In the second half of the season, Donato will have to find new ways to incorporate the Crimson blue line on the attack. Plant big guys like Brian Hart and Kevin Guiltinan in front of the net and have them scrap for every rebound off a McNally slapshot. Defensemen not named Patrick McNally should also not be afraid to let one fly from time to time. Harvard might not have the horses to turn things around this year, but the team cannot just wait for its forwards to grow up.

Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister really understood us. He was there when we were confused about trees, when we needed cupcakes, and even when we just wanted to read a really good book. When he departs in July from his position, Flyby will be here to mourn with you.
Though we are sure future Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana will reach out to the student body in his own way, we will never forget Pfister’s unique way of connecting with us. Whether Pfister will return to the Herbaria has not been announced; perhaps he should consider these alternative jobs around campus for next fall.
 
1. Faculty Advisor of the Harvard Book Club
 
Pfister’s book recommendations inspired students to start reading for fun again. Nothing would provide us greater joy than to see him run his own book club; although, weekly meetings might have to be held in Sanders Theatre due to excessive demand. Harvard could even provide free copies of all of the books (what did you think that the $6.5 billion fundraising campaign was for?).
 
2. Official Harvard Tree Tour Guide
 
Whether or not Pfister should have to comp Crimson Key in order to be an official tree tour guide has not yet been determined. But, it’s a known fact that nothing excites prefrosh more than the beautiful trees of Harvard. Everyone knows that the best indicator of the caliber of a university is its trees.
 
3. Lamont Cupcake Giver
 
Pfister did such a stellar job of handing out cupcakes during finals that he would do well stationed at the entrance of Lamont at all times. Well, maybe not at all times, but definitely every night from the hours of 10 p.m.-2 a.m.
 
4. Flyby Columnist
 
There will surely be Dean Pfister email withdrawal. To remedy this, it is only fitting that he write a weekly column for Flyby. Pfister, have your people call our people. Together, we can make this beautiful venture happen for the Harvard community.
 
  Cherish this semester of Pfister’s emails while you can. And to whoever created Pfister’s Facebook fan page, please continue to keep us updated on his daily thoughts.
