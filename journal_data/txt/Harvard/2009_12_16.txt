After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Faculty of Arts Dean Michael D. Smith announced he would lift the salary freezes placed on faculty and staff last winter by providing two percent merit-based raises to professors and increasing stipends for graduate students by three percent. The Harvard community has not been given a brief on the state of the budget since Sept. 15, so we are unsure of whether the announcement is a sign of budget security or an exception to the FAS policy of late that dictates trimming spending wherever possible. Regardless, Dean Smith’s spending decisions are misdirected. Given the numerous cuts the university has faced since the unfortunate implosion of the economy and subsequent drop in endowment value, several areas of the College need future funds more desperately than professors and graduate students.
We understand the College’s desire, which we share, to attract and retain the best faculty to Harvard in order to protect the quality of research and academics here, and we certainly recognize the value of monetary incentives. That said, we doubt that a modest raise of two percent will do much to keep professors from leaving or spark any noticeable improvements to the Harvard academic experience. Additionally, as one graduate student pointed out, the three percent stipend increase amounts to more funds for groceries but is unlikely to convince anyone to enroll in Harvard’s graduate program. Moreover, we hope that the deciding factor for why one ought to pursue an advance degree at Harvard is something other than the fact that it pays more than at other schools. Professors, moreover, have countless incentives to stay at Harvard besides economic ones.
The announcement that no additional funding will be cut from the Harvard College libraries is great news. We hope that, in the future, funds secured amidst changing budget structures will include similar measures. With any luck, the FAS’s new interest in reinstating secure spending policies will include reabsorbing laid-off staff members or reinstating cut hours as part of an effort to return services to the College and the university as a whole. The funds being directed toward professors and graduate students would conceivably have a bigger impact on the larger Harvard community if applied to initiatives such as bringing back hours in libraries and the Bureau of Study Council, serving hot breakfast, increasing hours for students who hold jobs on campus, and transitioning out of the hour reductions and furloughs many staff members face.
Harvard professors are currently the highest paid in the country, according to a report by the American Association of University Professors. When compounded with the level of prestige attendant to professorship here, most professors are deeply contented to be on the faculty of Harvard University. Similarly, many students are already eager to earn a graduate degree here; providing extra incentives need not be our priority right now. While the goal of preserving the quality of teaching and research at Harvard is an essential one, these raises will have little impact. Instead, Dean Smith should have directed FAS funds toward returning staff and services—spending for which the student benefits are much more certain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1766, before the House system, before “cage-free eggs,” before the very forging of the United States of America, Harvard students rose up to stand against injustice in the dining hall. That year, the dining steward had purchased a full stock of rotten butter and let it further decay before attempting to serve it in the dining commons. In response, a group of students banded together as the “Sons of Harvard,” in the spirit of the recently formed Sons of Liberty, and planned to stand against the administration that had ignored their complaints. Asa Dunbar, later the grandfather of Henry David Thoreau, led the rebellion. On a day when the stench of the butter rose to its peak, he stood in the dining hall and yelled out: “Behold! Our butter stinketh!” Half the college rose with him and, roaring a grand “Huzzah!” of defiance, marched out into the Yard.
It’s time for Harvard students to rise up like our predecessors to protest our modern equivalent—the cuts to hot breakfast. After all, the usurpation of our morning meal has a historical precedent, too. In the late 1970s, the university, facing budget cuts and an oil crisis, stripped students of their dietary rights. But even then, it did so with a few basic provisions to ensur the health, safety, and satisfaction of its students. The administration lowered board costs to reflect the change, and still served hot breakfast during exam period so that students trudging Yardward to take exams under the threat of “incommunicado” imprisonment would at least have warm, wholesome sustenance in their bellies. We remain cold in our early (in fact, 15 minutes earlier than usual) exam period. Despite university claims that cold breakfast would mean lower board costs and better Brain Break, we still peck at our usual bagels while it saves nearly one million dollars. I may study Hist & Lit, but the math just doesn’t work.
Many argue that only a small portion of students even drag themselves from bed, and those who do mostly eat the cold items anyway. However, experts agree that a good breakfast is an extremely important part of a healthful diet, and it should not be the job of the university administration to encourage our bad habits. Nor should we fault the HUDS staff. According to sources within Dining Services, many of the food experts who bring us our daily sustenance hate the halfway breakfast they’re forced to provide.
Maybe Harvard students today have too much else to do or too much to lose. Maybe we just have a stronger stomach for tyranny than our Revolutionary forefathers. The lack of hot breakfast glares as a public symbol that our administration is too careless and too calloused to even keep us fed, that they have hardly progressed since the 1700s. The UC has done nothing, between incendiary e-mails and media stunts for relevance, but found an “Idea Bank” as an “outlet” to silence our concerns. Most of us will just put our heads down and trudge through the cold with them. But if we do, we forsake the memory of the long line of Daughters and Sons of Harvard who have risen to shout against unpalatable oppression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, another nation’s survival was threatened by the existence of the U.S. Senate. Arguing for a stronger climate-change treaty that would save his nation from going underwater, Ian Fry, Tuvalu’s representative to the climate-change negotiations in Copenhagen, placed the blame squarely at the Senate’s feet. “It is an irony of the modern world that the fate of the world is being determined by some senators in the U.S. Congress,” Fry lamented.
It was nice of Fry to single out the Senate, as its actions certainly do not reflect the will of the American people. The House—which, unlike the Senate, gives all citizens equal representation regardless of which state they live in—has already passed cap-and-trade legislation. What’s more, the populations of the states represented by the 45 senators who have already committed to supporting climate-change legislation almost certainly represent more than half the nation’s population, given that opponents of the legislation come disproportionately from small states. America, then, is not dooming Tuvalu. Its upper house of Congress is.
Of course, this is hardly the first time the Senate has tried its best to ruin good legislation. Opposition to the Social Security Act came overwhelming from the Senate Finance Committee, which did its best to turn the act into the stingy—and straight-up racist—bill that was eventually passed. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had to be watered down at the last minute by Senate GOP leader Everett Dirksen and then-Senators Hubert Humphrey and Robert F. Kennedy ’48 in order to avoid a successful filibuster. Then, as now, the structural requirements of the U.S. Senate were the enemies of social progress.
The fact that the Senate has traditionally derailed legislation that I support is, of course, not a good enough reason to abolish it. The fact that it consistently neglects the popular will, however, is. Take the example of the Social Security Act. In 1935, when the bill was being debated, Congressman Ernest Lundeen proposed a far more radical bill, in which all workers, regardless of race or industry, would be provided with generous benefits provided by taxing the incomes and estates of wealthy Americans. The American people strongly supported the Lundeen proposal, with a New York Post poll at the time showing 83 percent preferred it to the Social Security Act. Nevertheless, the Senate ended up passing a far weaker bill than the public wanted.
This should not be surprising. The senate is not set up to account for the popular will, but to resist the passions of voters. James Madison said as much in Federalist No. 63, writing that the Senate would act as “a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions.” This should be offensive to small-d democrats everywhere, but aside from that, Madison’s defense of the Senate fails on its own terms. The Senate blocks not just benefits for the masses, but legislation of all varieties. As Texas law professor Sanford Levinson—currently visiting at Harvard—wrote in his fantastic “Our Undemocratic Constitution,” the continued existence of the Senate agitates not just against the passage of foolish legislation, but of wonderful legislation as well. This is a recipe not for prudence, but for gridlock.
The Senate’s ability to slow legislation is particularly embarrassing in light of the fact that it is nearly unique among modern democracies. Every other developed nation’s upper house of parliament lacks parity with its lower, popularly elected house. Britain’s House of Lords, for instance, has not been on par with the House of Commons at least since 1911, and, in France and Germany, the lower house has the formal ability to assert its supremacy over the upper house in cases of deadlock.
Of course, France and Germany had the ability to formulate completely new constitutions following World War II, and Britain to this day lacks a formal constitution, meaning that gradually weakening the upper house was far more plausible in those nations than in the United States. Indeed, formally weakening the Senate would require constitutional amendment, just the same as abolishing the Senate would.  If our aim is to allow majority rule in Congress, it makes more sense to kill the Senate in one blow than to use the same maneuver to merely weaken it.
To be sure, changes as large as the abolition of a branch of Congress should not be taken lightly. However, an institution like the U.S. Senate whose primary effect is to prevent the federal government from accomplishing anything of significance has clearly overstayed its welcome. If the citizens of the United States care about maintaining a democracy in any sense of the term, it is high time to abolish the Senate.

Re: “Stumping for Stupak”
To the editors:
Mr. Lewine’s arguments against the platform of the Harvard Stop Stupak movement are illogical and unrealistic. I would like to start by addressing his two refutations of the Stop Stupak Amendment.
First, he claims that the amendment “in no way makes abortion illegal.” Perhaps Mr. Lewine is naïve enough to believe that policymakers never try to conceal their agendas in technical wording. The fact that the Stupak-Pitts amendment does not explicitly illegalize abortion means very little when we look at the sector of the population that the amendment will most seriously affect. For the low-income women who have no hope of getting access to supplemental insurance, much less $372, and have not planned their pregnancies, Stupak effectually will render abortion illegal, forcing them to seek illegal, unsafe abortions.  Mr. Lewine also underestimates the difference between splurging on an iPod and paying for an abortion. Having an abortion is not an easy choice, whatever anti-choice proponents might say—even outside of the certainly devastating realization of the gravity of her decision, a woman going through an abortion faces relentless attack, including the onslaught of insults and eggs as she walks to the entrance of a clinic.
As for the supplemental insurance: There won’t be any. While Stupak claims private individuals will be able to purchase a plan that includes abortion—as long as these individuals are not receiving any federal funding or affordability credits—insurance company executives have admitted that with no incentives to provide supplements, they will be “impractical” and unlikely (Jodi Jacobson, RH Reality Check). Insurance companies seem to understand what many Stupak supporters do not: Abortion is a solution for an unplanned pregnancy. President Obama has also indicated that Stupak goes too far (Planned Parenthood).
The claim on our rally fliers that Stupak will force women into unsafe abortions comes from data collected in the U.S. Before abortion was legalized, 1.2 million illegal abortions occurred every year—and, regardless of whether these abortions were sometimes safe, low-income women would almost certainly not have had access to potentially safer abortions that their higher-income counterparts might have chosen. Is Mr. Lewine really trying to argue that simply because illegal activities in developed countries are relatively safe, we don’t need to worry about making a medical procedure accessible legally? Whether abortions are legal or illegal, low-income women will NOT have access to safe abortions unless the federal government makes a commitment to help them.
Mr. Lewine makes an interesting point in his second argument that “if a choice is made based on economic necessity, it is not a real, truly free choice.” Certainly, the choice to have an abortion is often made based on economic necessity. But once the option of abortion is no longer open to a woman, there is no other choice. The natural course of this situation runs inevitably toward childbirth and child-rearing (adoption, if it is an alternative, only becomes one much later; Child-rearing carried out by an adopted mother still occurs after the biological mother has undergone a long, difficult pregnancy).
Let us discuss also the women “for whom the Stupak amendment would make abortions prohibitively expensive.” We are not talking about women with iPods, but rather those whose medical conditions may make pregnancy dangerous, yet not sufficiently life-threatening to warrant insurance; women whose partner relations do not qualify as rape but are almost as far removed from free choice; women who prior to the passage of Roe vs. Wade died every day after botched illegal abortion procedures. For these women, the choice to have an abortion may be the only free choice they are able to make for the sake of their unborn fetuses.
Health care without comprehensive reproductive coverage for women will not be universal. It will be a betrayal of the rights that millions of women currently have to an abortion, and that under Stupak (or Hatch for that matter) will be stripped from them.

CORRECTION APPENDED
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow James R. Houghton ’58, who played a key role in the resignation of former University President Lawrence H. Summers and presided over the appointment of his successor, Drew G. Faust, will leave his post on the University’s top governing board at the end of the current academic year.
Robert D. Reischauer ’63, who joined the Corporation as a fellow in 2002 after concluding his six-year term on the Board of Overseers, will succeed Houghton as senior fellow, according to a University announcement of Houghton’s decision released Monday afternoon.
With nearly a decade and a half of service, Houghton is twice over the most senior member of the Corporation—the six-person body that oversees and advises Harvard’s president. He joined the board in 1995 and became its senior fellow in 2002.
Houghton is also an active member of several boards of directors of various companies, and the current chairman of the board of trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School in 1962, Houghton spent much of his professional career at Corning Incorporated—a maker of specialty glass and ceramics—where he eventually rose to the top posts of chairman and CEO in 1983, and again in 2002.
The senior fellow post—which can be described as the first among equals—differs from that of the Chair of the board, the President, who leads the meetings. But Houghton has been a distinct and important presence in the group: he is responsible for representing all Corporation members on certain occasions and chairs the meetings when the President is absent, wrote Harvard Corporation member Nannerl O. Keohane in an e-mailed statement.
Houghton has also been active in reaching out to members of the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing board, according to Keohane.
“Under his leadership we are meeting with them more often, and learning from each other,” she wrote of her colleague. “This has been an important step, and it owes a lot to Jamie.”
“He has been a first-rate leader and an important voice for the university, and someone who has been concerned about all dimensions of the institution,” Reischauer said in an interview Monday. “I think all of us are deeply grateful for contributions he’s made—not just through the smooth functioning of the Corporation, but to the strength of the University overall.”
Christine M. Heenan, vice president for public affairs and communications, said she believes that there are “no formal rules” regarding the appointment of a senior fellow, though seniority conventionally plays a “primary factor” in these decisions.
“[I]n this case, the members unanimously agreed that Bob Reischauer was the natural choice, given his longevity of service on both the Corporation and the Overseers,” Heenan wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Reischauer, who will be replacing Houghton, was elected to the Board of Overseers in 1996 and served for six years before joining the Corporation. Corporation Fellow Robert E. Rubin ’60—the former Citigroup executive and Secretary of the Treasury—joined the group shortly before Reischauer in 2002. He did not serve previously as an Overseer.
“[H]e will be a terrific contributor and leader as senior fellow,” wrote Rubin of Reischauer in an e-mailed statement, adding that he looks forward to working with Reischauer in his new position.
“I’m honored to be asked to fill this role. The Corporation operates very much as a collegial, non-hierarchical body that governs largely by consensus,” Reischauer said. “As a mere member before this transition takes place, I had the feeling that my voice was important and listened to, and I think all my colleagues would expect that to continue over the course of the ensuing years.”
Reischauer, who will be involved in the search process for the new Corporation member, said it is “premature” for him to have outlined his priorities and goals for his upcoming tenure as Senior Fellow.
Houghton confirmed his plans for departure to his Corporation colleagues at their Dec. 7 gathering, wishing to make his announcement before the end of the month to jump-start the search for a replacement next year, according to the release.
In compliance with the University’s charter, the Corporation elects any new Corporation member with the counsel and approval of the Board of Overseers. A joint committee of the Corporation and the Board will soon begin a search to fill the vacancy to be left by Houghton.
“It’s been a true honor to have been able to serve Harvard over the years,” Houghton is quoted in the release. “I believe that today, under the leadership of our distinguished president and with support from our other constituencies, the future of our ‘fair Harvard’ is bright indeed.”
“I’ve been around Harvard for more than 50 years, through challenge and change, and the wealth of talent in our community never ceases to amaze me,” wrote Houghton, a former Lowell House history concentrator and active undergraduate member of the A.D. final club.
Even before Houghton’s arrival on campus as an undergraduate, his family’s long-standing legacy at the school had already created a visible imprint—reflected prominently in the name of the Houghton Library, the University’s rare book collection. Houghton entered the Business School and completed his MBA in 1962.

CORRECTION
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the subheadline for the Dec. 16 news article "Senior Fellow Leaves Board" incorrectly stated that James R. Houghton '58 would be leaving the Harvard Corporation after a six-year term. In fact, Houghton will have served on the corporation for nearly 15 years when he steps down this spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man holds a sign outside the Harvard Square T-stop offering a “Free Bible Quiz.”
Bruce M. Benson says his objective is not to convert people, but to start conversations with the people he encounters in the Square.
And the Pit, the sunken amphitheater that surrounds the T-stop entrance, seemed the perfect place for interesting encounters.
In the 1960s, he might have run into Bob Dylan or Joan Baez. But in the past twenty years, the Pit has been host to some less glamorous appearances.
Benson, who has lived in Cambridge for 18 years, recalls that in the early 1990s the Pit drew some unsavory characters.
“It was a free–for–all, open air mental institution,” he says.
In the past decade, Cambridge residents have raised concerns about violence and drug use among some frequenters of the Pit.
Still, store owners in Harvard Square say that the vibrance of the Pit is good for business: it sets the Square apart from the rest of Cambridge.
A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE
“Some people are uncomfortable of the gatherings of people there,” says Fred Berman, a planner for the Cambridge Department of Human Services.
“Rough characters” as well as the “transactions that happen outside the law” are a point of concern for some residents, he added.
In September 2000, three undergraduates were attacked by seven people they labeled “intoxicated skinheads,”—allegedly from the Pit—on Mt. Auburn St. The next day, a Muslim undergraduate was attacked on Bow St. as he walked back to his dorm from evening prayers in Canaday. His attackers were also later identified as skinheads who hung out in the Pit. Many in the Harvard community viewed the attack as a hate crime; the Harvard United Ministry organized a silent vigil at Memorial Church, followed by a peace march through the Pit.
But the violence didn’t end there.
In 2001 Io Nachtwey, a homeless woman who hung out at the Pit, was stabbed to death and thrown in the Charles by a gang-like organization from Boston that had recently begun to frequent the Pit.
Finally, in June 2003, three teenagers known to have spent time in the Pit were arrested after stabbing a man in front of Pizzeria Uno.
Residents also raised concerns in the early 2000s that the groups of people constantly congregating in the Pit created a potentially dangerous congestion problem.
In 2007 construction started on the Super Crosswalk Plan as part of the Harvard Square Improvement Project, which extended walking space and subsequently decrease congestion in the Pit. City officials report that there have been fewer complaints since the project was completed in 2008.
AN URBAN STAGE
Designed to facilitate spontaneous community performances, the Pit is much more than just home to the main entrance to the subway. It was built in 1985, at the conclusion of a process to extend the Red Line out to Alewife. Musicians, artists, homeless people, tourists, and protestors are all among the groups that use the space as a public gathering place.
In the 1960s, the Square was an early performing venue for folk singers Baez and Dylan, and the roaming lifestyle of that era has continued to define the Pit.
In the 1980s and ’90s, the Square became a gathering place for the Punk counterculture youth movement.
For $40 per year, performers and protestors—such as the Tibetan monks who often demonstrate there—can obtain licenses to perform in the Pit.
One such performer, Donald Heller of the Hurdy Gurdy Band, has been playing his hurdy gurdy—a type of violin that sounds similar to a bag-pipe­­­—in or around the Pit for the past month.
After playing for two years on the streets of Europe, he and his wife Anicet Heller moved to Boston to be closer to their sons, one of whom goes to the Boston Conservatory of Music. Heller obtained a street performing license and, although it will expire at the end of the year, he said it worth the $40 for the few remaining months.
“It is a comfortable place for buskers [street performers]. That is what keeps me here” said Heller. He said that while the streets of Munich and Berlin have more open space for pedestrians, the Pit and the large sidewalk in front of Crema Cafe are good for performance. He also noted that the provisions that the city makes for performers are attractive to musicians.
“Our street performers are completely organic, there is complete serendipity,” Denise A. Jillson of the Harvard Square Business Association said. “They can show up in the morning and stay as long as they wish.”
GOOD FOR BUSINESS
In 2003, during the planning process for the Harvard Square Improvement Project, a City Council appointed committee concluded that because the  Pit is a visible, public area, it is relatively safe. Furthermore, the committee said, if people were not allowed to hang out there, they might start congregating in less visible areas and could potentially pose a more significant safety issue.
But safety concerns do not appear to weigh heavily on the minds of local business owners.
Rather, business owners were happy to point to the Pit as a source of costumers and a unique aspect of Harvard Square.
Donez J. Cardullo, of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, notes that the Pit adds flavor to the square and without it, “It just wouldn’t be Harvard Square, it’d be Porter Square.”
She says that Cardullo’s has been in the Square for 59 years and the Pit hasn’t affected business and is “not a concern at all.”
Similarly, Chris Kotelly, the owner of Crimson Corner News Stand, which is directly across the street from the Pit, commented that as long as the young people in the Pit do not cause trouble, it is not a problem. He added, “Some of them are our costumers, I respect them.”
Rakesh Kaftey, an employee of Out of Town News also said that the Pit is a source of business, because many people who hang out there come in to buy cigarettes.
The area’s history as a spot for those off the beaten path has kept it a destination for youth and homeless people.
Some come to the Pit for the counterculture scene, while others stop in Cambridge during a longer journey, said Berman.
The Pit is like any popular bar or restaurant, Berman continued, people come because of its reputation.

CORRECTION APPENDED
Cornell University Assistant Professor Sahara Byrne presented audience members with evidence suggesting that internet risk prevention strategies are most likely to be effective when they allow children to take an active role in their own protection.
Byrne, who teaches in the department of communications, spoke at the Berkman Center For Internet & Society at Harvard Law School yesterday afternoon as part of a weekly luncheon series to facilitate the discussion of pressing media issues.
Byrne presented a nationwide survey of parents and children illustrating average levels of support and opposition for various internet protection strategies. She said that disagreements about implementation within a household are triggered by personal characteristics of the parents and children.
“An authoritarian parenting style predicts a lot of disagreements and runs the greatest risk of having a child trying to get around their parents’ strategies,” Byrne said. “Agreement on any [risk prevention] strategy is predicted by households that report pretty good communicative relationships with their children.”
Byrne also noted that an authoritative parenting style develops more trusting relationships between parents and children.
“[These] children would rather talk to their parents about internet safety than have a filter that watches their every move online,” Byrne said.
Byrne said that children’s values and beliefs could also predict resistance to attempts from their parents to protect them on the internet. The strategies resulting in the least amount of disagreement were the most effective because they empowered the youth to protect themselves while providing legal or academic consequences for online misconduct.
The Cyber Safety Campaign developed by Boston Public Schools requires that all teachers become Internet safety certified through i-SAFE, “a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the online experiences of youth everywhere,” according to its Web site.

Lisa M. Coleman, Tufts’ first executive director of institutional diversity, will join Harvard as Chief Diversity Officer on Dec. 30, the University announced last week.
Executive Vice President Katie Lapp expressed enthusiasm yesterday about Coleman’s appointment to the position, which will focus on staff diversity.
“Lisa has a strong background in the theory of diversity of inclusion balanced and [sic] a very pragmatic approach,” wrote Lapp in an e-mailed statement. “She will play a key leadership role at the University.”
She will also serve as special assistant to President Drew G. Faust.
Coleman comes to campus as the University has had mixed success with diversity issues.
Since 2003, the number of female faculty members at Harvard has grown by 16 percent, while the number of minority faculty members has risen 23 percent, according to a recent report.
But that period has also seen a number of high-profile controversies surrounding diversity issues, including the widely reported comments of then-University President Lawrence H. Summers suggesting women might have a lesser aptitude for science and math.
More recently, multiple incidents of alleged racial profiling involving the Harvard University Police prompted University President Drew G. Faust to commission an investigation of the issue last fall.
Tufts President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost and Senior Vice President
Jamshed Bharucha lauded Coleman’s efforts at Tufts in an e-mail to students announcing her departure.
“She has overseen the work of a reinvigorated Office of Equal Opportunity,
launched new programmatic initiatives, and established strong ties between diversity programs across our Schools and administrative divisions,” they wrote.
Prior to her work at the Office of Institutional Diversity, Coleman was the director of the Tufts Africana Center—established to raise awareness of on-campus diversity issues and to provide Tufts students of African descent with resources to prepare them for leadership in professional settings.
Coleman did not return requests for comment for this article.

Sixty-one years after his hallmark book “Economics: An Introductory Analysis” was first published, Paul A. Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel Prize in economics, died in his home on Sunday after a brief illness. He was 94.
Samuelson, who helped to popularize the introduction of Keynesian economics to Americans, attended college at the University of Chicago and was a three-time alumnus of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
He was a member of the Harvard Society of Fellows—a University group aimed to “give men and women at an early stage of their scholarly careers an opportunity to pursue their studies in any department...free from formal requirements,” according to its Web site—before obtaining his professorship at MIT in 1940.
Samuelson was best known for his incorporation of mathematics in understanding economics.
“He was interesting as a kind of mathematical economist because his style was unusual,” said Economics Professor Martin L. Weitzman, a former student and colleague of Samuelson. “He didn’t really prove stuff rigorously, but it was more like a sketch of a proof... He would translate everything to his own image model in his head and into his own terminology.”
Weitzman remembers sitting next to Robert M. Solow ’44, a Nobel laureate compatriot at MIT, when Solow recalled a book he had read several decades ago.
“You seem to remember the title of every book that you’ve ever read,” Weitzman said to Solow.
“That’s true, more or less, but Paul [Samuelson] here remembers what’s in every book he’s ever read,” Solow said.
Weitzman said that Samuelson was just as engaging in a social context.
Weitzman noted that when Samuelson won the Nobel Prize, he was reminded to take his acceptance speech seriously.
“He was prone to tell stories and became too entertaining sometimes,” Weitzman said.
In addition to his academic achievements and social charisma, Samuelson’s colleagues remember his care toward his students, despite his high-profile reputation.
“He was one of the most generous persons I knew in the economics profession and in his attitude toward younger economists,” said Economics Professor Benjamin M. Friedman ’66. “He always went out of his way to be encouraging, to tell people how much he liked what they were doing.”
Friedman added, “People who did not know Samuelson personally will miss his steady flow of important creative ideas.”
In 1979, Samuelson published a research paper in the Journal of Banking and Finance entitled “Why We Should Not Make Mean Log of Wealth Big Though Years to Act Are Long.”
The entire article, as the title suggests, was written using only words that were one syllable long, except the last word, which was “syllable.”
“It’s just no other economist had such a combination,” said Weitzman. “You’re not going see the likes of him again soon.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith delivered a notably optimistic financial outlook for FAS yesterday, though the University’s largest school faced a projected $110 million annual deficit as of Sept. 15.
“I believe we are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel,” Smith said at yesterday’s Faculty meeting. “We are not done by any means yet, but it is also a start to resolve some of these questions and theoretically give some comfort to people about the direction of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.”
Meanwhile, University Provost Steven E. Hyman sought to alleviate some professors’ concerns that the Task Force on University Libraries—which released a wide-ranging blueprint for overhauling Harvard’s library system in November—is focused on change solely in the context of cutting costs.
Hyman, who usually sits quietly at Faculty meetings, found himself fielding several questions from professors yesterday about potential changes to the library system.
He defended the report’s timing, explaining that redesigning the library’s “labyrinthine” administrative system has been a topic of discussion at Harvard for over a decade and was not triggered by the recent financial crisis.
Smith said that discussions surrounding the new faculty retirement package—which was announced earlier this month as an option for professors over 65 at several schools across the University—have been in the works since he became dean in 2007.
But for all the rhetoric about an improving fiscal climate, many of the changes mentioned at yesterday’s Faculty meeting—such as the faculty retirement package and a potential overhaul of the library system—were connected to streamlining budgets.
A HARVARD PROFESSOR IN LOEB HOUSE?
Following recent news that Senior Fellow James R. Houghton ’58 has chosen to step down from the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—Reverend Peter J. Gomes suggested that a Harvard faculty member should fill in the opening.
A Harvard professor has not held a seat on the six-member committee since former University President Derek C. Bok appointed former Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky in 1987 and Reverend Peter J. Gomes suggested that the vacancy on the Corporation could be an opportune moment for change.
“Most of us felt that we were well served by having a former professor on the Corporation,” Gomes said. “The Corporation can be a distant and disengaged body... If we ignore them, they will ignore us, and we can’t have that.”
University President Drew G. Faust asked professors to send their nominations for candidates to fill the Corporation’s newly open seat to corporationsearch@harvard.edu.
1-2-3, CHECK, CHECK
Evoking the difficulty that Smith encountered at a Faculty meeting last December where he had trouble launching a slideshow on the FAS financial crisis, Faust herself struggled with technology during yesterday’s meeting.
As she approached the microphone to award honorary degrees to recently tenured professors who do not already possess a Harvard degree, Faust realized that the stand supporting the microphone was too short for her. She attempted to adjust its height, but it did not budge.
“I give up,” Faust said, fiddling with the microphone’s knobs as faculty members chuckled. “I should have just called on the faculty from the School of Engineering [and Applied Sciences].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male law school student was the victim of an armed robbery near Porter Square on Sunday at approximately 4:22 a.m., according to a Harvard Police e-mail advisory sent yesterday afternoon.
The student was heading down Massachusetts Avenue toward Garfield Street when two black males, approximately ages 18-20, confronted him and asked him for a dollar, said the report.
The student told the Cambridge Police Department that the suspects then demanded his wallet and pointed what he believed to be a gun to his stomach.
The first suspect then pointed the gun at the student’s back after the student asked if the weapon was indeed a gun, according to the write-up. The second suspect then told the first to grab the student’s iPod. The two then took off in a tan SUV down Massachusetts Avenue toward Harvard Square.
Though three credit cards, a driver license, and $60 were allegedly stolen from him, the victim was uninjured, the police report stated.
Because the incident did not take place on Harvard property, the Cambridge Police Department is continuing the investigation.
In yesterday’s e-mail, HUPD advised that students, faculty, and staff be careful while walking throughout campus and surrounding areas. The e-mail also suggested that pedestrians avoid “talking on cell phones, listening to music, or walking too close to persons unnecessarily,” in addition to walking with others and utilizing the shuttle bus whenever possible.
This is the third street robbery and second armed street robbery reported by HUPD in the Harvard area since the beginning of this semester, according to its online advisory archive.
Street robberies in Cambridge increased by 33 percent the first nine months of this year compared to the same period in 2008, according to CPD’s third quarter crime report for 2009. Eleven street robberies during the third quarter resulted in arrests. Portable electronics, particularly high-end cell phones, have been the main targets, the report states.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Steven E. Hyman sought to reassure faculty members yesterday that the newly appointed committee for library changes would not overstep its bounds.
Hyman explained that establishing intellectual priorities for acquisitions would not be under the purview of the Implementation Work Group—an administrative body focused primarily on restructuring the administration of Harvard’s libraries.
“This committee isn’t going to decide that we should subscribe to this book and not that book, or this journal and that journal,” Hyman said, drawing the distinction between what he considers to be an intellectual decision as opposed to an administrative one. “But it is very important that we aggregate our buying power when we negotiate with journal publishers.”
Hyman used negotiating with academic journals as an example of the type of administrative action that the Implementation Work Group has the authority to undertake.
Hyman announced the membership of the implementation committee last month in an e-mail containing the University Library Task Force report. The committee is charged with putting in place the recommendations of the University Library Task Force report published last month.
Eight out of nine of the committee’s members are administrators—though the chair is Divinity School Professor David C. Lamberth.
The other eight members of the University-wide implementation committee are Harvard College Library Director Nancy M. Cline, Harvard University Library Director Robert C. Darnton ’60, Harvard Kennedy School Executive Dean John A. Haigh, Harvard Business School library administrator Mary Lee Kennedy, FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, Harvard Medical School Dean for Operations and Business Affairs Richard Mills, and Harvard Law School library vice dean John G. Palfrey ’94.
The Task Force, formed last spring as the University sought to respond to an unprecedented 30 percent drop in its endowment, wrote in their report that the University could no longer hope for a completely comprehensive collection and recommended that the sprawling library system streamline its administrative structure.
But two weeks ago, over 100 professors signed a letter to University administrators expressing concerns about the library’s diminishing acquisitions. The letter was addressed to University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Steven E. Hyman and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, who were all in attendance yesterday.
History of Art and Architecture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger—a co-author of the letter—expressed concerns about the lack of professors on the implementation committee.
“I fear that there is something absurd about a faculty member repeatedly getting up to defend Harvard’s library,” said Hamburger, an outspoken regular about the libraries at Faculty meetings. “If the Library is the heart of the University or at least one of its vital organs, then we have to imagine that the patient is in critical condition and intensive care.”
But Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas, another co-author of the letter, said that he was less concerned that the committee is dominated by administrators.
“I’m not sure if adding a faculty member to a committee such as this makes sense,” he said. Instead, he said, he would prefer reassurance from the committee that the libraries would remain committed to acquisitions.
Hyman emphasized that the implementation group was formed to reallocate funds rather than cut spending.
“The goal is not to squeeze money out but to make the library as effective as possible,” he said.
Responding to concerns of competition from libraries at peer institutions, Hyman said that he also had a competitive side. He reaffirmed that the University’s goal is “to make sure that we as a university have without question the best university library in the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chairman of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who in February was found guilty of workplace hostility in a $1.6 million sex discrimination lawsuit, will resign from his position at the end of the month.
The resignation of Arthur L. Day, who has served as chair of neurosurgery at the Harvard affiliate since July 2007, was announced in an e-mail to the hospital’s community Monday.
“A decision like this is never an easy one,” Day wrote in an e-mail to his department. “In each of our lives, we reach a crossroad—a time for transition—to pursue other opportunities.” The e-mail did not give a specific reason for his departure.
Day could not be reached for comment for this story.
Sagun Tuli, the plaintiff and the hospital’s first female spine neurosurgeon, was granted $1.6 million by a jury in Feb. 2009 after refusing an earlier settlement with Brigham and Women’s.
The award included $1 million for a hostile work environment under Day  and $600,000 for damages incurred from hospital retaliation when Tuli voiced her concerns.
The hospital was found not guilty on charges of pay, research, and promotion discrimination, and was also found not guilty of discriminatory intent during an employee evaluation.
The suit began in Dec. 2007, just months into Day’s tenure as department chair, when Tuli filed an injunction after a hospital credentials committee that included Day threatened that her credentials would be revoked unless she agreed to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
The court granted the injunction and allowed Tuli to retain her credentials without receiving psychiatric evaluation.
A. John Popp—who currently serves as program director for the neurosurgery residency program at Children’s Hospital Boston, Brigham and Women’s, and Harvard Medical School—will become chair of the neurosurgery department in January.
Hospital spokesman Kevin Myron wrote in an e-mailed statement yesterday that under Popp’s leadership, the hospital hopes “to continue to build on a department whose future holds a bountiful promise to make a difference in the lives of those who depend on us.”

What does a typical fight at Princeton look like? Maybe some catcalling about the other guy's hedge fund? Some Merlot-splashing on each other's monocles? Then, just when they're both about to start crying, their butlers are summoned to poke each other with diamond-studded canes?
Believe it or not, Princeton kids actually fight with their fists, at least according to this Daily Princetonian article. Apparently, some "pushing, shoving, and punching" led to what Princeton U. Deputy Chief of Public Safety Charles W. Davall called "jeopardy of significant harm." It got so bad that the cops ended up spraying pepper spray to disperse the crowd.
Find out more about this New-Jersey-gone-New-Haven episode after the jump.
A fight broke out at around 1:20 a.m. two Saturdays ago at a dance hosted by the Princeton Caribbean Connection, a club that promotes Caribbean culture whose Web site still links to "thefacebook.com." Tensions ran high, though we're not sure why (Maybe something to do with hedge funds? Just saying), and around 20 people started trading blows.
The two Public Safety officers at the scene tried to calm the situation, but they couldn't, and it took a Princeton Borough police officer who was in the area to unleash the wrath of pepper spray onto the crowd. Soon, around 24 cops were at the scene to clear the area.
University officials seem to suspect that outsiders were involved with the fight, which makes sense since Princeton kids aren't that good at all things physical. But Associate Dean of Undergraduate Students Thomas Dunne assured the campus that the altercation was a "rare occurrence" that was "an abberation and not the norm at social events sponsored by student organizations."
An hour later, a guy went up to two undergrads and asked them for directions. And then he showed them his penis.
What a weird, weird place.

Have you ever seen a House Master in a polar bear costume pretend to maul some fake Kirkland students? Well, in this post-House Life Survey world, you better be ready for anything.
Last night, this FlyBy correspondent (a resident of Pfoho) was sitting in the dining hall, resigned to the fact that a long, tragic night of panicking and studying lay ahead.
Suddenly, a toga-clad figure (Pfohoser Robert M. Cross ’11) appeared and delivered this oration to the crowd that had gathered below.
“Tonight, I’m here to convey a message of gratitude,” he said. “But more importantly, to convey tidings of a great victory!”
Ah, of course. Pfoho had just won the House Survey Life competition with a 90.7 completion percent, narrowly beating out Kirkland’s 90.2 percent. If exactly two more Kirkland students had completed the survey…well, this might have been a very different sort of night in Pfoho.
Those of you who are not Pfohosers will probably not find Cross’ speech very interesting, but you probably will enjoy watching this.  In “The Hapless Kirklandite,” the skit that followed Cross’ presentation, our House Master Nicholas A. Christakis rushed onto the stage in a polar bear suit and began pseudo-attacking two faux Kirkland students.
Removing his bear head, he then proceeded to read to us the “concession remarks” sent by Kirkland House Masters Tom and Verena Conley. In the second of two e-mails, the Conleys identified, in a photograph, “the two sluggers in their entryway who failed to register opinions.” The ones to blame for Kirkland’s “ignominious defeat”? Max and Jesse, the House dogs. (Christakis’ theory is that Elsa and Rudy, the Pfoho dogs, had “chased them away.”)
Well, what can we say? When it comes to House Life Survey competitions, guess it really is a dog-eat-dog world.

For those who came out of yesterday's Ec 10 final feeling not so hot, know this: the utility of an economics concentration is high.
At least it was for Ben S. Bernanke '75, the Winthrop House economics concentrator who, this morning, was honored by TIME Magazine as 2009's Person of the Year.
In his role as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Bernanke was credited with "creative leadership [that] helped ensure that 2009 was a period of weak recovery rather than catastrophic depression."
The steward of the nation's monetary policy, Bernanke—who went on to earn his doctorate from MIT and teach at Stanford and Princeton—kept interest rates aggressively low in order to stimulate borrowing and lending and expanded the role of the Fed.
At Harvard, according to the article, Bernanke was an "academic star," graduating summa cum laude after discovering "that he could no longer get straight A's without studying." (maybe we should try that....)
Of course, nobody's perfect. And academic stardom aside, the man's Class Day speeches could use some work...
