After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, Harvard is returning to an MBTA far worse than the one they left.
Boston has had a less-than-stellar summer with the T, to put it mildly. Green Line riders trekked through a dark tunnel to the Park Street station after a collision. A commuter rail train struck and killed a man less than two weeks later, the latest in a string of MBTA-related fatalities. On July 21, an Orange Line train approaching Somerville caught fire on a bridge, forcing everyone to evacuate. One woman even jumped out of a window and plunged 30 feet into the Mystic River.
And now, the Orange Line is completely shut down for a month so the agency can comply with the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) four safety directives.
In essence, the MBTA is going through an incredibly rough stretch.
The T has faced controversies before — many of them. But this time feels different.
What makes it different is transit’s place in our current landscape. In the post-lockdown period, the demand for transit is higher than ever. As gas prices rise, interest in taking transit has too. Add to that a looming recession and the growing climate crisis, and you might think transit agencies should be ready to meet the moment. Yet MBTA ridership continues lagging behind other major cities. So why isn’t the MBTA ready?
I’d contend that funding and structure are the two factors preventing the MBTA from succeeding. The MBTA’s budget gap will reach $230 million by 2024, and its governance structure has not effectively responded to the calls for better service. That much has been known for a while.
But also consider who is affected the most by these failures. One-third of Bostonians do not own a car, according to 2020 Census figures, and 29 percent of those who ride the T are low-income as of 2021. During the Orange Line shutdown, disabled riders are facing considerable barriers.
As students, we rely on the T daily to get around the Boston area and explore communities outside the “Harvard bubble.” The MBTA’s systemic faults are harming us more than ever, and as a result, ridership has dampened.
Recognizing these faults, elected officials have called for a close reexamination of the MBTA. Some want to consolidate the MBTA with the state Department of Transportation, ease the hiring process, or temporarily make the T free of charge.
I agree with getting to the bottom of how to fix the MBTA. But between the two previously mentioned factors, I believe it is more vital to fund the system. That is the first and foremost thing officials should do before considering other proposals. Among other things, funding boosts the T’s services, pays employees what they deserve, and shows communities that officials are committed to expanding ways for people to travel.
I am a regular MBTA rider and a supporter of public transit. I believe in transit’s ability to connect a city efficiently and safely — much better than by car. Car dependency is one of the worst factors harming the quality of life in the United States. Its decades-long stranglehold on city planning has destroyed communities, especially those of color, and limited people’s ability to get places.
That is not to say that cars are useless — far from it. But Massachusetts is a state that is centuries older than the private automobile, and it will see the effects of climate change quickly. It is absurd that elected officials prioritize this hazardous and highly polluting approach to mobility.
Additionally, the stigma that transit is inherently unreliable, dangerous, or vagrant undermines real chances for improvement. To reverse these problems, Massachusetts should invest in the MBTA. Investing in transit would better move people between places they want to be, rejuvenate the economy, and connect people across race, class, and ability barriers. Plus, better infrastructure means a better experience. The T should be the first system to support this vision.
What would the MBTA that we deserve look like? As the FTA concluded, the system needs to get two things right: reliability and safety. That means a train that says it will arrive every 5 minutes actually will arrive in 5 minutes. That means ensuring people feel safe taking the T, knowing it will not catch fire. That means stopping criminal activity in and around stations.
These are visions that should unite everyone.
The best thing Harvard students registered to vote in Massachusetts can do right now is to support the Fair Share Amendment. The proposal is a millionaire’s income tax that would reinvest the revenue gained into public transit. The tax would only apply to 0.6 percent of residents but produce a $2 billion investment in transportation.
Currently, the MBTA not only spends about a fifth of its budget on debt servicing but also uses the budget to pay for capital projects. The agency also relies heavily on one-time federal pandemic relief. This spending leaves very little money to provide maintenance or adequate service — and once that federal funding ends, the T will face an even larger financial hole. More funding will not immediately make up for the decades of systemic issues with the MBTA, but it is a desperately needed start.
Public transportation is increasingly becoming integral to city design in other developed countries. There is a growing movement for people to drive less and walk, cycle, or ride a train more. And there is a mountain of real-world evidence that reducing driving by encouraging sustainable, accessible modes of transportation works.
Reliable transit is essential for all cities, and the MBTA should get this right if it aims to be a more valuable service that best serves the needs of residents.
Right now, the MBTA is inspiring confidence in nobody. For that to change, the agency needs funding and support from initiatives like the Fair Share Amendment.
Harvard, let’s work to make sure the T is no longer an embarrassment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cars trudged through hip-level waters as rescue teams searched for survivors. Houses resembled skeletons as roofs and walls lay in the street. Fallen trees littered the ground. Hurricane Maria left millions in Puerto Rico as powerless as they felt, struggling to rebuild without access to electricity and running water.
The death toll: nearly 3,000 people. Nearly a year later, survivors like my grandmother and her neighbors lacked reliable access to electricity. This is a clear manifestation of environmental racism, which refers to practices that disproportionately burden people of color with environmental hazards, and our government is complicit in it.
As the United States continues to experience natural disasters like Hurricane Ida, deadly heatwaves, and the Great Texas Freeze last year, it feels like we’re walking on eggshells as we await the news of the next environmental catastrophe. Even in the absence of these extreme weather phenomena, environmental racism continues to work behind the scenes. Sometimes it’s the cancerous hazard of building oil refineries in predominantly-Black neighborhoods. Other times it’s the lethal disregard for crumbling infrastructure in these communities.
In elementary school, my younger sibling was regularly hospitalized for asthma flareups, trading birthday cakes and dollhouses for IV drips and nebulizers that looked more like creepy breathing machines. Although it felt normal at the time, it wasn’t until recently that I realized how daunting this annual tradition truly was. Asthma is the reality for so many Black children in America that “being Black” was nearly listed as a risk factor for the disease. Compared to their white counterparts, Black children experience asthma at higher rates because they’re more likely to live in polluted neighborhoods. Or rather, Black neighborhoods are more likely to be exposed to pollution with less regard for the well-being of their inhabitants.
To me, it’s clear that climate change and environmental racism have become silent killers of people of color around the world. It wasn’t until this realization that I started to care about environmentalism.
Including social issues in our discussions of climate change cultivates a culture of community-centered care in which members see climate change as a threat to their health and livelihoods and care about it for that reason. By contrast, mainstream environmentalism couldn’t be farther from this. Despite growing concern about climate change among Americans, the movement seems to be highly exclusive, reserved for the richest and whitest. If you don’t buy expensive clothes from slow fashion brands, grow your own vegetables, and bring your metal straw to every restaurant you dine at, you aren’t granted entry. The movement reads more like “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” campaigns, vague global warming claims, and headlines about bird extinctions. It discusses the effects of rising sea levels on animal habitats, not human ones. And in turn, no one feels personally threatened by the one thing that threatens us all.
Community-centered climate care takes us from a cycle of passive caring and wanting to one of acting with accountability. It creates spaces for marginalized groups that have been previously shunned, including low-income, disabled, and racialized communities. It demands that everyone be an environmentalist not only by belief, but by action. Adopting this mindset shifts the blame from the individual to the masses, while still maintaining a personal sense of responsibility.
Many of us at Harvard and similar left-leaning institutions already care about climate change, but we’re trapped in a cycle of talkative inaction. We vote for climate-conscious candidates, but continue to use next-day shipping on Amazon Prime and don’t bat an eye when it comes to our own food waste. Combatting the climate crisis requires cultural shifts and collective action, but we fail to remember that the collective is made up of individuals. Like environmental perfectionists, we’d rather not try at all if we can’t do everything perfectly. We have to start making these changes in our day-to-day lives, no matter how small they seem.
Not everyone is fortunate enough to have the options that Harvard students do: the option to take reliable public transportation, the option to eat plant-based without breaking the bank or traveling far. And depending on where we go home to, those in our own community may not always have these options either. So it’s important that we help set the pace when we can — if not for the bees and orange trees, then for each other.
If places like Puerto Rico are ground zero, then we are ground one. Any of us can be on the frontlines of climate change. And whether you get your turn on the frontlines or not is entirely dependent on the actions you and your communities take today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I recall the nation I was born in, my memories of the brief time I spent there are conjured through rose-tinted glasses. I recall lush fields of green rice paddies, ponds decorated with lily pads and frogs, and trees bursting with fruit. Besides myself, Bangladesh is home to 168 million people — yet the nation was only recently born through blood and struggle over 50 years ago. Now, Bangladesh faces great struggle again.
The majority of the nation sits on the largest river delta in the world, at the confluence of the mighty Ganges, Jamuna, and Meghna Rivers. These rivers are Bangladesh’s lifeblood; they are the waterways that produce the rich agricultural soil that dubs the nation the “Land of Rivers.”
My rose-tinted glasses are gone now. Where there were once rice paddies, there is now just water; where there were once ponds full of life, they are now buried under the currents; and where there was once beautiful agriculture, there is now only erosion and destruction.
The Land of Rivers is quickly becoming the sea, and no one is coming to save it.
Two-thirds of Bangladesh sits at less than 15 feet above sea level. By 2050, one in seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change. This past summer, catastrophic flash floods — the worst in Bangladesh in over a hundred years — barreled through the northeastern region of Sylhet, wiping away towns and affecting around 7.2 million people. Bangladesh is accustomed to torrential downpours during monsoon seasons — yet the globe’s warming climate is quickly lengthening and intensifying the rains and floods, permanently altering the nation’s landscape. Nearly 75 percent of Bangladesh sits below sea level. Erosion from the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna has engulfed 160,000 hectares of land, pushing 300,000 to 400,000 people each year to flee to Dhaka, the country’s capital.
Bangladesh, like many coastal nations, is ground zero for climate change, unjustly bearing the brunt of wealthy nations’ carbon emissions. Despite producing a mere 0.21 percent of global CO2 — leagues below China with 29.2 percent, the U.S. with 14 percent, and Japan with 3.5 percent — Bangladesh is paying the price for these nations in its own lands and livelihoods in what may only be considered an extreme climate injustice.
For wealthier nations, the luxuries of everyday life allow climate change to loom in the distant future. But for Bangladesh, and other nations such as Pakistan, climate change has already claimed the lives of their people, destroyed their homes, and created life-altering cycles of poverty. This year, unprecedented flooding submerged 94 percent of Bangladesh’s Sunamganj town and 84 percent of the surrounding Sylhet district — flooding so terrible it has never been seen in living memory.
My people are resilient and uniquely poised to tackle the issue of climate change with innovative solutions. However, they should not have to face this fight alone while we watch their nation sink from our dry vantage spots in Cambridge. Harvard, with its multibillion-dollar endowment, should publicly address and invest in resources for Bangladeshi flood relief. For Pakistan, student activists from Harvard College Pakistani Students Association have already risen to the fight by raising funds among students; Harvard should provide monetary support for and amplify these voices.
Academia is not apolitical. Harvard has been an architect and endorser of harmful policy and practice. Divestment from fossil fuels, while monumental and significant, was not the clean-cut end of Harvard’s muddy relationship with climate change — not while nations like Bangladesh and Pakistan still reap the effects of decades of fossil fuel pollution. Harvard’s student body is undeniably conscious of the climate crisis and humanitarian crises such as the one in Ukraine — and rightfully so. However, there is a clear bias in whom we choose to show solidarity to. Choosing to center victims who are white is a reflection of Western notions of humanity, and a broader symptom of a Western tendency to disregard Black and Brown bodies in favor of serving the West’s geopolitical interests.
I have a personal confession to make: I cannot swim. This is an oddity for someone born in a tropical country. Back home, my grandmother insisted on carrying all her grandchildren into the ponds, until each child learned the useful life skill of a butterfly or backstroke — all except for me. Instead, I was whisked away to this land, where I have comfortably lived without ever needing to know how to swim.
I still don’t know how to swim. It’s a forgivable privilege here. Students at Harvard swim for fun, to exercise, or in races against other schools — but not to scramble away from the waves consuming their home. Knowing how to swim is not an option for the people of Bangladesh, who must swim for their lives, away from lands wrecked by our ignorance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The only aspect of Harvard that has remained consistently normal over the past two years is the fact that “normalcy” has been thrown out the window. As students, we were insulated from the worst effects of the pandemic — more so than many others who found their health and livelihoods fully undone. But we lived through it, too, and we changed in ways we may never fully be capable of measuring.
In the fall of 2020, freshmen entered dorms and dining halls for the first time as the only class invited back to campus. To compound that isolation, the Class of 2024 was barred from entering many of the physical spaces on campus, from classrooms to study spaces to even the dorm rooms next door. All events — entryway meetings, Crimson Jam, the activities fair, classes — were held online. Normalcy for the Class of 2024 meant matching half-covered faces with names glimpsed from Zoom frames, carving out little moments of human connection in a masked reality of indefinite duration.
The Class of 2023 was a little luckier. Current seniors got to keep their first semester of normal Harvard, though memories of it faded after a year of remote learning and another of masks and Covid-19 restrictions.
The Class of 2025 will get their four full years on campus, even if their first was distorted by limitations on student life.
And now we’ve welcomed the Class of 2026 — the first of our current College generation, if all remains well, to get four normal years at Harvard.
Soon enough, the pandemic’s decisive hold on our daily lives will become a memory, leaving just the strange, one-of-a-kind camaraderie that arose to fill the moments we lost. Each of us has built up a trove of Covid-19 war stories to share amongst friends; our future children will have to suffer through regular retellings of pandemic joys and hardships where the moral of the story — inevitably, annoyingly, hopefully — is that we had it harder than them.
In the meantime, though, we are awash in the tenderness of our return, wandering through a contradiction of loss and joy where everything normal is new.
Imagine you ordered a bunch of packages from your favorite stores — clothes and curios and gifts you dreamt of having for years. But then, out of the blue, every single package was lost, voided, damaged in transit. You learned to accept why. You figured out how to deal with it.
And now, two years later, long after you ordered the packages or even remembered what was in them, they’ve all come flooding back. Each day, you get a new one, a once-treasured trinket that you forgot you’d ever had.
This fall, our packages are returning. We are all a little sad to discover some of the things we missed, like the joyful ambiance of Crimson Jam and the culinary promise of Cabot Cafe. But we’re thrilled, too, at the resurgence of these old traditions, and find ourselves comforted by their quick absorption among members of our youngest class.
In fact, there’s an absurdist joy in seeing the freshmen enjoy opening days as their stereotypical lanyard-wearing and pack-traveling selves, partaking in the debauchery of river parties and Tasty Basement ragers with no regard for the desperate times that spurred these pandemic-era innovations into existence. We watch in wonder as our younger friends live out a freshman year so much richer than ours, enjoying the oblivion of normalcy that is finally ours to share.
Importantly, however, we need not be passive as we process this change; together, we can redefine what is normal, in big ways and small. The end of pandemic-era restrictions means no more mandatory masking, no more shuttered cafes, and — we ask — a return to widespread hot breakfast. But more seriously, it also means keeping our immunocompromised peers top of mind as we strive for a new normal that protects those most vulnerable to Covid-19.
Balancing our competing priorities in a post-Covid world will require grace — with others, when we disagree, and with ourselves when we mess up.
But through it all, packages that we never thought would come will keep arriving. As we open them, let’s savor the absurd joy of a new normal that will only get better as we continue to define it along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Institute of Politics’ John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum typically reserves its stage for heads of state, diplomats, and award-winning journalists while students usually sit in the audience. But on Friday, the roles were reversed.
The IOP hosted its inaugural “Our Narratives” event last week, inviting nine undergraduate students to the stage to tell their own stories about identity and public service and share the lessons they’ve learned from their experiences.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, co-director of diversity and outreach at the IOP, organized and hosted the event which featured Jana Amin ’25, Aaryan G. Morrison ’22, Laila A. Nasher ’25, Jaivyance G. “Jai” Gillard ’25, Ryan Doan-Nguyen ’25, Coby Y. Garcia ’25, Eusung Rhys Moon ’26, Sarosh N. Nagar ’24, and Hana M. Kiros ’22-’23 as speakers.
Ahuja said she organized the IOP’s “Our Narratives” event because it is “vital that we have student voices being amplified in every space.”
“To have the forum stage be a place where students of all identities and backgrounds have this really unique opportunity to tell their stories is something that’s really special and beautiful,” Ahuja said. “It’s a testament to the fact that every single one of us belongs here, that every single one of us deserves to be here, and that none of us are imposters in this space.”
Janna E. Ramadan ’23, president of the IOP, said undergraduates want to see more forums at the IOP featuring their peers, adding that the most well-attended IOP forums last semester either had student moderators or featured young voices.
“For this space to exist is essentially an opportunity for us to learn from one another,” Ramadan said. “We — despite our age, and maybe resume, careers — are public servants and are already entering into that sphere and deserve to be uplifted and recognized for the work that we’re doing.”
Nasher, who is Yemeni-American and grew up in Detroit, spoke about the prevalence of child marriage in her hometown at the event.
“I was 14 years old and had just received my first marriage proposal,” Nasher recalled. “Unfortunately, I was neither the first nor the last young girl to receive a marriage proposal — before me was my mom.”
Nasher said child marriage is an issue that extends beyond Detroit and remains legal in more than 40 U.S. states and across other countries around the world.
“As we sit here today, 650 million girls across the globe were married off as children,” Nasher said. “Child marriage has no race, no religion, and no culture.”
Doan-Nguyen, a Crimson News editor, spoke about how journalists helped him organize one of the first anti-Asian hate protests in the United States in 2021, at a time when hate crimes targeting Asian Americans were on the rise.
“When I reflect on how we were able to do this, I realized that I owe it all to the ones who first shared my story,” Doan-Nguyen said. “Journalism, I’ve come to realize, doesn’t just document history — it creates it.”
Doan-Nguyen said he now hopes to pursue journalism as a career.
“With journalism, stopping Asian hate doesn’t seem all that impossible,” Doan-Nguyen said. “With journalism, you can truly change the world.”

Harvard Square officially welcomed Le Macaron French Pastries in a grand opening event Saturday.
Located on Massachusetts Avenue, Le Macaron is a Black-owned business offering a selection of French macarons and pastries, as well as gelato and European-style coffee. The shop first opened its doors on Aug. 12 during Black Business Month, but held off its official grand opening celebration until nearly a month later.
“We have been just well received by the community, the students, the locals, the Harvard Square Business Association, and particularly the Cambridge Savings Bank,” co-owner Karine Ernest said.
Cambridge City Councilor E. Denise Simmons attended the grand opening. Simmons, the former mayor of Cambridge, spoke at a ribbon-cutting ceremony and congratulated the business on its opening, calling it “a sweet, delightful surprise”.
Ernest called the business her “lifelong dream” during the ceremony.
“Thank you to all those in Harvard Square. Thank you to my friends and family, my children for coming out here to support me,” Ernest said.
David I. Heller ’79, a close friend of the owners who enjoyed a bubblegum macaron, called the establishment a “delicious addition to the Square” and a “nice place on date night.”
Two of Le Macaron’s employees are current Harvard students.
Joseph W. Hernandez ’25, who works at the shop, praised the store’s management, saying he appreciates that “they are willing to hear from the people that are working there.” He called both owners, Karine and Emmanuel Ernest, “nothing but great.”
Le Macaron sits in what was previously an office space for the Cambridge Savings Bank. Karine Ernest called the bank an “incredible partner in this journey” of launching the pastry store.
She also previewed new flavors planned for the holiday season.
“For Christmas, we offer a gingerbread Christmas macaron, and then we also offer, in November, Pumpkin,” she said.
Noting that “it’s taken long” to set up Le Macaron in the Square, Karine Ernest advised other aspiring entrepreneurs to be persistent.
“Never forget your dream and pursue that dream, and don’t be discouraged,” she said. “The whole process may take longer than you anticipated, but if you stick by it, you’ll get there.”
“We are super excited to be in Harvard Square” Enest added. “We love the community, and we’re having fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association convened for its first-ever general meeting Saturday to inaugurate its officers, including co-presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24.
The HUA was established last year after its predecessor, the Harvard Undergraduate Council, was dissolved in a school-wide referendum. The inaugural meeting — convened for less than an hour on the second floor of Harvard’s Smith Campus Center — represented a clear departure from the UC’s history of theatrics.
Whereas the UC’s inaugural meetings typically drew crowds of curious freshman onlookers, the HUA failed to draw the same turnout — or interpersonal drama.
Scattered study groups nearly outnumbered meeting attendees. Background murmurs from problem-setting students accented the officers’ presentations.
Throughout her inaugural address, Estabine, who drew criticism this week for her public defense of a previously sanctioned campus Christian group, cited her faith as a source of inspiration for public service.
Johnson underscored the Association’s infancy and its mandate to revitalize student government at Harvard.
“I want to use this as an opportunity to encourage everyone to embrace change and recognize the historic opportunities we have today to make a difference here on campus,” Johnson said. “Today is our chance to really create a fresh start.”
Residential Life Officer David Y. Zhang ’23 presented the Association’s execution of the longtime summer storage program. Zhang stressed its affordability for students but also expressed concern about the program’s scalability, suggesting the Association could limit the initiative to fewer students or work with multiple moving companies in future iterations.
Later in the meeting, Estabine solicited support for a new HUA initiative to revitalize Declaration Day — the day on which undergraduates declare their concentrations — through the HUA Academics team.
The HUA will continue to convene for a weekly general meeting on Saturdays, while individual committees will meet on independent schedules throughout the week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next month in a high-stakes affirmative action lawsuit brought against Harvard that could end race-conscious college admissions in the United States.
The court will hear two similar lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in one day on Oct. 31 — one against the University of North Carolina and a second against Harvard.
SFFA is asking justices to ban the consideration of race in college admissions, arguing that Harvard and UNC discriminate against Asian American applicants and violate federal law with their race-conscious admissions processes.
The Supreme Court previously agreed to hear the cases jointly, but it separated them in July, allowing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92, who has recused herself from the Harvard case due to her past service on the school’s Board of Overseers, to rule in the UNC case.
The court will hear the case near the beginning of a nine-month term that includes a flurry of major cases on issues including LGBTQ+ rights, redistricting, and elections administration.
Justices will hear the UNC case beginning at 10 a.m. on Oct. 31. The court will hear the Harvard case later that day.
Lawyers representing SFFA will argue first in both cases. The group will have 45 minutes to deliver its arguments in the UNC case and 35 minutes in the Harvard case, consistent with the time the respective schools will have to respond.
In the UNC case, the university, student respondents, and the U.S. solicitor general will all deliver arguments in favor of affirmative action. Harvard lawyers will be joined only by the solicitor general after the court denied a request from 25 Harvard student organizations, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, for ten minutes of oral argument.
In its request for time in the Harvard case, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said justices should hear from student groups because their “very existence … hangs in the balance” with the lawsuit.
“Should Petitioner prevail, many Amici Organizations and their sub-groups would suffer such a sharp decline in their membership ranks that they either would cease to exist or would be so weakened that they could no longer fulfill their missions,” the filing said.
The Supreme Court granted the U.S. solicitor general, Elizabeth B. Prelogar, 15 minutes for oral argument in both cases.

Is this just an excuse to announce that, as of this semester, FlyBy (read: not Flyby Blog) will not, in fact, chastise you for taking one sandwich AND a salad? Maybe. Cheers to being properly fed as we enter this fall! From recruiting to more recruiting, see below for what’s out and what’s in this back-to-school season.
