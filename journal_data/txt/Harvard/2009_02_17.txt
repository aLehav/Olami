After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve still got the acrid taste in your mouth from when gasoline prices were at an all-time high or you’ve fallen victim to a housing “crunch,” the Hasty Pudding Theatricals can offer you laughs (and maybe hope) in the plight of diminutive demigod Hugh Bris (Daniel V. Kroop ’10), the pocket-protected protagonist of their 161st performance, “Acropolis Now.” Though it may not be the high-brow piece of musical mastery that one might typically expect to witness at a show with men in drag, “Acropolis Now,” directed by Tony Parise and showing in the New College Theatre through March 15, has all the great Ancient Greek traditions: prostitution, drinking, and, of course, sexual innuendo. As with many HPT shows, the plot is more a framework in which their punny sex jokes can operate, and the formula works well for them. The show recreates the story of the first Olympics in a town faced with a devastating olive oil crisis and the impending destruction of the Hp (Ate-a-pi) frat house. The ragtag group of townspeople receive the aid of Hugh, who is sent by his rhyme-loving father, Dr. Zeus (Walter B. Klyce ’10), to help the town and earn for himself full divinity. Hugh’s uncle, King of the Underworld and Lord of the Hotpants, Hades (Tom R. Compton ’09), schemes against his nerdy nephew, arranging a competition between Hugh and a really, really ridiculously good-looking statue, resurrected for the purpose. The literal deification of the dork and the lovelorn trials of geeky girl and resident accountant Roseanne (Derek S. Mueller ’10) make for a show that joins frat boys and math puns. Writers Alexandra A. Petri ’10 and Megan L. Amram ’10 opted to limit the offensive one-liners in the all-male Parthenon-era performance to pokes at a capella groups, and the jokes flow unhindered by the cringeworthy jabs that have plagued past HPT performances. But even if Pitches ain’t shit, HPT’s jokes aren’t above falling flat themselves at times. Thankfully, the cast’s rapid-fire, 60-jokes-a-minute barrage keeps the show moving; it’s rare that two duds are ever released in a row. Awkward silences don’t last long, and each of the characters carries an arsenal of witticisms just waiting to be unloaded. David J. Andersson ’09, in ass-flattering sequined bell-bottoms—one of the many striking designs fashioned by Costumer Annie E. Austin ’10—steals much of the show as Afro Dite, the soulfully sassy goddess of Love. Armed with arrows of “Love,” “Like,”  and “I have feelings for you, but I’m just not ready for a committed relationship,” Afro Dite is a punchy shot of attitude; her enthusiasm and the precision with which her particularly round hind region was crafted make it difficult to look at anything else when she’s on-stage. “If he likes dressing up in drag,” she warns in “Venus Envy,” one of the highlights of the show, “he might be gay.” Such selective self-awareness is a powerful comedic weapon in the performance, whose steady supply of double entendres can lull the audience into a slight-chuckle comfort zone. Such surprises are a refreshing source of entertainment, and work particularly well to tactfully name drop the show’s sponsors, particularly The Coop. Similarly, subtlety and careful delivery keep the show from making the jump from shallow to annoying. But the consciously homoerotic humor can be a turn-off in excess, as in the unnecessary number, “A Fine Bromance.” And, though the audience can handle the comedic onslaught, clever lines sometimes get lost amidst the musical commotion. Scenes in which all of the actors are dancing tend to be confused and sloppy, save for the entertaining newborn baby kickline at the end. Supported by the jazzy sounds of composer Alex B. Lipton ’11 and the HPT band, “Acropolis Now” is a rare Greek life spectacle in the generally serious landscape of Harvard theater. In the words of Brometheus, “Pound it.” (That’s what she said.)—Staff writer Beryl C.D. Lipton can be reached at blipton@fas.harvard.edu.

A man in a curled white wig jerks his head, filling the air with dust as he moves. Bubbles spontaneously appear onstage, and the 14 ballet dancers begin to play with them; a woman pops the one in front of her, another tries to gather them in her arms. In “Black and White,” the U.S. premiere of five ballets choreographed by Jirí Kylián between 1986 and 1991, decorum is literally cast off and left excavated on the stage like a mask behind which no face appears. Variations of an elaborate, rigid 18th century dress appear in each of the five ballets: “No More Play,” “Petite Mort,” “Sarabande,” “Falling Angels,” and “Sechs Tänze.” A presence just as prominent as the Boston Ballet dancers, they became the embodiment of Kylián’s social critique.The Wang Theatre’s heavy curtains first opened to reveal a white dress and a male dancer. Amidst a tense silence, a spotlight rested on the ruffled costume. The lighting was simple, a method used by Joop Caboort throughout the show to emphasize the minimalist nature of Kylián’s choreography. A dancer, concealed behind another until this moment, shifted to the right quickly and almost imperceptibility, revealing that there are in fact two. Without regard for a definitive start or end, the curtain then fell, rising again as “No More Play” continued. “Black and White” revels in such play between the evident and the hidden, the proper and the audaciously inappropriate. It is a dark game that questions the relationships we have with others and illuminates the artificial apparatus through which those relationships are mediated.While the “players” in “No More Play” shift constantly between duets and trios, in “Petite Mort”—an established euphemism for “orgasm” in French—the contact between bodies is intimate and pointed. Kees Tjebbes’ costume design is again impeccable. The skin-tight, pink-toned boxers that the six men wear and the similarly colored leotards for the ballerinas harmonize with the soft lighting to render them all naked. Though the elaborate swordplay with which “Petite Mort” starts later seems incongruous, it charges the piece with aggression from the very first slash. The sexual tension continues to grow through the way in which male and female dancers weave their bodies together; at times it is impossible to distinguish where one body ends and the other begins. Yet this intimacy is never crass; the dancers don’t fuck, they make love. Still, Black and White is imbued with a brazen forthrightness; often the dancers bend their feet instead of pointing them or scurry across the stage on all fours.The next two pieces, “Sarabande” and “Falling Angels,” destabilize gender. Each performed by exclusively male or female groups, the dances play with societal conceptions of masculinity and femininity. “Sarabande” much like Egon Schiele’s “Self-Portrait Masturbating,” centers on male bodily function in both music and movement. Under hovering dresses, the miked dancers pulled off their pink t-shirts, stretching them in front of their genitals, while their grunts sounded eerily. In another similarly masturbatory moment, a male dancer gyrates and touches himself while the others watch. The eight female dancers in “Falling Angels,” alternated between blowing kisses and flaying inelegantly, echoing the juxtaposition of surface and interior that underlay the entire work. If the 90s is known as a period where art concerned itself with the body’s extremities, “Black and White” is certainly no exception. Despite the ethnic flair of Steve Reich’s “Drumming, Part I” to which “Falling Angels” was set, “Black and White” was noticeably blanch. The aesthetic poignancy of perfectly interlocking bodies or the impression of nude figures could not have been created in the presence of a darker skinned dancer. As “Black and White” deconstructs the way in which we interact, it challenges, rather unwittingly, the way race characterizes those relationships. Yet, though the ideological ramifications of the work resound, they never undermine its artistic integrity. In what was arguably the most arresting and indelible moment of the evening, six female dancers were de-robed. They glided across the stage, seemingly bound in black dresses, but then stepped back. They tilted the dresses to the left and then aligned themselves with its form, recreating the illusion that they were seamless extensions of their figures. The fallacy of the presumption that the costumes were inextricably connected to their bodies, their very selfhood, became pitifully and utterly clear. In a time when Proposition 8 reminds us of the debilitating effects of convention, “Black and White” calls for us to remove the trappings and cast aside our rigid codes. Perhaps then, intimacy will displace the levity that dominates the relationships of our generation. —Staff writer Ama R. Francis can be reached at afrancis@fas.harvard.edu.

When two figures as imposing as Igor Stravinsky and W.H. Auden collaborate to produce a work of art, the result is bound to mesmerize. Yet “The Rake’s Progress,” a modern opera first performed in Venice in 1951, is seldom included in the repertoire of major companies due to the common but misguided perception that English opera is inferior to its Italian or German counterpart. Over the past two weekends, the Dunster House Opera sought to correct this under-appreciation of Stravinksy’s work. Though the undertaking was an ambitious choice—the unorthodox rhythmic and harmonic elements of the music are particularly difficult—the company achieved a level of artistry not often seen within the realm of collegiate opera. “The Rake’s Progress” presents a 20th-century adaptation of the Faust legend, which recounts the meteoric rise and fall of the hero Tom Rakewell, portrayed by James B. Onstad ’09. Rakewell’s fortunes are changed when he is approached by the diabolical Nick Shadow (Davone J. Tines ’09), who offers him three wishes in return for his soul. Rakewell’s troubles lead him from a happy spring day in the countryside with his sweetheart Anne Trulove (Eva E.M. Schlitz ’09) to a climactic midnight cemetery scene and, eventually, to an insane asylum. Along the way stops are made in a brothel owned by Mother Goose and at Tom’s wedding to Baba the Turk (Sofia M. Selowsky ’12), London’s most renowned bearded lady.While Auden’s libretto for the most part lacked the moroseness so typical of other renderings of the Faust legend, it stayed true to the deeply introspective nature of the story. Auden’s poetic mastery enabled the libretto to flourish where so many other English writers have failed—namely, in creating a language that lends itself to musical adaptation.The comedic energy of the supporting roles propelled the plot forward between the tempestuous turns of fortune suffered by Onstad’s Tom. Among the cast members, Onstad gave a truly commanding performance. Neither his dramatic composure nor the stellar quality of his singing wavered at any point during his portrayal. Schlitz’s dramatic presence was similarly striking, especially during her aria at the end of the first act. Her upper register rang out with a brilliance and clarity that was genuinely moving. Unfortunately, her lower register was lost at times amid the roar of the orchestra.The supporting performances, sung by Tines and Selowsky, were also notable. Both illustrated a keen understanding of comedic timing and, when necessary, emotional sensitivity. Tines in particular shone in both his sotto-voce singing and his demonic fury during the graveyard scene.The orchestra, under the direction of a very capable Yuga J. Cohler ’11, provided a solid foundation for the production. It was evident that the players as well as Cohler were intent on presenting a rhythmically precise performance, which proved to be no mean task. Although there were some initial troubles settling into a rhythmic groove, by the end of the first act, conductor and orchestra were on the same page. Particularly impressive was the sensitivity with which the players navigated the harmonically difficult passages.Perhaps the greatest asset of the production was its artistic direction under the leadership of Victoria J. Crutchfield ’10. The modern stage design and lighting provided settings with which Harvard students could easily identify: Onstad lamented the loss of his idyllic love while seated at a table covered with empty Solo cups and ping pong balls, several prostitutes passed out next to him. And in a fitting final exit, after revealing his true identity as Satan to Tom and cursing him with insanity, Nick departs into the midst of the audience, eerily signaling that devil is amidst each of us. This exemplifies the artistic thesis espoused in the program notes by both the artistic and musical directors: “In this production we strove for an aesthetic which would reflect this theme of self-consciousness and the aesthetic self-consciousness of the piece.”

The Rokia Traoré concert at the Somerville Theatre last Friday was a real live example of what Christian Lander, author of blog and book “Stuff White People Like,” has been talking about in his ongoing list about the white middle class. The Somerville Theatre was packed with a decidedly middle-aged Caucasian audience who seemed to be all dressed up, with a notable lack of irony, for #118—Ugly Sweater Parties.Traoré, a bluesy artist from Mali who sings in a combination of French, English and Bambara, took the stage to the quiet, but appreciative audience (a man in row J brought binoculars). Traoré mostly performed songs from her latest CD, “Tchamantché,” which is her first release in five years and has received much critical acclaim. “Tchamantche” marks a shift in style for Traoré, who based her new sound around the classic Gretsch electric guitar popular in the 50s and 60s.With music that fits into neither Western nor Malian categories, Traoré’s varied choice of instruments was fitting. Two guitars and a traditional drum set gave the music a more Western feel, while the n’goni, or African lute, and vocalist Naba Traoré added more traditionally African sounds. The well-traveled daughter of a diplomat, Traoré composes music that reflects her diverse influences. One of the most successful instances of this integration was her rendition of the Billie Holiday song “The Man I Love,” in which she adapted both lyrically and melodically. Traoré also incorporated funny ditties that she learned as a child into her performance.   Traoré is a natural performer who spontaneously beams and breaks into languid dance as she sings.  Her songs start off slowly but pick up momentum as she and her band members start to sway back and forth with enthusiasm. In one of her songs, “Zen,” Traoré croons, “Oh, que je suis zen,” before belting the same lyrics as the song intensifies.  Even as she insisted on her relaxed demeanor, the moment proved that Traoré was naturally unable to contain her passion.  Noting that it had been at times a “quiet show,” Traoré encouraged the audience to stand up and dance along with her.  At first, the audience was reluctant (#67—Standing Still at Concerts) but they soon got into the music, some even head-banging. At this point the songs picked up in tempo, and Traoré opened up to the audience. As the concert was the day before Valentine’s Day, she serenaded the audience with sweet songs of young love.  The audience responded in kind, laughing at her stories and intentionally cheesy lyrics.While Traoré’s endearing performance was often light-hearted, some of her work has a serious tone.  She paused before singing “Tounka” to express her reasons for writing it. “I would prefer to see Africa more respected...like a rich country,” she said. “Tounka” explains that “migration can’t be a solution.”  It was getting late for the senior citizens of Somerville, about 10:30, so Traoré wrapped things up.  While I don’t recommend attending such a concert for another twenty years or so, those exiting the theater seemed pleased with their experience.  After all, who doesn’t like #7—Diversity?  Of course, there is much more to Traoré’s music than this simple reduction. With her accessible melodies and infectious personality, Traoré certainly has an appeal for those under 40.  College students take note or else African music will remain just another stereotyped interest waiting to be put on “Stuff White People Like.”

Junior seminars in economics have become the latest victim of the university-wide financial crisis. These 16-person seminars were some of the only small undergraduate courses taught by the department’s faculty. Now that they are gone, face-to-face interaction with a professor is a reality for only a handful of students in the College’s largest concentration. We strongly object to the elimination of this program and implore the department to make every effort to find a viable alternative to make up for the loss of these seminars.
The economics department is perennially plagued with abysmal satisfaction ratings and high student-to-faculty ratios. With its more than 700 concentrators,, one might expect that such a behemoth of a department would enjoy a plethora of resources to accommodate its army of young economists. But this is not the case. Even before the elimination of the program, most economics concentrators were blocked from the seminars due to the small number of spots. Therefore, the loss of the junior seminars is symptomatic of a larger problem with the department’s inability to educate its students in a manner comparable to the smaller concentrations.
Seminars are perhaps the best way for undergraduates to actively participate in the community of learning that the university is supposed to provide. When seated at a small discussion table (though it can be argued that even 16 students is too many for a true seminar experience) students have the opportunity to build close relationships with prestigious faculty. Sitting face to face with Professor Greg Mankiw is very different than watching him lecture from the nosebleed seats in Sanders Theatre in Ec 10. In addition to enjoying a more personalized and active experience, seminar participants can satisfy the concentration writing requirement and gain the writing skills needed to prepare juniors for their senior theses.
It is laudable that most of the erstwhile junior seminars were not eliminated entirely, but instead opened up to function as traditional lectures. However, it is undeniable that the benefits of a seminar course will still be lost. Ultimately, the elimination rather than expansion of the seminars marks a move in the wrong direction that highlights the unfortunate effects of reducing faculty hiring.

Last week, a special court ruled that parents of autistic children were not entitled to compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. The ruling was in response to three cases, each of which involved parents who claimed that their children’s autism was brought on by the measles vaccine in the measles, mumps, and rubella immunization most children receive, or by the combination of the measles vaccine and thimerosal. Although we sympathize with parents of autistic children, we appreciate the court’s decision and hope that it will cause parents who are considering not immunizing their children to think twice.There is currently a growing movement to link the MMR vaccine with autism, yet the scientific community has already widely dismissed the claim that the vaccine causes autism. The original connection between the vaccine and autism was raised in a paper published in the British journal, The Lancet. After it was discovered, however, that the main author of the study had received funding from British trial lawyers seeking the evidence he eventually produced, 10 of the paper’s 12 co-authors redacted their contributions, and the scientific community as a whole discredited the study. As such, it is unreasonable for parents to continue to blame MMR for a disorder that scientists have rather conclusively proved is unrelated.Most unfortunately, the scare perpetuated by believers in the link between autism and the MMR vaccine has led to a sharp decrease in the number of children receiving the vaccine. Currently, every state has a law that mandates vaccination before a child enters public school. States do, however, provide exemptions for medical, religious, and philosophical reasons—and parents have started to request exemptions on the basis of flawed science.Parents who invoke such exemptions as a response to the tenuous evidence and specious reasoning that promote a claim debunked by scientists are truly doing a disservice to all children. The incidence rate of measles has sharply risen over the past few years; more people were infected from January to July 2008 than during any other time since 1996. In the United Kingdom, despite the subsequent denials of the myth relating the MMR vaccine to autism, the percentage of children being immunized for MMR has dropped from 90 to 82 since the original study. Correspondingly, children are now more at risk for the contagious diseases that the vaccine typically prevents. Parents who choose not to immunize their children thus endanger other people’s children; this disregard for others’ health is unreasonable, given the lack of benefits of forgoing immunization.It is clear that the word of the scientific community is not enough to convince parents that immunizing their children will prevent—not cause—further problems. The government therefore has a duty to combat this misinformation by spreading verifiable scientific knowledge regarding the benefits of the MMR vaccine. Bereft of sound evidence that the vaccine causes autism, the movement to link the two must be more publicly disputed. The court did well to realize that, as of yet, there is no verifiable link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Indeed, the leaders of the movement to associate the two would be much better off if they used their energy and resources to research other, more viable potential causes for the disorder, rather than to keep believing in falsehoods.

Every once in a while, I’ll pick up something in the supermarket, check the number of calories, and have enough self-restraint to put it back. Thanks to the FDA, every package of food is clearly labeled with nutrition facts, making it easy to balance the benefits of a tasty treat with the calorie count needed to keep my beach bod.
According to The New York Times, PepsiCo is attempting to extend this idea to the environment. The company recently hired experts to calculate the cost—measured in pounds of carbon dioxide—of one of its products, Tropicana orange juice, which it plans to print on packaging in the future. This innovative move both makes it easier for consumers to be savvy about the environment and holds companies to a higher standard during the manufacturing process. Other leading brands should follow PepsiCo’s lead in publishing carbon-footprint numbers, with the aid and the imperative of the government.
The point of putting calories on food labels is so that we may not only keep count of how many calories we consume, but also compare the calories in different foods. In a world where you can choose a brand of cookies based on its effect on the environment, it will finally be in a company’s best financial interest to shrink its carbon footprint. For an environmentally conscious business, listing the quantitative value right on the box would connect going green to making green.
In such a scenario, a company would not necessarily have to care about global warming for carbon labels to make sense. Such labels will draw attention to the issue of carbon emissions and spur national efforts to discover alternative energy sources. With the price of fuel high and the future uncertain, reducing dependence on foreign energy can only be a good thing.
The advantages of listing carbon footprints, however, will only apply if the idea is applied on a large scale. PepsiCo should be applauded for its first efforts, but, in order to give meaning to the numbers, other companies must follow its lead. For example, PepsiCo’s investigations revealed that one half-gallon carton of orange juice costs the equivalent of 3.75 pounds of carbon dioxide. To most people who don’t spend their lives in laboratories, this number signifies absolutely nothing—yes, it is the result of growing oranges, running a factory, and transporting the orange juice. But if more products were labeled, a number like 3.75 would have comparative value.
There’s no doubt that a government mandate that each product list its carbon footprint would be ambitious, especially considering the cost and effort of the process. However, a tax credit could be offered to producers willing to publish their products’ quantitative effects on global warming. This would create incentives for many companies in the short run, and a new law could finish the job in the long run.
And, though it will be an expensive, arduous process to determine so many products’ carbon footprints, this is the clear next step in fighting pollution and climate change. Remember the fights between Bud Light and Miller Lite over calorie counts? Imagine if their advertising slogan were applied to the environment: “More taste, less carbon.”

On Feb. 9, an LTTE suicide bomber killed herself inside a crowded transit camp maintained by the government for displaced Tamil civilians in northern Sri Lanka. She killed and injured scores of Tamil men, women, and children awaiting transport to safer areas. A day later, the LTTE shot and killed 19 civilians as they attempted to cross over to government held areas. The incident was not widely reported in international media, perhaps due to its low political appeal. However, it is absolutely imperative that we resolve—as a global community—that no rebel group or government be allowed to commit such crimes against humanity again. 
As a Sri Lankan who has spent most of his life in a brutal conflict between the government and the LTTE—also known as the Tamil Tigers—I have seen many instances in which crime against helpless civilians could have been avoided had the global community devised better mechanisms and conventions to those affected by conflict. 
Just as gravity pulls together the local chaotic movements of water droplets to orchestrate the outer geometric identity of a waterfall, conventions pull together human turmoil to orchestrate the notion of humanity. The Tamil Tigers can perpetrate the above crime and face mere condemnation from a few countries, because almost no convention to protect war-affected communities exerts enough pressure on rebel groups who abuse civilians. Nearly all mechanisms are devised to limit the scope of military action that a government can take to face a rebellion, which has been proven insufficient to protect internally displaced persons. Moreover, this pressure imbalance is often abused by parties with vested interests to interfere in the internal politics of war-affected countries like Sri Lanka, further compounding the vicious cycle for those affected.
Modern conflicts with sophisticated international involvements—combined with the bitter experiences faced by countries like Sri Lanka during the colonial past—often lead such governments to take extreme precautions to ensure no covert foreign force creeps into their internal politics again. This was evident in Sri Lanka when the government ordered all non-governmental organizations except the International Committee of Red Cross to leave rebel-held areas in September 2008. This action was taken after Sri Lankan authorities learned that several NGOs had wittingly or unwittingly given material aid to the Tamil Tigers.
For example, the government’s unmanned aerial vehicles identified heavy equipments belonging to an NGO called “Norwegian People’s Aid” being used by the LTTE to build a complex network of massive earth bunds around its major strongholds, such as Killinochchi and Mulattivu. Some bunds were longer than 30 miles and rose above 10 feet. When questioned, the NPA replied that LTTE robbed the machinery from them. The government’s position was further consolidated when the program officer of another NGO, called “ZOA,” stated that he would remain with the LTTE to fight against the government, thus disobeying the demand to move out of the rebel-held area.
The civilians of the country were victimized most out of this political drama. Therefore, there is great need to introduce innovative global conventions to exert adequate pressure on NGOs operating in war-affected countries—especially with a colonial history—to absolutely honor the sovereignty of the country. The pressure from the donors alone has proven to be insufficient in the Sri Lankan case.
Furthermore, in the absence of independent information sources to assess the situation of IDPs trapped between the warring parties, the global community should empower international organizations like the United Nations to use modern technology such as satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircrafts to verify claims made by various parties. For instance, the Sri Lankan government claimed that the Tamil Tigers had moved more than six heavy artillery guns into the governmentally declared safe zone to invite return fire to civilian neighborhoods. The LTTE, on the other hand, claimed that the government forces had shelled a hospital in Puthukkudyiruppu. This hit the headlines of many international media. The only way the government could prove it was false was to take images using a Beechcraft. Had there been powerful global conventions to allow the UN to use modern technology to verify such politically sensitive claims, room for political gains over the lives of innocent civilians could have been blocked. By leaving allowances to political bigotry, we are putting the lives of thousands of civilians at risk.
Due to the fact that communities and their aspirations continue to change, conflicts are an indispensable reality in our societies. My definition of peace is an atmosphere in which harmonious change can occur. Therefore, I am stressing the need to introduce innovative global conventions to exert balanced pressure on all stakeholders in a conflict zone. This would keep disturbances within the frame of humanity, just as gravity orchestrates droplets colliding without repeatable pattern into a waterfall.

For Harvard Square eateries, Valentine’s Day indicated that love is blind—even to recessions.Every restaurant contacted reported dining rooms booked solid with celebrating couples ordering as if the housing crisis had never happened.And managers and owners said diners did not scale back, ordering prix fixe menus as well as tipping generously.Valentine’s Day’s weekend placement may also have contributed to the crowds, as Saturday nights tend to be busy for restaurants.While business on the lover’s holiday seems not to have slumped, the local restaurant industry hasn’t dodged the effects of a declining economy, as diners have cut back on discretionary spending.One such casualty was café Z Square on JFK Street, which closed its doors in January after management complaints and flagging profits. At Small Plates, which opened in late 2007, co-owner Jerome R. Picca said that all the tables had been booked a week and a half in advance of the holiday.“You would never have guessed there was some kind of economic problem in the country based on what the sales and tipping were on Valentine’s Day,” he said. At Upstairs on the Square, the outlook was rosy, even outside of the holiday.Matthew C. Lishanky, director of operations, said that Upstairs has seen little to no change in business overall—possibly even a small uptick.Lishanky said that Feb. 14 had been booked far in advance, with 30 people hoping for an opening on the restaurant’s waitlist.As for Valentine’s Day, “There wasn’t an empty table from 11 in the morning until midnight,” said Mary-Catherine Deibel. Upstairs offered two fixed-price menus, either $85 or $125, depending on where they dined in the restaurant.And the servers felt the love too.“Tipping’s very good on Valentine’s Day,” Deibel said. “Everyone’s trying to impress their date.”Paul D. Consorti, president and co-founder of desserterie Finale, said that despite the economy, diners have been turning out in force for special occasions and weekend nights, and Valentine’s Day was no exception.The restaurant, which focuses on desserts, was fully booked during main dining hours on Saturday.Consorti said that while business has been lagging on early weekday nights and that diners are spending a bit less on average, people still want to celebrate. “The time you would expect us to be busy, we’re still busy,” he said.Ivan T. Law, the general manager of Harvest, said that he has seen an increase in business at the bar, where food is less expensive than the main dining room. “People are definitely more conscious about where they’re spending their money,” Law said.But the restaurant, like others in Harvard Square, was booked two weeks in advance of Valentine’s Day. Law said that business on Saturday was “fantastic.”It was the same story at Rialto in the Charles Hotel, where diners didn’t skimp on dinner, often opting for tasting menus.“It was one of the busier valentine’s days in recent history,” said general manager Michael J. Mooney. “Even to the last moment, people were calling all morning long for reservations.”Christy Leveroni, dining room manager at Chez Henri, a French-Cuban restaurant close to the Quad, recalled business was the same as the last time Valentine’s fell on a Saturday, back in 2004.Though she recounted horror stories from other struggling eateries, Leveroni said Chez Henri has been “cushioned,” for the most part.“[Diners are] still coming in,” she said. “The bar is full every night.”—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu. Links:Z-Square: http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=526247

The Undergraduate Council will loosen restrictions this week governing use of $45,000 of the Student Life Fund—a $75,000 pool created to finance student group travel and House formals—in order to allow more grants to be distributed in the upcoming semester.The fund, established in Sept. 2008, draws from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’s discretionary budget. Prior to its creation, the UC only funded travel within the Boston area.But with just $2563.08 distributed to student groups for transportation costs last semester, the caps placed on the fund—$30 per student for travel by bus or train, $80 per student for travel by plane, and a $1000 maximum per student group—are being revised.The current rules require that the fund subsidize travel for student organizations seeking unique, new opportunities, and not for annual events.According to Finance Committee Chair Sundeep S. Iyer ’11, caps on the amount an organization can receive are expected to be raised this coming week.  The council expects student groups to request funds in the spring because national competitions—many of which occur in the second semester, according to Iyer—are eligible for funding.“We’re responding to the fact that our caps were too low and making sure that our policies are helpful,” said UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10. “This semester was a trial period.”And with raised caps and potentially more events needing support, Flores said the UC is anticipating more applications in the spring.The Harvard College Democrats were one of seven student groups to receive money for travel expenses last semester from the fund. Though the Democrats requested $2000 to finance their trip to Bucks County, Pa. in October, they were only granted $750. The money allowed a couple dozen students to travel to Pennsylvania to canvass for the re-election of Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy and the election of then-presidential hopeful Barack Obama.“It was unquestionably helpful in funding our trip,” said Elise X. Liu ’11, the communications director for the Democrats and a Crimson editorial writer. “Long-distance trips are extremely expensive. We wouldn’t have been able to go without it.”The Student Life Fund also allocates $30,000 for house formals. According to Iyer, the UC gave all Houses the expected $1250 for their formals in the fall semester and anticipates giving $1250 again to each House this semester.Distribution of the fund is handled by the UC’s Finance Committee. Organizations apply for funding through the Common Grant Application and then interview with the Finance Committee, which makes a recommendation to the entire UC.—Staff writer Brittany M.

The Harvard Alumni Association released a list Thursday of 10 candidates gunning for a seat on Harvard’s Board of Overseers—the University’s second highest governing body.
Beginning in mid-April, alumni will be able to vote for five new Overseers to serve six-year terms on the 30-member board. An additional Overseer will be chosen to finish out the term of Arne S. Duncan ’86, who has joined President Barack Obama’s administration as Secretary of Education. The results of the election will be announced at this year’s June 4 Commencement ceremony.
The Board of Overseers serves as a sounding board for University administrators and conducts reviews of schools, programs, and specific issues of interest, such as campus arts. Major administrative and teaching appointments, such as that of the University President, require the approval of both the Overseers and the Corporation—the University’s chief governing body.
One nominee in this year’s election, Walter K. Clair ’77, who is a professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he was contacted by the alumni association several months before candidates were announced to gauge his interest in serving as an Overseer. Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and former Crimson editor Linda J. Greenhouse ’68—who for three decades covered the Supreme Court for the New York Times until her retirement last year—was perhaps the most high-profile figure on the HAA roster.
But for the first time since 1999, the ballot will also list two self-nominated candidates, who had to petition for over 200 alumni signatures to be considered in the election. Such write-in candidates have historically faced an uphill battle in the voting process. The last self-nominated candidate to win a seat on the board was Nobel Peace Prize-winning human rights activist Desmond Tutu in 1989. 
President Obama himself, who ran as a self-nominated candidate in 1991 on a platform of divestment from South Africa, failed in his bid, boasting a thin resume pinned on his experience as a former “community development director” and Harvard Law Review president. Among the triumphant that year was then-senior vice president of Microsoft Steven A. Ballmer ’77, a former Crimson business editor.
Clair said he, like most HAA-nominated candidates, does not intend to campaign for the position. If elected, Clair said he would push to make a Harvard education more affordable for undergraduate and graduate students alike and to maintain the University’s commitment to a diverse community.
“It’s easy to do that when the endowment is up eight or 12 percent,” Clair said. “It’s much harder when the growth is not there.”
Clair said that in spite of the current economic climate, he hopes the University will continue to actively recruit for a diverse student body and faculty. Law School alumnus Harvey A. Silverglate, one of the two write-in candidates, said he would campaign to reform what he believes to be University censorship, as well as the College’s Administrative Board—which he deems “one of the worst, if not the worst, student disciplinary tribunals in the country.”
Filling out the 2009 ballot are Photeine M. Anagnostopoulos ’81, Joshua S. Boger, Morgan Chu, Mark D. Gearan ’78, Margaret A. Levi, Cristian Samper K., and Robert L. Freedman ’62.

The Harvard Law Review, one of the nation’s most prestigious legal journals,  elected second-year law student Joanna N. Huey ’06 as its 123rd president earlier this month.Huey was chosen in a closed process from a pool of self-nominated candidates that traditionally includes some of the Law School’s top students.Speaking with The Crimson in the Law Review’s Gannett House headquarters, Huey said she hoped to maintain the journal’s standards of scholarship.“My main goal is to keep doing what my predecessors have been doing—the leadership team from last year have done a great job on both the scholarship side and the community side,” Huey said. “I’m hoping to keep things on the same track.”Unlike many other student groups, top leaders at the Law Review do not take office with a specific agenda; rather, Huey said, the president’s primary focus is “to put out the best journal possible.”Huey steps into a storied office, which has served as a stepping stone to future success for many Law School graduates, including President Barack Obama.The student-run Law Review is given top billing among the nation’s legal journals, attracting unsolicited submissions in many fields of legal scholarship from professors across the country. The Law Review has no formal ties to Harvard University and, with a circulation of 4000, maintains financial independence.Huey did not specify how the Law Review’s financial footing would be affected by the current economic downturn or what steps she would take to ensure the journal’s financial well-being.Huey assumes the Law Review presidency from Robert W. Allen, a third-year law student.Allen said he had confidence in the new president and thought she would continue the journal’s reputation for top scholarship.“The qualities that we look for in a president are someone who is smart, hard-working, and easy to get along with, and I think Joanna embodies those qualities,” Allen said.“I was surprised to have the opportunity to do this, and I think it’s an incredible privilege and honor.” Huey said. “I hope I can live up to the reputation, history, and standards of the Review.”Last year, the Law Review instituted a new technology chair to expand the journal’s publications in law and technology. Although the chair remains “nebulous,” it represents an avenue of potential expansion, Huey said.Huey, a California native, graduated from Harvard College in 2006 with a degree in physics and math. She is pursuing a joint-degree from the Kennedy School and the Law School.—Staff writer Elias J. Groll can be reached at egroll@fas.harvard.edu.

This year’s Datamatch—the electronic compatibility program hosted by the Harvard Computer Society—saw record participation, with 1755 people filling out the survey.
Of the participants, 779 were male and 976 were female, according to the HCS Web site. While the majority were freshmen, seniors came in a close second, with only 99 fewer participants. 23 Harvard alums also filled out the survey.
According to HCS membership coordinator Greg Brockman ’12, participation has fluctuated greatly throughout the years ever since the electronic match-maker’s conception in 1994.
In 2001, Datamatch had 1500 participants, though it tapered off for a few years. Brockman said. “But this year we had a very strong upswing with 1755 participants.”
HCS President Keito Uchiyama ’11 attributed this success to increased publicity and a new design interface for the project.
“Rather than something from the 1990s, it now looks like something from 2009,” he said.
Calling, e-mailing, and Facebook-stalking ensued after Datamatch results were released, as curious students got acquainted or re-acquainted with their matches.
Rose Yan ’10 said her experience echoed that of many of her peers. She said she e-mailed her top ten to say hello and later Facebook friended them.
“I had dinner with a friend who was also my number two match,” she said. “It was good to catch up.” 
While the questions of Datamatch were for the most part playful and entertaining, Yan had a bone to pick with question number 12, which asked which was the surveyors’ most prominent feature—eyes, hair, glasses, acne, or touchscreen. 
“The intent of the survey as a whole was to entertain, and I don’t see what is entertaining about acne,” she said. “I can see how people would be offended by that question.”
With the results of Datamatch sent out, discussion has also arisen about the “secret algorithm” that Datamatch uses to match people. The members of HCS were decidedly coy, saying only that the algorithm is complex and intricate. 
“The algorithm has been built up over the generations, and it is several thousand nights of code,” Uchiyama said. 
Given the past success of Datamatch in matching up couples such as previous HCS president Joshua A. Kroll ’09 with his girlfriend, Datamatch has attracted attention from beyond Harvard’s borders.
“We do receive some requests from other colleges asking to divulge the algorithm but our main job is to bring fun and love to the Harvard campus,” Uchiyama said.
Students eager to find their one true love who may have missed out on the fun this year can count down the seconds to Datamatch 2010 on HCS’s Web site.

A congressional panel has adopted Harvard Business School Professor David A. Moss’ recently released paper as the basis of its recommendation for increased regulation of financial institutions.The paper, written in January but released online last week, suggested that regulations are effective at preventing crises such as the current economic meltdown. Moss said he conducted research on behalf of the Troubled Asset Relief Program Congressional Oversight Panel, which was composing a statement on regulatory reform. The panel’s report drew on Moss’ work to promote insuring and overseeing “systematically significant” financial institutions.Moss suggests that New Deal regulations were effective, but that their success created complacency.“Many took for granted the remarkable stability that had been achieved,” he said in an interview. “From there, it was easy to accept the philosophy that we didn’t need regulation. But the truth is that regulation was needed, and we should have thought hard about how to update our regulatory system as the financial markets evolved.”To address these concerns, Moss’ report proposes that a government agency should identify systematic risks, regulate them, and insure them against failure. The Congressional Oversight Panel added this proposal to their report.The panel includes three Harvard affiliates: the chairwoman, Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren; attorney Damon A. Silvers ’86, who also holds law and business degrees from Harvard; and former New Hampshire Republican Senator John E. Sununu, a Business School graduate.Moss said he had been contacted by a number of government officials intrigued by his ideas.“There’s been a significant amount of interest, and it strikes me as very positive and healthy,” he said.However, Sununu and the panel’s other conservative, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, objected to the paper’s conclusions. In a dissent to the report, they argued that guaranteeing insurance creates moral hazard and reduces innovation.“Instead of creating new regulatory hurdles, a superior approach to better protect consumers and preserve wealth-creating opportunities is to enhance and reinforce [existing] wise regulation,” they wrote.Regardless of partisan opinions, some scholars said they believe that portions of Moss’ findings are infallible. Business School economist Rafael M. Di Tella said that the government’s readiness to insure large institutions deemed vital to the U.S. economy—even without prior agreements—means additional regulation would only reduce moral hazard.“Once we [have an implicit guarantee], his approach has to be correct­—has to be,” Di Tella said. “In a very uncertain time I think that’s a very strong statement to make.”—Staff writer William N. White can be reached at wwhite@fas.harvard.edu.

A café called Tory Row is slated to open at the end of the month on Brattle Street in the former home of the Greenhouse Café, which closed nearly two years ago after three decades in the Square.Tory Row will be a full service, 80-seat restaurant with both European and American elements, according to co-owner Matthew W. Curtis. The café’s interior design and menu are still being finalized.Richard Getz, who owns the 3 Brattle St. location, hinted that the restaurant would open near the end of the month, but both he and a spokeswoman for Tory Row declined to provide an exact date.“There’s still so much of the concept that’s being developed, so we can’t really say much for certain at this point,” said spokeswoman Elizabeth Lescaze.Curtis and the restaurant’s other owner, Christopher A. Lutes, already run four other Boston-area restaurants: Cambridge 1, which has one location in Harvard Square and another at Fenway, Middlesex Lounge, Audobon Circle, and Miracle of Science.“They have a very successful formula,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “We’re confident that this will also be a very popular location.”Tory Row was originally scheduled to open last November, after Curtis and Lutes signed a lease with Getz that fall.“The owners have been paying rent all along, but they have very high standards around the place’s design and concept,” Jillson said. “So this has all been prolonged.”Tory Row was a former nickname of Brattle Street, where many loyalists lived during the American Revolution.“It’s a great space and we’re all anxious for it to open,” Jillson said of Tory Row’s location. “I think it will add a whole new level of street life to a corner that badly needs it.”Curtis and Lutes, who are known for their unusual, design-centric bars and grills, opened their first restaurant in Cambridge, Miracle of Science, next to MIT in 1991.                                                                                      —Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

Professors in the Harvard Economics department have voiced opposing views on the recently-approved economic stimulus package, debating the merits of the plan’s incentives and payouts.
Under the new plan, the government will increase spending on infrastructure to try to boost the nation’s shrinking gross domestic product. In addition, the package provides tax rebates to consumers in an attempt to bolster spending.
Most of the publicly-broadcasted opinion from the economics department has fallen on the conservative side, opposing the stimulus plan on the basis of economic theory. 
In a Jan. 22 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and a later interview with The Atlantic Magazine, economics professor Robert J. Barro attacked the package’s underlying principle that government spending is especially effective in boosting gross domestic product—arguing that tax cuts incentivize people to save, rather than consume or work, and that funneling money into building infrastructure may lead to the construction of “bridges to nowhere.”
Barro’s distrust of government spending as an effective way to counter the recession has been echoed by colleagues such as Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw and Martin S. Feldstein ’61, who recently detailed his criticisms in an op-ed in the Washington Post last month entitled, “An $800 Billion Mistake.”
While Professor Philippe Aghion offered a more moderate view of the stimulus plan, he too voiced skepticism of the effectiveness of the tax cut in stimulating consumption. 
“There is a concern that if you reduce taxes, people will save,” he said. “Maybe that is what you want to do in the long term, but that is not what you want to do in the short term.” 
David I. Laibson, a professor in the department who specializes in behavioral economics, said tax cuts for low-income households will likely be spent in the first year, rather than in the first months after the cut. 
Department Chair James H. Stock wrote in an e-mail that empirical evidence suggested that 40 to 60 percent of cuts are spent in a “relatively short period.” 
Aghion also said that tax cuts may ameliorate the financial situation of those hit by the recession.
“Macroeconomists cannot ignore the bad externalities of unemployment—like rising poverty and violence,” he said. “This is not just a stimulus package but an insurance package.” 
Aghion said that unemployment may be helped through spending on improving infrastructure. 
While Barro has argued that directing government expenditures to infrastructure may lead to inefficient, useless projects, Stock wrote that the bill “has infrastructure spending determined by the states directly,” and that decision-making may be more transparent on a state level.

After heated debate, the Undergraduate Council passed legislation yesterday allocating $300 to the creation of brochures that inform students about the options available to pregnant women at Harvard. The Council also granted $24,151.45 to student groups in its first round of funding for the spring semester. The brochure will provide information on options relating both to termination and to pre-natal and post-natal care.The bill, which was co-sponsored by high-ranking members of the Harvard College Women’s Center, Harvard Right to Life, Harvard Students for Choice, and the Radcliffe Union of Students, allocated $150 to the design of the brochure and $150 to its printing. The Women’s Center is allocating an additional $300 to the effort.Susan Y. Yao ’09-’10, an intern at the Women’s Center and a sponsor of the legislation, said the bill allows students a means to get information that is consistent—rather than being dependent on which doctor’s office students go to.“There wasn’t a very transparent process if students found themselves pregnant,” Yao said.Eric N. Hysen ’11, the council’s parliamentarian, proposed an amendment to strike funding the brochure. Hysen said that funding the brochure would set a precedent that the UC was willing to fund projects when The College should be paying for them.Doug R. Lloyd ’09, the UC’s secretary and the sole dissenting vote on the bill, voiced his belief that the expenditure had not been thoroughly thought out.“I’m concerned we’ve moved through this process way too quickly,” he said. “I just don’t want to have the UC’s money wasted.”But Tamar Holoshitz ’10, chair of the UC’s Student Affairs Committee, said the funding was a “drop in the bucket” compared to the money the UC normally spends. She added that the legislation had been the works for at least a year and a half.Debate became contentious over the amendment and parliamentary procedure, which pitted some UC members against Hysen.When the amendment failed, with only four votes in support, Holoshitz called for a roll-call vote on the final legislation, which both Hysen and Lloyd called political.“I think when you vote as a council representative you should be accountable to your vote,” Holoshitz said.Ultimately Hysen voted for the bill and said the roll-call vote did not affect his decision to support the bill, which he said he strongly supports.At the same meeting, the UC allocated $24,151.45 to 86 different projects in its spring grants packet legislation. That package received one amendment, proposed by Cyrus M. Mossavar-Rahmani ’09. He attempted to strike funding for On Harvard Time’s mural, but the motion ultimately failed.“I think On Harvard Time is a kind of clique that funds itself pretty generously so it’s not clear why the UC should fund a group that’s already pretty well taken care of,” he said.—Staff writer Eric P.

A body was discovered in the Charles River at approximately 1 p.m. yesterday. It was found on the Allston side of Eliot Bridge, which connects Soldier’s Field Road in Allston to Cambridge. A jogger reported the finding to Massachusetts State troopers assigned to barracks in Brighton, according to NECN.com.  The body was found in a state of some decomposition, so no definitive signs of foul play have yet been identified.  An autopsy scheduled to be performed today is expected to reveal more information about the identity of the indiviudal, including its gender and age, according to NECN.com.This case, like all incidences involving bodies discovered in Boston, will be prosecuted by the Suffolk County District Attorney’s office, according to the Boston Police Department.

Sociology professor Nicholas A. Christakis and his wife Erika L. Christakis ’86 will become Pforzheimer House’s new masters this fall, said Pfoho Resident Dean Lisa Boes Monday night. The announcement—first reported by The Crimson last night—came more than two months after current Pfoho Masters Sue and James J. McCarthy declared their intention to step down this November.Christakis—a sociology professor with a joint appointment at Harvard Medical School and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—is best known for his work on health and social networks. His current research explores how factors such as health, disability, and death can influence an individual’s social network.“As I have spent the last few years examining the ripple effects of social networks and how social structures affect lives, I’ve become more mindful of the effect I have on others and they on me,” Christakis said in response to a question about how his academic research would shape his leadership style.  “You can’t turn a House into a laboratory, but there’s definitely a sense in which House life can cultivate a sense of connectedness,” he said.   Prior to the announcement, some Pfoho residents had said they hoped to see greater diversity in the new House Master selection.“We have a president [Barack Obama] who represents the diverse experience of America,” said Alneada D. Biggers ’10, Pfoho resident and president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, before news of the Christakis appointment broke. “It would be nice to have a House Master who represents who I am.”The concerns were brought to a point in an online petition started last week by Blake L. Johnson ’09 to encourage the hiring of a more diverse tutor staff.But after receiving news of the selection of the Christakis couple, both of whom are Caucasian, Johnson said he was “personally pleased as a sociology concentrator” to hear of the appointment.  Biggers, who listed House Master diversity as one of her key campaign planks in an unsuccessful bid for the Undergraduate Council vice presidency this fall, reiterated her hopes yesterday evening that future House Master searches could yield minority selections.  “Its not surprising,” she said of the Christakis selection. “I hope that when other house master positions become open, they can consider minorities...but I can’t belittle [Christakis’] qualifications.”Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, the former Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, has said in previous interviews with The Crimson that she hoped to usher minority faculty into recently opened House Master positions. That aim was furthered last Wednesday, when Hammonds announced that Law School Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Law School lecturer Stephanie Robinson would take over as leaders of the house next fall, becoming Harvard’s first black House Masters.The Christakis family is relatively young, comprising three children, Sebastian, Lysander, and Eleni, whose ages range from 11 to 16. Christakis is both a medical doctor and a Ph.D., holding four degrees from various Ivy League institutions, including a B.S. from Yale and a master’s from the Harvard School of Public Health. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine, a prominent national advisory board, in 2006. While researching at the Medical School, he continues to teach a popular course at the College, Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the USA: Medicine and Disease in Social Context.” Christakis’ wife, Erika, who is currently traveling in India, is an anthropologist and elementary school teacher who has spent her professional career advocating for children and families. A graduate of the College, she holds a master’s degree in early childhood education from Lesley University and one in public health from Johns Hopkins. Christakis said he and his family were so warmly welcomed by the Pfoho House community during the selection process that they felt like they were “coming home.”“The McCarthys have set such an amazing example that, over the years, students are disappointed in being ‘rivered,’” he said, reversing a common student stigma against being placed in the far-away Quad. “We have big shoes to fill.”He added that he and his wife’s undergraduate experiences—his at Yale, and hers at the College—have demonstrated to the couple that “House life is crucial to the undergraduate experience.”Christakis, who said he was planning to rename a family rabbit “Pfunny” to reflect the House’s phonetically perplexing name, said it was a Sunday morning brunch that sealed the deal for the family.“As [Lysander] was pouring batter into the waffle maker, he saw the Veritas insignia,” Christakis said, speaking of his son. “And he was sold.”McCarthy said that he “thought the Christakis’ would be a perfect match for Pfoho.” —Staff writer Bita M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A junior from Leverett House was robbed at gunpoint while walking down Plympton Street at approximately 8:30 p.m. Saturday night, according to the victim.The perpetrator, described by the victim as a young white man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, threatened the student with a “realistic-looking BB gun.”A suspect was arrested later that night by the Cambridge Police Department near Au Bon Pain, according to Steven G. Catalano, the spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department.The victim, who requested anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said he was returning to his room in Leverett and was in front of old Quincy House when he was approached from behind by the perpetrator. The robber petitioned the student for money, and the situation escalated when the student refused, according to the victim.“He stuck one hand into the front pocket of his hoodie and pulled out what appeared to be the handle of a gun,” the victim said. The victim said he did not know that it was a BB gun until later that night.The student said he then handed over all the cash in his wallet. The robber allegedly left in the direction that he came, running toward Mt. Auburn Street. “Our officers stopped a suspect near Au Bon Pain, but [the Cambridge Police Department] ultimately made the arrest,” wrote Catalano in an e-mailed statement. The robbery occurred outside HUPD’s jurisdiction as it took place on a city street, so the suspect will be handled by the Cambridge police, according to Catalano.The Cambridge Police Department did not return requests for comment over the weekend.According to CPD’s third quarter crime analysis report, 112 robberies occurred in Cambridge between Jan. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2008, the latest dates for which information is currently available, 89 of which were street robberies. During this time, there were 53 cases of larceny from a person in Harvard Square. There were 161 robberies in Cambridge in 2007, according to the police department’s annual report. Of these cases, 120 were street robberies. “As for Harvard, our robbery numbers stayed the same from 2007 to 2008,” wrote Catalano in an e-mailed statement.—Staff writer Emily J.

Becoming a House tutor this year just might be more competitive than getting into Harvard College itself.Nearly 300 applicants are vying for six resident tutor openings in Mather House this year, a significant increase over previous years, according to Mather business tutor Joseph S. Ronayne ’92.Other Houses have seen similar jumps, according to tutors and administrators, though they stressed the variable nature of application numbers and said they did not have concrete data from past application pools.The spike in this year’s candidates—particularly graduate students—may reflect the position’s heightened appeal in light of limited job opportunities in the current economic climate.“In difficult economic times, when people are more concerned with maintaining financial stability, becoming a tutor looks more attractive,” said Mather House Master Sandra A. Naddaff ’75.In addition to stable housing, a limited meal plan, and in some cases a stipend, there are other advantages to the position, Nadaff said. Graduate school is often “isolating,” and Houses can provide tutors with a “sense of community,” she said.Mather House officials weren’t the only ones to report a measurable spike in tutor applications—Adams House Master Judith S. Palfrey ’67 said that she was excited about a larger pool of “diverse” applicants in Adams. Joshua D. Goldman, a fellowships tutor in Lowell House, said that though the number of annual applicants varies “widely,” applications were “much higher” this year.Pforzheimer House Allston-Burr Resident Dean Lisa Boes said the House received “hundreds of applicants” this year, though she said she has yet to obtain a concrete number.NOT JUST NUMBERSBut Boes said tutor selection can never be just a matter of numbers. Though the undergraduates, tutors, and House administrators active in tutor selection try to make diverse racial and sexual orientation a “number-one” consideration in the hiring process, Boes said, they are often constrained by the needs of individual Houses.“Where we have flexibility, race and sexual orientation are a priority. But the more important question is, Where do the tutors come from?” Boes said. “What you don’t see is the other side of it—just because we have a ton of applicants doesn’t mean that we have enough chemistry or government tutors. There are certain fields that are really important to cover.”In spite of these practical considerations, some Pfoho residents are voicing support for a top-down diversification of House tutors. Blake L. Johnson ’09 started a House-wide petition last week, which he says he will present to outgoing House Masters Sue and James J. McCarthy next Monday.“As many of you are aware, our residential tutor staff in Pfoho is entirely white and heterosexual-identifying. As many of you are also aware, we as a student body are not,” Johnson wrote in an e-mail sent over the House’s list, adding that “this has been the case for two years.”Johnson said his petition is timely in light of the selection, announced last Wednesday, of Law School Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Law School lecturer Stephanie Robinson as the College’s first black House Masters—picks that reflected comments made by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds that she would like to foster greater diversity among a group that contains few minority members.Despite that push, Pfoho’s new House Masters will not be minorities. Nicholas A. Christakis, a distinguished professor who works at both Harvard Medical School and the College, and his wife Erika—both white—will become Pfoho’s new House Masters in the fall, the College announced last night. Some Pforzheimer residents said before yesterday’s announcement that they had hoped their new House Masters would similarly reflect the diversity of their House community, in particular, and that of the campus in general.“It’s a really encouraging piece of news for the administration to make our community represented,” said Pforzheimer resident Alneada D. Biggers ’10—who made House Master diversity a central issue in her unsuccessful bid for Undergraduate Council vice president this fall—of the Winthrop picks. “It makes me really proud of the dean of our college.”—Staff writer Bita M.

Alison Des Forges ’64, a graduate of Radcliffe College and one of the world’s leading voices on human rights abuses in Rwanda, was one of 49 passengers killed in the crash of Continental Flight 3407 outside Buffalo Thursday night.Her death—part of the first fatal commercial airliner crash in the United States in more than two years—was confirmed by the New York-based non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch, where she worked for over two decades as a senior adviser in the Africa division. In a statement released on its Web site, Human Rights Watch praised Des Forges as “the world’s leading expert on the 1994 Rwanda genocide and its aftermath.”Those who knew Des Forges at Radcliffe, when she went by her maiden name Alison Liebhafsky, expressed no surprise that she had made her life’s work to uncover the human rights abuses in the world.Susan E. Shepard ’65, who lived in Comstock Hall (now part of Pforzheimer House) with Des Forges, said she remembered her as a smart and serious student, as well as “kind and gentle.”“She always went out of her way to be nice to me,” Shepard said.Karen L. Worth ’64, Des Forges’ close friend, echoed those sentiments, saying that Des Forges was “always thinking of other people,” from her time at Radcliffe through her later years.Worth and Des Forges met at Radcliffe and bonded over a shared dedication to the Phillip Brooks House Association, a student-run public service organization.They quickly became friends and spent the summer after their junior years in Tanzania, working in an abandoned refugee camp near the Rwandan border. The summer sparked Des Forges’ interest in Rwanda, and she wrote her Ph.D. thesis about the nation while working toward a degree at Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.In 1999, Des Forges was awarded the MacArthur “Genius Grant” Award for her work as an activist and her book, “Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda.” “She was fearless, courageous, the consummate professional,” said Des Forges’ colleague Georgette Gagnon, director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “She was the kind of person who would in any situation have the smartest and wisest decision on the course of action to be taken.”In her time at Human Rights Watch, Des Forges spent four years interviewing the victims of the Rwanda genocide and provided expert witness testimony before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.Despite the seriousness of her work, Gagnon said Des Forges always maintained her sense of humor. “She was a great pleasure to work with and to be with,” her co-worker said. “She was fun, sociable, a wonderful colleague, mentor, and friend.”  Des Forges is survived by her husband, Roger V. Des Forges, two children, and three grandchildren.“The Harvard-Radcliffe community should be so proud of her and so proud of her work,” Shepard said. “I hope we will do something to commemorate Alison and to build on the work that she started.”

As James Franco was presented with the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year Award last Friday night, the “Spider Man” and “Pineapple Express” star not only had to prove worthy of the honor—he had to prove that he was a man.Franco, who maintained a sheepish demeanor throughout the roast, first had his manhood called into question when Hasty Pudding Theatricals producer Pierce E. Tria ’10 brought up Franco’s admission to The New York Times that—despite growing up with a Jewish mother—he had never had a Bar Mitzvah.“We can’t give him Man of the Year if he’s not a man!” said fellow Hasty Pudding producer Charlotte E. Twaalfhoven ’10, who roasted Franco along with Tria. Members of the Hasty Pudding cast then sprang into action to give Franco an impromptu Bar Mitzvah, led by “Rabbi Spider Man” and complete with the band’s rendition of “Hava Nagila.”“That was actually really touching,” Franco later said of his unexpected induction into manhood.At a press conference after the event, Franco said he plans to have another Bar Mitzvah when he gets a break from working toward an MFA in fiction writing from Columbia. Franco said he is now writing a novel and has a book of interrelated short stories that might be published soon. Twaalfhoven and Tria, whose roast preceded the debut of the Hasty Pudding’s new show, “Acropolis Now,” also teased Franco about some of his less famous roles, such as Apartment Guy #3 in the movie “Some Body” and Officer #2 in an episode of “The X Files.” But during the press conference, Franco took his own jab at the Pudding, saying he was never in “The X Files,” despite its listing on his Internet Movie Database profile.Over the course of the roast, Franco was forced to don an eye patch, purple high heels, a blonde wig, and a sparkling golden bra shaped like a pineapple, before he was presented with the traditional Pudding Pot.“I couldn’t ask for anything more,” Franco said after receiving the Pudding Pot. “I’ve made it.”During the press conference, Franco compared the Hasty Pudding award to  others he had received in the past, including the Golden Globe he won for his performance in the biographical movie “James Dean.”“I can’t think of an award show that would equal this,” Franco said. “I’ve received more e-mail, calls, and texts than I did for any other award.”  But Franco said the Pudding Pot was not actually the most useful award he had ever garnered—he received a bong from High Times Magazine last year when he won their Stoner of the Year Award for his performance in “Pineapple Express.” He said he sent that award to his parents, who have yet to put the bong to its intended use.“It cracked in the mail, so they haven’t been able to use it,” he said.—Staff writer Lauren D.

General David H. Petraeus, chief of U.S. military operations in much of the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Middle East, will speak at this spring’s Reserve Officer Training Corps commissioning ceremonies at both Harvard and MIT, a top ROTC official confirmed earlier today.  
Petraeus, whose son Stephen will be commissioned at the MIT ceremony, has developed a “personal relationship” with a number of cadets from both schools while attending various ROTC events, according to MIT ROTC Commanding Officer Lt. Colonel Timothy J. Hall.
Cadets from Harvard, MIT, and other Boston-area schools train together on the MIT campus.    
The Harvard commissioning ceremony, set for June 3, has generally not drawn significant interest in years past. At the 2008 event, roughly 100 spectators gathered in Tercentenary Theater to see University President Drew G. Faust headline the list of speakers.
This year, Hall said, a group of Harvard cadets decided they wanted to invite Petraeus to speak at the commissioning ceremony, and Petraeus—who spoke at the Kennedy School in 2002—accepted the group’s offer.
Petraeus, who is head of U.S. Central Command and was named a runner-up for Time Magazine’s 2007 Person of the Year, oversaw multinational forces in Iraq from February 2007 until September of last year, and is often credited with effectively overseeing the implementation of the U.S. “surge” strategy in the Middle East. 
“I think he’s excited to make it a special day for all the Harvard guys and girls,” said Stephen H. Petraeus, who added that he had not spoken to his father about what he plans to say in his speech. 
“We’re very excited to have [Petraeus] coming because it means so much to our students,” Hall said. “As the commander of U.S. Central Command, he oversees areas that will be relevant to them as they move out into the Army.”
Harvard’s strained relationship with ROTC peaked when the program was banned from campus in 1969 amid student protests over the Vietnam War. 
In recent years, Harvard and other elite universities have barred military recruiters from their campuses due to the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which prohibits gay individuals from serving openly in the military.

There was no love in the air at the Bright Hockey Center on Valentine’s Day.  Instead, it was a hard-hitting, physical, and sometimes wild battle for the Harvard men’s hockey team (7-14-4, 7-7-4 ECAC) against its historical foe, No. 6 Cornell (15-6-4, 10-5-3, ECAC).The rivalry between the two teams is one of the oldest in intercollegiate competition, dating back to 1910. With bragging rights and crucial league points on the line, it was no surprise that both teams came onto the ice with their sticks swinging, ready to play.  The Crimson and the Big Red combined for 28 minutes in the box, taking penalties for roughing, high-sticking, and tripping, among other infractions.And despite Cornell’s overpowering offense, it was Harvard that came out on top for its biggest win of the season with effective special teams play.“I thought we did a lot of good things and when you play good teams, even when you do a lot of good things, they can put you under a lot of pressure,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.  “Cornell played an excellent game, and we have a lot of respect for them.” POWER PLAYDespite holding a 20-shot deficit to the Big Red on the night, the Crimson’s offensive unit was right on target when it did make attempts at net. The Crimson’s surge came in spite of playing against the nation’s stingiest goaltender in the Big Red’s Ben Scrivens.  Leading up to Saturday night’s game, Scrivens led the nation in save percentage at .948 and goals against average at 1.42. Special teams were huge for the team, as Harvard scored all four of its tallies on power play opportunities for a conversion rate of 0.667.Last night’s performance by the Crimson’s offensive unit was a step in the right direction, as the team has been well under 0.500 in the past five games in power play conversion.  Just take last week’s 5-1 loss to Yale as an example—Harvard was unable to take advantage of any of its man-advantage opportunities.Unsurprisingly, the Crimson’s success on the power play has been highly correlated with its ability to win games.  In each of Harvard’s seven wins this season, the Crimson’s power play conversion percentage has been greater than or equal to that of its opponents. PENALTY KILLThe Big Red outshot the Crimson 44-24 on the night.  The shot differential transpired entirely in the second and third periods, ironically the same time as when Harvard leapt ahead on the scoreboard. The somewhat oppositional statistics may be justified by the Crimson’s superb defense, which killed all seven of Cornell’s power play opportunities of the game. Anchoring Harvard’s defensive efforts was sophomore goaltender Ryan Carroll, who stopped 42 shots en route to the team’s 4-2 win. “In general your goaltenders arte always your best penalty killer and I think [Carroll] certainly was tonight,” Donato said.It was the second-year’s second 40-plus save night in just three games since he’s taken over the role of starting goaltender for the Crimson. Carroll made his starting debut in last week’s Beanpot consolation final against No. 15 Boston College. “I think Ryan [Carroll] has worked awfully hard in practice,” Donato said. “You know [he] deserved an opportunity. Now in his first three games, he’s grabbed the opportunity and played well.”On Saturday night, Carroll was forced to make some spectacular saves to keep Harvard in the game against a crushing Big Red offense.  Case in point: the second-year gloved a powerful slapshot during a Cornell power play late in the first period to keep the score even going into the break.Carroll’s ability to remain calm and focused, despite facing an over-ranked opponent and long-time rival in Cornell, contributed to the team’s narrow victory. “Being mentally prepared is most important I think, and I really was tonight,” Carroll said.  “Coach [Donato] tells us whoever’s playing well is going to keep playing.”—Staff writer Lucy D.

For the first time this season, the Crimson wrestlers (4-10, 1-2 Ivy) competed at home. In front of supportive and enthusiastic Harvard fans, the squad took on tough opponents  in American International College, Brown and Wagner.  On Friday night, Harvard recorded a decisive victory over AIC, winning eight of nine matches and outscoring the Yellow Jackets, 34-3.  The following afternoon, Harvard wrestled well against Brown, winning five of eight matches.  But despite strong performances the Crimson fell to the Bears 25-16, largely due to two forfeits.  Only a few hours after wrestling Brown on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard wrestlers rallied against Wagner, defeating the Seahawks, 33-10, and winning six of nine matches contested.Harvard coach Jay Weiss said that the weekend had ups and downs for the team. “I thought we did okay,” said Weiss after the final match on Saturday.  “We have been in our heavy training part of the season with tough practices the past week.”The Crimson have also suffered from critical absences, with heavyweight wrestlers Spencer DeSena and Andrew Knapp missing with staff infections, as well as Corey Jantzen (141 lbs.), who remains out with an injury. Harvard knew going into this weekend that individuals would have to step up and have stellar performances in order to compensate for the absence of these grapplers.  As they have all season, Harvard’s junior co-captains  No. 10 Louis Caputo (184) and No. 3 J.P. O’Connor (157) led the Crimson on the mat,  with undefeated weekends.“I can’t say enough about [the captains],” Weiss said. “I think they are the best in the country in their weights.”HARVARD 33, WAGNER 10Harvard hosted Wagner at the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday evening to complete its three-match weekend. Both teams forfeited the 125 weight class, and Wagner jumped to a 7-0 lead with wins at 133 and 141.The Crimson responded by taking five of the next six matches, with the most impressive performance coming from freshman Walter Peppelman (149), who pinned his opponent in only 9 seconds. O’Connor (24-2) followed suit, pinning his opposition in 55 seconds, Harvard extended its lead to 18-9 when Andy Olsen (174) earned a pin of his own in 2:40.Caputo (24-4) and rookie Sean Murphy (3-13) both wrestled up a weight class and still managed to close the door on the Seahawks.  Caputo wrestled at 197 lbs. and pinned his opponent in 41 seconds, while Murphy won by fall in 1:20.BROWN 25, HARVARD 19In the Saturday afternoon session, the Crimson gave the Bears a 12-point advantage by forfeiting two matches at 125 and 285 pounds. Although Harvard claimed the majority of bouts, the early deficit proved insurmountable.“I think we outwrestled them,” O’Connor said.  “We went out there and fought and I think it was pretty obvious that we were the better team.  If circumstances [were changed], the match would have turned out differently.”O’Connor, Caputo, and Peppelman (12-7) led the charge with two major decisions and a technical fall, giving the Crimson 13 critical points. Olsen fought through a tough bout to earn a 5-2 decision, and senior Tommy Picarsic (133) extended his winning streak to four bouts, but Harvard came up just short with losses at 141, 165, and 197.In bouts wrestled, the Crimson held a 19-13 edge over the Bears.HARVARD 34, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE 3 In Friday’s contest, the Crimson dominated the Yellow Jackets (7-18), winning eight of nine matches in its return to the MAC.Harvard has not wrestled at home in over a year, and cheers and chants from “team Louis” seemed to energize the grapplers in front of an excited home crowd.“I love ‘team Louis,’” said Caputo in reference to the purple-clad section of fans. “I wrestle so much better when everyone comes.”Peppelman and the co-captains began their undefeated weekend campaigns with convincing wins, while freshman Bryan Panzano (1-7) and senior Patrick Ziemnik picked up close decisions, 1-0 and 3-0 respectively.Freshman Johnny Motley (2-8) scored his second collegiate victory in stunning fashion with a 14-4 major decision over Gonzalo Carazo, joining Picarsic (7-2) and classmate Murphy in the win column.

It was another day of personal and team bests at Gordon Track on Saturday, where the Harvard women’s track team gained bragging rights over counterparts Yale and Princeton while the men’s team continued to build upon last week’s successes.
“It’s so exciting for us because we came really close to winning last year,” co-captain Ashlinn O’Callaghan said. “Princeton was indoor [Heptagonals] champion, and they were at the top of the league, so it just means so much to us to come in first and really beat them.” 
The women stole the show, winning the meet with a commanding 77 points. The team beat out Princeton by 18 points and Yale by 54. 
Co-captain Becky Christensen paved the way with the second all-time high jump in program history. She topped last week’s performance at the Battle of Beantown with a 1.91-meter leap that was not only impressive but also the third time this season that the ever-improving Christensen set a personal best. This was among 9-of-15 event wins for the Crimson women.
“It’s fun going out and keeping the momentum alive,” sophomore Claire Richardson said. “It’s especially motivating with Becky setting a personal record in the high jump and everybody giving it their all.”
Richardson also shared the spotlight as she won the 3000-meter run. She came out on top with a time of 9:30.30 over a heavily favored Princeton quartet. The sophomore provisionally qualified for the NCAA Championships next month and placed fifth on the Harvard all-time top-10 performance list.
The Crimson women also prevailed in the 60-meter dash, thanks to senior Favia Merritt and her time of 7.73, a personal best. Harvard swept the 60-meter hurdles, with Shannon Flahive, Dara Wilson, and Geneva Trotter coming in 1-2-3. All three have qualified for the ECAC Championships with their efforts. The team also towered above the rest in the long jump, taking the top four spots with senior Brittan Smith coming in first after leaping 5.7 meters. 
Two more ECAC Championship qualifying athletes include freshman Shannon Conway and sophomore Jamie Olson. Conway beat out the rest in the 400-meter dash with a time of 56.84, the fastest time by a Harvard female this year. Olson ran the 800-meter in 2:13.41 and placed second behind Yale. 
Harvard women finished the day off with two strong wins in the 4x400-meter and 4x800-meter events. 
The Crimson men came in third on Saturday with 32 points, a solid outing for a team that has been gaining confidence throughout the season after a weak campaign last year. 
“Last year, we were a bit further back from where we are this year, so I’m really glad to see that we’re closing the gap with two of the stronger teams in the league,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. 
The highlight of the day for the men was Nico Weiler’s personal-best—and a second-best in program history—effort in the pole vault. He cleared the bar at 5.20 meters, winning the event by .3 meters.  With the crowd and team cheering him on, he then attempted three times to break the program’s all-time record of 5.30 meters. 
“It was great, a lot of fun,” Weiler said. “I’m finally getting back in shape; I had a hamstring injury. Today was the first time I jumped well this year.”
Freshman Darcy Wilson ran a team best on the season, placing first in the 800-meter in 1:55.48. Classmate Steven Geloneck came in second in the 60-meter dash with a time of 6.99, the first time this season the freshman ran under seven seconds. Junior Jonathan Brito had his best jump of the season, placing fourth with 1.89 meters in the high jump. 
Captain Derek Jones had a fantastic meet, comfortably winning the 400-meter dash with a time of 49.12, thus qualifying for the IC4A D1 Championships. Jones was also pivotal in the 4x400-meter relay, where Harvard had its fastest time of the season, 3:18.77, but came in third overall. The Crimson also placed third in the 4x800-meter relay, clocking in at 8:06.46. 
“For the team, we’ve come a long way, especially since my freshman year,” Jones said. “We’ve really come to a point where we’re cohesive as a team. We’re supporting each other and posting some tremendous results. Personally, my training has been really great this year.”
Sophomore Dan Chenoweth lit up the track as he won the 3000-meter race with a time of 8:10:34, six seconds ahead of second place. He and captain Chas Gellespie, who came in fourth with 8:18:81, had IC4A qualifying times. 
As both teams huddled in the center of the track and celebrated the women’s performance, Harvard now sets its eyes on the Heptagonal Championships rapidly approaching in two weeks.

It’s still early in the season for the Harvard men’s tennis team, but judging by this weekend’s dramatic climaxes, it’s clear that every point is at stake.In a tournament of thrilling finishes, Harvard (4-1) captured the ECAC Men’s Indoor Tennis Championships hosted at the Murr Center. With two matches coming down to the wire, the tournament proved a early test of mettle for the Crimson. “Overall, we’re getting better playing under pressure, and that’s invaluable,” assistant coach Andrew Rueb said.   As the Crimson prepares to defend its Ivy League title, it showed healthy progress with a championship win in a pool that included Ancient Eight opponents as well as St. John’s (3-2) and Boston College.  HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 3With a quick turnaround after back-to-back victories in earlier rounds, Harvard defeated Columbia (4-2) to take the championship. Freshman Alistair Felton provided the clinching game with a 3-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-4 victory against Ekin Sezgen at No. 4.  “[Felton] doesn’t easily get daunted,” head coach Dave Fish said. “It’s a good attitude for tennis.  His attitude has been improving every week.”Harvard suffered an early setback as it lost the doubles point. At No. 2, junior Michael Hayes and Felton fell, 8-4, while the No. 1 partnership of senior Sasha Ermakov and sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans lost, 8-6, to Bogdan Borta and Mihai Nichifor. The Crimson quickly rebounded by taking the first three singles matches to lead, 3-1.  Ermakov equalized by upstaging Borta, 6-1, 6-3 at No. 2, and the Crimson took the lead when Omodele-Lucien won 7-6, 6-2 over Kevin Kung at No. 6. Mangham stretched Harvard’s advantage to 3-1 when he defeated Haig Schneiderman, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Columbia matched the Crimson’s resilience through wins for Nichifor (6-1, 4-6, 6-4) and John Wong (7-6, 7-6) to even the score at 3-3, before Felton’s dramatic win. “We were points away from playing in the third place match this morning,” Fish said. “I was very pleased that we got in right from the beginning of the singles and didn’t let Columbia develop a momentum.”HARVARD 4, PENN 3In Sunday’s semifinal, Chijoff-Evans led Harvard to victory after his decisive third-set tiebreaker gained the winning point against Penn (3-4).  After dropping the first set, 6-3, to the Quakers’ Hicham Laalej, Chijoff-Evans evened the match with a 7-6 (10-8) victory in the second set. In the final set, each player held serve until the tiebreaker—with Chijoff-Evans holding his nerve to win, 9-7, and clinch victory for the Crimson. “It was a tough match—he was a really good opponent and played a strong game,” Chijoff-Evans said.  “I just tried to step up my game, and Lady Luck was on my side.”    Harvard gained the advantage by winning two doubles matches. Davis Mangham and Aba Omodele-Lucien won 8-3 over Alex Vasin and Justen Roth, while Sasha Ermakov and Chijoff-Evans defeated Laalej and Phil Law 8-2. The Crimson took a quick 3-0 lead as No. 5 Mangham defeated Vasin, 6-2, 6-2, while No. 2 Ermakov beat Jonathan Boym (6-2, 6-3). Adam  Schwartz of Penn ousted Hayes (7-6, 7-6) in an emotional match, inspiring the Quakers to tie the score at 3-3. Law beat Felton (7-6, 7-5), and Jason Lin came from one set down against Omodele-Lucien to win in the third set (4-6, 6-4, 6-2), setting the stage for Chijoff-Evans’s late victory.  “It’s exciting college tennis at its best,” Rueb said.  HARVARD 4, ST. JOHN’S 0The Crimson set the tone in their first match of the tournament by defeating St. John’s 4-0 at the Murr Center on Saturday afternoon.   The Crimson built momentum through a strong performance in the doubles. No. 1 Ermakov and Chijoff-Evans defeated Derek Wallensteen and Stefan Nikolic, 8-3, while Hayes and Felton won, 8-6, against Pavel Cerny and Gustavo Loza to clinch the first point for Harvard. The Crimson proceeded to win its first three singles matches to clinch the 4-0 victory. No. 2 Ermakov won comfortably against Milo Hauk (6-2, 6-2) and No. 3 Hayes beat Cerny, 6-3, 6-4.  Felton wrapped up the winners by defeating Loza 6-4, 6-0 at No. 4.  While Fish was pleased with Harvard’s tournament performance, he stressed there was still plenty of room for improvement.“I’m satisfied at this checkpoint [in the season], but we haven’t gotten anywhere yet,” Fish said. “We’re on the right track.”
