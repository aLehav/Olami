After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On August  27, Fox News host Tucker Carlson made a rather spectacular accusation. Specifically, he charged “fanatics on the left” with trying to “erase the past.” Remarkably, the host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” was willing to charge his political opponents with a vast conspiracy to gaslight average Americans into forgetting unsavory parts of their national history. And Carlson is not alone. An agitated Victor Hanson, writing in the National Review, argued that liberals are trying to “erase memory.” Maine Governor Paul LePage asked rhetorically, “How can future generations learn if we’re going to erase history?”
Much of this is criticism of the modern movement advocating the removal of Confederate statues, and none of it is fair. Removing statues simply does not change history. Denazification in Germany involved the destruction of statues, buildings, symbols, and even grave sites. But even that process did not manage to erase the history of the National Socialist movement, which had already been recorded in books, other academic materials, and the collective memory of millions. The same can be said of Destalinization in the late 50s and De-Ba’athification after 2003. No one on either side of this debate claims that slavery and the American Civil War never happened, or that they can simply be erased. Rather, progressives argue against the aggressive valorization of a brief, parasitic, undemocratic, and treasonous nation.
Because this is what statues do, they valorize. In 1939, the pro-Nazi “German American Bund” staged an “Americanization” rally in Madison Square Garden. The rally was attended by 20,000 people, and it registers as a fairly important historical event. The Bund also had 70 regional divisions and 20 youth camps. In the modern day, there are no memorials to the German American Bund because their Nazi ideology is among the foulest in world history and it would be inappropriate to commemorate its American form with a statue. The Bund’s history has not been erased; it is certainly remembered in books and articles. It is, however, not honored or celebrated.
In the same sense, removing statues will not change the history of the United States and the Confederacy, which is studied all over the world. The real gaslighting in this country occurs in our schools, where millions of American children are force-fed falsehoods at an astonishing rate. In 2010, the Texas Board of Education approved a textbook which openly condemns the separation of church and state, minimizes the internment of Japanese Americans, and lists Moses as a founding father. That same textbook refers to African slaves as “workers.” In Alabama, biology teachers are legally obligated to deemphasize evolution.
When Texas conservatives wanted to deemphasize slavery, racism, and authoritarianism in the history of the Civil War, they did not erect new statues. They simply changed their textbooks, which presently refer to chattel slavery not as a cause of the war, but rather a “side issue.” Textbooks are not statues. They are not designed to emphasize the parts of history with which we are most comfortable. They are designed to teach children facts. When they are pumped with ahistorical nonsense, the result is widespread public ignorance. If future generations cannot remember or understand the past, the culprit will be cynical political dishonesty in the education system, not imaginary liberal kulturkampf.
Harvard is by no means isolated from all this. After the University announced a plan to remove the phrase “stock of the Puritans” from the lyrics to “Fair Harvard,” the Internet rang with the anguished cries of aggrieved conservatives, furious at our political correctness. Fox even ran an interview with a Harvard student, going so far as to accuse Harvard of “trying to undo history.” Claims like this are mind-flayingly vapid. Just like statues, songs like “Fair Harvard” are commemorative and memorial. No one at the University is busily tearing the Puritans from the historical record. Rather, the Inclusion and Belonging Task Force reasonably decided that tying Harvard’s future exclusively to the “stock of the Puritans” is unwise.
There is also the question of whether disadvantaged populations even have any motive to delete history. American chattel slavery, for example, destroyed family trees; it is the reason most American black people have only a vague sense of their true heritage. So why would we want our white countrymen to forget that their ancestors worked ours to death? Between 1877 and 1950 there were 3,959 documented lynchings of black people in the United States. None of this can be undone or forgotten. The removal of Confederate statues, renaming of buildings, and changing of faculty titles is an effort to stop the glorification of America’s darkest crimes, not some vast conspiracy to rewrite and sanitize the past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 31, 2017 at 8:41 p.m.
The Harvard Athletics Department will create “a protocol for receiving and acting on complaints of gender inequities” and provide “conflict resolution training” for coaches and staff as part of a wide-ranging set of reforms born from a series of scandals in the last year.
In an email sent to student-athletes Thursday afternoon, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise detailed the changes the Department will make to address concerns among student athletes about gender equity and administrative responsiveness.
Students athletes will go through a program that “includes important conversations about values-based leadership, sexual harassment and violence prevention, conflict resolution, and equity, diversity and inclusion” in the fall. Coaches and staff will also go through a professional development program that focuses on “unconscious bias training, conflict resolution and sexual assault and harassment prevention.”
“There are areas where we need to do better,” Scalise wrote. “They include very strong team-centered cultures and a corresponding lack of an overarching departmental culture, a lack of streamlined departmental response to resolving conflicts, and gender inclusion and equity issues.”
The announcement comes after a department-wide cultural review, which included a survey sent to all student athletes, coaches, and Athletics administrators and staff as well as focus groups and individual interviews. According to Scalise, over 850 student athletes, coaches, and staff completed the survey and 350 students and other individuals participated in the interviews and focus groups.
The Athletics Department began the review—conducted by consultants from the National Consortium of Academics in Sports— in the spring after a series of high-profile scandals involving the men’s varsity soccer team and the men’s varsity cross country team. Last October, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team produced a “scouting report” that contained sexually-explicit comments about incoming members of the women’s soccer team. University President Drew G. Faust asked the Office of General Counsel to conduct a review of the situation, and the office later found that such scouting reports were annual and continued into the 2016 season. The Athletics Department announced that they had cancelled the remainder of the soccer team’s season in November 2016.
Days after the soccer team’s “scouting report” came to light, reports revealed that past men’s cross country teams had created and circulated spreadsheets that included comments about members of the women’s cross country team, some of which were sexually explicit. The team was placed on “athletic probation” after an OGC investigation found that the 2016 team did not “denigrate or objectify particular women.”
While The Crimson’s reporting spurred the initial review, Scalise wrote that it eventually expanded to take a broader view of the Department’s functions.
Student athletes, coaches, and staff also voiced concerns about gender equity and inclusion in the department. Statistics kept by the U.S. Department of Education show that head coaches of female sports make on average $34,000 less than their counterparts on men’s teams. Assistant coaches on female teams also made significantly less than assistant coaches for men’s teams.
“Participants in the focus groups expressed concerns in several key areas, including facilities, social media coverage and other forms of institutional support, as well as differential recognition for men’s and women’s coaches, staff, and student-athletes,” Scalise wrote in his email.
Issues of gender equity came to a head last semester when several members of the women’s rugby program wrote a series of letters to Scalise and University President Drew G. Faust charging that Harvard does not adequately support women’s sports programs, violating anti-gender discrimination law Title IX.
The Department will also address how it receives complaints from athletes. Scalise wrote that the student-athlete handbook now outlines the process and resources for students who want to express concerns. In addition to the new conflict resolution trainings for coaches and staff, the Department will also discuss conflict resolution with all the teams.
“Some of you expressed that you felt the athletic department was either not responsive or slow to resolve conflicts that occur in a team environment,” Scalise wrote. “Others of you reported feeling uncertain on how to bring forward concerns, or felt the policies currently in place were not effectively followed by athletic administrators.”
Last year, the women’s cross country and track and field programs also came under scrutiny after a number of former and current student athletes, faculty, and athletics staff raised concerns about the team’s divided culture and distance coach Patrick Wales-Dinan. After eight former athletes called on Scalise to remove Wales-Dinan from the program, Harvard’s office of human resources began working with an outside factfinder to investigate the team’s culture—a process that some athletes criticized as biased and imperfect.
Head Coach Jason S. Saretsky announced in late June that Wales-Dinan would be stepping down from his position.
In addition to concerns about gender equity and the complaints process within the department, Scalise wrote that student athletes overall expressed feeling disconnected from the Department at large. Student athletes also called for more support from coaches and staff to help navigate their “dual roles as students and student-athletes.”
Scalise announced that in response to this feedback, the Department will host community discussions with student athletes in order to “connect values to day-to-day experiences of our team and department.” The Athletics Department has tasked the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee to work with the intramural programs in the Houses and the Office of Student Life to host activities for all students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 criticized a recent proposal that seeks to entirely eliminate Harvard’s undergraduate social groups as “not effective” in an interview Thursday.
In July, a committee tasked with reconsidering the College’s current social group policy—which penalizes members of single-gender final clubs, sororities, and fraternities—recommended that all social groups, regardless of gender makeup, be “phased out.”
Sachee, a member of the all-female Bee Club, was one of six students to sit on the committee. After the committee released its recommendations over the summer, The Crimson reported that its ultimate recommendation had received only seven votes in a straw poll of the 27 members. 
Reiterating criticisms of the College’s crackdown on single-gender groups she first raised during her campaign for the UC presidency, Sachee said Thursday that she believes the proposed blanket social group ban would unfairly penalize the social groups “that are not really causing the huge issues.”
Khansarinia agreed. “It won’t work and it’s an aggressive policy which kind of seems just like a policy just to do something,” he said, adding that issues like exclusivity and a “lack of social spaces” would not be remedied by a social group ban.
The committee will consult with faculty and students before releasing a final revised report on September 25. Sachee said she hopes the committee will first examine the results of the current policy, which prohibits students in single-gender organizations from holding club leadership positions and sports captaincies as well as from receiving endorsements for some fellowships.
Since the policy was announced, four formerly single-gender groups—the Sab Club, Alpha Epsilon Pi, the Seneca, and the Oak Club—have gone co-ed. On Tuesday, the previously all-male Delphic Club and the Bee Club announced they would begin sharing membership and a clubhouse.
Sachee said she hopes groups that have gone co-ed are given time to transition to gender-neutral membership.
“There are some groups who over the summer, last year, last semester, and in this coming semester have made some changes,” she said. “We hope that the College will give them enough time to actually see this through.”
Looking ahead, Sachee and Khansarinia said they plan to run freshmen welcoming events for students from marginalized groups, part of a joint effort between the UC and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations to fund programming for affinity groups during the first few weeks of school.
“It’s hopefully going to be a really great way to welcome freshmen on campus into the many different communities here,” Sachee said.
The two also said they hope students will utilize the Council’s centralized guide for student groups’ comp processes, a campaign tenet that made its debut this spring.
Sachee also said she and Khansarinia were pleased to see the College agree to fund a pre-orientation program for incoming students from marginalized backgrounds a semester after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a proposal for a similar program for low-income and first-generation students.
The UC will convene a general meeting this Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Harvard Law School faculty members are pushing for the Department of Education to revise Obama-era Title IX standards governing how universities respond to sexual harassment and assault on campus.
In a memo submitted to the Department of Education last week, Law School professors Janet E. Halley, Elizabeth D. Bartholet ’62, and Jeannie Suk Gersen and lecturer Nancy Gertner called on the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights to reevaluate the standards put forth in the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter. That directive instructed all colleges and universities receiving federal funds to use a preponderance of evidence standard—a lower standard of proof—in sexual assault cases and established a broader definition of what could be considered sexual harassment. In 2014, Harvard adopted a preponderance of the evidence standard for sexual harassment cases.
The Law School faculty in their memo—entitled “Fairness for All Students under Title IX”—argued that as a result of the letter, colleges’ definitions of sexual wrongdoing now “go way beyond accepted legal definitions of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.”
“I think that it is a disgrace that Harvard University adopted one of the most chaotic definitions of sexual harassment I have ever seen, one of the worst procedures in the country, and has stuck by these after years of criticism,” Halley said.
A University spokesperson said the Title IX Office had not seen the memo and declined to comment. 
Halley, Bartholet, Suk Gerson, and Gertner were among the 28 Law School faculty who in 2014 called for Harvard withdraw its then-new sexual harassment policy in an open letter published in the Boston Globe. In 2015, the Law School broke from the University in crafting and adopting its own set of sexual harassment procedures.
Halley—who led the effort to publish the memo and has been a vocal opponent of Harvard’s and national sexual assault policies—said she was motivated to write the memo as the Trump administration’s Education Department reconsiders its approach to combating sexual assault on campus. Buzzfeed reported Tuesday that the department is considering putting the Dear Colleague letter up for public comment, potentially opening its standards up to revision.
Bartholet said she sees two fundamental issues with the current Title IX policies: the “overbroad” definition of sexual assault and the process of determining guilt in these cases.
“These policies have meant that accused students have, on many occasions, been subjected to a process that really does not give them a fair chance to establish what the real facts of the incident were,” Bartholet said.
Though the Education Department has not currently committed to altering any campus sexual assault guidelines, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in July that the department should act “quickly” to change Title IX policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the first class of students subject to a College policy penalizing members of social clubs arrives on campus, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is gearing up for a semester of meetings likely to be dominated by debate over the policy’s future.
As it currently stands, the controversial policy prohibits College students—starting with the class of 2021—who are members of a final club or Greek organization from holding certain club leadership positions or athletic team captaincies or being recommended for certain postgraduate fellowships. But a July report by a committee of faculty, staff, and students tasked with reexamining the policy recommended a more drastic option—phasing the groups out entirely.
Following the July report, former Dean of the College and outspoken critic of the policy Harry R. Lewis ’68 re-introduced a faculty motion signed by 21 professors and stating that Harvard College shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization.”
Getting to a full Faculty vote has the potential to be a lengthy process: According to Faculty Council member and professor David L. Howell, it is likely that Lewis’s motion will not go to a vote until the December Faculty meeting. Per Faculty meeting rules, any “substantive” motions must be reviewed by the Docket Committee, which sets the agenda for each meeting. Once approved, motions traditionally come before the Faculty for the first time—but only for debate. Motions are then eligible to be voted on at subsequent meetings by eligible Faculty members.
The Faculty will convene for the first time on October 3, meaning that—so long as typical procedures are followed—the earliest opportunity professors will have to vote on Lewis’s motion is the November 7 meeting.
However, Howell predicted that Lewis’s motion would be introduced at the November meeting, because the Faculty Council has not had a chance to discuss the motion. The Faculty Council—FAS’s highest elected body—traditionally reviews motions and, at times, talks with their sponsors before they are presented to the full body.
The 18-member  Faculty Council met for the first time on August 30 and did not discuss Lewis’ motion, though Howell said that they may discuss the motion at their next meeting on September 13.
While Faculty meetings are rarely attended by a majority of FAS, the sanctions debate has proven to be a draw for many professors. During last year’s open discussions—which spanned the Nov. 2016 meeting, when the motion was first introduced, and the December meeting, where a vote was postponed after discussion ran over time—some Faculty members had to stand outside or sit on the floor.
Some professors who are on leave from the University for the semester, including Psychology professor Steven Pinker, Biology professor David Haig and Computer Science professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher, told The Crimson that they will return to Harvard to cast their votes in favor of Lewis’s motion.
In the meantime, Faculty members have been actively debating the policy in an online forum created earlier this summer.
A repeat of tense debates over the future of Harvard social life has the potential to postpone other pressing legislative items for the Faculty, including a revamped quantitative reasoning requirement in the new general education program. The new general education requirement must be approved before the 2018-2019 school year.
“My guess would be that it will be another exciting year of Faculty meetings,” Howell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi announced on Wednesday evening that they will resign from their position as Leverett House’s Faculty Deans in June, coinciding with their 20th year at the helm of the upperclassmen residence.
Currently one of the longest-serving pairs of Faculty Deans, the Georgis were appointed House Masters of Leverett in 1998 and chose to take the role after their own children had moved out of their home. During their tenure in Leverett, the couple oversaw renovations to McKinlock Hall, part of an ongoing Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ House Renewal project.
Affectionately known as “Chief” to Leverett residents, Howard Georgi became a professor of physics in 1980 and has also served as the department’s undergraduate director of studies since 2002. Ann Georgi, whose House nickname is “Coach,” previously worked as the undergraduate research advisor for life sciences.
Howard Georgi is a fellow for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and has received numerous accolades for his research. He is credited with publishing several particle physics theorems including the Georgi–Glashow model.
“This House became the solution to our empty nest problem,” Howard Georgi wrote in his prepared remarks at a House meeting. “Our goal at Leverett has always been to make the House a home away from home for you students.”
Students expressed their affection for the Georgis’ role in developing many of the Leverett’s House traditions, including serving “monkey bread” in the Faculty Dean residence and holding Wednesday’s Physics Night during Brain Break, the College’s late-night snack service.
“A lot of events of the Lev community are tied to events that Chief and Coach spearheaded,” said Leverett House resident Erik C. Owen ’18. “The future Lev will have a completely different vibe depending on how those institutions like physics night and monkey bread transitions over with the new Faculty Deans.”
The Georgis will be the fourth pair of Faculty Deans to step down in the past three years. Currier, Dunster, and Mather Houses have all undergone searches for new Faculty Deans as couples retire or move on to other pursuits. Howard Georgi said that he intends to continue serving as a professor in the Physics Department after he departs his Faculty Dean post.
Alec K. Reed ’18, a co-chair of Leverett's House Committee, praised the Georgis involvement in HoCo activities and their dedicated tenure to the House. He added that the House Committee is excited to make the most of the Faculty Deans’ last year.
“The HoCo is excited to continue building a strong community in Lev,” Reed said. “Chief and Coach have been very supportive of all our endeavors.”
Cynthia Luo ’19, another Leverett House resident, said she was “heartbroken” to hear about the Georgis’ resignation, but hopes that Leverett residents will be encouraged to attend more House events for the Faculty Deans’ last year.
“Chief and Coach are at the center of making Leverett feel like home for so many students,” Luo added. “They'll be dearly missed by the Lev Community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students shopping one of Harvard’s most popular undergraduate courses will arrive in Sanders Theater tomorrow to a changed Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
For one thing, course staff are now recommending that enrollees actually go to class.
That is one of several changes to course policies that CS50 head instructor David J. Malan ’99, who has led the class through a massive expansion in size and popularity in recent years, made over the summer. He announced the changes in a “FAQ” page he circulated on Facebook Wednesday evening.
CS50 has long been one of the most popular classes at Harvard—but it has also been one of the most controversial. Last year, more than 60 students—roughly ten percent of total enrollees—came before Harvard’s Honor Council to face charges of academic dishonesty. And over the past few years, Malan and the University have filed contradictory applications to trademark the course.
In one change, CS50 will now be graded on a “Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory” basis by default, though students can elect to take the course for a letter grade if they wish.
Malan wrote in an emailed statement Thursday evening that this particular update was inspired, at least in part, by his personal experience with Computer Science while an undergraduate at Harvard. Back then, he wrote, he thought the field “intimidating” and “one to beware.”
“Were it not for Pass/Fail… I myself probably wouldn’t have taken CS50 as a sophomore, let alone concentrated in CS ultimately,” he wrote. “Taking CS50 Pass/Fail empowered me to explore a world beyond my comfort zone and, in turn, altered my academic trajectory.”
Students are now “encouraged” to physically attend the course’s taped weekly lectures, according to the two-page document. Malan had previously tweaked the course policies in fall 2016 to make lecture attendance optional. Attendance is now also expected at every discussion section until the first mid-semester exam.
Malan wrote Thursday that previous CS50 students had reported the online presentations lacked the energy of in-person lectures.
“We received enough feedback anecdotally that the new format lacked the dynamism of years past that we decided to bring back live lectures this fall,” he wrote.
A year after the unusually high levels of cheating in the course, Malan is requiring CS50 enrollees to attend an orientation meeting where course staff will offer advice on “how to do well in CS50” and “how to navigate issues of academic honesty,” according to the FAQ sheet.
Roughly 20 former CS50 students and course staff said last semester they thought the course’s collaboration policy and academic integrity guidelines were too vague and may have led some students to cheat unintentionally.
Malan wrote in his emailed statement that all changes—the new orientation sessions included—are “unrelated” to the high levels of cheating in CS50 last fall.
“Most of these are longstanding visions or evolutions of past design decisions,” he wrote. “The hope with these orientation sessions is to provide students, first years especially, with a road map for fall term.”
Malan added that CS50’s demographic has consistently grown younger over the past decade. The 2016 fall class was majority freshmen, according to Malan.
CS50 features work-intensive problem-sets, and code for some of these assignments is available online. In 2016, the course included a weekly taped problem-set walkthrough in addition to a weekly taped lecture, but this year the course will only meet once a week. The problem-set policy has also changed slightly.
For at least one former CS50 staffer, the changes to the course signal Malan’s willingness to solve problems through experimentation.
“Seems like he’s continuing to experiment and learn as I think he should and does relatively well,” said former CS50 teaching fellow Mark D. Grozen-Smith ’15. “I’m glad that we have innovation alive in such an impactful, high-demand class.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks before the start of the season, a single question looms for Harvard football: Can the team shake off the dust from last season—which ended with a disastrous two-game losing streak—and claim a fourth Ivy League title in five years?
Late this summer, Ancient Eight pundits combined to produce a preseason poll. Together, they delivered a resounding answer for the Crimson: no one knows.
For just the third time in Ivy League history, two teams tied in the annual projection. Princeton and Harvard both received 120 points, although the Tigers received slightly more first-place votes (six) than the Crimson (five).
The deadlock leaves the Ancient Eight in a state of uncertainty heading into competition. Further complicating the picture is the presence of Penn, which placed a closed third with 110 points and five first-place votes. Yale landed in a more distant fourth.
This year marks the 144th season of the Crimson football. The past decade has brought especially intense pleasures. From 2014 to 2016, Harvard claimed three straight championships. And over the last 16 years, the Crimson set a conference record by earning at least seven wins each season.
Last season disrupted this dominance, as the Bulldogs defeated Harvard in the final game of the season. This outcome not only shattered a nine-year win streak in the rivalry but also butted the Crimson out of first place. Princeton and the Quakers shared the banner.
In 2017, Harvard returns over half its starters from last year. Among this cohort is top passer Joe Viviano, top rusher Semar Smith, and top tackler Luke Hutton. All three are seniors. This combination pairs with ferocious cornerbacks and safeties.
"Defensively, I think our back end will be a veteran group,” said coach Tim Murphy during a conference call. “We're really excited about our secondary.”
This group, however, faces a tough string of challenges in the year ahead. Last season, the Tigers started the talented tandem of Chad Kanoff and John Lovett at quarterback. A traditional passer, Kanoff recorded two interceptions in his final eight games and landed on the All-Ivy second team. Meanwhile, Kanoff—who is a do-it-all athlete—made history by racking up 31 total scores, more than five teams overall. For his efforts, he earned an All-American nod.
Kanoff and Lovett return as seniors now. And they come back with the mission of claiming an outright championship—something no team has accomplished since 2014.
In order to do so, Princeton must get past two-time champion Penn. Although media members projected the Quakers as a third-place finisher, this designation may not mean much—in 2015 and 2016, Penn won the title despite not finishing at the top of the preseason poll.
There are internal reasons, too, why the Crimson will face a tough climb to the championship. This offseason, Harvard lost a number of key seniors. Gone is tight end Anthony Firkser, who led all pass-catchers last year with seven touchdowns. The Jets brought him to training camp this year. Joining him in the NFL is Max Rich, a 6’7” offensive lineman who anchored the Crimson offensive line last year. Harvard will miss these stars sorely.
Still, the start of the season will bring lesser competition, as the Crimson faces several bottom-feeders before battling the Killer P’s. In the preseason poll, Dartmouth and Brown earned fifth and sixth, respectively. Columbia and Cornell rounded out the league with 38 and 36 points.
Previously, Harvard has beaten up on this lesser competition. In the last three years, the team has not lost once to these four programs.
And anyway, these early predictions have limited value. In the past 40 polls, the media has correctly predicted just 12 champions.
“The big thing is that we have experience this year,” captain Luke Hutton said. “We didn’t have it last year. Experience is your biggest ally. When you have guys who have played 10 games coming back, it’s huge for how well you’re going to play.”

They’ve trained harder and smarter, and are even more focused and hungry than they were last year. The Harvard men’s soccer team, after a strong performance last season in which it was one of the strongest teams in the Ivy League, is poised to come out strong in tomorrow’s season and home opener against Xavier Friday afternoon.
This non-conference match will be the first test of strength and a time to work out any kinks for the Crimson, which will be led by co-captains and defenders Eric Gylling and Justin Crichlow. This year’s squad is a relatively young one, with more than half of the team made up of underclassmen, including six new members in the incoming class.
Despite the newcomers adjusting is the Crimson’s dynamic, the team returns has four of its five top goal scorers from the previous year, including sophomore midfielder Matthew Glass and senior midfielder Christian Sady, and a strong defense led by senior goalie Kyle Parks, who played in every game last season and averaged 1.22 goals against and six shutouts.
The Musketeers (1-1, 0-0 Big East), which have already begun their season, will be coming into the game off an overtime loss against Loyola Chicago and a 3-0 win over Drake. It will meet the Crimson for the first time at Ohiri Field on their first road trip of the year,
While the Crimson has a solid defense and prolific goal scorers, they will have to prepare to defend a team they have never faced before. Xavier, which too is a young team, also appears to have a high-octane offense. Sophomore Samson Sergi, senior Matt Vasquenza, and junior Cam Taylor, who was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Week, have been the team’s leading scorers so far.
Even against a strong team, the Crimson is known to hold its own and be a tough team to beat at home, with a 17-5-3 record since the 2013-2014 season. There is no doubt that the well-rested team will do everything it can to ensure that it starts the season off on the right foot.
