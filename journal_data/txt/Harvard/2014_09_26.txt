After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Inspired by the Skimm. All the things that you missed in TV, movies, books, and more. Warning: spoilers ahead.
Quote: “Final thing: (then I am gonna do some yoga): how come I am not  ‘an angry black woman’ the many times Meredith (or Addison!) rants? @nytimes” - Shonda Rhimes on Friday via her twitter. Good question.
A Scandal About ‘Scandal’
Alessandra Stanley, a reporter for The New York Times, recently wrote an article in anticipation of the new series “How to Get Away with Murder”,saying, “When Shonda Rhimes writes her autobiography, it should be called ‘How to Get Away with Being an Angry Black Woman.’” Stanley later defended her article on BuzzFeed after receiving backlash on Twitter and sparking many response articles, but it appears the damage has been done. People everywhere remain displeased over the article.
All of this controversy has overshadowed the fact that “Scandal” recently released a teaser for their new season, which premieres on Sept. 25, the same night as the exciting new series led by Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder. While fans may have been a little uncertain about the direction “Scandal” would take after Olivia jetted off with Jake, the trailer has reaffirmed that the reins are in good hands. It seems like Shonda’s still got it. Expect this new season to be a firecracker.
Freaks and (No) Geeks
“American Horror Story” is coming back for its fourth season, “Freak Show,” premiering on Oct. 8. The studio released a few snippets a couple of weeks ago to appease eager fans and recently debuted a full length trailer. These spine-tingling appetizers introduced viewers to this season’s terrifyingly grotesque new villain  “Twisty the Clown” and revealed some of the cast, including fan favorite Jessica Lange in her new role as a former cabaret star turned show manager. Audiences are also highly anticipating the addition of the world’s smallest woman, Jyoti Amge, to the cast and the return of Naomi Grossman, who will reprise her role as Pepper from season two.
Hodor No More?
That’s right—according to actor Kristian Nairn, who plays Hodor, both Bran and his giant companion will be absent from the upcoming season of “Game of Thrones.” While viewers might be saddened by this news, anyone who has read the books knows fans won’t miss much, as the loveable pair spends the next few books wandering rather uneventfully through the North. While these characters will be missed, Tywin Lannister may make an unexpected return. In a recent interview with MTV, actor Charles Dance, who plays the role of the recently deceased Tywin Lannister, hinted that we “haven’t seen the last of [him].”
What to say to your friend who’s a Snapchat addict...
You’re not alone. Snapchat has given us a peek not only into our friends’ lives but also in major events like the World Cup. With its over 200-second-long story submitted from everyone from members of the public to celebrities, the fashion industry is now also following the footsteps of teens across America and started Snapchatting sneak peeks and behind-the-scenes of NYC’s recent fashion week. It seems fitting that this ever-mutable industry has adopted Snapchat to capture its ephemeral events.
What to say to your friend who wants to be a triple threat… 
Try following in the footsteps of model-turned-actress Cara Delevingne, who just landed the lead role of Margo in an adaptation of John Green’s novel “Paper Towns.” In fact, the fashion icon, renowned for her signature eyebrows, has been building her acting resume since 2012, but this will be her first time starring in a major motion picture
What to say to your friend who’s had a Kit-Kat but still needs a break...
Don’t bother getting out of bed. “Gilmore Girls” is coming to a computer screen near you starting Oct. 1, courtesy of Netflix. No judgement from the rest of us, who will also probably curl up with Rory and Lorelai during midterm week to de-stress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a long time, I have tried to stay away from writing about music. I love music, I make a lot of it, and I would like to think I have some handle on how it works. Its power lies in the emotional connections it creates—and that power can be diminished by any attempt to put pen to paper and talk about it in a meaningful way. It gets diluted in a slippery slope of harsh reviews, personal tastes, and comparison of artists. And yet, here I am, about to introduce you to my column on albums, leaving you feeling confused about my change of heart.
The fact is, music is changing. I have been consuming music ever since I bought my first CD at age six (Yes, it was a Baha Men CD. Yes, I am embarrassed. No, I do not still own it). I went through all of the phases of developing an appreciation for music: rummaging through old boxes of my dad’s classic rock vinyl, redeeming the iTunes gift cards that invariably came every Christmas and birthday, examining the first generation of mp3 players, mourning the loss of LimeWire, making the trip to Urban to buy a brand-new, old-fashioned record player for my dorm.  I have conformed to many trends in music (as I write this, I am listening to my “Sundays” playlist on Spotify), and yet I have gone defiantly against the grain in other ways—my dad’s vinyls from the ’70s made the trek to Harvard with me.
As a musician and a lover of music, what is scary is the prospect of music changing to a point I can no longer recognize. While I do not want to grow up to be the parent who sneers at his own kids for listening to “that crap they put on the radio now,” (okay, the reference to radio alone will probably make it even worse), nor the grandparent who goes to Walmart asking if they “sell Youtubes there,” I want to hold onto the good things that have come out of the history of music and how we listen to it. For me, that means that as trends towards digitalization, singles, and personalized playlists become the norm, the album as an art form should not just be another fad or retro relic.
Albums are unique in that they serve not only as a mode of compilation of several smaller parts but also as a finished product with a unified aesthetic, greater than the sum of its parts. In this tension, there is a distinctive type of experience—splurging to purchase an entire digital download or vinyl copy of lesser-known songs, committing to listening to 40 or 50 minutes of music by one artist in the order that the artist intended, reading through the liner notes. Only when you have this experience do you start to appreciate the unique beauty that accompanies it—bringing together songs of different tempos, keys, and moods, understanding the nuances of an artist or band, or simply uncovering the larger trends in emotion and intention that inevitably bleed into music written and recorded within a narrowing range of time.
“Okay,” you may say. “Great. But what is the point of writing about it?”  I am not in a position to tell you to run out and buy a record player and neglect your homework for the next few hours by putting on “Abbey Road” or “channel ORANGE.”  Nor am I trying to say that, because I call myself a musician, your reasons for not caring about the future well-being of the album are less valid than my feelings to the contrary. What I would like to do, though, is force you to zoom out of the latest trends or technologies and give you a way to look at popular music in the grand scheme, with an eye towards where things are headed down the road.  Yes, you will have to do it through my eyes, and you will inevitably have to take my tastes and personal experience with music into account.  But I will try my best to look at a wide range of things—Kanye to The Killers, albums to singles, chart-toppers to B-side flops—as I talk about what makes albums different, why their purpose and position in music has evolved, and whether or not they can be saved going forward. In the end, my goal is not to change your tastes (although if you are really into Nickelback, we might have a problem). Instead I want to look at music in a way that helps me understand why I fell in love with the album and that helps you understand why you “do music” the way you do—and hopefully I will able able to convince enough Baha Men lovers, Nickelback haters, and obsessive Urban Outfitters shoppers to join me.

More than a decade after the release of “Drukqs,” his gargantuan fifth album, electronic musician Aphex Twin has released “Syro,” a highly anticipated 12-track work. Richard David James, the elusive man behind Aphex Twin, promoted Syro by flying a lime-green blimp over London, making an announcement on the deep web browser Tor, and listing the 138 pieces of music equipment used on the album—all signs that “Syro” would be one eccentric, hectic collection of beats. Long-deprived fans of James waited with anticipation to see what sort of outlandish sound Aphex Twin spent the last 13 years crafting.
But when listening to Syro, “outlandish” isn’t the first word that comes to mind. Yes, the album is inventive and enchanting—but not explicitly bizarre. Other than song names like “4 bit 9d api+e+6” and the occasional series of futuristic bleeps, Syro doesn’t aim to alienate or shock its audience. Rather, unlike its predecessor “Drukqs,” it presents a collection of unified, balanced tracks that can fade into the background just as easily as they can captivate listeners with every beat.
While “Drukqs” tossed listeners between hyperactive techno tracks and minimalist piano solos, “Syro” is laced together by elements of the breakbeat genre and soothing synth undertones found in nearly every song. “minipops 67,” the first song on the album, announces this theme immediately, launching into foot-tapping percussion before James adds subtle layers of humming synth, whispers, and delicate piano notes. “produk 29” takes on a similar form, starting with a heavy bass line and progressing into a gentle rhythm of beeps, electronic tones, and spoken words.
This isn’t to say that “Syro” is repetitive or tedious. In fact, given the complexity of James’s instruments and beats, it’s amazing “Syro” achieves such a sense of unity. Aphex Twin’s brilliance is evident in the way he combines his 137 instruments into one cohesive album, interweaving them into tracks made unique by nuances in rhythm and synthetic tones. “XMAS_EVET10,” the album’s 10-minute-long second song, never seems to drag and is far more hypnotizing than it is mind-numbing. It flows patiently through changes in tempo, taking its time to introduce new layers of ambient sound, all while leaving the listener wondering which direction the song will take next. Even “180db_,” defined by one repeating, rhythmic theme, engages listeners in the twists and turns of its quieter melodies.
The album’s single departure from its throbbing techno elements is the final track, “aisatsana.” With one of the only articulable song titles on “Syro,” “aisatsana” is composed of a gentle series of piano chords interspersed with nature sounds. Perhaps meant to recall the quieter moments of “Drukqs,” perhaps meant to calm the senses after the rhythmic agitation of preceding songs, “aisatsana” is an unsatisfying ending. Although the album so expertly manages to find a common ground between the two rival descriptors “ambient” and “techno,” “aisatsana” falls too squarely in the ambient camp and fails to push the boundaries of either genre.
But the inclusion of fragile “aisatsana” is more than made up for by “CIRCLONT6A” and “CIRCLONT14,” the energetic highlights of the album. Brimming with frenzied beats and beeps, the CIRCLONTs make it tough to decide between dancing and focusing on decoding the endless layers of sound. “CIRCLONT14,” the eerier of the pair, deftly weaves a haunting melody with the song’s restless foreground. “CIRCLONT6A” embraces the restless, taming it into one ambient piece.
James is known to recoil at the label of Intelligent Dance Music (IDM), the term so often used to describe his work. But it’s hard to deny that “Syro” is indeed intelligent: balancing Aphex Twin’s distinctive ambient feel with the frenzy of multiple drum machines and weaving a plethora of man-made sounds into a cohesive, digestible album is no easy feat. After his 13-year hiatus, 43-year-old Richard James proves that the way to push electronic music forward isn’t by searching for the ultra-bizarre, but by taming and combining the sounds we know into a work as mesmerizing as “Syro.”

“He dresses like a boxtroll but looks like a boy!” says the man who has been hung upside down from the ceiling. He’s swinging back and forth, long beard and hair blowing, and he’s cackling madly. Good thing he’s clay animated, too, because he’s been hanging upside down for 10 years and it’s likely that this sort of treatment would kill a regular human. Despite all the extra blood in his head, the crazy man has pointed out the central conflict in the animated movie “The Boxtrolls”: the main character struggles with a dual identity of boxtroll and boy. To save himself and his boxtroll family, he must learn to accept both identities and to motivate others to stand up for themselves as well.
“The Boxtrolls,” based on an illustrated novel by Alan Snow, is as much a self-acceptance story as it is an offbeat adventure tale. The production company, Laika, also produced the animated films “ParaNorman” and “Coraline.” The aesthetic of this movie is equally uncanny, with animated bodies slightly disproportionate, hats just a bit too tall, and houses that defy the physics we know to operate in this world. The majority of the street scenes are shot low to the ground, at the eye-level of children and trolls. It’s possible to get overwhelmed by legs and protruding bellies, but the perspective feels true to the title characters who live underneath the teetering city of Cheesebridge. The creatures that populate the movie, the boxtrolls, are adorable and eerie: they have tough blue skin, blunt and square heads and teeth, and grimy bodies covered by cardboard boxes. They run around with unnerving grunts and shuffles, hiding inside their own boxes whenever humans pass by.
The saddest part of all of this is that Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), the protagonist and confused human boy, doesn’t quite fit in with the silly, spooky boxtrolls. Just as the houses jut unevenly out of the precarious streets and clothing bulges uncomfortably on uneven bodies, Eggs finds himself out of place among the trolls. His arms, legs, and head stick out of his cardboard box, he cannot make the same sounds as the boxtrolls, and he does not get captured by the dreaded Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley), a terrifying cross-dresser.
Snatcher, the villain of the story, wants to exterminate all of the boxtrolls in Cheesebridge in exchange for prestige in the town. He goes to extraordinary lengths to persecute the harmless trolls, disguising himself as a traveling female performer to popularize the myth that boxtrolls steal and eat children through song and dance. He hires three henchmen, two of whom spend the whole movie debating their existential roles as the good guys or the bad guys as they scoop up boxtrolls in their nets and put them to work in a factory. In fact, many of the characters struggle with self-definition just like the farcical henchmen. Winnie (Elle Fanning) rebels against her elite, cheese-eating father to help her friend Eggs. The ruling elite of Cheesebridge hide behind tall white hats and eat cheese in gross quantities, and Archibald Snatcher struggles to be accepted by this caricature of aristocracy. Perhaps most gruesomely, Snatcher forces himself to eat cheese though he is dangerously allergic, his body ballooning in inconvenient places whenever a piece of cheese touches his tongue.
It seems that every character could learn a lesson from brave Eggs, who manages to “disguise” himself as a human and walk the line between both groups. He is able to convince the shy boxtrolls to shed their cardboard shells and save themselves, making what the crazy man hanging from the ceiling calls a “self-imposed metamorphosis.” Eggs is able to change his nature, and his act of defiance changes the prejudices of the town and an evil man out for power. “The Boxtrolls” is more than a creatively-animated movie with silly cheese puns: it’s a story about the danger of group mentality, corruption of the elite, persecution, and self-acceptance.

In the past six years, the nature/climate change documentary has become a well-established and fairly predictable genre. Icebergs melt, polar bears swim, and white-coated scientists explain that human beings have destroyed the earth. Such movies are usually both moving and scientifically accurate, but according to filmmaker Sylvie Rokab, there’s more to the story. “It’s extremely important to show us what’s going wrong,” she says. “But I felt that there needed to be a film that was more about the depth of how interconnected we are with everything around us.”
“Love Thy Nature,” her documentary premiering in Boston on Sept. 28, focuses on the profound link between humans and nature and frames climate change as the result of a disconnect between the two. “Only a reconnection, or finding that balance with nature, is going to bring us back to being sustainable as a species,” says Rokab. The film investigates and celebrates the different ways that humans commune with their environments—swimming, gardening, playing with animals—while tracing out the history of the bond’s disruption; Rokab sees the disconnect as originating in the agrarian revolution, expanding in the industrial revolution, and reaching critical mass in the digital age. Still, she insists that it is counterproductive to condemn technology along with past and future instances of progress. “I really felt there’s an important element of ‘let’s not fight over this.’ It really might have been necessary to our species to go this route,” she says. “It’s about discovering ways we can find balance and have it all, really.” And, of course, technology will likely play a critical role in returning humans to a sustainable lifestyle and the planet to a state of health.
The trailer portrays the movie as a typical climate change documentary, filled with gorgeous, sweeping, nature shots. However, the movie’s format departs significantly from tradition. According to Rokab, Liam Neeson, the narrator, plays ‘Sapiens,’ a character representative of the entirety of humanity. “He starts out in the film as very cynical, a bit unconscious,” she explains. “But he gets inspired, he figures things out intellectually…I thought it would be great to have a character transformation, a character journey.” Ultimately, whether or not “Love Thy Nature” manages to successfully execute its ideas, it seems likely to be an original and refreshing piece of work.

The New York of 1999, which provides the setting for Scott Frank’s “A Walk Among the Tombstones,” seems pre-historic all of a sudden. Giuliani has already cleaned up the city, many people have cell phones, and the general style, from slang to shirts, is similar to the present—it’s easy to feel almost sheepish for thinking things have changed in substantive ways over the last 15 years. Almost all of it boils down to the rise of tech—the miscommunications on pay phones, microfilm searches in libraries, and even spontaneous conversations on the street that take up much of the film are so distant from a 2014 perspective. Director and writer Scott Frank portrays the increasing irrelevance of the late ’90s through constant references to Y2K, and conversations about the potential for emerging technologies to change detective work act as creation myths for the smartphone ubiquity of the present.
Frank’s highlights of impending cultural change is part of his larger portrait of a dark city populated by grim people—the film is a true neo-noir, full of sudden violence, dark alleyways, and stoicism in the face of potential death. Liam Neeson is the perfect protagonist for Frank’s world, which is based on a novel from Lawrence Block’s long-running crime series. Neeson, in some ways a relic of the ’90s himself, has perfected the gravel-voiced, aging, ruthless-yet-moral action hero over the last five years. In “A Walk Among the Tombstones,” a rare R-rated film (and, boy, is it R-rated) in his recent string of thrillers, the actor seems at his most dynamic and brutal. And unlike last spring’s “Non-Stop,” where Neeson is on his cellphone so often that director Jaume Collet-Serra superimposed his phone’s dashboard onto the screen, Neeson is entirely unencumbered and unattached. He’s a loner, a recovering alcoholic, and a private eye, and that’s about it. Neeson’s minimalist performance, in conjunction with Frank’s eerie setting, makes “A Walk Among the Tombstones” a memorable entry in the contemporary detective genre.
Neeson’s Matt Scudder is an ex-NYPD cop who quit the force after a harrowing firefight in 1991. This burst of violence opens the film—Neeson, already drinking heavily on an off-duty morning, turns to see three men rob and shoot the barkeep about 20 feet behind him. He totters up from his booth and proceeds to kill or severely maim all three of the robbers. The firefight, filled with gore and kinetic movement down the concrete stairs and alleys of NYC, both sets the tone for the hyper-realistic violence of the film and acts as a central set piece—flashbacks to the scene eventually relay further degrees of trauma than are initially clear.
Frank’s transference of the flashback as a framing device from Block’s novel adds necessary complexity to the otherwise straightforward story. In addition to Scudder’s 1991 nadir, Frank also reveals the central conflict of the story, the kidnapping of a heroin trafficker’s wife, through an elegant and horrifying flashback. The trafficker, Kenny (Dan Stevens), summons Scudder to help him find the kidnappers. Although already operating outside the law in his unlicensed detective business, Scudder initially declines to work for the drug lord. After he relays the nauseating psychosexual tactics that the kidnappers used before killing his wife anyway and packing her remains into heroin bags in the back of an abandoned car, Scudder relents.
Neeson’s decidedly pre-millennial (lots of phone books, visits to potential leads, and on-foot pursuits) detective work leads him to other murders of drug dealers’ wives and two villains (David Harbour and Eric Nelson) who are up there with Buffalo Bill from “The Silence of the Lambs” in terms of sheer depravity. Frank structures these discoveries with taut camera work—an especially shocking moment comes when a cemetery worker who knew the killers flings himself off a rooftop as soon as he tells Neeson their first names, all in one shot. For the most part, Frank keeps these scenes intricate yet minimal—the soundtrack is effective but not at all flamboyant. When he does choose to “go Scorsese” in terms of music and scale, however, it’s a welcome change—the killers’ stalking of a 14-year-old drug dealer’s daughter, which is set to “Atlantis” by Donovan, is one of the creepiest scenes in a movie full of chilling moments.
The film has few inherently likeable characters—it’s difficult not to root for Scudder and the drug dealers whose loved ones he tries to save, but there’s always the lingering feeling that all the characters have made their own beds. The exception is T.J. (Brian “Astro” Bradley), a homeless kid who Neeson hires as an assistant. Somehow, this subplot, which could easily be maudlin and even offensive, helps provide an entirely sympathetic character. “A Walk Among the Tombstones” doesn’t provide any genre innovations, but its grit, sophisticated storytelling, and ambiance of the past are exhilarating.

When “Witness Uganda” premiered last February at the American Repertory Theater (ART), it inspired passionate conversation—and even brought one audience member to tears. “I found myself laughing, and I found myself yearning, and I found myself crying. I saw it six times,” says Timothy P. McCarthy, a lecturer on history and literature and adjunct lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School. “I just loved it. I think it was a beautifully and powerfully crafted work of art.”
It was after experiencing “Witness Uganda” that McCarthy was inspired to begin a series of discussions about human rights. In collaboration with the ART and the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, The ART of Human Rights explores an array of human rights issues—ranging from AIDS to African American civil rights to feminism—through conversations with leading artists in the field of human rights. The discussion series offers a way of looking at the role of theater activism and the continued relevance of the arts and humanities, and also presents the issues at hand in a new light.
Most human rights activists seek change through conventional means, but McCarthy believes that this can be limiting. “Often when you work with an established institution, whether it’s legal or political, it can be very frustrating because those institutions are not always set up to do the work of social justice,” he says. McCarthy sees art as a possible solution to the constraints of rigid institutions. “Art, unlike politics and policy, opens up a space for people to be inspired, for people to feel connected to one another,” he says. “It opens up a broader space, a more creative space, a more emotional space, a more democratic space.”
While McCarthy hopes the discussion series will expand the reach of human rights activism, the ART hopes the series will also highlight new possibilities for theater. “Theater can expand beyond the two-hour performance you see on the stage,” says Ryan McKittrick, director of artistic programs at the ART. “It’s what you carry out into the lobby, the discussions about what you saw. Even if the discussions happen months later.”
“Theater helps get people on same page, on an elemental level,” says Brendan Shea, a playwright who runs a partner program with The ART of Human Rights called Proclamation. Shea believes that art has the power to create “microcommunities,” unique groups of people who share a commonality. Under Shea’s guidance, 11 students from various Boston-area high schools collaborate on original plays about civil rights, with an emphasis on radicalism in American history. Using the improvisational exercises created by Shea as a launching point, the students use theater to express their shared passion for human rights. “Yesterday, they had to create a scene that contained different ingredients like silence or unison movement,” Shea says. “They had to express with their bodies what conformity meant to them.” For one group, conformity meant complying with the norms of marriage, and the group experimented with gay marriage. For another group, conformity meant labor rights and equal pay. “Certain theatrical elements help us connect emotionally in a way that just words or passionate conversation can’t quite do,” Shea says.
Ultimately, the series makes a case for the importance of the arts and humanities for the world at large. “Arts and the humanities are only on the wane when we turn away from them. They’re only on the wane when we make decisions to not fund them. They’re only on the wane when undergraduates decide they want to major in economics or something that is more practical because they’d like to get a job in a difficult economy,” McCarthy says.“I don’t want to live in a world where the arts and humanities die because we then die as a result of that. The denial of human rights is, at the end of the day, inspired in part by the inability to get along with each other, the inability to understand each other’s complexity and the inability to understand each other’s humanity. One of the things that help us understand and appreciate our humanity and recognize and respect it are the arts and humanities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The new fiscal year will start on Oct. 1, but Congress is unlikely to pass a new budget, instead relying on continuing resolutions to fund the government. But the new fiscal year represents more than an impending deadline: In the upcoming days and weeks as Congress debates the budget, the fates of one million people who are HIV positive hangs in the balance.
The U.S. contributes to the fight against global HIV through two main funding mechanisms: the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. While PEPFAR is a bilateral program in which the U.S. partners directly with recipient countries, the Global Fund is a multilateral mechanism that relies on contributions from multiple donor countries. The U.S. contribution to the Global Fund has been limited this year because pledges from other donor countries fell $300 million short of the U.S. pledge in President Obama’s 2015 budget. By law, the U.S. is only able to contribute one-third of the money in the Global Fund, and as the largest contributor, the U.S. pledge is largely determined by what the other donor countries contribute.
As the successes of science and medicine point ambitiously towards the end of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, American political will is faltering at this crucial juncture. In July, the Senate voted to cut $300 million from the global AIDS budget—a massive blow that comes on top of an aggregate cut to PEPFAR of $600 million since 2011. With an estimated average cost of $200 per patient for antiretroviral therapy, a loss of $300 million to fighting AIDS globally would result in more than 1 million people without lifesaving treatment.
The House of Representatives previously passed a version of the budget that allocated the unmatched $300 million from the Global Fund to PEPFAR; however, in July, the Senate passed a budget that completely scrapped the $300 million from the global AIDS budget. While science clearly shows that the possibility of achieving an “AIDS-Free Generation” is real, the political will to take steps toward it seems to have withered in America.
It is imperative that Congress revive the fight against the AIDS pandemic by putting unmatched funds from the Global Fund toward PEPFAR to prevent a further $300 million cut. Specifically, we call on Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey to take leadership in these budget negotiations and to ensure that this cut does not become reality.
The immediate task could not be simpler: Keep steady U.S. funding for fighting global HIV/AIDS by allocating the $300 million that will be lost from the Global Fund to PEPFAR.
PEPFAR is one of the most effective programs run by the U.S. government. Prior to the creation of PEPFAR under President Bush in 2003, only 50,000 people infected with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa were receiving treatment. The program currently provides lifesaving antiretroviral therapy to 6.7 million people worldwide Research proves that people on antiretroviral therapy are significantly less likely to transmit the virus to someone else Treatment is prevention.
PEPFAR also supports HIV testing and counseling for more than 12.8 million pregnant women, and it provided care and support to over 12 million people. UNAIDS (the United Nations AIDS Program) has recently declared that with strong support, it is possible to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.
As the budget process proceeds, it looks more likely that Congress will continue the trend of passing a continuing resolution in lieu of a new budget. In this situation, no funding has to be lost as long as legislators add a provision to ensure that unmatched Global Fund money is moved to PEPFAR instead of scrapped altogether. It would be a tragedy for life saving funds to be lost because of an oversight or simple lack of will.
Losing these funds entirely would be a death sentence for some of the world’s most vulnerable populations, and a major setback in realizing an AIDS-free generation. Scientific advancements beg resolute political leadership—now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the White House released a new nationwide initiative “It’s on Us” to combat the scourge of sexual assault on college campuses by emphasizing the role that every student, especially bystanders, must play in preventing sexual assault.
“The fact is that from sports leagues to pop culture to politics, our society still does not sufficiently value women. We still don’t condemn sexual assault as loudly as we should,” President Barack Obama said in his speech at the initiative’s launch last Friday. “This is on all of us, every one of us, to fight campus sexual assault.”
Placing the onus on bystander intervention is exactly the right focus for preventing sexual violence and changing a culture that is altogether too passive, if not permissive, of sexual assault. The initiative’s website, ItsOnUs.org, states its goal “to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors and supported,” and features pledges for students to sign alongside a star-studded video.
Ever since the issue of sexual assault on college campus captured national attention after several harrowing accounts of college’s inadequate treatment of survivors, the White House has taken strong action in countering an epidemic that affects one in five women during their college years.
In April, a White House task force on sexual assault released its commendable first report, which recommended engaging men on campuses and the development of clearer disciplinary systems and sexual misconduct policies. In May, the Department of Education released a list of 55 colleges and universities with open sexual violence investigations by the department’s Office of Civil Rights for possible violation of Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination for institutions receiving federal funding. Both Harvard College and Harvard Law School were on the list.
While there are a number of institutional changes, such as codification of an affirmative consent policy, that colleges and universities can take to make sexual assault response more clear and supportive of survivors, the national culture around sexual violence is less easy to change immediately—even though it is just as important. By emphasizing that every person is a potential bystander, that every person must remain vigilant, that culture of passivity can slowly begin to change.
And while it speaks well of the White House to be so responsive to the issue of sexual assault on campuses, there are many other communities damaged by sexual violence, including the homeless, American Indians, and trans people.
The problem of sexual assault on campuses is one close to home—but until all Americans are free to live without the debilitating scars of sexual violence, everyone must do their part. It’s on us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 26, 2014, at 11:32 a.m.
This past summer, Harvard announced that it would remove difficulty scores from the Q-Guide. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris said that “these changes reflect the decisions of the Faculty Council that were intended to make the Q a more accurate, sophisticated, and helpful mechanism for learning about and choosing courses.” Much of students' outrage centers upon the idea that we have the right to know this information and to choose classes as we please. I have a question for Jay Harris and the students of Harvard though that might alter the discussion on removing difficulty from the Q: How do we, as Harvard students and faculty members, define difficulty?
This question may seem overly simplistic, but in my mind, it is actually quite nuanced. When the Q asks us whether or not a class is difficult, is it asking us how hard it is to get an A? Or how easy it is to get a B? Is it how difficult the day-to-day work is, or how hard the final assignments are? I am sure that when many students answer on the Q, they have one or all of these definitions in mind. Difficulty could mean something more thought provoking though. It could be how much a class forces us to think about our own values and preconceived ideas and either change them or inspire us to believe them more deeply. Similarly, it could be how challenging the test material is, instead of how harshly the professor grades those tests. Or, maybe, something being difficult means that it forces us think about the big questions of life that frequently make us uncomfortable.
To be honest, I have no answers to this conundrum. I do know though that I am disappointed in our faculty for not challenging us to consider these questions about difficulty. Instead of using the Q-guide and our courses as a chance to ask ourselves what each of us considers as difficult and to show others these definitions, they have affirmed our belief that difficulty is synonymous with grades. They perpetuate a culture where we avoid uncomfortable questions and an intellectual challenge just as much as students who choose every class based on the difficulty scores do. Similarly, the faculty frequently laments how inflated grades have become. Again though, they are just as guilty of partaking in this inflation as the students are. Instead of making the content of their class difficult to think about, they focus on how hard it is to succeed in their class. I challenge the faculty to turn their focus away from grades and Q-scores. Specifically, I ask professors to consider these two questions: Who cares if it is easy to get an A if a student has been challenged to contemplate their ideas of the world and the content and has become a better learner in the process? And what is the point of giving a B for the sake of making a class “hard”?
Just as much as I ask the faculty to consider my thoughts, I ask my fellow students to do the same. We have a constant focus on how hard or easy it is to get a good grade in a class. I understand it. We have all been taught to strive for excellence in our efforts to get into Harvard, and an A is the ultimate sign of academic excellence. In our quest for this narrow definition of excellence though, we have forgotten that overcoming a challenge is imperative to excelling at something. As Henry Ward Beecher, an American abolitionist, once said, “We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.” I encourage every member of the Harvard community, from tenured faculty to new freshmen, to consider this idea.
Similarly, in our quest to be the best, I find that we frequently lose sight of the amazing, meaningful talents we already do possess. In my work at the Admissions Office, the admissions officers frequently talk about how they seek out the “most intelligent, the most talented, and the most humane” students possible. We are those students, and in that spirit, I think it is important to remember and remind each other that we are excellent because of the ways that we better the lives of those around us. We do so via our prodigious athletic skills, our commitment to service, our ability to be engaging conversationalists, and our courage to disagree with our professors and peers. Most importantly, we are excellent people when we make our friends laugh and smile on their worst days. Our excellence is not defined by the letters, or the school, on our transcripts but by all of the other unbelievable things that we do for those around us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Silk dress, dove gray, fifty years old and sixty dollars. Little vintage store in Boston. Think transatlantic Sylvia Plath around the time she bit Ted Hughes’ cheek. Think sexier “His Girl Friday.” I fucking loved that dress. Pepper-hot hole burning in my freshman-year checking account from writing money—I had to have it. I nabbed it, brought it home, and wore it to the literary magazine open house, covering my torso with silk and my nervousness with lipstick.
I came to Harvard because it felt hostile. And it felt hostile, mostly, because of how it looked: stained glass windows, heavy spires, thick oriental rugs. I was eighteen years old and bursting the seams of my small town, having outgrown its ugly linoleum-halled high school and muddy, Confederate-flag-strewn pickup trucks. Harvard seemed big. Harvard seemed evil. When I walked through the Yard one October morning, a girl in red lipstick, black skinny jeans, and black heels power-walked out of Weld looking sexual and important. On a Wednesday. Harvard was mean because Harvard was aesthetic, and I, said the admissions committee in a fortuitous letter in late April, was Harvard.
But I wasn’t, or, at least, I didn’t feel like I was. I feel like a lot of us never really do. We can all name articles of clothing, architecture, and décor that form the “Harvard aesthetic”: pastel shorts, Memorial Church’s bell tower, Sperries. As a freshman, these things terrified me; they still frequently terrify me. The Lampoon steps, the Barker Center carpets, the Law School leather couches, the Annenberg rafters and the plush interior of the Spee—the objects of daily life—were constant reminders that I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. Harvard aesthetics are about a sense of continuity: that awe you feel when you walk into Sanders; the feeling that JFK and Thoreau are just around the corner, at an ornate defunct fireside, having a chat. But we’re not all Teddy Roosevelt, and the aesthetics of continuity are also continuous with an exclusionary past. For those of us who feel structurally alienated in whatever way from this past, or for whom the Harvard aesthetic isn’t contiguous with our personal pasts, aesthetics can have an intimidating, exclusionary bite. And more than that: The aesthetics of a place circumscribe its occupants, enabling certain forms of being, certain modes of thinking, and excluding others. How can we be productive, then—not to mention happy—when surrounded by social and aesthetic modes that in some way reify our exclusion? How can we think exciting, gutsy, radical, rebellious thoughts when constantly elbowed by the big guys of the past?
An example of how complex this is: The fall of my freshman year, I was part of a discussion group dedicated to analyzing these very issues. We met once a week to talk about identity and power, about social stratification and social space. Of all places, we did it in the Coolidge room. The Coolidge room is in Adams House, and it looks like an Abercrombie showroom: walls festooned in a mural of the muscular collegiate gentlemen of Harvard past. None of us looked like anyone pictured in the murals; sitting there felt like wearing someone else’s outgrown suit. How did our surroundings suggest the ways we could or could not be, the things we could or could not say?
There is incredible vitality in the promise of diversity. We are, as collections of individuals, more original and thrilling, more productive and messier, than the tradition in which we are placed. And there are ways to facilitate this creativity. First of all, we can fight for spatial affirmations of human diversity against histories of exclusion: this is why spaces like the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the Women’s Center, and the Office for BGLTQ Student Life are so important. Second of all, we can fill spaces with possibility models. The Harvard Foundation Portraiture Project, for example, does just this. In commissioning paintings of people of color who’ve had substantive roles in Harvard’s history and hanging them in campus space, the Project subtly changes the archive of each building’s interior.  It’s powerful to see someone who looks like you, or to have space specifically welcoming to people who identify as you do, on this campus.
As a senior—even as one who’s done her fair share of walking through the Yard in heels—I think a lot about me at nineteen, at that open house, terrified in that scrap of silk. We live in a community deeply and ostentatiously circumscribed by Tradition, capital T: It’s built into the walls and hangs adorning them; it structures our course loads and social lives. I want to think critically about the materiality of that tradition, and how we can intervene to make this an enabling, justice-oriented space. How do the confines of these rooms shape the confines of our imaginations? How do we open up the library windows, fling open the gates, tempt a crossbreeze as wide and wild as ourselves?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each Tuesday, a group of 30 College administrators convene in Lamont Library. Seated in the third floor conference room, they weigh in on everything from routine requests from students—permission to study abroad or activate advanced standing—to the most serious allegations of academic misconduct.
The Administrative Board, as the group of deans and faculty members is known, has remained mostly unchanged since its founding in 1890. But two major policy changes, approved in the span of just two months earlier this year, are set to overhaul its jurisdiction and rework its purpose by next fall.
Three years ago, for instance, the College’s top judicial body heard 271 disciplinary cases. Eighty-three of those—almost a third—were related to academic dishonesty, while three were cases of alleged sexual misconduct, according to statistics on the Board’s website.
Come next fall, though, after the College’s first honor code goes into effect, the Board will no longer hear the vast majority of such cheating cases, if any. Sexual assault allegations have already been removed from the body’s investigatory purview with this academic year’s implementation of Harvard’s first-ever University-wide sexual harassment policy.
The Ad Board’s function is changing fundamentally. This time next year, the body that previously governed all the major facets of student life will no longer have the same control over the College’s handling of two issues that have most recently dominated campus discourse.
“They’ll probably spend less time together on Tuesday afternoons,” said Donald H. Pfister, former interim dean of the College and Ad Board chair.
LIGHTENING THE LOAD
Recent scrutiny into the Ad Board’s handling of cheating and sexual assault cases would have you believe that all its work is disciplinary. Amid 2012’s Government 1310 cheating scandal, critics called the Board opaque and unfair. And as the federal government opened an investigation into the College’s adherence to anti-sex discrimination law Title IX last spring, it came under fire once more.
Much of what the Board does day-to-day, however, is less controversial. It hears academic review cases, which involve students who have earned unsatisfactory grades or have otherwise failed to meet academic requirements. In 2011-2012, the Ad Board heard 385 such cases.
The Ad Board also processes petitions for exceptions to academic policies, like those governing simultaneous enrollment. Those petitions take less time to resolve, but the Board hears many of them—1,595 in 2011-2012.
The most recent publicly available statistics on the Ad Board’s caseload are from 2012-2013, but those numbers are not representative because that year saw the adjudication of the College’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory.
That cheating scandal accelerated the Academic Integrity Committee’s efforts to propose the College’s first honor code, which will establish a distinct student-faculty judicial body to adjudicate academic integrity cases starting next fall. The several members of the Ad Board who sit on the Academic Integrity Committee, including Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, had a hand in shaping the policy that will siphon off the Board’s role in academic dishonesty cases.
Around the same time, a working group that included former Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote and released a new policy governing Harvard’s handling of sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault. That policy and its accompanying procedures created the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, a central body that now investigates sexual harassment complaints from any student across the University, removing sexual misconduct investigations from the Ad Board’s caseload.
With these changes, the Ad Board will continue to hear some discipline cases—most “social” discipline cases, like those involving drugs and alcohol—and it will still hand down sanctions in sexual assault cases, though the ODR will investigate them first. And it will no longer hear most, if any, cheating cases, which in 2011-2012 accounted for 26 of the 35 disciplinary cases that required students to withdraw temporarily from the College.
The Ad Board may hear some cheating cases if they do not fall clearly within the upcoming student-faculty honor council’s jurisdiction.
Discipline cases take up the majority of the Board’s time, according to Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard and a member of the body. When the Ad Board investigated sexual assault cases, they took up a small proportion of its caseload, but they were especially time consuming, said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
With neither academic nor sexual assault investigations within the Ad Board’s jurisdiction, its focus will inevitably shift, something current and past members acknowledge.
“The Ad Board itself may spend more of its time on the review of requests for exceptions to rules and more on some of the social discipline, things like tampering with fire safety equipment,” said Dingman, who sits on the Board.
“It’s a huge, huge change,” added Richard M. Losick, a biology professor who previously sat on the Ad Board as a faculty member and has advised students who went before it.
Like other administrators, Interim Secretary of the Ad Board Brett Flehinger characterized the upcoming changes to the Board positively. He suggested that the shift in jurisdiction will allow it to focus more on its educational mission. The lightened caseload will help the Board “focus our energy and do our jobs better,” he said.
IMAGE MAKEOVER
Despite its supposed educational mission, the Ad Board has long been dogged by an image problem. Critics question its transparency, and students associate it not with study cards, but with plagiarism investigations and required leaves from school.
The Ad Board’s reputation as a cheating board will be up in the air as the upcoming honor council takes on the task of hearing academic discipline cases. To some administrators, this shift is a chance for the Ad Board to rebrand itself.
Dingman said he hopes the changes will spur a shift in how students perceive the Board. “I think there’s a good likelihood there will be” a change, he added.
Losick imagines that as current students graduate from the College, they will take with them the perception of the “old” Ad Board, while future students will see something different.
“In a few years, the student body will change, and they won’t have the memory of an earlier era,” Losick said.
Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said it’s difficult to predict the Ad Board’s future while much remains to be seen. Details about the honor council, which will hear cheating cases next year, are still being finalized; it is likely that the Ad Board and honor council’s memberships will overlap. But Lake added that the future Board could differ dramatically.
“The future of the Ad Board could be so different that it won’t make the front page of The Crimson anymore,” Lake said.

After 18 months of construction originally projected to cost $12 million, the now-LEED gold-certified Tozzer Library, the country’s oldest anthropology collection, reopened in mid-June. The project renovated the nearly 40-year-old library and centralized the offices of the faculty of the anthropology department, who were previously spread across campus.
Renovation of Tozzer Library, which sits on Divinity Avenue adjoined to the Peabody Museum, began in January 2013 and came as part of a larger $20 million project to unite sub-disciplines within the Anthropology Department. During construction, the collection was moved to the first floor of nearby William James Hall.
Now, social anthropology faculty members—who previously had their offices in William James—have offices on the top two floors of Tozzer, just a short walk from the Peabody Museum offices of their counterparts in the archaeology division.
On the floors below these new offices, which surround a skylit atrium, sits the renovated library, which has more room for studying and less space for the collection than the old library. Tozzer now holds only 80,000 pieces of its 250,000-piece collection, said the library’s associate librarian for collections, Janet Steins. The rest has been moved off site to the Harvard Depository to make room for group study areas.
“I think it’s a better allocation of space,” Steins said, who added that she has seen use of the library increase compared to before it closed in 2013.
Tozzer was stripped down to its structural steel and then rebuilt to meet the LEED gold standards for sustainable heating and cooling. The original 24,800 square foot space was expanded by 10,000 square feet and redesigned to match the brick and copper style of the neighboring Peabody Museum. An additional entrance was added to the rear courtyard.
Inside, the library features new furnitur, replacing the chairs and desks bought for the original Tozzer Library, built in 1974. The stacks and reading room are now more friendly to modern technologies, which the original structure predated.
Former dean of the social sciences Stephen M. Kosslyn and current dean Peter V. Marsden spearheaded the initiative to renovate Tozzer, one of the largest anthropology research libraries in the world, in an effort to consolidate the department’s archeology program with the social anthropology division. The move to bring together sub-disciplines came in 2009 after human evolutionary biology, formerly known as biological anthropology, became its own department.
Tozzer was originally founded in 1866 as the Peabody Museum Library.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 26, 2014, at 2:52 a.m.
Coursera co-Founder Andrew Y. Ng spoke at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Thursday afternoon about “deep learning," a new set of algorithms that he said have the potential to dramatically enhance artificial intelligence technologies.
Deep learning, a subfield of computer science, is currently being developed by computer scientists to handle massive amounts of information and data, which can be applied to speech and image recognition.
Ng, who is also the chief scientist at the Chinese search engine Baidu and an associate professor of computer science at Stanford University, said that the main goal of his presentation was to “share with [the audience] some strategic views about deep learning and give [them] some general ideas about whether to work on deep learning in the future.”
Ng used a “coffee mug” analogy throughout the presentation to illustrate his ideas. He explained that, with a traditional method, scientists have to teach a computer to recognize a coffee mug by exposing it to thousands of coffee mugs, creating a database of information Ng called “labeled data." But deep learning allows computers to recognize data on their own.
According to Ng, a traditional data mining method that requires labeled data is now impractical given the vast amount of information that computers process today. He added that deep learning allows computers to act like infants and animals, who learn on their own how to recognize objects.
Accordingly, Ng said, deep learning could have significant implications on speech and image recognition.
The talk attracted both experts and newcomers to deep learning, according to audience members interviewed after the event.  Two visiting scholars said that they knew nothing about the field before hearing Ng speak, but others said they had a previous interest in the field.
“I want to work in deep learning in the future, and I knew most of the material before I came here, so I did not get a lot out of it. I am here to talk to Ng,” said Borui Wang ’15, a computer science concentrator.
Kanya “Pao” Siangliulue, a fourth year graduate student at SEAS and one of the few female students at the event, said she was inspired by the presentation.
“I studied human-computer interaction, and I did not know very much about deep learning. But Ng’s lecture was very interesting and I wish to learn more about this field,” Siangliulie said.

In an increasingly crowded marketplace for massive open online courses, HarvardX faculty and administrators are applying a variety of marketing strategies to spread the word about the courses they offer.
When HarvardX launched in 2012, the program offered only two courses, both of which were hosted by edX, a non-profit joint project between Harvard and MIT to provide a centralized space for MOOCs. The launch, which closely followed the creation of for-profit platforms like Coursera, was met with fanfare and a near unanimous hype among news media. The New York Times dubbed 2012 “The Year of the MOOC,” and millions of users signed up for online courses within months.
But two years out and with dozens of new courses created, HarvardX is facing the challenge of attracting users, sustaining its program financially, and fostering engagement among online students as more for-profit competitors enter the market.
Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX, said that because the hype for the program has died down since its inception, he and fellow administrators have developed targeted and, in some cases, grassroots marketing strategies to promote HarvardX courses.
According to Lue, HarvardX encourages faculty members who participated in creating online content to promote their courses by using word of mouth, leveraging personal connections, and posting to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
David D. Cox ’00, assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology and director of MCB80X: “Fundamentals of Neuroscience,” said that because edX now offers so many courses, it is becoming harder for individual classes to attract attention. As a result, he has turned to targeting specific neuroscience audiences through social media to market his course.
“It matters not how many eyeballs you get, but how engaged are those particular eyeballs,” Cox said. “How much do [students] care about the message that you’re sending.”
Elisa New, a professor of American literature who taught and helped develop two poetry courses for HarvardX, created a video of the Harvard men’s basketball team reading a poem about basketball to market her courses. The video was sent to SB Nation, a sports blog with millions of visitors each month.
“HarvardX and its public affairs people are often looking for creative and interesting ways to let the world know what we are doing,” New said.
According to Lue, though HarvardX does not view other online platforms as competition, the staff still monitor the content their counterparts are creating.
“You have to make a decision,” Lue said. “Do you have a perspective, do you have an angle that’s better or different and worthwhile in comparison to the others?”
Despite the competition, Lue said that HarvardX has always been able to rely on one thing to attract audiences around the world: the Harvard brand.
“The brand always cuts a swath in the field,” Lue said. “Faculty are very committed to us having really effective outreach, because it is their voice. It is their perspective—it is their take on something they feel is very important, so there is a lot of ‘sharing with the world’ notions driving this, so making sure that we can maximize that is important.”

Faced with increasing numbers of instructors and concentrators, administrators and faculty members at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences say they are concerned about space availability in the years before portions of the school are slated to move to Allston in 2018. These space constraints, some say, may adversely impact hiring and research potential at SEAS.
According to SEAS Executive Dean for Administration Tim Bowman, the school has already converted underutilized classrooms into teaching laboratories and other spaces. While SEAS was able to meet most of its members’ needs for space thus far, there is now no additional space available, he said.
“For five years it will be a scramble,” Bowman said, adding that SEAS does not yet have formal plans for accommodating the increasing number of students and faculty members between now and the projected move to the Allston campus. Undergraduate enrollment in SEAS courses has increased by 137 percent since 2009, according to data provided by the school’s Assistant Dean of Communications Paul Karoff last spring.
To make room for other courses that are held in the same space, the school's students currently have to wrap up and store their experiments at the end of each laboratory session, said SEAS Executive Dean for Education and Research Fawwaz Habbal, who also lectures in applied physics.
“Everything is on wheels,” Habbal said, adding that being forced to store unfinished projects can be disruptive and harmful to the learning experience. “We try very hard to make it non-visible to the students.”
Besides teaching and learning, space limitations have also taken a toll on research endeavors and faculty hiring at SEAS.
“We’re out of space, and the faculty is still growing,” said Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis '68, adding that space constraints influence the kind of faculty members that SEAS can hire.
In an interview last spring, SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said that the school is currently hiring mostly theorists rather than experimentalists as the SEAS community waits for more space to open up in Allston.
That mandate has hit some areas harder than others, Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur said.
“Applied physicists all tend to be experimentalists,” he said. “They need to have a lab, and the lab needs to be put somewhere, but right now there is simply no space left.”
And with the Allston move just a few years away, SEAS cannot invest multiple millions of dollars in building new research laboratories in Cambridge, Bowman said.
“It’s not a good use of Harvard’s resources,” he said.
Habbal added that a number of SEAS faculty are currently sharing their laboratories, adding that the lack of space also shapes the kinds of research projects that can be conducted at the school.
“The next five years will be challenging,” Bowman said. “The good news is that everybody understands, and everybody is working together to make it work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who are the first to go to college in their families shared their experiences with fellow students and administrators in a community conversation Thursday, exchanging ideas on how the College can better help “first-gen” students navigate challenges they might face at Harvard.
The event was organized by the First Generation Student Union, a student organization that Harvard officially recognized last November. According to the group’s president Jasmine A. Fernandez ’16, the club’s missions include creating a supportive community for first-generation students, fostering a “first-gen” identity, and advocating for more institutional support.
Administrators, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, and Elm Yard Dean Jasmine M. Waddell, also participated in the discussion.
Waddell opened the discussion by saying that she knows of at least 36 different initiatives happening around the University that aim to support first-generation students, but there needs to be more communication and coordination between groups.
Undergraduates talked about the unique challenges and frustrations they have faced as first-generation students at an elite institution, especially the hefty monetary costs incurred by certain experiences or activities. Though the event was open to the College, The Crimson granted anonymity to several of the attendees, who requested that their names not be used given the sensitive nature of the topic.
“I have not been to networking events because I don’t have the clothes, and I don’t have the money to buy them,” said one junior, adding that other colleges have funds that enable students to afford business formal clothing.
“There are some classes that I can’t take because of the cost of the coursepacks…. It’s ironic that I took a class on the inequity in education whose coursepack cost more than $100,” said one sophomore.
A senior pointed out that, according to some studies, lower-income students are less comfortable speaking with adults in general, which can pose a challenge when they try to reach out to professors and staff members for support.
Students also mentioned times when they were confused or frustrated by Harvard’s financial aid system.
“We are expected to work over the summer, which limits what I can do in the summer… I don’t have the same opportunities as my peers who can study abroad or do an internship,” said a second junior.
A third junior said that parents who do not speak English can be confused by the communications sent out by the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, and that more bilingual resources should be available for families.
After listening to students’ concerns, Khurana said that the difficulties presented get in the way of achieving the mission of the College, where he believes every student should have the conditions to flourish.
“There is a lot of taken-for-grantedness that exists in this institution in terms of backgrounds, resources and capacities,” Khurana said. “We need to be aware that unexamined assumptions can be experienced differently by different people with different backgrounds.”
Dingman emphasized that a lot things can be done by the various departments to better support first-generation students and that coordination is crucial.
“I feel very confident that we can make it work,” Dingman said.

A free virtual classroom may be just as conducive to learning as a traditional university setting, according to a study of a massive open online course offered by edX.
The report, entitled “Learning in an Introductory Physics MOOC: All Cohorts Learn Equally, Including an On-Campus Class,” found that the “learning gain” of a group of MOOC students was comparable to that achieved by students enrolled in the same course at MIT.
The study also discovered that MOOC students with a variety of academic backgrounds demonstrated roughly the same level of relative improvement over the duration of the course. According to the researchers, these findings reflect positively on the potential of MOOCs to distribute knowledge without a teacher being physically present.
“I want to use MOOCs as an online laboratory to develop a new educational pedagogy,” said David Pritchard, a physics professor at MIT and the principal investigator of the study. “A MOOC is a rising tide that lifts all students.”
Pritchard likens MOOCs to particle accelerators, as both allow for large-scale and instantaneous data collection.
Of the 17,000 people who signed up for the course, “Mechanics ReView,” through edX, about 1,000 earned certificates of completion. Learning gains were assessed by comparing the results of tests administered to the students before and after the course, a methodology that researchers said had never before been applied to a MOOC.
According to study co-author John Champaign, the highly automated nature of MOOCs allows user interface parameters to be closely monitored. Based on the resulting data, the three researchers have also recently published a study where they found a negative correlation between time spent reading material or doing homework and test scores. They attributed this finding to teachers and other professionals taking the course to evaluate it. In the near future, they plan to develop a course specifically for high school physics students from which they hope to extract what Pritchard calls “cleaner data.”
Since the term was coined in 2008, MOOCs have become a formidable force in the education industry. EdX, an open courseware collaboration originally formed by MIT and Harvard, boasts hundreds of thousands of unique users annually. Many other websites offer similar quality content, including Coursera and Udacity, and have collectively enrolled millions of students.
“I think we’re just barely learning how to create these tools, and they have a lot of potential even if they’re not for everyone,” said Colin Fredericks, an author of the paper and a course developer for HarvardX.

New Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana is prioritizing facetime with undergraduates over courting potential Harvard donors.
In an interview Wednesday, his first sit-down with The Crimson since he assumed the deanship in July, Khurana said he has been spending at least three-fourths of his time meeting with students since they came to campus. Meanwhile, he said he intends to be only minimally involved with The Harvard Campaign, the University’s $6.5 billion fundraising drive.
“My goal is to be a present dean at the College,” Khurana said, adding that he thinks that being physically on campus is critical to his role as dean and co-master of Cabot House.
When asked what proportion of his time he expects to spend on the capital campaign, Khurana said he “would be surprised if it was in the single percentage digits. Not much higher than two, three percent.”
The College is slated to reap benefits in the form of undergraduate House renewal and financial aid, among other priorities, from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ $2.5 billion portion of the campaign.
Donald H. Pfister, former interim dean of the College and Khurana’s predecessor, similarly attended few fundraising events when he was in University Hall last year. But since the campaign’s public phase kicked off last fall, other administrators have devoted increasing amounts of their time to fundraising and travel. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and University President Drew G. Faust have said that they spend, half and up to half of their time on the effort, respectively.
Since students came to campus in August, Khurana has been highly visible, both in person and via social media. Throughout September, he gave several talks to students, meeting with the Undergraduate Council and making an appearance at a training session for student group leaders at the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Talking to freshmen, Khurana said, has been one of his top priorities. In addition to speaking at freshman orientation programs at the start of semester, he’s taken to eating breakfast with students in Annenberg, the freshman dining hall.
He has also mingled with faculty and administrators at other public events. Earlier this week, he joined other faculty members on a panel with controversial author William Deresiewicz and discussed the purpose of higher education. Khurana is scheduled to moderate a forum discussion on the American Dream in Sanders Theatre this Saturday.

Students who violate academic honesty standards in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” may no longer be referred to the Administrative Board for investigation, according to a newly formalized “regret clause” in the course’s syllabus.
Instead, students who commit what course staff consider “unreasonable” acts, such as sharing problem set answers, plagiarizing, or cheating on a quiz, can report the violation within 72 hours and will likely face only local course sanctions. Those sanctions are determined on a case-by-case basis and could include receiving a failing or unsatisfactory grade, according to the syllabus. It stipulates that a case resolved in local sanctions would not be referred to the Ad Board, though other cases may be.
This regret policy appears to be a deviation from long-standing Ad Board procedures, which since 2010 have allowed for “local sanctions” to be imposed by course staff only in conjunction with the Board and the chair of the department in question.
The policy is the second exception of standard Ad Board regulations made for CS50 this academic year. The other was allowing students in the course—the College’s highest enrolled offering in five years—to simultaneously enroll without meeting requirements mandated by the policy.
Course instructor David J. Malan ’99 pointed to the nature of the course, which often sees students making “poor decisions” “late at night” when submitting assignments, as a reason to introduce the policy. He said that if a student is proactive enough to approach the course staff about his or her breach in academic integrity, the course instructors should use the incident to inspire students to reflect on and discuss academic integrity.
“All that is new this year is the course's explicit encouragement of students to approach the course's heads proactively if, upon some sleep and reflection, they regret having taken some action that the course might consider not reasonable,” Malan, who said he was too busy to be interviewed, wrote in an email.
Malan did not answer questions, however, about the policy’s origins or whether the Ad Board is aware of it. Interim Secretary of the Ad Board Brett Flehinger declined to comment on the matter, as well. Several other members of the body either declined to comment or referred the matter to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who also did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
But in an unrelated interview in April, former Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison said that all cases of academic dishonesty must come before the Ad Board, saying that leaving disciplinary action under the sole authority of a course’s instructors would lead to inconsistency across the College.
"Faculty members are not allowed to take action against a student for an unproved case of academic integrity violation,” said Ellison. “It has to come to the Ad Board, 100 percent."
He added later in the interview: "The faculty members in the FAS are not allowed to—they don't have the discretion to do this themselves, at all, currently, and never have."
In practice, though, faculty members ultimately decide which incidents to report.
According to Malan, CS50 refers as many as five percent of enrolled students to the Administrative Board each fall. To his knowledge, the course refers more cases—20 last fall alone—of academic dishonesty than any other at the College. Malan said he is unsure if those numbers will change given the formal implementation of the “regret clause.”
“[Those numbers are] not because students in CS50 are any less honest than students in other courses but because CS50 looks for transgressions and because, as a CS course with electronic submissions, we have tools that facilitate detection,” Malan wrote

Documentary photographer Kevin Bubriski told the story of Nepal in photos Thursday, explaining how Nepalese culture has evolved since the 1970s and highlighting shots from his new photograph collection, currently on display in CGIS South.
At Thursday’s event, entitled “The Edges and Beyond: Shedding Light on Shangri La” and held in CGIS South, Bubriski discussed the exhibition of roughly 35 of his photos. Nepal is not the mythical Asian utopia Shangri La, Bubriski said, but rather a diverse country that sits at a cultural crossroads.
The collection displays images of the diverse inhabitants of Nepal, showing the people who populate Kathmandu and the northwest parts of the country.
“I was trying to get a variety of different ways of understanding and looking at Nepal,” Bubriski, a Massachusetts native, said in an interview. “I photographed Nepal for over 40 years, and I realized that I had never told the story of Nepal. This book is a long-term project, and through the generosity of the Peabody Museum, I was able to put a starting point and an endpoint to the story to craft a fixed statement with this book.”
One photo taken in the streets of Jumla in 1978 shows a crowd of people’s faces in awe of the passing King and Queen of Nepal, whom the Nepalese see as the embodiment of Hindu deity Vishnu, according to Bubriski’s caption.
Annemarie S. Mal, a first-year student at the Harvard Divinity School and one of dozens of attendees Thursday, commented on the impact she felt upon viewing the images.
“These images force us to reflect on our privilege,” she said. “It’s interesting how our first-world perspectives clash with the way many people around the world live, and how our interpretations of progress are directly affecting the way many people live, sometimes to the detriment to these people.”
Mal added that many of the issues presented in Bubriski’s images are analogous to the plight of indigenous populations in the southwestern United States.
Holly Angell, associate director of the Asia Center, praised the presentation. “I think this is one of our most popular and impressive exhibitions,” she said.
As he finished his presentation, Bubriski emphasized the many different facets of life in Nepal.
“Nepal is an incredibly diverse country, geographically, topographically, ethnically, socially, economically. You have the divide between the rural and urban, rich and poor, the caste system of hierarchy, ethnic groupings…. There’s incredible complexity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After scoring three goals in sixteen minutes to take out Northeastern on Tuesday, the Harvard men’s soccer team (4-3-0) is riding high. The Crimson has scored 10 goals in four games heading into its game against UMass (1-5-0) on Friday, looking to take out its third in-state rival in less than two weeks. The Back Page previews the matchup below.
Is This Offense Here to Stay?
After the team scored just two goals in its first three games, coach Pieter Lehrer presciently noted that “all the parts are there … we are not far off.” The team has rewarded his faith by scoring at least three goals in four straight games after having not accomplished the feat once since November 2011.
Before the year, both coach and players commented on the increased familiarity with the system. Through seven games, the Crimson have scored 15 goals—eight more than it had at this point last year. With increased versatility across the lineup—10 different players have already scored this year—the team’s offense looks to have staying power.
Playing With a Full Deck
Harvard’s last pair of wins have come without co-captain Kyle Henderson, who has sat the entirety of both games after providing two of the team’s first three goals in the season. Henderson is the team’s premier creator from the midfield position and can launch accurate shots from anywhere on the field. The senior sniper has eight shots on goal in five games.
Henderson is not the only one struggling with injuries—junior co-captain Mark Ashby received stitches for the third time this season following a split chin endured during the Northeastern game. This Crimson team is deep and has weathered the departure of Henderson thus far, but possible or extended absences from both players are crucial things to watch moving forward.
Player to Watch
Senior forward Philip Flesichman had two goals in 14 games last year but has yet to get on the board in 2014. He has shots in two of his last three games after recording none in his first four and will look to notch his first score of the year on Friday.

The Harvard football team’s road trip to Brown can go wrong for the Crimson in one of three foreseeable ways.
1. While in Providence, senior quarterback Conner Hempel falls in love with [indie band you haven’t heard of] before Saturday night’s game, shaves half his head, gets a nose ring, and vows to devote no more time to mainstream frivolities like playing football.
2. The lights go out early again at Brown Stadium, as they did two years ago, in what I can only imagine was part of some sort of environmental awareness initiative.
3. After running by the Brown defense for the upteenth time, junior wideout Andrew Fischer cannot slow down fast enough before running into some woods behind the stadium, where he is attacked by an actual Brown Bear.
All of those tragedies are more likely than Harvard losing to Brown on the field Saturday.
The Bears have only won the matchup twice since 1999, and based on last week’s performance, win No. 3 is not coming Saturday.
Brown opened its season at Georgetown—Harvard’s opponent next week—with a 17-3 loss a year after smashing the Hoyas, 45-7.
In the loss, Bears quarterback Marcus Fuller completed less than 60 percent of his passes, Brown runners averaged less than three yards per carry, and the Bears turned the ball over four times.
The #struggles come after Brown was forced to replace 11 graduated seniors on offense. And it is not like the new lineup is composed of young guys learning the ropes—Fuller and most of his targets are upperclassmen who could not break into the starting 11 on last year’s team, which was 3-4 in Ivy play.
Basically, Brown’s offense is like The Bucket List: everyone is old, and I would not pay to see it.
With Brown celebrating its 250th anniversary this year, the athletic department has promised a post-game fireworks show Saturday. That is good, because the Bears will not be supplying any fireworks during the game.
Harvard, meanwhile, should bring plenty. The Crimson quietly put up 41 points in its season-opening win against Holy Cross Friday, despite playing much of the game without its three most proven weapons—Hempel, junior running back Paul Stanton, and senior receiver Ricky Zorn.
Hempel has recovered from a back bruise he suffered in the first quarter Friday, and Stanton returns from the preseason ankle injury that sidelined him entirely in week one.
He should be able to make up for lost time Saturday. Brown gave up 250 rushing yards last week to a Georgetown team that still averages only 115 on the year. Even without Stanton, Harvard and its overpowering offensive line accrued 211 yards and three touchdowns on the ground Friday. Stanton could gain that many in the first half tomorrow, and he will finish with however many he wants.
Prediction: Harvard 45, Brown 10
Now, this is normally the point where I’d segue into looking ahead to other action around the Ancient Eight. But there is no other Ivy-on-Ivy action this week.
That means Brown and Harvard will draw the Ivy League’s full attention, like the first gangly pair to step onto the dance floor in 8th grade. Unfortunately for the Bears, the rest of the conference is going to see that Brown’s shoes are untied and its pants are a good six inches too short.
After Roger Williams was rejected from Massachusetts, Providence was established as the country’s first safety city, and Brown has carried that label proudly. Unless Hempel falls in love with Neutral Milk Hotel before the game, the Bears will likely live up to their second-class origins once again.
As for Harvard, the last time the squad was on a bus, they learned that they had won an Ivy title thanks to a Dartmouth upset over Princeton in the final week last year. Following Princeton’s loss to the University of San Diego last week, the Crimson can prove they are the class of the league Saturday with the shortest bus ride of the year. It will feel even shorter after a big win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several days ago, one of my peers discussed the questions that remain unanswered on the gridiron, even after the Harvard football team defeated Holy Cross in its season opener last weekend.
“Now what?” he asked.
This Saturday, under the lights in Providence, R.I., the Crimson will put pen to page, answering that question and opening the 2014 edition of the Ivy League football season against Brown.
With a game each under the their belts, Harvard (1-0) and the Brunos (0-1) face somewhat different predicaments and situations on their respective rosters.
During a lackluster season opener in the nation’s capital, Brown’s novice offense—a full 11 new starters—was unable to mobilize down the field as Georgetown forced four turnovers, all in the first half, to limit the team to just three points and 303 yards through the game. Falling 17-3 to the Hoyas, it was an inauspicious start for senior quarterback Marcus Fuller, whose two interceptions and one rush fumble proved fatal for the Bears. Saturday’s outing will be the first Ancient Eight start for Fuller and the rest of the team’s offensive starters.
“Anytime you only get one game on a guy it’s tough,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I don’t necessarily think anything we saw against Georgetown is really going to give us a hook on Marcus.”
Fuller’s most dependable option will likely lie in junior running back Andrew Coke, who scrambled for 74 yards on the ground and 23 in the air last weekend and 292 total yards last season, or in the more experienced Brian Strachan, a converted wide receiver who sat out last weekend but is the team’s presumed first stringer.
The inexperienced offense will have plenty to fend against, as Harvard’s explosive defense will swarm the line. A group of experienced linebackers, such as juniors Matt Koran and Eric Medes and senior Connor Sheehan took down Crusader after Crusader last week. Senior defensive end Zach Hodges delivered with two sacks while juniors James Duberg and Sean Ahern chipped in one apiece as turnovers came easy for the Crimson against Holy Cross.
“The goal is to create opportunities for our defense,” Hodges said. “Hopefully by moving me around it makes it difficult for other teams and opens up doors for other players.”
And Brown’s defense shouldn’t make life too difficult for Harvard senior quarterback Conner Hempel, who describes himself as “healthy” after sitting out most of the first half with back pain last week, and his solid posse in the backfield and receiving corps.
A milquetoast Bears defense allowed 250 rushing yards last week, which one of their captains attributed to too little aggression and sloppy play. After being relegated to the sidelines during the opener with an ankle injury, junior Harvard tailback Paul Stanton will return to anchor the rushing game.
“We hope that he can come ready to play because he’s one of those guys that does some things you just can’t coach,” Murphy said.
Despite the absence of Stanton­, whose 15 touchdowns led the league’s backs last season, Hempel successfully handed the pigskin off to senior Andrew Casten and tossed to a deep group of receivers last week.
“We have to continue to execute our offense,” Hempel said. “[We have to] execute the plays that are called, and execute the game plan that we have for Brown now instead of Holy Cross. If we execute that we will move the chains and end up scoring touchdowns.”
After the game ends and the Crimson treks back up to Cambridge, a fireworks display will explode over Brown Stadium from 9:10 p.m. to 9:20 p.m. in celebration of Brown’s 250th anniversary. Alumni and students will celebrate, and the field will turn into the location of a festive party.
“This is the biggest game on [Brown’s] schedule,” Murphy said. “They get extremely excited to play Harvard.”
Perhaps, if all goes according to plan for Murphy and his team, those fireworks and that party will be a little less jubilant. Harvard always did do anniversaries better.

As punch season rolls around, once again it’s time to take stock of the social clubs that Harvard has to offer those lucky upperclassmen who find a nice wax-sealed note slipped under their doors. The most visible women’s social clubs on campus are its five final clubs—La Vie, the Sablière, the Isis, Pleiades, and the Bee—and its four sororities—Kappa, Theta, Alpha Phi, and Delta Gamma. And yet there is one women’s social club that doesn’t seem to fit in either category: The Seneca.
Is it a final club? Is it a sorority? Or what?
To get to the bottom of this mystery, I sat down with Anne F. Wenk '15, the President of The Seneca, to figure out what it was all about.
Is The Seneca a final club?
“The Seneca is not a final club,” said Wenk. “The Seneca was actually founded fifteen years ago as a reaction to the punch process. Back then, the campus was very male-dominated. A group of women in Adams decided that this was a hostile environment for women. They saw how, for men, final clubs were not only fun social organizations, but also strong alumni networks that helped its members find jobs after they graduated. Women were really lacking those resources.”
So what is The Seneca?
“The Seneca is a nonprofit female social organization on campus with a dual mission. First, we advocate for women. We helped found the Women’s Center on campus and we also host campus-wide events, like the Women’s Faculty Reception. We also hold workshops for our own members—workshops on public speaking and on what it means to be a woman leader in different career areas. The second part of our mission is to create a social network for each other. We meet once a week for two hours every Wednesday night. We also host events—date events, dinners, mixers with other clubs and organizations on campus.”
What’s the application process like? Do you punch?
“We have an application process, not a punch process. We invite people to apply in their sophomore, junior, or senior year. If you’re interested, there is an open event in the beginning of the application process that anyone can come to. Then you submit an interest form and get enrolled in the process. We make sure we match every applicant with a member to grab a meal and get the chance to talk, one on one.
What’s really important to us is that these applications are name-blind. This has been important to us since our founding. Your name is not associated with the application at all. We are starting our process now and we are so excited to welcome new girls!”

Want to name a waterfall at Harvard Medical School after yourself? No problem, just pony up $2 million.
While the going rate for a Harvard Graduate School is apparently $350 million, you don’t have to write that big of a check to get your name on your own piece of Harvard property.
According to the Harvard Medical School website, there are dozens of “naming opportunities” for generous alumni, provided that you hand over the cash, of course.
To endow, for instance, the Harry Potter Professor of Medicine requires only a $4 million donation, with only half that needed for the librarian equivalent.
And the cheapest naming opportunity available costs only $10,000: your very own chair in the Joseph B. Martin Amphitheater.
But if theater seats and professors are too small potatoes for you, don’t worry, you can name a handful of buildings too.
While the Medical School’s new research building costs $50 million to name, the title rights of the building at 621 Huntington Ave. in Boston can be yours for just $10 million.
These are just the posted prices, however. If recent news shows anything, few things at Harvard are off limits in the naming game. Who knows, someday freshman may be dreading getting stuck in one of three houses in the Mark Zuckerberg Quad or asking for advice from their Bill Gates PAFs. Only time will tell.

Good morning, Harvard, and TGIF! We know how relieved you are that the week is finally coming to an end. Like always, it’s been a long one. Amid the craze of classes, meetings, athletics, and extracurriculars, it’s crazy to think that we’re already four weeks into the semester, over a fourth of the way through it. That’s a potentially panic-inducing statement no matter what year you are; see below.
FreshmanFour weeks in? Why haven’t I seen my third roommate in six days? How are people already involved in all their extracurriculars? Why do I have a midterm on Monday? How come I don’t know who my friends are?
SophomoreFour weeks in? That means I’m halfway to the deadline for declaring my concentration? What is my concentration? Who is my academic advisor? Why don’t I know anyone in my house yet? Why did I commit to so many leadership positions last spring? What even is punch?
JuniorFour weeks in? Wait, I’m over halfway through college by now. What am I doing? Did I even pick the right concentration? So do I need to start thinking about a thesis? What am I doing this summer? Why aren’t I best friends with any faculty yet? Why is that freshman so attractive?
SeniorFour weeks in? Of my last fall semester ever? Is this real? Why did I decide to write a thesis? (or alternatively) Why aren’t I writing a thesis? How does this on-campus interview thing work? How else do I find a job? What am I doing with my life?
Yeah, so seniors take the cake. But hey, we’re all dealing with something. Give yourself the weekend to forget about it all. Have a good one!
IN THE ATMOSPHEREWe’re going to be experiencing a late-September-summer-surge this weekend, with a high of 73 today, moving up to 85 on Sunday, and 0% chance of rain each day! Thank goodness, we were already getting tired of the sweater and jeans uniform that dominates the fall. Take this opportunity to bust out your favorite skirts, dresses, and shorts once again--you probably won’t get one like it until June.

IN THE NEWS1. Unloading the Ad Board: The Administrative Board, as the group of deans and faculty members is known, has remained mostly unchanged since its founding in 1890. But two major policy changes, approved in the span of just two months earlier this year, are set to overhaul its jurisdiction and rework its purpose by next fall.
2. Anthropology Library Reopens: After 18 months of construction originally projected to cost $12 million, the now-LEED gold-certified Tozzer Library, the country’s oldest anthropology collection, reopened in mid-June.

Before anyone even noticed that upperclassman resident deans had been renamed “House deans,” administrators changed their name again (they’re now “assistant deans of Harvard College”). To save the College some time when it inevitably changes the title again (likely in the next one to three days), we've decided to offer up a few suggestions:
1. T.H. Chan Assistant Deans of Harvard College
With a donation that large, the Chan family should have convinced Harvard to rename every position, building, library, dining hall, and grill special after them. (Unfortunately, the T.H. Chan turkey burger with avocado doesn’t seem like a likely prospect).
2. Allston Burr Residential Assistant Deans of Harvard College of Harvard University of Cambridge, Massachusetts
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said earlier this week that deans wanted their title to be easier for people outside Harvard to understand. What better name to choose in this case than one that specifies literally every facet of the position? Just in case anyone outside Cambridge was curious.
3. Dean Khuranas #2-18
This choice of title not only pays tribute to Harvard’s new and lovable dean, but also makes it less wordy. (If the College chooses to adopt such a title, every resident dean must acquire an equally adorable social media presence via Instagram).
