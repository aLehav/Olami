With Tropical Storm Isaac gaining strength in the gulf and Republicans digging in to ride out the storm ahead of their quadrennial national convention in Tampa, Fla., the delegation from Harvard's Institute of Politics took to national airwaves Sunday with its first event of the convention season.
The IOP kicked off its convention program with Politics & The Media: Bridging The Divide In The 2012 Election, a forum co-hosted with Bloomberg News and the University of Southern California on Sunday afternoon. The panel discussion, which featured New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson '76, Romney strategist Russ Schriefer, and IOP Director Trey M. Grayson '94, among others, can be viewed on C-SPAN or on the IOP website.
Weather permitting, the IOP will host a cocktail reception for current and former Harvard affiliates attending the convention on Monday. On Tuesday, Grayson will moderate a lunch discussion titled 'The Millennial Impact on the 2012 Election.'
