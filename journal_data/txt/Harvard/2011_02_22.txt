After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Devon Ray Williams ’10-’11—who just released his first hip-hop album “High Time” last Monday while balancing school and ultimate frisbee practice—is not your average college senior. Though just a few semesters ago he was a computer science concentrator considering a full-time job at Microsoft after graduation, Williams now devotes the majority of his free time to his true passion: making music. In one word, he calls his new album “relevant,” and proves that the road less traveled is sometimes the road with the most potential.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell me a little bit about your new album?
Devon Ray Williams: It’s called “High Time.” The first half is about social justice issues ... the second half is about my romantic justice [and] getting back from all the relationship issues I’ve had. I knew as soon as I wrote one verse of “High Time” that it was going to be the title song of the album because it just embodied [my ideas] completely. It’s high time that I do this ... it’s high time that people listen to what is happening in the world around them, and it’s high time that hip-hop artists talk about more relevant things.
THC: And you’re distributing this album for free?
DRW: I know that’s kind of unconventional. I’m not distributing it for free because I don’t think I could sell it—I think I could—but even if the number of people listen to my music is only 10 times greater, that’s still a huge gain.
THC: Can you talk about taking two semesters off and the reason why you did it?
DRW: I was originally Class of 2010, and halfway through my senior year—three semesters into my computer science major—I realized I [didn’t] know what I [wanted] to do ... so I took a year off. The first half [of the year] I spent doing computer science work ... but I realized that even though I enjoyed it, my true passion is music. One of my best friends, my roommate, said “you know what, Devon, if that’s your passion, you just need to suck it up and do an album and have it ready when you get back to school.” The past six months I’ve spent working my tail off on this album, and here we are.
THC: How did you become interested in music?
DRW: I came from a musical background—I was raised in church ... a different vibe than hip-hop. Getting here as a freshman I started doing more acoustic stuff. I got into hip-hop by doing a satirical song: the “My House” video for housing day for Mather House. I realized hey, I’m actually not that bad at doing hip-hop.
THC: How has being a computer science concentrator helped or hindered your musical projects?
DRW: If anything, it’s helped with the marketing. Now I design my own website, I design my own artwork, I design my own flyers. It’s nice to not have to shell out money for that.
THC: Who are some of your favorite artists that you draw inspiration from?
DRW: Kanye West is a huge influence. People can go on and on about his character ... I don’t like to be involved in people’s characters, as far as stars. I really appreciate the musicality that he introduces to the genre. As far as lyrically and content-wise, Lupe Fiasco is another huge influence because he talks about real things. He’s built an audience who appreciates what he does and that’s what I hope to do.
THC: Do you think it’s necessary to adopt a stage persona or an alter ego to perform in this business?
DRW: I think they are very important. I don’t want to box myself into one per se, but a lot of people ... assume that the music is speaking from personal experience—that it’s autobiographical. That’s fair because that’s the precedent. But when you look at poetry or writing or just prose in general, it’s taboo to assume that the narrator is the same as the author. I didn’t really do it much in this album, but one of my goals as I develop into a better artist is to be able to take on different personas in different songs. It would be nice to stretch the music and be able to be an artist who, in the song, [may not] actually be Devon Ray.
THC: What are your goals with regard to your music, both short and long term?
DRW: It’s only a couple of months until I graduate, so I don’t expect for this to take off like crazy. That’d be sweet, but it doesn’t happen like that. My goal is to get to a point at the end of this semester where I know if I can pursue this or not.
THC: What’s your advice for anyone trying to make it in this business?
DRW: My advice for anyone trying to get into this is honestly just love it. Love it completely. You’ve gotta still pursue important things like school. There’s definitely a way in this business to have your cake and eat it too, at least for a little while.

Last Friday, the Harvard Dance Center’s Studio 1 was transformed into a black box theater. Boston Ballet’s Artistic Director Mikko Nissinen told his audience, “I hope to show the progress of the art form through the eyes of contemporary repertoire.” The evening’s sampling of contemporary works, presented as “Boston Ballet Dance Talk” by the Office for the Arts at Harvard, showcased the versatility of Nissinen’s dancers as well as his vision for Boston Ballet in the local community. The company dancers performed strikingly innovative choreographies of William Forsythe, Helen Pickett, and Boston Ballet’s Resident Choreographer Jorma Elo with all the raw athleticism and finesse that contemporary ballet demands. Nissinen has brought a fresh artistic vision to the young, forward-thinking Boston audience while maintaining his company’s force in the classical tradition. In the same way, the Boston Ballet dancers displayed an invigorating spectrum of repertoire that was never too far removed from its classical roots.
Unlike performances at the Boston Opera House, the company’s home theater, “Dance Talk” was a uniquely intimate glimpse of Boston Ballet. Nissinen and Ballet Master Anthony Randazzo spoke about each choreographer and their work before each of the evening’s pieces. The first work presented was an excerpt from “The Second Detail,” choreographed by one of the pioneers of contemporary ballet, William Forsythe.
“The physical demand and musical complexity of Forsythe’s work changed the way we look at ballet,” Randazzo said. “The Second Detail” was no exception. The excerpt performed—taken from the climax of the full-length work— featured a bold interplay of physical power between seven male and seven female dancers. Against the strong, almost abrasive beat of Thom Willem’s electronic rhythms, the dancers darted across the stage: their arms and legs extended, flexing in sharp geometries, then flowing to fluid, arcing forms. Principal Lia Cirio’s movement onstage exuded an energy that seemed to hold together the dynamic of the entire group.
The forceful opening of “The Second Detail” was softened by the evening’s second excerpt, Helen Pickett’s “Tsukiyo.” A lilting and sensuous pas de deux—a dance between a man and a woman—Pickett’s work offered an interesting stylistic contrast to the preceding piece: Pickett was one of Forsythe’s own dancers at the Frankfurt Ballet decades ago. A piece with a subtle Japanese undertone, “Tsukiyo” (Moonlit Night) opened with Principal Misa Kuranaga kneeling on a black pedestal in front of a large, hanging translucent disc decorated with Japanese floral designs. From afar, Kuranaga seemed to be floating gracefully in midair. Kuranaga and Principal Yury Yanowsky’s delicate movements were fitting complements to the fragility of Arvo Pärt’s composition for violin. Their gentle and sometimes forceful manipulation of each other’s movement evoked at points a sense of wonder, at others of desperation. However, the calm, even feel of “Tsukiyo” and Pärt’s music may be most interesting when tempered by the more dynamic movements in Pickett’s full-length work, “Pärt I, II, and III.” In all senses, “Tsukiyo” seemed a piece about exploration.
The last excerpt featured was Jorma Elo’s “Plan to B,” a prelude to Boston Ballet’s spring production “Elo Experience,” a show entirely devoted to Elo’s work (March 24-April 3). “Jorma choreographed his piece at a very vulnerable time in his life … when he decided to retire from dancing,” Nissinen said. “‘Plan to B’ is a reflection of his struggle: it is full of the hesitation and nervous energy he experienced as he took the leap to ‘stop taking leaps,’” Nissinen continued. The six dancers in “Plan to B” exemplified the uniqueness of Elo’s movement style amidst fellow contemporary choreographers. The dancers’ windmilling arms and swinging legs were often punctuated by rapid synchronous turns, evoking an altogether circular, sinuous movement that as Nissinen said, was “so Jorma.”
At the end of the evening, Nissinen and Randazzo welcomed a broad range of questions from the audience about everything from the dance steps performed to the life of a company director. When asked of his opinion on Darren Aronofsky’s hit film, “Black Swan,” Nissinen said with a laugh, “Though it does not do a disservice to the art, it is certainly an exaggeration.”
Nevertheless, Nissinen said the movie did speak to the life of the professional dancer. “Life as dancer is incredibly difficult, incredibly demanding—and yet, it is simply wonderful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since before I can remember, my father has called me Puki. He always told me it meant jaguar. He said he looked at little baby me and it just came out: Puki. (There was also a period of time when he called me Piolín, Tweety Bird. Go figure.) I have a large t-shirt with an orange jaguar head in profile on the front, but I no longer wear it to sleep for fear that it might fall apart after all these years. Along the bottom it reads: “Ocelotl-Puki-Jaguar-Balam.” Jaguar makes sense; I recognize that word in Spanish and English. Ocelotl makes sense; hence ocelot, a word for another spotted big cat. Balam, too, rings a bell: the Books of Chilam Balam constitute a well-known set of Mayan religious works attributed to a jaguar-priest. But Puki? Where did that come from?
Puki, I decided, had to mean jaguar; otherwise my father’s name for me was nothing more than a misnomer, a mistake. Google search failed me at first; but eventually I found that Puki does mean jaguar in the language of the Purépechas, an indigenous people who live in what is now the state of Michoacán, México. In Pre-Columbian times, they were one of the few groups not devoured by the great Aztec empire.
It makes me happy to know that my dad’s nickname for me does indeed have a historical, almost primordial basis. I wasn’t exaggerating: I would have experienced a true crisis had it all turned out to be a hoax. It may seem little more than a simple pet name, but because my dad has called me Puki all my life the jaguar makes up part of the way I think about myself, part of the way I live my life. I like to pass unnoticed if I can, silently and lithely like a cat; but when I want something, I go for the kill. When I feel overwhelmed, I just remind myself to be a Puki—to watch attentively in the night, to step confidently and quietly.
Comforted by the assurance that I do on some level have a connection to the jaguar, I went to the third floor of the Peabody Museum to find a cat with whom to share the good news. In the “Encounters with the Americas” exhibit I stood under the watch of Mayan gods carved into the tall stone-carved stele that fill the room with their quiet majesty, and I found two black ceramic urns with lids topped by jaguar heads baring their teeth. Their eyes were upturned as if to defy whoever might handle them to remove the lids. Both urns were etched with intricate designs that showed up white against the black. I wasn’t tall enough to look down into their eyes and tell them we were related.
For Mesoamerican people living before the arrival of the Spanish, the jaguar was a great and divine animal, not least because of its fearsome physical powers. It was the only big cat that could also swim. High-ranking Aztec warriors wore jaguar skins as a sign of their status. The Olmecs considered themselves “People of the Jaguar”—that is, descendants of jaguars. The entrances of Pre-Hispanic temples are often carved to depict the mouths of jaguars, evoking the primordial cave of origins.
For many Mesoamericans the jaguar was more than just a symbol; it was the crux of their identities. According to many religions of the region, each person had a ‘nahual,’ a soul that was the consciousness’s other half. This nahual came in the form of an animal. In describing such a shamanic Mayan transformation, Antonio de Jesús Magril writes, “he saw that from his mouth came the tiger, or the lion, or the animal he wanted to become ... He could feel that his nahual was coming and understood that it was his soul” (my translation). This transformation and self-actualization is an image Isabel Allende exploited in her novel “La Ciudad de las Bestias” (The City of the Beasts), in which her character Alexander Cold transforms into a black jaguar, his nahual.
I would like to think that my nahual is a Puki. Perhaps it is a silly myth to hold on to; but, after all, it is a name I respond to. If my dad calls me “Alex,” I know something is wrong. If he calls me “Puki,” I know we are on good terms. I am following in the footsteps of the Purépechas, the people who call the jaguar Puki, the people who gave me my nahual, the people who refused to succumb to the Aztec empire and an imposed identity.

In my freshman year of high school, I mastered the art of not paying attention in class. In particular, I mastered the art of hiding my Game Boy behind my chemistry textbook. “Aha!” I’d think to myself as the teacher surveyed the room and failed to give me so much as a second look. “I am so sneaky and clever!”
In hindsight, I’m fairly certain I was not being very sneaky or clever. My teachers had to know what I was up to, but fortunately they never scolded me. Instead, they left me free to tear through the “Fire Emblem” series, a dangerously addictive set of games in which you direct an army of knights and mages against the forces of evil.
So last semester, when I discovered “Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance” (FE:PoR), a “Fire Emblem” game made for Nintendo’s GameCube, I had to play it.
FE:PoR is set in a fantasy universe where, apparently, access to absurdly-colored hair dye is both cheap and extremely in vogue: if I had a dollar for every pink-, purple-, orange-, green-, and blue-haired character I encountered during my quest, I could pay half my tuition bill. You assume the role of Ike, an idealistic, courageous young swordsman who is a member of his father’s mercenary company. (But don’t fret! Ike’s mercenary band is a bunch of good guy mercenaries. They spend their time saving peasants from bandits, because that’s a completely plausible business model.)
The plot that follows is riddled with fantasy clichés: of course the mercenaries are employed to protect a mysterious princess; of course Ike and the princess fall in love; and, of course, there’s some dark, evil force that’s been sealed away for ages, waiting to reemerge and threaten the existence of humanity itself.
Clichéd though the plot may be, the characters are surprisingly endearing. Throughout the game, you’ll recruit a hilariously overzealous knight, a cunning and manipulative lady-mage, and—my personal favorite—Haar, a lazy knight who spends most of his time shirking work and sneaking off to take naps. (“Oh man,” a friend of mine commented while watching me play, “that Haar guy totally acts just like you!”)
The actual gameplay is similar to chess—if chess pieces were paladins and pegasus knights instead of pawns and rooks. And if chess pieces could hurl fireballs and lances at each other. And if you could recruit new chess pieces as the game progresses.
Okay, so maybe it’s not a lot like chess, but the general idea of two armies battling in a tactical, turn-based format is still there. And if you’re like me, whenever it’s the enemy’s turn, you’ll spend the whole time crossing your fingers and praying to God that your precious, weak pegasus knight doesn’t get grazed by a stray arrow, because if she dies you’ll have to start the battle all over again.
Q: But Julie! This is a tactical war game! Doesn’t that mean you can always just buy more faceless grunts to do your bidding?
A: Nope. There’s a limited number of characters. If you let too many of them die, then good luck getting through the game.
Q: But surely I can revive characters! There’s a spell for that or something, right?
A: Nope.
Q: But—but that’s really annoying!
A: YES IT IS.
This feature is what makes “Fire Emblem” both one of the most frustrating and one of the most rewarding video games ever.
Frustrating, because I can guarantee you anyone who’s ever beaten a “Fire Emblem” game has a story that goes like this: “There I was. I’d eliminated every single one of the enemies. I’d recruited every possible potential ally into my army. I had gotten all the items. The boss had only one hit point remaining, and the most powerful knight in my army had a perfect position from which to kill him. But THEN the stupid knight tripped, missed, and the boss proceeded to land a critical hit and KILL MY GOSHDANGED KNIGHT AND I HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.”
But at the same time, when you finally do manage to win these epic battles, you feel like more than a tactical genius or an elite warrior. You feel godlike. You kept every single person from dying. You left no man behind. Take that, “Saving Private Ryan.”
Given the fact that this game is easily twice as long as its Game Boy counterparts, it’s probably a good thing that it was released for GameCube—otherwise, I’d relapse to my old high school ways and start playing it during class. But hey, at least saving princesses and slaying dragons in lecture would be a bit more epic than the usual Facebooking.

People who love books tend to want all of their own together, in one place, and preferably nearby. Part of this is utility; what good is having a book if you can’t use it? But beyond that, like any collection, they express an entire personality—who you are, or at least who you want to be. This isn’t to say that they’re just window-dressing, of course. The books you own are part of how you explain yourself to yourself. Whether you grew up with Madeleine L’Engle or Philip Pullman; whether you liked “The Scarlet Letter” or “The Great Gatsby” best in high school; whether you’re an Alice Munro person, a Lydia Davis person, or both—this is a deeply felt part of who you are, and everyone who owns even a few books knows it.
Taking a few books from home to college is like taking a cutting of one tree to start another. The graft has the same genetic character as the old library, but in miniature, and it gradually takes on a life of its own. It’s of the same species, but its limbs sprawl and stretch in completely different directions in its new climate. Preparing for moving into college freshman year, I’d carefully chosen a few favorites—a couple gift books, a favorite novel or two, a dictionary to help me keep up my high school French, and a Modern Language Association (MLA) guide. But this new sister library was, over time, colored by the courses I took, the cheap paperbacks picked up in the basement of Harvard Book Store, the occasional reading for free moments; its shade was deeper, its fruit had a different taste, it reflected a different side of me. And, by the time the year came to an end, I had a huge problem: how was I going to get all this stuff home?
I realized that I’d grown two separate libraries, anchored in two different spots, and trying to get them all in one place again would take about as much effort as moving a tree. Books root you to a place. They are large, heavy, low-mobility objects; and when you own and love them, it is hard to leave them. It is also hard to take them anywhere. They are a sign that your life has a center—a staging ground or home base from which everything else is seen. Part of me believes that having a split library is like loving two sister trees in different orchards: they’re the same, but different, and always seem to be calling out to one another from a distance, longing to be reunited.
Last year, I tried to keep a lot of my books in summer storage. I wrapped most of my books up in some kind of turbo Saran wrap from Staples and packed them in boxes, hoping that the basement wouldn’t flood. They emerged unscathed, though I think my building manager might have a heart attack if he realized how much space they actually took up. (It’s not something I’m hoping to repeat.) In order to avoid the issue this year, I’m trying to find ways to get a lot of them back home early. Thank God for the postal service. Books are notoriously expensive to ship, but the flat-rate boxes seem to be a good solution. The large ones are $15 each, better by far than either shipping by weight or by media mail, which charges $4 per book.
And so the other day I found myself dragging two large flat-rate boxes of books in a carry-on suitcase to the post office on the corner of Mt. Auburn and Story. I felt bad about sending them home, but I had looked at them long and hard and determined that there was absolutely no chance I would be able to read them while I was at school. I will never find the free time for the odes of Horace or “The Return of the Native” or, Lord knows, the Arcades Project during the term. And so, as much as I love them, I shipped them back home like an aggrieved parent might ship off a particularly rambunctious pre-adolescent to boarding school. Good riddance.

“I can make guys cry, in song and in real life, as well. I’m good at that,” claimed British singer/songwriter Adele in an interview with music blog Spinner, in response to an outbreak of crying men listening to her sing.
Adele became an international singing sensation in 2009 when her debut album “19” earned her a Best New Artist Grammy. On her most recent release, “21” Adele evokes heavier blues and unexpected bluegrass influences while straying from her traditional pop vocals. Though this gives “21” a different feel than her earlier work, the core of the album is as powerful as ever. “21” is buoyed by gut-wrenching lyrics and the same emotionally charged ballads that let her show off her vocal versatility and make all those boys start sobbing.
Adele claims to have been exposed to country and rockabilly on an American tour. Her newfound Southern charm is evident on the album’s first single, “Rolling in the Deep,” a dark and soulful tune with haunting back-up vocals and a bridge replete with stomps and hand-claps. “Rolling in the Deep” is a revenge anthem on which Adele’s robust voice takes over the martial drums and the penetrating bluesy piano to lament despairingly, “We could have it all / Rolling in the deep / You had my heart inside of your hands / And you played it to the beat.” The song is brilliantly produced, from the muted guitar in the beginning to the slow drumbeat that allows Adele to build gradually to an emotional climax. Though the rockabilly influences are new, the emotion of the track is as powerful as ever.
These country inspirations can be heard on multiple tracks, most notably “Don’t You Remember.” On this track, Adele admits to her flaws in a relationship, singing vulnerably over her acoustic guitar, “I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness / And a wandering eye / And a heaviness in my head.” Where Adele’s first album focused on being heartbroken by the transgressions of another, “21” shows a progression in her maturity: while this album also deals in similar themes of heartbreak, Adele sings about relationships in their entirety—her flaws included—and the change reveals hidden depths to her lyrics.
Adele makes bold statements with this album, proving that sensitive matters of the heart are of no concern to her. With touchy subjects that would normally be difficult for anybody to describe, Adele is brazen; she uses robust vocals and powerful piano ballads to heft her difficult themes. On “Take It All,” Adele demands answers, asking “Didn’t I give it up? / Tried my best / Gave you everything I had / Everything and no less” while her back-up singers support her in a gospel style clearly reminiscent of Aretha Franklin.
The inspiration of soul legends is evident throughout “21,” but this does not prevent Adele from attempting the unexpected: covering The Cure. Adele takes on “Lovesong,” stripping the song of its original gothic rock sound and giving it a seductively smooth, jazzy energy. Adele empowers Robert Smith’s lyrics. She appropriates the track through her lush sound and dreamy arrangements. This song is yet another example of Adele’s increasingly defined sound, as she is able to turn one of The Cure’s most famous hits into something that sounds like it was written just for her.
Through the complex vocals, articulate writing, and new influences of “21,” Adele’s fans will be able to see a change in her; rather than sticking to the pop-soul that made her famous, she takes her listeners on a versatile journey of foot-stomping blues, head-nodding retro-pop, and finger-snapping jazz. Though artists often have difficulty using new sounds while retaining their original styles, Adele does so effortlessly, with emotional tracks that faithfully represent the multifaceted nature of her sultry voice. Heartbreak is nothing new for Adele, but she takes on an entirely different approach to prove something she did not demonstrate on her first release: that she is not just emulating the greats, she’s becoming one.

It has only been a year since Chazwick Bundick, the man behind Toro y Moi, last released anything, but his new album “Underneath the Pine” represents such a huge growth in maturity that it may as well have been a decade. “Underneath the Pine” may only seem like Bundick’s jump from one short-sighted musical trend to the next—chillwave to the electro-throwback that defined last year’s indie rock—but the music that results is often so compelling and well-crafted that it transcends trend-surfing to a new level of musicianship that is nuanced, organic, and just plain funky.
Toro Y Moi’s move away from chillwave is evident on the album’s first single, “Still Sound.” The track is a static, mid-tempo tune riding the momentum of a repeated bass lick backed by minimal drums and some late-’60s electric piano. The mere presence of instrumentation is indicative of how much this album differs from its sample-heavy predecessor, “Causers of This.” One of the best characteristics of the single is its immediately apparent sense of being played by a full band, of a live and improvisatory quality absent from the last album and from chillwave in general. It even features a short but savory electric piano solo before the bridge, and employs some jazz fusion sounds that are refreshing even in an age of throwbacks.
Accordingly, the album opens with a wordless track showcasing the new instrumentals. “Intro Chi Chi” begins with a sunny muddle of acoustic, electric, and vocal sounds before falling into a laid-back groove of bass and some churning electronics. The electronics are tastefully incorporated, used for mood-making nuance rather than showing off. “New Beat” just begs to be accompanied by grainy footage of long-haired teens playing Frisbee: it’s beyond retro, but when the band joins together for the aggressively catchy line during the chorus, it becomes easy to forget how recycled this music is.
Perhaps one of the only aspects of this album that suffers from the outset is the lyrics. Bundick’s lyrics are more discernible here than in the past, and that’s not necessarily a plus. Consistently hackneyed and forgettable, they deliver that particular blend of indie loneliness and longing that rings of the inauthentic. On “Go With You,” for example, Bundick emotes about an escape he is planning with his addressee for some unexplained reason. Clichés abound when he reaches the last lines of the verse: “And I won’t care leaving everyone behind / ’Cause I’ve got them all leaving with me in my mind.” Such mundane observations about generic situations permeate the album. Bundick never truly escapes the limitations of vagueness, a fault which leaves the lyrics frequently inscrutable. Ultimately, the lyrical emphasis on melancholy themes occasionally overshadows how much fun these songs really are.
Despite the lyrics, the album remains strong throughout its central portion. The music provides enough variation of mood and timbre—the sudden acoustic guitar intro on “Before I’m Done,” for example—to remain engaging. “How I Know” is a glowing highlight, a mid-tempo tune where Bundick’s songwriting finally seems to have reached the level of musicianship that characterizes the instrumentation on the rest of the album. When he finally breaks into a tremendous outro, it is nearly impossible to resist the urge to sing along. This is throwback bubblegum pop at its best; it is a perfect thesis statement for the album, and for Bundick’s work in general. “Are you havin’ fun?” he inquires, and it would be hard not to answer “yes.”
Unfortunately, “Underneath the Pine” ends on a faltering note. After the stellar “Still Sound,” “Good Hold” turns out to be a tremendous let-down—a song that seems badly conceived and extremely out of place. When it abruptly breaks down into flashy phaser effects at the end, it sounds like a track off Bundick’s first album, and the song suffers the consequences of overproduction. “Elise,” the six-minute outro, cannot completely recover from this misstep, relying so heavily on the pop sounds of the late ’60s that it almost directly quotes The Mamas and the Papas’ “California Dreaming.” When the album ends at a mere 39 minutes, it short-changes the glory of the first half-hour.
It may not be a masterpiece, but “Underneath the Pine” is a huge step in the right direction for Toro y Moi—an extremely listenable piece of retro pop that will undoubtedly worm its way into the ears of listeners new and old.

Announced and released in rapid succession last week, Radiohead’s eighth studio album “The King of Limbs” consolidates the phase-change inaugurated in the lush, melodic pop of its 2007 predecessor “In Rainbows.” Following through on that album’s organic production style, Radiohead has crafted its most sonically rich effort to date by building tracks from within dense, rhythmic worlds whose warmth rejects any confusion with the spare, lunar soundscapes of “Kid A.” Gone, too, is the self-conscious eccentricity—in lyrics and arrangement—of the band’s middle period, whose weight so troubled the overlong “Hail to the Thief.”
Amidst forward motion so thorough, however, Radiohead has mistaken leanness for fitness. Beyond mere thematic vestiges, “The King of Limbs” sheds something more local and altogether more crucial to Radiohead’s generation-spanning success as a premiere creative force in mainstream music: pop sensibility. The labored quality of the album’s songwriting relinquishes any aural leap forward to more of a source of reverent curiosity than real engagement, and at a brisk 37 minutes—their shortest long-player to date—excessive drag leaves the record feeling consequently slight.
The problem becomes apparent on the album’s two most overt attempts at pop songcraft within the band’s new, more rhythmic songwriting structure. The deftness of arrangement on “Little By Little”—led by Colin Greenwood’s bass and restrained sitar flourishes, presumably by brother Jonny—doesn’t prevent the song from stalling out on Thom Yorke’s repetitious, fairly procedural vocals. There’s also the problem of lyrics—“I am such a tease and you are such a flirt,” etc.—and Yorke’s stunted insight when it comes to writing love songs, a holdover from “All I Need” and “House of Cards” on “In Rainbows.”
On “Lotus Flower,” the album’s first single and the track on “The King of Limbs” that most encapsulates the album’s aspirations, most of the lyrics are rendered superfluous by Yorke’s in-form falsetto. Once again, bassist Greenwood and drummer Phil Selway are in the foreground, constructing an intricate and infectious beat, while the rest of the band lays down guitar textures and handclaps. But as happens too often on “The King of Limbs,” the band becomes complacent: Yorke repeats chorus and verse, and the beat marches on in the absence of any dynamic tension, leaving the song feeling like something of an exercise.
It’s this static quality that hampers the promising opener “Bloom,” which begins with a shimmering array of percussive and electronic samples, fit to build towards the kind of crescendo with which “In Rainbows” positively bristled. Instead, Yorke’s voice enters at a low register, and the song never lifts off. Plodding repetition wouldn’t be sufficient to torpedo the beautiful piano dirge “Codex,” if Yorke’s vocals—put to good use here driving the melody—didn’t leave the song sounding altogether perversely like a Coldplay ballad.
These criticisms are, of course, all relative. A weak album by Radiohead—which “The King of Limbs” is, the weakest in quite a while—compares favorably to the strongest efforts by most bands in this or any other decade. What’s troubling, however, is the prospect that this is not a misstep but simply a next step; that Radiohead, taking longer to write less, is low on ideas. But something brilliant stirs in the album’s final act. “Give Up The Ghost,” a forlorn acoustic fragment blended masterfully with layered samples of Yorke singing his own backup, lends the album a fragile loveliness that’s been rare since Radiohead’s first releases. The song’s bare aesthetic serves as a reminder that despite Radiohead’s renewed emphasis on collaborative composition—an emphasis perhaps responsible for what might be construed as underachievement on “The King of Limbs”—the burden of songwriting is left to bear on Yorke.
He earns that faith on “Separator,” the solitary classic on this latest endeavor. Here, Selway’s intricate drumwork serves as an anchor for Yorke’s vocals in the fullness of their range as well as, happily, the full brightness of Jonny Greenwood’s guitar later on. The extra jolt that the lead guitarist can provide is one of the band’s finest weapons, and it’s woefully underused on the album until now. The simplicity, the sheer joy of the track is out of place on the record—or any other Radiohead record, really—but the ease of this seeming harmony is undeniable. A soulfulness that has eluded the Oxfordshire quintet for four decades is strangely, for a moment, in view. “If you think this is over then you’re wrong,” Yorke almost teases. For a band whose relationship with celebrity has been often ambivalent, it’s a rare gesture of contentment with their place and with their art. More than one generation considers a new Radiohead album a cause for celebration—a phenomenon that’s become increasingly scarce in an industry where stardom has become more fleeting. Distribution strategies aside, “The King of Limbs” was just that: a celebration, and an event. If its music hasn’t measured up, then the fans will wait for the next one. And if it takes 10 years, they’ll still be waiting.

Radio broadcasting has been around since the 1920s, when it was primetime entertainment, but has since been in tough competition with other attractions like television and increasingly accessible internet options like YouTube and torrent downloads. Though radio offers a unique experience for the listener, many find the medium increasingly anachronistic.
Consequently, stations like the student-run Harvard Radio Broadcasting (WHRB) are driven to offer more programming options to encourage listeners to tune in. One such program is WHRB’s weekly Live Lunch Jazz Fridays sessions. Musicians from the mecca of local and professional jazz talent play on-site as the station broadcasts their performance live; the sessions serve as an opportunity for musicians to share their creativity and as a window onto the vibrant Boston music scene for listeners.
General manager Carl A. Pillot ’12, who was last year’s jazz director, said he resurrected the jazz sessions in spring 2010 from an unfinished project of his predecessor Isaac Shivvers ’10-’11. Pillot created the performance schedule from a number of musicians Shivvers had contacted and from responses from a number of music schools around Boston. “There were a lot of people interested in playing,” he said.
The WHRB sessions host a wide range of musicians, including professional bands and local students like jazz pianist Malcolm G. Campbell ’10 and saxophonist Kazemde A. George ’12, both enrolled jointly at New England Conservatory and Harvard. Although Pillot could not say how many people tuned in, he said that the radio station targets the whole Boston community in addition to Harvard students.
For musicians, playing live on radio offers a unique performance experience free from the influence of an audience. Saxophonist Kevin Sun ’14, another NEC/Harvard joint concentrator who played on air earlier this month and a Crimson magazine editor, said, “[It] is actually more relaxed to play on the radio than to play in a concert hall or a venue like a club. You could make the case that it’d be more sterile to play in that environment because there’s no one goading you on.”
The live session also allows touring groups to gain publicity for shows. “If groups have an event coming up in Cambridge, we like to fit them [in] and promote that event, so it’s beneficial for them,” Pillot said. Bands like Jeremy de Jésus, featured on the show last Friday, always try to find opportunities to perform when they’re not studying at the Berklee School of Music and New England Conservatory.
Despite the range of genres and live programming offered, according to Sun, WHRB listenership is limited to a smaller but dedicated community of music aficionados. “I think reasons for that may include the lack of time,” he said. “Students—they don’t listen to the radio. I also think students aren’t aware that there’s a 24-hour student radio station that can be streamed online.” He added, “if you’re doing work and just want to listen to music, just go on the website and put on the stream and put the music on the background and study or work. You never know what you might find. That’s the great thing.”
This idea particularly resonates with the Live Lunch Jazz Friday program. The diversity of musicians in these regular sessions offers both new and experienced listeners the opportunity to discover up-and-coming musicians as well as new fusions of jazz and other genres. The show is especially conducive to jazz performances, as live broadcasts allow the listener to hear the live improvisations so essential to the music. In addition to the live jazz sessions, which air weekly at 11:30am, WHRB 95.3FM hosts rock concerts most Fridays, airs the Metropolitan Opera’s Saturday performances from New York City, and plans to launch live classical sessions in the near future. With a number of live performance programs in several genres, the station allows listeners to venture out from their musical comfort zones and explore the many vibrant genres of music.

Dan Sousa is not a typical animator. Instead of creating films with strong narrative structure and central characters, he prefers to captivate his audience with an immediate visceral reaction. According to Sousa, he “wasn’t even conscious of animation as an art form,” while growing up, and attended the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) to study painting. Eventually, however, he combined his passion for animation, his formal artistic training, and his personal fascination with mythology to create emotionally rich stories infused with elements of mysticism and suspense.
In a February 16 talk at the Carpenter Center, Sousa discussed his past works, interspersing his commentary with screenings of his films. Ruth Lingford, Professor of the Practice of Animation at Harvard, introduced the talk, describing the animator’s work as “both incredibly aesthetically beautiful and nuanced. Its aesthetic sensibility is paired with a deep humanism.” Lingford, also the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Visual and Environmental Studies, added, “I never watch his films without thinking, ‘I just couldn’t do that.’ The two words which epitomize his work are gravity and grace.”
Sousa showcased his five films in chronological order, beginning with his degree project from RISD. “Carnal Ground” (1994), Sousa recalled, “started as an illustration of Cain and Abel, but became the story of a man and a beast in the wild. The man is torn between becoming friends with this animal and killing it for food.”
Sousa’s early projects “tended to focus on the internal struggles between intellectual and cultural pressures.” He soon began to draw inspiration from mythology, however, a fascination that manifested itself in his 1999 film “Minotaur”. “I wanted to focus on the point of view of the beast, not Theseus, the hero,” Sousa said. “What would it feel like to be trapped in a labyrinth? I saw the beast as this child who would lash out in violence.”
For Sousa, animation offers the “ideal medium” to explore complex topics like psychological conflict. “In animation, every frame is precious, representing a unique moment in time,” he said. “With my films, I seek to probe the fragility of moments, to see how long I can have a moment last onscreen.” Since animation as an art form is linked more to painting than to traditional storytelling, these moments are often conveyed through symbolic imagery.
In particular, these strong visual symbols vivify films like Sousa’s 2005 project “Fable.” Alive with bloody footprints, moving wallpaper and a panicked heartbeat, the film combines momentary terror with constant unsettlement, presenting in a world in which a man and a woman struggle to reconcile their human and animal forms, including their violent bloodlust for each other.
Sousa drew on experiences from his own life for his next two expressive and emotionally- charged pieces. “To get to a point where a work is very honest, it must come from personal observation,” he said. “Windmill,” a 2007 film, was inspired by a building located near Sousa’s former home in Portugal. “It was an abandoned windmill, at the edge of the forest. Going there, I felt somewhere between civilization and wilderness.” As in “Fable,” the main character, from whose perspective the story is told, changes into an animal  at the film’s conclusion. Yet in contrast to the sanguine monstrosity of Sousa’s earlier protagonist, the hero of “Windmill” slowly transforms into a bird, finally soaring to the top of the structure.
While several of Sousa’s films carry deep symbolic and psychological weight, other projects merely convey moments of artistic beauty. “Drift,” a 2009 film, was inspired by Sousa’s observations of shadows and leaves moving across the plains. Without using words or even characters, Sousa was thus able to capture a story that was “more universal—anyone around the world can watch the film and see what’s going on.”
Whether probing the dark crevasses of the human mind, or simply crafting delicate studies in aesthetic pleasure, Sousa’s films consistently captivated his audience. Basia Goszczynska, a fellow professional animator in attendance, remarked that she has been a fan of Sousa’s work for a couple of years. “It was an amazing experience to see all his work in one sitting, especially in chronological order,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Experience it. Enjoy it. Just don’t fall for it.” So goes the tagline for “Almost Famous,” a movie in which the protagonist must negotiate the conflicting philosophies of a decadent world of rockstar debauchery and the intellectual gravity espoused by his mother. While characters find themselves increasingly caught up in the entrancing world of rock and roll, its risk and danger become clear by the film’s end.
Members of Harvard student bands face a similar dilemma. Though these students would like to engage with their passion for playing music at a serious level, they face pressing obstacles. The lack of institutional support, students’ academic and professional ambitions, and their other extracurricular activities stand in the way of full commitment to a band. A resultant wariness permeates Harvard’s student band scene.
“FOR THE CHICKS”
One stop away from the Harvard Square T-stop, near local concert hubs the Middle East and T.T. the Bears, the Harvard undergraduate band Third Rail is conducting their Wednesday night practice. Third Rail is a cover band that plays a wide variety of famous pop tunes—everything from Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” to Katy Perry’s “California Gurls”—though they are hoping to transition to playing their own music sometime next fall. As I sit and watch them play in a building of band practice spaces, smoke and heavy metal hang in the air. Third Rail complains about the perils of being in a student band at Harvard.
“There are plenty of musically talented people at this school, but it takes a lot of energy to make a band,” says Warren S. Loegering ’12, guitarist for Third Rail. “You can’t be a band by yourself.”
“There are six or seven of us, and scheduling is a massive challenge,” adds Samuel R. Berman-Cooper ’12, the band’s bassist who is currently taking a year off from school in order to properly devote himself to Third Rail.
“Speaking of, I can’t do any of those times,” interjects another musician. The whole band erupts into a discussion on their respective schedules.
Indeed, for its musicians, being in Third Rail is the most important in an array of other commitments. From coping with the conflicts of the afterschool tutoring program Keylatch, the a cappella group the Harvard Krokodiloes, lab assistant positions, and other extracurriculars, Third Rail members must perform logistical gymnastics in order to find enough time for practice.
The money they have earned from playing monthly performances at Tommy Doyle’s and other private gigs in Boston-area fraternities, sororities, and Harvard final clubs has enabled them to afford their own space. “We have a lot of equipment and we need to have a place where we can store it. We need to have somewhere to put the gear. This place provides that as well as a place to practice and record,” says Alexander E. Trevino ’12, their drummer. “There are places you can play on campus … I don’t want to sound like I’m whining but they aren’t organized, accessible, or well-maintained. If you leave your stuff in there it might get stolen or broken. It’s a slew of problems. I don’t know exactly how to solve them but they’re there.”
Rising to meet the challenges of orchestrating a student band, however, Third Rail members do demonstrate dedication to playing music. “I can’t imagine myself doing anything else—anything else would be boring,” says Berman-Cooper. “I know music is what I want to do. Regardless of degree, I’ll do music for a few years and try to make it in the music industry.”
Most other members of Third Rail echo Berman-Cooper’s sentiment. Barthalomew A. Sillah ’12, however, a Human Development and Regenerative Biology concentrator, has a different take on the matter. “See, I don’t do the whole starving artist thing like them,” he says. “I like just doing what I do and having a place to perform.” Sillah has doubts about pursuing a career in music.
Nonetheless, Third Rail agrees on certain benefits presented by being in a college band. “Why be in a band?” Loegering asks rhetorically. “Because I love playing music. And obviously for the chicks.”
PICKING UP THE PIECES
Conflicting commitments and schedules, however, deter many Harvard musicians from making bands as cohesive and committed as Third Rail. Even when enough musical ambition abounds to support multiple bands at Harvard, it ebbs and flows with the passing years.
“The problem with all the organizations centered around rock music on campus is that—unlike those tied to classical music groups—they usually live and die on one or two people, one band, etc.,” says Daniel J. Thorn ’11. Thorn is a guitarist for The Sinister Turns, a band composed of one Harvard undergraduate, two graduates, and one other Bostonian that plays gigs around Boston. “The Harvard College Alliance for Rock and Roll (HCARAR) was really good when [its members] were around, and after they graduated, it died.” HCARAR formerly worked to help musicians form bands, find them sound equipment and practice spaces, and organize concerts, though it is no longer active. “There’s kind of a cyclical interest in being in a band on campus,” says Thorn.
Veritas Records, a student-run record label that recorded music in a studio in the Quad and helped students learn how to use their equipment, has a similar history. “Veritas Records would have a battle of the bands at the Queen’s Head back in the day. But when the class of ’07 graduated, people didn’t keep it together,” says Thorn. “They never last. Once that one band graduates no one really knows how to pick up the pieces.”
MAKE US FAMOUS
As an extension to this lack of structural organization, student musicians on campus often seek to play in a band informally. Take the folk-bluegrass band Plump Concord, for example. The band focuses much of their energies on finding creative places in which to perform, rather than creating a fan base or writing their own music. “The most interesting aspect of us performing is that we do a lot of busking,” says Denison. This means playing in outdoor or underground spaces, such as a corridor near Veggie Planet that Denison thinks has particularly good acoustics.
Busking is not all Plump Concord does, however. “We played at Arts First, which was literally the first performance we ever had,” says Denison. “We are doing this [interview] for fame, and we are hoping that you’ll make us famous,” she adds jokingly. In fact, Denison views her band in different terms. “It’s a chance to hang out with friends but also a chance to explore and have fun,” she says.
This nonchalance can draw ire from more seriously aspirational performers. “People will get together and practice for Cultural Rhythms, one battle of the bands, and I wish they had the wherewithal to stick with it,” says Isaac S. Shivvers ’10-’11. Shivvers has played with a number of Harvard bands, including Third Rail, and took time off school to go on tour with a band. He feels that Harvard’s band culture is largely disappointing. “The only limit to the Harvard music scene is the students … More people have to want there to be a music scene,” he says. “More good individual musicians come out of here than good bands.” Even Thorn, who has looked outside the student bubble to find a more serious music group, is not pinning his future to his band. “Even though I don’t plan on making a career on [music], I like taking it as far as I can while keeping my day job,” he says.
KEEP SAYING YES
Far from the Harvard sandbox of standard opportunities, in which success in careers like consulting or finance can come quickly and right after graduation, uncertainty characterizes the future of college bands. “There’s a saying in the music business that you can live off philosophies and creeds but you can’t eat off them,” says Damon H. Krukowski ’85 of Galaxie 500, the seminal slowcore band of the late ’80s and early ’90s that played together at Harvard. For Krukowksi, now an Expository Writing preceptor, success in music was unexpected. “After college, [music] strangely became a profession,” he says of his postgraduate years.
At that time in his life. Krukowski was studying in the Harvard Comparative Literature and English graduate programs. “I never made the decision to pursue a career in music, but it just sort of happened. Our band kept getting bigger and bigger, and we just kept saying yes.” Like members of many student bands today, Krukowski did not expect his passion for music to turn into something much greater.
However, a lot has changed in the Harvard student body since Krukowski’s undergraduate days. He claims that there was less overriding ambition in the student body than there is today. “It was a lot more normal to be without a sense of direction, and the music scene was particularly a concentrated group without direction,” he says. The increasingly professional aspirations of Harvard musicians today are a new problem in fostering successful student groups. “We didn’t really have a sense of what else we could do,” says Krukowski of his generation’s career choices after graduation. “There wasn’t really a network of grants and internships. There was no plan.”
Despite the lack of today’s competitive professional sensibility, Krukowski claims that undergraduate bands still faced significant issues. “[My undergraduate band Speedy and the Castanets] couldn’t get a lot of shows. I think we played every show we could and that wasn’t a lot,” Krukowski says. “There was a battle of the bands every year and one year we entered and came in last. So we were not getting gigs.”
For folk singer David A. Wax ’05—whose band, The David Wax Museum, was recently featured in the New Yorker—time at Harvard was explicitly for academic pursuits outside of his passion for music. After spending two years at Deep Springs College, he says, “I came to value my role as a musician in the community.”  However, he decided to postpone doing music full-time. “I thought that it made more sense to pursue a more academic path for the rest of my undergrad years,” says Wax of his decision to attend Harvard.  “There wasn’t really a happening music scene [at Harvard],” he adds.
For Wax, then, something about the idea of Harvard itself indicated a departure from his talent and passion. “I was so consumed with my academic work that music fell by the wayside at the time,” he says. The victory of academics over music at Harvard is possible even for an aspiring musician with the tenacity and commitment to succeed.
SPARK OF DEVOTION
For those willing to brave disappointment, however, the music scene at Harvard and around Boston can be an enduring resource. After traveling on a 66 bus half-full of hipsters to Allston, I walk down a winding residential street and see a 20-something serenading his skinny-jeaned girlfriend with an acoustic guitar, pass by multiple houses emanating loud music, and push through a cloud of smokers to enter a dimly-lit basement. This is Wadzilla Mansion, an underground music venue that Socrates R. Cruz ’06 and his roommates used to run out of their basement.
The walls of Wadzilla are covered in murals painted by local artists and friends, red lanterns cast an eerie, grungy glow around the venue, and state-of-the-art sound equipment hangs from the ceiling. Cruz’s band Moniker is playing for their Happy Birthday show, in celebration of the one-year anniversary for throwing shows at Wadzilla.
“I’m still academically interested, but—oddly enough—being at Harvard led me to realize my true passion,” says Cruz of his transition from the academic world to the harsh realities of the music business. “I’ve played music all my life. While I was at Harvard I concentrated on other things. I was in the Harvard mariachi group [Mariachi Veritas], but things didn’t come together ’til my senior year with [my band] Major Major. Instead of writing a thesis, I started a band and wrote a lot of music.”
Cruz decided to forgo his interest in research in Latin America after graduation, and instead moved to New York to try to make it as a musician. “New York is dead,” says Cruz, who moved back to the Harvard area after two years. He has been out of college for nearly five years now without taking his music too far outside his basement. However, Moniker does play shows around Boston and is planning to embark on a 20-city tour. The decision may be a timely one; while I was fortunate to have visited Wadzilla on February 12, the venue was shut down on February 16 by the City of Boston due to permit issues.
Cruz, who until recently was in a band with Crimson arts editor Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13, represents something unique in the extended Harvard music scene. That he has left behind academia to pursue his musical dreams demonstrates his commitment to pursuing music as a career. Despite his lack of commercial success thus far, Cruz is sustained by his engagement with music. Watching him play at his own personal venue and interact with artists and fans, it appears clear that he is happy with the choices he has made.
“You have to go out and do things on your own,” says Cruz of succeeding with a band. “You have to create your own opportunities.” Though the Harvard music scene provides its members with opportunities for fun and experimentation, this essential ingredient of serious independent effort is broadly lacking in the music culture here. All it would take to reshape this reality is the spark of devotion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Creating an effective documentary is a decidedly difficult task; one must carefully consider both the story and its intended audience, and along the way, balance the variety of perspectives that comprise the finished product. In 2009, documentary filmmaker Michael Sheridan attempted this complex undertaking, and worked to capture on film the true conditions of war-stricken Afghanistan. To achieve a more realistic representation of the underdeveloped nation, Sheridan trained a group of Afghani students in the art of documentary filmmaking, so that their stories could be told in their own voices.
On February 17, Sheridan visited Harvard to discuss this project in a talk at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). Introducing the filmmaker was Scott Ruescher, Program Coordinator for HGSE’s Arts in Education Program. Ruescher praised Sheridan’s work: “ [it] engages with public stories, challenges the status quo, and attempts to improve lives,” he said. These characteristics certainly describe Sheridan’s work in Afghanistan, which focused on providing locals with a solid education in effective visual storytelling.
When embarking on his journey, Sheridan knew which types of students he most wanted to teach. “I was looking for people who were in careers which already involved telling a story, such as writing, journalism, or broadcasting,” he said. In search of local men and women with diverse perspectives, Sheridan launched a five-week intensive documentary training program with a crew of local experts. “I was the only person not from Afghanistan,” he said, a fact he felt added legitimacy to his endeavor.
To recruit this team of locals, Sheridan, aided by a translator, conducted a series of interviews with Kabul natives. Sheridan was pleasantly surprised with the turnout he received for the interviews, particularly since the development of artistic ideas can be difficult in a society as restrictive as Afghanistan’s. In fact, one individual’s tale of just getting to the interview seemed worthy of a documentary in itself. “There was this one guy who tried to get to us by train and then car, but he encountered a land battle on his way in. He had to return home to rent a motorbike in order to ride over the hills to reach us.” The personal stories that emerged even before the training started underscored for Sheridan the significance and impact of his project.
Yet creating a documentary is never easy, even with a plethora of fascinating stories at one’s disposal. “The five weeks were intense,” said Sheridan, “especially since a number of the men and women had never even turned on a video camera.” The training covered all of the technical knowledge needed to make a documentary, including how to frame, capture, edit, and most importantly, add sound to film. “80% of good storytelling is in the ears,” Sheridan said.
To help his students develop their storytelling abilities, Sheridan devised a set of creative exercises, such as filming people playing cards. “We edited their raw footage together overnight, so they could see how their shots moved together and how what they were filming could be turned into a real story.” The education was meant to empower Sheridan’s students to become better storytellers as the days progressed.
As their skill in crafting cinematic narratives developed, Sheridan encouraged his students to reach out to one particular area of society restricted to him: women. “There would always be a missing subject in any of the films I made—women,” he said. Understanding the need to build strong relationships with other townspeople, the students formed bonds with women in their villages, eventually capturing some of their unique perspectives on film. In this way, Sheridan’s students achieved something that the Western filmmaker could only have dreamed of doing: getting to the heart of the issues that face Afghani people of all backgrounds.
To celebrate the completion of the film collection, Sheridan held a screening in Kabul. “Entertainment is severely limited in Afghanistan, and this event represented a brand new opportunity for many people in the area.” During his talk, Sheridan screened some of the movies, each conveying a compelling perspective on life in Kabul.
The films prompted audience member Julia Van Dyke  to inquire about the possibility of Sheridan attempting similar projects in the future. “Do you see this vision being played out in other countries?” she asked Sheridan. “My mission is to work with the model in other developing places, such as Somalia,” the filmmaker replied. “But when I returned from Afghanistan, I was exhausted just keeping this project going,” he said. Given the scope of Sheridan’s endeavor, a little fatigue is understandable. Documentary filmmaking is, in itself, a challenging task; to combine practical technical education with culturally-meaningful storytelling represents an even more formidable accomplishment.

For most high school seniors, the process of applying to Harvard entails waiting until April 1 for a decision one way or the other. For a select few, however, those months of anxious waiting are cut short by what is called a “likely letter.”
Between Oct. 1 and March 15, Harvard sends out 300 likely letters, which serve as authorized notices of expected admission to “athletes and other exceptional candidates.” In keeping with long-standing practice, the vast majority of this year’s likely letter recipients, approximately two-thirds, were recruited athletes. Although athletic talent certainly deserves recognition in the application process, the current system of likely letters gives preference to one particular subset of the student population to the disadvantage of all the others.
In many ways, using likely letters to provide advanced notice of acceptance is similar to the now-defunct early admissions program. After ending its early admissions policy in 2006, Harvard defended this decision by saying that the move would make the admissions process more egalitarian. If a fairer playing field is truly the College’s goal, likely letters—which privilege a specific pool of applicants over the majority of potential freshmen—seem an incongruous addition to the admissions game. In that sense, the College would do well to evaluate whether the institution of likely letters is truly consistent with its alleged commitment to equal opportunity.
Applicants to the College should not be granted different admissions processes based on the talents they possess. As it stands, the admissions process for recruited athletes has an institutional structure that is not granted to applicants with any other skill set. In screening athletic recruits, Ivy League schools assess students via an average Academic Index, a number calculated from test score performance and high school GPA. The average Academic Index of a school’s athletes must remain within one standard deviation of the student body. The Wall Street Journal postulated in May 2009 that this index, by which all the schools in the Ancient Eight abide, is increasingly hurting Ivy League teams. Comparatively, recruitment at Harvard puts in place sensible guidelines for athletic admissions. However, the fact remains that athletic recruitment is troubling in any sense. Students should be considered on a case-by-case basis, with extracurricular activities playing second fiddle to academic accomplishment in all cases.
Of course, as the directors of athletics and admission administrators of the Ivy League schools are quick to emphasize to prospective student-athletes, “the principles that govern admission of Ivy students who are athletes are the same as for all other Ivy applicants.” Through likely letters, however, Harvard—an academic institution—gives priority to athletic accomplishments when it should instead prioritize academic accomplishments above all else. In its actions and policies, the College should live up to its principles as one of the most preeminent institutions of higher learning in the United States—not as the defending NCAA champion.
In a twist of irony, of all the negative consequences that the institution of likely letters brings to Harvard’s campus, perhaps the most harmful is the resulting stigma toward recruited athletes themselves.
Student-athletes who apply to Harvard and have the credentials to come deserve the same emphasis placed on academic accomplishments as all other students who apply. Being “recruited” rather than “admitted” has connotations that unjustly undermine the intellectual abilities of campus athletes.
Thus, the stigma of having been admitted to a college under different circumstances follows student athletes throughout their time at Harvard and creates a divisive, at times hostile, social environment. Even though recruited athletes must still apply to Harvard with the same materials as regular candidates, the unfortunate perception nevertheless exists that recruits are intellectually inferior and thus undeserving of a place among the student body. To eliminate any basis for these assumptions, the College should stop prioritizing athletes through likely letters and do its part in ending unfounded stereotypes. It should go without saying that college should be an opportunity for individuals to begin with a blank slate and establish their own identities, and Harvard should do its part to ensure that all of its students are afforded that opportunity.
The role of athletics in the College, though undoubtedly important, should never overtake the role of academics in any respect. Since 1650, the College’s charter has advocated “the advancement of all good literature, arts, and sciences.”  By comparison, the oldest intercollegiate athletic rivalry, the Harvard-Yale Regatta, only began in 1852, while the Ivy League—the institution that necessitated athletic recruitment in the first place—did not even enter the picture until 1954. While the College is right to acknowledge its rich athletic tradition, it should not do so at the risk of sacrificing its even richer academic tradition, a legacy that has historically bound all Harvard students, regardless of the sports they play.
With that in mind, the institution of likely letters—if it must be kept—should be revised to give equal weight to a broader range of talented applicants, not just primarily athletes.
Likely letters should be presented to a very small fraction of total applicants who qualify as truly exceptional and should not be run to fill quotas of a specific talent, athletic or otherwise. Used sparingly, likely letters can be a powerful tool for adding talent and diversity to the student body. If applicants are truly exceptional—e.g., gifted students who are the first from their country to apply to Harvard or Olympic athletes with notable academic achievements—a likely letter can indeed play a vital role in encouraging matriculation to Harvard. To follow through with the admirable intention behind ending early admissions, Harvard should emphasize the use of likely letters to attract brilliant students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Above all, likely letters should remain exceptional circumstances for exceptional students, bestowed infrequently and inconsequently of any quota.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago I was buying a couple of textbooks at the Coop. When the sales clerk took out a bag, I instinctively told him I didn’t need one. It occurred to me later that I would not have refused the bag had I made the purchase several months ago. My summer in Washington, D.C., where a five-cent tax is imposed on shopping bags, had conditioned me to do without them.
On Jan. 1, 2010, the tax on plastic and paper bags distributed by District of Columbia retail stores went into effect. The City Council enacted the measure as a way to reduce pollution in Washington’s Anacostia River: A study by the D.C. Department of the Environment found that plastic bags constitute 47 percent of the trash in the river’s tributaries and 21 percent in the river itself. Businesses retain one to two cents of the new fee, and the rest goes to the Anacostia River Cleanup and Protection Fund. Although the tax has been a source of annoyance for residents, it appears to be fulfilling its objective and could serve as a model for pollution control.
The bag tax is properly understood as a Pigouvian tax, the goal of which is to internalize what economists call an “externality” that arises from private consumption. In this case the externality is that many bags end up in the river, which adversely affects the entire community—not just individuals who use them to carry groceries. The purpose of the tax is to adjust the price of bags so it reflects the social cost associated with their consumption.
While this sounds good on paper, Pigouvian taxes are often improperly applied. The amount of the tax should be no more than the amount needed to internalize the externality. And it should be understood primarily as a corrective device—not as a revenue source—meaning the revenue should be rebated or used for a non-mandatory purpose. One recent “Pigouvian” tax that violates both of these principles is the $1.01 increase in the federal cigarette tax in 2009, the amount of which was determined not by the social costs of smoking but by the amount of revenue needed to expand the Children’s Health Insurance Program entitlement.
The D.C. shopping bag tax is more reasonable. American retail has created a culture in which bags are unquestioningly provided free of charge for virtually every purchase, no matter how small, and in which people use new bags for each shopping trip when it would often be easy to save and reuse them.
Council members understood that shopping bags serve a legitimate function. They did not ban plastic bags as San Francisco did in 2007. And they did not adopt a punitively high levy, as in Seattle’s failed attempt to impose a tax of 20 cents per bag. Instead, the city imposed a tax that was just high enough to do the job. A five-cent charge makes customers think twice before requesting a bag for small purchases, and creates an incentive to save bags for reuse on routine shopping outings. On the other hand, such a small price is unlikely to affect personal income, or, despite anecdotal reports to the contrary, to induce people to refuse bags they actually need or shop outside the District to avoid the tax. Part of the revenue compensates retailers for their inconvenience, and the rest is devoted to a discretionary function that will not have to be rescued by the general fund if bag tax revenues decline. A decline in revenues, moreover, would likely be the result of fewer shopping bags, which would reduce the need for river cleanup funding.
While the jury is still out on the tax’s economic impact, it shows early signs of reducing waste. City officials estimate that consumption fell from 270 million bags in 2009 to 55 million in 2010, and retailers are buying only half as many bags. A private environmental group that cleans the Anacostia River says it has collected only a third as many bags in 2010 as in the previous year. Perhaps the most salient criticism of the measure comes from the Washington-based Tax Foundation, which points out that shopping bags are frequently reused for other purposes and that any reduction would be partially offset by more purchases of garbage bags and other plastic bags. No doubt this is true, but it is hard to dispute that the tax has eliminated many shopping bags that would have been discarded, and the increase in other types of bags seems unlikely to incur much inefficiency since it merely replaces retail stores with individual consumers as the buyers of bags.
By far the most dangerous aspect of such a tax is that it could legitimize further environmental initiatives that would be less reasonable. Taken by itself, however, the D.C. shopping bag tax is a modest regulation that appears to be accomplishing its objective. Cities with similar pollution problems would do well to consider Washington’s example.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Discrimination is built into Israel.” Zionism “has at its core the replacement of one people with another.”
These were two claims I heard at a law school panel discussion on “boycotting the Israeli occupation” which was coincidentally held on a Friday evening, when many Jews would be observing the Sabbath through prayer and a family-style meal. As the speakers attempted to ascertain the best practices for attacking and dismantling the State of Israel, I thought back to the four years I spent there before starting law school last fall.
The Israel I experienced differed starkly from the fascist dystopia of which the panelists spoke. That Israel, my Israel, hopes for peace with its neighbors and respects the rights of minority groups, sometimes to a greater extent than the U.S. does.
My military service as a dual citizen gives me great respect for Israel’s deep yearning to co-exist with its Arab neighbors. I served in the Coordinator for Government Activity in the Territories, the Ministry of Defense agency responsible for liaising with the Palestinian Authority, a quasi-sovereign and internationally recognized government entity through which the Palestinian people exercise a great deal of authority over their communities in the West Bank en route to full realization of their national hopes (for which even the conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced his support).
As part of my service, I visited hospitals in Jerusalem where Palestinian children, with Israeli military coordination, receive critical dialysis treatments several times a week (such treatment is unavailable in the West Bank). I saw a Jewish Israeli surgeon, an Apache pilot in the Israel Defense Forces reserves, treat Palestinian, Iraqi, and African children in an intensive care unit. At the crack of dawn I welcomed Palestinian workers to the Israeli community of Qedar outside Jerusalem, where they worked with their Israeli neighbors for much higher wages than they would earn in a Palestinian city.
The upshot here is that Israel doesn’t have to let thousands of Palestinians, many of whom still deny Israel’s basic right to exist, into its communities for medical care or work (as happens every day). But Israel does. These actions, along with Israel’s full, painful withdrawals from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and the Sinai Peninsula in 1982, speak louder than words to Israel’s deep desire to get along with—not replace—its neighbors.
Living in Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv exposed me to a cosmopolitan diversity that would give many world cities a run for their money. Both cities, one renowned for piety and the other for partying, host gay pride parades that run the gamut from uniformed (and sometimes armed) soldiers fresh from an on-base stint to gay and lesbian Arab-Israelis who enjoy a level of freedom unparalleled in the Middle East (homosexuality is a capital crime in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and several other Muslim countries). I saw same-sex couples walking the streets hand in hand, something I rarely see here in liberal Cambridge. Gay Israelis may sponsor their same-sex partners (including Palestinians) for immigration rights, something currently impossible in the U.S.
Arab-Israelis make up about 20 percent of Israel’s population and participate in Israeli democracy at all levels. Justice Salim Joubran, an Arab Christian, sits on the country’s Supreme Court, which has not shied away from confronting other branches of government to advance human rights. Arab men and women continue to vote in elections for and serve in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Out of respect for the complexity of Arab-Israeli identity, Arab citizens are exempt from the compulsory military service that has secured the accomplishments of Israeli democracy.
I know personally that Jews and Arabs in Israel, rather than locking themselves in a self-defeating downward spiral of discrimination and resentment, often come together under the aegis of scholarship. I studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with numerous Arab students who seemed quite content to learn with their Jewish compatriots at the highest-ranked Middle Eastern institution according to international rankings. After a year of study, I went to work for the non-profit Hand in Hand, which runs four bilingual, multicultural schools throughout Israel where Jewish and Arab youth study together in both Hebrew and Arabic (both of which are official languages). Where else in the Middle East would I have heard an Arab adolescent talking about attending his best-friend’s bar-mitzvah—and understanding the Hebrew far better than most American Jews?
As a young democracy that recently celebrated its 60th birthday, Israel is not perfect. Many agree that Israel should play a greater role in helping Palestinian national aspirations find their proper realization. But obfuscating basic truths about Israel’s diverse society and longstanding desire for peace is counterproductive and will only serve to inflame an already polarized discourse.

Soccer is hip. Soccer is chic. Soccer is it—the perfect complement to that novella you penned with your MacBook Pro while sipping a fair trade latte at your local not-Starbucks. Liking soccer is yet another sure sign of your cosmopolitan good taste in the midst of an utterly ignorant America.
Unfortunately, soccer is dull. Soccer is stodgy. Soccer is a huge, boring, stupid mess—all positions I’ve resolutely maintained since recess ended on the last day of fifth grade. It’s fun to play, silly to watch.
But in 2006, talking heads on television started quietly insisting that soccer was the next big thing in American sports. By last summer they were screaming (and in 3-D HD, no less) that with this next World Cup thing, soccer would explode into a money-making machine the way real football did in the 60s and 70s. Sporting super-corporations like Nike, Disney, and mega-brewer ABInBev were investing millions to ensure this.
I wasn’t looking forward to being blinded by the vanity-driven me-tooism that was hurtling my way, but how could I not get excited to see America win? Maybe I’d be swept up yet.
Lucky for me, America didn’t win much, and soccer has since stayed dead as ever on these shores. FIFA’s hapless tournament did a great job showcasing all the things that make soccer unexciting. Millions of first-time fans with high expectations were greeted instead by a tournament where skill and fact took a back seat to luck and referee guesswork. I watched six hours of footage to see two “ties,” two obviously legal—yet absurdly unreviewable—disallowed goals, and an embarrassing loss to a country that’s a tenth our size. Again.
There was, of course, Landon Donovan’s last second heroic goal, but investing in five hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds of sheer nothingness for that one moment makes for, in retrospect, a pretty sad story. If I wanted to actually be entertained by sports drama last summer, I could have instead focused on Ray Allen shooting a record-setting seven for seven three-pointers in the first half of Game 2 but still losing the National Basketball Association Finals, or a post-philandering Mr. Woods hitting a 66 on Day 3 of the U.S. Open only to finish third in his quest for an epic comeback.
But that’s just the problem with soccer, and the reason it will never hold a candle to established professional sports in America. It’s those few epic plays or nail-biting moments of desperate faith and possibility spread throughout an entire game that make watching sports worth it—even losses. There’s always something in it for everyone; in soccer, there’s often nothing in it for anyone. A “nil-nil” result is a very real possibility, and every time even a superstar fires a shot, the expectation is that it goes 10 yards left of goal. Or is that meters?
It surely is intriguing that billions of foreign people see fit to live and die by this game alone. But frankly, we aren’t missing out on anything. Our D.A.R.E. officers taught us that just because everyone’s doing it doesn’t mean it’s cool. Nothing happens, the rules are subjective, the referees have too much power, and in the name of European traditions or anti-commercialization, the sport refuses to evolve. Americans by nature don’t take very kindly to any of those ideas.
One of the sports’ few merits is that anyone from the poorest peasant on up can play it on the cheap. Other than the ball, there are no pads or equipment to buy and no fields or courts to build. Lines in the dirt will do just fine for goals. But in a land where generations of deep pockets and a love of entertainment and competition have built up a sports infrastructure, culture, and market rivaled by no others, we don’t have to settle for boring old soccer, America’s already several leagues ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite low satisfaction ratings among recent graduates of the concentration, interest in engineering sciences at Harvard continues to grow.
Statistics from the Harvard College Admissions Office showed a 68 percent increase over four years in the number of high school applicants expressing interest in the field.
According to the Admissions Office, 4,305 applicants in the class of 2014 expressed interest in studying engineering sciences compared to 2,560 applicants from the class of 2011. During this period, the number of students who matriculated after being admitted for engineering rose by 46 percent.
This trend has been consistent since the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences became its own school in 2007.
“The numbers have really jumped up within the past year,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said. “What’s happening with the new school is it has given much greater visibility to what we’re doing,” he said. “The word is out.”
SEAS is trying to maximize this visibility by reaching out to potential applicants through new avenues—especially the web, according to SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie D. Dahleh.
“[We] changed the website, invested heavily in the web presence,” she said.
Dahleh also said that developing a more hands-on curriculum—through undergraduate laboratories and project-based courses—has generated “a lot of excitement about doing engineering.”
“High profile” courses such as Science and Cooking, which was first offered this fall as a Science of the Physical Universe Gen Ed course, and CS50, a popular introductory computer science class, have also drawn attention to engineering at Harvard, Dahleh added, garnering press on campus and beyond.
While she said that it is “not always obvious” that Harvard is a strong engineering school, that image is quickly changing. SEAS introduced a new concentration—Biomedical Engineering—this fall and is currently in the process of hiring assistant deans of undergraduate studies to bolster the advising system in the engineering department.
And many high school seniors do not indicate an interest in engineering on their applications but switch to the field once arriving on campus, according to Fitzsimmons.
“Computer science and mathematics students are sometimes fungible,” he said. “Once people get here there are often those who might change their minds and end up in engineering.”
But Dahleh also said that growth in engineering at Harvard is not necessarily unique.
“Historically, engineering is a bit of a cyclic concentration,” she said. “Across the country, engineering enrollment is up.”
Current engineering science concentrators are not surprised at the jump in applicant numbers. “I really feel there’s a push for engineering,” said William C. Burke ’13. “My guess is that in ten years, Harvard engineering is going to be the best in the country.”

Tomato-lovers will soon be at a loss in their dining halls as they search for wedges of soon-to-be-gone fresh tomatoes in the salad bars.
Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services decided to remove fresh tomatoes from the menus due to severe winter temperatures that have affected tomato quality and availability, said HUHDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
“The small supply of tomatoes at an acceptable quality is cost prohibitive,” she said, citing the 250 percent increase in the price of tomatoes this season.
The dining halls will serve the tomatoes that remain in stock but will not be purchasing additional batches.
Though fresh tomatoes will be missing from salad, sandwich, and taco bars, students will see very slight changes in the menu, Martin said. She did not know when the tomatoes will return.
“We’ll continue to monitor quality and return tomatoes to the menu as soon as the quality is up to our standards,” Martin said.
For the majority of the year, HUHDS buys its tomatoes from Backyard Farms, a 42-acre tomato growing facility in Madison, Maine. During the winter, HUHDS gets them from farms in California and Florida to meet demand at Harvard.
This year, however, freezing temperatures in Florida not only limited the availability of tomatoes but also affected their quality.
Tomato disappearances are not new to Harvard. In 2004, HUHDS removed tomatoes from the salad bar for two months for the same reason when a crop famine in the winter caused the price to skyrocket and the quality to drop.
Joel A. Rojo ’11, a Quincy House resident eating in Adams, said he eats tomatoes every day, either with his salad or as a side.
“Tomatoes add redness to my green salad,” Joel A. Rojo ’11 said as he stuck his fork into a slice of tomato from his plate of green spinach.
Rojo said he agreed with HUHDS’ decision to remove them from the salad bar since they are both expensive and poor in quality, a sentiment echoed by Leverett House resident Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12.
“I wouldn’t want to eat plain tomatoes if they tasted bad,” she said.
Moroney, who said she mostly sticks to salads with greens and beans, said the dining halls should present alternatives to tomatoes.
No other produce was affected by the weather.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of a group critical of final clubs presented its statement of purpose at last night’s Undergraduate Council meeting in the hopes of spurring discussion among UC members about the funding and availability of alternative social spaces.
According to the statement, the campaign is alarmed by what it characterizes as the discriminatory nature of Harvard’s social landscape and believes that social space on campus should be more inclusive and accessible.
In addition, the campaign seeks to provide undergraduate students with more information concerning final clubs. It also encourages the administration to be more transparent in terms of its stance on final clubs, as well as the actions it is taking to create safe, more inclusive alternatives.
“We are not an anti-final club campaign,” said Camille S. Owens ’13, a member of the campaign’s leadership team, who presented the statement at the UC meeting. “We have come to realize there are much deeper problems.”
“Final clubs are a part of this,” added Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, another member of the leadership team, “but at the end of the day, it is really about the fact that Harvard students don’t have enough space to socialize.”
In order to address this problem, the campaign proposed a number of measures that will require coordination across all realms of campus life.
Collaboration with the UC is already underway.
“We know that the UC does a lot of work around social space,” Owens said. “So we just want to talk about funding for student-initiated parties and opening up other spaces.”
UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 commended the work of the campaign, saying that it “has really made some waves on campus over the past semester.”
“I thought it would be important for members of the Council, who care about the well-being of the campus, to hear from them because the work they are doing to institutionalize the campaign is crucial,” he said.
According to Owens, members of the campaign have also been busy establishing relationships with House Masters and discussing alternative spaces they would potentially be willing to open up.
Collaboration with the College administration has also been a crucial aspect for the campaign as they push forward. According to Owens, members of the campaign met with Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson several times last semester to discuss the issue and potential solutions.
“In the end, what we have realized is that there is common ground on this issue,” Owens said. “In a lot of ways, we have so much in common with final clubs, and they share similar sentiments that there is not enough social space or alternatives available to students.”
Berkenfeld added that, as the campaign moves forward, members have been working to institutionalize the campaign.
“Time and time again, a similar movement will rise and then fade out,” he said. “We want to institutionalize this campaign so that it doesn’t disappear when we graduate.”

Harvard workers want increases in health care coverage, according to an open letter released by the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers on Feb. 14.
The letter outlines HUCTW’s goals for upcoming negotiations with the University, including increases in health care coverage, more worker involvement in councils involved in staffing decisions, and a reevaluation of Harvard’s adherence to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which outlines acceptable exemptions from overtime pay.
The previous agreement between HUCTW and the University was made in June and covered only a two-year period, a decision based partly on the University’s strapped financial situation at the time of the negotiations. At the time, the union and University disagreed about the likelihood that the University’s financial situation would continue to improve.
Health care was a prominent concern in the letter, despite the recent passage of President Obama’s health care bill that seeks to provide coverage to all Americans.
“The bill is more meaningful to people who are only marginally covered,” said HUCTW director Bill Jaeger.
Jaeger said the most important aspect of any health care plan for union workers is eliminating co-payments on preventative visits. “The challenge for our union is the problem of brutally increasing health care costs,” Jaeger said.
Jaeger said that union members are not yet at their crisis point in terms of health care costs, but they are “not inclined to sit around and wait.”
HUCTW is also seeking increased accessibility to Joint Councils, groups which allow HUCTW members to be represented in the decision-making process in their divisions.
The availability of Joint Councils was stipulated in the June agreement between HUCTW and the University.
The recent letter calls Joint Councils a “cornerstone” of the HUCTW-Harvard partnership, emphasizing the importance of union members having their voices heard during periods of department reorganization.
The letter also addresses Harvard’s adherence to the Fair Labor Standards Act, and Jaeger said that HUCTW is determined to make sure workers are classified accurately, which will help ensure they receive correct overtime pay.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin declined to comment for this article.

After a large number of rushes this spring, the three Harvard fraternities extended an unusually high number of bids to potential members.
One hundred men signed up during Sigma Chi’s rush process, among whom 18 were invited to become pledges last Thursday, according to pledges of the fraternity.
AEPi President John C. Hill ’12 said his fraternity extended 14 bids this spring, adding that the number represented “a huge increase from last year and years past.”
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has an apartment on Harvard Street, extended 11 bids last Friday, and all were accepted, according to SAE President Phillip J. Morris ’12.
The large number of fraternity pledges follows a record number of girls who rushed and joined sororities earlier in the year.
Wesley G. Brown ’14, who received a bid from Sigma Chi, said the sense of community drew him to the organization.
“Primarily, I just wanted to have other social opportunities and meet some upperclassmen,” Brown said.
Pledges said they were attracted to the social aspect of the fraternities.
“Fraternity is more focused on the people, whereas the extra-curriculars are more about the interest,” said Steve P. Murphy ’13, a recent Sigma Chi pledge.
After accepting a bid from fraternities, the rushes become pledges and go through an extensive pledge process.
Sigma Chi’s process lasts around 8 weeks, according to Tony Huang ’12, consul of Sigma Chi, which has a house on Mass. Ave.
“This is almost a whole-semester process that allows the new guys to learn about the history of our fraternity—both our chapter and our national organization—and to bond with each other, and to create a sense of brotherhood among our pledge class,” Huang said.
Similar to sororities’ “big sister” program, each pledge will receive a “big brother”.
“The big brother guides the pledge through the pledgeship process and helps him in every single way,” Huang said.
“The pledge process is meant to create a sense of camaraderie among the pledges and brothers, as well as educate and prepare the pledges for brotherhood,” Huang said.
Morris declined to elaborate on the pledge process for SAE, but he said the fraternity does not haze its new members.
“It’s a basic process to teach them about the history of our chapter,” he said, “and give the pledge class a chance to get to know each other better.”

As talk of blocking and rooming fill Annenberg, the upperclass houses are rolling out the red carpet in anticipation of Housing Day on March 10.
Currier, Dunster, Leverett, Quincy, and Pforzheimer House Committees have already released videos or teaser trailers proclaiming the superiority of their respective houses.
Dunster released a video last week spoofing the Golden Globe Best Picture, ‘The Social Network’, and Leverett made a teaser trailer called “I Just Got Lev,” based off of the Saturday Night Live skit “I Just Had Sex.”
Pforzheimer released the video “Double Dining Hall” based on the YouTube clip “Double Rainbow.”
Quincy produced “Quinception,” a video based off of the movie ‘Inception.’
“We wanted something culturally relevant and epic that the freshmen could see,” co-creator and Quincy resident Michael Ardeljan ’13 said. “We want to be on freshmen’s radar with our great community, great masters, tutors, and students. We are the people’s house.”
Currier, which also has a video in the works spoofing ‘Inception’, released a teaser on Sunday mocking Quincy’s rendition.
In Currier’s response to the Quinception video, residents say, “You can’t expect penguins to know how to fly properly”—referring to the Qunicy House Mascot—and “Quincy suffers from pre-conception.”
Other House Committees have decided that they will not release their movies until housing day. Lowell House is still producing their movie, which will be based on a song that remains secret.
“We are hoping that the song, which is the background to our movie, becomes a sort of Lowell anthem or party favorite,” Lowell House Committee Co-Chair Margaret E. Soutter ’12 said.
The House Committees are also keeping their T-shirt designs under wraps, though controversy has erupted on Leverett’s open e-mail list about a potential design featuring the Playboy bunny.
In response, the Leverett House Committee pulled the design from the voting pool yesterday.
Traditions on Housing Day vary widely among houses. Adams House Committee Co-Chair Annie G. Douglas ’12 relates, “coming to your door in full formal wear with wax sealed invitations to our reception with roses, cigars, and champagne.”
Leverett House Committee Co-Chair Lavinia R. Mitroi ’12 tells of the Leverett “army storming the yard wearing camouflage and bunny ears.”
No matter what the outcome, housing day is “the best day of the year,” Quincy House Committee Co-Chair Neil T. Curran ’12 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Our people are dying,” said a young woman waving the Libyan flag to a passerby in Harvard Square yesterday. “Save Libya!”
The protester was among one hundred people gathered at Harvard Square yesterday from around 1 to 5 p.m. to demonstrate against Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi’s 40-year regime and his recent use of violence against protesters in Libya.
Over the past week, massive demonstrations have erupted throughout Libya calling for an end to Gaddafi’s 40-year term in office, with multiple reports of violence against the protesters.
On Sunday, Libyan security forces opened fire on a funeral procession in Benghazi, Libya’s second largest-city and currently under the control of the demonstrators.
The Harvard Square protesters said the demonstration developed quickly from conversations the previous day.
“We don’t know exactly how it started,” said B. Bayou, a Northbridge resident from Libya. “A couple of people gathered at the Yusuf Mosque in Brighton [on Sunday] and we decided to protest today. It really grew. Libyans are here from all over.”
The protestors called for the U.S to support Gaddafi’s removal from power.
“Our people are being killed,” said Soad Utones, a Mass. resident from Libya who was at yesterday’s protest. “[Obama] has to do something. He knows people are being killed. We don’t know why he doesn’t act,” she said.
Yesterday, Libya’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations Ibrahim O. Dabbashi led a formal repudiation of Gaddafi at the Libyan Mission to the UN headquarters in New York, declaring him a genocidal war criminal responsible for the mass deaths of demonstrators in Libya.
The same day, Gaddafi’s security forces retreated to select buildings in Tripoli and continued to clash with protestors. According to the Human Rights Watch, the death toll in Libya has reached 233, though local media outlets have reported over 200 deaths in Benghazi alone.
Organizing through social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, thousands of protesters have engaged in both violent and non-violent demonstrations across the nation, often clashing with Libyan military and police officers.
Possibly following the example of neighboring Egypt, the Libyan government has severely restricted internet access in the country and limited access into and out of the country.
The Obama administration has issued a statement openly condemning the violence in Libya.
Protesters in Harvard Square said they were hoping for a repeat demonstration later in the week.
“We are Libyans,” Utones said. “We care about our country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With plans for Harvard’s House renewal project in development, administrators have said that heating, air conditioning, ventilation, and accessibility will all likely be included in the renovation.
In 2009, the House Program Planning Committee released a report detailing a number of recommendations for the renovations, including the introduction of more social spaces and the elimination of large group hallway bathrooms.
In the report, the committee acknowledged but did not emphasize that undergraduates would rather “control their own heat” and that they would prefer that the “renovations allow for more environmentally friendly heating and cooling.”
Recently, Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators familiar with the renewal plans confirmed that renovations to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units will likely be folded into the larger renewal plan.
“We’re seriously looking into the development of [heating, ventilation, and air conditioning] improvements in the houses,” said one administrator in the FAS Office of Physical Resources and Planning who requested anonymity to preserve relations with the administration. “The current systems are outdated, and this is only one step towards making these Houses up to date.”
They also said that they believed the cost of implementing the renovations will equal or exceed 15 percent of the Houses’ real estate values, necessitating an increase in accessibility for disabled members of the community according to the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The Massachusetts Architectural Access Board requires that Harvard provide “basic access,” meaning that five percent of suites, bedrooms, and supporting bathrooms be accessible,” according to the 2009 report.
The report also says that the College hopes to make nearly 100 percent of suites and shared residential common rooms accessible to a person in a wheel chair.
In an e-mailed statement yesterday, FAS Spokesperson Jeff Neal confirmed that accessibility is being considered when drafting plans for Houses.
“The physical renovation of any House structure will necessarily involve making the building [American Disabilities Act] compliant and [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] certified,” Neal wrote.
Announced over two years ago, House renewal is an ambitious project to renovate the structure of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced in January that Old Quincy will be the first of the Houses to undergo construction.
The renovations to Old Quincy, slated to begin shortly after commencement in 2012, will allow planners to confront the design and construction issues they may face when renovating other Houses, according to a January press release.
Although the renovation plans for Quincy have not yet been finalized, Neal said that he expects the administration to release specifics to the Harvard community in May.
In January, Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke wrote in an e-mail that the College would follow the guidelines that the HPPC outlined in the report, including improved accessibility for handicapped students. He said that increased privacy for students, better safety measures, and upgraded sustainability and energy conservation efforts would also be priorities.
“If these guidelines were applied to Old Quincy, it would mean that there would no longer be students living in common rooms, and there would be no walk-through bedrooms,” he wrote.
Walk-through bedrooms, which are common in Old Quincy, require students to walk through their roommate’s bedroom to reach the bathroom.
Plans for Old Quincy will likely be finalized in the next few months in preparation for the House renewal project’s 2012 start date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Harvard undergraduates and a Harvard Medical School student are among the 30 American recipients of the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, the organization announced recently.
Seniors Sherry Gong ’11, Johnny H. Hu ’11, and Katherine E. Pickard ’11 and a second-year HMS student—selected from an initial field of around 800 applicants and an interview shortlist of 80—will have the opportunity to pursue master’s or PhD degrees at the University of Cambridge in England under the financial auspices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to the official press release.
The HMS student has declined the scholarship and asked that his name not be printed.
For Hu, a chemical and physical biology concentrator, the trip to Cambridge represents a triumphant homecoming. Born in China, Hu moved to England when he was five and spent five years there before settling in Huntsville, Alabama.
“I really loved my time in England, and I’ve always been excited about going back,” he said. “Hopefully by the time I get back to the US, I’ll have a British accent.”
At Cambridge, the Cabot House resident and mentor for the Harvard-Allston Education Portal will pursue a master’s degree in the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, specifically examining the response of neurons to external guidance. He hopes to eventually become a researcher in neurological diseases.
“When I talked to the other interviewees, there were a lot of really intelligent and thoughtful people who were doing great things,” Hu said. “It’s a very humbling experience for me to be selected.”
Gong, one of Fifteen Minutes’ 15 Most Interesting Seniors this year, was born in N.Y. to a family of math professors, but grew up in Toronto, Puerto Rico, and New Hampshire. This year she received the Alice T. Schafer Mathematics Prize for the top female math student in the country. At Cambridge, she will pursue a M.Sc. in pure math.
Pickard, a psychology concentrator with a special interest in the study of children with psychological disabilities, will study toward an M.Phil. in social and developmental psychology.
At Harvard, the Phoenix, Ariz. native and Eliot House resident is a varsity swimmer and co-founder of Project SWIM, a club that teaches children with autism and Down syndrome how to swim.
“It’s not as hard as it seems,” Picker said of juggling her activities and classes.
Beyond her one-year master’s program at Cambridge, the record-holding athlete may pursue a doctorate in clinical psychology. Pickard eventually plans to devote her research to the early intervention and diagnosis of autism, she said.
“It’s nice to know what I’ll be doing next year,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In mid-October, when ambitious high school seniors are still anxiously toiling away at their Harvard College application, a select few already have received word of their likely acceptance.
The summer before his senior year in high school, Nick Saathoff, a star baseball player at Apache Junction High School in Arizona, got the first of many phone calls from Harvard coaches. Before they reached out to him, Harvard was not even on his radar, he said.
“It was weird for me because I didn’t think I could get in when they first called me,” he said.
From there, coaches helped guide him through the admissions process, recommending he retake the SAT Reasoning Test and the ACT, and take the appropriate SAT Subject Tests.
In the fall, Harvard flew Saathoff to Cambridge, where he met with coaches and the baseball team.
And then, five days after he submitted his application on Nov. 5, he received the coveted “likely letter,” which guarantees all but certain admission to the College.
At colleges and universities outside the Ivy League, many schools have the power to offer athletic scholarships and official early acceptances to entice promising athletes to enroll at their school. But, because Harvard lacks these options, likely letters play a crucial role in some athletes’ college admissions process.
The Recruiting Process
Every year, a group of approximately 200 recruited athletes are offered “likely letters” between Oct. 1 and March 15. While these letters technically do not guarantee an applicant admission to the College, admissions experts agree that a student who receives such a letter would only be denied admission in the most extreme circumstances.
“Barring a severe drop in grade, you can expect to get an offer,” said Penny Deck, an independent college counselor in Virginia.
While the exact timeline for the recruiting process varies by sport, Harvard coaches say that they make their first contact the summer before a prospective athlete’s senior year of high school.
From there, it is a hurried process where coaches evaluate a potential player in everything from athletic ability to character so that they can determine who they want to join their team.
While Harvard wrestling coach Jay Weiss said that different coaches place different levels of importance on these visits, he said it is crucial for his team’s prospects.
“We find out a lot about them,” he said. “We see what their goals are, athletically and academically, to see if they match [what we’re looking for].”
The Letter
Beginning on Oct. 1, Harvard and its Ivy League counterparts can begin issuing likely letters to any of their applicants. While these letters are given to students for a variety of reasons, recruited athletes receive the majority early on in this period.
At Harvard and its Ivy peers, these letters are especially important.
Dave Galehouse, co-author of a guide for high school recruits titled “The Making of a Student Athlete”, said that Ivies are at a disadvantage because they do not offer special binding admissions decisions to student athletes.
According to Galehouse, the athletic programs at many other Division I institutions can essentially guarantee a student’s acceptance at their schools. He said he believes likely letters are a way to compensate for that disadvantage.
“It’s challenging for [Ivy League schools] because other schools can give notice earlier than we can,” said Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris.
Since the elimination of early action, Harvard has lost another tool to assure athletes—many of whom receive time-sensitive offers from other schools—that Harvard will admit them.
“Now that we don’t have our early action program, it’s very important to have likely letters,” said Harvard women’s volleyball coach Jennifer Weiss. “We’re still competing against schools that [do].”
“People are making decisions early. They can’t hold out a decision from Harvard until April,” said Weiss, the wrestling coach.
The Commitment Question
The Ivy League has minimal rules governing how its member institutions can utilize the likely letter, according to Harris. Still, the rules that exist are clear. While coaches may inquire as to a student’s level of interest, they cannot require a commitment or suggest that the applicant’s admission be contingent upon a commitment, according to the league’s website.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that Harvard not only follows the rule, but takes the principle one step further.
“We don’t really ask them or inquire [whether they plan on coming]. It’s not an issue,” he said. “To have a likely be binding would be antithetical to our admissions philosophy.”
Despite acknowledging the Ivy League policy of not requiring a commitment, Galehouse said that coaches do gauge interest levels before submitting their preferences to the admissions office.
“If coaches are going to go to bat for you, they want a pretty strong commitment,” he said of his understanding of the process in the Ivies. “You’re not really supposed to be going after likely letters from multiple schools. Coaches talk.”
Fitzsimmons acknowledged that few recruited athletes who receive likely letters from Harvard end up attending other institutions.
“A pretty high percentage of the athletes end up coming,” he said, adding that the trend can be attributed to a bond that recruits feel to the coach or the institution, not because Harvard requires any sort of commitment.
“It’s up to them whether they keep their applications in elsewhere,” Fitzsimmons said. “We’ve certainly had athletes who received likelies who end up not coming.”
Saathoff, who said he plans to matriculate at Harvard, said that while Harvard’s baseball coaches made it clear that they wanted him to join the team and made efforts to make the process as smooth as possible for him, they did not ask him to commit.
According to Saathoff, this procedure stands in contrast to the processes at two other schools he had considered attending: New Mexico State University and St. Mary’s College of California.
“They understood the situation, but they were still putting pressure on me,” Saathoff said of the other college. “It came down to the wire.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 2010-2011 season, the third time was unfortunately not the charm for the Harvard women’s squash team.
After losing narrowly to Yale in pre- and regular-season matchups, the Crimson thought it was ready to face the Bulldogs again in the CSA Team Championship final and come away with the Howe Cup. Harvard (11-2, 5-1 Ivy) instead experienced another heartbreaking 5-4 loss on Sunday, failing to defend its CSA title from last year. With that, the Bulldogs (17-0, 6-0) end their undefeated season with the Ancient Eight title and CSA team trophy.
NO. 1 YALE 5, NO. 2 HARVARD 4
Yale reached the final match of the Howe Cup tournament in a similar fashion as the Crimson—the Bulldogs beat No. 8 Dartmouth, 9-0, and then No. 5 Princeton, 6-3
But the match between the top-two squads in the nation was much closer.
“It came down to the last match again,” said captain No. 13 Alisha Mashruwala. “It was a very sad loss because everyone fought so hard and played with so much heart.”
After the first rotation of senior Alexandra Zindman, junior No. 37 Cece Cortes, and Mashruwala came off the court, Harvard was down, 2-1, with the only win coming from a four-frame battle between Cortes and sophomore No. 46 Katie Ballaine.
The next rotation saw senior No. 29 Bethan Williams, junior No. 7 Nirasha Guruge, and sophomore No. 17 Natasha Kingshott take the court.
“Kingshott lost in a heartbreaking 3-2 match,” Cortes said. “She came back from being down 2-1 to tie it, but the other player was very fit and on today … It was a lot closer than the match score makes it out to be.”
Down 4-2, the Crimson had three matches left to seal the win.
No. 1 sophomore Laura Gemmell and No. 42 sophomore Sarah Mumanachit upped the ante when they knotted the match at four apiece; the championship then rested squarely on the shoulders of senior No. 9 June Tiong.
“[Tiong] played a beautiful game,” Cortes said. “She’s one of the most beautiful players to watch—she’s great tactically.”
It was a 13-11 tiebreaker in the fourth frame that finally handed the Bulldogs the Howe Cup.
“At the end of the day, someone had to win, and that unfortunately wasn’t us,” Mashruwala said.
HARVARD 6, NO. 3 TRINITY 3
No. 2 Pamela Hathway and Wee Nee Low eked out impressive five-set victories for the Bantams, but their efforts were not enough to carry the Bantams (14-3, 5-0 NESCAC) through the semifinal round of the CSA tournament.
“Trinity, I would say, was a much greater test [this time] than when we played them last week,” Cortes said. “They came out really strong … I think that it says a lot about our team that we were able to pull off a 6-3 win.”
Part of that victory was no doubt the resilience of the Harvard squad. After falling just short of victory in her first two sets, Kingshott turned things around at the No. 5 spot. Dominating the next three frames, the Connecticut native dropped her No. 55 opponent Emery Holton, 11-9, 11-8, 11-5, 11-2, 11-3.
Playing just below Kingshott in the sixth position, Cortes also put on an impressive performance. Cortes swapped sets with her competition, No. 33 Alicia Rodriguez, to push a fifth frame.
But the pressure did little to slow down the native Cantabrigian—she snagged the final set to claim victory, 11-13, 11-8, 11-9, 11-3, 11-5.
“The match against Trinity was very close this time,” Mashruwala said. “Every single one of the girls played very well to get the win.”
Mashruwala, Gemmell, Mumanachit, and Williams also chipped in to ensure Harvard’s ticket to the championship match.
HARVARD 9, NO. 7 CORNELL 0
The Crimson came out firing for its first match of the tournament, quickly dispatching the Big Red (5-7, 2-4) and knocking its Ivy foe out of contention for the Howe Cup. Eight of the nine Harvard athletes won in dominant fashion, blanking their opponents in straight sets.
“The match [against Cornell] was a great way for us to settle into the tournament this weekend,” Cortes said. “We got out a bunch of kinks that we had ... Overall, we played solidly.”
The biggest battle of the day unfolded during the No. 3 match between Mashruwala and No. 26 Jesse Pacheco, who during the regular season played at the top against Gemmell. After dropping close first and fourth sets, Mashruwala regained momentum and pulled out the win, 11-8, 11-7, 11-9, 11-8, 11-6.
“Cornell played very well,” Mashruwala said. “They had nothing to lose—all of them went out there and gave their best. It was important for our girls to be composed, [and] they were.”
Gemmell, at No. 1, faced off against 16th-ranked Jaime Laird, while at No. 2, Guruge faced her teammate’s sister, captain No. 35 Jennifer Gemmell. The Crimson’s Gemmell and Guruge claimed victory without dropping a frame.
Tiong and Kingshott, in the fourth and fifth slots, beat their competition by identical scores of 11-7, 11-0, 11-6.
Cortes, Mumanachit, Williams, and sophomore No. 51 Vidya Rajan also nabbed straight-set victories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—A squad vaunted for its ability to rain down three pointers and set up highlight reel dunks, Harvard relied on neither weapon against Columbia Saturday night. Instead it was primarily the team’s stingy defense that propelled the Crimson to a 61-42 victory over the Lions in front of a crowd of 2,616 at Levien Gymnasium.
Harvard set the tone from the opening tip, picking up a block on Columbia’s first offensive possession of the night and going on to hold its hosts to just five points in the game’s first 10 minutes. Whether on open looks or closely contested opportunities, the Lions had little luck from the field, where they converted just one of their first 14 field goal attempts during the opening half and only one three pointer on the night.
The most critical defensive task for the Crimson was handling its opponent’s perimeter leaders: junior Noruwa Agho—the Ivy League’s top scorer—and sophomore Brian Barbour.
The pair attacked in a number of ways, coming off screens to either pull up for floaters or go up at the hoop, not to mention posting up down low. While Barbour’s speed and Agho’s athleticism allowed each to create space to work, Harvard recovered on the interior to challenge shots and prevent easy finishes.
Add on to that a generally cold shooting night for both, and by game’s end the two had combined for 15 points—about half of their combined average of 29—and missed 14 of the 18 shots they took from the field.
“One thing we talked about was trying to stay in front without fouling,” sophomore guard Brandyn Curry said. “They wanted to get in the lane; they’re crafty with the dribble...they also get to the free throw line a lot.”
Given the assignment of defending Agho was sophomore wing Christian Webster, who was helped by physical rookies Laurent Rivard and Matt Brown off the bench.
Coming in averaging 14 points a game—good for sixth in the league—Webster’s efforts on the defense may have taken a toll on his play on the other end of the floor, as he came away with zero points for just the second time in his collegiate career. His work did not go unnoticed, though.
“I thought Christian Webster, in particular, sacrificed a lot offensively for us, to give of himself, to guard [Agho],” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s a very, very difficult kid to guard. … He can shoot it off the catch; he’s strong; he can put it down and get to the mid-range.”
GETTING BOARD
A direct result of Columbia’s poor shooting was Harvard’s tremendous rebounding advantage. Despite the fact that Columbia had entered Saturday’s matchup No. 39 in the country in rebounding margin—leading opponents by an average of 4.7 per game—the Crimson dominated its league rival on the glass, picking up 36 to Columbia’s 18.
The performance represented a turnaround from the previous night’s contest at Cornell, when the Harvard was out-rebounded, 32-29, and gave up 15 offensive boards to a Big Red team boasting modest interior talent.
“We weren’t pleased with our effort on the glass [against Cornell],” Amaker said. “If we were going to have a chance to play well and to win this evening, we needed to hold our ground on the glass.”
Sophomore Kyle Casey and junior co-captain Keith Wright led the renewed charge, combining for 21 rebounds—three more than the opposing team’s total. In the process, Wright picked up his 11th double-double of the year.
The Crimson frontcourt’s stellar night was aided by the absence of two Columbia big men, Mark Cisco and John Daniels, who each missed the game due to injury. Cisco had fallen hard on his knee and head the night before against Dartmouth.
OVERTURNED
While Harvard’s offensive balance was on full display—four Crimson starters reached double digits—also apparent was a problem that has haunted the team all year: turnovers.
A tenacious Columbia defense forced nine Harvard turnovers in the first half, leading to the only easy buckets for the home squad all night.
Apart from the usual assortment of traveling violations and offensive fouls, the Crimson also mishandled passes and made dangerous forays into traffic, mistakes that allowed the Lions to remain in contention throughout the first half.
After a long three by junior co-captain Oliver McNally gave Harvard a 13-point lead with 2:19 remaining, three consecutive Crimson turnovers paved the way for Columbia to head into halftime trailing by nine.
All in all, a night after coughing it up only 10 times against the Big Red, Harvard gave it away 15 times, which led to 13 Lions points.
“You give them credit,” Amaker said. “They scrapped and clawed, and they played hard, and they knocked it off of us. They made us turn it over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Presidents’ Day weekend was all business for the Harvard women’s tennis team as it traveled to Princeton, N.J., to compete in the ECAC Indoor Championships.
The No. 55 Crimson finished in the top half of the eight-team field—seven of which came from the Ivy League, and played three matches in as many days. After defeating Cornell, 6-1, in its opening match on Friday, third-seeded Harvard fell to No. 40 Yale, 6-1, in Saturday’s semifinals. The Crimson secured its fourth-place finish in the tournament with a 4-1 loss to Brown Sunday.
“Overall, we did a pretty solid job,” junior co-captain Holly Cao said. “We came away a little bit disappointed that we had one win out of the three matches, but it was a good weekend for gaining more experience. We performed pretty well in doubles, which we were happy about.”
Known to struggle to earn the doubles point in the past, Harvard managed to turn the tides this weekend, winning the doubles point in two of its three matches.
“The coaches have been trying some new partnerships and have been putting an increased emphasis on doubles,” Cao said. “It paid off this weekend, which was good to see.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 1
The Crimson (3-5) opened the tournament strong with a solid victory over the Big Red (4-2).
“We knew that we could get a victory over Cornell, so we stuck to our game, played a solid match, and were happy to come away with the win,” Cao said.
Wins on the No. 2 and No. 3 courts secured the doubles point for Harvard, and strong singles play reinforced the Crimson’s command of the courts.
No. 47 Cao continued to dominate at the No. 1 position, taking her singles match, 6-1, 6-1.
Sophomore Hideko Tachibana earned a victory in straight sets on the No. 2 court, 6-2, 6-2, and sophomore Kristin Norton won in three sets in the No. 3 position.
While co-captain Samantha Rosekrans dropped a point for Harvard on the No. 5 court in three sets, close straight-set victories by freshman Natalie Blosser and junior Samantha Gridley on the No. 4 and No. 6 court, respectively, secured the Crimson’s final two points of the match.
“We played really well and came out competing,” Tachibana said. “We had a lot of momentum going and took care of business that day.”
YALE 6, HARVARD 1
With Harvard’s opening day play earning it a berth to the semifinals, the squad met a tough match in the Bulldogs (9-2), falling to the tournament’s eventual champions.
“Yale’s a tough team filled with pretty good team-players,” Cao said. “Even though we lost this one, every single match was close, and we hope that next time we can come away with the win.”
Despite an 8-2 win on the No. 3 court by freshman Hannah Morrill and Rosekrans, the Bulldogs took an early lead in the match by capturing the doubles point with wins on the No. 1 and No. 2 courts.
Cao gave some hope to the Crimson with a win on the No. 1 court, 7-6, 6-0, yet this would turn out to be Harvard’s only point of the match. Cao remained undefeated in singles play this season, boasting a 6-0 individual record.
“Holly is obviously a very valuable asset to our team,” Tachibana said. “We can always count on her to do a great job.”  Tachibana and Blosser suffered three-set losses on the No. 2 and No. 4 courts, respectively, while Norton, Rosekrans, and Gridley fell narrowly in straight sets on the No. 3, 5, and 6 courts.
“Yale is always a personal battle,” Tachibana said. “We had a good opportunity to see what they have, and we know what we have to do next time.”
BROWN 4, HARVARD 1
Playing for third-place on Sunday, the Crimson suffered a defeat to Brown (4-5), landing it in a fourth-place tournament finish.
“We were confident that we were playing well, but fatigue hurt us, and Brown got the upper hand,” Cao said.
Harvard started off strong by claiming the doubles point and the early lead with Tachibana and Norton earning a win on the No. 1 court, 8-6, and Cao and Blosser dominating in the No. 2 position, defeating their opponents, 8-4.
But the Crimson squad was unable to maintain its momentum and lost its first four completed singles matches in straight sets on the No. 3-6 courts.
Cao was leading her match in the No. 1 position, and Tachibana had split her first two sets when the matches were abandoned due to time constraints.
“Overall, it was a pretty good weekend for us in terms of just getting more match play and seeing how the rest of the Ivies are playing right now,” Cao said.
After defeating Harvard in the semifinals, Yale went on to defeat No. 36 Princeton in a close 4-3 win to secure its third straight ECAC title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even for the high-scoring Harvard women’s hockey team, seven goals is a lot.
Playing with something to prove in its final regular season weekend, the Crimson rode to an easy 7-0 victory over Colgate on Friday at the Bright Hockey Center. In the process, Harvard (15-9-4, 14-4-3 ECAC) more than doubled the Raiders (11-17-3, 8-10-2) in shots on goal and capitalized on numerous power-plays.
Tri-captain and defender Leanna Coskren scored two goals for the Crimson in the first period of play, both during a 5-on-3 advantage, while sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded the shut-out at Bright Hockey Center on Friday night.
“What we’ve been focusing on is trying to come out really hard in the first period, which is the thing that we’ve lacked in some of our games,” Coskren said.
In the first frame, Colgate recorded five penalties in seven minutes. Harvard dominated the ice with clean passing, as their scoring rampage began in the tenth minute of play with a goal by freshman forward Kalley Armstrong.
Less than three minutes later, Coskren netted her first of two goals during a power-play, assisted by tri-captain and forward Kate Buesser and sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey.
Buesser followed up with a goal of her own at the 14:20 mark, and Coskren capped off the Crimson’s domination in the frame after tallying her second goal, thanks to another Dempsey feed.
But even after the scoring onslaught, Harvard coach Katey Stone was not satisfied.
“[I told them] it’s 0-0, we’ve got to keep getting better,” Stone said.
The Crimson began the second frame with tough defense led by two strong Bellamy saves, as the Raiders could not capitalize on any of their three power-play opportunities.
On the other hand, Harvard continued to dominate possession, giving Dempsey the chance to allow sophomore defender Josephine Pucci to send the puck flying over the left shoulder of Colgate goaltender Kimberly Sass halfway through the second period.
But, Dempsey wasn’t finished.  With three minutes left on the clock, the sophomore fed the puck to freshman forward Lindsey Fry who buried the goal, putting the Crimson up six on the scoreless Raiders.
“It was the 5-on-3’s I think, and I happened to be the low kid down there in those goals,” said Dempsey about her ability to notch four assists. “I was getting some shots on net, and people were there to put [the puck] away.”
Entering the third period, Harvard continued its strong passing against Colgate, allowing sophomore forward Kaitlin Spurling to set up junior forward Alisa Baumgartner for the Crimson’s seventh and final goal at the 15:20 mark.
Harvard’s dominant performance was shown in the numbers, too, as the Crimson outshot the Raiders 34 to 16.
“We had everybody playing tonight, trying to keep kids fresh,” Stone said. “We’ve worked a little bit on our power play, worked on our penalty kill...and it seems to be working for us.”
After its tough 3-1 defeat to Boston College at the Beanpot, Harvard had this final weekend of the regular season to earn its six seniors a win before the ECAC playoffs.
“I think we’re just a lot more hungry now that it’s the end of the season,” Dempsey said. “This home weekend, it’s huge. We hate to see the seniors go, and so everybody is playing a little harder.”
Though the Crimson led the all-time series against Colgate, winning 17 of 20 matchups, its previous contest with the Raiders earlier in the season was much more of a struggle for Harvard. After being down 1-0 at the beginning of the game, the Crimson battled back to a 3-1 victory, with goals from Buesser, Armstrong, and Coskren.
“Last time we played Colgate we just barely won,” Dempsey said. “I think [our progress] shows on the scoreboard.”
The conference win puts Harvard at No. 2 in the ECAC going into the post-season tournament, granting the Crimson guaranteed home ice all the way to the semifinal round of play.
“It’s our ice, we know it inside and out,” Dempsey said, noting the importance of home ice during tournament play. “We’re out here everyday, so it’s going to be nice to really have some pride on the ice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a two-game undefeated streak into the weekend, Harvard men’s hockey looked to gain momentum with the playoffs approaching.
But after stretching its streak to three games by defeating Cornell (11-7-2, 13-11-3 ECAC) on Friday in Ithaca, the Crimson (6-19-1, 4-14-1) could not finish a weekend sweep, falling at Colgate (7-23-2, 4-14-2) on Saturday.
Sophomore forward Danny Biega continued his recent strong play, scoring a total of two goals and recording two assists on the weekend. Biega has notched three goals and five assists in his last four games.
Both games proved to be close, but late goals were the deciding factors in the matches for Harvard.
“Friday we played pretty well...We got the win,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “Saturday, we didn’t play as good of a game.”
COLGATE 2, HARVARD 1
On Saturday night at Starr Rink, the Crimson and the Raiders faced off in a defensive struggle, but Colgate found a way to squeeze out the victory.
“I thought it was a good game, although we didn’t play a full game like the night before against Cornell,” senior goalie Kyle Richter said.
Though Harvard struck first with a power-play goal from Biega, the Raiders responded a little more than three minutes later with a goal of their own. After the first two goals, the game stayed knotted at 1-1 for the entire second period and for most of the third.
The Crimson tried to break open the match early in the third frame, but the players could not find the back of the net.
Just as overtime seemed to be imminent, Colgate forward Robbie Bourdon fired a shot that bounced off a defenseman and past Richter for the score.
“The last goal was not a lack of execution but miscommunication,” Richter said. “Their guys got an open lane in our zone.”
Harvard was not able to respond, and the game ended in a disappointing loss for the Crimson.
Richter played a solid game, saving 26 out of 28 shot attempts by the Raiders and keeping Harvard competitive. The defense also played well enough to keep Colgate from getting the go-ahead goal until the end.
“It was a good effort by everyone in our own zone,” Richter said. “I thought guys did a good job of cleaning rebounds out.”
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 3
Against the Big Red at Lynah Rink, the Crimson netted a late goal to secure a victory over Cornell, one of the better teams in the ECAC.
The Big Red jumped out to an early lead with a goal from defenseman Nick D’Agostino in the first minute, but Harvard responded quickly with scores by junior forward Alex Killorn and senior forward Michael Biega later in the frame.
Cornell outshot the Crimson in the period, but Harvard headed into the first intermission with a 2-1 lead.
Midway through the second frame, the Big Red evened the score, but Killorn responded with a backhander off a rebound just over four minutes later that gave the Crimson a 3-2 lead.
Senior goalie Ryan Carroll made crucial saves in the game and finished with 27 stops. The Harvard penalty kill was also effective, as the team kept Cornell from scoring on three power play chances.
The final frame began with another game-tying Big Red goal, but the Crimson broke through once again on a cross-ice pass from the elder Biega to his younger brother, who sent a one-timer into the back of the net.
Cornell was unable to tie the game, and Harvard left Ithaca with a 4-3 victory.
Both Biega brothers finished with a goal and two assists, and Killorn recorded two goals of his own.
The power play was especially effective in the game, as the Crimson went 3-for-4 with the man-advantage.
“We moved the puck as quickly as we could, getting shots to the net,” Huxley said. “It was one of the goals going into the weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend the Harvard women’s water polo squad carried its offensive arsenal to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., for the Marist Invitational, which pitted the team against five different opponents over the span of three days.
The Crimson came out strong on Saturday, remaining unbeaten after defeating Siena, 19-6, and Boston University, 19-2.
Harvard received its first loss of the season at the hands of host team Marist in a narrow 13-10 defeat on Sunday, despite starting out the day with a victory over the Dollard Water Polo Club (DDO).
The road trip closed with a loss to now-No. 15 Hartwick College.
HARTWICK 20, HARVARD 5
The Crimson faltered in its final and most important matchup of the weekend when it entered the pool to face the Hawks on Sunday.
Hartwick came out strong, capturing an early 7-0 lead. Although the Crimson was able to match the Hawks goal for goal in the second period, the fatigue of a five-game weekend hit Harvard in the second half.
Hartwick was the first team this season to hold the Crimson offense to a single-digit score.
The Hawks’ pool caused Harvard some trouble, due to the fact that it was shallow-deep, meaning at times the players were standing on the bottom of the pool.
“It’s almost like playing on a 70-yard football field or an eight-foot rim in basketball,” junior co-captain Devan Kennifer said. “Though it’s not an excuse for the loss, we will work to do better when we play them again on April 2.”
MARIST 13, HARVARD 10
In its closest match of the season, Harvard battled back in the fourth quarter but came up short in its match against the Red Foxes, dropping its first match of the season.
“In the middle of the third quarter, they got some momentum and we let their home crowd into the game,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “We almost tied the game [at 10 goals apiece] with 1:20 left, but they pulled away in the end.”
Harvard was buoyed by strong defensive showings from both Kennifer and junior goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy, who came up big with 10 saves.
Kennifer had yet another standout performance on both ends of the pool, pitching in five steals and five goals.
HARVARD 18, DDO 6
The Crimson began its second day of play in the Marist Invitational against DDO and showed off its offensive talents in defeating yet another team by double digits.
The Crimson’s defense was also a solid part of its success. Sophomore attacker Aisha Price, who contributed seven steals, and junior attacker Shannon Purcell, who also contributed four steals, made life very difficult for DDO
Freshman attacker Shayna Price led the way with seven goals and two assists.
“I had a lot of really good opportunities and was set up well by my teammates. It was definitely a team effort,” the younger Price said.
HARVARD 19, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 2
In its second match of the weekend, the Crimson defeated local rival Boston University’s club team with a balanced offensive attack, receiving scoring contributions from 10 different players.
Shayna Price, junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski, and sophomore two-meter guard Elise Molnar led the way with three goals each.
“We have talented players top to bottom who play the system well and have been able to put the ball in the back of the net,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 19, SIENA 6
The Crimson started the weekend out strong with a powerful showing in an early-morning tournament debut.
Harvard jump started its three-day campaign, quickly capturing an 8-2 lead in the first quarter.
Kennifer played well on both sides of the ball, supplying four goals and four steals.
After their weekend success, Minnis and his team expect a lot of support and a win when they return to Blodgett Pool to face Brown tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Saturday’s matchup between the Harvard and Cornell women’s hockey teams proves to be a preview of the ECAC title game, the conference championship is still very much up for grabs.
After falling behind, 3-0, in the first period, the Crimson (15-10-4, 14-5-3 ECAC) nearly sent the No. 2 Big Red (26-2-1, 20-1-1) to a winless weekend, ultimately falling, 4-3, on Senior Day at Bright Hockey Center.
“As I mentioned to the kids in between the second and third period, there are no moral victories,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It was a great hockey game overall, but we’re not going to sit back and say, ‘Oh, we played well against Cornell, who’s the No. 1 team in the league.’ We’re not happy we lost.”
The first minutes of the game were marked by a quick tempo and few shots on net. But with a goal off the stick of Brianne Jenner 12 minutes into the period, Cornell seized control of the game’s momentum.
Jenner skated up the right side of the ice, took a long pass from linemate Karlee Overguard and beat sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy to the right side of the cage.
That goal sparked a five-minute stretch in which the Big Red built what proved to be an insurmountable three-goal lead.
“They’re good, and if you give them time and space, they’re going to hurt you,” Stone said. “We were on our toes, being pretty aggressive at the beginning, and then we backed up...I know [the players] are all pretty bent out of shape, they wish they could have the first period back, but that’s hockey.”
At the 14:26 mark, Chelsea Karpenko doubled Cornell’s advantage, stuffing a rebound off Catherine White’s shot past Bellamy. White then added a goal of her own three minutes later, tipping in a shot from Laura Fortino.
Suddenly, the Crimson was staring down a 3-0 deficit heading into the first intermission. But rather than give up on a game that was meaningless in the standings—the teams had already secured the top two seeds in the conference playoffs—Harvard returned from the break rejuvenated.
“I think we played the last 40 minutes with great desire,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “If we had played the whole game like that, we would have had a different decision there.”
The Crimson was in control offensively for the whole second period, outshooting the Big Red, 18-8, in the frame. After a particularly strong shift in which Harvard’s third line was able to keep pressure on Cornell netminder Lauren Slebodnick, the Crimson was finally able to break through at the 6:22 mark.
Junior Alisa Baumgartner skated the puck into the offensive zone, putting a long shot on net. Slebodnick made the initial save, but sophomore Josephine Pucci was there to scoop up the rebound, backhanding the puck into the net as she fell to the ice.
With one goal already on the board, Harvard picked up the pace, testing Slebodnick repeatedly. The freshman goalie held strong through a mid-period power play, but with six minutes left in the frame, Buesser brought her team back within one.
The tri-captain picked up a deflected shot from freshman Marissa Gedman, carried the puck right up the middle of the offensive zone, and lit the lamp.
“They just were determined, they kept it simple, they went to the net, they dug, and they played with a chip on their shoulder,” Stone said of her team’s second-period performance. “And they need to.”
The Crimson kept its foot on the gas for the remainder of the period, but despite a productive power play late in the frame, it could not find the equalizer.
Freshman Kalley Armstrong was whistled for hooking 1:40 into the third, and it didn’t take Cornell long to take advantage of the power play.  The Big Red needed only 23 seconds to cycle the puck around to White at the right post, and the junior knocked it past Bellamy for the 4-2 lead.
But Harvard fought back again, capitalizing on a power-play opportunity of its own at the 9:54 mark. Freshman Lyndsey Fry hit classmate Gina McDonald with a pass, and the rookie put a shot on net. Slebodnick deflected the puck into open ice, and sophomore Jillian Dempsey swooped in and slammed the rebound into the open side of the net.
The Crimson outshot Cornell, 12-10, in the third period, and had plenty of chances to tie the game up—particularly on its two power plays in the last eight minutes of the game. On the first power play, Big Red defender Lauriane Rougeau made a big play in the crease to break up a key opportunity, and on the second, Pucci hit the pipe with 1:30 to play.
Stone pulled Bellamy with 33 seconds to go, but despite a 6-on-4 advantage generated by Karpenko’s tripping penalty, Harvard could not tie it up.
“[It’s] extremely frustrating,” Buesser said. “We don’t come to these games for just coming close and almost. We came to this game [for] a win, and it’s frustrating. But we just hope next time we’ll bury those, for sure.”
The Crimson’s six seniors—Ashley Wheeler, Katharine Chute, Deboray Conway, and tri-captains Leanna Coskren, Liza Ryabkina, and Buesser—were recognized after the game, their last regular-season game in a Harvard uniform.
The Crimson ends the regular season in second place in the conference standings, and the team will host seventh-seed St. Lawrence (16-16-2, 11-11-0) in a best-of-three playoff series beginning on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No matter the sport, the time, nor the place, the constant mark of a great team has been achieving a “three-peat”—a goal which the Harvard men’s tennis team set out to achieve this past weekend, as it hosted nine other teams at the Murr Center in hopes of attaining its third consecutive ECAC Indoor Championship.
Harvard (5-5) got off to a great start in the first round, edging Brown (6-1) on Friday, 4-3. The Crimson faced a worse fate in the later rounds, losing to Cornell (8-3) on Saturday in the semifinals, 5-2, and then falling to Princeton (5-2) yesterday in a consolation match, 6-2, to end up in fourth place in the tournament.
“Our league is remarkably even,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “It’s just one of those things where on a given day, you could have five different outcomes.”
PRINCETON 6, HARVARD 1
Fighting for third place against second-seeded Princeton, the odds did not work out very heavily in Harvard’s favor.
Despite the dominant doubles force of junior Jonathan Pearlman and freshman Casey MacMaster, who extended their four-match win streak with an 8-1 victory, the Crimson conceded the doubles point.
In the singles, junior Felton grabbed Harvard’s lone point with a thrilling three-set victory at the No. 2 position. After both players split the first two sets, Felton managed to pull out an 11-9 third-set win over the Tigers’ Matt Spindler.
Junior Davis Mangham, who looked poised to take a point himself in the No. 6 match, toughed out a similar three-set match, only to fall to Princeton’s Dan Davies, 10-8, in the third.
CORNELL 5, HARVARD 2
Against top-seeded Cornell, the Crimson faced stern opposition from the tournament favorites. The squad conceded the doubles point after falling short of a win in all three of its matches.
Most dramatic was the finish to an 8-6 duel featuring senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and sophomore Josh Tchan. The duo was on the verge of a comeback, but five points in a row for Cornell swayed the momentum against them.
In the No. 6 matchup for the singles, Mangham looked to set the tone early on. He won, 6-2, in the first set, but dropped the second set, 6-3. It came down to the final set, but the tiebreaker proved just too much for Mangham, as the Big Red’s Zhongming Chen scored a narrow 11-9 victory to take another point for his squad.
Three matches later, the Crimson had narrowed Cornell’s lead to one point following dominant performances from Nguyen and Tchan at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively. Nguyen dominated the Big Red’s Mirza Klis 7-6, 6-2. Tchan followed suit with a 6-1, 6-2 finish over Cornell’s Jeremy Feldman.
“We had a strong showing in singles,” captain Aba Omodele-Lucien said. “Andy Nguyen dismantled his opponent, who kind of threw everything but the kitchen sink at him, and Josh Tchan played unbelievable, the best he’s played all year.”
Eventually, the Crimson fell to the Big Red 5-2 on the day, ending its dreams of championship contention this season, with identical 6-3, 6-2 losses for Pearlman and Felton.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 3
Harvard kicked the weekend off on Friday with a narrow win over No. 5 Brown. All started well, as the Crimson swept the Bears in all three doubles matches to take a 1-0 lead.
Omodele-Lucien and Tchan partnered up to finish off their opponents by a close 8-6 margin.
In the singles, competition was much tighter, but strong performances from Pearlman at No. 1, Nguyen at No. 4, and MacMaster at No. 6 proved just enough for Harvard to edge Brown on the day, moving the hosts into the semifinals.
On the whole, the squad’s showing this weekend may have disappointed in results, but the program is still optimistic about the remainder of its season.
“Overall, I thought we fought hard,” Fish said. “We know the other competition is very good, and we know they fight hard too. We’ve got a lot of work to do in the next month for the Ivies, but I think we didn’t disappoint.”

Coming off two losses on the road, Harvard (14-8, 6-2 Ivy) outlasted the Big Red (5-18, 2-7) Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, winning 73-68.
Cornell came into the game riding a five-game losing streak but played defiantly against the hosts. The Big Red never let Harvard out of reach, hitting a crowd-quieting three every time the Crimson got on a run. Cornell freshmen Shelby Lyman and Allyson Dimagno accounted for eight of the Big Red’s 10 three-pointers.
“I’m not surprised [that] they were scrappy; I’m not surprised they came at us the way they did,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We beat them pretty handedly [at Cornell], and they’re the classic young team with nothing to lose, going after the team that’s in the race.”
With 5:02 left in the game, the Big Red got within six, but sophomore Victoria Lippert took control of the game, scoring eight straight points and building a double-digit Crimson lead with 2:32 left on the clock. Lippert led Harvard with 15 points and added six rebounds, while converting on 2-of-3 from beyond the arc.
The Big Red responded and shrunk the lead to five with 52 seconds left. But junior point guard Brogan Berry stayed calm and sank both her free throws to give Harvard the 70-63 lead.
“I really like having my hands on the ball at the end of the game, no matter the pressure,” said Berry, who later added another free throw and made the game-winning steal to close it out.
The junior finished out the game with 12 points and eight assists while shooting 50 percent from the field.
Starting off the first game of Alumnae Weekend, the players also showed their solidarity with raising awareness for breast cancer by wearing pink shoes or laces, as well as pink t-shirts while sitting on the bench.
Both teams began the game shooting almost exclusively from beyond the arc. Rookie Christine Clark began the night for the Crimson hitting a trey on the assist from co-captain Christine Matera. The Big Red responded with a three of its own and added two free throws to take the lead.
After swapping another pair of threes, Cornell took its last lead of the night, 8-6, with 17:44 to play in the first half. Harvard slowly scored seven points over a four-minute span, capped off by a deep three-pointer by Berry.
With 12:30 on the clock and the Crimson ahead, 13-11, both teams exhibited sloppy offense, combining for five turnovers and three steals.
But Harvard regained composure, going on an 8-2 run led by senior Emma Markley, who scored six of the eight points. Markley scored 10 of her 14 points in the first half, while the rest of her points came in the first minute of the second half. The senior closed out the night of her birthday with 11 rebounds, good for her second straight game with a double-double.
“They couldn’t stop me in the first half,” said Markley, who added that she “just tried to play as strong as possible.”
The Big Red defense couldn’t stop the Crimson near the basket, as noted by the 30 points in the paint compared to Cornell’s 14.
Harvard not only closed out the half with two jumpers and a free throw to take the lead, 33-28, but also came up with an emphatic block on the other side of the court with the clock expiring. The Crimson went into the locker room shooting a solid 45 percent from the floor in the first half, but Cornell’s 62-percent shooting from beyond the arc kept the visiting team in the game.
Harvard extended its lead to start off the second half, but with 17:15 left, Lyman struck again with a three to cut the lead to six. The next seven minutes saw the Crimson unable to distance itself from the Big Red. Despite hitting 63 percent of her shots in the first half, Markley went cold, shooting just 2-of-9 in the second half and missing her last seven shots.
With 10:58 left in the game, Cornell sank another trey to limit the Harvard lead to six. The Big Red added a jumper to bring it to a four-point game before Berry responded with two clutch free throws. On the next possession, the Big Red made a jumper on a second-chance opportunity, bringing the deficit back to four.
But sophomore Elle Hagedorn set the stage for Lippert’s run, sinking back-to-back three-pointers with 6:16 left in the game.
“It felt great,” she said. “Unfortunately, we let them score right back but…I think we really needed the energy boost [to finish the game strong].”
“We came together as a team, and we weathered it, so we’re walking out with a win,” Delaney-Smith added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was more than just an Ivy League grudge match when the Harvard women’s basketball team (15-8, 7-2 Ivy) faced Columbia (5-19, 4-6) on Saturday night. Alumnae weekend, Pink Zone night for breast cancer awareness, and the potential of junior guard Brogan Berry hitting her 1000th point had Lavietes Pavilion buzzing—and the Crimson did not disappoint.
Harvard finished a solid first half only to extend the margin and put away the Lions halfway through the second, sending Columbia back home with another conference loss, 77-46. The Crimson has swept the series with the Lions this season.
“I thought we had a really good team feel and team chemistry today,” freshman guard Christine Clark said. “It was just a really good game dynamic-wise.”
Harvard got the first half off to a strong start with a 4-0 run in the first two minutes after Clark and senior forward Emma Markley scored back-to-back layups.
The Crimson didn’t maintain the lead for long, as the Lions pushed back, tying the score five times as both squads exchanged the lead twice in the first 10 minutes. But Harvard grabbed the momentum off of a clutch play by sophomore guards Victoria Lippert and Jasmine Evans, where Lippert intercepted a Lions pass and delivered it to Evans for a baseline three.
Harvard and Columbia turned the ball over 14 and 16 times, respectively, making for a fast-paced half with few shot attempts but great defense on both halves of the court.  The highlights of the Crimson’s defense included big, crowd-pleasing blocks by Clark and co-captain Jackie Alemany.
The half culminated when Berry reached her 1000th career point for Harvard, but she didn’t allow this triumph to diminish her focus.
“It’s a great honor, just a lot of hard work over the last three years,” Berry said. “I realized I was close, but I really didn’t think about it going into the game. It’s just like any other game; I just want to win and get the victory for my team.”
The Crimson used the energy from Berry’s accomplishment, plays like Evans’ three, and its cheering section filled with alumnae to build its largest lead of the game—12 points—with 2:49 left. The home team set the score at 32-23 to end the half.
Coming out of the break, Harvard scored first and quickly, with a jumper by Berry followed by a Clark layup, setting the tone for a Crimson-dominated second half.
Columbia called a timeout at 18:08 with the score set at 36-23 in an attempt to slow Harvard’s momentum, and the tactic seemed to work, as the Crimson and Lions alternated scoring over the next couple minutes. But a huge block by Markley and her layup on the other end terminated Columbia’s scoring push and allowed Harvard to stretch its lead.
While Clark played well in the first half, she out-did herself in the second. Notably, she sank a three-pointer as the shot clock expired while her court awareness allowed her to pick up the ball, off the body of the referee, and score two points.
“I expect nothing less from her,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I am as excited about coaching her as I’ve ever been about anybody. Her work ethic is off the charts. She’s unselfish. You can criticize her, you can correct her—she’s a sponge. She just wants to get better and better, and she’s fiercely competitive.”
In her 33 minutes of play, Clark made 84.6 percent of her shots from the field en route to her career-high 28 points.
But Saturday’s game was truly a team effort. Of the 13 players who entered the game, 10 chipped in points. And those who didn’t provided integral assists, defense, and ball control for the Crimson.
“I thought it was really good how everyone came in and contributed,” Clark said.  “A lot of people got playing time and helped get the win.”
Despite a tough full-court press, Harvard managed to expand its lead to 31 points with just over two minutes remaining.
“I loved that we were able to stretch the lead,” Delaney-Smith said, “which is something that we haven’t done as much as I think we should be able to.”
Winning this game meant an alumnae-weekend sweep for the Crimson women.
But despite the victories, Harvard is gearing up for a grueling week of practices. Next weekend, the home team will face Yale and Brown, two teams the Crimson lost to earlier in the month.
“We’re going to focus on our game this week,” Delaney-Smith said, “I’m not going to focus a whole lot on Brown, I’m not going to focus a whole lot on Yale; I’m going to focus a whole lot on Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a packed crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Harvard wrestling squad had one last chance to salvage its season in front of its home crowd, but the team just could not pull it off.
The Crimson hosted Columbia and Cornell this weekend for its final duals of the season, looking to pick up one final win, but dropped both matchups for its fourth and fifth losses in a row.
Harvard (2-15) lost to the Lions first on Friday, 32-7, but then suffered an even worse fate against the Big Red on Saturday, getting trounced, 40-9. Although the team lost by a large margin, the Crimson tied for the most points an Ivy League squad has scored against No.  1 Cornell.
Despite the losses, two Harvard grapplers, sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman and classmate Steven Keith, stood out and recorded wins in the last home matches of the season.
“They did awesome,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “To pull [off] those two wins for us was great.”
NO. 1 CORNELL 40, HARVARD 9
Going up against Cornell, Harvard was not expected to win but managed to post big victories.
Keith started things off with a major upset over 10th-ranked Frank Perrelli at 125 pounds. In the third period, Keith was up, 3-1, and it seemed that he would be able to easily ride out the time for the win. All of a sudden, Perrelli turned the tables on Keith and got a takedown for two points to send the match into overtime.
In overtime, neither opponent was able to earn an escape, but Perrelli almost pinned Keith early on. Later in the tiebreaker, Keith earned a quick escape and kept his opponent from scoring another point to eke out the victory, 4-3.
“Right before overtime in the Cornell match, I said, ‘You’re going to win this match,’” Weiss said. “You could tell in the body language of both wrestlers. I thought the Cornell wrestler was tired, and Steven was getting even stronger as the match went on.”
The matchup at 157 pounds between No. 6 Peppelman and No. 11 DJ Meagher did not disappoint either. After the first three minutes, neither wrestler had managed to score a point. After trading escapes, the matchup was still tied at 1-1, and it looked as if there would be another overtime battle. Peppelman put a stop to any notion of going into extra periods by pinning his opponent with 45 seconds left in regular time.
“I was excited going into the matchup because he was one of the wrestlers that beat me earlier this year,” Peppelman said. “My strategy was to wrestle hard and trust our training.”
COLUMBIA 32, HARVARD 7
Against the Lions, Harvard fared slightly better in the point differentials, but still dropped the first of the team’s two losses for the weekend.
The biggest match of the night came in the final contest that pitted co-captain Andrew Knapp and Columbia’s Kevin Lester at 285 pounds. The two remained even throughout most of the match, both failing to score a point at the end of the first period, and remained tied at one after seven minutes to send the match into overtime.
After they both picked up quick escapes, Lester earned another two points for a reversal. Knapp’s only hope to continue the match was a takedown. At one point, it seemed as though Knapp had his opponent down, and there was a dispute over whether Knapp scored the two necessary points, but the referee ultimately lifted Lester’s hand in the air, declaring him the winner.
“I’m always telling my athletes, ‘Don’t let it come down to the official,’” Weiss said. “I thought, especially in that match, Andrew should have taken it into his own hands.”
Even though it has been a less than favorable season for the Crimson wrestling squad, Harvard’s standouts still have a chance to redeem their season—as did J. P. O’Connor ’10 last year—at the upcoming EIWA Championships and the NCAA Championships..

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From improved personal bests to strong team performances to falling off cliffs, Harvard skiing had an eventful weekend in Middlebury, Vt. The Crimson finished yet again in ninth place out of 12 schools with 410 points in the Middlebury College Winter Classic.
Fellow Ivy League school Dartmouth finished first. The two-time defending EISA champion Big Green won its first carnival of 2011 after finishing behind the University of Vermont in the previous contests.
Snow conditions were tough on Friday, with the snow being extra soft.
“The snow broke through and got a little bit ruddy and bumpy” said alpine coach Tim Mitchell.
To try to improve the conditions, officials put salt on the snow over night, making the ride down the mountain much smoother. But squalls on the other side of the mountain made the visibility very challenging, testing all of the skiers’ ability to cope with the adverse conditions.
The Harvard women’s ski team held up well this weekend, having solid performances in both the relay and individual events. The three-woman team of freshman Jen Rolfes, sophomore Esther Kennedy, and sophomore Alena Tofte finished an impressive sixth place in the sprint relay. Unlike races that usually start with a mass start or individual start, the relay race in Middlebury this past weekend had a special format. Each member of the relay team skied one kilometer, three separate times, trading off the relay handoffs in between each leg.
“The relays were a lot of fun. It was really cool to have a different format, and it was a fun, spectator-friendly course,” Tofte said.
Tofte also finished an impressive 15th place in the Nordic skiing downhill, with teammate Kennedy following behind her in 29th place.
“I think I started off a little too fast,” Tofte said about her individual race. “So I got to push myself. I think I had a pretty cool race.”
On the men’s side, sophomore Anthony Ryerson finished in the best position for the Crimson in 27th place.
In alpine skiing, both the men’s and women’s teams pulled out good performances. Sophomore Catherine Sheils landed in 11th place in the slalom, and junior Caroline McHugh finished 24th place in the same event. Sheils also had a career-best 13th place in the giant slalom.
“[Thirteenth place] is an outstanding result for her and is by far her best giant slalom result ever, so that was really great,” Mitchell said. “It’s an opportune part of the year to start to put it all together, so that was fantastic for her.”
Junior Kevin McNamara finished as a top performer for the men’s team, ending up in 27th place in the slalom and 31st place in the giant slalom, despite competing when the courses were at their worst.
He started 63rd and 71st in the slalom and giant slalom, respectively.
“He improved his start position more than anybody else that day,” Mitchell said. “Putting two solid runs together, two days in a row, I would say is a huge accomplishment for him. He definitely scored more team points this weekend than he has in his three years at Harvard, so that was really good to see from him.”
While many members of the Harvard squad finished well at the Middlebury Carnival, one skier had a more painful weekend. On one of her free runs between slalom races, freshman Rebecca Nadler took an unfortunate fall over an unmarked cliff.
“When I landed I was ejected from my skis and did a few somersaults,” Nadler said. “I’m totally fine. I just have a bit of a sore back, and I scratched my face up a little bit…It could have been a lot worse.”
And indeed it could have been. Nadler had already qualified for NCAA Nationals, so she has a different goal for the EISA Championships this upcoming weekend.
“It would be awesome to get on that podium, but I’d really like to get some solid runs in just to get my confidence again and not hold back,” Nadler said.
While Nadler will be skiing to get her confidence back, the rest of the team will be looking to qualify for NCAA Nationals in their final regular season races of the season.
Mitchell feels confident in Harvard’s ski team after this weekend’s result.
“People really started to piece it together,” Mitchell said. “Also, this weekend’s races are at Sunday River, which is a facility we’ve trained extensively at this year and over the last few years. So, all the athletes feel very comfortable there and are comfortable with the hill. The kids seem to ski pretty well on that hill, so I’m pretty hopeful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team suffered a pair of losses this weekend on its road trip to Pennsylvania, losing 3-1 to Saint Francis (5-5, 1-3 EIVA Tait) Friday night and 3-0 to Juniata (11-6, 4-0) Saturday afternoon.
The losses were the Crimson’s first on the road, with the scores exactly matching those of last year. Harvard (6-3, 0-0 EIVA Hay) got a strong performance from freshman Kyle Rehkemper, who recorded 23 kills over the weekend, but could not pull out a victory in either game.
JUNIATA 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson struggled in the first set against the Eagles at the Kennedy Sports and Recreation Center, dropping three consecutive points at the beginning due to attack errors. Juniata would go on to take the set, 25-15, thanks to an efficient offense that made life difficult for the back row of the visiting team.
“We ran into a really good team on our first away weekend,” Rehkemper said, “and I don’t think we were mentally prepared for them to come out so strong from the start.”
Although Harvard kept it close early in the second set, tying the game at five all, the Eagles rallied off freshman Alex McColgin, who posted a game-high 10 kills. Juniata recorded 16 kills with just five errors en route to a 25-18 victory.
The Crimson came out determined in the third set, keeping the game close until the score was tied at 15. But the home team gained the momentum needed to finish the match after a time out, putting it down twice and adding a late ace to gain a 21-16 lead. A service error from Harvard freshman Michael Owens led to a 23-18 deficit, and the Eagles used back-to-back aces to seal the match, 25-18.
“They got an early jump on us, and the atmosphere really favored them,” Rehkemper said. “They were able to keep the pressure on us all game. But I think it will be a different story when they come play us at home.”
Junior co-captain Matt Jones and rookie Chris Gibbons led the Crimson with eight kills each, and sophomore Rob Lothman dished out 28 assists.
SAINT FRANCIS 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard started off strong in the first set at DeGol Arena, capitalizing on a sluggish Red Flash team to take a quick lead. Offensive errors plagued Saint Francis as it struggled to catch up, but the visiting team never let go of its lead, taking the set, 25-22. The Crimson recorded 10 kills in this set alone, with Rehkemper racking up four.
Harvard started strong once again in the second set, building a quick 13-9 lead. But the situation suddenly became reversed as the Red Flash established its offensive rhythm, storming back to take the set, 25-19. Led by its outside hitters, three of whom reached double digits in kills, Saint Francis tied the game through a combination of great blocking and offensive efficiency, recording 14 kills in the second set.
“They came out kind of sloppy,” Jones said, “but they tightened up the rest of the game. They kept getting better game by game. They made more serves. They missed eight serves in the first set…but after that, they started cutting down on their errors.”
From that point forth, the Red Flash never looked back, taking its momentum and sweeping the next two sets by the same score, 25-19. Saint Francis capitalized on the struggling Crimson offense to take a 14-7 lead in the third that it would not relinquish. Likewise, the Red Flash built up a 16-12 lead in the fourth set on its path to victory.
“We weren’t able to turn it around,” Jones said, “and our offense never got going.”
Although Harvard recorded respectable hitting totals—11 and 13 kills in the third and fourth sets, respectively—Saint Francis was just more efficient, recording 15 and 11 kills, respectively, with an above-.500 percentage in both sets.
Jones had a rare off night, finishing the game with nine kills and 10 errors.
“I hit terribly tonight,” Jones said. “They did a good job of blocking on the outsides.”

President's Day is typically eclipsed by other, more remarkable holidays. However, two miniature hats adorning the iron fences along Garden Street tell a different story.
Vicky Y. L. Ge '12 stumbled upon the crocheted cuties on her way back from the Agassiz Theatre yesterday afternoon.
"I almost walked past them the first time, but these two tourists were taking pictures of them with their iPhones," Ge said. "I thought, how cute, someone took the time to celebrate President's Day, just to make people look twice."
Considering their resemblance to two of our famous presidents's headwear—a top hat for Honest Abe and a white wig to represent our nation's first president, George Washington—these two were were likely created in honor of President's Day.

Friday became a dark day for Harvard's legendary economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw after his iconic "Ec10-mobile," a light blue BMW easily recognizable by its "EC10" license plate, met its demise as Mankiw drove home from work.
As he was driving through an intersection, a car on the other side of the road turned left into Mankiw's BMW, resulting in the crash.
"I think the other driver was not paying attention," Mankiw said. "I was glad that everyone was okay ... It's a tribute to modern engineering."
While he was grateful that there were no injuries, Mankiw expressed sadness that the car was beyond repair.
"I'm going to have start looking around," he said. "Right now, I'm driving my daughter's Honda Fit. It's a little small."
Though unsure which model of car he will eventually buy, Mankiw said that he hopes to preserve his iconic license plate.
He was surprised, however, that his little blue car was so well known.
"I'm shocked that this is newsworthy, but this is your call," he said.

The Leadership Institute at Harvard College and the Office of Career Services sponsored The Art (and Taste) of Leadership last Wednesday afternoon in Boylston Hall. Students listened to speakers including Joanne B. Chang '91, owner of Flour Bakery and Café, and Steve "Nookie" A. Postal, executive chef for the Boston Red Sox, discuss the importance of leadership in the culinary world and stayed afterward to sample food from local businesses.
