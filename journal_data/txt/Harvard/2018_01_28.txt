After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a low-scoring and gritty affair, Harvard men’s basketball kept its unbeaten streak in conference play through a 54-52 road victory against Yale Friday night.
The Crimson’s overall defensive tenacity was epitomized in its last meaningful defensive frame with 12 seconds to play. Down by three, the Bulldogs (8-11,1-2 Ivy) executed a string of passes to deliver the ball into the hands of sophomore forward Miye Oni. sophomore wing Justin Bassey flew in from Oni’s left and tipped the shot attempt, ultimately landing in classmate Seth Towns’ hands to seal the victory for Harvard (8-10, 3-0).
Although Bassey’s denial was not officially credited as a block, the play was the capstone of the wing’s stifling defensive outing. Largely responsible for covering Oni—Yale’s leading scorer—Bassey limited the wing to just seven points off 3-of-13 shooting while picking up two steals and five boards.
Although this was the seventh straight game in which the Crimson failed to put up over 65 points, Harvard currently leads the Ancient Eight in points allowed with 53.3 points per game. Including non-conference games, the mark of 65.5 points/game puts coach Tommy Amaker’s squad in the top 35 nationwide in this category.
PLAYING THROUGH BIG LEW
In the course of 40 minutes, Harvard scored just three points on the fast break. Of its total 54 points, nearly half—26— came in the paint. Sophomore forward Chris Lewis, who accounted for seven made field goals and 16 points, played a leading role in this slower-paced, methodical offense.
Amaker placed Lewis on the left block throughout the course of the entire game, matching him up mostly with Bulldogs freshman Paul Atkinson. The Crimson backcourt aggressively fed the Alpharetta, Ga. native from tip-off, positioning Lewis in various spots in the interior to curl to his left hook or deploy a right-handed layup.
“Its very hard to stop [Chris], that was why we wanted to play through him,” Amaker said. “That was the point of emphasis. We always want to play inside out and having Lewis as our interior presence...I thought he came through big time for us tonight and especially in the second half. I thought he made the biggest difference in the game.”
Although Lewis did not pick up any assists in the contest, several successful Harvard possessions concluded with a feed-out to the wing from the big man followed by a second pass. Towns, positioned the entire game on the left corner baseline, delivered five assists while Amaker’s other primary wings in Bassey and junior guard Corey Johnson also combined for six assists.
One challenge for Lewis, however, is developing improved consistency from the free-throw line. In the final minutes of action, the Crimson earned numerous opportunities to stretch out its lead at the charity stripe.
Yale had exceeded the foul limit at the six-minute mark, giving Lewis two late game one-and-one attempts. The season 65-percent free throw shooter rimmed out on both initial shots, keeping the game tied at 47-47 and 49-49. Towns, who delivered two critical free throws in last weekend’s Dartmouth game, also missed on consecutive foul shots with his team up by three in the final two minutes.
SECOND HALF SCORING DROUGHT
In back-to-back games, Harvard has squandered early second-half margins and required a late game revival to defeat its hosts.
Against the Big Green, the Crimson was held scoreless for a five-minute stretch in the final twelve minutes, allowing Dartmouth to even the game with 2:03 remaining. Against the Bulldogs, this phenomenon occurred at almost the exact same span of the game. Down seven points with 10:38 remaining, Yale initiated a 13-4 run to take its first lead of the game with 5:11 left to play.
During this second scoreless drought, Amaker attempted to inject some fresh energy by inserting freshmen guard Rio Haskett and Danilo Djuricic into the lineup. Despite a quick drive-in layup by Djuricic, the points were nullified after an extended official review noted a clock malfunction. Soon after, the duo was subbed out in place of Amaker’s starters.
Sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken, who returned to the lineup after an extended month-long knee recovery, was given seven minutes of action in the second half. However, Aiken lacked a noticeable degree of mobility and agility in his legs and was kept scoreless in the second frame. Aiken’s only points of the contest came on a triple at the 13 minute mark of the first frame, his first bucket since December 6th against Fordham.
“We were just trying to see if we could find minutes for [Aiken] to get him back into any kind of game shape, game rhythm,” Amaker said. “The rhythm was the best way you could really see, he’s out of rhythm. That happens when you have been out as long as he has been.”
The limited options coming off the bench for Amaker created a substantially lopsided minutes distribution and resulted in Harvard quickly turning back to its starters to finish the game. All five of Amaker’s starters were on the court by the 6:27 mark, while Yale finished the game substituting several players in its eight-man rotation in order to play offense-defense.
This minutes distribution may also become an issue in Saturday night’s game against Brown, as the Crimson starters have already logged a combined 165 minutes of play this weekend. In comparison, Yale’s starters accounted for 24 fewer combined minutes.
Amaker’s dependence on his starters, however, has so far equated to victories. This type of resiliency down the stretch will be critical if these extended droughts and opponent runs persist.
“We always know that we have been there before and we understand that we are playing a great team,” Lewis said. “Through our past games and our intensity in practice we knew how to keep our composure, knew that we were going to get a good shot. As long as we lock down on defense, we would be able to stay until the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—It was a career night for sophomore forward Seth Towns on Saturday at Brown.
In what became a back-and-forth effort between the Crimson and the Bears, the Columbus, Ohio native finished the night with a career-high 30 points on 11-of-19 shooting from the field and a perfect four-of-four from deep to give Harvard the 86-77 win on the road.
“Just my teammates getting me in the right positions, and hitting shots like I didn’t do last night,” Towns said. “The way my teammates spread the floor and how everybody was a threat today kind of opened the floor for me. It’s easier when you’ve got good teammates.”
Despite the offensive outpouring from Towns, Brown (9-8, 2-2 Ivy League) closed in on a Crimson (9-10, 4-0) lead late in the second half. After Harvard went up 15 following a three from sophomore guard Bryce Aiken with 13:46 to go, Brown went on a late run of its own.
It began with a pair of free throws from junior guard Obi Okolie at the 13:12 mark.
From there, freshman guard Desmond Cambridge would nail threes on back-to-back-to-back possessions—all told, the Bears would score 11 in a span of less than two minutes to pull within five. In the same stretch, the Crimson failed to hit a field goal with its only point coming at the free throw line.
“He’s a hard cover, he’s so athletic and quick,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said of Cambridge. “He can really shoot the ball. He made some big ones to keep them alive and I think he’s got a really bright future in this league.”
Cambridge finished the night with a team-high 22 points, four rebounds, and two assists.
While Cambidge’s outpouring pulled the Brown within five with just over 11 minutes to go, it would be as close as Brown would get for the rest of the night—following the freshman’s three at the 11:35 mark, junior guard Corey Johnson came right back and drained a three of his own to make it a three-possession game.
Brown would pull within five again at the 8:09 mark, but with both teams in the bonus, Harvard found itself at the charity stripe for much of the rest of the game to close it out.
After sitting out for much of the past month and playing only sparingly at Dartmouth and Yale last night due to injury, Aiken came up big for the Crimson off the bench. The sophomore played 20 minutes, finishing with 18 points and three rebounds. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year found himself at the line throughout the night, finishing with 11-of-12 shooting from the free throw line.
“Getting to the line for him, 12 times, is always a key and he’s been a big piece to our ability to get to the free throw line which we have lacked since he’s been out,” Amaker said. “Bryce and Seth being two of our best players and best scorers especially with Chris Lewis being in foul trouble majority of the game.”
The career night from Towns came just in time, as Brown clawed back into the game following a first half offensive outpouring from the Crimson that occurred for the second night in a row. Much like it did on Friday, Harvard got going early, starting the game up 13-0 behind a perfect five-of-five shooting from the field.
Despite the lead, and much like it did against Yale on Friday, the Crimson defense gave way to the Bears’ offense late in the first, as Brown would enter the intermission trailing by just four.
“We just haven’t been good when we have had leads,” Amaker said. “Obviously you give the opponents a lot of credit for fighting through and coming back, but we haven’t been able to sustain and that’s a concern of ours right now that we have had great stretches and started off really well here tonight and last tonight.”
The win gives the Crimson its 17th consecutive win against the Bears and keeps Harvard undefeated in conference. Brown has not beaten the Crimson since March 6, 2009.
“It wasn’t easy, we had cushions there, big leads there, couldn’t hold it, certainly had to make a variety of different kinds of plays to win this game tonight against a team that put everything on the line against us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few net-minders outplay the Harvard men’s hockey team not once, but twice in a season. Colgate sophomore Colton Point appears to be one of them, however. In three career appearances against the Crimson, he’s sitting pretty on a .990 SV%. Saturday night was no different.
Harvard (9-8-4, 8-5-3 ECAC) threw shot after shot at the Raiders’ net, only to be held off the scoresheet entirely in a disappointing 2-0 loss. For his part, Point hit a new career best of 51 saves on the night to loud applause from visiting fans. But the Crimson won’t give all the credit to a hot goalie after going scoreless on the weekend.
“It’s frustrating,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 more than once after the loss. “[But] you have to find a way to break through. It’s not good enough to say we ran into [Point] and we got a lot of shots.”
The Crimson’s unfruitful night was not for a lack of trying. Harvard outshot Colgate (11-11-4, 7-6-1) by 10 in each period of the game to a total of 51-21, and the middle period especially saw chaotic scrambling in the Raiders’ blue paint. On one play, a shot from the point caught junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage between the skates as he tried to fight off a Colgate defender right in the slot.
Falling, Zerter-Gossage poked the puck through between Point’s legs and it trickled free behind the goaltender. But a roaring Bright-Landry was ultimately disappointed, as Point caught the puck with his paddle before it could cross the goal line.
“I saw the puck go through me, “ Point recalled. “I looked back and got my stick down in time… It’s a lucky save, but when you’re working hard, you tend to get bounces your way.”
The game’s result rested just as much on special teams as it did on Point. After going a perfect 3-for-3 the night before on the penalty kill, the Crimson conceded both Colgate tallies while playing a man down. Both shots came from just beyond the right circle, beating tri-captain goalie Merrick Madsen near-side through some traffic.
The first, 14 minutes into the opening period, was off the stick of junior defenseman Willie Brooks after a clean Raiders faceoff win. The second came from sophomore forward Bobby McMann with a tired penalty-killing unit on the ice, early in the third.
Madsen made his first start in net after watching two games from the bench, having conceded five goals—including a slapshot from beyond the blue line—against Clarkson on Jan. 19. Despite what the shot totals might suggest, Madsen did have to fight off several quality Colgate chances, including odd-man rushes and point-blank looks from the slot.
“[Madsen] was solid,” coach Donato said. “When the score was 1-0...he kept us in the game. I thought he battled.”
Alas, hockey cannot be won without scoring goals. This weekend, Harvard was shut out in consecutive games for the first time since 2011, when it fell at Yale and to Northeastern on Feb. 4 and 7, respectively. That season, the team skated to  a pedestrian record of 12-21-1.
Now, with the nation’s leading goal-scorer, junior Ryan Donato, sporting the crimson and white, the goalless homestand is far more striking. This is the first time all season that Donato has been kept off the scoresheet entirely for two straight games.
“We’ve got to find another gear,” coach Donato said. “We’ve got to find a way to play with a lot more conviction in and around the front of the net.”
The frustration began to bubble over, perhaps, in the third frame. Freshman forward Benjamin Solin engaged in some shoving with Point after charging to the front of the Raiders net and knocking the goalie off balance. Later, sophomore Nathan Krusko took a seat for boarding a Colgate player. Coach Donato, though, would not justify “desperate” hits like this one with highflying emotions.
“No one likes to be shut out,” began coach Donato when asked about the boarding penalty. “But in general, I wouldn’t want to qualify any bad hit by saying, ‘The team’s frustrated, that’s okay.’ I don’t like to see those hits in hockey at any time.”
Looking ahead, Harvard will have to resolve its offensive woes while also deciphering its situation between the pipes. While neither Madsen (2 GA, .905 SV%) nor junior Michael Lackey (2 GA, .926 SV%), who started against No. 2/4 Cornell on Friday, had particularly bad showings, the backstop job is still up for grabs.
“We’re going to see if we can get a hot hand, and let the play on the ice decide,” coach Donato said. “[Madsen’s] got a track record and had some success, and [Lackey’s] played well as of late, but I don’t really look too far ahead as to what that’s going to look like.”
The Crimson, normally steady at Bright-Landry, also suffered its first winless weekend at home since Feb. 2014. With a chance to pick up four crucial conference points—not to mention redeem losses in early November—Harvard finished the weekend with none. The Crimson icemen have now been swept by both Cornell and Colgate in their regular season series.
As the ECAC standings tighten, the Crimson will head up to Dartmouth next weekend in its last game before the Beanpot begins, hoping to find more success there against a hot Big Green team.
