After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maddalena Bearzi, whose research on worldwide dolphin populations revealed remarkable similarities with humans, discussed how human actions have negatively affected oceans and increased the likelihood of dolphin extinction Friday, at a lecture and signing for her recently published book.
 
“Sometimes I get asked if dolphins survive in polluted areas,” Bearzi said Friday night to a packed lecture hall at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. “The answer is, no they don’t. That’s why we need to take care of our oceans. My research is taking a more conservation-oriented approach because I believe that we don’t have the luxury anymore to just do research on these animals.”
 
Bearzi told the audience that her travels and encounters with creatures of the sea convinced her of the majesty of the ocean, particularly an encounter with a blue whale. 
 
“I remember the blowhole of the whale was the size of my caddy cabin—I felt as small as a toothpick,” Bearzi said. “Just imagine, a small child could walk on one of the arteries of this animal, its heart is as big as my Mini Cooper!”
 
To the budding field biologists in the audience, Bearzi spoke to gender stereotypes and other adversities she overcame while starting her career in Italy.
 
“I wanted to study animal behavior in the field, but it wasn’t always easy or proper, for that matter,” Bearzi said. “We Italians can be just a tiny bit conservative, and for many people, a woman’s place was in the kitchen rather than out in the field studying large animals.”
 
However, even when Bearzi got the job, she realized the field wasn’t as glamorous as she had imagined.
 
“I had been on a research sailboat only once, and guess what? I got seasick,” Bearzi lamented. “So my romantic idea to be out at sea, following dolphins, suddenly clashed with the reality of being green and nauseous.”
 
She eventually overcame her seasickness, and, on one occasion, was a party to the rescue of a dying woman. A school of dolphins she had been studying led her team directly to the woman, leading Bearzi to wonder about the heroic aspect often attributed to animals.
 
“Many scientists don’t believe that dolphins can save you because there isn’t enough hard scientific evidence, but that day, those dolphins brought us to save that girl,” Bearzi said. “Was that a coincidence? I’m still wondering about that today.”
 
But without intervention, Bearzi pointed out, the rapidly-declining population of dolphins may soon go extinct.
 
“Each of us has a say in the future of dolphins, of whales, and the oceans, and our own species,” she said. “And I do believe that exercising that say is our chance for greatness, perhaps our last chance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than a month away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. On Thursday we profiled St. Joeseph's. Next up is Vermont.
In its first game following the Thanksgiving break, the Crimson will take on the defending America East tournament champion Vermont. Last season, the two teams tussled in a close battle in Burlington, Vt., with Harvard ultimately pulling away in the final minutes to prevail, 55-48.
Though the Crimson’s roster has seen quite a bit of turnover since the end of last season, things have been relatively stable in Vermont. Building off a conference tournament upset of No. 1 seed Stony Brook and their subsequent NCAA tournament bid last season, the Catamounts were recently picked to take first in America East in a preseason poll.
Vermont has lost its top two scorers from a year ago, Four McGlynn and Matt Glass, but the squad carried a balanced scoring attack throughout the season, with five players averaging at least 7.0 points per game.
When the Catamounts visit Lavietes Pavilion, their two biggest scoring threats will be a pair of junior forwards, Luke Apfeld and Brian Voelkel. Voelkel, a former America East Rookie of the Year, was one of six players named to this year’s preseason America East All-Conference team. Standing at 6’7 and 6’6, respectively, these two will provide a match for Harvard’s similarly sized frontcourt.
But the catalyst to Vermont’s success is its defense. The Catamounts allowed just 60.9 points per game last season and held opponents to 40.6 percent shooting from the field. Vermont’s defense was on display in last year’s matchup, in which it held the Crimson to its fourth lowest point total of the season.
Given their high preseason standing, the Catamounts should come to Cambridge with quite a bit of confidence, especially after their first NCAA tournament win (a first round victory over Lamar) since upsetting Syracuse in 2005. But Harvard will have postseason ambitions of its own, making this an intriguing battle between mid-majors vying for another shot at the Big Dance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After achieving their goal of leading the Crimson back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 66 seasons, former men’s basketball co-captains Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12 aren’t ready to step off the court just yet.
Both players announced on Friday that they had signed professional contracts to continue their careers abroad.
Wright will be playing in Uppsala, Sweden in the Swedish Basketball League, while McNally signed with the Moncton Miracles of Canada’s National Basketball League.
“Couldn’t be happier with the situation that I am going into,” Wright wrote on his Tumblr.  “Its an amazing feeling.  I finally know the next chapter of my journey and i am ready to go.”
The 2010-11 Ivy League Player of the Year finished his Crimson career as the program’s all-time leader in blocks and in fifth place on its all-time rebounding list. Wright originally sought to follow in the footsteps of Jeremy Lin ’10 and play in the NBA, but he did not receive an NBA contract after playing with the Dallas Mavericks’ summer league team.
On Friday, Wright posted a photo on his Tumblr of pair of a text messages he received from Lin, which read “CONGRATULATIONS BRO!!!” and “Do work. Every opportunity is a stepping stone and a building block for the next challenge.”
Lin’s former backcourt mate, McNally, finished his Harvard career as the program’s all-time leader in games played and in second place on the team’s free-throw shooting list. The San Francisco native will join the Miracles for the next five months, with the seasion tipping off Nov. 4.
“Just officially signed my first pro contract with the Moncton Miracles in the Canadian NBL,” McNally tweeted Friday. “Excited to get after it and start up the season.”
The former Crimson co-captains will be joined overseas by some of their former rivals. Yale’s Greg Mangano will be playing in Turkey, Penn’s Zack Rosen will be playing in Israel, and Princeton’s Doug Davis—who hit a buzzer-beater over McNally to send the Tigers to the 2011 NCAA tournament—will be playing in Germany.

HANOVER, N.H.—There would be no hangover in Hanover for the Harvard football team.
Following last week’s stunning collapse at Princeton, the Crimson (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) rebounded on Saturday at Memorial Field by topping Dartmouth, 31-14. With three weeks to go, the win, combined with the Tigers’ loss to Cornell, puts the Crimson back in control of its own destiny for at least a shared championship.
“I thought our kids showed great character, great resolve,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Last week, no matter what you say, was a great dent to our psyche and morale.”
Just as it did against Princeton, the Crimson went into the half with a three-score lead before surrendering two Big Green (4-3, 2-2) third-quarter touchdowns to let the home team back in the game.
But this time, there would be no comeback, as the Crimson secondary, despite allowing another 300-yard passer, was able to hang on and help Harvard pull out a win.
Four seconds into the fourth quarter, senior running back Treavor Scales scored his third rushing touchdown of the game, capping a six-play, 55-yard drive.
The senior had touchdown runs of three and two yards in the second quarter while senior quarterback Colton Chapple scampered for a 16-yard touchdown in the first to give the Crimson a 21-0 lead at the break.
On the evening, Scales and Chapple led a Harvard rushing attack that collected 200 yards on the ground, while the Crimson—first in the FCS in run defense—limited Dartmouth to 19 yards rushing.
“Stopping the run is one of the things we focus on each week,” senior defensive end John Lyon said. “It’s something we expect ourselves to really do well.”
The Big Green, looking to gain any advantage it could get, started the game with an onside kick—which it recovered—but the offense quickly went three-and-out. Upon taking over, Chapple led the Crimson on a seven-play, 93-yard drive, completing passes of over 20 yards to senior Kyle Juszczyk, junior Cam Brate, and junior Andrew Berg before taking it in himself off play action.
Early in the second quarter, Dartmouth quarterback Alex Park was picked off by senior linebacker Alexander Norman, who had a costly dropped interception last week against the Tigers. This time, Norman hung on and returned the ball to the Big Green six, and two plays later, Chapple ran the option and pitched to Scales, who rushed it in on the left side.
On the next Harvard possession, Big Green linebacker Garrett Wymore was called for roughing the passer on a third and 14 from the Dartmouth 41, giving new life to the Harvard drive. Scales later capped the 13-play, 70-yard series with another score to put the Crimson up 21.
“We played a heck of a team out there,” said Scales, who finished with 89 yards on the day. “I was just proud of my fellas for really rising up to the occassion.”
But in the third quarter, Dartmouth got back in the game. With 10:08 to go in the quarter, Park hit wideout Michael Reilly—who finished with a career-high 12 catches for 165 yards—for a 22-yard score.
On the first play of Harvard’s next possession, Scales fumbled at his own 25, setting up the Big Green with great field position.
Dartmouth got down to the one, but on fourth and goal, the Crimson defense stuffed Big Green halfback Dominick Pierre short of the goal line.
“At that juncture in the game, we had a little bit of momentum,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “So there’s no second guessing, no regrets [about the play-call]—the only one we had is that we didn’t score.”
Following a Crimson punt, the Big Green took over at its own 32. On the first play of the series, Park hit Ryan McManus along the left sideline, and McManus broke six tackles before finally getting loose for a 68-yard touchdown run to cut the Harvard lead to 21-14.
But later in the quarter, Scales and Chapple had rushes of 19 and 14 yards, respectively, to set up a first and goal, and Scales finished the drive with a two-yard run.
“I think the big touchdown drive in the second half gave us a lot of momentum back,” Murphy said.
An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Dartmouth’s ensuing possession turned a 3rd and 2 at the Harvard 43 into a 3rd and 17 at the Dartmouth 42, forcing a Big Green punt.
After the teams traded three-and-outs, Chapple orchestrated an eight-play, 37-yard drive that was capped by a David Mothander 25-yard field goal to put Harvard up, 31-14. The Big Green came up short on first down on its ensuing drive, and the Crimson was able to run out the clock.
Harvard, which came into the contest leading the FCS in sacks per game, finished with six sacks, including two each by Lyon and sophomore Zach Hodges. Hodges is tied for the Ivy lead with eight sacks, while Lyon is second in the conference with seven.
“I thought our guys played hard,” Teevens said. “I thought we competed well, but I’m proud of the way my guys played.... [Harvard is] a very good football team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly six months after it went viral, the Harvard baseball team's "Call Me Maybe" video is still receiving national attention in unlikely places.
With Halloween around the corner, Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Nicole Bulcher tweeted a picture of herself with fellow cheerleader Katy Marie dressed up as—you guessed it—the Crimson baseball team in the middle of the now famous (or infamous) left-punch-right-punch-double-punch routine.
"Nailed the costume this Halloween season!" Bulcher tweeted.
We appreciate the Harvard shoutout, but six months after the fact? Sorry Nicole and Katy, might be a bit late on this one.

"How would your parents describe you when you were twelve?" Shy? Unruly? Already reading The Economist front to cover every night before bed? Don't laugh; it's an important question. So important, in fact, that it could determine your admission status to Harvard Business School.
On October 24, CNN Money published an article by John A. Byrne entitled "Harvard Business School Students Dish On Admissions Interviews." Byrne's piece focused in on the latest publication of The Harbus, HBS's newspaper—a forty-three-page, all-inclusive informational guide to acing your HBS admissions interview. It's called the "Unofficial Harvard Business School Interview Guide." Among the questions taken from the book and mentioned in the article were, "How would your parents describe you when you were twelve?" and "What is your favorite kind of chocolate?"
In the spirit of keeping up with the Joneses, or in this case, not being outdone by the business school, Flyby has set forth a list of pertinent questions Harvard College hopefuls should be expected to answer in their interviews. Each fits into one of the six categories of HBS interview questions listed in Byrne's article: experience, leadership, career, current events, curriculum, and situational.
Experience: How many waffles can you eat in one sitting?
(Implied question: Are you really up to the challenge of meeting your weekly Veritaffle-consumption quota?)
Leadership: Given only your wits and a wheel of cheese, how will you save the world?
(Resourcefulness. Resourcefulness is key. Saving the world is okay, too)
Career: So you're thinking you'll concentrate in Economics, right?
(Nod and smile.)
Current events: Who was featured on the cover of this week's edition of Cosmopolitan Magazine?
(It's important to pay attention to what's going on in the world. Reading The Economist, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal just isn't going to cut it anymore.)
Curriculum: What is the most pretentious, overly verbose, unnecessarily specific course name humanly possible?
(Note: this is a trick question. You need to come up with something that's not in the Harvard Course Catalogue.)
Situational: Given the option of a pogo stick, a pair of roller blades, or a unicycle, which do you choose to navigate your way through the crowd of tourists gathered in the middle of the walkway?
(Just a straightforward question of practicality. There is a clear right and wrong answer to this one.)

It's that time of year again when pumpkins fill the back wall of Annenberg, Starbucks brings back the Pumpkin Spice Latte, and students flock to The Garment District. The abundance of free treats and fun of the holiday can be overwhelming. But luckily, Flyby is here to help with a guide to the Halloween activates around Harvard Square.
Halloween Treats: 
What would Halloween be without the plethora of pumpkin-flavored food and drink? Grafton Street Pub's Saturday night party features music until 2 a.m. and a special Halloween menu featuring pumpkin fritters, true blood martinis, hot pumpkin cider, and southern tier pumpkin. On Tuesday night, Brattle Theater opens its Haunted House of Pancakes. For $5, watch an exposition of pancake films, along with a complimentary stack. And on Halloween, head to UpStairs on the Square for a harvest dinner made with all vegan ingredients.
Costume Contests: 
If you think you've got a particularly creative costume, why not give the catwalk a try? This Saturday, The Donkey Show is hosting a Halloween disco party, which includes party favors for all guests and prizes for unique and disco-themed costumes. And on Halloween night, UpStairs on the Square's annual party includes a special menu and "Scary-oke", not to mention a prize for the winner of the costume contest.
Other Festivities: 
To add a scare to Halloween night, the Cambridge Historical Tours presents its Spooky Pub Crawl, which includes food and drinks Cambridge bars and restaurants accompanied by ghost stories from a costumed host. Lush Cosmetics hosts its Monster Bash on Saturday, celebrating the release of their limited edition Halloween products. For an extra laugh on the 31st, check out The Comedy Studio's performance at 8 p.m. on the third floor of the Hong Kong. And lastly, for some nostalgic fun, the World's Only Curious George Store opens its doors for seasonal stories and free treats starting at 10:30 a.m. on Halloween. All ages are welcome.
