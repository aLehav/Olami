“Millennium Approaches”—the first part of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning play “Angels in America”—has the potential to be performed either as a riveting commentary on the height of the AIDS epidemic and what it truly meant to live as a homosexual in this time, or as a sorry excuse for intertwining the clichéd dramatic motifs of death, abandonment, love, religion, and truth. Friday’s opening on the Loeb Mainstage—directed by Sara L. Wright ’09—overflowed with a vitality that managed to make these overdone themes appear refreshingly novel.The three-hour-long piece (schedule your dinner plans for before curtain call!) is a series of interconnected stories of individuals wrestling with deviant identities in Reagan-era New York City. The floor design—a white web of sorts—mimics the interwoven nature of the narratives; streaks of red and blue remind the audience of the American ideals against which the characters are juxtaposed. Sets are minimal, as the script calls for numerous settings, and most furniture is on wheels so that it can be easily moved and given another use. This rapid movement suits the show well; it emphasizes the motif of change and migration, presenting each scene as a temporary meshing of two or more characters’ individual stories.The fourth wall is kept intact for the duration of the piece, ensuring distance between the audience and the actors and highlighting, intentionally or not, the gap in place and time between the two. Yet with the audience flanking either side of the stage (the show is set in the center of the Mainstage), even if the actors are not making direct contact with the audience, viewers can see others’ reactions and feel some sense of community in the theatre. The overall strength of the cast’s performance also helped forge a connection between those on and off stage. Scene I opens with Rachel E. Flynn ’09 conducting a funeral as a Yiddish rabbi—one of her many small roles in Part I, all of which are underscored by her knack for comedic timing and evocative facial expressions. It is soon revealed that the deceased is the grandmother of Louis Ironson, a neurotic gay Jewish lawyer. Gus T. Hickey ’11 uses mannerisms, including an obsessive habit of wringing his hands and wiping them on his trousers, bring out Louis’ neuroticism without overdoing it. Hickey, who is a Crimson Fifteen Minutes comper, delivered a convincing portrayal of the overly worrisome character, though at times he lacked conviction during Louis’ pivotal emotional scenes.Louis worries because his lover of four years, Prior Walter, has just been diagnosed with AIDS. Jonah C. Priour ’09 does a remarkable job with Prior’s decline, presenting him as disheartened but determined to retain composure and a sense of humor no matter the cost. He comes the closest of any of the actors to being able to elicit both tears and laughter from the audience within seconds of each other.Another standout performance is that of Benjamin K. Glaser ’09 as Roy Cohn, the mean-spirited conservative lawyer in denial about his homosexuality and AIDS affliction. Roy is not a likeable character, and when the veins in his neck are prominent and his hoarseness palpable, Glaser makes him seem like the devil. From obnoxiously loud eating habits to a quick instinct to stand upright after being shoved, Glaser adds touching subtleties that flesh out the height of Roy’s Napoleon complex. The unraveling of the Pitts, the play’s Morman heterosexual couple, is perhaps not as powerfully presented as the story of Louis and Prior, but it is effective nonetheless. Alex R. Breaux ’09 often displays a stoic demeanor that perfectly captures Joe Pitt’s struggle to fit the ideal of the nondescript, hardworking, heterosexual American male. (In reality, Joe is anything but the American ideal.) Even his costume (designed by Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11)—a suit complete with a red and blue striped tie—reflects his concern with an outward appearance and reputation that gets Uncle Sam’s stamp of approval. Anna Smith’s turn as Joe’s Valium-addicted, sex-starved wife Harper is not quite on par with Breaux’s performance. She has mastered Harper’s childlike sense of wonder but emits too much humor and cheerfulness during Harper’s moments of despair. These qualities serve her well in Harper’s scenes of fantasy but detract from the gravity of her problems in the scenes grounded in reality.After three hours of sitting through this incredibly heavy work, one would think the audience wanted nothing more than to escape. Yet despite what appeared to be some technical difficulties with the play’s final, explosive scene, the cast of eight’s seamless buildup of the most heart-wrenching human emotions begs the audience to return for the drama’s conclusion and ensures that—even with its treatment of hackneyed themes—this is not a play you’ve seen before.

“Angels in America” sweeps back into focus for its second night, more vibrant and complex than the evening before. The second half, fittingly called “Perestroika,” a Russian term for restructuring, initiates and affects a profound upheaval in the emotional and spiritual lives of its characters. As the vague connections between all six main characters begin to develop into close relationships, the masks slip from their faces, revealing what truly lies at their core. The most gentle characters, like Harper and Belize, turn out to have the greatest strength of mind and character, while characters that are accustomed to controlling the people closest to them, such as Joe and Roy, lose their power throughout the course of the play.In the end, a total catharsis has occurred in the lives of every character. The play is able to speak to all elements of American life, demonstrating that behind the dichotomous ideals of seemingly incongruous elements of contemporary America—homosexuality and religion—is the same desire for truth and honest self-expression.The characters of “Angels in America,” who, as Mormons and gays, represent contradictory elements of life in America, find themselves forced to confront their innate prejudices. In “Perestroika,” the conflict is heightened by the addition of a new dimension: the supernatural. Prior (Jonah C. Priour ’09), whose dignified response in “Millennium Approaches” (part one of the play) to the fact that he has AIDS invites general sympathy and approbation, is increasingly plagued by a mysterious voice.In Act Two, the disembodied voice finally crashes through Prior’s bedroom ceiling in the form of an angel, played by Isabel Q. Carey ’12. Carey—who also plays the Mormon Mother and Prior’s Nurse—knows precisely how to hold her head to convey a sense of otherworldly detachment and disdain for the world necessary to her part. She also gracefully pulls off swinging precariously through the air and dangling in space on pulleys with considerable aplomb. With an artistry of appearance, Carey’s angel invites a series of questions: is Prior insane? Has the strain of AIDS and abandonment at last gone to his head?The Angel reveals a prophetic book to Prior—hidden, oddly enough, in a suitcase beneath the tiles in his kitchen—and announces that he is a Prophet. His message is stasis; humans, with all their change and movement across the Earth, have compelled God to leave heaven and abandon the Angels. Why continue to live, the Angel asks, when life is so painful? Whether or not Prior has temporarily lost his mind, this vision provides him, and the audience, with a compelling sense of truth that is lacking in the rest of his life.As “Angels in America” departs more and more from reality, the logic of insanity becomes increasingly attractive to the characters. As he slowly dies of AIDS, Roy Cohn, the villain of the play, is consigned to a hospital bed and, horror of horrors, the use of a phone with no hold button. “How am I supposed to perform basic bodily functions?” he howls.Benjamin K. Glaser ’09 manages to make Cohn’s vitriolic hate charismatic; he may be entirely depraved, but he is vibrantly alive. As he lets go of life, he slips into a madness that may or may not be drug-induced. His conversations with Belize, the night nurse, become increasingly hallucinogenic, but even stranger is his relationship with the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg. Roy killed Ethel, and now she is back to watch him writhe in agony alone on a hospital bed. Rachel E. Flynn ’09 conveys with her eyes, from 50 feet away, a schadenfreude-inflected delight as she hovers over him. As the play spirals further into fantasy, the stage artfully descends further into ruin. In the beginning, props and staging are wheeled in and out neatly; by the end, furniture lies askew across the stage. We are surveying the ruins of order as the definition of place and belonging change forever. “Perestroika” begins with a rigidly demarcated world in which we know where everyone belongs—Mormons in Utah, gays in New York City. As the play goes on, the lines blur and the established order shifts. Personal insanity is just a symptom of the upheaval, and in fact, seems to be a small price to pay for the final, emotional catharsis that is affected at the end, in which differences are resolved. “The Great Work begins,” a radiantly confident Prior announces at the end of the play. Is it his Great Work, or our own?

Despite the cheerful and celebratory connotations of its title, Harold Pinter’s “The Birthday Party” is existentialist, absurdist, and dark. The latest performance put on by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club inspires moments of snort-inducing hilarity even as it elicits gasps. Directed by Matthew C. Stone ’11, the play skillfully explores the notion of identity, a crucial focal point in existentialist theater, while provoking a wide range of emotions from the audience.“The Birthday Party”, written in 1958, is one of Pinter’s most popular pieces, as well as his first full-length play. Like other existentialist plays, the story is secondary to evoking emotion and provoking an audience reaction.The play opens in the dining area of a boardinghouse in a coastal area of England, and immediately launches the audience into the dull lives of Petey and Meg, its proprietors. The entrance of Stanley, an irritable, washed-up pianist and the couple’s only client, adds to the monotony that typifies the characters of the play. However, the ominous arrival of two men dressed in dark suits—Goldberg and McCann—disrupts the established tedium. They inspire Meg to throw a birthday party for Stanley which ends in violence and mayhem, but ultimately results in a return to small-town ennui.This extremely well-cast group of actors successfully captures the contemplative spirit of the play. The disillusioned Stanley is the fulcrum of “The Birthday Party,” played to perfection by Timothy J. Lambert ’11. Through tense body language and agitated growls, Lambert portrays Stanley’s constant state of displeasure and distress. During Stanley’s breakdown, where he is backed against the wall after the party falls apart, Lambert’s maniacal laugh and terse movements create chills.Nick N. Commins ’09 and Eve H. Bryggman ’10, who play Petey and Meg, respectively, play off of each other well as an unhappily married couple. Though he is not present often, Commins is the first and last character to appear on stage, and his lethargic facial expressions, slouchy posture, and perpetual consternation effectively convey Petey’s anxious character. Meanwhile, Bryggman fidgets around restlessly, capturing completely Meg’s naïveté and eagerness to please. The highlight of Bryggman’s performance is portraying Meg drunk during the birthday party, at which point her inebriated silliness evokes peals of laughter from the audience.Also outstanding is Antonia M. Peacocke ’12, who brings a breath of fresh air to the performance as Lulu, the young and attractive girl from the neighborhood. As the youngest member of the cast, Peacocke—who is a Crimson arts comper—definitely holds her own, as she effortlessly conveys Lulu’s complexity by highlighting the character’s youthful innocence and desire to be mature.However, the greatest applause goes to Ben T. Clark ’09, who steals the show with his portrayal of Goldberg, the sweet-talking, temperamental Jewish gangster. Clark’s representation of Goldberg is well complemented by the theatrical efforts of castmate Justin A. Monticello ’09, whose character, McCann, confuses, amuses, and frightens. Monticello’s versatility is remarkable, as he comically shreds newspapers in some scenes, but seethes with frenzied rage in others.The minimalist set, created under the direction of designer Beth G. Shields ’10, is comprised mainly of a dining table, a few chairs, and a countertop. It highlights the existentialist nature of the play. Sound and lighting are also used sparsely by Stone and Lighting Designer Michael W. Zellmann-Rohrer ’10, but effectively, to heighten the emotions evoked from the audience.Though the play is hindered at several points by contrived acting, for the most part, the performers effectively and convincingly breathe life to Pinter’s critically acclaimed drama. The dedicated cast and staff work together seamlessly to engage the audience for an emotional two hours, during which innocence is lost, sacrifices are made, and lives are changed forever.

The choice of Steven Chu, the unanimously confirmed U.S. secretary of energy, to deliver this year’s Commencement address is both timely and prudent. A Nobel Prize-winning physicist with a nuanced understanding of the power of scientific innovation, Steven Chu possesses the serious expertise necessary to inspire both current policymakers in the White House and future leaders in Harvard’s graduating classes.
In light of his vocal environmental advocacy and concerted efforts to tackle the challenges of America’s energy dependency, Chu’s speech presents a unique opportunity to engage students with the pressing issue of global climate change. As director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Chu positioned the search for sustainable energies at the top of the institution’s agenda. The former Stanford professor also played an instrumental role in the creation of the Energy Biosciences Institute, a research and development organization dedicated to the emergent and multidisciplinary field of energy bioscience. With the aid of Chu’s scientific proficiency and leadership skills, the institute’s work in the production of biofuels and its insights into the socioeconomic repercussions of a national transition to sustainable energy have positioned it at the forefront of the effort to confront the challenges posed by global warming. Hopefully, the opportunity to hear from such an accomplished and knowledgeable figure will not only enhance students’ understanding of the contemporary energy crisis, but will also further inspire them to tackle these problems as responsible and engaged citizens.
Already in his role as energy secretary, Chu has expressed intentions to reduce fossil-fuel dependence, decrease greenhouse-gas emissions, and harness existing energy sources in the most effective manner possible. His stated goals, substantiated by his concrete achievements, square nicely with the university’s recent environmental initiatives. Yet, while the creation of the Office for Sustainability this fall and the articulation of six “Sustainability Principles” in 2004 represent laudable progress, Chu’s address should not serve as an occasion for Harvard to flaunt its achievements. The task of transforming Harvard into an environmentally friendly institution still requires much hard work—a fact that should not be obscured with premature self-congratulations.
Chu certainly does not possess the extensive celebrity of past Commencement speakers, and his pairing with Class Day speaker Matt Lauer represents a lower-profile lineup than those to whom Harvard students have historically been accustomed. However, Chu’s lack of widespread name recognition in no way forestalls him from delivering an engaging and insightful address. An eloquent proponent of novel approaches to achieving America’s energy self-sufficiency, Chu will surely offer important insights into the progress of our national efforts and the role of Harvard students in bringing these efforts to fruition. The choice of an energy secretary as Commencement speaker testifies to the importance of alternative energy research to both the university community and to our society at large. It also offers a rare moment to inform Harvard’s emerging graduates of the gravitas of their global social responsibility.

This past week, Dean Jay M. Harris announced that the print versions of the Q Guide, Courses of Instruction, and Handbook for Students would be eliminated. Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer became an online-only publication last month, and the Boston Globe struggles to survive. This year, more than any other, has demonstrated the uncertain future of the print media in all its forms. And, in its decision to exclusively publish online the information contained in academic guidebooks normally distributed in hard copy to all Harvard students each fall, the administration has wisely responded to a larger national trend in a way that could greatly benefit the Harvard community.The online versions of the formerly printed guidebooks will make it considerably easier to keep information up to date at all times. Before, it was often the case that the print version of the Courses of Instruction did not include all courses offered in a particular department, whereas the online version did. Converting entirely to an e-version will both eliminate confusion and, because of the Internet’s widespread availability, streamline the information-gathering process for students and faculty. Besides, printing thousands of copies of the guidebooks—which were only valid for one year—was wasteful and inefficient, and an online version will save money and prove more environmentally beneficial. But the mere absence of hard copies is not a solution to the larger problem of the current guidebooks, print or online. In their current condition, these guides—specifically the Q Guide—need a major reconfiguration, and we can only hope that the shift to an online version will be a catalyst for the necessary improvements. In order to ensure that the print version of the Q Guide will never be missed, the new online version should reinvent the previous guide. First, the rating rubric, which is currently limited to a “1 to 5” scale, should be redesigned to allow for a more honest evaluation of courses—perhaps even a change as simple as a “1 to 10” scale would do. Second, there should be links from the descriptions of courses to those of related courses, as the best feature of the print edition was the ease with which students could peruse all the courses in a particular department. And, in terms of ease, the new online-only version of the Q Guide should list courses by name and not only by number. Most importantly, however, the new online version should strive to be more effectively integrated with the my.harvard shopping tool. In its current state, the Q Guide does not even allow students to access course websites directly, a major and unnecessary inconvenience. In short, we hope that the shift to online guidebooks will improve the guides rather than merely transferring the current versions. Though the administration’s decision to publish academic information exclusively online is a good one, its ultimate effect will rest on the way in which that information is presented.

Though Europeans mock Americans for having no real culture of their own, there are certain values one never questions in this country. We treasure convenience, as symbolized by drive-through fast food, self-understanding, manifest by easy access to astrology charts at the check-out stand, and—most importantly—the importance of setting goals for the future, embodied in the American dream itself.
In an article in the Boston Globe published last month, Drake Bennett calls this last tenet into question. Bennett offers up examples of companies whose goal-driven business models led them to fail, from GM’s ill-fated drive to capture 29 percent of the automobile market to Ford’s disregard for warnings about the combustibility-prone Pinto in its disastrous determination to win back market share. What goes for business goes for life—Bennett quotes Adam Galinsky, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, who warns that goal-setting in general “can focus attention too much, or on the wrong things; it can lead to crazy behaviors to get people to achieve them.”
This certainly resonates at Harvard, where student ambitions drive them to absurd, unhealthful behavior as a matter of course. One student I know put himself through the gauntlet of a 14-hour-per-day summer lab job pipetting in the hopes of snagging a future Harvard Medical School admissions letter; another suffered an existential crisis because he felt that none of his extracurriculars were sufficiently frivolous enough to show employers he could have fun. The anxiety runs deep—next Wednesday, the Office of Career Services will attempt to soothe those whose goals have been dashed with a panel entitled “Reflections on Rejections,” in which a “booklet of actual rejection letters received by your deans” will be distributed. It’s hard to imagine precisely the consolatory value in flipping through the crushed dreams of one’s superiors, but this schadenfreude throws light on the meaninglessness of elevating goal-setting to such a sacred position in the first place.
There’s no reason to impose such strict career objectives upon oneself. Indeed, our particular educational system is a blessing in that it encourages exploration and creative thinking, a boon that hasn’t gone unnoticed by other countries. Over spring break, through the Harvard College in Asia Program, I had the opportunity to stay at Hong Kong University with a group of fellow undergraduates. The dean of education there informed us that the college is planning to reform its curriculum—a relic of British colonial rule—to bring it more in line with the American system. Rather than starting off their university years with a set major and pre-professional plans, students will now be able to dabble in the glorious uncertainty of a liberal arts education.
Granted, we ought not to throw out the baby with the proverbial bathwater; nobody’s suggesting that we should lack initiative. It makes sense for those who desire to be doctors to take organic chemistry or engage in lab work now, just as it makes sense for would-be writers to read novels and write for publications. Not setting strict goals, however, is much different from not working hard. Being 30-something and still living in your parents’ basement off vague dreams is not the successful result of a broad education. But to retain forever the mindset of being “pre-” something—pre-med, pre-law, pre-finance—has the potential to cut down on spontaneity, to close off options before they’re even considered. Those who define themselves as future members of a profession will find it difficult to ever truly inhabit the mindset of those outside their discipline.
And, surely, with the current financial crisis, this is just the right time to keep one’s mind open to unconsidered academic and job possibilities. While not having one’s life plotted out can be terrifying, given economic conditions—663,000 more jobs were cut last month, bringing the jobless rate to a record 8.5 percent—the danger may lie not in planning too little, but too much. According to U.S. Department of Labor estimates, the average American changes careers three to five times in his lifetime, making flexibility imperative. Perhaps it’s time for Harvard students to embrace the terror of unknowing and to check their aspirations—it may be the case that the road to hell is paved not with good intentions, but with overly focused ones.

Last December, the government of Sri Lanka held a day of national festivities to commemorate the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. In April, intense fighting continues between government and LTTE forces. However, the escalating humanitarian crisis of the Tamil civilians remains unheeded by the international community.
The war on the island of Sri Lanka is one of disparities on a number of accounts. It is commonly misunderstood as one between a terrorist group and a legitimate state, and its status as Asia’s longest continuing civil war—lasting 26 years—with deeply rooted ethnic tensions is not properly considered by the United Nations, the United States, or any other nation.
The proscription of the LTTE as a terrorist organization by the U.S.—followed by the U.K., the EU, and others after September 11—has created a diplomatic imbalance on the island, legitimizing the Sri Lankan government’s indiscriminate military attacks on areas populated by civilians without impunity. Since the government’s official withdrawal from a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE in 2008, its military campaign has internally displaced over 200,000 Tamils in the northeast of the island, killing and injuring thousands.
With its proclaimed goal of rooting out terrorism, the Sinhalese-dominated government of Sri Lanka has systematically destroyed and taken control of nearly all of Tamil Eelam. This is the minority Tamils’ homeland, rightfully defended and governed by the LTTE following the 2002 Norwegian-led ceasefire agreement.
Caught in the midst of the Sri Lankan army’s continued offensive against the LTTE, the displaced Tamil civilians are currently subject to moral degradation, hunger, and numerous acts of genocide. In the name of security, the government continues to effectively exploit the LTTE’s terrorist designation to confine Tamil civilians to “welfare villages,” a euphemism for internment camps surrounded by barbed wire.
In early March, 38 members of the U.S. Congress sent a joint letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton highlighting the fact that Sri Lanka is one of eight “Red Alert” countries experiencing ongoing or imminent genocide, referencing a ranking produced by the New York-based Genocide Prevention Project. Human Rights Watch had reported that, from early January to the end of February alone, over 2,000 Tamil civilians had been killed and over 7,000 injured. More recently, government forces continue to kill or maim an average of 100 civilians a day.
Yet it remains a war without witnesses, and independent reports are rare. Foreign journalists, monitors, and aid workers are banned from the epicenter of the fighting, making it increasingly difficult to produce meaningful criticism of the government’s actions.
The LTTE’s continued call for a ceasefire and insistence on international monitoring and aid for civilians goes unheeded by the UN. In mid-March, the LTTE’s political head, B. Nadesan, put out a call for the UN to directly investigate the situation on the ground instead of taking the word of the government of Sri Lanka.  
The immense call of the global Tamil diaspora, as well as independent voices to cease the violence and to support self-determination of Tamils, is similarly ignored and consistently fails to be put on the agenda of the UN Security Council. The protesting diaspora is of the same generation and people who have been subject to the Sri Lankan government’s discriminatory policies and violence since Sri Lanka’s independence from the British in 1948.
In mid-March, more than 120,000 expatriate Tamils demonstrated in Toronto, condemning the genocidal war and asking for international support. Countless other demonstrations carried out in London, Geneva, Paris, Washington, and all over the world have made calls for the international community to help stop the violence and recognize the LTTE as the voice of the Tamil people.
In his recent address to the World Tamils Forum in London, the American civil-rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson reiterated the right to self-determination and the importance of an immediate ceasefire before any political solutions can follow. Similar expressions of concern uttered by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, as well as the president of East Timor and Noble Peace laureate José Ramos-Horta, remain meaningless to the government of Sri Lanka, which considers the systematic subjugation of Tamils the only solution to decades of racial tension.

NASA recently held a poll to pick a name for the newest module in the International Space Station, hoping to build public excitement for its imminent completion. But instead of “Legacy,” “Earthrise,” or other sterile, optimistic names suggested by NASA, the winning name was “Colbert.” Television personality Stephen Colbert had encouraged his fans to write in his last name, even though, as he joked, “Houston may have a problem with it.”
For Colbert, NASA was an easy target for a prank. It’s hard to imagine a government agency more past its prime. Nearly every major manned program undergone by NASA since the early 1970s has run over budget and been delayed. Now, with the shuttle program ending, NASA will likely have to rely on Russian rockets soon (as early as 2011) just to get American astronauts to the space station.
Why has NASA had such a dismal track record since the Apollo program? Reduced funding tells part of the story. The space program received around $40 billion a year (adjusted for inflation) in the mid-1960s, which was at least four percent of the federal budget. But, back then, Americans also had a much greater tolerance for risk: The first successful Apollo mission was launched just eight months after the three astronauts in Apollo 1 died during testing. NASA’s tighter leash today means that riskier programs like nuclear-powered spacecraft don’t make it off the drawing board. Ultimately, NASA’s 1960s miracles were enabled by widespread public and congressional support fueled by the Cold War race to the moon.
That’s why the primary thrust of the current Constellation program, which plans to build a permanent settlement on the moon as a stepping stone to Mars, seemed good on the surface. Its ambition rivals the Apollo program, and its announcement came on the heels of China’s first manned rocket launch, suggesting a new space race was underway. Constellation also seems to have the support of Congress, which this year proposed increasing funding for the program (at the expense of NASA’s science budget) in order to return to the moon by 2020.
However, a new struggle against communism won’t save NASA. The red menace is hardly what it was, and, besides, we already won the race to the moon 40 years ago. Going back proves nothing, and there may be little to no scientific value to a permanent moon settlement. Mars is hardly realistic, because the lengthy cruise to get there would severely disfigure our astronauts. Prolonged habitation in zero-gravity environments might permanently cost astronauts a quarter of their skeleton due to osteoporosis. While many Americans view China’s space program as a threat, there is hardly enough political will necessary to fund such an ambitious proposal on a rapid timescale. The Orion capsules that will replace the space shuttle have already been delayed to 2015. It’s only a matter of time before waning interest spurs Congress to push the timeline back even further. Although President Obama has voiced support for the moon mission as of now, he already proposed delaying Constellation to pay for science education during his campaign.
Perhaps diverting funds from Constellation into unmanned missions makes more sense, as robotic exploration accounts for most of the important science being done by NASA today. The conventional counterargument asserts that the manned space program justifies its expense and its danger because it attracts the most attention, not just to NASA, but to science in general. But, even if that’s true, NASA severely underestimates the appeal of robots. Tiny Mars rovers launched five years ago for nearly half the cost of a single shuttle mission continue to receive nearly constant coverage, even for minor milestones.
Our government also doesn’t understand the reason that people follow manned spaceflight. Yes, there’s a childish glee in imagining Americans sifting Martian soil through their gloved fingertips. But people gravitate back to the manned space program because they see it as mankind’s cosmic destiny, not a way of proving American dominance here on Earth. Human space exploration has enormous potential to unite the people of the world in a project of mutual benefit. 
In fact, it’s likely that international cooperation to extend humanity’s reach past Low Earth Orbit would help bring about peace here at home, especially given that the major space players would probably be our erstwhile enemies China and Russia. The International Space Station shows that international cooperation is possible, at least on a small scale. Rather than try to leapfrog so far past China that they’ll never catch us, we should instead co-opt them into our plans for planetary exploration and let them help cover costs. It’s not too much of a stretch to hope that cooperation on space issues could lead to further cooperation on energy and climate issues as well.
NASA stated in the rules for its poll that the agency would reserve the right to pick the final name for the new module. Rumors suggest NASA may still use the name Colbert for a mission-critical component—the toilet. If nothing else, they’ve got a sense of humor.

The Harvard women’s tennis team played its best tennis of the season over the weekend. The Crimson (9-7, 2-0 Ivy) emphatically defeated Columbia (4-11, 0-3) 6-1 on Friday and blanked Cornell (6-10, 2-1) 7-0 on Saturday to boost its record in the past month to 7-2.“I think we are playing the best at this moment,” sophomore Samantha Rosekrans said. “Our goal has been to be the most improved Ivy League team, and thus far I think we’ve accomplished that goal.”Harvard had a complete performance, with strong play coming from up and down the doubles and singles lineups. Freshmen Louise Laciny and Camille Jania impressed by going undefeated in the two contests. Captain Laura Peterzan also excelled in the top singles position, going 4-0 on the weekend.“I’m really proud of our team right now,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “We’ve been fighting extra hard, and [we’re looking to] continue with our energy.” HARVARD 7, CORNELL 0 After easily defeating Columbia the day before, Harvard ran the risk of overlooking a less talented Cornell team. But the Crimson buckled down and took care of business by sweeping all six singles matches and taking the doubles point.“Obviously our goal is to secure the Ivy League title, but we’re doing a good job of staying in the moment,” Rosekrans said. “We’re trying to focus on one Ivy League match at a time.”In doubles, Harvard won at No. 1 and No. 3. Unable to play singles due to injury, senior Beier Ko teamed with sophomore Agnes Sibilski to take down Big Red opponents 8-4 in the No. 1 position. At No. 3, Jania and Peterzan triumphed 8-2.The Crimson zoomed through the singles portion, dropping just one of thirteen sets. At No. 1, Peterzan earned a 6-4, 6-2 victory, and at No. 2, Rosekrans squeaked out a three-set win. Though Cornell challenged both Sibilski and Laciny in the first set in the No. 3 and No. 6 slots, respectively, the Harvard players stepped up their games and cruised in the second sets. Sibilski won 7-6, 6-1, and Laciny defeated her opponent 7-5, 6-1. At No. 5, Jania prevailed easily 6-0, 6-2, and at No. 4, freshman Holly Cao earned a 6-4, 6-3 victory.Over the weekend, the freshmen played particularly well in the No. 4 through No. 6 positions. Both Jania and Laciny have won more than 50 percent of their singles contests in the dual match season. Since returning from injury, Cao is undefeated in singles, compiling a 4-0 record.“All the freshman coming in have been a breath of fresh air,” Rosekrans said. “That solidarity has really brought us closer together, and we’ve really improved a lot because of it.” HARVARD 6, COLUMBiA 1 Harvard opened its Ancient Eight season on a positive note, taking it to the Lions on the road. The Crimson opened the match with a swagger, winning all three doubles matches with ease. At No. 1, Rosekrans and Cao dominated 8-0. At No. 2, Jania and Peterzan defeated Columbia 8-2, and at No. 3, Sibilski and Laciny won 8-3.In singles, the Crimson continued its momentum. In the No. 1 slot, Peterzan shut out her opponent in the first set on the way to a 6-0, 7-5 win.  Rosekrans, at No. 2, and Cao, at No. 4, easily did away with their opponents in straight sets. At the bottom of the lineup, Jania and Laciny tamed their Lion counterparts with 6-4, 6-2 and 7-5, 6-2 wins, respectively.Harvard’s depth has been a major asset this season, as the team is getting production from all spots of its lineup. According to Green, the team is becoming more dangerous because all players are improving and different players have stepped up every week.Next weekend, the Crimson will host Penn and a nationally-ranked Princeton team. The Tigers should prove to be formidable opponents, though Harvard is confident it can compete with Princeton.“I think we brought a lot of energy and the result followed [this weekend],” Rosekrans said. “Even though we were expecting to beat Cornell and Columbia, we have a lot of momentum maybe to stage a big upset [next week against Princeton].”—Staff writer Jake I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For seniors returning from spring break, the time to start reflecting and winding down their college careers is nigh.
For the Harvard men’s tennis team, it is time to regroup, rebound, and retain its coveted Ancient Eight crown.
Mixed performances and closely-fought encounters were the order of the weekend, as the Crimson (9-8, 1-1 Ivy) began its Ivy League defense by suffering a narrow defeat against Columbia (13-4, 3-0 Ivy) and responding with a close win against Cornell (10-5, 1-2 Ivy)—a single point making the difference in each of the respective fixtures.
“Playing two of the top teams this weekend is just like putting all your poker chips on red at a roulette reel,” Harvard coach David Fish ’72 said. “And if it comes up black, you’re fighting uphill after that.”
Against Ivy League pacesetters Columbia, Harvard failed to capitalize on its opportunities and fell to a 4-3 loss—its first home defeat since the Crimson was beat by then-No.8 Michigan in March of 2008, and first at home in the Ancient Eight since a loss to Brown in April of 2005.
“If Columbia stumbles, then that’s their business,” said Fish. “Our business it just to grab every other [Ivy League] match.”
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 3
Its home winning streak snapped unceremoniously the previous day, the Crimson started Saturday’s match against the Big Red with the worst possible reaction—a lackluster display and the surrendering of the doubles point.
“The guys were really deflated from yesterday, it took a lot out of them, and we were all pained from losing something that was that close,” said Fish. “We came out at the doubles flat [and] we deserved to get beaten.”
Looking for only its second win over Harvard in 50 meetings, the Big Red gained a big boost through wins at the top two doubles. The Crimson’s No. 2 senior-sophomore combination of Sasha Ermakov and Aba Omodele-Lucien slumped to an 8-2 defeat against Cornell’s No. 2 tandem of Jeremy Feldman and Andy Gauthier, while the No. 1 duo of senior co-captain Chris Clayton and sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans lost to Kyle Doppelt and Joshua Goldstein (8-6). 
Into the singles, the Crimson knew it had to win four points to overturn the deficit and return to winning ways. It got off to the perfect start with an equalizing win at No. 5—freshman Davis Manghan, replacing the injured Ermakov, won 6-2, 6-2 against Gauthier in his Ivy League debut. A pair of gritty victories further increased the Crimson momentum; No. 3 Felton fought back to defeat Jonathan Fife (4-6, 6-1, 6-4), while the in-form No. 2 Chijoff-Evans overcame Goldstein in a 6-4, 6-4 win.
No. 6 Omodele-Lucien dropped to a (2-6, 6-3, 3-6) loss, leaving two singles points remaining, the score poised at 3-2. Fortunately for Harvard, it could count on its co-captain and No. 77 in the nation to seal the win at the No. 1 position; despite losing the first set, Clayton’s tenacity and stamina came to the fore in a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 win over Jonathan Jaklitsch.
“I think that when I went up a break in the third set, then I felt a little bit of breathing room, but not much,” said Clayton. “It was a stressful match, there’s no doubt about that.”
COLUMBIA 4 HARVARD 3
In a matchup that may yet have wider implications in the Ivy League championship race, Columbia edged a narrow win over Harvard on Friday and avenged its ECAC Tournament final loss in February—despite the Crimson claiming the doubles point and wins at the top two singles positions.
“We’re disappointed—everyone kept competing right to the end, but it wasn’t a sharp day for us,” said Fish. “[Columbia] played great…they’re a very strong team.”
An energetic Harvard started its Ivy League season impressively in the doubles. No. 2 duo Felton and Hayes secured an 8-2 win over the Lions’ Dan Urban and Rajeev Deb-Sen, followed closely by a win at No. 1 for Clayton and Chijoff-Evans over Bogdan Borta and Mihai Nichifor (8-6). No.3 Ermakov and Omodele-Lucien added gloss to the point with an 8-4 win.
With all but one of the singles matchups requiring a third set to separate the players, Columbia clawed its way back into the match with the equalizing point—a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 win for No. 2 Nichifor over Ermakov at No. 3. At No. 4, a similarly resilient Harvard performance by Felton wasn’t enough to prevent defeat—the freshman went down 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9) after a tense third-set tiebreaker with Haig Schneiderman.
At No. 5, despite saving match-points through some pinpoint passing shots, Hayes lost to Ekin Sezgen (6-3, 3-6, 6-7 (7-9)) as the Lions went within a point of victory. 
Columbia got its wish at No. 6. Against the Lions’ Deb-Sen, a tiring Omodele-Lucien fell to a 7-5, 7-6 (7-0) loss—a result greeted with triumphant roars from the Lions players and large travelling support.
“It’s disappointing—I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t [disappointing],” said Clayton. “This is just part of the Ivy League season. You never know what to expect.”
The Crimson replied in their remaining two singles at the top two courts with another set of three-set wins—No. 1 Clayton defeating Borta 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, before No. 2 Chijoff-Evans’ win over Wong (6-7, 6-4, 7-4 (7-1)).
“If anyone had said that we would win at the top two spots and win the doubles point, and not win, I wouldn’t have believed it,” said Fish.

After its first look at Ivy opponents, the Harvard men’s golf team likes where it stands in the league: right at the top.Traveling to New Haven for the Yale Spring Open, the Crimson edged out the hometown Bulldogs in Round 1 and took a decisive 10-stroke advantage in Round  2, finishing the nine-team open atop the leaderboard at 595. Yale settled for second at 610, and Dartmouth finished just behind non-conference opponent Skidmore at 614, good enough for fourth. Non-Ivy teams Hartford, Canisius, Niagara, Trinity, and Fordham also competed in the open.“It was definitely the most exciting tournament weekend we’ve had this year,” freshman Mark Pollak said. “Mainly because everyone really started coming together and playing well.”Having relied primarily on Pollak to lead the charge this season, Harvard got a big boost from its veterans, as senior John Christensen and junior Danny Mayer finished one-two. “We’ve all been working really hard on our game,” Mayer said. “I guess practice paid off this weekend...Golf’s a game where one weekend you play great and the next you play not so great.”Mayer had the daily low round in Round 1, shooting 70 on the par-70 course. But in Round 2, the Winter Park, Fla. native slipped a little, shooting 78 to finish at +8, good for second.Though he took first, Christensen trailed after Round 1, having shot two over in the first round of play. In Round 2’s competition, Christensen dropped to five over, but nobody shot par or better in Round 2, so Christensen was able to move atop the pack at +7.Junior Greg Shuman finished in a four-way tie for third, shooting 74 and 75 to finish just two strokes off the lead at +9.Captain Michael Shore etched a spot in the next batch of finishers—a trio tied at seventh—with his 75 and 76 pairing that put him at +11.In his first New England golf outting in the spring season, Pollak managed a 75 in Round 1, but slipped down to 82 strokes in Round 2 to finish at +17. The score put him in a three-way tie for 21st.“I would put a lot of the blame on the weather,” said Pollak, a native of San Antonio, Texas. “The wind was blowing really hard. It went from rain to sun to rain and sun and everything in between. It was a constant battle with Mother Nature. I started poorly and ended poorly, which really destroyed my rounds.”As a team, Harvard led the field in par-3, 4, and 5 scoring, averaging 3.32 shots on par-3s, 4.32 on par-4s, and an even 5.00 on par-5s.Shuman and Christensen tied for second in number of pars with 22, while Shore tied for the lead in par-3 scoring, shooting a flat 3.00 on par-3 holes.Proving it could compete with Yale— which, according to Mayer, is shaping up to be the frontrunner of the league—and Dartmouth, the Crimson now anticipates next weekend’s Princeton Invitational at the Springdale Golf Club to see how it can handle more Ivy League foes before the Ivy League Championships at the end of the month.“We’re hoping to use this weekend as a springboard for the rest of the season,” Pollak said. “We realize we need to keep improving. We realize that all the Ivy teams will keep improving throughout the season so we know we need to improve more.”“It’s nice to beat [Yale] initially going into Ivies,” Mayer said of the matchup with the Bulldogs that will be reprised next weekend and again at the Ivy League Championships.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

The No. 13 Harvard men’s lacrosse team travelled to Ithaca, N.Y. on Saturday to face perennial powerhouse Cornell at Schoellkopf Field. The Crimson (5-3, 1-1 Ivy) built a two-goal lead midway through the third period but could not hold on, as four unanswered scores lifted the No. 3 Big Red (7-1, 3-0 Ivy) to an eventual 13-12 victory. “We put forth a pretty good effort, but we made too many errors—sloppy errors,” co-captain Nick Smith said. The pivotal stretch began with 6:12 left in the third period after senior defenseman Max Motschwiller sent a pass to teammate Jason Duboe on the right wing, where the junior midfielder was able to give Harvard an 11-9 lead.Cornell responded in a little over a minute when Rocco Romero slipped a shot past Crimson goaltender Joe Pike. The Big Red knotted the score with just 32 seconds remaining in third period. Freshman Rob Pannell found Ryan Hurley from behind the net, one of his five assists on the day, feeding the junior five yards in front of the goal where he tied the score, 11-11.Pannell and Hurley connected again with 11:12 remaining the final period to give the Big Red its first lead since the opening minutes. An unassisted tally by Chris Finn moments later provided some insurance for Cornell.Harvard mounted a late rally, starting when Duboe assisted senior Travis Burr on a goal with 4:35 left in the match to cut the lead to one. A late turnover by the Big Red gave the Crimson a chance to tie the game with under a minute left in regulation. After calling a timeout to set up a play, the offense worked the ball around to freshman attacker Jeff Cohen. Cohen, who carried Harvard’s offense on the day, was denied by defenseman Andrew MacDonald, who blocked Cohen’s shot and cleared the ball, allowing Cornell to run out the remaining time.Cohen led the Crimson attack with his four goals, giving the freshman a team-leading 17 scores on the season. Freshman attacker Terry White and junior midfielder Jason Duboe each added two of their own.“Jeff is stepping up and being a leader,” sophomore attacker Dean Gibbons said.Cohen, White, and Duboe helped Harvard build a 6-2 lead in the first period. The Big Red got back into the game thanks to its own triumvirate of scorers—Max Seibald and Finn registered four goals apiece and Hurley notched a hat trick as well. “They have a really high-powered offense,” Smith said, “Especially Max Seibald. He’s big and strong and can shoot on the run with both hands.”Cornell cut the margin to one by halftime and tied the game, 7-7, three minutes into the third period. Harvard jumped back on top, garnering a two-goal lead on Duboe’s goal midway through the frame, before the Big Red made its charge.“Cornell is one of the best offenses in the country,” Gibbons said. “I thought our defense did a pretty good job on them.”Throughout the game, the Big Red’s attack challenged Pike. Cornell had a sizeable shot advantage over the Crimson at 50-37, but Pike managed to make a season-high 14 saves. “Joe played really well,” Smith said. “We’ve come to rely on him. He’s a force in net.”The win was the Big Red’s 11th straight victory over Harvard and its fifth straight on the season.“It was a tough game,” Gibbons said. “It’s always tough to lose a one-goal game, but we have to regroup for next week.”—Staff writer Timothy J.

Even with tri-captain Shannon Flynn on top of her game, tallying a career-high four points on three goals and an assist, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team came up short against Ivy leader Penn.The Crimson suffered an 18-9 loss to the No. 3 Quakers (10-0, 4-0 Ivy) on Saturday at Harvard Stadium.  The loss is Harvard’s second league defeat, while Penn remains undefeated in both in conference play and overall. “It was encouraging that Penn is the No. 3 team in the country and we were able to play with them,” Flynn said. “The score was not reflective of the game. It was much more of a battle than what the score leads on to be.”The Crimson held its own against the Quakers in the beginning of the game, keeping the score within a one-point margin for the first twenty minutes.After Penn scored its first goal only two minutes into the contest, freshman Tyler Petropulos answered back for Harvard, scoring two unassisted goals to bring the Crimson to one of its only two leads of the game at 2-1.  Penn placed another ball in the back of the net to tie the game at two, but Petropulos helped Harvard again minutes later with an assist on Flynn’s first goal of the game.  This marked the last time in the contest that the Crimson held an advantage.Junior tri-captain Sara Flood tallied another goal for Harvard with twelve minutes remaining in the half, off of an assist from senior Kaitlin Martin, to bring the score to 4-4.  But Penn held the Crimson scoreless for the remainder of play in the first half. “We played with them for the first 20 minutes, and then we had a lapse,” Petropulos said. Quakers Ali DeLuca and Emma Spiro paired up to score Penn’s next five goals at the end of the first half. Spiro scored off a free position shot with less than a second left in the period, bringing the score to 9-4 at the halftime whistle. Despite the late setback in the first half, Harvard continued to play at a solid pace to kick off the second frame.  While the Quakers did claim the first goal only two minutes into the second half, Harvard took charge of the game and closed the gap to just three goals within ten minutes.  Flood, Flynn, and Martin each tallied an unassisted goal in the Crimson’s last run, keeping Penn scoreless for ten minutes in the second half.  Martin’s goal was a breakaway that she picked up on the 40-yard line and ran in alone for the score. This streak brought the score to 10-7—the closest margin Harvard would see for the rest of the game.Penn put up eight more goals in the remainder of the half, and kept the Crimson to only two tallies.  Flynn added an unassisted goal and an assist, while Martin tallied the second goal.The Quakers were able to nullify sophomore leading scorer Jess Halpern, keeping her marked and scoreless all game.  Saturday’s contest ended Halpern’s 20-game scoring streak.Freshman Kerry Clark stopped 11 shots in the net, helping Harvard make a stand against Penn in the beginning of the contest.“[Clark] came up with some big saves in the beginning of the game that really helped us stay in the game,” Flynn said.The Quakers have proven themselves worthy of the No. 3 ranking this season.  The team has dominated on both offense and defense, averaging 11.62 goals per game and only allowing 4.50 goals per game.  The Crimson’s all-time series with Penn now stands at 18-18, with the Quakers taking the win for the last nine years in a row.“We weren’t going to be intimidated based on their ranking,” Petropulos said. “We knew if we could stay in structure and stick to the game plan that we would be fine. But unfortunately we didn’t do some of the things we had to do, which is why it ended up being how it was.”

For the first time since 1993, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team faced the University of Virgina. But the No. 9 Cavaliers’ (9-5, 2-3 ACC) first trip to Harvard Stadium yesterday didn’t quite go the way the Crimson (4-7, 1-2 Ivy) wanted. UVA pulled ahead early in the first half, 8-3, and despite second-half efforts by Harvard to close the gap, the Crimson came up short in a 13-9 defeat.  “UVA was the second-straight top-10 team to come here and battle with us on our turf,” sophomore Samantha McMahon said. “From the loss to Penn on Saturday, we wanted to come out fast and hard showing that we can compete with the top teams in the country.”Virginia lived up to its nationally-ranked reputation, notching the first goal of the match within the first few minutes. Harvard responded with a vengeance, scoring the next three, and after fifteen minutes of action, the Crimson led the Cavaliers, 3-1. Soon after, UVA broke through the Harvard defense to bring the game within a goal. The Crimson continued to fight, winning a draw control and putting direct pressure on the Cavalier defense. After a series of passes, UVA intercepted the ball and sped down the field for an immediate counter and goal to tie the match. Following the goal, the Cavaliers scored five more times to establish a seven-goal run in the first half. With three seconds left at the end of the period, freshman Harvard goalkeeper Kerry Clark came up big with a clutch save, keeping the game within five points at 8-3.“Going back into the second half, we sought to fight back no matter what the score may have been,” McMahon said.At the beginning of the second half, the Cavaliers came out characteristically strong, scoring a goal right away. Clark recovered with a nice save by blocking an eight-meter shot when a foul was committed in Crimson territory, and UVA was awarded free position. But after yet another quick counter by the Cavaliers, Virginia scored another goal.  Despite being down by seven, the Crimson continued to play with the Cavaliers, winning draw controls and working to keep possession of the ball.  “We were down, 10-3, at one point in the second half, and we could have caved in and thrown in the towel,” McMahon said, “but we continued to fight and hustle on the field.”Harvard senior Kaitlin Martin responded immediately after the goal by putting heavy pressure on UVA’s defense to put the ball in the back of the net.  Behind the cage, Martin challenged her opponent one-on-one—rolleing the crease on the left side and faking for a goal to make the score 10-4. Martin’s goal broke Virginia’s scoring streak and changed the tone of the game, showcasing the resilient talents of the Crimson. Harvard appeared to be re-energized, especially sophomore Jess Halpern, who bounced back from yesterday’s scoreless game against Penn to account for all of the Crimson’s last four tallies. Not only did Harvard perform on par with UVA in the second half offensively, but the Crimson also signifcantly improved defensively, giving up only three of the 13 goals in the last period.“I think that when we stayed in structure and stuck to the game plan, we were very successful and were able to score goals,” Halpern said. “Unfortunately, we had a few lapses at the end of first half and the beginning of the second that UVA capitalized on.”Harvard fought until the end, but ultimately could not overcome the Cavaliers’ early lead.“The game is 60 minutes and the mental lapses we take at certain points in the game hurt us by putting us in a hole, which is hard to get out of,” McMahon said. “Overall, had we played in structure the whole 60 minutes, then the game would have been much closer and there would be a fight for the winning goal.”

The meets may have been small, but the times posted by the Harvard track and field team this weekend made a big statement. The squad traveled to Princeton, N.J. Friday night for the Sam Howell Invitational before participating in the Penn Invitational in Philadeliphia on Saturday. The Crimson celebrated numerous accomplishments in both competitions, including two NCAA regional qualifiers, four ECAC qualifying marks, and one invitation to IC4As. Harvard athletes also notched six personal outdoor bests in meets that provided good preparation for the heart of the spring season.
“We’re just getting started with [the outdoor season], and I think people are just ready to race again,” sophomore Dan Chenoweth said.
Chenoweth and classmate Clare Richardson led the talented Crimson, finishing first and third in their respective 5000-meter races to earn NCAA bids. Junior Chas Gillespie finished 12 seconds behind Chenoweth with an IC4A qualifying time of 14:23.31, joining Richardson’s 16:50.23 as Friday’s personal bests. Despite Harvard’s strong showing in the distance events, Chenoweth insisted that the meets provided an opportunity to race in more low-key fashion.
“We were just going out with a couple of teammates and trying to run for time,” he said. “It was a different atmosphere than the indoor season, more relaxed.”
The low-pressure surroundings, it seems, inspired many of the Crimson to bring their best. Sophomore Jessica Fronk and seniors Flavia Merrit and Shannon Flahive all took first in their events—winning the javelin, 100 meters, and long jump—while freshman pole vaulter Nico Weiler and sophomore hammer thrower Eric Clayman claimed the top spots for men’s events.
Senior Dara Wilson posted a season-best 14.46 in the 100-meter hurdles as one of three Harvard competitors to finish second in an event. Sophomore Hilary May’s 800-meter performance of 2:12.86 not only marked a second-place effort, but also a new outdoor best for the sophomore. Classmate Thea Lee earned fourth in the event by dropping more than a second from her personal best with a 2:15.24. With so many quality showings early in the season, Crimson coach Jason Saretsky pointed to the effect of group mentality within the squad.
“We have good chemistry,” Saretsky said. “We have great confidence as a group. As athlete after athlete has strong performances it becomes contagious.”
Harvard runners and field athletes also appeared undaunted by the change in conditions brought on by the outdoor season. Not only must athletes contend with wind and other weather conditions, but the spring season also takes place primarily on the road.
“One of the biggest differences [between indoor and outdoor track] is the elements,” Saretsky said. “The second biggest factor is the fact that we’re on the road, without the comforts of being at home. It’s a different mindset, but the team responded well.”
Even Crimson competitors who did not log top finishes found themselves rewarded. Freshman Kailyn Kuzmuk and sophomore Jamie Olson finished fourth and fifth respectively in the 1500-meter—separated by only .38 seconds—while rookie Nicole Cochran took eighth in 4:39.15. All three times proved sufficient to qualify for ECACs, as was the time of the women’s 4x100-meter relay, which posted a second place finish in 48.30.
Although Saretsky appreciated the opportunity for individuals to post strong times in a relaxed environment, the head coach placed particular emphasis on the chance to become familiar with Penn’s track, which will host the Ivy league’s biggest race in May.
“There were some strong performances and I was really glad with the [effort],” Saretsky said. “The team really benefitted from being down at Penn when it wasn’t the Penn Relays, because it helped us to prepare for Heps.”

Harvard’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams opened their seasons this weekend, and both teams turned in strong performances. Racing in San Diego, the heavyweight team captured two top-three finishes, while the lightweight team was able to hold off ranked opponents Cornell, Penn, Georgetown, and Columbia in D.C. to begin the season 4-0. 
In their first races of the spring season, the heavyweight team turned in a third-place finish at the San Diego Crew Classic.   
Competing in the prestigious Copley Cup, the varsity eight clocked in at a time of 5:53.95, which was narrowly behind first-place California (5:51.8) and second-place Washington (5:52.61). Stanford finished fourth in the race. 
The second varsity eight competed in the Sharp Cabrillo Cup, which the squad had won last year. The Crimson, however, finished third, with Cal, Washington and Stanford finishing first, second, and fourth, respectively, to mirror the top-four of the Copley Cup. 
“We were very aggressive today,” sophomore Chris Kingston said. “Considering that it is early in the season, we were delighted with our form.” 
“It was an early test for us,” captain Teddy Schreck added. “It was a good opportunity to see the crews we’ll be competing against later on for the national championship...We had encouraging results, and it is nice to show this speed early on in the season. 
Senior Simon Gawlik added that there were “perfect conditions,” with good tail winds, and expressed how excited the team was to be able to compete in San Diego. 
“We are very thankful we get to go here,” Gawlik said of San Diego. “Of course it would not be possible without our generous donors and organizers. It’s awesome to be here and nice to have a little break from Cambridge.” 
The team’s next race is April 11, when it hosts Brown in the Stein Cup. 
The fifth-ranked lightweight crew team began its dual racing season Saturday by finishing 4-0. Against fourth-ranked Cornell and ninth-ranked Penn, Harvard won two of five races. The Crimson swept both sixth-ranked Georgetown and seventh-ranked Columbia.   
In the first race of the day, against Cornell and Penn, extreme winds on the Schuylkill River forced the race to change from the dual racing format to a single-file 2,000-meter time trial that was run upriver. 
“The conditions were pretty rough,” junior Martin Eiermann said. “But every single boat handled it well.” 
The varsity eight won its race with a time of 6:22.2. Cornell, the two-time defending champions, finished second (6:31.3), followed by Penn in third (6:39). 
The second and third varsity eights both finished second, behind Cornell, in their races. The first freshman eight won its race, while the second freshman eight placed second, also behind Cornell. 
“It was nice to see the freshman do very well,” Eiermann said. “They had a very solid performance.” 
In the second race of the day, against Georgetown and Columbia, Harvard’s varsity eight finished in first-place, with a time of 6:14.5, ahead of second-place Georgetown by more than four seconds.  Columbia finished the race in third-place, but was 25 seconds off the Crimson’s winning time. 
For Harvard’s second varsity eight, the race results were nearly identical to the first team’s. The Crimson won the race in 6:10.2, which was, once again, four seconds better than Georgetown and 25 seconds better than Columbia.
Overall, the squad was pleased with its first running of the season. “It was good to kick the season off on the right foot,” senior Stephen Barchick said. 
“We were really solid,” Eiermann added. “We did a lot of work over spring break—we all stayed in Cambridge—and you could really see that paying off.” 
The next race for Harvard’s lightweight team is April 11, when the Crimson hosts Dartmouth and M.I.T. in the Biglin Cup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In sports, there are two types of losses. The first scenario involves the outright defeat—a game in which an insurmountable distance lies between a team and victory. In the second type, only a few plays decide which team takes home the W and which is just a viable competitor.On Saturday, the Harvard women’s water polo team experienced both types of defeat.The Crimson (9-11, 2-3 CWPA) dropped a 16-6 loss to No. 12 Hartwick (23-11, 5-1) early Saturday afternoon. Hours later, Harvard’s matchup with Brown (17-12, 4-1) was still undecided through the final minute, but the Bears ultimately clawed out an 11-10 win.Sunday saw a reversal of roles, as the women’s squad trounced Utica (2-8, 0-5) and Connecticut College (2-3, 2-3) 19-2 and 23-4, respectively.The Crimson will have the chance to prove itself as more than just a viable competitor against Brown again next Saturday in Norton, Mass.“They’re a rival and they need to be knocked off,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said. “We definitely would like to return the favor in their temporary home pool next Saturday.”   HARVARD 23, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 4The Crimson ended the weekend on a strong note by pummeling the Camels, 23-4. Freshman Monica Zdrojewski led the offensive charge with five goals that were complemented by co-captain Devon MacLaughlin’s three tallies and five ejections.Freshmen Devan Kennifer and Ita Barton-Kettleborough joined the duo by adding their own hat tricks. A total of 11 Harvard players scored on Connecticut, which was also shut out in the second half of the game. 	HARVARD 19, UTICA 2Harvard took charge early and led by a dozen at halftime. The team’s sophomores had a field day against the Pioneers, as Patricia Smith, Shami Entenman and Natasha Whitney, a Crimson news writer, all registered hat tricks. The Crimson maintained stalwart defensive play, as well. Freshman netminder Laurel McCarthy racked up nine saves against the Pioneers and had 14 on the day.Compared to Saturday’s games—especially the contest against Hartwick—the Crimson underwent an about-face in its play, taking complete control in the games on Sunday.  “This time of year teams change very quickly,” Farrar said.BROWN 11, HARVARD 10In the team’s final home game of the season, the Crimson stumbled out of the gate. Two exclusions and a Brown penalty shot provided the basis for an early 4-0 deficit. But Harvard refused to let the second match of the day go the way of the first and quickly turned the tide around.“We did a great job of digging ourselves out of that hole,” Farrar said. “And it was game on from there.”With the score at 4-3, the Crimson utilized back-to-back Kennifer goals to round out a 5-0 run. Kennifer contributed five goals throughout the game. The two teams jostled for the lead throughout the second half. Although Harvard held a 10-8 advantage to start the fourth, Brown’s offense amped up its tempo down the stretch and grabbed an 11-10 lead with two minutes to go. The Crimson had one last opportunity to tie the game up with 34 seconds remaining. Zdrojewski got the ball inside to MacLaughlin, but a defender forced her to foul. Brown retook possession and waited out the clock to take the 11-10 victory. “Brown-Harvard is a classic rivalry, so it always brings out a higher level in each team,” Farrar said. “They did a good job of closing the deal.” HARTWICK 16, HARVARD 6The first game of the weekend proved to be a challenging one. The Hawks sped out to 7-0 lead and held Harvard scoreless until 2:20 remained in the first half when Smith drove the ball into the Hartwick goal from midrange. The Hawks quickly responded at the other end of the pool, regaining their seven-point lead.“The other team came out a little bit more intensely and we didn’t react to that from the get-go,” Zdrojewski said. “We have many opportunities to play Hartwick again and so we’re going to use that as a learning experience.”The Crimson offense found difficulty establishing a steady rhythm, especially at center.“We weren’t making enough space for either of the [centers] in the first game,” Farrar said. “They were just blindly throwing the ball into a fluffing defense with predictably unpleasant results.”The Hartwick attack, on the other hand, fired on all cylinders. Despite eight saves from co-captain Nicola Perlman, who is also a former Crimson magazine chair, the Hawks closed out the game with a double digit lead at 16-6. Regardless of the result, each player ended the day a big smile as the team celebrated the final home games of its two seniors, Perlman and MacLaughlin.“When you’re starting five freshmen, you need even more from your leaders,” Farrar said. “They’ve done a fantastic job…They will be sorely missed.”—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though adverse conditions forced the cancellation of the Radcliffe heavyweight crew’s dual-race against Brown, the lightweight crew were the champs of the Potomac, sweeping both races against Georgetown in Washington D.C. to win the Class of 2004 Cup.Both boats emerged victorious over Georgetown for No. 5 Radcliffe despite windy and wavy conditions out on the river.Rowing on the Potomac in April is no joke, as the winds—reaching as high as 25 miles per hour—and currents made even rowing in a straight line far from simple.“The conditions were extreme,” junior Grace Hallowell said. “I don’t think we’ve ever raced in anything like that. There were 20-25 mile-per-hour wins and it was difficult getting aligned at the start.”Competing against the elements challenged the Black and White’s rowers to maintain composure and strong fundamentals, but Radcliffe’s practice appears to be paying off.“In these conditions, you have to say composed and stick to the practice and techniques,” junior Medha Khandelwhal said. “It’s easy to get flustered and let your technique go downhill and let the situation overwhelm you, but we did a good job taking control.”The second varsity eight scored the first victory of the day, topping the Hoyas by 3.9 seconds with a finishing time of 6:37. Both teams were in the race from the start, and neither was able to gain an advantage in the first 1000 meters. “Around the 1000-meter mark, we started moving away from them and then finished off the race trying to get as big a lead as we could,” Khandelwal said.The victory displayed the depth of the Black and White’s team and gave the varsity eight a confidence boost before the second race of the day.“The 2-V has been really strong, especially this week and they’ve been moving well together in practice,” Hallowell said. “They found their rhythm and found what they needed. I think it’s really good for the team to see us winning in both boats.”The varsity eight overcame an early Georgetown lead during the first 250 meters and used the middle 1000 meters to open up the lead by more than a boat-length. From there, Radcliffe never looked back, crossing the finish line a comfortable 6.4 seconds ahead of Georgetown with a finish time 6:22.“Both boats stayed really composed and rowed a really good race and showed all the work that we put in this season,” Khandelwal said.The victory over the Hoyas gives the Black and White its first significant win of the year against a top national opponent and returns the Class of 2004 Cup to Radcliffe for the first time since 2006.“Georgetown is always a really fast team,” Hallowell said. “Especially in the last couple years, they’ve gotten really fast. Last year, they were in the top at IRA and the year before that. Since I’ve been here, we haven’t won the Cup, and it was really exciting to finally bring it back this year.”The No. 10 Radcliffe heavyweight crew’s first opportunity for timed competition did not materialize this weekend thanks to unfavorable conditions on the Charles River Basin. Originally scheduled as a dual meet, the race moved upstream and was run as an untimed event. Rowing from the BU Bridge back towards Harvard to finish at the Weeks Bridge, the Black and White raced five varsity boats as well as the novice squad, while six varsity crews from Brown also raced the course, where headwinds and crosswinds proved challenging to navigate.The heavyweight crew team will compete against Princeton and Cornell next Saturday while the lightweights travel to Camden, New Jersey this weekend for the Knecht Cup, which will feature over 50 crews from schools across the country.  —Staff writer Robert T.

Few of us ever remember that chunk of time between the joyous opening of the Harvard acceptance email and the awkward and uninhibited arrival of pre-frosh weekend. But Flyby can recall getting a certain uncomfortable congratulatory/inquisitive phone call one ripe April afternoon that went a little something like this.
Flyby: "Hello?"
Random Harvard Undergrad: "Hi!  Congratulations on getting into Harvard!"
Flyby: "Oh...thanks!"
Random Harvard Undergrad: "Do you have any questions about academics, extracurricular activities, or life at Harvard in general?!"
Flyby: "Uh...no?"
Come to find out, that was the work of the Undergraduate Admissions Council, which holds a phone-a-thon—staffed by volunteers—every year.  Today, Flyby  jumped at the chance to chat up some pre-frosh and answer the pressing questions of the next generation of the brightest and best students in the nation.
As everyone settled down at the phones, one girl squealed, “I’m scared to call!”  Flyby wonders why she volunteered to take part in a phone-a-thon.
Vanessa Duran, who was in charge of the event, reassured her, saying, “They’re probably more scared of you than you are of them.”
Most of the pre-frosh were nice but didn't have anything interesting to say.  Occasionally, parents picked up and didn’t give Flyby a chance to say much:
Flyby: “Hi, this is—”
Irritated Parent: “Who?”
Eventually, Flyby started eavesdropping on other people’s conversations.
One guy told a pre-frosh that the “dining hall food is really tasty.”  Well, if your idea of “tasty” is various types of rice pilaf
mass-produced for over a thousand freshmen.
Another girl explained “All the freshmen live in the yard…Harvard takes the time to match you up with a good roommate, so you’ll get along really well…no matter where you get assigned, you’ll love it!” That’s right, don’t tell them about the Union dorms yet.  They’ll find out soon enough in August, when they rip open their dorm assignments and wonder what ‘Hurlbut’ means.
Later, Flyby asked Duran and other members of the Undergraduate Admissions Council about the kinds of responses they have gotten from pre-frosh.  Here’s a sampling:
“Is there a strong population that enjoys medieval music?”
“Do Harvard students have fun?”
“Are you getting paid for this?”
“I’m coming next week.  You’re going to give me a tour.”
“Tell me about Harvard Medical (or Law) School.  How can I increase my chances of getting in?”
“Convince my child!” (from a parent)
“Where’s the nearest bowling alley?”
“I got in?  I got in?  Haha, just kidding, I already knew.”

Takemura, the popular sushi outlet in Cambridge, has a new special—and it's got a nice political bent to it.
For $12.95, you can order "Obama Maki," a feast of shrimp tempura, cucumber, lobster, and spicy mayo. There must be no situation more ideal than dousing some Obama Maki in wasabi-tinged soy sauce, stuffing it into your mouth, and feeling patriotic all at the same time. We are quite pleased by the idea.
So we called up the place and had a nice conversation with "David," a waiter who seemed utterly puzzled by our interest in the Obama Maki. See the conversation after the jump:
FlyBy: So...why is this dish called "Obama Maki?" [And why did the receptionist just hand the phone over to a waiter? Hello, owner? Manager?]
David: "I don't really know. The owner created the rolls so I just don't know what she thought. She just made it up. At the time, Obama was a pretty big issue." [Yeah, I guess he's important.]
FlyBy: "Oh yeah, Obama...is there any direct correlation between its ingredients and its name? You know, the way it looks....and it's named after Obama..." [Ahem.]
David: "Just the name, it's Obama Maki. There's nothing really special about it." [Oh. Boring. Maybe should have been McCain maki? Kerry maki? C'mon David, you're killing me.]
FlyBy: "Does it taste good?" [I mean, $12.95 is a little steep...]
David: "I think so. I think it's pretty nice." [And so articulate!]
Several awkward revelations later, the truth finally emerged:
David: "I guess the owner wants to sell as many as possible...She's using his name in order to make the business better. He's still an issue." [Okay, maybe not such a great deal after all. Bye David. I think I'll just go for some of this. At least it looks like Obama.]

What’s the four letter word uttered by almost everyone who entered Science Center C today for the Boston Crossword Puzzle Tournament?
“Whoa!”
Yeah, that answer surprised us too. The lecture hall was packed almost to capacity with a handful of undergraduates and an overwhelming number of crossword enthusiasts from the Boston area, easily identified by graying hair, thick glasses, and/or crossword paraphernalia.  One woman wore a crossword grid scarf.  Another carried a crossword grid tote bag. Flyby began to feel a little boxed in by all the black-and-white squares.
Read on after the jump, as we test our vocab and talk to the most puzzling personality in crosswords.
The tournament ran from 1-3 p.m., during which competitors completed four different puzzles, which would be judged based on accuracy and time.  Each puzzle had to be completed in under 25 minutes, depending on its difficulty level.
Curious, Flyby picked up the first puzzle but sadly couldn't piece together any of the answers.  Our vocabulary was bolstered just by staring at the page, though—did you know that Iditarod and syzygy are actual words?
After the competition, Will Shortz—the New York Times crossword puzzle editor and the man who introduced Sudoku to America—gave a short talk about his favorite crossword puzzle experiences.  Flyby slowly realized, as the audience responded to Shortz with roars of laughter and knowing shouts of approval, that we were in the presence of a cruciverbalist god.
After the awards ceremony, Flyby barreled through the crowd to shake Shortz’ hand and ask him what advice he’d give to novice puzzlers.
He said that a good crossword solver had to have a “natural bent” towards puzzles, and that “good crossword puzzlers know a little bit about everything.”  Regarding Sudoku and kenken, Shortz’s newest obsession, he said, “I love the simplicity of the instructions and the great depth of techniques to solve them.  Each still has a mystery to it and that’s nice.”
At this point, Flyby could sense that the actual cruciverbalists, growing impatient, were closing in.   We elected to leave them to their king.

Sometimes, your jokes are just too good to not take credit for. Or, at least, you want everyone to know that you think so.
