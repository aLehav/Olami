After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Changing the calendar has been tricky. With the first academic year under the newly reformed calendar nearly halfway complete, students have begun to absorb its implications, and an unintended consequence of calendar change has emerged—namely, the end of the semester has become considerably more stressful for students than in previous years. Given that one often-cited goal of calendar reform was to reduce student stress, this is an issue that the administration ought to seriously address when fine-tuning the calendar for future years.
The foremost problem with this current calendar phase is simply that reading period has become truncated. Last year’s fall reading period, excluding winter break, was ten days long. By contrast, this year’s reading period is only one week long—a full three days shorter. For many, this adjustment resulted in a far more hectic Thanksgiving recess than in years past, as students faced returning from break with fast-approaching paper due dates and impending exams. In the past, this arrangement would not be such a problem (the spring semester has always transitioned from classes directly into reading and exam period), but because reading period has been shortened from ten days to seven days in both the fall and spring semesters, the term-end transition has become significantly more stressful.
One potential response to the stresses of a shorter reading period would be for professors to avoid assigning the heavy workloads at the end of the fall semester that would have been manageable under the old calendar, and instead opt to distribute the workload more evenly throughout the semester. Too many professors this fall maintained their old syllabi structures without considering the potential impact of calendar reform on end-of-term student workloads.
Of course, we recognize that larger academic assignments such as papers and projects will inevitably pile up at the end of the semester. Yet students suffer even more from a shorter reading period because professors are not allowed to assign paper deadlines during exam period.  This means that all papers must be completed before the end of reading period, rather than having this work more spread out. In light of the condensed reading period, professors should be given the flexibility to set paper deadlines during exam period—a paper due during exam period is much preferable to a premature deadline.
Overall, we recognize that the new calendar has many benefits, not least the rescheduling of exams before winter recess. The implementation, however, has not been perfect, and specific flaws require sincere attention from the administration going forward.

Seventy-five dollars is a lot of money. It can get you 68 purchases on the McDonald’s dollar menu, 44 trips on the subway with a CharlieCard, 37 loads of clean laundry, 15 one-scoop waffle cones at JP Licks, a full magical day of fun at Disneyland, or maybe even a flight home. This sum is also the amount that students are charged on their termbills each semester by Harvard to fund student groups and support the activities of the Undergraduate Council.
Although funding for the UC promotes opportunities for undergraduates to enhance college life and advocate for changes in curricular, extracurricular, and residential policy, the fee should not be included in the termbill. Only fees for mandatory items—such as tuition and room and board—should be automatically charged. Students should have the option of including extra fees on their termbill, such as the UC fee, only if they so choose.
As it stands now, however, the UC fee automatically appears on every termbill, placing the burden on students to remove it—that is, if they’re even aware that it can be removed. This strategy smacks of disingenuousness, akin to burying the unsavory conditions of a business agreement in fine print. It puts undue stress on students with financial hardships who have to scramble to make sure they aren’t making unnecessary payments. Even more outrageously, students are required by the Student Receivables Office to submit a letter if they wish to waive the fee. Those who do not want to or cannot support the UC because of personal or financial reasons should not have to go through the hassle of writing this letter, buying the envelope and stamps for mailing it, and taking the time to deliver it personally.
If SRO administrators do insist on placing the UC fee onto the termbill, however, the least they can do is make more of an effort to inform students that waiving it is in fact an option. The College makes a commendable effort through e-mail and letters to inform students that the Harvard University Student Health Plan Supplemental can be waived. Although the HUSHP Supplemental is optional, it still deserves to be part of the termbill because, unlike the UC fee, it is necessary. Before the College knows whether a student has adequate health insurance, it is reasonable to first charge students with the fee in case of a life-threatening emergency. Since the UC fee does not carry such importance, the SRO has an even greater obligation to either ensure that students are aware that the fee is optional or remove it from the termbill altogether.
This is not to say that the College should not support the UC. Like many student clubs, the UC can charge students who wish to be active members of the UC. The UC can even encourage students to pay the fee by means of e-mails, door-to-door visits, letters, and posters. However, an optional fee is only optional if students are aware of their options. The SRO needs to change the method of charging UC fees so that it does not trouble students and reflect badly on the College. Besides, the last thing Harvard wants is for disgruntled students to realize too late that, instead of investing in the UC, they could have bought comfy, warm clothing and boots for the chilly winter drawing ever nearer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, 32 young Americans won Rhodes Scholarships. Their tenures at Oxford are funded by the legacy of the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, a man whose life would not be honored today were it not for his scholarships—and specifically his vision that young people of outstanding intellect, leadership, and ambition could make the world a better place.
For over a century Rhodes Scholars have left Oxford to begin their careers. Given their records, virtually any jobs have been available to them. For most of that history, they have overwhelmingly chosen paths in scholarship, teaching, writing, medicine, scientific research, law, and military and public service. They have reached the highest levels in virtually all fields, from prize-winning novelists to a U.S. president.
But in the ’80s, the pattern of career choices began to change. Until then, even though business ambitions and management degrees have not been disfavored in our competition, business careers attracted relatively few Rhodes Scholars, and it was the rare scholar who went to Wall Street or to finance. No one argued this an unfit or unworthy domain for Rhodes Scholars; it was simply on few scholars’ radar. And those who did make such a choice, including myself, usually did so after beginning a different career. Only three of the 320 American Rhodes Scholars in the ’70s went directly into business from Oxford; by the late ’80s the number grew to that many each year. And, recently, more than twice as many entered that field in just one year as did in the entire decade of the ’70s.
This break in an almost century-old pattern coincided with great increases in occupational earnings differentials, which have continued to grow, seemingly exponentially. It seems quaint, if not unfathomable, that just three decades ago the differentials that then existed—generally two- to fivefold in earnings between business leaders and doctors and lawyers, or five- to tenfold with professors, scientists, and public servants—were often rationalized by the country’s highest-ranking graduates as reasonable additional compensation to balance the lower standing of business jobs among their peers.
When differentials could become a hundredfold or even far more—and as investment banking and similar firms started actively to recruit young Rhodes Scholars who earned degrees in math, physics, and even history, English, and theology—the yawning prospective-wealth chasm became impossible for many to ignore. Even for a few of those most deeply committed to other, more public-spirited pursuits—whether in laboratories, classrooms, poor neighborhoods, charter schools, the media, or state legislatures—the lure of such rewards, especially as they are reasonably attainable for people of such high abilities, became hard to resist. Most Rhodes Scholars who don’t have a passion for the most remunerative careers (when one cannot fairly quarrel) still do resist, but they tell me it gets harder every year.
So what is the matter with this picture?
Nothing—if one believes that such differentials are necessary for our economic system to thrive. But do many believe that differentials need be this grotesquely large to incentivize and reward people adequately, if not richly? No; they are that large today simply because they can be that large, not because of some virtuous working of the market. This is not Adam Smith’s capitalism. Just as he decried the inevitable greed and corruption of monopoly, he would surely rail against today’s self-serving and closed systems of compensation review.
Nothing—if one believes that changed career paths of a few privileged people is of no larger significance. But some have gifts that realistically could be expected to lead to world-changing breakthroughs, cures, or innovations; greater respect for politics; even to hundreds of profoundly moved and inspired students. Moreover, this reflects something far more pervasive. Consider President Drew G. Faust’s recent laments for the increasingly material, instrumental ambitions of so many of her students. She has noted the steep national decline in the percentage of students majoring in liberal arts and sciences since the 1970s, with a dramatic rise in undergraduate interest in business. At Harvard, economics attracts a higher percentage of students than any other field.
Does anyone seriously believe that the social benefits, macroeconomic included, that can be expected as a collective consequence of radically more remunerative paths taken will be as great or greater than would have followed from those, mentioned above, not taken? Isn’t the innovation that the country needs most for continued prosperity likely to come from scientists and engineers, not leaders of financial institutions?
And there is nothing wrong if one believes the rules and practices of corporate governance are adequate to assure reasonable compensation practices. But can anyone maintain they do, given the undemocratic ways in which corporate directors are chosen and elected, and the myriad examples of executive compensation perversely related to shareholder return?
Or perhaps if one believes the fabric of our democracy might not be frayed by a steadily widening gap between the very rich and the middle class—a gap that could become as cavernous as it currently appears in some of the world’s least harmonious and most dispiriting countries.
And the last explanation: if one believes that 10 or 20 years down business career tracks, when going back to earlier ambitions is rarely possible, those choices will be the ones that have created the greatest happiness for those individuals.
Many thought a silver lining of last year’s financial crisis—or from the populist rage that flared against Wall Street excess and profits from leverage, not creativity—would be that earnings differentials would return from obscene to merely enormous levels, if not to the very generous multiples that had long been adequate to fuel a vibrant economy. Well, the hyper-bonuses are back—astonishingly having been made even easier to achieve with taxpayers socializing the downside risks. And the crisis? What crisis?
So how many more of America’s young and brightest will ask themselves what kind of chumps they are to give up the chance to earn 100 or 500 times more than their mentors, their doctors, their favorite professors, their idols and heroes?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many years ago, when an older friend e-mailed to debrief me on his first few days living in Weld Hall, he quipped: “I woke up today to the sound of a tour guide outside my window, explaining that this is where freshmen at Harvard live. I’ll never visit a zoo again.” Little did I know that in just a few years, my issues with volume control and freakish levels of enthusiasm would lead me to join the Crimson Key Society, and I would find myself leading throngs of wide-eyed Asian tourists throughout Harvard Yard. The first few tours I gave were incredibly unnerving. I worried I’d slip up on a date or be faced with an obscure question from the tourist equivalent of “that kid in section.” But the nerves faded as I came to a realization, one that I’ve passed on to many a younger keyster. “You’re a Harvard student,” I remind them. “These tourists want to like you.”
In his Dec. 1 column “I Go to Harvard. FML.”, Brian J. Bolduc ’10 denounced one of Harvard’s nearest and dearest traditions. “Students target the figure, whose shoe tourists rub for good luck, because it symbolizes their success,” he wrote. “But when we disrespect this institution, we disrespect ourselves. Revelry in other people’s misery, public urination, and embarrassment over your affiliation are undignified.” As an expert on undignified behavior, I’m hardly in a position to comment on the appropriate comportment of members of the intellectual elite. I will, however, join Bolduc in condemning this tradition. Not because it’s disrespectful to this institution, or to ourselves, but because it’s disrespectful to individuals who travel to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for an hour-long glimpse into our ever-so-privileged lives.
Although a score of Crimson op-eds have highlighted the perils of “the Harvard bubble” in which we live, most fail to mention one of the most unsettling aspects of our seclusion. More often than not, we forget that the prestige that drew us here is the same prestige we benefit from daily in the profound lectures we attend and the vast resources we have access to. Yet when we are reminded of our world-class reputation, we very rarely consider it through the lens of an outsider.
The context in which we interact with the flocks of foreigners who congregate in the yard to take their picture with John Harvard or point an awe-struck finger toward Widener Library is usually one of inconvenience. They impose on our isolation unapologetically. Many days, they are the Harvard student’s sole, albeit limited, contact with the outside world. The relationship is, unsurprisingly, antagonistic. Clad in Harvard sweatshirts, we scoff at the tourists as we’re forced to walk around them on our way to class. The most aggressive amongst them even dare to hand us a camera as they pose eagerly in front of the Science Center.
Yet the tourists can represent so much more. Piled up behind problem sets and complaining about the dating scene, or lack thereof, at our ivy-covered institution, it’s easy to take our place here for granted. It’s easier still to forget that, in the international community, Harvard is just that: an institution. It is not just another name in a pile of applications or another campus to visit. It is a beacon of educational excellence and a pinnacle of achievement, and it’s no surprise that the occasional tour group wants to admire its buildings, and sometimes its students.
It’s true that the very idea of being observed can feel unnerving, particularly when it manifests in a way that sticks out like a sore thumb, in the form of strangers who share neither our language nor our culture. But we at Harvard are hardly caged animals. In these four years, and for the rest of our lives, we stand a great deal to gain from the Harvard name. It’s also more than fair to assert that we were by no means backed into a corner when we settled on Harvard College. We all had options, but we all came to the school that offered a tradition of excellence and a wealth of opportunity. And this, in addition to about $30,000 of tuition a year, is the price we pay.
More importantly, we must recognize the desirability of a value system that places an institution of higher learning up there with art museums and natural landmarks on a list of must-see tourist destinations. The notion that spending a day touring an elite college is not only important, but fun, deserves encouragement, not disdain. If I’ve learned anything during my four years here, it’s that Harvard students have no shortage of undignified outlets through which to disrespect themselves. Next time, don’t rain on my tour group’s parade.

Last night marked the start of Harvard Business School’s first Alumni New Ventures Contest, which will award $25,000 cash to one team of entrepreneurs in April.
Over sixty participants packed Hawes Lecture Hall for the initial meeting, where they learned that the contest requires teams to propose novel start-up companies and compete to prove their idea is the best. Teams must include at least one Harvard Business School alum.
The three-hour event began with a brief period of networking time, followed by a panel discussion on the trials of starting new ventures. Panelists included Keith W. Cooper ’83, President and Chief Operating Officer of Carbonite, an online file protection service; Graham Lubie, co-founder of Celarix, an early leader in internet software; and Furqan Nazeeri, founder of several ventures including Pivot, Inc., an instant messaging platform for Wall Street traders.
Panelists expressed optimism in the face of the business challenges posed by the economic crisis.
Nazeeri said it was a “great time for recruiting talent, and vendor pricing will be as low as it will ever be.”
He added that it would be hard to raise capital. Cooper, while not discouraging new business efforts, said that now was “not a good time for new ideas.”
“You should make something that has already been done easier, or cheaper, or faster,” he said.
Dubie downplayed the influence of financial climates in general.
“There’s never a good time or a bad time,” he said. “It’s not so much a matter of the climate as it is of the need.”
Further panel discussion ran the gamut from start-up advice and prospects to hiring practices to business regulation legislation to past business successes and failures.
Following the panel, contest organizers outlined the competition and invited competitors to start pitching.
Each start-up pitch was limited to one minute, in which time presenters had to state their business vision and what sort of investment and management they would require. The pitches catered to a variety of needs. Suggestions ranged from a Web site offering virtual career experiences, to a device that would automatically alert a call center when the elderly wearer falls, to online video cooking technique demonstrations.

Cambridge School Committee members discussed structuring the Cambridge Public School District’s budget to best improve student achievement during a Budget Sub-Committee meeting last night.
The meeting was held to review a one-page budget guideline for Fiscal Year 2011 introduced by school committee members Marc C. McGovern and Patricia M. Nolan ’80.
“Tough economic times will mean tough choices,” McGovern said, adding that the guidelines presented a way of making those choices. Cambridge spends about twice as much per pupil as other districts in the state, but the most recent Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) results show that the district suffers from a significant black-white achievement gap and scores well below the state average.
McGovern and Nolan suggested that the committee work toward closing achievement gaps by addressing the specific needs of different socio-economic groups, as well as under-performing schools over the coming school year.
The guidelines also emphasized closely evaluating the effectiveness of programs funded by the school.
“What we are not good at is checking whether our program is effective,” said Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons.
Committee members expressed diverging opinions of how achievement should be evaluated.
“There’s no MCAS for ethical behavior or kindness. But, there are some areas that can be seen, measured, and even counted,” said Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young.
Committee member Nancy Tauber called for focus not only on underperformance and state test results but also on communication skills and global experience.
In addition to achievement, the guideline discussed special education, middle grades, school climate, technologies, and operations.
Committee members said they were concerned that many of these categories overlapped, although they said in general the guideline was clear and well structured, and therefore more accessible to the public than previous drafts.
“[The guideline] clearly integrated the comments that we got from previous meetings and the format is more direct,” said committee member Luc D. Schuster.
But some members cautioned against attempting more new measures than necessary.
“It would not be a sin for the guideline to stay similar to the one from the previous year,” Simmons said. “Don’t always reinvent the wheel.”
This guideline will be voted on at the next meeting on Dec. 15.

Dominique D. Winters, a third-year student at the Law School, spent last summer working at the Washington, D.C. public defender’s office, having foresaken more profitable firm jobs in order to improve what she says is a deeply flawed criminal justice system.
To support her work, Winters said she relied on the Law School’s Summer Public Interest Funding (SPIF), which financially supported her for 10 weeks.
But that funding may not be as widely available or generous to law students anymore.
On Monday, the Law School announced that it will reduce the amount of funding SPIF provides from 10 weeks of financial backing to eight for students wishing to pursue public interest law during the summer.
In addition, the Law School will suspend its Public Service Initiative (PSI), a program that waives the third-year’s tuition if a student commits to five years of public interest work after graduating.
Countering those cuts, Law School Dean Martha Minow pledged to increase total financial aid spending, and said HLS will extend its general loan forgiveness program to more of its graduates.
Law School students interviewed yesterday expressed discontent that HLS chose to make cuts to programs that directly affect students’ abilities to enter public interest careers. But they also said they appreciated the Law School’s decision to keep large parts of the program intact.
“The cuts are largely reasonable, but I’m disappointed they decided to go to eight weeks of funding,” said Reuben A. Rodriguez, a second-year student who spent 11 weeks last summer in a public interest position.
“Eight weeks seem short,” he added.
In an e-mail to the student body Monday, Minow wrote that though HLS will allow students already enrolled in PSI to continue in the program, it is “not likely to extend it to future incoming classes.”
Students yesterday said they were less concerned over the suspension of the PSI.
Benjamin M. Sadun, a first-year student, said he was pleased that the Law School administration had decided to honor its commitments to those students who are already enrolled in the program.
Lauren N. Moore, another first-year, said the suspension had little impact on students in her year and therefore was not of great concern to her.
Winters—the student who spent her summer in Washington, D.C.—said that students who want to do public interest work in metropolitan areas like Washington and New York might be strapped for funds under the new system if they pursue work in areas with high costs of living.
In an interview Monday, Alexa Shabecoff, the Law School’s assistant dean for public service, said she has encouraged students to seek alternate legal markets. She noted that she had started her own legal career in St. Louis and was able to live comfortably there on a public interest salary.
“We can’t preserve 10 weeks of funding for some students by making funding unavailable for others,” wrote the Law School’s spokesman Robert L. J. London in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson.
London added that HLS will work with students to craft employment around eight weeks of funding and that SPIF allows students to receive income from outside sources wihtout decreasing their SPIF grant.
But Winters, who is in the final stage of interviews for a position at a public defender’s office, expressed concern yesterday that the new system might negatively impact the employment prospects of students dependent on funding. Students who seek public interest positions after graduation often work longer stints over the summer in the hopes of making an impression on their employer, but that might not be possible with limited funds, Winters said.
“But this probably won’t adversely affect students with a genuine interest in public interest law,” she said. “I would do this regardless of whether I had funding.”

Having a Twitter account certainly leads to procrastination, but it may also lead to increased social interaction in the real world, according to Dr. Reynol Junco, an associate professor at Lock Haven University in Pennsylvania.
In a talk at Harvard Law School yesterday afternoon, Junco discussed his ongoing study, which aims to discover whether participation in on-line social networks like Twitter causes increased participation in real world settings like the classroom.
“We’re looking at the effects of Twitter on student engagement and student success,” said Junco, who has also written books about the use of technology in education.
Junco said that he used to list his instant messenger screen name on the syllabus for his classes.
“I found that students, especially introverted first-years, became more comfortable and compelled to participate in class after interacting with me on-line,” Junco related.
The current study, which he has been  conducting at an undisclosed college since September, is focused on first-year students, all of whom are health pre-professionals taking a seminar about their chosen career path.
Researchers divided the students into seven groups, four of which were given Twitter accounts at the beginning of the semester and encouraged to tweet.
He called Twitter a “safe bet” and said it is not as widely utilized as other social  networking sites like Facebook.
“Twitter doesn’t have a stigma,” said Junco. “It is much more public and less revealing than other sites.”
At the start of the study, Junco and his colleagues sent out a survey asking students to rate on a four point scale their level of social engagement both inside and outside the classroom.
They sent the survey again this past Monday, and will use the students’ answers and ratings of their engagement by faculty and teaching assistants to see if any increase in participation occurred.
The researchers are also coding all the students’ tweets into four categories­—supportive, release, academic, and co-curricular involvement—to understand how the students’ utilized their Twitter accounts. Students’ tweets ranged from expressing concern over what another student had tweeted to asking a question about a homework assignment, Junco said.
“Based on what I’ve seen, it does seem to be that students are much more engaged,” said Junco of the preliminary results.
Social networking web-sites have the potential to improve social interaction, agreed Graduate School of Education Professor Howard E. Gardner ’65.
“On the positive side of social networking, young people who have trouble with face to face friendships  often find it easier to work into a relationship
through writing,” Gardner said. “On the negative side, many young people spend too much time social networking.”

How can we learn from nature to get water without wells, materials without mining, or cooling without AC? Over 150 graduate students, faculty members, and Cambridge residents packed into a crowded Loeb Auditorium at the Graduate School of Design to hear author Janine M. Benyus address those very questions.
Biomimicry, as Benyus puts it, is about asking, “What would nature do if it sat at the design table, from the smallest light bulb to a city or region? What would nature’s consultation do to change the way our designs look and function?”
The talk, titled “Borrowing Nature’s Blueprints,” consisted of a series of case studies that sought to highlight the solutions to problems faced by designers, architects, and other innovators that could be found in nature.
One such problem: residents in Japan became bothered by the mini-sonic booms created by the bullet train as it exited tunnels near residential areas. Benyus said that the solution was found by turning to a bird called the Kingfisher, which catches its prey by dive-bombing into bodies of water without creating a single ripple thanks to certain properties of its tapering beak. Design firm JR West solved the noise issue by adapting the nose of the train to mimic the Kingfisher’s beak, increasing the train’s speed by 10 percent and reducing energy consumption by 15 percent in the process.
Students in attendance said they appreciated the novel examples that Benyus shared. Constantine A. Bouras, a GSD student who took exhaustive notes on the talk, said that it was “imperative that biological mechanisms be integrated into architecture.”
Biomimicry might be an unfamiliar field to many undergraduates, but in 2008 it was the beneficiary of the largest gift in the University’s history, when Business School graduate Hansjörg Wyss gave $125 million to found the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. The institute seeks to “discover the engineering principles that Nature uses to build living things...[to] revolutionize healthcare and create a more sustainable world,” according to its Web site.
Benyus said she hoped scientists at places like the Wyss Institute would keep striving to learn more from nature.
“We are so young as a species on this earth,” she said. “We’re in the process of growing up, and part of that is realizing that we are not alone and there have been some elders who have been here a lot longer than we have.”

University Health Services announced Monday that it is unlikely to receive all of the 15,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine it requested from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, although UHS received a small shipment of the vaccine this week.
Until it receives sufficient quantities of the vaccine, UHS will continue vaccinating only patients defined as high risk by the Department of Health.
The news comes amid nationwide delays in production and distribution of the vaccine. As recently as early November, Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 had said that all students, faculty, and staff covered by UHS insurance would be able to be vaccinated by now.
Rosenthal said yesterday that UHS still hopes to vaccinate students before the end of the semester.
“We haven’t gotten very much, and neither have our compatriots in Massachusetts, including some hospitals,” Rosenthal said.
According to Rosenthal, the new shipment will allow parents and guardians of children younger than six months of age, those with chronic medical conditions, health care workers, emergency responders—including the police and disability van operators—and medical and dental students directly involved in patient care to be vaccinated.
Most pregnant women and children covered by UHS insurance have already been vaccinated, he said.
Once UHS receives enough vaccines, it will immediately begin immunizations for groups not considered high-risk, Rosenthal said.
“We can immunize anywhere from 300 to 600 in a session”, said Rosenthal.
He added that UHS would offer immunizations over J-Term if possible.
In the meantime, UHS urges students to maintain good hygiene and to come in to UHS if they present any cold or flu symptoms.
“The illness so far has not been severe: it has been mild to moderate. But until we can get more shipments, we urge students to continue practicing good hygiene,” said Rosenthal.
UHS also experienced delays in receiving shipments of the seasonal flu vaccine, which caused multiple graduate school flu clinics to temporarily suspend services in October.
The number of H1N1 cases reported daily to UHS was on the rise until November 23, after which cases dropped dramatically.
Rosenthal said that the decrease in cases at UHS since the last Monday may be attributable to student absences over Thanksgiving Break.
The CDC has also reported a nationwide drop in the frequency of visits to doctors for “influenza-like illnesses” for the fourth straight week.
Rosenthal said that the Northeast was one of the last areas to be hit by the spread of H1N1, meaning that the nationwide trend may not hold on a regional level.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Typical lasers emit one beam of a single, exact wavelength, but a group of researchers have created a new laser that can emit multiple beams of different wavelengths.
This laser has potential applications in areas including pollution detection, climate monitoring, and remote sensing, according to Nanfang Yu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and one of the authors of the study.
“The big deal is that they were able to get a multibeam laser, and a multifunctional laser. It is very difficult to get more than one beam,” said Michael P. Rutter, communications director for SEAS.
The project, which began at the start of the year, was led by Federico Capasso, a professor of applied physics at SEAS, and two international teams—one from Japan and one from Switzerland, according to Yu.
“The project was initiated by the Harvard team,” Yu said. “The other team helped to design and process the lasers.”
The international teams also provided the ultra-thin layers of semiconductor materials, Yu added.
The creation of this laser marks a step forward from the quantum cascade laser, which was invented by Capasso and his collaborators at Bell Labs in 1994, Rutter wrote in a press release.
The researchers said the new laser has potential applications in many areas of environmental science. For example, the lasers could be used to gather information about levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, Rutter explained. He said that the researchers were “most excited” about the use of the lasers in climate monitoring.
“We wanted to create such devices for remote sensors and to detect pollution in the air,” said Yu.
The next step, according to Yu is to find collaborators both within Harvard and at other universities.
“We want to find other collaborators in the Environmental Engineering department of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, or the Chemical department,” said Yu.
The group’s work was featured online in the October 23rd issue of Applied Physics Letters and will appear as a cover story on December 7th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Empty stores indicate tough economic times, and Harvard Square has seen its share of blank windows and dark buildings. But, at least for a few more months, the most conspicuous storefront in the Square will light up Brattle St. with bold frocks, patterned cushions, quirky furniture, and floor-to-ceiling tapestries. The exhibit, under the direction of architect Jane F. Thompson, celebrates the fortieth anniversary of the glass and concrete edifice at 48 Brattle Street. Thompson’s late husband Benjamin C. Thompson designed the iconic building in 1969 as headquarters for Design Research, a home furnishings and design company the couple founded together in 1953.
Thompson’s husband, formerly chair of architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, also designed Faneuil Hall Marketplace.
After Design Research—popularly known as D/R—went bankrupt in 1978, Crate and Barrel occupied the space until last January.
The building returns to its roots to
showcase the designs D/R popularized after the company introduced products from avant-garde European designers such as Marimekko and Iittala to the United States
After the original D/R store opened at the current site of Harvard’s Gutman Library, the company catapulted into prominence as a forerunner of the fashion and interior design scene. Julia Child shopped at the Brattle Street D/R, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was pictured on the cover of a December 1960 Sports Illustrated wearing a pink Marimekko dress purchased from another D/R branch.
Harvard professor emeritus William J. Poorvu bought the building in 1978 and leased it to Crate and Barrel for 30 years.
Thompson says Crate and Barrel’s founder was a “disciple” of D/R, and the chain was previously a customer.
When the lease ended on January 25 of this year, Crate and Barrel closed its Brattle Street location permanently, and tourists and Cantabrigians alike were faced with a potentially permanent five-story concrete eyesore.
Thompson says the unconventional layout of the D/R headquarters and Crate and Barrel’s departure at a time when economic fears were at their peak combined to stall the search for a tenant.
When Thompson, who now heads the Boston-based architectural firm Thompson Design Group, was drawing up a proposal for another D/R exhibition that would not open for two years, she had an idea for the Brattle property. She would bring back the designs D/R introduced to Cambridge in the ’50s, ’60s, and early ’70s.
Enlisting fellow Marimekko collectors, Thompson assembled 300 Marimekko print dresses to temporarily fill the building.
“A few of us felt terrible about the empty space, which was not just bad for the owner, but also bad for Harvard Square and the other merchants,” she says. “We thought 300 dresses ought to be enough to fill the windows; at that time we weren’t ambitious enough to
start moving in furniture.”
The tentativeness with which Thompson approached the redecoration of the five-story space over the summer melted away as designers who worked for D/R during its heyday came forward with pieces ranging from peacock feather shaped wooden chairs to one-of-a-kind bolts of Marimekko fabric.
“We just sat around and said, ‘what shall we do, what do we have available,’ then began moving all our furniture, our pieces, into the building,” Thompson says. The effort to collect pieces for a possible long-term D/R retrospective exhibit snowballed. Thompson and company scoured Cambridge-area antique stores and their own homes for old cookware, vases, or furnishings originally sold by D/R almost 50 years ago. Marimekko donated some of its modern merchandise to the exhibit, and a photographer took portraits of people wearing original D/R clothing to hang alongside the furnishings. One former D/R employee even donated her Marimekko wedding gown and bridesmaid dress.
“Everybody just loved being in this place so much that they just wouldn’t go home,” Thompson says. “We started around June, worked every weekend throughout the summer up until the very last day of October.”
At the end of October, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of D/R’s introduction of Marimekko to the United States, Thompson held a reception in the award-winning building. The Marimekko president flew in from Finland to attend.
Those hoping to walk around inside the exhibit or purchase any of the unusual pieces on display will be disappointed—all glass doors on all sides are locked and passersby can only admire the pieces from the street.
“It’s such a great use of the space during a period of time when the owners of the building are still waiting for an appropriate tenant,” executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise E. Jillson says. “The response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive, as well as grateful.”
Jillson adds that many longtime Cambridge residents remembered the innovative products introduced by D/R  fondly and were ecstatic at their reemergence.
Thompson says the exhibit design came together “out of memory” and “sort of like playing cards.”
“We worked with what we could, and with what everybody remembered,” she says. “It’s a genuine reliving, and everybody’s who lived in Cambridge remembers [D/R].”
Estelle Pedro, assistant manager of nearby store Clothware, says that while she had no idea whether having the D/R retrospective next door is improving her own shop’s business, she knows from personal experience the importance of the window display.
“It helps to have something there than nothing at all, of course,” Pedro says. “I also think it’s very smart of them to display an example of what they want to see in a tenant.”
The D/R retrospective runs through April 2010. Meanwhile, Poorvu is still seeking a permanent tenant. Sensitive to the original design concepts and ambitions espoused by the Thompsons and D/R, Poorvu has had difficulty finding an appropriate occupant to replace Crate and Barrel.
“We want an exciting tenant who will use the building properly,” he says.

The unique global reach of the 2005 controversy surrounding 12 caricatures of the prophet Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper reflected mounting religious and ethnic tensions in Europe and the Muslim world, said the author of a new book on the subject at a Barker Center talk last night.
“It was a very unusual crisis in that the scope of actors was extraordinary,” said Brandeis University professor Jytte Klausen, citing the involvement of European parliaments, presidents, the European Union, the United Nations, pan-Islamic conferences, universities, and religious officials.
Klausen said that she has witnessed the redefining of conservatism in many European countries in a way that increasingly views Islam as a challenge to national identity, the issue of immigration emerging as a source of underlying tension. The Muslim response to the cartoons—according to Klausen—represented the breakpoint of existing hostile attitudes.
“There was a generalized sentiment that enough was enough,” she said. “Muslims were being stereotyped and vilified at a level they found unacceptable. The cartoons were the last drop in a glass that was already pretty filled with bitterness.”
But Klausen stressed that the editorial cartoons were not published with malicious intent and that the editor was only aiming to break taboo, a point that resonated with attendance members.
“It’s interesting that something that seems so benign to one side ends up being such a big deal to the other,” said Freeha Riaz, who attended the event, part of the “Islam in the West” lecture series sponsored by The Harvard Center for European Studies, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, the Islamic Legal Studies Program, and the Humanities Center.
But, in addition to the uproar surrounding the 2005 editorial cartoons, Klausen’s book, titled “The Cartoons That Shook the World,” has itself emerged as a point of controversy. Yale University Press, the book’s publisher, decided this August to omit the original cartoons for fear of provoking a resurgence in violence. The move drew the ire of the editorial boards of The Washington Post and The New York Post among others. “In effect, Yale University Press is allowing violent extremists to set the terms of free speech,” wrote the Post’s editorial staff. “As an academic press that embraces the university’s motto of ‘Lux et Veritas,’ it should be ashamed.”
“It is a difficult moment for me as an author to see my own book perpetuating misunderstanding,” Klausen said. “In order to grasp why Muslims were upset we need to look directly and discuss. That can’t be done now.”
Some audience members also expressed surprise at Yale’s decision.
“Yale missed the point of [the book] completely,” said John T. Trumpbour, a Harvard Law School staff member who attended the talk.

Students who used to grab lunch at Z Square will have to wait a few months longer for its successor to open.
Despite earlier projections of a December opening, the 14 JFK St. space that previously housed Z Square café will likely remain empty until early spring, according to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
The delay probably reflects careful planning, Jillson said, citing what she said was property owner Cambridge Savings Bank’s reputation for attention to detail.
“I’ll bet they spent a lot of time making sure everything is appropriate and good,” she added.
Z Square, the restaurant previously housed at that location, was shut down in January due to license violations.
In October, the space was leased to Harvard Square restaurateurs Gerry Sheerin, Peter Lee, Sean Kennedy and Patrick Lee of the Grafton Group, according to Elizabeth Lascaze, a client representative for The Grafton Group.
Their collection also includes Grafton Street Pub & Grill, Redline Food and Drink, and Temple Bar in Harvard Square; as well as The Irish Village pub in Brighton.
“Patrick and his team, including his brother Peter, are very responsible and thoughtful property and business owners and do a very good job,” Jillson said.
The current project, which is unnamed, is still “in the early stages of development and its concept [is] in progress,” wrote Lascaze in an
e-mailed statement.
“The space will provide a two-floor, 135-seat dining room with private event space capability, an indoor café, and a full-service bar in addition to a 20-seat outdoor café,” Lascaze wrote.
Construction on the space will begin soon and will most likely take several months to complete, according to Jillson, who told The Crimson in late September that she hoped the project would be done in time for the annual Winter Carnival held in mid-January.

As part of campus commemoration of World AIDS Day yesterday, Philip L. Yenawine—the co-founder of Visual Understanding in Education, an art education initiative—spoke about artistic responses to the AIDS epidemic at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum.
The lecture, entitled “Seeing AIDS,” was given in conjunction with a Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts exhibit called “ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS Crisis, 1987-1993.” The exhibit, which has been on display since mid-October, showcases posters, stickers, and other visual media that were used in the political discourse about AIDS during that period.
The subject was personal for Yenawine, who worked as director of education at the Museum of Modern Art from 1983 to 1993—during the height of the AIDS epidemic.
“I’m revisiting a time not as a scholar, but as one still haunted by an experience,” said Yenawine, referencing the deaths of friends and loved ones from AIDS.
Yenawine developed the idea of “A Day Without Art,” which began on Dec. 1, 1989, as a day when museums would close or conceal certain works in order to reflect on the impact of AIDS on the art community.
“It is a privilege to have a speaker of this caliber who is willing to share some of these stories of how artists have contributed to social change” in response to AIDS, said M. Ray Williams, director of education at the Harvard Art Museum.
Artists in the late 80s and early 90s used their politically-charged work to turn the virus into something that could be discussed in the general public, Yenawine said.
Audience members said they were moved by Yenawine’s personal experiences.
“It didn’t fit into what the conventional idea of a talk is,” said Martha A. “Martabel” Wasserman ’10, who is writing a senior thesis on the “ACT UP” exhibition.
Several student groups also commemorated World AIDS Day. The Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition rallied yesterday for AIDS-related funding in front of Senator John Kerry’s Boston office. And tonight, the Health and AIDS Coalition and Queer Students and Allies will host a candlelight vigil in front of Memorial Church, illuminate a ribbon in front of Grays Hall, and hold a discussion on gay men’s health and Brazilian immigrants living in Boston in an event co-sponsored by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
“The theme of World AIDS Day this year is universal access,” QSA co-chair Marco Chan ’11 said. “We need to look at different ways to conduct outreach so that everyone has access [to treatment].”

Harvard Business School Dean Jay O. Light will step down at the end of this school year, he announced in an e-mail to the HBS community Wednesday afternoon.
Light said that it was a good time, both for him and for the institution, for a new leader to take over.
"As the financial crisis hit it was clear to me that we had to move quickly and I had to take ownership of the process of making sure this institution got through what we now call the 'Great Recession,'" Light said in an interview Wednesday afternoon. "That's done... We're at the right place to bring in a new dean who will execute whatever set of choices we make."
During his tenure, Light has overseen a $600 million capital campaign for the Business School, the complete renovation of the school's Baker Library, and the introduction of the 2+2 program, which allows students to apply to HBS after their junior year of college, as well as leading the school through a wave of budget cuts earlier this year. Light has been at the helm of the business school since being named interim dean in August 2005. He assumed the position on a permanent basis in April 2006.
Prior to the deanship, Light served as Senior Associate Dean and Director of Planning and Development. In addition to teaching finance courses, he has been a member of the school's leadership team for 23 years. He joined the Business School faculty in 1969.
University President Drew G. Faust said she will begin to assemble a faculty search committee soon to look for a new dean, with the goal of having a successor in place by the time Light leaves in June.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences and four of the University's professional schools offered retirement plans to members of their faculty earlier today, marking the realization of an idea that surfaced when it became clear last fall that the University's endowment would be hard-hit by the financial crisis.
The packages, offered by the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Divinity School, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, represent the first official retirement program laid out by the University since the federal mandatory retirement law—which permitted Universities to force professors to retire at the age of 70—was repealed in 1994.
One of the three retirement options put forward under the new program by FAS, the University's largest school, provides a maximum of one-year paid sabbatical to tenured faculty members 65 or older who have served at Harvard for at least 10 years. Faculty members who choose to participate must accept by June 30, 2010.
The unveiling of the package—applicable to nearly one-fourth of the tenured faculty in FAS—comes less than a month after FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview that he plans to reduce the overall size of the FAS in upcoming years through attrition. Currently, 24 percent of Harvard’s tenured faculty is aged 65 or older—the average age of tenured faculty members within FAS is 56.
In previous interviews, Smith himself has framed the faculty retirement packages, which were in progress as early as this spring, as part of budget-saving effort aimed at resurrecting the Faculty from a financial deficit that yawned as wide as $220 million in April (the figure has since been cut in half, Smith announced this fall). If any of the 127 faculty members who were offered the package chose to accept it, the plan would open up positions that would only be filled again on a case-by-case basis.
The package is presented as service to professors for whom retirement is already in sight. "The FAS faculty retirement program is designed to support faculty who are considering retirement," wrote FAS Spokesman Jeff A. Neal in an e-mail to The Crimson Wednesday.
Neal added that there was no target figure for participation in the program or any projections relating to the amount of budgetary relief that could be in store for FAS.
"[W]e do not expect that there will be any savings related to this program in the near-term and we cannot estimate at this time what savings may accrue in the out years," Neal wrote. 
In the past, Smith has emphasized that over half of the Faculty's budget is written over to compensation for staffers and professors. 
Harvard professors are currently the highest paid in the country, according to a recent report by the American Association of University Professors, with an average salary of $192,600 per year. In the 2009 fiscal year, FAS spent $147.8 million on all faculty salaries, according to the Dean’s Annual Report.
The FAS package is a one-time offer, which, currently, the Faculty “has no expectation of offering...again at a later date,” according to page nine of the pamphlet sent out to eligible professors today.
Last spring, in the midst of budget troubles, the University offered an early retirement package to staff members aged 55 or older who had served at Harvard for 10 years or more. That package was expressively proposed as an early retirement incentive aimed at trimming numbers and cutting costs.
In the FAS faculty package, eligible professors are presented with three options—a one, two, or four-year retirement plan. All eligible professors will be given $1,000 to support their financial planning while considering the report.
In the one-year plan, professors would maintain research and advising obligations while on paid sabbatical during the 2010-2011 academic year and retire fully by June 30, 2011.
In the two-year plan, professors would maintain part-time teaching positions for the next two academic years, including two semesters of paid sabbatical and retire fully by June 30, 2012.
In the four-year plan, professors would teach and have service obligations halftime and retire fully on June 30, 2014.
Under all three options, faculty members will be paid their full salaries during the 2010-2011 fiscal year, so the plan will not affect this fiscal year’s spring budget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football’s Week 3 contest at Lehigh offered more surprises than one often sees on any given Saturday.
A Lehigh student pulled an Ashlee Simpson on the national anthem, the Crimson went with its third-string running back—senior Cheng Ho—who had a banner day, and Harvard coach Tim Murphy traded in his signature black baseball hat for a camouflage cap with an “H” on the front and the defense’s motto “Do Work”—from the MTV reality show “Rob and Big”—on the back.
“It’s a combination of things,” Murphy says of his new headwear. “Solidarity with our players who are in the military and heading into harm’s way, and kind of the work ethic and culture that those elite military teams have, and the blue-collar thing—all those things together.”
The hats, which were made possible by sophomore defensive tackle Matt Lunati’s father Pete, were originally intended for the members of the defensive unit who made it in for a snap. According to captain Carl Ehrlich, it provided ample motivation for the guys who weren’t seeing time on defense.
“Everyone wanted a hat,” Ehrlich says, adding that junior fullback Anthony Rotio vowed to steal the hat from his roommate, junior tackle David Sklar.
But soon the hats were opened up to everyone on the team—though the camo style changed and the message on the back was now a unified “Harvard Football.”
“The locker room was littered with them,” Ehrlich says.
“I loved the idea of the hats,” says freshman wide receiver Mitch Ross. “Coach Murphy says we want to be representing the community in both blue collar and white collar.”
All season long, Murphy stressed the blue-collar mentality.
“We always talk about having this blue-collar type of work ethic, which doesn’t necessarily mean that your mom or dad was a carpenter or a plumber,” Murphy says. “But it’s realizing that you need a great work ethic to succeed at Harvard, on and off the field.”
And for Ross especially, the significance of the camouflage is personal.
His father Warner, a three-year letterwinner as a center at Ole Miss in his day, now serves overseas as a Major in the National Guard and will be up for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel in January.
“Not only [do the hats represent] the hard work we put in as a team, but also what the military does as a team,” Ross says. “It’s one big team, one big family.”
The elder Ross actually received a hat earlier in the season—before Mitch got his.
“When my dad came to visit before he was deployed overseas, our captain gave him one,” Ross admits. “I was pretty jealous.”
But Warner Ross isn’t the only member of the football extended family serving his country. Former wide receiver Corey Mazza ’07-’08 and former defensive tackle Matt Drazba ’08 are both training for the Marine Corps.
For the members of the football team, the military regimen and the blue-collar mindset translates to destructive execution on the football field.
“[It] builds character on top of everything else,” Ehrlich says.
Ross, like many on this year’s squad, feels at home in the environment Murphy has created for the team. The competitiveness and intensity required for each player to receive a much-coveted hat are not far off from his daily interactions at home.
“My family’s very competitive,” Ross says. “Once we start something, we never quit it.”
Murphy stressed Harvard’s resilience all year long, and for a team that dealt with crippling injuries and major personnel overhauls and still came away with a 6-1 league record, the hats seem a fitting remnant of the 2009 Crimson football squad that never quit.

The Harvard men’s hockey team had a chance for retribution against Brown at the Bright Hockey Center last night.
In the first round of the ECAC playoffs last year, Brown (2-7-1, 1-4-1 ECAC) ended the season for Harvard (1-7-2, 1-5-2) with two shut-out wins, a brutal loss for the favored Crimson.
In what might be called the battle of the bottom dwellers—both came into the match with just one win in 12 games combined in-league—the Bears escaped once again last night, winning 4-1 after netting two empty net goals in the last 45 seconds of the game. Though Harvard outshot Brown 43-33, Bears goalie Michael Clemente kept the visitors in the game, denying the Crimson on several threatening shot attempts and extending the home team’s winless streak to nine games.
“We have to find more ways to get pucks through, more ways to create second and third chances for ourselves by hitting the net,” Harvard Coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Overall I was happy with the way our team worked. We came to play and we battled, but we didn’t get rewarded.”
Ten minutes in, Harvard was on its first power play, but couldn’t convert on either of its two opportunities—one went just wide of the net, the other was stopped by the pad of the goaltender.
Sophomore Jarred Smith then gave Brown the edge, scoring with two minutes left in the first period, with an assist from senior Jordan Pietrus.
At 2:15 into the second period, Brown blueliner Jeff Buvinow scored a powerplay goal, trapping the puck with his skate and sending a wrist shot into the top right shelf past the glove of Crimson junior goaltender Kyle Richter.
On the other side, opportunity after opportunity passed Harvard by. Senior Doug Rogers, straight off the bench on a line change, found the puck on his stick, slotted it over to a teammate on the right side of the net, but Harvard couldn’t finish.
But, Harvard inched back with a goal by freshman Conor Morrison at 13:15. Scoring his sixth goal in the last week—this time with an assist from sophomore Daniel Moriarty and Rogers—the recently named ECAC Rookie of the Week is pacing the Crimson’s offense at this point in the season.
Just when Harvard looked to take momentum into the third period, though, a five minute major penalty was called on freshman Alex Fallstrom for hitting from the back.
“We shot ourselves in the foot with a couple penalties here and there,” Donato said. “Certainly the five minute one took our chance for momentum.”
Although Brown didn’t convert on the penalty, the Crimson was forced to play more defensively and could not score in that time. In the third period, Harvard kept the pressure on and had a chance to earn the game-tying goal with one minute left when Brown defender Sean McMonagle was called for interference.
But the powerplay never got set up like the Crimson had hoped, and Brown scored two empty net goals, taking a full-on lead and dashing any aspirations of a comeback.
“The attitude and confidence level is really down and it’s hard to get individuals to really play with the amount of confidence that they should have, and to do that collectively as a team,” senior Alex Biega said. “But we just have to keep working and dig a little deeper.”
Brown goaltender Clemente had another stand-out performance, recording 42 saves, Clemente is the major reason why Harvard has struggled against the Bears for the last two years. Harvard went 0-2-2 against Brown last year, and in two play-out games, the then-freshman posted shutouts at Bright.
“Their goalie has been sensational,” Donato said. “I think he made three saves in the first period that were almost sure goals. I thought we had a solid five or six grade A opportunities. I give him credit. It happens, but obviously for us right now its frustrating.”
“Its tough to believe in what you’re trying to do when you don’t taste success,” Denato continued. “We are certainly frustrated, but in no way defeated.”

52 wins. Two Ivy League Championships. Four post-season appearances. No matter how you measure it, the men’s soccer Class of ’09 has had a memorable run.
When their season ended last Sunday with a loss to Maryland in the third round of the NCAA tournament, what many are calling Harvard’s most talented class ever walked off Ohiri field for the last time.
Their impact on the program, though, will be felt for a long time. When this group of seniors entered Harvard in the 2006 season, the team was painfully mediocre. The Crimson had gone 6-8-2 the previous season, and had been hovering around .500 since 1996.
But during the seniors’ tenure, the team has had four consecutive twelve-plus win seasons, and is making a name for itself around the country.
“They’ve definitely put this program on track to maybe become a national powerhouse,” freshman forward Brian Rogers says. “They won the Ivy League as freshmen, and they’ve made the tournament every year.”
“This senior class has raised the expectations for the whole team,” adds Jamie Clark, who took over the Harvard coaching job last season. “With that comes a pride in the program.”
Co-captains Andre Akpan and Brian Grimm, defender Kwaku Nyamekye, and midfielders Adam Rousmaniere and Desmond Mitchell make up the five-some, all of whom held a starting spot on this year’s roster.
“They each brought something unique,” Rogers says. “They all provided a great example of how to be responsible and play well and hold yourself as a Harvard soccer player.”
Akpan, undoubtedly the best player on the Harvard team, scored 12 of the team’s 32 goals this season, and tied or broke nearly every Crimson offensive record in his career.
“He’s going to be in the record books for a long time to come,” Clark says. “He put the ceiling high for everyone.”
Akpan missed a penalty kick in Sunday’s game—a goal that would have given him sole possession of the all-time Harvard scoring record—and remains tied with Chris Ohiri ’64. Akpan graduates at the end of this semester, and will very likely be drafted into Major League Soccer.
Nyamekye, who at times resembled a brick wall in the Harvard defense, also has a potential career in soccer ahead of him.
“Kwaku will be very difficult to replace,” Clark says. “I think he’s the best defender in college soccer. Physically, he can handle any attacking player in the country.”
Nyamekye and the Harvard defense held opponents to 15 goals in 19 games this season.
But even beyond superstardom on the field, the Crimson’s seniors have provided much needed leadership as the program has developed.
Grimm, one of the co-captains, is a quieter leader of the team, as well as a talented midfielder. Described by his coach as “the glue of the midfield,” the New Jersey native has proven to be a valued stalwart, starting 26 of 27 games over his last two seasons.
Just as important as Grimm’s guidance on the pitch, fellow midfielder Mitchell serves an important role to his teammates off the field. In addition to tallying seven points on the year, Mitchell is known as a mentor on the team, constantly looking out for the younger players.
Rousmaniere, also in the midfield, is as a smart passer and goal creator, and tied for the team lead in assists. The “set-piece guy,” according to Clark, Rousmaniere was often the one to feed Akpan for a goal.
But the team will remember the seniors for far more than their skill and success.
“For all their talent and all the wins that they’ve put up over four years, they were very team oriented and very caring,” Clark reflects. “They brought along the young guys, put a sense of community into the team, and created a great culture and a happy culture.”
The loss of these five players next year will deal a crushing blow to Harvard, but the team feels that it will be able to remain strong.
“The standards and expectations [the seniors] have left will just have to be filled by the new guys,” Clark says. “We have a lot of eager boys who believe they could be playing already this year. They’ll get their chance to prove it.”
Rogers, who will be taking on a great deal of the goal-scoring responsibility next year, agrees.
“Guys are really going to have to step up,” the freshman says.
The graduating class has created a vast amount of respect for the team, and set the bar higher than it has been in decades. And while the seniors know that they depart with a tremendous legacy, they too have confidence that their successors will uphold the program’s growing pedigree.
“Getting to the Tournament—while that’s an accomplishment—I don’t think that’s good enough any more,” Grimm says. “From here on out there are going to be high expectations for the team, and they will be expected to compete for an Ivy League championship every year.”

The long-anticipated time has come. Harvard’s very own porn rag, Diamond Magazine, has released its second—well first “official”—issue, a sample of which you can download for your reading pleasure at its Web site: www.diamond-mag.com.
While you could purchase the full copy of Diamond’s latest release for the low, low price of $9.99 ($29.99 for the print edition), FlyBy is here for you, letting you know that this Diamond is probably not a girl's best friend.
Diamond Magazine, as you may remember, was launched in September of last year by founder Matthew M. Di Pasquale ’09. While H-bomb had long ago scandalized campus with photos of students’ naughty parts, DiPasquale was quick to point out that his publication would be different than H-Bomb’s—basically all of the nudity without that stupid artsy shit. The 41-page online-only pilot issue featured articles on the hottest new summer kicks, The Dark Knight, and college football, in addition to a veritable bevy of garish fonts and clip art. But those looking for some skin were sorely disappointed. The issue had two models, only one of which was naked—DiPasquale.
While the latest installment does feature DiPasquale in the buff again, this time he is joined by a whole host of co-eds from around the Ivies. Diamond's "Single Dame" is Andrea Smith, who the magazine says is affiliated with Harvard's Graduate School of Design. In her article-interview hybrid (it’s nouveau journalism) DiPasquale writes: “It was a tricky situation to contemplate, given that she is a Christian and that she’s done work for the Memorial Church at Harvard.” Let’s pray Reverend Gomes doesn’t find out.
Diamond aficionados will notice that DiPasquale is in considerably better shape than he was in the first issue, though he’s just as hairy. And while in the sample issue there are only two photos of him—one rugged and unshaven (“Rough Diamond”) and one clean (“Polished Up”)—those shots of his flaccid penis are as hot as ever.
And as before, DiPasquale does a hard-hitting interview with himself. In this one he claims that milk is the most carcinogenic substance adults consume. So milk is one thing we can be sure DiPasquale won’t be swallowing.
According to the site, the next issue comes out in April 2010. And with this issue you won’t be coming any time soon.

FlyBy recently got hold of the Lampoon’s latest issue in an exclusive leak (aka two poonsters came by and dropped it off, those shameless publicity seekers.). “Tenderfoot” is Issue #1 of Volume CXCIX (yes, that’s 199. The Lampoon was founded in 1876. We don't understand their numbering system.), and is the last issue of Matthew K. Grzecki '10's reign as president.
For some strange reason, the  “new” issue is for October 2009. What happened Grzecki? It’s December.  If you miss your deadline you should at least change the date.
“Tenderfoot” has a specific  focus on technology and atomization of American culture. The title implies  (and then laments) newbies in a world in which humans have become estranged  by technological individualism and isolation. It’s both a diatribe  and glorification of post-modernism. Damn, Lampoon. So deep.
“[I]s this going on a site  for fat people?” a porn star asks her marketing agent in a piece by  KMM.
A piece called “My Video  Game Idea” pitches a vision for a new game in a meta-novel-ish vision—a  2-D game that features a voluptuous if pixilated woman is being played  by an even more attractive and higher resolution woman, which is being  watched and enjoyed by a fat man on a couch, which is all being observed  by a fat man who is wearing virtual reality goggles and sitting in a  “futuristic chair.” We learn that the man on the couch is really  the fat man’s avatar.
Though the piece is pretty funny and probably successful in exploring the overlap of simulation and reality in a modern world, it's reminiscent  of last year’s University of Chicago Application essay question about  the “Powers of 10." And FlyBy already suffered through that one.
A piece by outgoing “Narthex”  John B. Owens ’10 (apparently a narthex is the entrance of a church?  What?) describes a “brain uploading place.” I mean, hasn’t everyone  always wanted to upload its brain into a robot body and live forever?  FlyBy has.
A man touring the lab narrates,  “Mikey nudged me, put his hands to his cheeks and opened his eyes  really wide. As soon as I turned around he nudged me again and did the  same thing, but this time he had smeared some goat’s blood around  his neck. Out of all my friends, Mikey carried the largest number of  vials filled with goat blood. His carrying satchel wasn’t the nicest  one but it was up there.” Creepy.
In "Have You Seen Her" one boy inquires about the locations of various girls. Turns out they're all busy--that is, getting busy-- with other guys. Ouch. It's not the racy girls that make us cringe, it's the male adolescent insecurity that we can feel seeping from each line. Sorry man, but she's (ALL of them) just not that into you.
In the minutes of a town meeting in Willow Graves Estates we read that Zed (?) interrupts the meeting repeatedly to ask that the town board be dismantled and he be made president. Zed (?) is ignored. Zed (?) then motions to be put in charge. Zed (?) is not seconded, then denied. FlyBy wonders why this sounds vaguely familiar. UC...?
In one piece called "Safe Sex" a teacher discusses his sex-ed curriculum. Turns out the guide to safe sex includes condoms and duct tape on the girl's mouth. The bewildered teacher says he thought that was how it was done. That's hilarious. And so original.
The art, as usual, is mind-bending  and delightful. FlyBy especially likes the drawing of two people in  a tall building vomiting on a man on the sidewalk below. Nice work,  IMTB.
But the most bizarre part of  the most recent issue is the ads. Let’s play a little game of real  or hoax. Which of these ads are legit?
Real or Hoax:
“No Name Restaurant” (FlyBy  can’t decide which would be weirder: that “No Name Restaurant”  purchased this ad, or that the Lampoon made it up and paid for the full-page  of color themselves)
“Longy School of Music”  (Okay, Longy is on the way to the Quad, we know. But we didn’t know  that the whacked-out, sleep-deprived, and socially-awkward subscribers  of the Lampoon are just what Longy is looking for...?)
“The Historical Out of Town  News” (Is the newsstand’s address really 0 Harvard Square?! That’s  incredible.)
“The Kebab Factory” (In  Somerville? Since when does the Lampoon have a large readership in Somerville?)
“Beertubes.com” (The ad  features a fat man in the ad wearing a COLLEGE T-shirt. This makes FlyBy  think this is legit)
“Accurate Collision Inc.”  (Who would name a full service auto body Accurate Collision? And why  is it always the back cover?)
“Bond University in Australia”  (The same ad was printed twice. Either Bond University is overzealous  or someone was trying to fill white space...)
“Boloco” (okay we know  this is real, but the phallic wrapped burrito is unreal.)

If you thought that Widener Library was a place where your soul could go to die, and your body could go to escape the rain, half of your presumptions were recently proven false when it started raining inside a reading room the other day.
"It's the skylights," said Harvard College Libraries spokesperson Beth Brainard. "We're aware of the problem, and it's been an ongoing process of resolving it."
According to Brainard, the University is working with the contractors who installed the skylights during Widener's renovation.
"Generally, leaks are reported. In this case, no one reported it," Brainard said (FlyBy totally reported it! Though admittedly not to the library's operation's staff...). "It's just one of those unfortunate things."
Indeed. Like dumping water on that priceless book you're reading.

Flyby hears that writers of Princeton Tiger, Princeton's humor magazine, totally, genuinely, and completely drove up to Harvard the Friday over Thanksgiving break to give upperclassmen some hot breakfast.
From the Prox (The Daily Princetonian's lesser version of Flyby):
"The volunteers, all students belonging to Princeton's humor magazine, The Princeton Tiger, used their fall recess to drive to Cambridge in order to help their less fortunate peers. 'Everyone's hurting in this economy,' said Steven Liss, Chairman of The Tiger."
Harvard's response? "I don't eat breakfast, anyway," Roshane K. Campbell '12 said.
Way to be grounded and understand the plight of the "less fortunate," editors of The Tiger. Oh, and Flyby just received some breaking news: editors of The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that occasionally used to publish a so-called humor magazine, recently announced that they'll be driving down to Princeton to serve as stand-in butlers for the few that the university had to lay off due to its own budget cuts....

Foreign Policy magazine has published its first annual list of the "Top 100 Global Thinkers," and guess what! Some Harvard professors and graduates made the cut—four of them in the top 10.
Ben S. Bernanke '75 came in at the top of the list for insignificant achievements, such as saving the U.S. economy from collapse.
Harvard Law School Professor Cass R. Sunstein, now on leave at the White House, landed number 7 on the list for his works on crafting policy to effect changes in behavior.
Rounding out the top of the list from Cambridge were HLS graduate President Barack Obama (2)—an odd choice, we know—and economist and Harvard Ph.D. Nouriel Roubini (4).
Surprised more of your favorite professors didn't land in the single digits? Don't worry—there is no need to transfer to Yale—more faculty members including Nicholas Christakis (50), Niall C.D Ferguson (56), Amartya Sen (58), and Samantha Power (80) got a spot on the elite list.

You know how Yale was supposed to be way more lenient about tailgating at The Game? Someone forgot to tell the Yale Police.
The Eli popo wrote up three minors for possession or consumption of alcohol, according to the Yale Daily News. That's compared to no citations in 2007 when The Game was last in New Haven in 2007.
Yale Police Chief James Perrotti attributed the increased police activity to a new polic detail dedicated to "panhandling and public drunkenness....The detail was not established to monitor underage drinking and alcohol purchases, Perrotti said, though Yale students have happened to 'cross its path.'"
Yikes. Flyby managed to avoid the cops in our tailgating revelry, and the official tailgate rules still beat the ones in Boston. But still, here's hoping that unit's disbanded by 2011....
