In her debut novel “Rainbirds,” Clarissa Goenawan explores the relationship between Ren Ishida, a Japanese graduate student, and his sister, Keiko. The novel begins with Ren learning of his sister’s murder. Her shocking death makes him question his understanding of her as an innocent girl. The novel portrays different periods of Ren’s life, shifting between present day and various snippets of past experiences with Keiko. Ren makes realizations as the novel unravels the burgeoning secrets that Keiko concealed from Ren. Goenawan uses her experiences as a short story writer to her advantage, weaving together a complex string of events that are seemingly unrelated, yet mesh perfectly.
Goenawan writes achronological sequences that are both easy to follow, yet fascinating to experience. She avoids revealing details about Keiko and her murder in the typical murder-mystery format. Instead, current events in Ren’s life trigger memories of Keiko that slowly unfold to piece together her story. The connections between his memories and his present experiences are so strong that the pair buoy each other to benefit the overall plot. The format that Goenawan chooses takes apart the standard novel structure and replaces it with a thrilling unraveling of a single, complex mystery.
Through the mixing of timelines, Goenawan also manages to interweave distinct lives and experiences into a single entity. She explores the deep thoughts of multiple characters within single chapters, giving the reader multiple perspectives of similar events. Ren has faults—Goenawan makes him human and presents him exactly how he is. Furthermore, she discusses relationships between different characters by carrying themes between them. Characters explore faulty relationships in distinct ways, showing Goenawan’s compelling thoughts in different areas.
Some of Goenawan’s prose reads awkwardly throughout the text, especially in her descriptions that clearly lack any sort of imagery. Goenawan will throw in a sentence revealing important emotions: “I wished everything that had brought me here had been a dream.” From there, Ren will immediately launch into thinking about the “prominent politician” Mr. Katou. However, this choice matches and benefits the story’s development. On a basic level, the simple and somewhat graceless prose deadens the scenes, contributing to the atmospheric effect. More importantly, it provides the reader with a way to further understand Ren’s point of view: As he discovers different clues and ideas, Goenawan brings various thoughts and memories to the surface in an unwieldy, but fitting, manner. Ren does not understand clues about Keiko’s life in a logical way, but rather by a character shocked and confused by the revelations. Ren’s experiences draw the reader in as he continually exhibits his shared lack of understanding.
Beyond the novel’s structure, the plotline itself is intriguing and unique. The twists the story takes are unexpected, but logical. Goenawan is not afraid to experiment with the story’s directions, while still creating a satisfying narrative. She does not attempt to have a single concept carry the entire novel. Instead, she treats the story as a true life experience, often adding in details that seem unimportant, but significantly contribute to the novel’s base atmosphere and structure. This concept makes the story unpredictable and creates a riveting plot.
Goenawan succeeds in writing a novel that has the feel of a short story collection seamlessly weaved together. In “Rainbirds,” she uses her unique strengths to create a spellbinding murder mystery.

“On a little speck of ice at the...end of the universe known as Kerenza IV…” an illegal mining colony is struggling to survive an invasion. “Obsidio” is the third book in the Illuminae Files trilogy by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff. It has the daunting task of explaining how thousands of people who have been cut off from the rest of the universe overcome their attackers. What’s more, the entirety of the trilogy is comprised of files in the form of emails, online chats, transcripts of videos, handwritten notes and drawings. This format undoubtedly makes the trilogy unique, allowing “Obsidio” to overcome some recurring issues.
The files allow for a lot of information to be transmitted. The various fonts, drawings, cartoons, and graphics are a break from the usual paragraphs found in any novel. “Obsidio” often utilizes maps and images of space in action scenes, interweaving the text into streets or the flight paths of spaceships. These action sequences lean on the placement of the text rather than the text itself to convey the excitement and tension of conflict. This can quickly feel overused, but Kaufman and Kristoff make sure to employ this tactic in moderation. Overall, the file format does the novel justice by compiling information in intriguing and humorous ways.
However, there are certain aspects of the novel that Kaufman and Kristoff, unfortunately, do not use sparingly. An early file comes with the note, “be warned: curse words incoming.” But the warning seems unnecessary, since all swearing is censored by a black block. At first, the freedom to decide what curse word fills the space is entertaining[,] but the omissions quickly begin to disrupt the flow of the text. Similarly, the misspellings and text lingo within online chats—while realistic—are tiring. “u dun need me 2 do anything else?” is answered with, “no, ur space ninja duties r concluded 4 the day.” Although the syntax is familiar, it is tiring to read in bulk. The censorship and text lingo are parts of “Obsidio” that would benefit from less frequent use.
The lingo and drawings may make “Obsidio” appear juvenile, but the underlying themes are mature and complex. The narrative asks if the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, as the artificial intelligence aboard the space ships make drastic and often inhumane decisions. The debates invoke the consequences and benefits of utilitarianism, without explicitly naming them. The situation aboard the spaceship Mao—there is not enough oxygen for everyone—is similar to the popular trolley problem: A train rolls down a track towards four people, but a lever could reroute the train to a different track with only one person on it. At its core, “Obsidio” deals with philosophical questions about the value of an individual human life.
The most interesting character within the series is not a human at all, but rather an AI called AIDAN. AIDAN is seemingly all-powerful but devolves into many people’s worst nightmare: It develops feelings. However, AIDAN is not human with a full range of emotional understanding. It recognizes that “I AM NOT GOOD. NOR AM I EVIL. I AM NO HERO. NOR AM I VILLAIN” in its distinctive capitalized narrative. AIDAN’s struggle with feelings makes it a complex character, and also poses a question for what the future of technology holds.
“Obsidio” is many things: It is a book with an unusual format that on many occasions disregards normal syntax, yet it manages to ask philosophical questions that have plagued the human race for years while pondering the future of AI technology.

Before presenting his newest release, “Islandborn,” Junot Díaz thanked the Harvard Book Store for its role in jump-starting his career. “Since I began as a writer, Harvard Books has supported me with great constancy and just enormous energy. It’s been an act of devotion. I certainly would not have a career if it wasn’t for teachers and booksellers.” One Pulitzer-prize winning novel, two short story collections, and one children’s book later, it’s hard to imagine the MIT creative writing professor as anything but the successful champion for Caribbean, Latinx, and immigrant narratives he became ever since his first book, “Drown,” was published in 1996. During the sold-out book signing, Díaz explored how representation, solidarity, and the multiplicity of fiction informed his writing process for “Islandborn,” his first children’s book.
“How many people here are themselves or the children of immigrants?” Díaz asked at the beginning of his talk. Countless hands shot up and the crowd cheered. “If every time the word ‘immigrant’ was mentioned we would all cheer, we would be able to change some of the affective regimes that surround that word,” he said. “So many of us have been trained in that default anti-immigrant racism that the very word makes us cringe and get defensive and apologetic.” Díaz presented “Islandborn” as the opposite—a proud portrayal of immigrants and their children’s attempts to combat the erasure of their origins. Lola, the book’s heroine, is one such child. Compelled by a school assignment, she tries to compile memories from other immigrants about the Island she emigrated from and no longer remembers. Her story mirrors that of many immigrants who left their homes in search of better opportunities for themselves and their family.
Sophia Contreras, a Watertown resident and journalism major at Central Connecticut State University, appreciated Díaz’s contribution to children’s literature. “We don’t have enough children’s books written about [minorities], and it’s important for kids to see somebody who looks just like them on a book so they can aspire to be that person. I think it’s good that [Díaz] writes adult books because these kids can read ‘Islandborn’ and then when they’re older, read another book [of his] that they can also be inspired by.”
Díaz also recounted the difficulty of writing a children’s book as a 50-year-old adult. “It’s easy to write a children’s book when you are young,” he said. “The older you get, the less magic you have, I think.” His perspective nevertheless resonated with his goddaughters. “I knew that I at least had reached my core audience because she finished the book and put her head down and wept, and wept,” he said. Because she knows what it means. Her family endured a lot of nonsense because of the dictatorship and post-dictatorship.”
Though the book has Dominican overtones, Díaz purposefully gave the Island its ambiguous name so that readers of different backgrounds could relate. “What makes fiction powerful is its ability to multiply depending on the readers; its multiplicity; the way that it holds different readings inside of itself,” he said. “On one hand, you can read this story and see it directly as a Dominican parable, a parable about Dominican dictatorship. Except that the story itself contains other readings, equally legitimate and in contradiction.”
Díaz explained that he wanted to reframe the narrative to highlight society’s forgotten and silenced heroes. Mr. Mir, the superintendent who works in Lola’s building, is one of the central heroes in “Islandborn.” For Díaz, his struggle reflects the imposed silence of the heroes whose stories remain untold. “You would have someone like Mr. Mir who was a hero who fought against the dictatorship, who fought against the Monster, but people would just spit on [him] that he was just a super[intendent]. And so many people in our lives are like this,” he said, referring to immigrants who never gain the social capital they would need to have their stories told, and in their own words.
Díaz’s insistence on giving voice to the voiceless extended to reality as well. As he opened up the discussion to audience members, he let women of African descent and children—people whose voices have systematically been silenced—ask questions before anyone else. One “young person” asked about the Monster’s—the book’s main antagonist—weakness. “The monster seems to be particularly afraid of people sticking together, you know?” Diaz said. “The way your family sticks together, the way your siblings stick together, the way your cousins, the way we’re all supposed to stick together. Old people have a word for that: We call it solidarity.”
For Díaz, the importance of telling Lola’s story is twofold. “Good art produces fantastic disagreement. By creating uncertainty and disagreement, it has a truth effect. I write the lie that tells the truth,” he said. “In 2016, 94% of all children’s books were written by white people,” he said, a statistic he pulled from a study he read. “The last time this country as a country, as an actual polity, had 94% white people was in 1680. Which means that we are living in a 2018 reality but our literary culture is inflicting us with 1680 level whiteness. This is a crime.” He concluded, “global whiteness is the greatest, most damaging criminal narcotic in circulation.”
Mercedes M. Soto, a Cambridge resident, agreed. “The importance of children of color—specifically girls of color—being able to see themselves as protagonists and being able to see themselves as actors, it gives them a different validity in terms of their experience, and that they exist, and that they’re not invisibilized… I loved what [Díaz] had to say about the fact that there’s such a paucity of writers of color writing for children of color. It’s something we have to change.”
For Díaz and other people of color, the stakes are high. But they need not be unwinnable. “We either shift this paradigm or there is no future for us,” Díaz said. “And that’s the bottom line… With the little power that I have, I’m going to throw my couple of plátanos in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He was larger than life—both physically and metaphorically—at a time when he wasn’t allowed to be. A dominant, unyielding black man garnering mass appeal sounds like the type of story white America wouldn’t be able to tell during the civil rights movement. But Otis Redding made it possible. Fortuitous circumstance, vivid style, passion, and unabashed humanity turned a long-shot hero into one of the most beloved popular singers of the 20th century.
Miracles come at a cost, however. Otis was tragically killed at the age of 26 when the plane he took on the way to a concert crashed into a lake. Prior to his death, however, he had accumulated so many songs that there was enough material for five posthumous album releases. On the first of these albums, “The Dock of the Bay,”  released Feb. 23, 1968, Otis laments, begrudges, celebrates, and awaits, but most importantly he transmits feeling. His every vibration becomes the vibration of the audience, and his mind unravels in such a way that even the most stubborn critic can’t deny his truthfulness. It was this truthfulness, fostered by disregard for traditional pop standards and powered by an exposed, electrifying voice, that allowed Otis to garner the attention necessary to influence an entire generation of music.
The American pop music scene was a difficult landscape to traverse for black artists during the civil rights movement. Becoming a crossover success—an artist who had appeal both among black and white audiences—often required the veiling of one’s skin color. As a result, most of the popular black music of the late 1950s and early 1960s was sculpted to avoid evoking the biggest fears of white America: black power and black (generally male) sex. Feminine artists—women like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, and men like Little Richard—managed to succeed without intimidating. Sam Cooke sang in a sweet, unaggressive tone, and even flamboyant front-man Chuck Berry famously changed the lyrics of Johnny B. Goode from “colored boy” to “country boy” to avoid offending. Although it’s impossible to deny these artists shaped pop culture to be more amenable to future black talent, their influence wasn’t significant enough to normalize the controversy of Otis Redding. How is it then, that a symbol of black male sex who sang with the pain of generations of his abused predecessors attained such positive critical reception?
The short answer: Otis lived his music. Listening to an Otis track feels like a real-time experience. His process is so natural and deconstructed that it’s easy to ignore considerations of race even while his gospel voice crashes into you. Nowhere is this better felt than in some of his takes from “The Dock of the Bay.” In “The Glory of Love,” the listener receives an unobstructed view of Otis’ internal state. The listener observes as Otis progresses from introspective, to vexed, then to a manic wailing of “You got to know what the glory is, the glory is.” He finishes the song with his trademark frenetic exultation of “gotta, gotta, gotta,” and the song abruptly ends. This song undermines the traditional structure of pop music—there is no hook and really no pattern. It’s Otis’ stream of consciousness as he spills his secrets. Even more subversive is the way the song builds into the end, with Otis sounding almost agitated moments before the song completes. The more overwhelmed Otis sounds on tracks, the harder it is to doubt his credibility.
Otis’ authenticity is on display throughout many other tracks on the album. Having previously been a blue-color laborer, he was truly an everyday person in the body of a star. His eschewing of stardom is evident on the title track of the album when he relates to the everyday person, promoting “I’m sittin’ on the dock of the bay / wastin’ time.” In the next song “I Love You More Than Words Can Say,” Otis strips himself of his ego and pleads with an ex-lover. He’s unpretentious as he admits he’s the one who is hurt and begs for another chance. It’s not just the content, but the form that’s so compelling. The slow trembling of his vibrato makes him vulnerable in a way that even the most personal lyrics couldn’t. He proves to audiences that they get his whole heart regardless of how sensitive the subject matter is. In “Open the Door,” Otis’ pace and pitch mirror his emotions, which results in mania and sadness juxtaposed in a way only an ultimate auteur could make feel natural. The song fades out in amplitude, but not attitude, with Otis just as fiery in the last second as in the first. Otis proves with song after song that he will give the audience everything he has because, frankly, he is not capable of doing otherwise.
Inspiring audiences was his forte, but Otis also inspired countless future stars with his frank, heartfelt delivery. His approach to music and his singing style influenced artists like The Doors, Aretha Franklin, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and Marvin Gaye. It should come as no surprise that his rugged style would influence many of these rock greats. Beyond his musical influence, Otis is deeply felt in the cultural arena. Popularizing a gospel brand of soul music created pathways for countless black artists to express themselves. Ostentatious showmen like Michael Jackson and Kanye West owe thanks to Otis for creating a space where they could thrive. Perhaps as thanks, Kanye immortalized Otis when he made the song “Otis,” which featured the legend’s grumbly vocals from “Try a Little Tenderness” as the bassline.
Otis didn’t follow tried and true methods of songwriting. Sometimes the denouement was the moment for excitation, and sometimes the hook was the moment for melancholy and cogitation. He could interrupt himself on a track without skipping a beat, and could fit more into a song than other artists could fit into an entire album. His voice was his music, and his soul was the purveyor of his message. He required nothing more than a couple of honks of the horn or basic guitar chords to produce unforgettable hits. Otis managed to popularize one of America’s blackest forms of music during one of the most racially contentious periods of the 20th century. When he went down in a plane on that fateful day in December 1967, America lost its heart, but the future kept its soul.

Danielle Nicole brings a fiery blues in her new album “Cry No More.” In her second studio album after 2015’s “Wolf Den,” Nicole, who originally cut her teeth with the family blues band Trampled Under Foot, takes on the album with both lead vocals and the bass. Since her days with the family band, Nicole has developed as a performer, from simpler blues melodies into more complex jams. Nicole especially shines as a bassist, incorporating funk and rock influenced blues bass lines and bold instrumental choices.
In terms of lyrics and themes, however, the album does leave some room for improvement. The album is far from unique. Danielle Nicole says on her website, “I think that people want to hear authentic music again.” This is a ludicrous claim, considering that every track on “Cry No More” other than “Poison the Well” is largely derivative of previous blues recordings in musical, lyrical, and production choices, as theft is nearly an instrument in and of itself within the blues genre. It is in this spirit of building on the work of previous blues artists that Nicole’s sophomore album as a solo performer is a success, yet in the spirit of innovation and creative divergence, it fails.
“Cry No More,” while ostensibly a capital ‘B’ blues album, draws from many other uniquely American musical traditions. Tracks such as “Someday You Might Change Your Mind,” “Save Me,” and “How Come You Don’t Call Me Anymore” are heavily steeped in southern rock, from steady rhythmic drums to a church organ. Blues music has always been heavily influenced by the geography of its musicians and listeners: From the sparse syncopated Mississippi delta blues, to the crunchy electric blues of Chicago, American blues music has always served as a reflection of local style and swagger. Nicole’s blues is no exception. She has been influenced by contemporaries in a swath of genres including southern rock, soft rock, hard rock, and americana. The album’s seventh track, “Bobby,” brings a certain old-timey americana charm to the otherwise fiery album. Filled with softer strumming patterns, minimal drums, finger plucked strings, and some good old country vocals, “Bobby” injects a wave of cool into generally hot-tempered lyrical and instrumental choices on the album. Just as Nicole is influenced by genres outside of blues, she is equally beholden to those blues greats who have come before her in the American blues tradition. The album’s second track, “I’m Going Home,” pays homage to Robert Johnson’s iconic blues masterpiece, “Cross Road Blues,” with the opening line, “Leave me at the crossroads, tears in my eye.” Overall, Nicole blends styles both old and new throughout the album in an admirable attempt at “authentic” music.
Although “Cry No More” may not be an album that alters or even effects the course of blues music as a whole, it is nonetheless a solid contribution to the field, and an enjoyable listen. Danielle Nicole has succeeded not as a visionary, but as a proficient and passionate practitioner of the great American blues tradition.

With a band name like “Hippie Sabotage,” one might imagine bluegrass music from tree-hugging, long haired, tie-dye t-shirt clad members. While the appearances of the brother-duo Kevin and Jeff Saurer more or less fits that image, the artists engaged the audience dynamically with their music at their Mar. 2 concert at Boston’s House of Blues.
Like other EDM artists, Hippie Sabotage accentuates the bass in their music. But where other artists often have electronica sounds, Hippie Sabotage interlaced their music with varying instruments and voices instead. At the House of Blues, the crowd was clearly dedicated to the band, and Hippie Sabotage knew it, too—they dropped off and gave the crowd the chance to fill in measures of almost every song, and the audience never failed to shout the lyrics.
Hippie Sabotage’s take on Halsey’s “Gasoline,” which took a few lines from the lyrics of “High Enough,” is much better live than on recording. The recording lacks personality and sounds repetitive, while the the crowd’s anticipation of the popular song live brought out an otherwise missing energy from to the song. In their cover of Tove Lo’s “Habits (Stay High),” the Sauerers stood back and let their music do most of the work to engage their crowd.
Though the duo usually stands out because of the production and rich sounds in their music, “Different” contains a more thoughtful message in its lyrics. They say, “But the world never change when you wanna change/ And the people never say what you wanna say/ So go and live your life like you don’t give a fuck.”. The soft sounds add a relaxed feeling to the song, further reinforcing the band’s carefree attitude.
Just as the electronica dance vibes seemed to plateau and slow down, Jeff whipped out a guitar for a skillful and mellow performance of “Waiting Too Long.” Simple chords and a deep bass resonated through the venue as sepia-filtered shots of the brothers lounging on the crowd phase in and out in the background, under orange lights that warm both the color of the stage and the tone of the sound.
Despite a program with music from over four years of repertoire, the band maintained a loyal group of fans. Interweaving low-key melodies with intense dance beats took the audience on a colorful ride through Hippie Sabotage’s range of music. The signature drop-off-and-build-up successfully sustained the crowd energy, elevating it (in most songs) right before the beat dropped. The interludes sound the most like trap pieces you’d hear in a typical hip-hop concert, but what sets Hippie Sabotage apart from other EDM is not the bass and the beat drops. It’s their hip-swaying, head-bobbing tunes that come from their instruments, voices, and lyrics.

John R. Lewis, prominent civil rights leader and congressman, was recently named this year’s Commencement speaker. Considering everything he’s accomplished throughout his life, especially during the civil rights movement and in Congress, his presence at Commencement is very timely amidst ongoing racial tensions in our country. Good choice, Harvard.
Now I know the process for choosing future commencement speakers is complex, and I’m sure potential speakers are intensely vetted for exceptional achievements and personal characteristics. I hope somebody involved in this process is reading this right now, because I have a question for you: Have you heard of Dolly Parton?
She’s often called the Queen of Country—and after racking up dozens of awards and two world records over her decades-long music and entertainment career, the title is well-deserved. Parton grew up poor in a family of a dozen children in rural Tennessee, and even as a child she knew she wanted to be a country singer. She moved to Nashville as a teenager to pursue that dream, and after several years of hard work, she finally broke into the music business. Many chart-topping songs and several acclaimed movies followed over the years, and Parton became the star she’d always wanted to be.
I’m a sucker for a good rags-to-riches story, and I grew up idolizing Parton—she was the fierce and feisty Appalachian woman I wanted to become, the kind of woman who overcame obstacles and achieved her dreams with hard work and willpower. If I wanted to be successful, I’d have to start from the ground up, too. But it isn’t just Parton’s success story that makes her a good candidate for Commencement; some of her most impressive qualities (and she has a lot of them) are best seen off the stage.
Parton has been a dedicated philanthropist for years, focusing much of her giving on educational success. She established The Dollywood Foundation in 1988 as an effort to decrease dropouts rates among students in Sevierville, Tennessee, her hometown. In the early 1990s, The Buddy Program, which promised $500 of Parton’s own money to each seventh and eighth grader who graduated high school in Sevier County, led to a 29 percent reduction in the dropout rate for those classes. The Foundation also funds five $15,000 scholarships for Sevier County college-bound seniors, one for a student at each of the county’s high schools.
Parton then founded the Imagination Library in 1995 to send children in Sevier County a free book each month until they turn five years old. She was inspired by her father, who never learned to read or write, to start the initiative, which quickly expanded across Tennessee and then across America. It is now available to children in several foreign countries. In just 23 years, the small community charity has expanded worldwide and distributed millions of free books; in fact, Parton donated the Imagination Library’s 100 millionth book to the Library of Congress last month.
Those accomplishments alone are beyond impressive—I can barely fathom such a number—but Parton’s giving doesn’t stop there. In 2016, when wildfires destroyed homes in Sevier County, Parton established the My People Fund to distribute millions of dollars to almost a thousand displaced families over a period of six months. She’s also donated to many other charities and often donates anonymously.
Parton’s self-made rise to fame and success, especially from such humble beginnings, is a story of inspiration just perfect for Commencement. She actually spoke a bit about her life at the University of Tennessee’s commencement in 2009, when she was awarded an honorary doctorate.
I think we at Harvard need to hear it, too; it’s a good reminder to stay humble, dream big, and work hard for what you want. I know that’s a pretty stereotypical graduation message, but we could hear stand to hear it from a unique perspective: Harvard has hosted few women, few entertainers, and few Southerners in its long history of past commencements. In addition, Parton’s dedication to philanthropy—especially in her own hometown—is a great reminder to give back and remember your roots. When you come from somewhere small and rural, you grow up itching to get out and find the opportunities you never had. Parton left, made it big, and went back to help the place that helped her get so far, the place that made her what she was. I think that each of us has the responsibility to use our education and opportunities to improve our communities and the lives of the people that helped get us here in the first place.
If you need even more convincing, take a few minutes to watch Parton on stage (or better yet, watch the entirety of her hit film “Steel Magnolias”). She’s tiny in stature but her personality is larger than life, and she’s as genuine as they come. She radiates wisdom—kind that comes from turning struggle into success.
Harvard, Dolly Parton is the whole package, and I think we could learn a few important lessons from her life. I hope you’ll consider her for Commencement.

For the entirety of my college experience, I’ve eschewed the dramatic international destinations of my peers—Beijing, Barcelona, St. Barts. Instead, every chance I get, I go home to Baltimore.
I don’t get white sand beaches or a dramatic skyline featuring the tallest skyscrapers in the world. After landing at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, I drive by old factories with dark, broken-in windows and vacant houses. I look out the window at the Harbor, calm in the distance, and the blocky Baltimore Sun building, right by I-95. I’m home.
But not quite. My drive continues past the city, past the broken glass, into Baltimore County. I pull into a neighborhood where the average household income is six figures and the homes are pristine, with manicured lawns and the occasional backyard pool. Nestled between a forest, a park, and shiny new cookie cutter houses in the making, it’s picture-perfect suburbia. Every morning, the neighborhood is disturbed by a small army bearing brightly colored bookbags, lining up the sidewalk as parents peer out of minivans, watching their children board the elementary school bus.
Baltimore City may be 20 miles away from this bubble, but it defines me. Baltimore defines how I speak (and especially how my high school-aged brother, who sometimes has to translate his slang for me, speaks). Baltimore defines what I eat, the jokes I make, the music I listen to. Baltimore is home to some of my favorite restaurants and favorite memories, including multiple experiences of getting lost in narrow streets with friends (one time at night). Baltimore’s museums and aquariums were my first field trips and first explorations. Baltimore is where I’m from.
And so, here at Harvard, I defend it in a way I’ve never had to. Unlike other cities, I say, Baltimore is relevant. It’s critical to this nation’s history: it was one of the most important ports in the nation and was the site of the battle that inspired the Star-Spangled Banner. It is home to one of the best universities and hospital systems in America. It has given birth or shelter to America’s greatest thinkers, including Edgar Allan Poe, W.E.B. Du Bois, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thurgood Marshall, and John Rawls. (I bet more than half those names surprise you.) Even today, the tradition of excellence continues, from Ta-Nehisi Coates to Oprah to Michael Phelps. (Yes, even Oprah has a Baltimore connection.)
But my friends in Cambridge all give me the same look. They know Baltimore’s reputation. And so do I. Because it is also a city with a history of race riots and corrupt policing. It is a city with segregated housing, where one of four residents live in what can be described as a “food desert.” It is a city with public schools so underfunded that earlier this winter, students sat shivering in classrooms. It is a city that the Economist labeled “exceptionally murderous” and USA Today named “the nation’s most dangerous,” due to the homicide rate, which is the highest in America.
Though Baltimore County isn’t perfect (except when it comes to college basketball), it is an ivory tower in comparison. And I mean this quite literally—65 percent of the county is white, while a nearly identical percentage of the city is black. That dichotomy is impossible to ignore, as it shapes how those in the county dehumanize and degrade the city, even while they benefit from it and appropriate its culture. More so than physical miles, this socio-political dichotomy is the distance.
Distance exists here at Harvard too, where I am living in an ivory tower once again. One step outside of the intricate gates and weighty prestige and towering history of Harvard Yard reveals to me the broken sidewalks and present poverty and flawed reality of Cambridge. Cambridge, too, is a city that suffers from a lack of affordable housing and that has a rising homeless population, a city that lacks the pristine shine of its more privileged neighbors.
Even though the distance between me and the rest of Cambridge is simply a few feet, the gap feels just as wide as the miles that separate my house from Baltimore City. While my peers and I benefit from the culture of the Baltimore, we are warned away from it. We dehumanize its residents, equate it to a warzone, treat it with disgust. While my peers and I benefit from restaurants and malls and public libraries in Cambridge, we are warned away. We avert our eyes as we rush past the homeless in Harvard Square. We never explore the streets or rivers of Cambridge. Some of us never even ride the train, whose station is prominent right outside of Harvard Yard.
Instead, for too many of us, it’s easier to hop in an Uber and head to Logan Airport for an exotic vacation on the other side of the world than it is to walk down to Central Square to actually see and understand the city we live in. We came to college wanting to see the world and change it for the better. Yet upon arrival, we immediately depart, traveling thousands of miles looking for what is right under our noses.
My cities are vibrant and real and brimming with so much potential. They aren’t ivory—they’re black and brown, and that’s even better. They aren’t pristine—they are cracked and broken in some places. But they are filled with nooks and crannies worth exploring. They are filled with people who want change and who work towards improvement. Many of these people are Harvard students, and you I commend and admire and join.
I have a lifetime of home in Baltimore. I still have two years left here in Cambridge. And though I can’t move out of my ivory tower, I am determined to step out from time to time.
Join me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the College shifted toward a policy of providing students who are staying on campus over spring break with Crimson Cash, rather than the cash stipends that were available the previous year. Then-Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich noted then that the College was “piloting different approaches to support students during breaks.” The College has since stuck with Crimson Cash, however, and it is unclear if they are considering a different approach.
Following the departure of Liquiteria and Boloco from Harvard Square, the number of food options for using Crimson Cash off-campus has dwindled down to just eight restaurants and eateries, along with CVS. Neither of the eateries that replaced Liquiteria and Boloco—Pokéworks and Zambrero—currently accepts or has publicly indicated plans to accept Crimson Cash in the future. Of those eight off-campus locations, two options, Sami’s Wrap & Roll and H-Mart, are located at the Longwood Medical School campus and in Central Square, respectively, making them difficult to access for most students on campus. Beyond that, Henrietta’s Table is less than affordable, especially for students looking to stretch $25 a day across three meals. The Clover in the Science Center, one of the few external vendors currently operating on Harvard’s campus, does not yet accept Crimson Cash, despite a promise from its CEO and founder Ayr Muir in Sept. 2017 that the location would accept Crimson Cash “soon.” Greenhouse Cafe, which Clover replaced following the renovation of the Science Center, previously accepted both Crimson Cash and BoardPlus.
The options for on-campus dining aren’t much better. While the Crimson Cash website lists a plethora of on-campus food options, few were open over spring break. In an email sent to students who received the spring break grant, just six retail dining operations were listed as being open during the break: those at Northwest Labs, the Kennedy School, the School of Public Health, Bauer, the LISE Center, and the Observatory Cart. The School of Public Health is far from the Cambridge campus, leaving just five options for students in the Square, all with limited hours. Notably, none of these locations are open for dinner, with two locations only serving coffee and pastries and most of the locations closing before 3 p.m.
While some Houses and offices like the Bureau of Study Council hosted meals for students on campus, these events were far and few between and certainly not enough to sustain students throughout break. It is unacceptable for students who are on campus over the break to have different levels of access to dining options just on the basis of the House in which they live. Moreover, freshmen had the opportunity to borrow kitchen equipment as part of the Freshman Dean’s Office’s rental program, but upperclass students were not afforded that same luxury, and many House kitchens don’t have their own cooking supplies.
On top of the shortcomings of the Crimson Cash system, this past week’s inclement weather further inconvenienced students staying on campus. Not only were events rescheduled, like the BSC’s pizza lunch, but the weather made getting to on-campus dining options more difficult, and a variety of off-campus options closed as a result of the weather.
Harvard University Dining Services staff deserve time off, and keeping dining halls open over the break may not be a feasible option to increase food options for students on campus over break. Offering students cash grants, hosting more meals for students in the Houses or at University offices, or increasing the number of locations that accept Crimson Cash would be concrete steps the College can take towards addressing the difficulty students face when they remain on campus for breaks.
Not being able to afford to travel or go home over break is already ostracizing enough for under-resourced students; limiting food options for those same students is even worse. If the College is truly committed to increasing socioeconomic diversity at Harvard, it is obligated to put its money where its mouth is and genuinely support those students once they get to campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” Harvard’s introductory computer science course, recently made changes to its course policies. These changes, after the high number of academic dishonesty cases from fall 2016, include collaboration with an Academic Integrity Fellow, a required session dedicated to the discussion of academic honesty, and a “near occasion of sin” policy that allows students to receive extensions on assignments if they explain that they need more time because they would otherwise be tempted to cheat. While we commend the efforts of the class instructors to address academic integrity issues in the course, we believe that the solutions are minor fixes at best, and, at worst, exacerbate some of the problems at the core of the course’s approach to pedagogy and curriculum.
We recognize that computer science courses face a particularly daunting challenge when it comes preventing academic dishonesty. The culture of coding and software engineering itself is one of collaboration and code sharing. CS50 must balance this culture with the reality that there is no way to effectively ensure comprehension of course material without the assurance that the work students complete is their own.
For this reason, the course’s expectations encourage “incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code” or sending friends one’s code when students are struggling on assignments, but prohibit viewing someone else’s code in the same situation. In the same vein, the structure of the course is also affected by this duality. Tests and quizzes are take-home, open-book, and open-Internet, but the only human help that you may receive is from the course heads.
CS50 summarizes its policy on academic honesty as “be reasonable.” This vague mantra and the policies that follow it ignore the fundamental issues with CS50 that make it prone to cases of academic dishonesty. The supposed balance kept in the course between the realities of modern coding and the integrity of each student’s work has at times left students confused.
Furthermore, CS50’s structural issues are only compounded by the fact that the course, as one of the most popular at the College, may lack the capacity to provide adequate support to its students, many of whom are first-semester freshmen who are adjusting to life at Harvard. Indeed, the course does not emphasize consistent, in-person support to students. Lecture attendance is “encouraged” but still optional, while section attendance is only mandatory until the midterm.
At the core of the problem are course policies that exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the pressures and confusion that lead some students to feel compelled to cheat. Nevertheless, the recently introduced changes—especially the "near occasion to sin" policy—do not address any of the aforementioned issues or work toward their solutions. We thus strongly oppose this new policy, as it ignores all of the fundamental cultural, expectational, and structural problems that cause academic dishonesty in the course. The policies of working with an Academic Integrity Fellow and requiring students to attend a session on academic dishonesty too fall prey to the same problem.
Ultimately, we believe that cheating—once clearly defined—should be unequivocally prohibited at Harvard. We especially oppose the new “near occasion of sin” policy on the grounds that it sends the message that Harvard considers cheating something to be negotiated, rather than something that is wholly unacceptable.
Instead, in order to combat the pressing issue of academic dishonesty in its computer science courses, we urge the Computer Science department to rethink its introduction to the field from scratch, with close attention being paid to making expectations clear and creating better support from instructors and staff.

“For Hurricane Sandy, while people were running to the grocery stores, trampling each other over bread and water and batteries and all that stuff, my family and I were sitting in our living room watching Netflix,” Sandy L. Smith explains. “We weren’t concerned with getting to the store to get that last loaf of bread or gallon of milk.”
Smith is more commonly known in prepping circles by his YouTube handle, The Massachusetts Prepper, with accompanying slogan, “More then just a prepper” (sic).
Since the late ’90s, Smith has been prepping—installing a rack in his basement that can hold 660 cans of food, learning how to grow his own crops, buying water filtration systems, and taking dozens of other precautions to sustain him and his family if a natural or manmade disaster hits their Western Massachusetts home. (He would not get any more specific than Western Mass, for fear of being “targeted.”) While Smith now has enough canned and dehydrated rations to sustain his family of seven for a year, he’s less focused on a “SHTF” (Shit Hits the Fan) situation and more on preparing for short-term natural disasters, like the Bomb Cyclone and Hurricane Sandy. It’s not that all “preppers” believe the rats scurrying across major cities are carrying the next bubonic plague or that a comet is currently hurtling towards the Earth, promising a dinosaur-type extinction—rather, Smith and his ilk “expect the worst and hope for the best.”
According to the American Preppers Network, a prepper is a “person who earnestly believes that no challenge is insurmountable with the proper dedication, determination and focus.” In online forums and Reddit groups, these believers swap tips on how to survive a variety of different apocalypses.
Determined to find a community of preppers, Smith started a prepping-focused YouTube channel in 2014 with the aim of “sharing ideas, learning from others, and teaching others.” Smith reviews prepping materials—like Pine Fire campfire starter materials, Vita Pure Products Advanced Digestive Enzymes, the Fitbit Blaze—to help other preppers discern which materials are worth adding to their stash. Why the Fitbit? “If you’re not in good shape your chance of survival is slim to none.”
Though the community aims to circulate information, cooperation is limited. Many preppers don’t disclose their identities even to fellow preppers because, according to Smith, “as a prepper you will become a target in a worse-case scenario.” He clarifies: “At 10 days, people start killing someone for a can of beans. As a prepper... people will try and seek you out because you have what they need.” This tension leads to a conflict of interest; members of the prepper network are all working towards a shared goal—to survive—but they must necessarily prioritize individual survivorship.
“Morgan Rogue” is one prepper who was unwilling to reveal her real name. “Rogue” is her prepper pseudonym, under which she runs Rogue Preparedness, a website and YouTube channel. Her website’s plain black text urges viewers to “conquer tomorrow, by preparing today!”
Rogue is less concerned about people identifying her from her face, but she knows several YouTubers who don’t show their faces. “How secretive they want to be” is each member’s personal preference. For Rogue, safety means concealing her last name and displaying only a portion of her emergency supplies—and those precautions don’t hinder her relationships with other preppers. Despite the wariness, they’re “mostly good people,” she says.
Rogue has mastered the slingshot and runs mock-nuclear fallout drills—though not in an “obsessive” way—but hiding her identity seems to her like a step too far. It’s more important to her “to have a support group, because if something does happen, who are you going to rely on besides yourself and your family?”  Rogue’s voice rises: “It’s all these people who want to get together and share and be a support system for each other.” For many, the prepper community is much more than a series of pixelated cartoon icons responding to forum posts once in awhile: It’s a band of people whose survival-themed feedback and camaraderie can turn a materially prepared prepper into an emotionally prepared prepper.
The Canadian Prepper, who signs his emails as “Nate,” runs one of the most popular prepper channels on YouTube with over 110,000 subscribers. He points to the absurdity of many preppers’ protectiveness: They “put up a YouTube video and it gets 1,000 views. They get worried that of the 7 billion people in the world, those 1,000 people are going to somehow know where they live. It’s ridiculous.” But in a community of people united by a preoccupation with the unlikely, slim odds can preoccupy.
Like many preppers, Nate can pinpoint a specific moment that sent him into the world of disaster preparedness. A few years ago, he realized he was so dependent on technology that he’d be utterly helpless if the grid went down. So his videos often focus on prepping for power outages and the grid failing instead of on the larger-scale disasters that obsess many other preppers—like nuclear apocalypse. Prepping for nuclear war or a doomsday triggered by North Korea, he says, is “sort of silly.” It’s the prepper community’s focus on silliness and hyperbole that prompted him to create his channel: “I’m not [making videos] in a way that makes the community looks like a bunch of nutcases. There are people out there that are loose cannons—that’s why there’s a stigma to prepping.”
The Canadian Prepper works as a mental health counselor, and he says “there is no diagnosable” mental health condition for preppers—at most, “just more anxiety” than the average person. He points to a double standard in how preppers are perceived by non-preppers. “If anybody looked rationally at the things people occupy themselves with today—sports and dumb memes people do on YouTube and what used to be Vine—what is our definition of insanity when people can spend tens of thousands of dollars on season tickets to watch some people throw a ball around on a court? Yet if you spend that money on ways you can self-preserve, that’s viewed as insane?”
But each prepper has a different vision of the ultimate SHTF scenario and adjusts their privacy accordingly. Preppers aren’t so much preparing for one event as much as recognizing the list of possible catastrophes is never-ending. “Rellgar,” a V.I.P., moderator, senior member, and staff member of Doomsday Forum, declined to comment because “no real prepper would give an interview without being anonymous.” The only details about Rellgar are listed below his username: his favorite weapon (a Daisy .177 BB with night scope) and what he’s prepping for (economic collapse). It’s hard to see just a weapon and a doomsday scenario as a potential friend.

When Juan C. Peña ’19 answered a call from an unknown number, he didn’t expect it to be one of his YouTube commenters. Peña’s channel is called Changemakers, via which he allows viewers to follow “a 20 year old finding his place in the world,” according to his channel description.
He’s not kidding around—viewers can watch daily vlogs where he bangs a notebook filled with brainstormed company names against his head, yells “What the hell, Boston?”, skateboards through the snow, and teaches “HOW TO SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS - Life Hack” in the span of four minutes and 16 seconds. Peña views his channel as part of his mission to spread positivity, as well as a journal of his own entrepreneurial and personal endeavors. "That's the vibe I want to put out into the world, and if someone can pick up on that positive vibe then maybe they'll feel the same way," Peña says.
He never expected these efforts to reach past the digital and turn into a real, live voice on the line. The unexpected caller found Peña’s personal website, clicked on his resume, and dialed up his number, introducing himself as a commenter who wanted to follow up on a college admissions inquiry. “I don't mind it at all because if he wants to be at a point I was blessed enough to be [at], I'm like, ‘Hey, that's great,’" Peña says of the call.
He’s not alone: Harvard’s student vloggers find themselves in the unique position of attending the College and maintaining an online platform. These undergraduates share both their own academic and personal experiences with viewers, knowing many of those who watch their videos are prospective students looking for insider information.
The vloggers’ videos, class years, and backgrounds may vary, but their viewers do not. Watchers’ comments seem to idolize Harvard with words like “hope,” “dream,” and “wish,” along with countless heart-eyes emojis. The vloggers cater to an audience that requests all Harvard coverage, all the time.
And the vloggers really bring the goods. TheDanLife (Daniel M. Ayane ’19) has a channel advertising videos that claim to provide a look at the Harvard Experience, with titles like “A Typical Day in the Life of a Harvard Freshman Student” reaching up to 74,000 views.
Ayane’s channel also offers dorm tours, question-and-answer sessions with students, and college admissions advice. Inspired by University of Cambridge vlogger Jake Wright, Ayane initially created his channel as a tool to show off daily university life, similar to those he found helpful during his own application process. He felt there was a steep learning curve for international students applying to Ivy League schools—one he wanted to reduce, as an international student from England himself.
He was taken aback by how many students thanked him for his instructional videos on applying to Harvard. “The common person in America,” he says, “knows the Common App, FAFSA. But for a guy in Sweden, it’s like, ‘Who’s FAFSA?’”
Ayane believes there is a myth surrounding the Harvard student that he tries to dispel. "They think it's a bunch of really rich kids, [boasting] about how rich they are, little do they know it's actually me... playing football, playing FIFA."
In contrast to the DSLRs and tripods of other YouTubers, Ayane often films on his phone, preferring its “authenticity,” citing his “aesthetic” as “crappy quality videos.” He clarifies: “Not a crappy guy... [it’s] just more authentic to keep it my style."
Other Harvard vloggers treat their videos as curated, cinematic experiences. John A. Fish ’21 develops his video topics for two to three weeks, scripts them, and storyboards them all before he even starts filming, which can take another six to eight hours. His videos occupy a middle ground between the relentless positivity of Peña’s motivational slogans and the frank, to-the-point advice of Ayane’s uploads.
Fish claims to promote self-improvement and personal growth: He encourages people “to be realistic and passionate about something and just be the best version of themselves that they can be.” Some videos tout thought-provoking titles like “MY GROWTH MINDSET.” Videos like these earn 4,000 views, paling in comparison to the 161,000 views videos with titles like “HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD” earn. The student vloggers say there is sometimes a discrepancy between the types of content vloggers want to make and the type of content their target audience wants to see.
“70 percent of my viewers are under 25,” Fish says. The clearly defined target audience renders Harvard’s vloggers attractive to tutoring companies. Ayane, for example, has been approached by several educational startups eager to take advantage of the Harvard hopefuls who watch his videos, but he has turned them down.
Fellow YouTuber and current alumna, Taylor M. Reneau ’16, is perhaps the most influential of the group, boasting over 100,000 subscribers. While her earlier videos offered her perspective on topics ranging from Harvard social life to study tips, she has shifted after graduation to producing videos that keep Harvard in the periphery. Reneau acknowledges this change, comparing herself to a Disney Channel star trying to break out of her childhood shell. She jokes: "I’m more than just a Harvard student trying to talk about school, so I draw people in with academics and keep people for the cool personality.”
Fish claims the Harvard name “for sure” helps with his view count, but tries to keep his channel from becoming too Harvard-centric, believing he can’t teach people to “game” the college admissions system. Nonetheless, that seems to be exactly what people want.
Peña is currently in correspondence with several subscribers via email who are seeking college admissions advice, so he witnesses the stress of prospective students firsthand. “When I don’t reply within 24 hours, a lot of them send me five emails at a time, just like, ‘Hey, are you there, are you there,’ and I get it.” He remembers when he applied to college and says he “can definitely see [himself] wanting get a step up, whatever step up you can get.”
Peña isn’t the only Harvard YouTuber who receives admissions questions. Commenters list their extracurriculars for Ayane, asking whether they’re “‘good enough to get into Harvard.’” In response, Ayane says “I'm like, 'Yeah, just keep what you're doing man, I have no idea.'
We all got in here and we have no bloody idea how.”
Harvard’s vloggers don’t claim to have all the answers. But their videos keep thousands watching, just in case they do.

In this installment of my column, FM staff writer Alicia M. Chen and I talk to each other about the performance art projects we undertook together in the fall. We were both in a class that required us to perform a performance art piece for all of November. AMC posted every waking hour of every day, on the hour, on a public Instagram account. If she missed an hour, she’d have to post twice the next. The photos had to reflect her daily life. My project was to dig holes everyday. I mostly dug by the Charles River, and usually at night. I’d keep the soil.
AMC: My project wasn't supposed to be about gender in the first place, but I realized the role of gender while the project was going on. I think there is an expectation as to how women should spend their days and nights, and then put that on social media for people to see. That was something that I had to grapple with, because I wasn't sure if I fit into that, or if I even should fit into that. I came into the project without thinking that I needed to portray anything—it was my life. But then I realized that within every hour there's still some kind of picking and choosing. What about yours?
EKR: My project was ostensibly about land use and land ownership. But as I spent time with the dirt, I started thinking a lot about traditional femininity, where women are supposed to be light, pure, wispy. Our professor told me about this anthropological phenomenon of women eating dirt all over the world, and I started thinking about that all the time. It felt like this subversion of femininity as cleanliness and loveliness. It’s so hard to articulate why this became about gender for me, because it was a time of trying to configure thoughts about queerness and what gender meant to me and what type of womanhood I wanted to be associated with. Interacting with the dirt, for me, became this proxy for interacting with non-traditional forms of femininity.
AMC: It's hard to articulate how gender relates to everything. I’m looking for these words that I can't actually find.
EKR: So you ended up having a kind of shitty month.
AMC: Oh, I had a terrible month. It mostly sucked because I was doing something each hour that I didn't want to, but I did anyway. Knowing constantly that there would always be someone knowing, based on what I posted, where I was, what I was doing, what classes I was in—at one point there were 150 followers who would see exactly where I was. That was new to me, and something that I increasingly grew uncomfortable with. In terms of the content, an hour is hard to sum up, and so is choosing one picture to sum up your week or your month, which is the way most of us use social media. Also, following a schedule was hard. I messed up a lot. A lot.
EKR: Is there a version of yourself that you wanted to perform?
AMC: I had to decide what daily life meant. Even though going out was something I did, I wasn't more familiar with that than with brushing my teeth. It weirded me out, how much I thought about it, but I couldn't put my finger on why I actually cared about it. And at the end I'd just post a picture of a fucking banana. With peanut butter on it.
EKR: And you didn't tell anyone you were doing an art project.
AMC: I didn't. People were really weirded out. A lot of people unfollowed me. It would have been different if I had—people would have been more forgiving.
EKR: We want to explain ourselves.
AMC: To rationalize, because we all want to be normal and accepted.
EKR: I remember you once posted an ugly selfie and it was kind of a big deal.
AMC: Well, posting a selfie was something I'd never done in general. For something to be a selfie, it's posted with the conscious knowledge that you took this, because you wanted a picture of your face, instead of another picture your friend took because they wanted to capture the moment.
EKR: Which is another kind of explaining ourselves. Do you remember the artist Amalia Ulman?
AMC: Yes. She became increasingly insane on her Instagram, and then increasingly normal. She was the reason I chose this project. I was really fascinated by the way she constructed this long term narrative over social media. She was telling a story, and people don't usually think of Instagram as telling a story. Our posts are so constructed but so believable. What was your month like?
EKR: I didn't end up following all my rules either, because it got so cold! And the ground got so hard! Mine was different because it was so private. I didn't tell many people. I think that’s because it didn't feel quirky-weird, it just felt bizarre, knowing that I was digging, and everyone was in the Yard—in this period of adjustment here that was like, what do people do at Harvard? What do people do to be successful here? And what am I doing? And why I am doing this strange thing that is so unrelated to what women are supposed to do at Harvard?
AMC: So different from what women do at Harvard.
EKR: I think that's something both of our projects dealt with: with representation of daily female life, what life looks like versus what it should.
AMC: What do you think femininity looks like at Harvard?
EKR: It's a good question. I actually have a much more distinct vision of what men are supposed to look like here.
AMC: Right, with women it’s so varied. I think there isn't a specific mold, but there is an expectation of dualism—someone who's playing into expected gender roles but also has an element of independence, a detached, I-can-have-two-things-at-once femininity. There's this idea that you're here because you're accomplished, you have a lot of options in terms of academics, but you’re also going to be who men want you to be.
EKR: One thing was that a big part of my interaction here first semester was around grooming and preparation. And that meant the opposite of dirtiness—the expectation of cleanliness, but also something beyond cleanliness—the literal removal of all things “extraneous” on a woman’s body, of all texture. It's also a time of a lot of anticipation, preparing oneself for things. And that felt antithetical to my digging, this act that was, first of all, unfeminine, but also something I was doing alone, and not to serve anything else. No product, no furthering of a relationship or furthering of my work. It wasn’t a skill—just a task. And life here in general is task-averse. We don’t cook our meals or clean our plates or walk more than seven minutes to a class.
AMC: More of an individual stride for self achievement, while the college eliminates all of your other responsibilities for you.
EKR: Exactly, and this was weird and reflective and not goal-oriented. So your account, it wasn’t like a finsta.
AMC: It wasn't like a finsta whatsoever. My mom somehow found it, and once I was doing my radio show at 5 a.m. and she texted me and said, “Alicia, you have to quit radio, you can't be up at 5 a.m.” So then I wouldn't post late at night. And then I stopped staying up that late, anyway. My life started following my posting.
EKR:  Oh yeah, it would come up everywhere. I remember reading “One Hundred Years of Solitude” in Hum 10, and there was this character who ate dirt, just as I was learning about this, and she was this ferocious little girl. Everyone would try to stop her and she would kick and scream, and I thought, exactly!
AMC: It's interesting, the idea of eating something from the ground. There's this egg called “century egg” in Chinese cuisine. How you make it is take raw duck egg and put it in the ground. The white of the eggs turns solid and translucent, and the yolk becomes spreadable. There is a long history of putting things in the ground and using it for preservation. There's an idea that the ground is permanent. A way to keep things when there's no way to keep things.

It’s stupid cold out today, this March morning with the sky frozen cloudless glacier-blue. The bitter wind and whining bagpipes of the Saint Patrick’s Day parade turns my face numb. I’m desperately clutching two slices of pizza, jostled to and fro among the low-slung buildings of South Boston.
Here, at the intersection of Broadway and Dorchester Street, college students and families and grey-haired men line the street, shouting and watching the parade go by. I keep stepping on empty Bud Light cans. Someone blows mango-flavored Juul smoke on my first slice, so I’m not too mad when an unseen thief snatches it off my plate and disappears into the emerald-clad crowd.
I, nibbling on my last piece, unfortunately manage to catch the eye of a ring of very drunk dudes. All of them wear variations of the Celtics jersey and hoodie and backwards cap theme that’s common here. One of them, sporting novelty glasses that read “IRISH” (the eyeholes are in the R and S), begins a chant: “EAT THAT SHIT! EAT THAT SHIT!” They all join in. I smile nervously and pick the mushrooms off my pizza. Somehow the capital letters are audible. I soon get used to this.
I never quite understood St. Patrick’s Day. I have hazy elementary school memories of a frantic search for something—anything—green to wear before that day in school; of teachers’ vague, smirking allusions to Guinness and classmates asking, jokingly, if I was Irish. So I figured visiting Boston’s famed St. Patrick’s Day parade—held first in 1737, the oldest such celebration in the world—might help.
A Bostonian friend warned me: “It’s a lot.”
***
The chaos begins at Park Street. There are a few obvious parade-goers on the T when I board at Harvard Square, wearing green shirts and socks and shamrock face paint, but it’s only when we reach Park Street that I see what my friend warned me about: the platform packed with revelers waving green garlands, the pushing, shoving, yelling as the T doors open and the car fills. A mass of high schoolers—more of the jersey-hoodie-backwards cap crowd—begins shouting.
“Hey, we’re all here, man!” a redhead begins. I’ve managed to nab a seat, and I can see only the shirt of the woman standing in front of me. Adorned with white shamrocks, it reads “Bad and Boozey”.
“We’re all so tight right now,” another adds, ambiguously.
A brief silence falls. I hear the snap-crack of a Juul hit somewhere. I see a teen raise his face above the mob and howl to the ceiling, “Hi, my name is Brandon, and my favorite color is green!”
The crowd likes this: A “Yeah!” in unison.
Then: “Hi, my name is Chad and my favorite color is actually green,” shouts another. Another “Yeah!”
We’re not even at Downtown Crossing yet. A vape cloud emerges from the herd, a sudden whale spout that lingers in the sallow T light. A gangly teenager wearing a Vancouver Grizzlies jersey climbs a pole and cries, “I’m Jared, and I hate my family!”
“Yeah!”
Finally, as we approach Broadway, “Seventh Nation Army” chants break out, followed by a half-hearted “Ireland! Ireland!” that quickly dies out. The car grinds to a halt, but the call-and-response continues. “HO-LEE-FUCK! BOSTON BABY, LET’S GO!” a thick Boston accent shouts as we surge outwards. Let’s go, indeed.

St. Patrick’s Day is, ostensibly, a cultural and religious celebration held on March 17 every year. Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, is widely believed to have brought Christianity to Ireland. Diasporic Irish communities, like those in Boston and New York, popularized the day of his death as a secular celebration of Irish identity and culture. Today, it is celebrated around the world. Savannah, GA and our very own Suffolk County, MA, are the only American municipalities to legally recognize it as a holiday.
Boston’s parade is held annually on the Sunday closest to March 17, and is organized by the Allied War Veterans Council of South Boston as a celebration of the holiday. It promises good clean fun for the whole family: their website specifies that “[we] will not allow the advertisement or display of one’s sexual orientation as a topic that should in any way be depicted as a theme of our parade”—likely in reference to a 2017 controversy over the temporary ban of a BGLTQ military veterans group from the parade. Their Code of Conduct also prohibits political protests and improper language.

A vendor selling parade apparel out of the back of his van holds up a shirt that reads, “Keep Calm and FUCKIN’ GO NUTS,” with the “FUCKIN’ GO NUTS” in perky Dunkin’ Donuts font. Barricades and rope lines are set up along the street. A news chopper dangles in the sky, black against sharp blue, as the first ambulances and fire engines pass. People clap weakly as SWAT armored vans trundle down the street. A policeman walks by, waving around a selfie stick.
Politicians drive by, hands waving outside black Chevy Tahoes and darkened faces inside. A man in a sparkling turquoise suit moonwalks and twirls to the crowd’s delight. Marching bands pass, from college to high school to elementary school troupes. One high school drummer’s chin strap has blown into his face, and he scrunches his eyes to see.
***
Everyone here is very proud of their Irishness, or very proud of the fact that some people are proud of their Irishness, or very proud of our troops, or very drunk. I was curious about what kind of ethnic identity—identity in general—can be found by getting wasted on a Sunday morning, wearing a Celtics jersey and, maybe, buying one of the tiny $5 Irish flags they’re selling by the T stop. Not to say everyone here is like that—there are plenty of families in attendance, plenty of people for whom this is an annual tradition and for whom Ireland is more than a distant green dream. But still.
***
An emerald-green, box-shaped Scion rolls by, plastered with Guinness logos. “SINN FEIN BABY,” a middle-aged man behind me yells. “Up the republic!” says another. Further down the street, I hear, “Irish Christmas! Yes!” A woman holds up a bottle of tequila mix for her friend to chug, while a third films.
An inflated leprechaun, ginger beard and top hat and all, dances on a flatbed trailer to Katy Perry. Another flatbed rolls by, blasting AC-DC. It carries signs with “Stand for the Flag, Kneel for the Cross” emblazoned in faux Gaelic font over American and Irish flags.
OUTVETS, the recently unbarred organization for BGLTQ veterans, marches by. A man teeters by on a unicycle, clutching his green bowler hat. I watch a Times Square cast of characters dance on a trailer: Captain America, Batman, a minion, an Elmo with a misshapen face, a poorly anthropomorphized Pikachu, all convulsing to the beat. Men in Revolutionary War uniforms fire off a musket volley. A bus plastered with ads for Shiva Ayyadurai’s Senate run proclaims, “Only a REAL INDIAN Can Defeat the Fake Indian.” His headshot is next to a poorly edited photo of Elizabeth Warren, a notionally Native American headdress photoshopped onto her head, her face darkened brown-red.
It’s around 3 p.m. by now. Further down the parade route, people are hanging out second-floor windows, toting Solo cups, throwing beers to the crowd below—which is thinning rapidly, and, more strikingly, becoming less green by the block. The die-hard, green body paint crowd has been left behind; relatively normal-looking people, wearing “Kiss Me, I’m Irish” hoodies and Timberlands, are walking the parade route now. It’s all over.
My hands have been frozen for a good 15 minutes now, and I hustle my way back to the T stop. The cleanup has already begun. Boston Public Works employees are out in full force, sweeping away the remnants of this cold Sunday afternoon: beer cans, nip bottles, candy wrappers, plastic plates, Irish flags. It’ll all be back next year.

My grandmother stood shaking in the open doorway. She called out to my mother and her younger sister, warning them to raise their blue canvas backpacks above their heads as they stepped off the school bus and ran across the front yard. She didn’t know what the end of the world looked like, but she must have imagined that it might suddenly rain down from the sky in large, fiery droplets.
Overnight, the local plant had begun to leak radiation after an overwhelming amount of heat and pressure built up in its reactors. It was the result of random mechanical glitches, poor oversight, and human error—I’ll spare you the technicalities. My mother and her classmates were rushed out of their seventh grade Social Studies class as sleepy Middletown, Penn. became the center of the largest nuclear meltdown in United States history.
Less than five miles from Three Mile Island, my mother’s home sat along a path of unknown destruction. No one really knew what was happening—all that people knew about nuclear disasters was the improbability depicted in “The China Syndrome,” a futuristic thriller then creating a stir in theaters earlier that month. Cars packed with young families, my mother’s among them, set off for the mountains.
On any other day, if you stand outside my mother’s childhood home, you can catch the aroma of  milk chocolate from the Hershey factories nearby. On March 28, the air was fresh and the sky clear, but my mother held her breath.
***
I hadn’t given much thought to our upcoming conversation as I scrolled through the news on my phone. I’d only been home a day or so, and knew that my parents had wanted to talk to me. I figured it would be about our upcoming move or another box to sort through before selling the house.
The conversation was about the move, but the three of us would not be making it together. Our small family unit had divided into two and now, I stood somewhere in between. It was the result of deception, poor oversight, and significant human error, but I’ll spare you the technicalities. All of the obvious warning signs had been there, but unknown to me.
I couldn’t understand how the sky remained so blue and the sun so bright on the afternoon that my world unexpectedly crashed down. Unable to react, I sat in shock. I wanted nothing more than to run.

They arrived at a small, somewhat decrepit cabin set deep in the Poconos forest. They would share the wooden house with my grandfather’s new family, including his younger second wife and a son the same age as one belonging to his first. Any awkwardness was assuaged by the prospect of imminent nuclear collapse.
A knock on the door interrupted the endless waiting. On the porch stood a young, friendly couple and their two elementary school-aged daughters. Staying in a cabin next door without power during the evacuation, the family asked to borrow a few candles to light the house that evening.
In the middle of the night, my adolescent mother awoke to the sound of screams. She looked out the window but all she saw was a wall of orange. Instead of large droplets, the end of the world would be signaled by a vivid flash of color.
As her eyes adjusted to the light, she descried the couple living next door. She noticed the wife first because of her nakedness. She clung to her husband, wrapped only in a sheet as she watched her home burn to the ground.

We spent a week in tenth grade Chemistry delving into the mechanics of nuclear reactions. An unstable nucleus divides into smaller parts, emitting energy. These new fragments are no longer the same element, their isotopes irrevocably modified in the process of fission. A single division sets off a chain reaction.
According to my mom, after a week or so, school was back in session. Sure there were conspiracies, but kids quickly moved past discussing the events at Three Mile Island. The nuclear threat hadn’t been from some foreign adversary; it had originated domestically. While clocking in at a five on the seven-point nuclear event scale, meaning it qualified as an “accident with wider consequences,” the meltdown had not killed anyone.
I wonder if this chain reaction ever really stops. Even as the meltdown is contained, trace amounts of radioactive fallout lie dormant, having seeped into the water and soil. It’ll take a lifetime, or multiple, to disappear.
One can’t easily forget watching a home burn to the ground.

More than 40 years after scientists first detonated a nuclear device in the Trinity test, composer and conductor James Yannatos assembled over 350 musicians for an unusual memorial.
In April 1986, 90 members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra premiered “Trinity Mass,” composed by Yannatos. Over 260 vocalists from the Harvard Glee Club, the Radcliffe Choral Society, the Collegium Musicum, and other local choral groups joined them on a packed stage in Sanders Theater.  The large-scale collaboration between student ensembles had a very specific musical story to tell: the human history of the atomic bomb.
With the looming history of World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War, “war was there, in your consciousness, a lot,” says Nyia Yannatos, the composer’s widow.
James Yannatos told Harvard Magazine in 1986 that the composition was “a Mass for beyond war.”  He wanted the music to persuade listeners of the horrors of war, both nuclear and conventional.
Before coming to Harvard, and long before he composed “Trinity Mass,” Yannatos was already using music for social justice.  Earlier in his career, he was active as both a violinist and as an assistant conductor in San Antonio, where he and a bass player founded an interracial chorus.  “Now, we’re talking in the fifties, in Texas,” Nyia notes appreciatively.
His passion for social justice also informed his pacifist politics. “He’s been antiwar ever since he could speak,” she says.  On Memorial Day in 1970, at the height of the Vietnam War, Yannatos organized a concert called Musicians for Peace in Sanders Theater. A massive ensemble performed Brahms’ Requiem, a performance that anticipated his “Trinity Mass.” The mood of that performance was also somber—Yannatos requested the audience refrain from applause in honor of Memorial Day.
Yannatos was music director of the HRO from 1964 until his retirement in 2009.  During the course of those 45 years, “Dr. Y,” as students called him, built the orchestra up from a struggling, incomplete ensemble to a full group that regularly undertook international tours.  At one point, he even turned down an opportunity to become an assistant conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, choosing instead to remain at Harvard.
A former student of J. Nadia Boulanger and Leonard Bernstein ’39, Yannatos was a highly accomplished violinist, conductor, and composer. “Trinity Mass” won the 1988 Artists Foundation Award.
But he was still “a more approachable conductor than [others] I’ve worked with,” says William C. “Bill” Hahn ’87, who played clarinet in the HRO under Dr. Yannatos’ direction throughout college. “He cared deeply about the orchestra and [his] students.”
After performances, the Yannatoses would often invite students over to their home for a listening session so they could hear their work. “He loved being with students and having music be an important part of their lives,” Nyia says.
The Trinity Mass piece was important to Yannatos. Nyia preserved the program notes, printed on thick paper in red and black ink. Yannatos writes in the program that “Trinity Mass” sketches out a meditation on the history of the atomic bomb, treating time “cubistically.”
Some of the events swirled into the score include the detonation of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and the Atomic Energy Commission’s inquiry into J. Robert Oppenheimer ’25 during the McCarthy era. Oppenheimer was investigated for his reluctance to support early development of the hydrogen bomb.
The libretto draws from 33 sources, ranging from the Bible to J. Robert Oppenheimer and Winston Churchill to voices as diverse as Native American leaders, Hiroshima survivors, children, and the King of Heracleopolis (circa 1990 BCE).
“Well, he certainly did a lot of reading to find the quotes that he wanted,” Nyia says, laughing. After a long period of research, Yannatos compiled the libretto in three days during the summer of 1984.
The title is only a religious reference in an indirect sense. Oppenheimer chose the codename “Trinity” for the first test of the atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. He drew inspiration from John Donne’s Sonnet 14, which begins: “Batter my heart, three-personed God.”
In the face of this brutal conception of God, the first movement concludes: “Christe, eleison. Christ, have mercy on us.”
Over the course of 75 minutes, the hundreds of musicians crammed on the stage carry the listener from ethereally dissonant instrumentals to shining, full choral passages.
The day after the premiere in Sanders, the entire ensemble took buses to New York City to perform the mass again at the world’s largest cathedral, St. John the Divine. As the Yannatoses prepared to enter the vast cathedral, Nyia recalls that they “were both a little anxious, [wondering] will people come?” But the piece proved to be a powerful draw for the audience. “We walked in, and the place was just packed.”
In the views of both the critics and the composer, the performance was a success.  According to the program notes, the New York Times noted that “one cannot help feeling strongly” about the nuclear imagery, and the Boston Globe dubbed it “a cerebral feast of words and music.”
“It was wonderful having so many groups come together,” Nyia says. “I remember my husband feeling enormous gratitude that it did come off the way it did, and that his vision was played so beautifully.”
By the end of the 1986 performance at St. John the Divine, Nyia “truly felt people were moved.” She recalls that, as the audience filed out of the cathedral, “we all walked out feeling, yes, [change] could be possible—wouldn’t it be so beautiful?”
Still, she says, “if he were alive now, I think he would be so, so horrified” that there are  “generations of young people who now have only grown up knowing war.” Her voice is raw.
Nyia says her husband would nonetheless continue to have faith in the possibility the world could change, and that people fundamentally want peace. In the mass, after all of the horror that the music illustrates, Yannatos pulls the listener into a sweeping, hopeful ending: “I dream of that day when my child will say: ‘Mother, what was war?’”

“A cosmic phenomena like an eclipse.”
Maybe there would be no atomic bomb. That, at least, was the hope of James Bryant Conant, 23rd president of Harvard, as he set out to write an informal secret history of the bomb in 1943. That document, “A History of the Development of an Atomic Bomb,” was never published. Declassified in 1960, a copy exists on microfilm in the basement of Lamont Library.
“Everyone concerned with the project would feel greatly relieved and thoroughly delighted if something would develop to prove the impossibility of such an atomic explosive,” Conant, a former assistant managing editor of The Crimson, wrote.
In the early years of the Second World War, Conant chaired the S-1 Executive Committee, the branch of the Office of Scientific Research and Development tasked with overseeing nuclear weapons research. After S-1 transferred its jurisdiction to the Army, and focus shifted from research to development, Conant became a scientific advisor to the Manhattan Project and a member of the Military Policy Committee. Besides overseeing progress, Conant was responsible for recruiting top scientific talent to the burgeoning Project, whose cardinal aim was to produce an atomic bomb. One of the scientists he brought in was J. Robert Oppenheimer ’26.
But by the time Conant—a member of the class of 1914—started writing his informal history, he had vacillated between skepticism, dread, and conviction for years.
Conant’s first consideration was the War. He was an ardent nationalist and a hawk. His vision of the future involved the United States “armed to the teeth, belligerent and running the world,” as he wrote in his diary in June 1940. He had been an advocate for U.S. intervention in the Second World War at a time when isolationism was still the reigning precept guiding the American public. In a speech to Harvard students in the fall of 1940, Conant argued “war is not the worst possibility we face; the worst is the complete triumph of totalitarianism.”
The possibility of nuclear weapons, and the possibility that Germany would achieve them before the United States, exacerbated Conant’s anxiety about the war. Conant did not initially want an atomic bomb, and he doubted scientists could make one. But if there had to be one, he felt that the U.S. should get there first.
“The enormity of the light quite stunned me.”
Conant was also worried about what the success or failure of the Manhattan Project would augur for higher education. Conant’s vision of the postwar American golden age was a meritocratic one, with higher education at its core. What Conant realized was that his and his colleagues’ entrenchment in the project tied their fates directly to the bomb. Physicist Arthur Compton later wrote that “[a]s president of Harvard University, [Conant’s] word was representative of American scientific scholarship. To guess wrong could mean incalculable damage to the nation’s respect for its men of learning.”
Conant’s worry was not unfounded, but, ironically, he spent little of his time actually governing his institution of higher learning, Harvard. 
 Conant’s commitment to S-1 was considerable. According to his biographer James G. Hershberg ’82, Conant spent as many as five days a week in Washington. This led to dissatisfied whisperings of a plot—ultimately abandoned—to  replace Conant among members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
In May 1945, as the completion of the atomic bomb drew closer, Conant was appointed to the Interim Committee, created to advise President Harry S. Truman on how to use the impending weapon. He had grown increasingly worried about a postwar arms race. He thought that nothing short of actual military use could deter countries from unleashing the bomb’s monstrous capabilities.
“The ball of gas was enlarging rapidly and turning into a mushroom!”
Conant therefore advised Truman to drop the atomic bomb immediately, and on a heavily populated area. His opinion was etched into history in the minutes for the Interim Committee’s May 31st meeting: “At the suggestion of Dr. Conant the Secretary agreed that the most desirable target would be a vital war plant employing a large number of workers and closely surrounded by workers’ houses.”
All speculation evaporated, however, on July 16, 1945, when the Army conducted the first detonation of a nuclear weapon in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Conant flew into Alamogordo, the testing site, the night before, anxious to see what fruits the past four years would bear.
Around 5 a.m., Conant stationed himself 10 miles from the detonation. Against advice, he kept his eyes open, without protective glasses, as a loudspeaker counted down the taut seconds to the end.
It took a whole day for Conant to put pen to paper to describe what he’d seen at Alamogordo.
“The whole sky suddenly full of white light like the end of the world.”
For 70 years, the light a Harvard president helped ignite has continued to burn. Entire movements have sprung to extinguish it, as have generations of academics; neither have succeeded. These days, news broadcasts about potential nuclear threats from North Korea are frequent, but they do not dominate campus dialogue. This was not always the case.
 
The first edition of “The Tocsin” cost five cents, and a yellowing copy of the publication sits in the Harvard University Archives, held together with a worn-out staple.  The top of the first page has a citation from “The Encyclopedia Americana”: “Etymology of Tocsin: A bell sounded with quick strokes for the purpose of alarm. Its use as a signal to arouse the people during the French Revolution of 1789 was so common that the word has since come to signify any loud sound or call marking the commencement of an important event.”
Barbara R. Du Bois ’62 remembers reading a book on atrocities in Nazi Germany when she was nine or ten and asking her mother how such things could happen. “They shouldn't,” the young Du Bois’s mother replied, “but they do.”
 A decade later, when Du Bois was starting her junior year at Radcliffe College, her mother’s words lingered. She became one of the founding members of “Tocsin,” a group formed to advocate for nuclear disarmament at Harvard and the Harvard women’s college, Radcliffe.
The generation that entered college in the 1960s grew up in the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Drop and cover drills in school and fallout shelters stocked with rations were part and parcel of daily life. Walking home one day, the thought hit her: “The bomb is not abstract,” Du Bois remembers thinking. “This bomb could drop right here.”
Du Bois, a self-described “practitioner of the Buddhadharma,” phones from “semi-retreat” in Arizona. Her short-term memory is hazy, she says, but her memories of this era are clear.
“What I was aware of was the unbelievable apathy that existed throughout our country and throughout every group and circle I was connected with,” Du Bois says. “Nobody but nobody was thinking about this issue with a sense of moral responsibility. They were thinking about it with a sense of outrage and hopelessness.”
“There were a couple of looming issues that just stood above all others,” recalls Peter C. Goldmark Jr. ’62, another early member of Tocsin. 
 “By far the biggest was the danger of blowing ourselves and everyone else up. The nuclear issue—it was just sitting out there, and what was striking was it was relatively unaddressed.”
There were other college student groups in the country who also focused on nuclear issues at the time. One of the most prominent was the National Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy, or SANE, which had a Harvard-Radcliffe chapter that recorded 70 members in the spring of 1960—including some Tocsin founders.
But Tocsin differentiated itself, according to Goldmark, by concentrating on specific policy concerns. “We were issue-focused, not ideology-focused. We were willing to weigh in to discuss the issues and I think by and large a community like Harvard respected that,” he says.
And they were aware of the clout they could wield as a Harvard-centered group.
“To affect the climate of opinion at Harvard on nuclear arms would be to affect the climate of opinion throughout the country,” Du Bois says. “People whom we studied with and whom we knew personally by then did have the ear of Washington. We focused where we could be skilled and confident about what we were saying and why and how we were speaking, and where we would have access to people who would hear us and who could act.”
Tocsin started small but grew fast. Du Bois remembers sitting on a living room floor creating a poster to attract students at the beginning of the year. A few weeks later The Crimson reported that about 150 people came out for the first Tocsin meeting, held in Quincy House in Oct. 1960.
Todd A. Gitlin ’63 was among those new members in Tocsin’s early months. He says he had no prior protest experience. 
 That October, he stood in the middle of Quincy dining hall wearing an anti-nuke button. Robert E. Weil ’61, the first chairman of Tocsin, approached him, he remembers; after that, he was quickly swept into the group.
Gitlin says he appreciated Tocsin’s down-to-earth approach. “For one thing it was pragmatic, for another thing, it wasn't dogmatic, for a third thing, it stressed local initiatives,” Gitlin recalls. He saw the leadership as “passionate, but not hysterical, engaged, but not strident, and serious.” As seemingly the entire world grew tense over nuclear proliferation, Gitlin saw Tocsin as a level-headed bedrock in the debate.
During that first October meeting, Tocsin leaders distributed sheets with two dozen specific proposed student actions. Nov. 10, 1960 saw the release of the first issue of a Tocsin publication known simply as “The Tocsin.” Less than a month later, Tocsin organized a “walk” on campus. According to “The Sixties,” a book Gitlin wrote years later reflecting on the era, about 1,000 people donned the blue arm bands Tocsin members handed out during the protest.
Others were less supportive. Du Bois particularly remembers a woman shaking her fist and yelling, “You people shouldn’t be allowed to do this. This is a democracy!”
“That was fabulous!” Du Bois laughs, over five decades later. “I loved that.”

Tocsin’s big moment, though, came in Feb. 1962, when its members marched on Washington.
The Crimson reported that 2,000 students were expected to come from across the country, of which of which 300 were expected to be from Harvard and Radcliffe. Goldmark was now the Tocsin chairman, Gitlin was vice chairman, and the group was helping organize “Project Washington,” a February march for nuclear disarmament.
Two weeks earlier, The Crimson reported that the FBI had declared the demonstration “clear” of communist influence.
In preparation for Project Washington, Tocsin members watched a film of a protest march in England. They also hosted seminar sessions to educate themselves on disarmament issues and wrote policy papers and proposals. Not only would Tocsin members be marching, but some would also talk to members of the Kennedy administration about disarmament, in particular arguing for the U.S.to announce a ban on atmospheric testing. If the U.S. stopped atmospheric testing, Tocsin reasoned, other nations would follow.
The students needed to make sure their positions were focused and solid. Hans J. Morgentheau, then a professor of Political Science at University of Chicago who had served as a visiting professor in Government from 1960-61, analyzed the situation in a Jan. 1962 Crimson interview. Tocsin “must present their case seriously," he said, "or people in Washington will dismiss it as an adolescent prank."
Christopher A. Sims ’63, a Tocsin member, remembers the march preparation as stressful but exciting. 
 “We were not getting much sleep and we were working steadily and things were happening one after another,” he says.
“We knew we were on the edge of unchartered territory,” Goldmark says, recalling the energy of the moment. “When was the last time a group of Harvard students had demonstrated outside the White House?”
Buses left from in front of Claverly Hall at 9 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 15 and Friday, Feb. 16. Du Bois laughs as she recalls the transportation. “This was the 1960s and we were kids. You know it wasn’t a comfortable bus.”
It had also been snowing on and off the whole week. Gitlin decided to drive down to D.C., but the snow forced him to abandon his car in Springfield, MA and take the train the rest of the way. But a little snow was a small price to pay.
No one seems to know definitively how many people were at the march. The New York Times reported police estimates of 2,800; a Crimson article written over a year later cites the number as 6,000; Gitlin recalls trying to count and coming up with “maybe 8,000 people.” It’s a big range.
The first images that come to most people’s minds when they hear of a ’60s protest are guitar players and flower children. But for Tocsin, looking serious was the first step to serious action. Marchers were encouraged to dress in regular suits and to wear ties according to a Feb. 18, 1962 New York Times article. Were it not for the protest signs, the article states, the well-dressed marchers “might have been queuing up to see a late-in-the-season football game at Harvard Stadium.”
Gitlin numbered among the students who met with officials in Washington. He says the group earned a positive reception from the administration of John F. Kennedy ’40, a former Crimson Business Manager. 
“We met with a lot of officials in the administration and members of Congress,” Gitlin says. “Some of us met in the White House with several of Kennedy's top people and they were without commitment. They were friendly.”
After Feb. 17, the two-day protest and discussion that had been months in the making drew to a close. Buses hit the road, first-time protesters parted, and members of Tocsin returned to Cambridge, waiting to see what would come out of Washington.
Peter Goldmark saw the march as a success. He feels many people saw it as “a wake up call to the country as a whole,” who could see that college students—the next generation—really cared about nuclear weapons proliferation.
“I was told by some staffers of the White House,” Goldmark says, “that it really increased attention in the White House. Not only to the elements of their policy but where the politics of this issue were likely to go in the future.”
In August 1963, the U.S. signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty banning all above-ground tests of nuclear weapons—a primary Tocsin demand from Project Washington.
But time is valuable in college. As 1963 became 1964 became 1965, the civil rights movement and the Vietnam war protests gained traction. Founding members graduated, and the energy that might have gone toward more disarmament protests went elsewhere. Tocsin stuck around, popping up every now and then in The Crimson but never again achieving the momentum and notoriety surrounding Project Washington.
Nuclear proliferation ceased to be the hot topic of the day, but this didn’t mean Harvard students sunk back into the apathy that Barbara Du Bois saw in the ’50s. The opposite took place: students were sparked. The movements of the present built on the movements of the past as if campus activism were traced on a palimpsest—writing, erasing and rewriting over and over on the same template.
If you search the Student Organization List on the Office of Student Life website for words like “nuclear,” “atomic,” and “disarmament,” nothing comes up. There are no student groups at Harvard now that do the same work Tocsin did—no students organizing disarmament protests with the same fervor that Du Bois, Goldmark, Gitlin, and other Tocsinites shared. And while marches in Washington are far from a thing of the past these days, they aren’t typically focused on the current global stockpile of approximately 15,000 nuclear weapons.
The current nuclear threat, for many, is North Korea. Roughly a half dozen Harvard students with ties to South Korea said they feel equal parts frustration with and resignation over the looming danger. Friction with North Korea is nothing new to these students—nor are North Korea’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
On Sept. 3, 2017, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb compact enough to load onto a warhead. Two months later, North Korea launched the Hwasong-15, a ballistic missile capable in theory of reaching the continental United States. With these two milestones, the pall of annihilation crept up again.
Jonathan Suh ’20 moved to Illinois in 2006 after his mother, a pastor, was invited to serve in a local church. But more than half of his family still lives in South Korea, mostly in Seoul, just 35 miles from the North Korean border. Suh thinks about that. “If there ever was an attack—God forbid not, but...” he pauses. “They all live in Seoul. I mean, that’s the place they’re going to attack, right?”
Even though he’s lived in the U.S. for most of his life, Suh says he still feels attached South Korea. He gets up early to watch the South Korean National Soccer team. “I have to wake up sometimes at 4:30, 5 a.m., but I watch those games,” he says. “You can ask my roommate.”
So he doesn’t like it when people make jokes about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I feel uncomfortable doing that,” he says. “It’s a real threat to people that I really care about.”
Jokes about the North Korean nuclear crisis also exasperate Kate Yoon ’18. Yoon attended high school in South Korea, though she also grew up in Canada.
“My predominant feeling at Harvard is not even apathy or fear, but frustration at the way people think of tensions as funny,” she says. She too cites Kim Jong Un jokes as examples of this. “Basically people think he’s throwing tantrums, or they think it’s something funny, or they don’t really understand what’s going on, but they’re like ‘North Korea just wants to bomb everybody.’”
Daniel Kim ’21 has lived in South Korea for most of his life. When he came to the U.S. for college, though, he had to prepare for the unthinkable. His parents gave him a special debit card and told him to use it in case they die in “the war.”
“No one really thinks that’s going to happen imminently,” he says, “but it’s still on their minds.”
Kim doesn’t talk much with people about the North Korean threat. It’s extreme, but catastrophe to him feels too improbable. “I feel like it’s better for us in terms of mental health if we just live as normal and try not to worry about it,” he says.
Like all South Korean citizens, Kim will have to serve in the military. He plans to do his service after college. He sometimes wonders, “What if I’m in the military and the war breaks out? Of course they’ll use us,” he says. “Which is kind of a scary thought.”
Distance—in part—complicates the entire business. Joon Yang ’17-19 returned from his compulsory military service last semester. He was stationed in a tank unit less than twenty miles south of the North Korean border. When he first arrived, he realized that all of the tanks faced north, and as the days went by, military service inured Yang to the constant tension. It became “part of the mundane.”
Relentless proximity to North Korea made Yang realize that the crisis was “a lot bigger than what we make it out to be,” which is part of the reason he’s doubtful about the efficacy of casual college conversations.
“That doesn’t mean we should just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show,” he says. “Lack of proper understanding and knowledge, that we can cure. But coming up with a solution is a totally different question.”
Yang also recognizes that, for most Harvard students, “at the end of the day, it’s an important issue, but it’s not an urgent issue for them.” There are predictable, and understandable, reasons for this general indifference, he says: grades, recruiting, careers. Not much time to protest atomic annihilation. “It’s unrealistic,” he says.
Elaine Scarry, a Harvard English professor, says she thinks the sense of apathy might be societal, rather than generational. She says it’s a problem that confounds experts who work in nuclear policy.
Scarry chaired a conference at Harvard in November on nuclear policy, and recently published a book calling for the categorical elimination of nuclear weapons.
“Of course there are a lot of people in the United States who care about the the problem of nuclear weapons, but it’s just that it’s oddly, oddly absent from the public discourse,” Scarry says. “Often it’s particularly young people, students, but actually it’s across an age range.”
Scarry says the apathy is particularly odd, given that there are “1,000 topics that would lead you to predict that people would care a lot about this issue.” She lists off imperialism, racism, and the environment. “If you had to predict who would care about this, everybody would care about this, but the answer is that very few people care about it,” she says.
“It’s not that people don’t protest in general, or take responsibility in general,” Scarry says. But she believes people feel powerless when it comes to war. Nuclear weapons, she asserts, are a “heightened form” of war.
This complicates traditional notions of activism. “The nuclear is a heightened form of [war-specific apathy] because it’s the most dire, and there’s the least time to act on a protest,” Scarry says. In a conventional war, for example, protests can be held every day until the war ends. With nuclear weapons, however, there is no such interim between a launch and a devastation.
This isn’t to say Scarry disapproves of protest, or speaking up about nuclear proliferation. She thinks that “the only time to protest is now” because “the only injuries you can prevent are the ones that haven’t happened.”
Graham T. Allison ’62, a professor at the Kennedy School, agrees with Scarry about student apathy. Though he would like students and the public to have a “heightened consciousness” of these sorts of issues, he says he recognizes that “people most of the time don’t spend their time worrying about distant and complicated issues. They get on with their lives.”
Allison is a former dean of the Kennedy School of Government and former assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. During the 1980s, he proposed a model for controlled deterrence of nuclear war known as the “Owl” strategy. More recently, in 2004, he published a book on nuclear terrorism.
He says he thinks there is a high chance that 2018 will see either a North Korean attack on the West Coast or a preemptive American attack on North Korea.
“The security community gets it. Trump gets it. But if you’re asking your classmates or you walk in the square and try to see who you could find who would be interested in this, there wouldn't be much interest,” he says.
Allison is a former director of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a think tank that he says emerged in the early ’70s from Cold War concerns about arms control. Today, the Belfer Center holds a strong reputation for its nuclear weapons policy research.
“I think it’s generally recognized in Washington or the think tank world that if you say ‘Who does nuclear weapons and their consequences and their policy with respect to them?’ They would say the Belfer Center,” Allison says.

The Korea Working Group is the division of the Belfer Center focusing on the current North Korean nuclear crisis. John Park is its director, and his focus is teaching practical policy.
In an undergraduate course he teaches, “Gov 94KA: Thinking Out of the Black Box - Exploring New Insights into North Korea,” Park says he focuses on applications of knowledge. He tries to give students frameworks of analysis that can form part of “a portable toolkit.”
At the end of the day, action and experience are key for Park. He says he feels future changemakers in nuclear armament diplomacy will need more than just pedigree or training; they will need to be passionate, draw from a variety of methodologies, and build their own communities of partners. While taking the time to gain traditional expertise is helpful, in his view, “these issues are moving too quickly.”


It all happens very quickly. And very slowly. Decades, years, months. Or just a few minutes.
“Chloe, get up, go to the bathroom and get in the car, there’s a nuclear missile headed to Hawaii.”
Chloe A. Saracco ’21 says she heard her mom’s voice but didn’t immediately get up. She lay in bed for a few more moments.
“What, mom?” she remembers saying.
“Come on, let’s go!” her mother shouted. “Hurry up!”
She got out of bed.
Downstairs, she says, her dad was carrying two jugs of water and a basket of granola bars on his way to the car while Saracco looked around the kitchen and grabbed a family picture off of the countertop and went to the car with her family photo and her mom and her dad and her dog, Ella.
The Saraccos have a Tesla with a “nuclear button,” she says, that is supposed to recirculate the air so no outside air gets in, a safeguard against radioactive airborne material. But as they were Googling what to do in the moment, they found an online article that said you should not be on the road in the event of a nuclear crisis. So the Saraccos sat in their car in the garage in Hawaii waiting for the incoming missile.
Anna I. Uhr ’19 didn’t set an alarm over winter break, but she woke up on Jan. 13, 2018 to a “loud, scary” noise coming from her phone. She looked at it and saw an alert that a missile was heading toward Hawaii. It was not a drill.
As a memory, she says, the whole incident is different. “Looking back, it all happened so fast and slow at the same time,” Uhr says. “I think my mind just kind of went blank for a long time because I didn’t want to come to realize that this could possibly be the end.”
Her family didn’t know where to find shelter, so they closed their windows, filled up reusable water bottles at the sink, and collected all of their canned food. They didn’t really know what to do; they were doing everything they could think of. But a lot of it felt pointless.
And then it was over. The alert was sent in error. It wasn’t until 8:45 a.m., though, that another message went out over cell phones retracting the the warning. Thirty-eight minutes after the original alert.
Turn off the nuke button on the Tesla. Open the windows. Sit on the couch.
Saracco spent the rest of the day with her family. “We were like, ‘No, we didn't die today, we’re still here together,’” she says. “You know, it gives you a second to catch your breath.”
“My mom hugged us all,” Uhr says. “I think that was just a day I’ll always remember as like…” she pauses. “You never think that your life would end because of a missile crisis over winter break.”
Almost two months later, talking to Saracco and Uhr, the whole incident has taken on a bizarre levity. “There’s so many memes about it,” Uhr says. “It’s very much a joke now, but I think kind of a cruel joke.”
The incident also retains a lasting gravity.
“I started texting my parents goodnight every night,” Saracco says. She takes a moment to gather herself as she sits in a campus cafe. A tear falls from her eye. She wipes it, and she moves on.
Saracco and Uhr are back on the mainland, in the middle of spring semester at Harvard. Still supposedly in range of a North Korean missile, but it’s more of a distant threat. Saracco says her family now keeps duffel bags packed. “You’re supposed to have clothes to change into so you can get the ones with radioactive material off,” she says.

Conant never regretted advising Truman to drop the bomb. He held to the line that military example was needed to show people the full import of the weapon.
And yet the demonstration of the bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki had the opposite of the preventative effect Conant wanted—it kicked off the Cold War arms race. It birthed the spectre that would haunt the Tocsinites as they marched in Washington in 1962; the spectre that would flicker for a moment in Hawaii in 2018; the spectre that today hangs over the Koreas, students at Harvard, and the world.
The spectre came to haunt Conant too, in the end. When he learned of the next iteration of atomic weaponry, the hydrogen bomb, he was horrified. Here was a weapon that promised explosive power up to 1,000 times greater than the bomb he saw at Alamogordo. Conant became an unsuccessful advocate for nonproliferation, then disarmament.
By then, hydrogen bombs had already proliferated across the globe.
Conant was living through the reverberations of that day in 1945 when he witnessed the first test of a bomb he helped make. He was inhabiting the world of his sketches and notes taken from 10 miles away. Those reverberations have yet to stop.
“My story starts with the report of a Committee of the National Academy dated May 17, 1941,” Conant wrote in 1943 as the Manhattan Project took off. The report said that an atomic bomb was possible. “When and where it will end no one can now foresee.”

Though both the capital campaign and Michael D. Smith’s tenure as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are set to conclude in the near future, Smith said FAS will continue fundraising for key projects.
The University’s capital campaign, launched in 2013, has long since surpassed its goal of $6.5 billion and has now raised over $8 billion. FAS passed its individual $2.5 billion goal in 2016, though certain areas of the campaign still have not met their fundraising goals. In an interview earlier this month, Smith said he will make one last push to raise money for these areas—which include FAS financial aid—before the campaign ends in June.
“We've got a key push here at the end,” Smith said, adding FAS must “make sure financial aid continues to have the strength that it needs to continue that program in the future.”
The undergraduate House renewal project has also lagged behind in meeting its fundraising goals. Four Houses have undergone renovations as part of the more than $1 billion ongoing project. Construction is underway at Lowell House, and Adams House, Eliot House, and Kirkland House are set to see renovations as part of Phase I of the project, according to Smith. Smith has previously said Phase II will likely involve minor renovations to Mather and the Quad Houses.
“I'm still raising money for house renewal. That's a project that's going to outlive the end of the campaign,” Smith said. “So we'll continue to talk to our alumni and friends about financial support and that project in the future.”
Funding the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences remains another aspect of the capital campaign yet unfinished. The new Allston complex—slated to eventually house SEAS—is set to open on schedule in 2020.
While much of SEAS is moving across the river, Smith also said future opportunities will remain available in the void left on Oxford Street, where current SEAS and sciences buildings like Pierce and Maxwell-Dworkin currently stand.
“We have an opportunity to reorganize some of our faculty and some of the research that's going on there and be able to generate some new facilities for teaching purposes with the space that’s opened up,” Smith said. “So conversations about that and talking to our alumni about the potential there and what the future holds.”
Despite shortfalls in certain areas, Smith said the campaign has been “really successful,” especially in helping donors understand FAS’s financial priorities across the next few years.
“That's always an important aspect of any campaign—to think about what the institution should be doing next and making the arguments about why that is and trying to get support for it. The alumni have been absolutely fantastic,” he said.
Smith said the end of the capital campaign will set new goals for future campaigns.
“We will continue to fundraise,” Smith said. “Part of the goal of the campaign is not only to give focus on the new aspirations that you have, but set a new target for annual fundraising as we move forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent spate of mumps outbreaks across the country, including one at Harvard, may be due to the waning effectiveness of the mumps vaccine, according to a new study published by two researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Yonatan Grad, assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases, joined Joseph Lewnard, a postdoctoral research fellow who is the study’s lead author, to publish their research in “Science Translational Medicine" this week.
The pair brought together data from six different research studies to draw their conclusions. In an interview Wednesday, Grad pointed to the 2016 mumps outbreak at Harvard—which affected more than 40 students—as an inspiration for the analysis.
“It was actually the Harvard outbreak that first caught my attention and then got me interested in explaining the question of why we’re seeing a resurgence of mumps in highly vaccinated populations,” he said.
Cases of mumps have been on the rise nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In 2017, more than 5,000 people contracted the disease, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2012. College campuses have been hit particularly hard, which experts have previously attributed to the close contact between students.
Grad said he wanted to discover whether the increase in mumps cases was due to a new strain of mumps resistant to the vaccine—or due to the vaccine’s effectiveness wearing off as patients aged. Currently, federal recommendations call for two vaccinations: one between 12 and 15 months of age, and a second between four and six years.
“In our analysis, we saw that waning was consistent with what we were observing, whereas the appearance of a new strain that escaped the vaccine was not,” he said.
Lewnard added the concentration of recent mumps cases in young adults, who have not received vaccinations in years, suggests a decline over time in the vaccine’s preventative capacity.
“Without waning of protection, there’s not much reason why a strain should be focused in older age groups like young adults,” he said.
Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira oversaw the University’s response to Harvard’s outbreak two years ago. During the outbreak, University Health Services placed almost a dozen students in isolation to prevent the spread of the disease.
Barreira said he worked with the authors of the study to compare the cost-effectiveness of isolating infected students versus vaccinating healthy students in order to manage mumps outbreaks.
While Barreira said declining vaccine immunity forms “the best explanation” for the Harvard outbreak, he also mentioned the vaccine is not 100 percent effective.
“Even if the vaccination was maximally protective, there would still be a 15 percent or so rate of developing the infection,” he said.
In the research paper, the authors suggest a third vaccination around age 18 as a possible means to reduce cases of mumps. The scientists are not the first to consider this idea: In light of recent research, the CDC recommended a third dose for at-risk populations in a January report.
Still, official recommendations do not call for all people to be routinely vaccinated at 18, which the authors say “should be assessed in clinical trials.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joseph C. Bartley, the founder of the iconic hamburger restaurant “Mr. Bartley’s Gourmet Burgers” in Harvard Square, died on March 5. He was 87 years old.
A Depression Era baby who grew up in North Andover, Bartley left school in ninth grade to support his family. He worked at a mill until he couldn’t stand it anymore, according to Bartley’s son Bill, who currently manages the restaurant. Eventually, Bartley got into the restaurant business, operating a pharmacy food counter in Long Island.
“We always say he started life from way behind the goalpost and made it past the other end with not a lot of help besides my mother,” Bill Bartley said.
In 1960, after getting together $10,000 in tip money and loans, Bartley and his wife Joan moved to Cambridge and took over the Harvard Spa convenience store on one end of Harvard Square. Bartley's Burgers—now a Harvard Square fixture and huge tourist attraction—started as a small grill that sold greeting cards and paper goods and made most of its money off newspaper sales.
Bill recalled that, when he asked his mother about their retirement plans, she said she and Bartley never imagined they would be able to retire.
“He had everything riding on it, he had five kids all together. Failure’s not an option now and it wasn’t an option then,” Bill said. “I can’t imagine what he would have done if he had been highly educated."
"There’s nothing my dad couldn’t do,” he added.
The concept of a gourmet burger restaurant was a novelty at the time, Bill said, but Bartley’s business savvy allowed the restaurant to endure for almost sixty years and to enliven an ever-changing Harvard Square. After all, “Colonel Sanders moved on to other spaces,” Bill Bartley joked, while Bartley stuck to his spot despite offers to expand into pricier real estate.
Bill Bartley said he grew up in his father’s restaurant—sometimes quite literally, his crib rocking in the back of the store. “The restaurant is a part of my family and is one of the family members my dad created,” he said.
Paul Lee, the current manager of The Hong Kong Restaurant, grew up alongside Bill Bartley as both men's fathers worked long hours at the Hong Kong and Bartley’s Burgers. Lee recalled playing catch with a tennis ball with Bartley as a kid, running over to order a hamburger for his father, and stopping by for a chat as Bartley took orders outside on warm days in later years. Once, the two restaurants shared a fridge when one of the establishments' appliances broke down.
“I’d consider him the mayor of Harvard Square,” Lee said of Bartley. “He was a character. He always had a good story for you.”
To wring success out of a fast-paced, swiftly changing business, Bartley matched hard work and perseverance with a sense of humor and one-liners like “Hot food hot,” “You can’t sell from an empty cart,” and “They eat with their eyes.” Bill recalled how his father decorated the restaurant with bumper stickers, a poster of beer cans titled “What I really learned in school,” and what he called a “cheesy” corner of Elvis memorabilia.
When his staff was feeling down, Bartley might appear with a mop on his head as a wig, Bill said. If someone didn’t show up for work, the next day he might say, “You know you should never miss work. That’s so I realize how little you do when you’re not here.”
“I started in this business because I just wanted to be with him,” Bill said. “He was that dynamic a character.”
Bartley was “a simple guy,” Bill Bartley, and rubbed elbows with everyday people just as easily as he did with celebrities like Shaquille O’Neal, Jackie Onassis, Katie Couric, and the array of politicians, sports hotshots, and academics who flocked to the restaurant to talk to “Mr. B.” Bartley loved to listen, ask questions, and chat about baseball.
Christos Soillis, the owner of nearby Felix Shoe Repair, remembered how Bartley extended friendship and kindness to him when he was a poor and hungry immigrant just getting started in the shoe repair business.
“I am lucky to be in this country, but I don’t forget yesterday. Never,” Soillis said. “There is no replacement for people like Mr. Bartley.”
Sollis recalled how Bartley sometimes let it slide when he couldn’t quite afford a hamburger. He said Bartley gave him advice on navigating the English language, on the economy of the Square, and on customer service.
“If you have somebody you trust, you find is honest, don’t lose it,” Soillis said. “You do the best you can, you do as much as you can to keep it.”
A devout Catholic, Bartley attended mass every day, insisted on closing on Sundays, and stubbornly served up Lent specials even when they didn’t sell very well.
Away from the bustle and ringing phones of the job, Bartley led a much quieter life in his rare time off from his “Mr. B” persona. He worked on menu ideas, treated his family to seafood on Sundays, or took walks through the streets of Cambridge and Boston or at his beach cottage in Seabrook, N.H.
He had “just a giant heart and he loved to laugh,” Bill said.
Beyond just concocting burgers, Bartley was “the best cook I’ve ever met,” Bill said. Bartley's corn chowder was unparalleled, his son said, though it was eventually replaced by clam chowder on the menu due to tourist demands.
Bartley made a legacy out of naming different burgers at his restaurant after politicians and prominent figures. His son carries on the tradition, with burgers currently on the menu sporting monikers like the “Siriously delicious” iPhone to the “way right and way wrong” Mike Pence burger, though Bill said his father disagreed with some of the more biting names.
For all the elaborate burgers he designed, Bartley’s favorite was just a bun and a medium-rare patty–but it better be done right, Bill said.
“It’s going to be quite an adjustment, but with his faith I’m sure he is in a good place,” Bill said. “And he’ll be criticizing what we’re doing on a daily basis, I’m sure.”
Bartley is survived by his wife Joan and their five children, Kathryn, Joseph Jr., Bill, Robert, and Christopher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students in a Harvard archaeology class are developing a virtual and augmented reality app that will allow users to walk through Harvard Yard and use their phones to look past the dirt surface to see artifacts excavated and found underneath.
Enrollees in Anthropology 1130: “Archaeology of Harvard Yard" are creating the app. These students also dug up and excavated the items rendered visible by the technology.
The teaching staff of the class, which digs up portions of Harvard Yard looking for remnants of old buildings that previously occupied the space, teamed up with Jeff P. Emanuel, Harvard's associate director of academic technology, in fall 2017 to begin developing the app.
Emanuel, an archaeologist himself, co-founded the Digital Scholarship Support Group, an interdisciplinary initiative between Academic Technology, the History Department, the Harvard Library, and the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science.
Director of Academic Partnerships and Peabody Museum Curator Diana D. Loren, who co-teaches the class, said the excavation site centers on the sites of the Old College and Indian College, which were both built in the late 1600s but have since been torn down.
Loren said she is excited about the app because of its ability to make artifacts—which so far include pottery pieces, glass, and tobacco pipes—more accessible to the public.  The app will also allow the class to keep a digital record of pieces enrollees recover.
“It can really reach a greater public, and the story of early Harvard and how Harvard developed [and] the lives of those students really become more available to the public at large,” Loren said. “I think that’s pretty exciting.”
Emanuel and his team accumulated photogrammeric and geospatial data taken by the course’s digital teaching fellow Alexis L. Hartford. The team also brought on Cambridge-based startup Archimedes Digital to drive forward the development of the app.
“Field archaeology has always been about ingesting massive quantities of data, and in recent years, Augmented and Virtual Reality have become more prevalent as means of displaying sites and artifacts to the general public,” Emanuel wrote in an email.
According to Hartford, who did similar digital work on a project in Mexico, the app will allow users to visualize the 3-D models of excavation sites while also referencing student-written “object biographies” about the artifacts obtained through excavation.
“The students did a really good job in connecting those to the bigger picture issues that we’re looking at studying,” Hartford said. “I think that’s really what is making this app work.”
Charles K. Michael ’20, a former Crimson photographer who took Anthropology 1130 last year, said, though he’s excited about the app, he sees it as a “supplement”—and not a replacement—for the hands-on learning experience of excavation.
“The information is presented really well, but the app, or technology, can never replace the actual experience of digging,” Michael said.
Michael’s own excavation work in the class included finding the remnants of an ink bottle from he later identified as hailing from Carter’s Ink Company, which dates back to the 1800s.
“You can scroll layer by layer as you’re sifting through the dirt virtually in the app and see the different types of objects you find at different layers, so I think that’s one of the coolest things about the app that you can’t get in a museum setting and you can’t get just by someone explaining to you,” Michael said. “You have to really see it.”
The app, which is currently in beta testing, will become available for public use at the “Amazing Archeology” fair at the Peabody Museum this weekend.

Governor of Rhode Island Gina M. Raimondo '93 has been elected 25th reunion chief marshal and will lead this year's Commencement exercises at Harvard’s 367th iteration of the event.
The honor is accorded to members of each year's 25th reunion class who have achieved success in their careers, contributed to their communities, and served the College, according to the Harvard Alumni Association. Notable alumni who have held this position include former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg '91.
The search for chief marshal began over a year ago when members of the class of '93 nominated their peers for the position. A committee consisting solely of members in the class of '93 then reduced almost 80 total nominations to just nine before selecting their final choice.
Raimondo graduated magna cum laude from the College and went on to earn a doctorate in sociology from Oxford University, where she was a Rhodes scholar.
After obtaining a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1998, Raimondo interned for U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood of the Southern District of New York and worked in venture capital before starting her own firm, Point Judith Capital. Raimondo then went on to serve as general treasurer for Rhode Island before running for governor in 2014. She became the first woman to hold this position. Raimondo also currently serves on the board of trustees of the Yale Corporation.
Mukesh Prasad ’93, one of the 25th reunion chairs, described Raimondo as someone who “always had an interest in serving society” and understood that “good policy is not always based on politics.”
“Governor Raimondo represents excellence in all three,” he said, referring to the domains of her profession, society, and Harvard. “We’re proud to have her represent the class of ‘93 and to represent the alumni.”
Harvard’s 367th commencement will be held on May 24, 2018. It will be livestreamed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at Stanford, Brown, and Cornell, among other schools, walked out in solidarity with the victims of last month’s Parkland shooting, while also advocating for stronger gun restrictions.
The March 14 walkout took place exactly one month after a shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., claiming the lives of 17 faculty members and students.
Because there was no central location from which to “walk out” of, as was the case with many high school walkouts on the same day, students at all three universities met at a designated spot to hold a rally for 17 minutes.
“The walkout and the concept was not designed for colleges, and that was a big thing we factored into our own event,” Brown walkout co-organizer Keiko R. Cooper-Hohn said. “It asked for us to protest by standing up and walking out of a class, but our classes are principally lecture based, so the sight of student walking in and out of lecture, you know, you don’t pay any thought to that.”
The turnout was “incredible”, according to Cooper-Hohn.
At Stanford, event co-organizer and senior Zoe A. Goldblum said she thought the turnout was also good at their rally, especially given that the university was in the midst of “dead week,” a period in which students attend the quarter’s last week of classes while also preparing for upcoming final exams.
“I think that there were mixed feelings about the turnout. I thought that the turnout was pretty good considering it was dead week. We estimated at any given point that there were about 200 to 300 people there,” Goldblum said.
At Stanford, the event was co-sponsored by several organizations, including the Jewish Student Association, the American Indian Organization, and the Black Student Union, among others.
“The reason we reached out to so many co-sponsors and so many different organizations is because we wanted to recognize and put at the center of the walkout that mass school shootings aren’t the only way people are impacted by gun violence,” Goldblum said. “In particular, marginalized communities are impacted by it everyday.”
For some students, the walkouts also served as an opportunity to engage in political activism. Cornell’s event was led by the school’s College Democrats and was organized by the club’s president, Natalie S. Brown.
“We had a very clear message that we wanted students to demand change in any ways they could, so if that meant volunteering for efforts for Democratic candidates to change gun laws is one thing, if it’s donating towards advocacy groups that are trying to change gun laws, that’s another thing,” Brown said.
“The real point was to demand action and to act upon it. Don’t be complacent,” she added.
“I’d say that the Cornell Dems did a really good job rallying everyone around the issue,” said Liel Sterling, an attendee and undergraduate at Cornell.
At Stanford, Goldblum said she also considered their walkout’s message to be political.
“I totally consider it political. I think that there were some questions about if this was in memorial or in protest, and I think that there’s no reason that it can’t necessarily be both. I think that there’s a way to honor people who have been killed while also trying to prevent the same thing from happening to other people,” she said.
At Brown, however, the message was a little different.
“I don’t think the students or the faculty here saw it as political, because we are a community that, in its most intrinsic of its values, supports the safety of its students,” Cooper-Hohn said.
Harvard and Yale, which were both on spring break at the time of the nationwide walkouts, will host separate events. At Yale, a vigil took place on Feb. 25, and a separate March for our Lives is slated to occur sometime in April, according to Ananya Kumar-Banerjee, a co-organizer of the event.
At Harvard, a sit-in is scheduled to occur on the steps of Widener Library on April 2o, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Government department held a town hall Wednesday afternoon to hear undergraduates’ concerns after Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez was accused of multiple accounts of sexual harassment spanning decades last month.
Government department chair Jennifer L. Hochschild announced the meeting in an email sent to students earlier this month that detailed several initiatives the department had taken in the wake of the allegations against Dominguez. In early March, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez of sexual misconduct. Administrators had once before published Dominguez for alleged sexual harassment in the 1980s, but that did not prevent the professor from gaining multiple administrative positions at Harvard in the years since.
In the wake of the articles, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith in early March placed Dominguez on administrative leave while the University investigates the allegations. A few days later, Dominguez announced he would retire from all administrative positions immediately and would step down from his teaching job at the end of this school year. Dominguez is on sabbatical this semester.
Hochschild hosted the off-the record discussion Wednesday, moderated by Iris Bohnet, director of the Women in Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris was also present, in addition to several Government professors and a Title IX officer.
Professor Steven R. Levitsky, who will co-chair a newly created “climate change committee” along with Hochschild, was also present to answer questions. The department established the committee earlier this month, directly following reports about Dominguez, in an effort to investigate climate issues within the department.
In an emailed statement after the event, Hochschild wrote the committee will focus on handling fallout from the Dominguez accusations going forward. She wrote the committee plans to report on its progress at some point before the end of the semester.
“Our activity at this point focuses on a new Climate Change Committee, chaired by Professor Steven Levitsky, and including faculty, students, and staff,” Hochschild wrote. “The Committee is beginning its work to frame an agenda of the most important changes to pursue, and it will create working groups to address that agenda.”
Attendee and Government concentrator Elena D. Sokoloski ’18 said she thought the discussion Wednesday was “productive.”
“I mean, I’d like it if the committee had a little bit not structure, but I get it, because people are just starting out,” Sokoloski said. “I mean, things feel much more urgent to undergraduates, who are only here for four years, as compared to faculty, who are usually here for much longer than that.”
“I’m encouraged by the tonal shift that seems to have taken place, especially amongst professors who are now also aware that this is actually an issue,” Sokoloski added.
Attendee Rocket Claman ’21, who is considering concentrating in Government, said she hopes the department will continue to remain transparent in its efforts to address climate issues.
“I know a couple of the people who are going to be on the committee who are students, and they seem very passionate and driven towards correcting this cultural issue, specifically within the Government department, so that gives me a little hope that they will actually drive the professors to get stuff done,” said Claman, an active Flyby editor.
The department held a separate meeting for faculty and Ph.D. students on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber '76 attended the biweekly Faculty Council meeting Wednesday afternoon to hear members’ thoughts on the upcoming search for the new dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Bacow’s appearance comes just days after Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith’s announcement he will step down from his position as soon as Harvard can find his successor. In an email Monday, University president Drew G. Faust wrote Bacow will take charge of the search Smith's replacement and will use it as an opportunity to learn more about the “hopes and views” of FAS affiliates. Bacow’s solicitation of feedback from the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body—marks one way in which he is carrying out Faust's words.
Council member David L. Howell called the Faculty Council's conversation with Bacow “philosophical” and said the discussion took up the bulk of the meeting. The Council considered issues the new dean would face and the qualities they wanted to see in the next dean.
Howell said he believes one of the most pertinent issues is the current devaluation of higher education in the country.
“We have that tax on the endowment and some people sort of questioning the purpose of higher education and the role of universities in society,” Howell said. “We were thinking about those sorts of challenges going forward.”
In December, Congress voted to levy a 1.4 percent tax on returns from University endowments that met a certain threshold of endowment money per student, including Harvard.
The Council also discussed preliminary plans to revamp the Q Guide, an evaluation system students use to give feedback on professors and courses. Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser presented about this topic, informing the Council that FAS will update the Q Guide’s software—a move that may permit other changes to the evaluation process, too.
Howell said the Council discussed altering the Q Guide so that questions would be better tailored to specific departments and courses.
“I think the idea is to have a system that both encourages students to respond and to make it easy and appealing to comment more because the comments, rather than the numerical scores, are—at least from the faculty point of view—a very valuable part of the evaluation,” he said.
The Council also voted in favor of a proposal from the Business School to create a new Ph.D. program in Business Administration. The general Faculty will hear the proposal at their meeting in April.
The next full Faculty meeting will be held Tuesday, April 3.

UPDATED: March 30, 2018 at 3:45 p.m.
This article is the first in a two-part series on diversity at the Harvard Kennedy School. Read the second installment here.
Shaniqua L. McClendon has often been one of the only black women in the room. Still, her first day at the Harvard Kennedy School sticks out in her memory.
Now a second-year Masters in Public Policy (MPP) student, McClendon remembers an icebreaker activity during her orientation in the fall of 2016. Students anonymously filled out questionnaires about their race, gender, and family life, shuffled the papers around, and then stood up based on the information from the paper given to them.
She said she thought this exercise was “fine enough” until she realized she was one of only two black students in her cohort and the only black woman.
“For everyone else, this was probably a great exercise, but for me and for this other student, all I had to do was look to see what the gender and race are on this piece of paper and now they know everything I was supposed to contribute anonymously,” McClendon said. “They just kind of know my whole life now.”
“I've been in places that didn't have a ton of black people or black women but this was just starkly different from my other experiences,” McClendon, who is now the president of the school’s Black Student Union, added.
The Kennedy School has struggled with diversity for years. The school established its Office of Student Diversity and Inclusion in 2012, formed a mandatory orientation program about race and gender in the classroom, and created a blog to give students the opportunity to “share their stories and experiences” involving identity at the school.
“I regularly feel uncomfortable speaking up about issues that impact people of color and low-income communities because of my identity as a woman of color,” one anonymous blog post from 2014 reads.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf convened a task force on diversity and inclusion in Jan. 2016 comprising students, staff and faculty. In May 2017, that group completed a draft report outlining demographic statistics and recommendations to increase diversity and improve the environment for students from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds.
Students and alumni said the statistics confirmed what they already knew: the school has struggled to admit and attract minority students for years, and the numbers were not rising.
According to the draft report, in the two-year Masters in Public Policy program—the largest degree program offered at HKS—African-American students represented 9 percent of students in 2005 and 4 percent in 2015. Hispanic-Americans represented 12 percent of students in 2005 and 7 percent of students in 2015, and Asian-Americans represented 10 percent of students in 2005 and 7 percent of students in 2015.
In the 10 months since its completion, the draft report has galvanized students of color at the school to demand greater and faster change. The group did not publicly release the report but provided the document to "people who have been interested in our community," Elmendorf said. He added "many other people" at the Kennedy School have also seen the draft report because "we're trying to be transparent about what we're doing."
The school’s mission—“to train public leaders and improve public policy”—only adds to the urgency of the issue, McClendon said.
“It’s important to also have people of color who are from this country going back to into their own communities,” she said. “When those are the people that are not getting into this institution, I think that we're doing a disservice to what this institution's mission says it is and what they claim they are focused [on doing].”
The Kennedy School’s diversity problem begins even before students step foot on campus, the report shows.
The number of minority applicants has increased since 2005 across all racial and ethnic groups represented in the report. The number of admits across groups, though, has plateaued over the past decade—and the percentage of admitted African-American and Latino students who ultimately choose to attend the school has declined.
From 2005 to 2015, the yield rate of African-American students dropped from 85 to 66 percent, according to the report. For students identified as Latinx, the yield dropped 92 to 71 percent in 2015. Asian-Americans saw their yield rate increase, from 67 in 2005 to 77 to 2015.
Kennedy School spokesperson Thoko Moyo declined to share more up-to-date admissions statistics with The Crimson. She also declined to comment on minority admissions and matriculation trends.
Money may play a role; the task force report specifically mentions the impact of financial aid on yield rates.
“While financial aid isn’t the only factor upon which students base their decision to join the HKS community, it clearly has some influence on that decision making,” the report reads. “There is a clear increase in yield rates between the (i) “no aid” group and the (ii) group receiving some aid.”
But Mark I. Lewis, who graduated from the Kennedy School in 2000 and currently runs an admissions consulting firm, said racial and ethnic demographics also matter. He said he has seen African-American students at both the undergraduate and graduate level apply to schools that “feel more supportive,” including historically black colleges and universities.
"The bottom line with this kind of environment is that nobody wants to be one of the rare few African-American voices,” Lewis said. “They want to be in an a place where there is a critical mass—all things being equal—but the money does play a role."
Alexandra Martinez, former Assistant Dean of Admissions at the Kennedy School, said alumni from underrepresented minority groups sometimes actively discourage admitted students from attending the school.
“I've met so many alums who have really advised others not to come to the Kennedy School over the years,” Martinez said.
Lauren R. Powell, a 2017 graduate of the Kennedy School and a former co-chair of the school’s student-run diversity committee, said conversations around diversity and inclusion at the school  are not new, which she said is disheartening to both alumni and students.
“I’m talking now to black alums from the black alumni group that are like, ‘Yeah, we’ve been having the same conversations for a while now,’” Powell said.
Natara Gray, the assistant director of Student Diversity and Inclusion, said Kennedy School affiliates are broadly aware the number of African-American students is declining, a trend she called “unfortunate.”
“Many of the students have expressed concerns about what has been going on at the Kennedy School and its diversity, and they want it to change,” she said. “In that mindset, they were concerned about asking or telling other people to come and so word of mouth is sometimes a way to get the word out.”
In response to concerns from members of the Kennedy School community about the unfavorable admissions rates, the admissions office has partnered with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at the Kennedy School to develop recruitment strategies tailored towards students of color.
“We are reworking our recruiting strategy to direct more attention to colleges and parts of this country where we think we can increase the number of people from underrepresented groups at this school,” Elmendorf said.
As part of these efforts, Gray travels around the country to recruit students of color and hosts an annual conference specifically for prospective minority students. Over the past year, she has specifically focused on recruiting from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) over the past year in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia, she said.
“I had an opportunity to work with some colleagues and peers where I decided to essentially run specific and targeted HBCU recruitment,” Gray said.
But limited funding and manpower have posed challenges; the Office of Diversity and Inclusion currently only consists of Gray and one part-time staffer.
“You have to kind of think about what you can do in a year's time frame, not just financially but also with resources of people, as you know the office right now is completely myself and the part-time person,” Gray said. “That’s been a bit of a challenge.”
One of the main recommendations of the task force report called on the school to hire an “Associate Dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” who will be charged with facilitating conversations about diversity, developing strategies to improve the school’s climate, and report on issues around diversity and inclusion at HKS. After an eight-month search process, Robbin Chapman, now an associate provost at Wellesley College, will start as the new associate dean for diversity in April.
The task force report also recommended collaborating with programs that identify “top talent from underrepresented communities”—such as Posse and New York City Urban Fellows—asking faculty to communicate with top admits via email or phone, and connecting prospective students to current students based on shared interests or identities.
Sasha Ramani, a current student ambassador with the HKS admissions office, said the database used to connect prospective students to current students now allows students to specify they are a “self-identifying person of color.”
According to Meredith Sandberg, another current student ambassador, the ambassadors’ role in the office is mainly on a volunteer basis and is focused on providing information about HKS to prospective students.
“Occasionally, the prospective students request to be connected with current students of specific backgrounds (demographic, professional, policy interest, etc) and we make our best effort to find a student who meets that request as nearly as possible and has the time to add it to their busy on campus schedule,” Sandberg wrote in an email Thursday.
The dean said the school began implementing more of the task force’s recommendations over the past year for the Class of 2019.
Gray said the dean and administrators “wholeheartedly” support initiatives to increase minority recruitment.
“We'll continue having conversations, and we'll continue to recruit and continue to be out there finding the unheard voices and bringing them to the Kennedy School,” she said.
For the relatively few minority students who do make the decision to come to Cambridge, the dearth of students who share their racial or ethnic identity can translate into uncomfortable experiences in the classroom.
Meredith D. Tavera, a second year Masters in Public Policy student and a co-chair of the Latinx Caucus at the Kennedy School, said the Latinx population—both in the caucus and the school in general—is “quite small.”
“I think most of us feel that we can count on our hands the number of Latinx people at the school,” Tavera said.
M.P.P. student Claris J. Chang said she saw the lack of diversity at the school when she was placed into her cohort. At the Kennedy School, students are placed in cohorts of about 60 people each, Chang said, and hers included four Asian American women.
“I was noting that Asian Americans in our classes were noticeably quieter and less folded into the overarching culture,” Chang, who is Taiwanese-American, said.
This effect is especially noticeable, she said, at a school focused on politics and social change.
“We're here at a school that talks about what we can do, but we forget to ask who we're doing it for and what their needs are,” she said. “It's so important that we actually have those perspectives that are being shared in the classroom and we have conversations about what those perspectives are that are missing.”
In the wake of the task force report, those conversations have multiplied—particularly within student affinity and advocacy groups. Students are calling for better recruitment outreach, support, and programming for minority students at the Kennedy School.
The Black Student Union at the Harvard Kennedy School sent Elmendorf an official response to the report, laying out their own recommendations for the Kennedy School to adopt.
“As you embark on a final set of recommendations, we hope that you will proactively engage black students, faculty, and staff who can candidly speak to our experiences and provide the necessary context to guide your decision making,” the response reads. “Additionally, we hope that the final report includes more detailed recommendations with measurable goals and a timeline for implementation.”
BSU leaders, including McClendon, met with the dean several times to speak about initiatives the group hopes to implement, including additional events centered around diverse speakers and a “formalized” recruitment and outreach strategy for students of color.
“Part of the reason I wanted to be the BSU President was specifically to work on this work,” McClendon said. “It's really important to me that as I leave and graduate that whatever students come after me have a good experience and have a better experience than I have had.”
Powell, who described the task force report as “very elementary,” said the student-run Diversity Committee has led many discussions around diversity-related concerns at the school, and that she thinks the report did not do enough to address these concerns.
“It’s really, for me, another exercise of checking the box to say that the school is committed to diversity without actually committing to action,”  Powell said.
Elmendorf said he and other administrators are actively working to make changes at the school.
“We are proceeding to implement the recommendations of the task force. It is a priority of mine and of the other leaders of the Kennedy School to create a more diverse and inclusive environment,” Elmendorf said. “I think to make these changes, in the way that should be made, took a longer time than I or other members of our community would like.”
The pace of change remains slow in part because of frequent student turnover, Powell said. Most of the Kennedy School’s degree programs do not last longer than two years, so sustaining student activism can prove challenging. Powell said that, while she headed the Diversity Committee, she often heard students voice concerns that diversity initiatives tend to get caught in bureaucratic limbo.
“The committee loses momentum but… the quick turnover of students work[s] in the favor of the administration because the students who are really fired up about diversity will eventually leave soon or later because their program is at maximum two years,” Powell said.
“It works in their favor to beat around the bush and to push things off as long as they can and as long as they need to,” she added.
Elmendorf said successfully addressing issues related to diversity and inclusion requires a lengthy process.
“I share the frustration of members that we are not making faster progress, but doing the sorts of changes that we need to do right takes time,” he said.
The task force report bluntly acknowledges in its introduction that making strides on diversity will not be easy.
“The Kennedy School should be a place where every student, staff person, and faculty member feels that they belong,” the report reads. “But creating that sense of belonging and the reality of inclusion is hard work.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 29, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated none of the Kennedy School's degree programs last longer than two years. In fact, most of the Kennedy School's degree programs do not last longer than two years.

For Flyby Matchmaker 2018’s first date, we craftily chose two young men with similar names: Tomasz P. Wojtasik ’21 and Thomas G. Dumbach ’18. Despite the age difference, they bonded over breakfast at the Harvard Art Museums Cafe (courtesy of yours truly). We caught up with them after the date to hear all about their impressions.
Tomasz: He showed up late but I’m early for everything and it was a Sunday morning, so it’s fine.
Thomas: I think I was running on Harvard time. The instructions said to meet at the cafe, so I wasn’t sure if he would be there.
Tomasz: The cafe was pretty empty so he just walked over to me.
Thomas: It became quite apparent when I strolled to the entrance, I think there was maybe some old couple and a single, young Harvard student.
Tomasz: I had actually met him before, because he had run the freshman intramural spelling bee, so it was more of a second impression.
Thomas: It took me a few minutes to realize. He started talking about his passionate involvement with freshman intramural sports, and then I said, “Oh yeah, I remember.”
Tomasz: We started with the typical Harvard stuff, and then we talked about how classes were going, politics, housing for next year…Even though we’re in different years we know some of the same people. We both have an interest for languages.
Thomas: The conversation was smooth. I loved the setting because art museums are kind of where I go to relax. It’s here but it feels like it’s not quite campus.
Tomasz: We mostly stayed in the cafe. We walked around to find a painting to take the selfie with, but other than that we were in the cafe.
Thomas: Once someone is here [at Harvard] we’re kind of speaking the same language. He’s a freshman but he took a gap year, so [the age difference] is not a big issue.
Tomasz: In terms of relationship potential, it’s a bit weird because he’s leaving in like two months…I’m not sure if it’s worth it, if that makes sense.
What’s an even better story than “we met at the freshman intramural spelling bee”? Obviously, meeting at a Matchmaker blind date. T and T may have to part ways at the end of the semester, but they clearly look great together (with or without Van Gogh). Plus, as Wojtasik put it, “The food was really good. So, for the future, the cafe is a great place to go.”
You heard it from him. If you want to find true love over quiche, muffins, and cappuccino, sign up for Matchmaker here. We promise you’ll have something (although maybe not a name) in common with your date.
xoxo,Flyby Matchmaker

Just tonight, following the Battle for Yardfest in Sanders Theater, the CEB announced this year’s Yardfest headliners: Wale and Lil Yachty.
The D.C. native and the “bubblegum trap” god will surely put on a good outdoor show, which we’ll all be “Chillin” at. The CEB’s pick of two well-known rap artists is welcome after two years of EDM, and er...Jessie J.
I’m personally overjoyed, having worshipped the Wale poster in my room since the seventh grade, and also having endured my dad’s purposeful mispronunciations of his name as “Whale” since then. (For those of you who aren’t hip, Wale is pronounced Wah-lay. And for those whose primary exposure to rap music is at final club parties, you know him from his “Look ma, no hands” verse. As for Lil Yachty, he’s the guy on “Broccoli”’s opening verse, and he also had a verse on “iSpy.”)
While Wale has been a big name for a decade, Lil Yachty, at only 20 years old, is up-and-coming. Before his music career seriously launched, Yachty modeled Yeezy’s Yeezy line at Madison Square Garden, and he originally hails from Atlanta. His features on the aforementioned frat playlist tracks skyrocketed him to fame, and he recently released his second album, creatively titled Lil Boat 2 (the follow up to Lil Boat).
So if you still got your Nike Boots, and a gold grill lying around, break them out in time for April 13th.
