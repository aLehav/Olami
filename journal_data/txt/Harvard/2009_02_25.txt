After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the recent economic downturn has left more families than ever before in need of financial aid, the difficulty of the paperwork that financial-aid applications require has reached an unnecessary high. In times like these, it is disheartening that the current Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form poses a major barrier to many potential applicants who need financial aid the most. With more than 100 questions, the current form—which, ironically enough, was created in the early 1990s in an effort to streamline the financial-aid process—seems excessive and inefficiently constructed. Its length and complexity are so daunting that many have been driven to use paid professionals just to fill out the form. Everyone from Congress to President Obama has complained about FAFSA’s structure, which is especially troubling given that, despite its prodigious size, it still fails to take into account assets such as some family homes and even businesses. Therefore, it succeeds in inconveniencing students but not in providing the information that schools actually need to make proper determinations in the allocation of their financial-aid resources. The length and complexity of the FAFSA form may also have the unfortunate consequence of preventing some people in need from applying for or receiving financial aid. It is especially unsettling that the people hurt most by such a complex form are very likely those who come from families of lower educational status and who most need financial assistance to attend college. The Department of Education should therefore try to shorten and simplify the form in any way possible—though we hope that potential streamlining does not engender a wave of supplemental questionnaires required by individual schools. To ensure that the sheer length and complexity of the FAFSA form does not discourage potential applicants from applying, Harvard should commit itself to offering assistance to applicants who cannot decipher the unfortunately labyrinthine financial-aid process on their own. Paying for college is already difficult enough—the last thing we need is for the paperwork to be an obstacle, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a meeting with the Harvard Allston Task Force on Monday night, Allston residents erupted in anger and frustration over the university’s ambiguous plans regarding Allston development progression. In particular, residents expressed concern over Harvard’s continued acquisition of property while it has simultaneously enacted plans to slow the building of the new science complex. Residents are worried that a slowing pace of construction in Allston will mean leaving these purchased properties vacant—preventing other businesses from entering the area. The university has already slowed its purchase of raw materials intended for use in later phases of the science center project.Though the vocal indignation of residents can seem off-putting, the university should recognize an important change in the message it is now receiving: Many Allston residents understand the positive value of Harvard’s developments on their side of the river, and they want Harvard to proceed with construction as scheduled.Allston residents are correct to be dismayed by the construction slowdown. The new science complex and the rest of the Allston project will benefit the university in a host of ways over the long run, but we can only receive those benefits once the project is complete and operational. Moreover, the project will improve the city of Allston’s economy, infrastructure, and culture—benefits that will be stalled if Harvard simply buys and holds unused property. Harvard must view it as an essential priority both for the residents of Allston and for the university community to use whatever resources are available to maintain the anticipated pace of Allston construction.This exhortation particularly applies to the science complex portion of the development program. The university plans to finish laying its foundation, but the slowdown as proposed will slow or stop the later phases of the project.The university has fought a constant struggle with the Allston community over the details of the expansion across the river. But now, at this point in the construction, a chorus of residents finally agrees that the continuation of Harvard’s growth across the river is in residents’ best interest. We encourage both sides to see this as a new common ground for the furthering of the Allston project. If the university fails to recognize and capitalize on this newfound enthusiasm for construction, it will surrender an opportunity for goodwill and progress with our Allston neighbors. Of course, most importantly, delaying Allston construction jeopardizes the future vitality of our university in favor of extreme spending trepidation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’d have to be living under a rock these days not to notice the grim state of the American economy. The financial crisis of last October has spiraled into a cataclysmic near-total collapse, with official unemployment figures spiking at 7.6 percent this month. President Obama has already made plans to resuscitate the economy through a massive stimulus package while somehow reducing the largest peacetime budget deficit in American history. 
Of course, things could be worse—Latvia’s economy is projected to shrink by as much as 12 percent over the next fiscal year. But, more importantly for us undergraduates, the financial crisis has the potential to force Harvard students into reconsidering their postgraduate plans. For the Class of 2009, it may already be too late. For those of us who still have a little time left at the College, however, it is high time to reconsider the trade-school mentality that has characterized our campus in recent decades.
By no means am I parroting the traditional critique of the recruiting process, which I understand is a legitimate and very necessary function of our advanced postindustrial economy. This is especially true of highly competitive industries like the financial services sector, in which on-campus recruiting is essential in funneling elite students into elite firms; the process allows students’ careers to blossom and the economy to grow. I do question, however, its scale at institutions like Harvard. Last year, more than two-fifths of last year’s graduating class funneled themselves into one small sector of the giant American economy.
Nor is this massive influx of Harvard undergraduates into the financial sector a recent phenomenon. For more than two decades, investment banks and consulting firms have had a firm chokehold on the postgraduate dreams of many ambitious Harvard students. Renowned journalist Jennifer 8. Lee ’98-99 has aptly described the entire recruiting process as “a complicated rite of courtship, complete with flirting (invitations), wooing (interviews), and proposals (offers).”
In light of the current economic situation, this mentality must change. In particular, the annual ritual of the junior-year finance internship search—which has given rise to a disturbing sense of entitlement—must be reined in. It is one thing to offer valuable pre-professional opportunities to interested students; it is entirely another to create a disturbing subculture of hyper-competitiveness that destroys the very foundation of the liberal-arts education Harvard claims to offer. And the devastating consequences of rejection can be damaging to one’s mental health—a concern not often realized by the eager droves of applicants who dive into the process without considering the real impact of the application process on their personal lives.
Moreover, with the once-rosy prospects of the financial industry now a distant memory, undergraduates here at the College—and at similar institutions—must realize that the days of simply expecting a firm to offer lucrative summer internships to nearly every qualified applicant are over. Unfortunately, most summer internships do not cover rent and plane tickets or offer a lavish monthly bonus—the way things are going now, you may not be paid at all. Those Harvard students who simply assumed that an entry-level analyst position would somehow magically materialize for them will now have to learn the hard way that finding a summer job is a truly difficult process. 
Regardless of what my peers choose to do this summer—some will indeed be working at finance firms, while others may travel, volunteer, or work in different industries—we should all keep in mind that there are many other careers besides that of an entry-level financier. We should all sit down and actually think about what we want to do with our lives—and by that I mean more than the first job after graduation. The financial crisis should serve as an opportunity for every undergraduate at the College to ponder their life goals, their ambitions, and the hard truths of economic reality. If we can do that, then the rest of the process should be a piece of cake.

Eugene Kim ’10, a Crimson associate editorial editor, is a history concentrator in Kirkland House. He does not yet have a summer job and wishes everyone the best of luck in these tough times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1950, the People’s Republic of China invaded and occupied the peaceful mountain nation of Tibet. For 58 years, the Communist regime in Beijing has waged a quiet war against the Tibetan people and their unique culture. Their clandestine methods follow the guidelines established by their imperialist predecessors: hide Tibet’s holy relics, erode traditional Tibetan practices, and fill the vacuum with Chinese culture. The evil genius behind the Chinese plan—and perhaps the only reason why the suppression of Tibet has not garnered much attention in the Western world—is that the Chinese government has undertaken this attack under the guise of technology and progress. 
First, to debase Tibetan culture and broadcast authority, the Chinese government has conspicuously placed signs of Chinese culture on top of Tibetan ones. The government has planted a television tower atop the Iron Mountain—a sacred landmass in the center of Lhasa, Tibet’s Holy City. This eyesore casts its shadow on some of the most important relics of the Buddhist world, belittling Tibetan identity both physically and figuratively. Centuries ago, the Iron Mountain served as a principal shrine for medical studies. Now, Tibetan identity comes second to Chinese cable. 
Signs of subjugation even infiltrate the intimate spaces of Tibetan life. The streets outside Lhasa are lined with brand new houses and schools built by the Chinese government, a definite improvement from the old clay huts that used to stand there. However, each of these buildings was built with a Chinese flag on the roof. At the same time, the display of the Tibetan flag has been banned at many of these new buildings, especially the schools. When peaceful demonstrators in the Ma Ngoe township tried to replace the Chinese flag on their public school with a Tibetan flag, five truckloads of Chinese security forces arrived on the scene. There is a hidden motive behind the technology and development that the Chinese government has brought to Tibet. Because of the television tower, the Tibetans cannot rebuild the shrine that used to stand atop the Iron Mountain. Because of the Chinese flags on top of their roofs, Tibetans can no longer decorate their homes and schools with prayer flags—one of the most important traditions of Tibetan life. Television and new homes are in themselves beneficial to the Tibetans, but the Chinese have used them to inhibit traditional Tibetan practices and make Chinese culture more visible. 
While slowly creating a cultural void in Tibet, the Chinese government has also laid the groundwork for filling it. Thousands of kilometers of railway have been built connecting Lhasa to many major Chinese cities: The express train from Beijing was completed in 2006, and luxury cars will be running in 2009. Having erased Tibetan culture, China will pump in its own. 
Not only can the Chinese get to Tibet fast, they have good reason to do so. Tibet is a fresh market for China’s rapidly growing economy, and its relative lack of indigenous capital makes it an easy target for predatory Chinese corporations. If that weren’t incentive enough, rampant housing discrimination makes Tibet a nice prospect for any Chinese entrepreneur. Most of the new subsidized housing—which the Chinese government made room for by razing thousands of Tibetan monuments—are given to new “Chinese settlers” to provide these new-age colonizers with the most comfortable facilities available. If current trends continue, the Tibetans may become a minority in their own homeland.
Many Tibetans have reacted against Chinese control. The “Free Tibet” movement is gaining publicity and popularity. Chinese atrocities toward the Tibetans are being uncovered daily. But this revolutionary contingent remains small. Most Tibetans still preserve their piety in the face of degradation. When a television tower is dumped on their shrine, most Tibetans simply smile and keep on praying. Their transcending peacefulness is inspiring, but it will not save their culture. 
We cannot continue to ignore Tibet, nor can we continue to balk when human rights are in danger. The UN, NATO, the United States—any organization or nation with significant international sway—need to put pressure on the Chinese government to cease its suppression of the Tibetan people. The world learned the terrible consequences of imperialism long ago, and we must stamp it out entirely wherever it rears its ugly head. Tibet and its people are some of the world’s most beautiful remaining examples of piety, brotherhood, and peacefulness. But, if we wait much longer, Tibet will cease to exist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College prides itself on a diverse student body, a restless social conscience and concern for the less fortunate, and, of course, a boundless tolerance for all cultures, creeds, and sexual pastimes.
Indeed, the slightest insensitive insinuation is roundly condemned, its perpetrators publicly renounced, and multicultural organizations tasked to host community “conversations” and “raise awareness” to repair the damage. One need not unduly exert his memory to find copious examples. The Salient—Harvard’s impeccably edited premier journal of opinion—several years ago printed a parody of a Barbie-type doll marketed in the Middle East to criticize some of the more repressive policies of the region’s regimes. Unsurprisingly, many campus Muslims interpreted this spoof as a slight to their religion and released a deluge of offended dispatches to House e-mail lists as well as pointed Crimson opinion pieces and letters to the editor. All of this culminated in a session of hand-wringing and finger-pointing, sponsored by the healers at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.
More recently, a Crimson sports columnist criticized Dartmouth’s politically correct apology for scheduling a hockey game against an opponent with an Indian mascot. He ended his remarks with what, in retrospect, seemed like an ill-advised turn of phrase, speculating that, had the Harvard ladies’ basketball team played Arkansas State, “the Crimson would’ve slaughtered the Indians.” As expected, the Native American community responded with a shrill round of protests and recriminations—the most dramatic of all from a freshman of the Shinnecock tribe, describing how “the image that went into my head was me, my baby cousin, and my family lying dead in a pool of blood.”
Indignant and self-righteous responses to real or perceived provocations, indeed, have remained a constant fixture in the Harvard multicultural dialogue. S. Allen Counter, the gregarious and garrulous head of the Harvard Foundation, is himself prone to overwrought bursts of sentiment on such occasions. Amid the infamous “Quad incident” of 2007, Dr. Counter denounced the “apartheid techniques” of the Harvard University Police, who, responding to calls, had checked the IDs of Black Student Association picnickers and allowed their field day to continue unmolested. Dr. Counter is not above retaliatory insinuations himself, either—as he once labeled his media critics as “Crimson writers active in Hillel.”
So, in a college community where possible insensitivity is often handled, so to speak, insensitively, one ought to expect any violations—intentional or not—to be descried and those offended to be succored. Yet recent events in Eliot House demonstrate exactly the limits of open-mindedness and the extent of hypocrisy.
The most apparently popular submission for the Eliot House freshman day T-shirt featured the likeness of House Master Lino Pertile as the character of Don Vito Corleone, the eponymous crime boss in The Godfather. An Eliot House resident, who was also a member of the Italian American Association, had written to the e-mail list explaining that the implicit association of “mobsters” with Italian culture still offends many people who share her heritage and requested they consider another design for the shirt. The message was polite, made no accusations, and presumed upon Harvard students’ justly famous cultural understanding.
To the contrary, many did not conform to that benevolent stereotype. Many contributors to the Eliot e-mail list feigned outrage that “political correctness” could impede upon their Housing Day festivities. Others dismissed her concern as baseless or even insulting to other groups who have to endure apparently more hurtful discrimination. One respondent even marshaled statistics to demonstrate the factual basis for the association between Italians and organized crime. Many did not eschew ad hominem attacks—or harassing phone calls, angry personal e-mails, and judgmental stares in the dining hall. 
Pertile, in an e-mail circulated throughout the House, explained that he personally did not find the shirt design offensive but understood how many could and especially was worried that it might put off some of the incoming freshmen. Such prudence, indeed, eluded many in the Eliot House community for days—some of whom, as members of minority cultural groups, expectedly would have been more sympathetic to how certain stereotypes can offend.
If Harvard should continue to boast of its politically correct values and dedication to multicultural awareness and understanding, it ought to extend that sensitivity to every culture. To question whether Italian-Americans deserve that consideration—being largely considered, on everything from census forms to college applications, as generically “white”—or whether the mobster stereotype legitimately can offend is unfair. Certainly few questioned the rights of Native Americans and Muslims to cavil about The Salient or the Crimson sports page for their commentary. In this instance, however, the parody of The Godfather does not intend to illuminate any larger issue, political or cultural—it is admittedly a joke. To the critical observer of collegiate political correctness, this episode begs the question: Where is the outrage? Where is the consistency? Where, we may wonder, is Dr. Counter?

When’s the last time you saw your professor on the street in nothing but booty shorts and a pair of rollerblades? If you’re interested in seeing a video, just visit Professor Oliver R. Knill’s personal blog, easily found on the Math 21b course Web site. Knill’s blog is part of his open and informal approach to teaching. He says that developing a personal connection with students can help to prevent students from feeling overwhelmed in large lectures.“I think these courses are very hard­—the typical student works very hard. They are stressed and oftentimes pushed to the limit. It can be difficult for students to feel comfortable asking questions, and engaging in discussion,” Knill said.“I stripped once for a demonstration,” he said. “I think it relaxes everyone. I think they appreciate it.”Associate Professor Stephen L. Burt, who teaches English 10b, also maintains a personal blog. Even though there’s a link on the syllabus, he is less eager than Knill to share it with his students.“I don’t point it out because it’s a personal blog. Those are blogs that don’t have to do with the course I’m teaching,” Burt said. “I don’t tell students to read my personal blog, I want them to read more Wordsworth.”Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11, who is currently enrolled in English 10b, agrees with Burt. “I don’t think sharing one’s personal life is necessary,” she said. “But I think it’d be interesting as long as it’s not TMI.” If Fitzpatrick’s definition of “TMI” includes bare chests, then perhaps Knill’s class isn’t for her. Several former students of Math 21b share vivid memories of the time Knill calculated the flux of his nipple in class.However, some students welcome this bare-all attitude in the faculty. Jennifer Y. Chang ’11, for example, believes that Knill’s openness improves the learning experience. “He always seems extremely approachable, and very open and flexible,” she says.While students probably don’t want to see professors in their Facebook news feeds, professorial personal blogs can provide a delicious glimpse into the lives of the tenured.

But Kaiser’s deliberate enunciation, enthralling as it is haunting, is tinged with the darkness of his academic specialty—and his own past.
Kaiser did not think he would finish his last year of high school. At age 17 he left his home to live with three 22-year-old musicians in their attic. "I had a fairly chaotic and sometimes scary life," he says. He did ultimately graduate and even ended up applying to the University of Oregon—in no small part because the application was only one side of a sheet of paper. For the next two years Kaiser says he drifted through college as an undeclared major, more interested in Oregon’s gay rights battles than in going to class. 
Eventually, exhausted from the chaos of the political involvement and worn out from the ugly language hurled at him, he turned to Victorian literature. "I wanted to seek refuge in beautiful language," Kaiser says. "There were so many shadowy silent spaces that needed to be filled with language." Kaiser’s passion for Victorian literature turned him from a wandering, undeclared college student into an expert in the field and an assistant professor at Harvard. He now teaches the popular course, English 156: "Crime and Horror in Victorian Literature and Culture" to more than 450 students. 
Kaiser says he attended graduate school and pursued a career in academia because it allowed him to dedicate his life to his intellectual passion. For students like Kaiser, this route often naturally leads to a career as a professor because along the way they discover a need to share their passion with the rest of the world. For others, becoming a professor has always been the ultimate goal. Whether it’s happenstance or raw ambition, the ivory tower holds some kind of allure for many who step inside its doors.
"If you really love a field, you see it everywhere," Brian M. Weller ’09 explains. The bespectacled senior’s face lights up as he jokes about his obsession with economics. He constantly apologizes for what he sees as his overly "nerdy" interest in the subject.
As a freshman, he says he often annoyed his friends by taking an economic view of ordinary situations. "I’d have a marginal cost, marginal benefit type of analysis," he says. But Weller was an economics whiz kid even before he was accepted by Harvard. When his high school Advanced Placement economics teacher was out much of the year due to illness, Weller sometimes taught the class in place of the substitute. His mother, Leslie A. Weller, recalls the nightly phone calls from other students asking her son for help. "Teachers would refer kids to Brian," she says. "They said, ‘Call Brian, he’ll help you.’"
Weller finished his AP economics exams so early that he had enough time left over to pen some poetry. Along with responses about supply and demand and opportunity cost, his AP graders discovered a haiku and a sonnet in his response book. Weller recalls the experience fondly: "I think I wrote the longer one for macro because it was easier." Unlike Weller, Kaiser took the winding road to discover his hidden passion, which he did not find until he became an English major. After that, there was no turning back. "Once that love affair with Victorian literature began, my path into academia was pretty clear," he says. By the time he entered his English Ph.D. program, he was intent on becoming a professor. "It doesn’t make a lot of sense, in literary studies at least, to work for a Ph.D. unless you are going to be a professor," Kaiser says.
For Kaiser, it was authors like Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde, people who he says existed outside society’s power structure, who drew him to academia. For Maria Tatar, professor of Germanic Languages and Literature, it was Franz Kafka and Thomas Mann who she says initially drew her in. She chose graduate school because she viewed it as the next logical step to nurture her love of reading. Tatar began to investigate the Grimm’s Fairy Tales and stumbled upon a virtually unmined trove of literary wealth in these two volumes of tales told to generations of children the world over. "For me it was almost a way of knitting together my role as a parent and as a professor," Tatar says. 
By also looking at the effects of these violent stories on children, she helped lay the groundwork for the field that would become Childhood Studies, which examines literature written for children. She now leads the popular Literature and Arts A-17: "Childhood: Its History, Philosophy, and Literature." "Teaching really is a way to give back," she says. "You don’t have to be a lawyer or a doctor in order to do that." 
RESEARCH
For Lisa Randall ’83, Harvard’s first female tenured theoretical physicist, an intense interest in research led her down the academic path. As the author of "Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s Hidden Dimensions," she was named one of Time Magazine’s "100 Most Influential People of 2007."
Although she is now a frontrunner in research on particle physics and cosmology, Randall initially viewed academia as one of many potential career options. She says she realized it would probably be harder to return to research after another career than to begin in research and then transition to another field. But when she was applying for professorial positions, she found she did actually want to teach along with conducting research. "I realized that I really did care," she says. 
A similar devotion to research pulls Harvard senior Allen Cheng ’09 to academia. He currently works in a lab to screen for enzyme-inhibiting compounds. "You’re discovering something new," Cheng says of his desire to contribute to the scientific body of knowledge, "You’re not simply living in the status quo."
But Cheng’s interest in becoming a professor is not solely based on research. After working as an organic chemistry teaching fellow for the past two years, Cheng knows he would also enjoy instructing others. "It’s really a personal matter of finding something very interesting," he says.
Lisa J. Miracchi ’09 also has dreams of becoming a professor. Like Cheng's, this desire stems from a deep interest in her area of study—philosophy. Miracchi says she used to want to be an architect or perhaps a "starving artist." However, in order to fulfill her goal of studying abroad in Italy, Miracchi first had to double up on her philosophy concentration requirements. It was with this course load that she began to suspect she might want to become a philosophy professor. Even as she was studying gorgeous Florentine architecture, she found herself thinking about metaphysics and epistemology. It was then she knew she was ready to devote her life to the specialty Miracchi describes as "the study of what there is and how we know what there is."
TO THE PODIUM
Like Cheng and Miracchi, a specific passion for their area of expertise pushed Kaiser, Tatar, and Randall all into their professorial positions. However, some current students have much more direct visions of becoming professors. They have long dreamed of the days when they will prepare lectures rather than problem sets. 
For example, even before Weller was wowing his AP graders, he was already fascinated with economics. At age 17, he attended the Pennsylvania Governor’s School for International Studies, a summer program for high school students. Until that point he had primarily studied math and science. However, instead of spending his summer at the Pennsylvania Governor’s School for the Sciences, he decided to explore his burgeoning interest in economics. That summer’s survey course convinced him to continue exploring the field.
However, becoming a professor was not Weller’s only option for pursuing his interest in economics. He knew that there is often much more money to be made outside the hallowed halls of academia. But after a summer working in the private sector for Citadel Investment Group, Weller knew that inside those hallowed halls was exactly where he wanted to be.
Before working at this hedge fund, Weller had served as a research assistant to Aleh Tsyvinski, the current co-director of Yale’s Macroeconomics Program. During his time at Citadel, Weller saw the difference between researching for industry and researching in a university setting. 
"At the end of the day your knowledge and your efforts are restricted to making money," he says about his summer experience. He resented being forced to limit himself to activities that were likely to produce profits. [SEE CORRECTION BELOW]
Since confirming his original sense that he was bound for a career in academia, Weller has worked hard to structure his time in college to make his graduate school application as competitive as possible. 
"My focus has been extremely tight," he says. "It’s been, ‘I need to do this for grad school. I need to take these classes. I need to excel in one specific area of economics, write a great thesis, really drill down into something.’" 
Years before Weller attended that fateful summer program, psychology professor Steven Pinker was trying to figure out where his interests would lead him. 
Sitting in his office, framed by large windows offering an expansive view of Boston, Pinker recalls his path to William James Hall. 
When he first discovered that think tanks are organizations that pay people for their ideas, Pinker was set on working for one. "I really want to think, and solve problems, and debate, and learn," the college student told his mother.
She had a different idea in mind. 
"You belong in a university," she replied.
"At the time I wasn’t completely aware of the fact that university professors both taught and did research," Pinker says. 
Armed with this new information, Pinker knew his mother was right. "As soon as I realized that that’s what university professors did, I knew that was what I wanted to do, that you could actually be paid for thinking," Pinker says.
He is now a highly respected professor, named by Time Magazine named one of the Most Influential People of 2004. He is also the author of best-selling popular psychology books including "How the Mind Works" and "The Stuff of Thought."  
THE FAMILY FACTOR
Family influence has also contributed to current Harvard students’ dreams of becoming professors. Daniel J. Thorn ’11 arrived on campus just over a year and a half ago, and he has every intention of sticking around. With several professors in his family, Thorn was exposed to academia from a young age. In speaking with members of the History of Science faculty, Thorn says he has found the life of inquiry he wants in a community of the intellectually engaged. 
"You kind of get the impulse not to leave," Thorn says, pointing to the economy that might dissuade his peers from entering the traditional job market in two years. Thorn says he has already been mistaken for a graduate student but "it’s more of a factor of looking old for my age rather than being innately professorial." In fact, he says the biggest indicator of his scholarly goals is how he avoids studying: "When I procrastinate, I read the internet comic Ph.D. about doctoral candidates."
A desire for intellectual freedom explains how Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw wound up in academia. After chairing the Council of Economic Advisors for two years under the Bush administration, he now teaches Social Analysis 10: "Principles of Economics." His Principles of Economics textbooks are used in high schools and colleges around the world.
"They pay us to do what we want to do," Mankiw says. "You can think about the problems that interest you. You have a tremendous amount of freedom to come and go as you please," he adds.
Of his own graduating class at Princeton, Mankiw says the beckon of the ivory tower only reached a certain kind of student. "Those of us who became professors were slightly ‘nerdier’ on average than those who went for professional degrees." Mankiw actually started out in the latter camp, initially attending law school while earning his economics Ph.D. But he dropped the J.D. half of his joint-degree program after a year and a half. "I eventually decided my comparative advantage lay in economics," he says. 
A DIFFERENT ROAD ALTOGETHER
And of course, in between the tenured professors at the end of the road and the undergraduates about to travel down the path their academic destination, there are those midway through the journey to academia. 
When sociology graduate student Van C. Tran was deciding what he might like to do with his life, he looked around for a role model and a career goal. He found both in his thesis adviser, a sociology professor named Philip Kasinitz. "I thought [being a professor] was the best job in the world I could possibly have," Tran says.
Tran has been at Harvard for several years, but ten years ago, when he arrived in the U.S. from Vietnam, earning a Ph.D. was nowhere on his radar. At the time, he spoke no English. He had lived seven of his 19 years in Thailand’s refugee camps. After his family landed in New York City, he found a job in a hardware store. 
Tran says his life changed one fateful snowy day. Every day he passed the local community college, and on one afternoon he finally decided to check it out. He asked about his educational options and the receptionist handed him an application. After completing his associate’s degree, Tran went on to Hunter College to earn a Bachelor’s Degree in sociology. As he wrote his thesis on the experience of Tibetan refugees in New York, Tran worked one-on-one with Kasinitz. 
Tran saw in his mentor’s lifestyle the only kind of life he wanted for himself. In the summer of his junior year, he brought up this goal in a weekly meeting with Kasinitz. He told his mentor that he wanted to apply to graduate schools–but only in New York so he could stay close to his family. "I said it very gingerly because I wasn’t sure how he would react," he says.
However, his mentor responded encouragingly. "I was practically by the door, when he looked at me and said, ‘But you should also apply to Harvard and Princeton,’" Tran remembers. Thinking the professor was addressing someone else, Tran looked over his shoulder. "Are you talking to me?"
Kasinitz laughed. 
Now, as a resident tutor in Lowell House, it is Tran’s turn to advise his own students on graduate school.
Whether serendipity lands them in the lecturer’s seat, or that spot behind the podium was the goal all along, professors find different routes to the ivory tower. With his own wayward path to success as a frame of reference, Kaiser holds a respect for students at the center of his identity. "When I teach I address students as if they’re adults instead of my children," he says. "I don’t look at students as lacking, in desperate need of being corrected, bundles of chaos that need to be brought into the light."
While some students dream of getting to a tenured destination, others find immersion in academia is the only way to feed the fire of their intellectual passion. There are many roads to academic greatness. Who knows where the next Kaiser will come from? He may be living in an attic right now. 
CORRECTION
The Feb. 26 magazine article “Freshman to Faculty” incorrectly stated that Brian M. Weller ’09 resented working at the Citadel Investment Group. In fact, Weller said he loved his experience there, though he decided to pursue academia instead.

by JULIA S. CHENSwimming in the Mediterranean; hiking through Israel’s deserts, mountains, and valleys; hanging out with young Israeli soldiers—sounds like a fantasy vacation. If you’re lucky enough to be Jewish, you can have all this for free just by going on a Birthright trip.Taglit-Birthright is the organization which provides 10-day, all-expense paid trips to Israel for Jewish youth ages 18 to 26. This umbrella organization funds trips that are designed and led by more than 20 trip organizers. These trips must  all follow the Taglit-Birthright guidelines but differ slightly in certain activities and excursions. While the trips are open to anyone with Jewish heritage, there are specially designed trips that cater to those of the Orthodox or Reform persuasion, or those who just love to hike.The organization was founded in 2000 and, as of fall 2008, has sent nearly 200,000 young Jewish adults, 70 percent of whom are American, to Israel. The organization aims to encourage participants to form a strong personal connection with Israel, the Jewish people, and with their own Jewish identities.BIRTHRIGHT: HARVARD EDITIONOf course, Harvard has their own edition of Birthright, known as Harvard Hillel Taglit-Birthright. One aspect of the Harvard Hillel program that distinguishes it from other programs is its partnership with Shorashim, a non-profit organization that strives to bring Israeli and North American Jewish people closer together. Because of this partnership, the Harvard Hillel trip is organized so that Israeli soldiers join the participants for the full 10 days, whereas on most other trips, soldiers are only present for a few days.“Those guys made the trip very fun and provided an insiders’ look. They lived there, those were their streets,” said Fabian A. Poliak ’11 who went on the Harvard Hillel trip last spring. If it wasn’t for the soldiers’ presence, said Poliak, “it would just be a group of American Jews in an isolated bubble and it would be hard for anyone to penetrate that bubble.” Poliak said he was so inspired by these soldiers that he took to doing 60 push-ups a day after seeing them do their daily 300.Because Israeli citizens are required to join the army for a minimum of two years when they turn 18, the soldiers who participated on the Harvard Hillel trips were approximately the same age as the students. Anna M. Kamerow ’11, another participant of last year’s trip, said that, of the relationships with the soldiers, “people got very close. [It was] absolutely necessary to interact with people same age and same life.”KEEPING THE FAITHThe Harvard Hillel program prides itself on creating trips that are uniquely personal and have lasting effects. As the Harvard Hillel Birthright Israel Campus Coordinator, Jason D. Pressberg is dedicated to being personally available to guide participants through the registration process, the pre-departure orientation, and the actual trip, which he helps to lead. In order to perpetuate the trip’s mission, Pressberg encourages participants to develop their Jewish identities when they return from Israel by being active in Hillel and Birthright alumni events.Pressberg himself went on a different Taglit-Birthright trip several years ago, which he said gave him a distinctive perspective on the organization. Pressberg recalled that when he returned home from his trip, he suddenly had a new network of friends that spanned across the country. The Harvard Hillel program alumni find themselves lucky to have their newfound friends and community right on campus. “When they get back,” Pressberg said, “the community is still there. ... These birthright groups that come back and serve as their own Jewish communities as well and as an extension of Hillel which is really special.”Kamerow attests to this by recalling that prior to going on Birthright, her involvement with Hillel was non-existent, but that she did become more involved once she returned. Poliak agreed, noting that he now has monthly reunions with friends from the trip.SHOW ME THE SHEKELSBecause Taglit-Birthright is funded in large part by individual philanthropists, as well as the Israeli government and many local Jewish communities, many of the organization’s supporters were worried that the current downward economy would affect the program’s existence.A spokesperson for Taglit Birthright explained that while the economy has impacted the program’s funding, the organization is taking precautions to ensure its future by launching a new fund raising campaign. “The frustrating news,” said the spokesperson, “is that there are fewer resources.”Despite the decrease in resources, the 60th anniversary of Israeli independence in last year caused a massive increase in funding and therefore number of participants on the trip. Despite the changing economy, the number of program participants has steadily increased since the organization was founded. Considering that there is currently a wait list for applicants, it seems like the trip’s popularity and support grows each year. Because the Harvard Hillel program’s funding is separate from the University, it has not been impacted by the decrease in Harvard’s endowment.ISRAEL, MY NEW FRIENDAccording to the Taglit-Birthright spokesperson, the trip attracts applicants “from every walk of Jewish life.” Many of the participants are young Jewish people who have had minimal exposure to religion and Israeli education. Because of this, many of the participants find a new, deeper connection to Israel and their Jewish identities which they might not have known existed before.“I think that Birthright made clear to me that I did want to spend time working on my Jewish identity and expand my views,” said Kamerow. Poliak agreed, emphasizing that even a year after his trip, he is still impacted daily by what he learned and saw in Israel. As he put it, the trip did not just enable him to build relationships within the Jewish community, but also was “the beginning of a relationship with Israel.”

A Crimson investigation has connected ViddyHo.com—the site responsible for an instant messaging worm that spread Tuesday—to an online account belonging to San Francisco man Hoan Ton-That.
The worm struck many Harvard students who received messages on Google Talk, Google’s instant messaging client, directing them to click on a link that led via TinyURL.com to ViddyHo.com. 
ViddyHo.com asked visitors to log into their Google Talk accounts. The site used the log-in information to perpetuate the worm by sending replicas of the original message to the users’ contact lists.
An archived copy of the registration information for ViddyHo.com lists Cam-Hoan Ton-That of San Francisco and HappyAppy Inc. as the registrant.
The site Venture Hacks lists Hoan Ton-That as the sole member of HappyAppy Inc, a relationship that was confirmed by Hoan’s lawyer, Andre Gharakhanian of Silicon Legal Strategy.
Gharakhanian said he was aware of the ViddyHo.com worm because of a post on the tech gossip blog ValleyWag but said that, to his knowledge, Ton-That was not involved.
ViddyHo.com was inaccessible after 7:50 p.m. Tuesday night, and a representative of Afraid.org, a site involved in the hosting of ViddyHo.com, confirmed that the site’s account was suspended for violating Afraid.org’s terms of service. 
Hoan had not returned repeated requests for comment Tuesday night.
The Crimson reported late Tuesday on a less direct connection between Ton-That and the worm.

Last night, there was an unfamiliar sight at the Harvard Women’s Center; a group dominated by men had gathered to attend the event “Defining ‘The Harvard Man’”The diverse crowd, which included athletes, bookworms and recent alums came together to watch clips from Legally Blond, Love Story and The Great Debater and discuss the nature of the “Harvard Man.”The event, which is the first that the Harvard Women’s Center has hosted which focuses on men, is part of the Women’s Center’s campaign to extend its discussion of gender issues to form a broader perspective, said Susan Yao ’09, one of the event planners. “It’s important for us to explicitly be open to all genders,” she added. The clips and the discussion were intended to portray a selection of stereotypes commonly associated with Harvard men: from smooth talkers to anti-social geniuses to wealthy legacies whose last names appear on buildings across campus.The discussion centered around the stereotypes and expectations of the Harvard man, and threw up several hotly debated issues, as students discussed what it meant to be a Harvard man and what defined his success. Some students said they thought that a successful Harvard man was one with membership at one of the eight different Final Clubs, who plays rugby and wears polo shirts with popped collars. Others said they disagreed, responding that success comes from involvement in extracurricular activities, sheer intelligence and well-honed networking skills. The difference between Harvard men versus Harvard women was also addressed. One student said that she had noticed the difference when a man dropped the “H Bomb” versus when a woman did, saying that the casual drop of the H-bomb is a golden ticket for the Harvard men, while a gross turn-off if mentioned by women. Other students were keen to debate the issue further.Jarell L. Lee ’10, said he had enjoyed the event and that it had helped him to gain a new perspective on the issue of the masculinity. “When I was high school, I had to be a man and I think tonight definitely helped me figure out what type of person I want to be,” he said.       When asked if he will be a regular at the Women’s Center, Jarell responded “I’m not the type to hang out at lots of places, but I will definitely try to come here.”

An assistant professor at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences won a National Science Foundation award and over $200,000 for her teaching and research into how fungi can clean up mining sites, SEAS announced Monday.Colleen M. Hansel, a specialist in environmental microbiology, will receive $212,000 over the next two years and up to $537,000 over the next five years through the foundation’s Faculty Early Career Development award, she said in an interview yesterday.The award is given annually by the foundation to faculty in the sciences who haven’t yet achieved tenure but show promise in both their teaching and research.Hansel said the award was particularly welcome given current economic conditions, which have made it extremely difficult to obtain funding.Her research focuses on harnessing fungi’s ability to remove harmful substances produced by mining sites. In particular, Hansel said that many mining sites have toxic concentrations of manganese, and that fungi are able to transform the metal into an inert form. Hansel said she plans to use the grant to expand her research by adding a new project—along with post-doctoral researcher Cara M. Santelli—to study the process by which fungi can break down other potentially harmful substances.The grant also requires that winners use part of their award to provide information and education to the greater community.“The other part of the grant will be to develop a workshop to teach high school teachers and students about acid mine drainage,” Hansel said.  Hansel said she would also use part of the grant to support undergraduate researchers in her lab over the next five summers.

Foodies wondering what was going to fill the space of their beloved Craigie Street Bistrot finally have their answer.A new restaurant, Ten Tables, which aspires to replicate the “dinner party in someone’s home” atmosphere of its original Jamaica Plain incarnation, opened its Cambridge location on Monday night.After about a year of planning for a new branch, co-owner Krista Kranyak settled on the former space of Craigie Street Bistrot, tucked off Garden St and a quick walk from the Quad.“I just sort of had a vision,” Kranyak said. “I love this neighborhood.”Craigie Street Bistrot traded in its name for Craigie on Main, and moved to Central Square in November of last year. The restaurant—which replaced Italian restaurant La Groceria—wanted a larger space and an expanded menu.The Cambridge branch of Ten Tables has also expanded, trading in the literal ten tables of the seven-year-old Jamaica Plain location for twenty. The menu, with its European-inspired cuisine, has similarly grown from five entrees to seven, and the wine list has doubled in length.Partly to save money, partly because they did not realize the enormity of the task, Kranyak, along with her chef and sous-chef, renovated the new Cambridge space themselves. Kranyak said the former occupant’s seven year legacy included a lot of “wear and tear.”“For seven days a week, twelve hours a day, we ripped up the floors, painted the walls, we put in new ceilings,” she said of the renovations, which have left her mostly sleepless for the past week. “My hands are still killing me.”While the new space is larger and lacks the open kitchen of the Jamaica Plain location, Kranyak aims to keep the experience intimate and personalized, with “the same sort of romantic setting” as the original.Nico Herregodts, the general manager of Ten Tables, said he switched from Boston’s famous L’Espalier because he wanted to work in a smaller restaurant. “L’Espalier was a family business when I started in 2000, now it’s really growing,” he said. “I like more the little places.”Herregodts orchestrated the finer details of the new location, including the choice of bread and table setup. Opening night went off without a hitch. Regulars of the Jamaica Plain location came, along with new diners.“I had been doing construction. I was sort of out of my element,” Kranyak said. “When I opened, it was like, this was what I’ve been doing for 20 years.”—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

Students who regularly travel to the west coast received more options for travel when Virgin America began service at Boston Logan International Airport on Feb. 11.Virgin is offering two round-trip flights daily to San Francisco International Airport and three to Los Angeles International Airport starting at $109 one way, according to the company’s Feb. 11 press release.Kacie M. Rounds ‘11, who often uses United Airlines from Logan to both San Francisco and Los Angeles, said she might use Virgin America’s new service in the future.“It should be cheaper than United,” she said.The San-Francisco-based company decided to start flying out of Boston because “it is a top destination from the San Francisco Bay Area and also LAX” said Patricia Condon, a spokeswoman for Virgin America.For the airline’s maiden flight from San Francisco to Boston, Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals—in drag as usual–welcomed the travelers on arrival.The Pudding’s plan was to give their signature kiss to Richard Branson, the founder and president of Virgin, during the press conference about the new flights to Boston, said Pudding member Joshua E. Lachter ’09. But the day before the press conference was to take place, Branson heard about the Pudding’s plan and he wanted to be in on it.“To everyone’s surprise he came out in drag,” Lachter said.Virgin America President and CEO C. David Cush was also present at the launch, though not in drag.Hasty Pudding ended up involved with the event due to the timing of the launch and the Pudding’s Woman of the Year Parade. According to Lachter, Virgin America approached the Pudding about being in the Woman of the Year Parade, which began a larger partnership between the two groups.Hasty Pudding’s members Christopher R. Schleicher ‘09 and David J. Smolinsky ‘11 were also present for the event, according to Pudding spokeswoman Talisa B. Friedman ’10.“We were absolutely thrilled to have Hasty Pudding’s participation in our press conference upon the arrival of the inaugural flight,” said Condon.The new flights come the same month as Southwest Airlines announced their intent to begin service out of Logan next fall.The San Francisco based airline was launched in 2007 and currently services seven cities with its fleet of Airbus A320 Aircraft.

When Harvard College raises its tuition, it is usually to stay on pace with the inflation rate. But while the inflation rate for this past year is only 0.1 percent, and fear of deflation looms, Harvard is raising its tuition by 3.5 percent, responding to greater demand for financial aid in addition to compensating for the plummeting endowment.
But the tuition hike will not translate into an actual increase in the amount of spending money available for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from tuition. Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith said that the FAS is trying to keep the net dollars raised from tuition flat, as financial need increases.
The projected amount spent on financial aid next year is set to increase by 18 percent—surpassing the Financial Aid Office’s expectations, according to Sally C. Donahue, director of the Financial Aid Office.
Seventy-eight percent of Harvard applicants this year applied for financial aid—a seven percent increase from last year. Almost 60 percent of the student population currently receives some need-based aid, according to William R. Fitzsimmons, who is Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid. 
Fitzsimmons said that the projected increase in financial aid output is due not only to Harvard’s recent expansion of financial aid, but also to greater need from students whose families have been affected by the financial crisis.
Harvard’s recent recruitment efforts in lower-income areas across the country have also yielded a greater number of applicants who need financial aid. But Donahue said that the admissions office is now planning to cut back on these trips to slash costs.
Despite the current financial situation, Faculty Dean Smith and University President Drew G. Faust have pledged to maintain their commitment to financial aid.
Tuition, currently FAS’s second largest source of revenue, providing 20 percent of its income, will come to account for a greater percentage of a reduced budget, as the endowment and alumni donations plunge. 
As a result, it is likely that unrestricted funds—of which tuition is a major component—will make up a larger percentage of FAS’s overall budget.
Smith will need to spend the new unrestricted funds making up the difference between a weaker endowment and heightened demand for financial aid.
According to Donahue, tuition will soon account for a larger share of funding for financial aid. Although 70 to 75 percent of financial aid funds are currently drawn from the endowment, that percentage is likely to decrease, Donahue said.
Financial aid officers at Harvard said that they are not concerned that the $1,653 increase in tuition may affect applicants’ decisions to come to Harvard.
“We make the basic assumption that education is right up there as a priority [for families],” Donahue said. 
Harvard’s peer institutions are making similar plans to raise tuition fees, but as little as possible.
“There is a lot of concern about the rising cost of education, and especially at Yale, our goal this year was to keep the rise in tuition, room, and board as low as possible,” said Caesar T. Storlazzi, Yale’s Director of Financial Aid.
Storlazzi added that a relatively flat tuition would act like financial aid for all students at Yale. 
Colleges like Stanford, Princeton, and Brown have maintained their tuition hike at around three percent, reluctant to raise tuition beyond that threshold,
Princeton, whose financial aid output is expected to increase by 13 percent, will raise its tuition by 2.9 percent next year.
“The reason we kept tuition so low is because we know even our families who don’t qualify for financial aid are experiencing the downturn, and we wanted to recognize that,” said Robin A. Moscato, Princeton’s Director of Undergraduate Financial Aid.
Although the tuition hike may seem daunting for some families, it is unlikely to deter eager applicants from coming to Harvard if accepted.
“My parents are enthusiastic about Harvard,” said Chi S. Song, a high school senior from Troy, Mich., who applied to Harvard. “I can’t imagine maybe $500 making a difference.”

Many lovers of Google Talk—a commonly used instant messaging client and procrastination method for students—received an unwelcome surprise yesterday as they were bombarded with messages propagated by an internet worm. The messages directed users to ViddyHo.com—which asked visitors to provide login information for their Google Talk accounts—through a                                	TinyURL.com link. The worm then used that information to send replicas of the message to contacts listed on the newly-infected user’s Google Talk account.ViddyHo.com has been linked to Hoan Ton-That of San Francisco through online registration information for the site.TinyURL.com allows users to give a long Web site link a short alias, which can help hide the link’s true destination. “I feel really dumb for doing it,” said Sarah H. Arshad ’09, who entered her user name and password only to see a random, nonsensical video appear on her screen. “I mean, it’s funny because I instinctively felt I shouldn’t be doing it, but I clearly did it anyway. I should know better by now,” Arshad said. “It’s never happened [to me] before, but it’s common sense not to put your password and login on a site that’s not Gmail.” Nicholas A. Smith ’09—who received the worm’s message from Arshad—said he clicked the link and entered his login information without thinking because she often sends him video links and because the site looked “legit.” But he quickly grew suspicious after 20 or 30 seconds.“It started seeming a little fishy because it was taking a long time to load, and I started to ask myself, ‘What site is this anyway?’” Smith said. He said that the worms’ victims can rectify the issue by clearing their browser cookies, changing their Gmail passwords, and restarting their browsers. ViddyHo.com also appears to have been taken offline. The inconvenience came on the same day that side effects from Google’s routine technical maintenance work left millions of Gmail users without service for over two hours. This was the worst outage to date for Gmail, which serves 113 million users worldwide, according to the Financial Times.Joshua A. Kroll ’09, former president of the Harvard Computer Society, said users should take care not to click on unfamiliar links. He also said that TinyURL.com includes a preview feature that can give Web surfers an indication of the link’s actual destination.—Staff Writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

Like most members of the Harvard senior class, Michael Fucito is currently trying to get a job for next year. But instead of interviews with recruiters, his audition involves playing soccer in Argentina. His potential employers: not Google or Goldman Sachs, but rather, the Seattle Sounders—a Major League Soccer expansion team.Yesterday, Fucito flew to Buenos Aires with the hopes of impressing the MLS club enough over the nine-day training trip to receive a contract.Seattle drafted the Westford, Mass. native with their first selection of the fourth round of the MLS SuperDraft (46th overall) on January 15. Fucito became the fourth Crimson player chosen since the MLS draft’s inception in 1996. He was one of two Ivy League players drafted.Being drafted was no surprise for Fucito, who was named to the NSCAA/Adidas All-America second team for the second year in a row. The striker’s 32 goals and 24 assists put him in fourth in both categories on the Crimson’s all-time list.And accolades came almost as often as the goals during his Harvard career. Fucito was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2004 for his performance in his freshman season. After missing the 2005 season, Fucito gathered All-Ivy first team honors in all three of the following years. His junior and senior seasons, he was named to the Academic All-Ivy League team. His final season in a Crimson uniform also saw him named a finalist for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award.Even with this impressive resume, Fucito’s draft position was likely hurt by the fact that he had been unable to participate in the MLS Player Combine just a few days before due to injury.Fucito could be forgiven had he been slightly disappointed after falling in the draft and then getting selected by an expansion team based across the country.But Fucito seems to be embracing the idea of playing in Seattle.“It was definitely a little off the radar for him,” senior midfielder John Stamatis says. “But I think going at all in the draft is a very big deal. You’ve clearly shown something to someone.”Not only was Fucito’s dream of being drafted realized, but the fact that he was selected by an expansion team could increase his chances of making the team’s roster and receiving a contract.“More and more I’ve been finding things out about Seattle, and I’ve gotten more and more excited,” he says. “I think it gives me an opportunity to come in and make an immediate impact.”It probably doesn’t hurt knowing that he could be taking shooting drills on American goalkeeping legend Kasey Keller or participating in position drills alongside Swedish great Freddie Ljungberg. The two international stars have played for English giants Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, respectively, and each player has captained his country.“It’s very cool to wear the same uniform and share a locker room with guys like that,” Fucito says. “The whole experience for me has been amazing.”Fucito flew out to Washington last week and has spent the last few days with the team. However, the hamstring tear that kept him out of the combine has also kept him off the field so far. He now hopes to be cleared to play in the three exhibition games that the Sounders have scheduled in Buenos Aires.Unfortunately for the senior, staying healthy has always been a problem. Despite the enormous impact he did have, injuries plagued his collegiate career.“The kid was two-time second team All-American when never really healthy,” laughs junior Andre Akpan, Harvard’s new co-captain. “Now he’s finally getting his chance and I think he can do a lot of damage.”Perhaps nobody knows what Fucito brings to the table better than his striking partner. The two forwards were named the “Most Exciting Combination” in Division I Men’s Soccer by College Soccer News, and Akpan attributes much of the team’s success to Fucito. “He’s got two things that are tough to find,” Akpan notes. “He’s left-footed and he’s extremely fast.”Fucito was employed in a variety of positions playing for Harvard, and his versatility could prove a very useful asset for the Sounders. Fucito can certainly play up front—either on his own or just behind a target man like Akpan—and his incredible speed also allows him to be very effective on the left wing.“He is one of the best guys I’ve seen in one-one-one situations with defenders,” Stamatis says. “He really turns his speed into production.”With his natural skills apparent to all, the only question is whether Fucito can stay on the field. But Stamatis notes one other trait that he feels will carry Fucito to professional success and help him to overcome any adversity he might face.“He is a very driven kid,” Stamatis says. “The surgery he had April was supposed to keep him out for five to six months, but he was back playing in the summer after only three.”“It’s going to come down to if I am fit,” Fucito says. “If I’m healthy I think I do belong here. They drafted me for a reason, so now it’s just down to me performing in Argentina.”—Staff writer Jay M. Cohen can be reached at jaycohen@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard women’s swimming and diving looks to make a splash tomorrow in East Meadow, N.Y. at the three-day Ivy League Championships. The Crimson (6-1, 6-1 Ivy) has been cruising through its season, losing only one meet to the reigning three-time Ivy League champion Princeton Tigers (7-0, 7-0). When Harvard faced the Tigers earlier this month, Princeton escaped by a narrow 22-point margin, and this weekend the Crimson is looking for revenge. Harvard is in an eerily familiar position heading into the weekend’s meet. Last year’s squad was also 6-1 in dual meets and also faced Princeton as its top competition. The Crimson barely fell to the Tigers in 2008, amassing 1494 points to Princeton’s 1651.5. The Tigers were crowned champion of the Ancient Eight for the third year running.“[The team] feels pretty good [going into the weekend].” Harvard coach Stephanie Morawski said. “Princeton is the returning champions and we are the underdogs. Everyone is looking to have some fun, and that’s what it is really all about: having fun and getting out there racing.” Winning the Ivy League is a definite possibility for this well-rounded and talented Crimson squad. Two NCAA Championship qualifiers—junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke and sophomore Kate Mills—and six athletes who combined to earn All-Ivy honors in eight events have all returned from last year, and have risen to the challenge to lead this young team in the pool. Clarke, who last year reset her own school record in the 1,000-yard freestyle and placed 21st in the 1,650-yard freestyle at the NCAA Championships, was second to All-American Tiger Alicia Aemisegger in both events at Ivies last year. Mills placed in the top four in three events at the Ivy meet in 2008 and now owns five individual school records.“We have strengths across the board and no particular weakness,” co-captain Kelly Mooney said. “From sprints to middle distance to distance, we have very strong competitors. I am looking forward to the distance swimmers starting us off strong.”What makes the Harvard squad so unique is that there is no kink in the chain. The team has been consistently strong in all of its meets throughout the entire season. At the Harvard-Yale-Princeton double-dual meet, the Crimson demonstrated its enormous depth, earning a top-two sweep of the 200-yard backstroke, 100-yard butterfly, and most notably, the 400-yard freestyle relay. Sophomores Katy Hinkle, Laura Murray, and Kate Mills and freshman Alicia Lightbourne dominated the relay, finishing nearly four seconds ahead of their teammates in 3:24.89. Close behind, rookies Monica Burgos and Margaret Fish and sophomores Ali Slack and Holly Furman took second, capping the most impressive win for Harvard. Hinkle is the defending Ivy champion in the 50-yard freestlye, winning the race in 23.18 seconds last year.The young swimmers have contributed greatly to the success of the Crimson, posting up big wins and strong performances. Alongside the leadership of Mooney and Clarke, the rookies have set a new tone.Freshman Meghan Leddy has already made a name for herself, setting a school record in the 200-yard backstroke in December and winning that event at HYP.“It is an entirely different team [this year],” Mooney said, “and it has an entirely different feel with the new freshman class.”Due to the immense depth of Harvard’s squad, every event has a talented individual who has a good chance at placing in the top eight, which is crucial to winning the Ivy championship. A team can accumulate points by placing anywhere in the top 24, but earning a spot in the eight-swimmer A final guarantees the team at least 22 points. In dual meets, only the top five places score.“That’s our goal, honestly.” Morawski said. “If they can get in the top eight, then we have a really good chance at winning the meet.”Throughout its meets all season, the Crimson has demonstrated its ability to place well in competition. With strong leadership and young talent, it looks as if the Ivy title is inching closer to the hands of the Harvard underdog.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To say that Harvard lacrosse surrounded Jeff Cohen growing up would be an understatement. His older brothers Steve Cohen ’06 and Greg Cohen ’07 played lacrosse for the Crimson and, in their final year together in 2006, led Harvard to its first playoff appearance since 1996. Then, when Jeff started gaining recognition as one of Long Island’s best high school lacrosse players, he had his eyes on the all-time Long Island scoring record of 236 goals shared by Crimson players Max Motschwiller ’09 and Dean Gibbons ’11. Two U.S. Lacrosse All-American Awards and 260 career goals later, Jeff Cohen had set the bar high before stepping foot on campus. So, it shouldn’t have come as a surprise when Cohen led all scorers with a hat trick and threw in an assist during Harvard’s 9-6 upset win at then-No. 5 Duke on Sunday, earning him Ivy League Rookie of the Week as well as Turfer/New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (NEILA) Co-Player of the Week honors. Although he is ranked as the No. 4 incoming freshman in his class by Inside Lacrosse, Crimson coach John Tillman praised Cohen for his humility and not letting his great success impede his mindset or adjustment to the college game. “Coming into Division I lacrosse from high school takes a long time to adjust to how fast the pace is—how well-conditioned you have to be, how strong you have to be,” Tillman said. “We really challenged Jeff in the fall, and it was not easy for him…He fought through it, hung in there, and I’m really proud of him for that.” Cohen started playing lacrosse around age five on Long Island, NY. He credits his brothers with introducing him to the game and inspiring him to achieve success. “They definitely got me into it. I was always watching their games from the sideline, and as a younger brother, they are your heroes,” Cohen said. “You always want to fill their shoes, and they had such a huge impact on and off the field”.Cohen followed his brothers’ example while lettering at Syosset High School. In addition to breaking the all-time Long Island scoring record, he tallied 85 career assists. He led Syosset to the 2008 Long Island Championship as well as two Nassau County Class A Championships, earning Offensive MVP of the competition in both years. When it came time to decide where he would ply his trade next, Harvard was the clear front-runner.“I looked at Princeton and at some of the other Ivies, but Harvard was always where I wanted to be,” Cohen said. “After coming up here to see my brothers play so often and hanging around the campus, I was really comfortable with the environment here.” In his first game for the Crimson, Cohen got a chance to contribute after sophomore Dean Gibbons fell ill.“When Dean came down with pneumonia, we knew were going to have a step up,” Cohen said. “We were shorthanded, and our game plan was to not have one player do too much and work together as a team.” Tillman reiterated Cohen’s ability to succeed within a Harvard lacrosse team whose style of play favors a balanced attack with little superstar action. “Without Dean, somebody needed to step up,” Tillman said. “No one needed to carry the load, but we needed some guys to make plays throughout the game.”“I thought Jeff showed a lot of poise, maturity, and leadership,” Tillman added. He wasn’t trying to do too much, but he was taking what the defense gave him.” Tillman has also noticed the impact that growing up in a lacrosse family has had on Cohen.“He’s had a lot of experience and has terrific instincts,” Tillman said. “He really understands the game well, has good skills, and is a very quick learner.” When asked how he would find ways to succeed after setting the bar high so early, Cohen again displayed his modesty and commitment to the team.“No one really worries about who’s doing the scoring,” he said. “We just try to put ourselves in situations every day in practice that make us the most successful team during the game.”While Cohen may not be watching his own stats as closely, the freshman phenom has attracted the attention of many who will be excited to see what he offers next.

Maybe it was the social death sentence implicit in the blurbs that billed him as a “Freshman Phenom,” but only six people (counting me, the girl who was working at the Pent House café, and the person who promoted this Acoustic Tuesday over house lists) trickled in to the top floor of the SOCH to listen to Pete Davies' solo guitar act.
Davies was actually quite good. He exuded a recognizably freshman earnestness into each clever word of his original songs about complicated romantic situations.  I particularly liked his song about resurrected love, as a woman reunites with the man who joined the clergy when she spurned him 27 years ago. His “Autobiography of a Bum” was cool too.  For the first fifteen minutes of the performance I imagined I was in the 1940's, a girl with her ear pressed against a radio, tuned to bluegrass.  After the last few spectators wandered in, he had us go around and say our names.
But whose idea was it to have concerts in the middle of the week in the Quad?  What I love about the Pent House is exactly why it’s a terrible venue for anything that’s supposed to have attendees–it’s almost always deserted.
Poor Davies. He never had a chance.

The student group formerly known as Harvard-Radcliffe Television has finally decided to change it's name to reflect the demise of Radcliffe College. Only a decade late!
But more amusingly, the newly christened Harvard Undergraduate Television's original pick may have been scuttled by Associate Dean Judith H. Kidd's Office of Student Activities, or so suggests an e-mail from the group's fearless leader Derek Flanzraich '10.
Why was Kidd's gang hating on the name Harvard Television Network (HTVN, obviously)? Read on for Flanzraich vaguely illuminating explanation of the "small squabble" that caused his club to "forget" its chosen name.
From: Derek Flanzraich
Date: Wed, 25 Feb 2009 17:57:14 -0500
Subject: [HUTV] Welcome to the HUTV List?!
Yup. After a small squabble over naming with the Office of Student
Activities, we've decided to forget Harvard Television Network (HTVN) and,
instead, go with Harvard Undergraduate Television (HUTV). We're excited
about our new name-- and excited to share all of the many initiatives we're
embarking on as we get closer and closer to the official HUTV launch. And
we'll still remain a "Network," one of which all of you are a part of.
So, long story short, stay tuned for more information. And, for now, we're
going to be shifting to HUTV as our primary name and list-- so welcome
(again).
Thanks!

Breaking news: Harvard figured out that feeding chubby people doughnuts won’t help them lose weight.
We always thought that eating fewer calories would lead to weight loss.  Well, after two years, an 811 person study, and who knows how much money (cough, financial crisis, cough), Harvard’s setting the record straight.
The study asked its participants—who were each assigned to a diet that emphasized either proteins, carbohydrates, or fat—to cut their calorie intake by 750 calories a day and were asked to exercise each week.  Regardless of which diet they were on, all participants lost weight. Wow.
Feeling kind of doubtful, The Crimson decided to do its own study (we guarantee ours is much more cost-efficient).  After two minutes, 119,000 Google results, and zero dollars (if you don’t include the coffee that we’re drinking to curb our pangs of hunger), we stumbled upon the exact same answer.
"We all pretty much know that in order to weigh less, we need to eat less.  It seems like I have known this forever," http://willtaft.com/health/how-to-eat-less-to-weigh-less/ July 2007
We're pretty confident at the outset that there is no such secret. We're just going to show you a weight loss method that won't be easy, but that will work if you do it right. Just so you don't think we're being mysterious, here's the method: eat less and exercise. Surprised?
http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/loseweight/loseweight.html
Now we’re convinced.
