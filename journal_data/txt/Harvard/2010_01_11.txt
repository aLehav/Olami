After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a groundbreaking feat of computation, a team of international scientists—including Harvard researchers—have calculated the precise energy of a hydrogen molecule using a quantum computer.
While scientists have been able to determine the energy of hydrogen using paper and pencil since the 1930s, they now know they can use a quantum computer to perform this—and hopefully more complex calculations—with precision.  Using classical computers, calculating the energies of larger molecules was virtually unimaginable because “the numbers get literally astronomical,” according to University of Queensland Physics Professor Andrew G. White, one of the authors of the study published in “Nature Chemistry” on Jan. 10.
“A classical computer trying to do an exact simulation of a complex process would just blow up,” White said.
Unlike classical computers, quantum computers can account for an exponential number of possibilities when looking at a single piece of information.
Chemical calculations that would take massive amounts of time and rely heavily on approximation with classical computers can therefore be more feasibly—and precisely—performed with quantum computers, explained Alàn Aspuru-Guzik, an assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard and another author of the study.
“Approximate calculations are everywhere, and they take you very far, you can simulate very large systems, but they usually fail somewhere,” Aspuru-Guzik said.
He added that this recent quantum triumph is exciting because it opens the opens the door to bigger and better quantum computation.
“There might be roadblocks, but you don’t have to worry about errors,” Aspuru-Guzik said of the precision of quantum computing. “You can do calculations about things in the human body, without worrying about mistakes—that’s the dream.”
The researchers hope that their project will help generate interest in research that connects chemistry and quantum computing.
“Cool science happens at the interfaces of different fields,” Aspuru-Guzik said.
This experiment was designed in Cambridge but realized in Australia.  The software designed by Aspuru-Guzik and his team was implemented using quantum computers at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
“We sat down with them—over e-mail—and talked back and forth on Skype about how best to lay out the quantum and chemical systems,” Harvard graduate student James D. Whitfield said of bringing the software and hardware together.
“It was almost as if they were down the hall,” added fellow graduate student Ivan Kassal.
The quantum computer in Brisbane takes up two square meters, and the researchers felt an “interesting parallel” between this moment and the early days of classical computers, Kassal said. Performing innovative calculations on such a large piece of machinery made them feel like the scientists of 60 years ago, who were using computers to crack codes or fire artillery in ground-breaking ways.
None of those World War II scientists could imagine their work someday leading to the wonders of Skype or iPhones, White added.
“The reason that computers are developed is never the reason they end up getting used,” he said.
Aspuru-Guzik and White agree that, as with the work done by the scientists of the past, the full implications of their research have not yet been revealed.
“In far less than 50 years, this will change the world,” White said.  “How, I have no idea.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the eighth consecutive year, Harvard women’s swimming defeated Penn (2-3, 2-3 Ivy). The Crimson (4-0, 4-0) won all 13 contested events on its way to a 195-80 victory in Sheerr Pool in Philadelphia, not including scores from the diving events that took place in Princeton as part of the Princeton Diving Invitational.
The early January meet fell in the middle of the team’s peak training, so coach Stephanie Morawski wanted to see her team’s full potential.
“The goal was to put people in their best events and see what they can do,” Morawski said. “They raced hard. They executed a really good race plan. They surprised themselves by how well they did.”
The swimmers also were happy with their effort.
“I think we all did such a great job,” junior Kate Mills. “We all raced really hard and it was really impressive to watch. We came together a lot as a team and it shows when you see the results.”
“We had good enthusiasm and that translated into our good performance,” junior Ali Slack said.
The Crimson opened the dual meet with a 1-2 finish in the 200-yard medley relay. Junior Katy Hinkle, freshman Mackenzie Luick, freshman Kelly Robinson, and junior Ali Slack took the top spot.
“The first race really motivates everyone for the meet,” Morawski said. “It got us off on the right foot. Both [Harvard relay] teams were very good.”
Harvard kept its momentum with two more 1-2 finishes in the next two races. Junior Christine Kaufmann persevered to take the 1000-yard freestyle and junior Katherine Pickard finished atop the 200 free standings.
Harvard swept the top three spots in six events. Hinkle won the 100-yard backstroke against Penn for the third consecutive year, improving upon her winning time from last year’s meet by over a second. Robinson sprinted to take the 50 free, sophomore Meghan Leddy topped the 200-yard backstroke standings, sophomore Helen Pitchik touched first in the 200-yard breaststroke, and Robinson claimed victory in the 100-yard butterfly for her third victory of the day. Finally, junior Kate Mills set a pool record with her 4:54.33 time in the 500 free.
“[Kate] knew that time was doable,” Morawski said. “She got a commanding lead and got stronger as the race went along. She’s been training well so it’s not much of a surprise.”
Mills set another pool record in the 200 fly with a time of 2:00.36, breaking the previous record she set during her freshman year of 2:02.84.
“She was fabulous,” Morawski said. “She had the pool record and wanted to break it. She finished so strong.”
Luick also won the 100-yard breaststroke to accompany her earlier relay victory. Luick’s relay teammate Hinkle won her third event by touching first in the 100 free.
Sophomore Kristi Korsberg placed first in the 200-yard individual medley.
Prior to the meet, the team set a goal as a team to set as many pool records as possible, according to Mills. Robinson, Slack, freshman Camille Hendrix, and Hinkle did their part to fulfill that goal by setting a pool record of 3:30.68 in an exhibition 400-yard freestyle relay, the third pool record of the day.
“Robinson got them off to a great start,” Morawski said. “Katy [Hinkle] loves to race. She knew she would have to be fast if they had a chance at that record.”
“It was a team effort,” Slack said of the relay. “Everyone swam well.”
With the new academic schedule affecting the swim schedule, the meet’s score may have been more one-sided than in past years.
“If we had had another meet in December like in the past,” Morawski said, “then I would not have had my swimmers in their best event and it might have been more competitive.”
Additionally, the new schedule has allowed swimmers to take the month of January to focus on training and a healthy lifestyle without other distractions.
“Without the stress of exams or schoolwork, the team has been able to catch up on sleep,” Morawski said. “This academic schedule could work out for us.”
