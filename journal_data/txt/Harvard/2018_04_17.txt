After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “A Bag of Marbles,” two brothers, Joseph “Jo” Joffo (Dorian Le Clech) and Maurice Joffo (Batyste Fleurial), flee from Paris in the middle of the night to escape Nazi persecution in occupied Vichy, France. The two youngsters make their way from place to place, often only evading capture due to luck or goodwill. The French-language film is a harrowing tale of hatred, separation, and death, like many films about the Holocaust, for example, “Sophie’s Choice” and “Schindler’s List.” However, it adds to our understanding of this human tragedy, speaking powerfully about finding joy and love amid times of great darkness. And, while the movie is based on the autobiography of French Jewish author, Joseph Joffo, the boys’ flight to freedom makes a wider statement of the mentalities of the victims, witnesses, supporters, and humanitarians of this tragedy that scarred the first half of the twentieth century. Ultimately, “A Bag of Marbles” highlights that even in great hardship, one can still find and enjoy times of happiness, love, and lightheartedness, a testament to Jewish resilience during the Holocaust.
Unlike other films of its genre, “A Bag of Marbles” is able to have lighthearted moments by giving its protagonists the advantage of preparation. Joseph and Maurice Joffo only have one advantage, and that is time. Following an order that all French Jews are to wear a yellow star, their parents quickly realize the way the winds are heading and adequately prepare the boys with money, a travel plan, an order to never reveal they are Jewish to anyone, and assurances they will reunite in Nice before sending them off. The boys’ preparation and greater understanding of their situation, which do nothing to minimize the danger of their plight, make for a lighter movie than “Schindler’s List,” “Sophie’s Choice,” and “Life is Beautiful.” The boys luckily have a plan, keeping them one step ahead of the Germans and enabling the film to focus more on brotherly bonding and horseplay. One fond moment is their first steps into the Free Zone, an administrative area under the control of the Nazi-collaborating Vichy regime. After Jo is shot in the foot, Maurice carries his little brother on his back and says, “It’s only natural. You’re my little bro. I’d carry you to the end of the world.” This lasts for about two seconds before Maurice complains about his brother’s weight and puts Jo down, who jokingly replies, “To the end of the world?” After arriving in Nice, being reunited with the family, and being presented with papers, the tale of the brothers isn’t one of hiding or feeling from place to place under the cover of night, but of avoiding detection, allowing them to actually find some joy despite fear.
Director Christian Duguay masterfully uses wavering definitions of image and lighting to show the feelings Jo associates with his memories and to give access to his thoughts while he is constantly threatened.  Throughout the film, positive memories, such as the reunification of the family in Nice and the journey of the two brothers through the Free Zone are depicted in bright lighting and a gloss that serves to make the entire scene shine with a luster, but blurs the usually high definition of the individual figures within it, suggesting impermanence. In contrast, negative memories are stark and well-defined, often in dark yellows and browns. By associating color and scene clarity with Jo’s emotional perceptions, Duguay offers the audience a clear insight into the mind of his protagonist, an established pattern that he later uses to disrupt an initially benign scene during Liberation Day. At first, the scene is brightly lit and glossy. But once a mob enters the home of a staunch Petanist (a Nazi supporter) to harass him and his family, the colors become starker and the lighting darker. Already, Duguay’s filmic language makes an important statement on how violence begets violence and how Jo relates to this revelation.
Jo’s feeling about the Peronist (a supporter of Argentine leader Juan Perón) who had unwittingly hid him from Nazi persecution for some time suggests the film’s larger elucidation of how the war and antisemitism have affected all aspects of French society. For as much as the narrative is centered around Jo and his brother, it is as much about the people they encounter and how these people relate to the Holocaust. The film depicts how coyotes (human smugglers), collaborators, Catholic priests, resistance fighters, and Jews view themselves in the conflict. A trustworthy coyote helps Jo and Maurice along with another fleeing family across the demarcation between German-occupied France and the Free Zone. Despite the coyote’s kindness, he is not exempt from a desire for money—namely 1,000 francs a head. A powerful and complex story works behind each character and his or her motivations, jointly brought to life by good writing and good acting.
This coupled effort manifests in the character of the father, Roman Joffo, whom actor Patrick Bruel embodies excellently. After fleeing from Russian pogroms (organized massacres) to Paris as a child and now having to see his own children flee Paris, Roman has great wisdom and understanding of the recent developments in France but also wishes to spare his family from the culture of fear and demoralization inherent to their escape and the reason behind it. Bruel works with the script to give Roman a certain world-weariness and gravitas. Despite the father’s constant optimism and promises, Bruel highlights the fact that there is always something darker behind his eyes. When Roman must be rough with his children to give them some inkling of the danger they are in, Bruel brilliantly plays simultaneous heartbreak, resulting in some of the most tear-inducing, empathetic moments in the film.
By virtue of the horrific nature of the Holocaust, the film’s setting is provocative enough to induce great emotion as the depths of human barbarity are revealed. “A Bag of Marbles” strives to tell a different story. The situation of Jo and his family allows for good as well as bad memories during years of death and loss. In showing this balance, the film emphasizes the resilience and bravery of Jewish families to find light and laughter against the darkest backdrop. It also tells the stories of others in World War II France and how they relate to the war, giving the audience a greater understanding of French society in a time of great division, war, and horror. Just after crossing the demarcation point and arriving in the French Free Zone, the brothers sleep in a barn, where Jo asks his brother if they are finally “free to be Jewish,” to which his brother replies, “Free to sleep, numbnuts.” This film brings to light what Jo and his family could not at the time: The many manifestations of the Jewish struggle during the Holocaust and their experience with the resistance, their families, and the collaborators.

In director Jeff Wadlow’s “Truth or Dare,” a group of friends on spring break gets pulled into a lethal game of truth or dare. The movie had the potential to turn a juvenile game into something twisted and terrifying; instead, it feels incredibly childish. The stilted acting and shallow relationships, along with the relationship drama that seems equally important to the characters as the threat of death, are reminiscent of a Disney Channel-style horror flick. One scene steps beyond teen drama towards educational children’s television, when a character reads menacingly from a piece of paper, “Demons can possess people, places, even ideas.” I felt transported back to fifth-grade grammar class—demons, it seems, can possess nouns.
The movie makes an effort to hit not just on every classic horror movie trope, but also on every non-horror-related cliché possible, starting with the characters themselves. There is Ronnie (Sam Lerner), the completely clueless misogynist who tags along with the group in hopes of getting laid: He provides comic relief and is obviously introduced to serve as the first kill. There is Tyson (Noland Gerard Funk), the wealthy, perfectly-groomed, overconfident boy with no morals who sells fake prescriptions and only cares about getting into medical school. His perpetually drunk, doting girlfriend Penelope (Sophia Ali), is perhaps the most interesting character, as her alcoholism is at least surprising, but even that remains unexplored. There is Brad (Hayden Szeto), the problem-solving, likeable boy who is not yet out to his policeman father. And then of course, there are the two best friends Olivia (Lucy Hale) and Markie (Violette Beane)—who supposedly mean the world to each other despite constantly fighting—and the quiet, brooding boy they are both in love with, Lucas (Tyler Posey). The clichés unfortunately extend past the characters into the writing and score. It is hard to take a movie seriously when someone unironically says, “We can’t change the past but we can still have a future.” The soundtrack also screams, “This is a horror movie,” loud and off-putting enough to be grating but not at all scary—an unexplained creepy laugh echoes even before the end of the opening credits.
At times, the stereotypes and attempts at drama move beyond the ineffective and toward the actively offensive. For instance, the friends begin their game of truth or dare in Mexico, and the demon associated with the game follows them back to the United States. It is possible, of course, that Mexico was just the natural setting for a spring break trip. But after the fifth slow pan across the green Mexican border sign, the shot begins to seem not just repetitive but also slightly pointed—of course the unfamiliar dark magic, demons, abandoned buildings, and gruesome ancient rituals are from another country.
The script shows a similar lack of sensitivity. In another scene, Olivia is dared to sleep with Lucas, Markie’s boyfriend. The pair’s feelings for each other have been obvious since the beginning of the movie, but they have not acted on them out of concern for Markie. As Lucas begins to passionately kiss Olivia, she stops him, fearing that he is faking his passion, complaining that he has to have sex for the sake of the game. “You have to. I don’t,” he replies, in a response that is somehow framed as romantic. In a scene meant to be the pinnacle of Olivia and Lucas’s relationship, this language unnecessarily and uncomfortably recalls issues of sexual consent. This awkward and inconsiderate writing unfortunately represents a larger trend in the film.
Wadlow cannot quite seem to make up his mind about what sort of horror movie he wants “Truth or Dare” to be. It is not particularly gory, and having the characters’ faces transform into what the movie itself acknowledges looks like “a messed up Snapchat filter” before they die dulls the impact of their deaths. The plot sets the movie up to be a psychological thriller, a seventh-grade game gone wrong, but the inner workings of the characters and the demon are not particularly interesting and the truths and dares laid out not particularly disturbing. The movie could have made good use of comedic horror—making it almost enjoyable to watch, or at least to make fun of, if not for the perpetual references to rape and suicide, which felt unemotional, out of place, and unnecessary, making it instead harder to laugh at the characters without feeling guilty.
The lack of emotion in general is almost impressive. It is quite a feat, for example, to take the emotion out of a scene depicting a son as he is forced to hold his own father at gunpoint. The characters do not grieve at all as one after another of their friends die, and Olivia, the protagonist, barely reacts when her friend literally takes a bullet for her.
The one possible redeeming feature is the concept. The idea of truth or dare—a game that is slightly sadistic even in its relatively innocent seventh-grade iteration—turned deadly and inescapable is certainly interesting. But the plot of the movie gets a little ridiculous as time goes on, and when the demon—in a move that has been annoying seventh-graders for centuries—dares someone to tell the truth, it is hard not to groan. One could also read the film, albeit generously, as a critique on social media, between the main characters’ obsession with various social media platforms, the comparison of their possessed faces to a grotesque Snapchat filter, and the demons occasional communication over social media. But even then its point is unoriginal and the moral does not justify the poor execution. The twist ending is the most compelling part of the movie, equally enjoyable both because it is surprising and because it means that the movie is finally over.

In “About Three Years Later,” the Season Seven premiere of Fox’s “New Girl,” the storyline picks up—unsurprisingly—three years after the end of the previous season’s finale. Nick (Jake Johnson) and Jess (Zooey Deschanel)—still unmarried—have now been together for three years. Schmidt (Max Greenfield) and Cece (Hannah Simone) are married with a baby. Winston (Lamorne Morris) and Aly (Nasim Pedrad) are also married, and Aly is pregnant with their first child. Although in many senses, this season serves as an epilogue for the show, the lack of progress in Nick and Jess’s relationship hinders the otherwise-enjoyable premiere.
Schmidt and Cece’s relationship is heavily featured in the episode. They behave more like a married couple than in previous seasons, showing that they are much more comfortable and confident with each other. Both have matured drastically, as they seem much more in control of their relationship. Schmidt, in particular, seems to have grown up the most. He organizes a feminist-icon-themed birthday party for his daughter Ruth—a huge leap from early seasons, when his character leaned heavily on his immaturity and sexual humor. Schmidt and Cece’s solid relationship is cemented as they rush around their daughter’s birthday party, handing out alcoholic “Ruth Bader Gins-burgs” and “Rosé the Riveters.” Their relationship maintains its hilarity and entertainment while still maturing over the three-year hiatus.
Winston and Aly mirror Schmidt and Cece’s relationship, though to a lesser degree. They seem content and happy with one another, and even as Aly struggles emotionally with her pregnancy, the pair is able to navigate their struggles with honesty. Furthermore, Winston’s unique and endearing sense of humor continues to entertain, and is rather artfully sprinkled throughout the episode.
Most of the episode’s conflict revolves around Jess and Nick: Though they continually mention that they have been in a healthy relationship for the past three years, the validity of this statement is constantly called into question throughout the episode. When asked by Russell, her ex-boyfriend, about their relationship, she lies, telling him that she and Nick are engaged. After Jess has a discussion with Nick about not needing to get married, Nick still tries to propose to her at 4 A.M. They continually fail to communicate with one another, and are unable to be honest with themselves and with each other.
Though they are the main couple of the show and the main source of conflict, their lack of progress is incredibly frustrating, especially when juxtaposed with Winston and Aly’s and Schmidt and Cece’s respective relationships. While all of their friends mature and grow around them, Nick and Jess remain stagnant. With only one season left to go, it seems unlikely that Nick and Jess will finally reach a healthy level of comfort with each other and their relationship until the final few episodes.
Outside of Nick and Jess’s relationship, Nick still struggles to be a mature friend. He finds he doesn’t like Schmidt’s new mustache, and publicly calls him out on it. He continues to be bothered by the mustache’s presence throughout the entire episode, yelling at Schmidt several times. Finally, when Nick angrily admits that he misses the bare-faced Schmidt, Nick yells “Are you happy now?” and slams the door. Schmidt happily responds: “No, Nick, not happy now. Happy forever.” Though Nick fails to act maturely around Schmidt, Schmidt continues to showcase his personal growth and reliability as a friend.
In the season premiere, each character’s distinct and quirky personas remain, providing for a pleasing and enjoyable viewing experience. However, Nick and Jess’s inability to move beyond their relationship difficulties hinders the episode as a whole. As of yet, the show promises to satisfy die-hard fans, but a distanced viewing of the premiere leaves a bit to be desired.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard is a famous concert pianist who has just been diagnosed with ALS. “Every Note Played,” Genova’s fifth book, describes Richard’s life after he moves back home so his ex-wife, Karina, can care for him. The writing style and character development leave much to be desired, but Genova’s career as a neuroscientist and her personal relationships with those who suffer from ALS add detail to the experience of the disease and its effects in both an informative and heartbreaking way.
Genova has a bad habit of ending her chapters with overused or overly dramatic metaphors. The prologue ends as Richard stands to hear his applause at a performance: “He is loved by everyone. And no one.” The second chapter concludes with an extended metaphor comparing Richard to a BMW running low on gas. The narrator posits, “How many miles does he have left?” The list goes on, and these worn out expressions detract from the emotional poignancy the novel’s subject so desperately calls for.
Unfortunately, Genova sprinkles her clichés not just at the end of her chapters, but throughout the novel. “Location matters in destiny as much as it matters in real estate,” which is why Karina claims she’s been miserable for years in Boston, a city that lacks a jazz scene. But Karina thinks she’s strong because “You can take the girl out of Poland, but you can’t take the Poland out of the girl.” These tired lines take the spotlight off of the main plotline and their shoddiness makes any backstory, side plot or minor character development seem cheap and unfulfilling.
Furthermore, Genova refuses to follow the golden rule of writing: Show, don’t tell. Perhaps part of this problem stems from her decision to write in a third-person omniscient perspective: The reader gains access to all the characters’ thoughts, but they are accompanied by “Richard thought,” and “Karina felt.” Character development does not simply evolve throughout the narrative; Geneva walks her readers through several rounds of her characters’ thoughts. For instance, instead of having Richard and Karina apologize for their respective parts in the divorce in a heartfelt scene, Genova dedicates countless paragraphs to Richard explicitly thinking about his regrets and the ways he can apologize. Each beautiful moment is preceded by many agonizing ones in which the characters reiterate their hopes, fears, and regrets. This repetition hampers the effects of the touching scenes, watering down moments that should shine.
But ultimately “Every Note Played” has a purpose. The novel is informative and details the many phases of Richard’s ALS. Genova knows what could and will happen, as well as what sort of medical treatment is necessary for each scenario. She paints a picture of ALS that is eye-opening and honest.Talking is laborious for Richard, and his legs are paralyzed. Many people have a misunderstanding of how fast the paralysis spreads and how long most people with ALS live after they are diagnosed, especially given popular culture’s representation of Stephen Hawking (who recently passed away 55 years after he was diagnosed). He surpassed his physicians expectations by many decades and had access to some of the best equipment available.
But this book reveals a side of ALS that is not often seen. “Every Note Played” depicts the frustrations that accompany a lack of mobility and an inability to communicate efficiently, coupled with the knowledge that the condition will never improve. Richard “studies his hands that will never again look familiar to him, fingers that used to carry exquisite strength and agility, that a year and a half ago played eighty-seven pages of Brahms I without error.”
In terms of artistry, “Every Note Played” falls flat. The character development is lacking and the prose relies on tiresome phrases that don’t flow with the rest of the novel. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a spot on the bookshelf for Genova’s newest novel. When detailing the experience of ALS, Genova’s book aims to generate more awareness and funding for this condition, as stated in the acknowledgements. She does this through her description of Richard’s experience with the disease, which is educated by her knowledge as a neuroscientist and her relationships with people who have been diagnosed with ALS.

As the spring semester slowly tapers to an end, students gather for a much-needed break in the form of Yardfest. Temporarily sectioned away with fences from the rest of the world, the string of performances feels just walled-off enough for attendees to shake away their stresses and exhale—an action far too often neglected by the student body. Unfortunately, though eagerly anticipated, the festival does not always meet expectations. The gradual decline in audience engagement as this year’s Yardfest unfolded is a testament to how difficult it is to traverse the college’s atmosphere through performance.
It’s never a good sign when you feel like the night was front-loaded coming out of a four-hour lineup. The opening acts were the unquestionable highlights of the show. The first group, Disco Band, was a charming throwback. Covering crowd favorites like The Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back,” Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.,” and especially well-received closing cover of Stevie Wonder’s  “Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I’m Yours),” the student performers managed to win over the crowd with established classics and glistening saxophone accompaniment.
If its counterpart was all about the past, vocal powerhouse 21 Colorful Crimson gave a picture of a robust student body looking forward. An outspoken advocate for diversity on campus, 21CC carried through their mission statement through their song selections, showcasing an array of styles including Latin, hip-hop, and pop ballads. Their message, though saccharine, struck a nerve with the audience: The performers received thunderous applause from their peers.
Nestled symbolically in the heart of the New Yard, the student groups brought to the stage a confluence of old and new, retrospective and progressive, which really made it feel like—at least for a couple of hours—that music might effectively assuage the stress-related tensions of the term on campus. The artists that followed them, however, struggled to recreate this effect.
Friday’s performance made palpable the strange, awkward feeling of separation that occurs when artists come to the University. The same playful acknowledgement of setting that flies so well with sold-out arenas manifests itself differently here. Artists engaging a Harvard audience come up harshly against the fourth-wall, inserting themselves into a student body seeking to forget academic life for an evening. Unlike student musicians, headliners lack useful campus context and must actively adapt to their audience with varying levels of success.
Wale’s set generally landed. His bars, crisply delivered, fell on receptive ears and were even echoed back, despite his reputation as a more niche artist. The performance of his new song “Black Bonnie” was intimate and enjoyable. He was able to work the crowd, at one point hoisting a fan holding copies of his albums over the barrier and onto the stage to dance for several songs. These moments of immersion, however, were punctuated by humor, not all of which worked. While a joke about future well-connected lawyers getting his friends out of trouble garnered a smattering of laughter, Wale’s praising of Harvard students for understanding the word “algorithm” uncomfortably brought student focus right back to the college beyond the festival.
Any concerns one might have had with Wale, though, were even worse with the final act and supposed crown jewel of the night. Lil Yachty was, by all accounts, resoundingly disappointing. Unlike those who came before him, he was unable to convincingly make the steps of Memorial Church his own, and even the most recognizable pieces of his discography—“Broccoli,” “iSpy,” and “Minnesota”—were tepid. Worst of all, however, was his inability to read the crowd. Misdirecting his charisma towards unsuccessfully urging the student body over and over to form mosh pits (which he was later told, quite fittingly, that he could not say due to liability), Yachty squandered valuable time when he could have let his music speak for him instead.
It’s a funny thing, being right up against a festival barricade. It’s up there where performers decide, deliberately or not, how they will contend with their audiences. The successful acts this Yardfest were able to reach across this divide, pulling listeners out of campus at least for a few hours. Others, however, were unable to surmount this wall, failing to provide the perennial musical performance as retreat which students so desperately covet.

Several students eligible to vote tomorrow and Thursday on the unionization effort proposed by Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers have expressed discontent at the election’s lack of mail-in ballots. Students are limited to three in-person ballot stations scattered across campus, which they argue restricts their ability to participate in what could be a crucial vote. While the relative scarcity of voting stations is unfortunate, it is unavoidable at this juncture due to an existing agreement between HGSU-UAW and the University. Nevertheless, students’ concern underscores a broadly applicable point about the importance of the election itself.
The University and HGSU-UAW reached an agreement in Oct. 2016 to hold an election under the National Labor Relations Board’s most common procedure on the issue—one without mail-in ballots. This decision occurred before the first unionization election, and this agreement will persist for this week’s revote. On one level, any reduction of the electorate is regrettable, and this policy may render off-campus students unable to vote. However, the in-person nature of the election has been public knowledge for over a year, and the NLRB does not permit absentee ballots in these elections. This procedural reality does not necessitate change at this point in time or call into question whatever outcome results from the election.
Off-campus students’ disappointment at not being able to vote, and the lengths to which some are going to participate in the election in person, speak to a larger issue: the importance of the election itself. All eligible, available students should feel that it is then necessary for them to participate in this vote.
As undergraduates who are not eligible to vote in the election and who would thus not be represented by the proposed union, we have not felt it our place to either endorse or condemn HGSU-UAW’s unionization effort, though we have strongly supported students’ right to unionize if they so choose.
In that vein, the upcoming vote is of paramount importance to the lives of students who teach and research at Harvard now and for the foreseeable future. The direction of this vote on unionization will help define the relationship between the faculty members and administrators who direct the University’s research and teaching on a broad scale and the graduate students who are essential parts of that work. In light of this issue’s magnitude, both advocates for and critics of the unionization effort have made compelling arguments with which eligible voters should familiarize themselves.
Advocates for unionization point to a variety of benefits that they believe HGSU-UAW provides. They highlight the potential bargaining power that the union would bring towards fairer wages and more effective handling of sexual misconduct cases. They also tout the strength derived from inter-departmental unity that the union would bring. Many economic studies have demonstrated a positive effect on worker wages and welfare for those in unions. Furthermore, op-eds and letters published in The Crimson have presented arguments for the union.
In turn, those who oppose unionization have argued that a student union would jeopardize individual bargaining agency, be inaccessible compared to existing resources for graduate students, and complicate the mentorship that students receive from their advisors. They also express concern over having a single union represent the diversity of Harvard’s graduate students. Some economic studies have demonstrated little or no effect on total compensation for those in graduate student unions. Other arguments published in The Crimson’s opinion pages have also outlined further criticisms of unionization.
Students eligible to vote in the election must familiarize themselves with arguments on both sides and cast informed votes, not only with an eye to their future at the University but also to the effects that unionization would have on their peers and their successors. We hope that graduate students and the University will work amicably and effectively to address issues facing student employees after the election, regardless of whether HGSU-UAW will represent students in this endeavor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The story describing the ongoing sexual harassment faced by Terry L. Karl by Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez at Harvard was heartbreaking—particularly because it is by no means unique, and mostly because it was she who suffered so deeply, not he. Karl first noted his behavior in 1981, and it was 37 years and 17 women’s accusations later that Harvard put Dominguez on leave, after which he resigned. Harvard’s “too little, too late” response is stupefying and infuriating.
Karl continued the conversation last week by noting Harvard’s insufficient follow-up by either the Provost or current University President—including, I glean, an apology.
The #MeToo movement began with overt harassment like that faced by Karl—and, most recently, by women in the Graduate School of Design—but has expanded greatly. Hollywood, for example, has highlighted differences in opportunities resulting from systemic sexism and gender discrimination that also come with dramatic discrepancies in pay, calling #TimesUp.
The extension of the conversation beyond overt sexual harassment and assault is thus vital: Gender discrimination is often less visible but far more pervasive. And, of course, the two are often intertwined.
As we also reflect on Lean In—a book by Facebook COO Sheryl K. Sandberg '91—five years hence, I wonder once again how far my own professional home for so long, the academy, has really come. In addition to stories like Karl’s, the vast majority of which go unheard, substantial differences remain in who’s at the top and who’s not. In 2015, 56 percent of professors were white men, compared to 27 percent white women; black females comprised an additional 2 percent and Hispanic females 1 percent. The average salary was higher for men every year between 1995 and 2015, during which time the wage gap actually increased. Women scientists are cited less frequently than their male counterparts (0.7 to 1), one reason I began my career publishing under my gender-neutral initials. Women faculty also perform more administrative responsibilities than men, among so many other often-unconscious sexist behaviors that compromise productivity and advancement. And, as in countless professional settings, mansplaining is commonplace—so much so that this blog about the phenomenon in academic settings went viral.
I was first introduced to gender anomalies as a new graduate student in 1993, when a male advisor confided that I was known as “Ice Queen.” It was then I first learned that the dispassionate objectivity so prized in science was only okay for men; the same behavior was perceived as cold and unfeeling in women, a liability rather than strength.
Alas, the same is true in academia as it is everywhere: Women can’t be too loud, too smart, too challenging, too beautiful, too intense, too fat, too uppity, too… anything.
Indeed, pejorative perceptions regarding the same personality characteristics critical for success in men—ambition, assertiveness, and the like—often result in decreased likability and lower evaluations for women. Women are also judged more harshly when measured using student evaluations of teaching (SETs). There is a substantial body of research showing that SETs are biased against women due to role incongruity and other factors. Copious studies show that women score more poorly than men on SETs on average, including in clever experiments where only gender varied. Faculty of color are also hurt by SETs, thus black women are especially disadvantaged.
Differences in how students perceive a woman at the front of the classroom are rooted in slow-to-change social mores that, sadly, still need time to evolve. Such efforts go far beyond any single workplace. Nonetheless, there are steps the university can take to help level the playing field. One easy fix is abolishing SETs, which have other biases too, like higher evaluations for easier courses and those in non-quantitative fields, a double whammy for women teaching rigorous science classes. It is, moreover, increasingly evident that SETs do not even measure course and teaching effectiveness at all, regardless of gender.
In response, many have called for SETs to be eradicated from use altogether, with The Century Foundation going so far as to state that SETs may even violate a host of federal laws and regulations. A handful of schools thus no longer use SETs as a stand-alone tool, like the University of Connecticut. Yet the majority of universities continue employing SETs as the primary, if not sole, criterion for teaching success, a basis for tenure, promotion, and (re)hiring that tacitly perpetuates gender—and racial—discrimination.
My own stories in the ivory tower span 25 years across time and place. Like most women, I have far too many tales to tell that have gone on far too long. As a professor, I now face the ongoing agony of student evaluations, which have had devastating effects personally as well as professionally; my efforts to discuss the limitations of SETs were repeatedly ignored by administrators and colleagues. Other experiences include exploitation as a student, post-doctorate, and professor; misattribution of intellectual contributions and courses; and denial of equivalent professional titles compared to those who performed less work, over less time. I was also a victim of “misbehavior,” as one advisor euphemized—though what I said was “emotional abuse.” In all of these cases I either confronted the persons responsible—likely enhancing my “Ice Queen” persona—or brought the incidents to the awareness of mentors, department chairs, and ombudspersons. In no cases were my concerns taken seriously, let alone addressed.
Thank God for therapy.
Yet I consider myself lucky, especially when contemplating the horrors women like Karl faced, as have far too many in the #MeToo movement.
In light of the upcoming vote for graduate student unionization, I now find myself contemplating whether such an organization would have made a difference in my myriad encounters. The policies and procedures in place at Harvard are clearly insufficient and, moreover, designed to protect the University, not its employees. There is evidence that unions are helpful in many domains, including responding to sexual harassment and gender discrimination.
The academy has come a long way but must do more to stop sexual harassment and assault and gender discrimination alike. Those in positions of power should ask questions, listen and believe our stories, and act promptly and appropriately. Students and post-doctorates are particularly vulnerable: Surely, a union is a step in the right direction. Yet women suffer again and again, across all levels of the academic lifespan.
Ice queens, unite! It is we who must give Harvard the much-needed push it needs to lean in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What do your friends think of your column? Has it caused any problems or changed your friendships?”
A student asked me this a few weeks ago during a question and answer session about Crimson columnists. Now, I am a queer woman of color, and my column shows it. Logically (dear God, hopefully), queer friends would have no problem with a column like mine. Straight ones, however, might.
To begin, I want to preface this by cautioning the dangers of putting straight allies on a pedestal and letting their efforts eclipse the actual lived experiences of queer people. Allies are great, but the A in “LGBTQIA+” is not for Ally. There is something truly special about having queer friends who share similar experiences with you and “get” it. I can’t fully express how validating it’s been to have meaningful friendships with other queer people. But, queer and trans people shouldn’t feel forced to seek solace in friendships with other queer and trans people because their cis straight friends are missing the mark.
So what do my straight friends think of my column? Has it caused any problems?
To be honest, I hadn’t really thought about it, so that could be a good sign. My closest friends on campus were the ones who encouraged me to apply for a column and helped me fill out the application at the last minute. And my sister, who I consider one of my best friends, talked me through the decision to accept the columnist position—I was concerned about being publicly out, and she reassured me that she’d support me in any choice I made. Over a year later, she still helps me with brainstorming and editing for every piece I write. All in all, my closest straight friends have been incredibly supportive of my column and my queerness in general for a very long time.
For example, last summer I stayed on campus for work while most of my queer friends traveled elsewhere. Some of my closest friends, most of whom are straight, lived on campus near me. We had frequent movie nights, and during June (Pride month), they encouraged me to choose queer movies to watch together and even made their own recommendations of queer films that they thought I might like. This was my first time celebrating Pride month, and while I enjoyed marching in Pride and attending queer events, it was also great to see queerness integrated into our usual activities. I didn’t feel like I had to compartmentalize my queer identity from the rest of myself—on the contrary, my queerness was embraced and openly brought into our friendship.
A few months ago, I was distraught by the HCFA event featuring an “ex-gay” activist. After mentioning it briefly at dinner, my blockmates immediately canceled their Friday night plans to come with me to the protest, decking themselves out in rainbow clothes. Even after the protest, they spent the rest of the night checking in with me and making sure I was okay.
I’m grateful to have found some straight friends who affirm my identity, but I had to spend extra time and effort to find and cultivate these close friendships, as many of my straight acquaintances and classmates only perform allyship and weren’t as supportive once I got to know them better. I’ve lost many friends over the years because I felt uncomfortable being unapologetically queer around them. It’s deeply upsetting that many queer and trans folks don’t feel supported by their cis straight friends, and that my current friendships could be an anomaly.
I’m tearing up a bit as I write this because even the idea of the friendships I currently have was unimaginable before I came to college. I used to think that I would have to hide parts of myself to be worthy of anyone’s friendship, that I would need to seem straight to fit in. But, now I see that it would be difficult for me to have a close friendship with someone who didn’t affirm and celebrate every part of my identity.
Queerness is not separate from who I am; I bring all my identities into every friendship. Thus, allyship cannot be separate from friendship. To be a good friend to someone of a marginalized identity, you must strive to be a good ally to all people of that identity.
While my sexuality shouldn’t change many of my personal interactions with straight friends, they should be aware that the world does see me differently because I’m queer. Certain situations, like dating or interacting with family members, may look different for me because of my sexuality. Good friends try to understand these nuances and realize that the support I need in these situations may be different than that of a straight person.
For straight people who have queer friends, take it upon yourself to learn about BGLTQ issues, both broad and specific to your friends. Show up for issues affecting the BGLTQ community, whether that be through attending protests and rallies or speaking up when you hear a homophobic or transphobic statement. Be mindful of the amount of space you take up in queer spaces. Bring up BGLTQ topics you hear about in the news as a cue to your queer friends that these kinds of discussions are welcome. Ask your queer friends how you can best support them, especially after difficult personal or public experiences of homophobia or transphobia.
And to queer people who are in un-affirming friendships, know that you deserve to be wholly seen and embraced by all of your friends. Know that you shouldn’t have to hide who you are or feel bad about expressing queerness within your friendships. Know that it’s not your responsibility to help your friends be better allies. Know that it’s okay to leave friendships that make you feel uncomfortable or less worthy. It’s been a long, difficult journey for me to finally feel more welcomed and supported in my friendships, but I promise, it gets better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2018 at 12:03 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust called the forcible arrest of a black undergraduate by the Cambridge Police Department Friday night “profoundly disturbing” in an email sent to University affiliates Monday.
CPD officers arrested a College student Friday at the Corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse St. after tackling the undergraduate to the ground. Officers tackled the student, who was naked, after determining the undergraduate had previously taken narcotics.
CPD officers later wrote in a police report they tackled the student because he was making aggressive movements toward law enforcement. But members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association who witnessed the event have called CPD’s version of events “incorrect” and have said the officers tackled the student without provocation.
While on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the student in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff the undergraduate, according to the CPD police report.
Faust wrote in her email that the University does “not yet know all the facts” and cannot fully understand what occurred until “the necessary reviews have been completed.” CPD is undertaking an internal review of the incident given use of force was involved; internal reviews are mandated by CPD policy whenever force is used. Faust did not explicitly say whether Harvard is undertaking its own review of the incident.
“What we do know raises important issues about the relationship between police and the communities they serve, student health resources, and the manner in which University units operate with each other and with our partners in the community,” she wrote.
Faust wrote that the arrest occurred against “the backdrop of increasingly urgent questions about race and policing in the United States.”
In its statement Saturday evening, BLSA called the incident “a brutal instance of police violence.” Students gathered across campus Saturday and Sunday to discuss the incident and plan a response.
Faust wrote that she and other Harvard administrators will work with the City of Cambridge going forward to address the incident.
“We will work with City officials to address concerns members of our community have raised about interactions with the Cambridge Police Department,” Faust wrote. “We will be asking questions of ourselves, recognizing that the responsibility rests with the University to establish the conditions of trust necessary for effective campus policing and the delivery and coordination of effective health care.”
She added that this process will involve consulting students, faculty and staff.
“Ultimately, this is about building a community where people from all backgrounds and life experiences can come together confident in their ability to do their best work in a safe, supportive, and constructive environment,” she wrote.
Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis said Sunday that Harvard’s Office of General Counsel and Massachusetts Hall—traditionally, a reference to the University’s central administration—are “involved” in examining the Friday arrest.
Asked about the role of Massachussetts Hall in responding to the incident, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson referred reporters to Faust’s email to Harvard affiliates. Later asked about OGC's role in responding to the incident, Jackson provided an emailed statement.
“The Office of the General Counsel plays a role in working with institutional leaders to help understand consequential events and to advise on ways that institutional processes might be improved,” Jackson wrote in the statement.
Deans at a number of Harvard’s individual schools sent emails to school affiliates following the student’s arrest. Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 responded to the event in an email Saturday morning, writing that the Law School’s “immediate focus” is to provide support to the community.
Like Faust, Manning wrote that though the University is “still learning all the facts,” the incident has invoked a nationwide debate surrounding use of force by police officers.
“What occurred last night reminds us again of troubling questions about the relationship between police and the community nationwide—and particularly encounters with members of the Black community,” Manning wrote.
At the Graduate School of Education, two administrators—Executive Dean Jack Jennings and Associate Dean for Enrollment and Student Services Maritza Suyapa Hernandez—sent messages to students, faculty, and staff on Monday morning and afternoon, respectively.
Hernandez invited students to a community meeting on Tuesday to discuss the incident. She also listed resources that students could utilize if they are in need of support, including HUHS and Counseling and Mental Health Services.
Jennings, who co-wrote his message with Academic Dean Nonie K. Lesaux, extended Hernandez’s invitation to faculty and staff.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf sent an email to HKS affiliates shortly before Faust responded to the arrest on Monday. Like Manning, Elmendorf emphasized that the school wanted to support students who are “distressed” by the arrest.
“We are, of course, concerned about the well-being of that student,” Elmendorf wrote. “We are also concerned about the impact of this incident on the Kennedy School community.”
Elmendorf invited students to convene at the school’s Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Monday afternoon to reflect on the incident. Twenty-five students attended the meeting, which Robbin Chapman—the Kennedy School’s new diversity dean—co-hosted with Debra E. Isaacson, the associate dean for degree programs and student affairs.
Attendees charged that Elmendorf’s message was “unsatisfactory,” highlighting the fact that the email did not identify the victim as black and that Elmendorf sent it two days after the Friday incident, unlike administrators at the Law School and Graduate School of Education.
At a reception for Chapman following the meeting, Elmendorf addressed students’ feedback regarding his message and apologized that he “wasn’t clear.”
“I figured people know [about the incident] from The Crimson,” Elmendorf said. “I didn't think to spell this out, but I understand now after hearing some of the reactions that were around in this room.”
Elmendorf also said he should have sent the email to HKS affiliates on Saturday, rather than waiting until Monday. He explained that he had reached out to central administrators to learn more about the incident over the weekend.
“There were a lot of conversations among administrators about what happened and I didn't actually learn much in that meeting that had not been seen in The Crimson,” he said.
Elmendorf said HKS will respond to further developments “as best as we can.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 17, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson responded to a question asking about the Office of General Counsel's involvement by referring to a statement from University President Drew G. Faust. In fact, Jackson responded to that question by providing a separate emailed statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facebook has agreed to give unprecedented access to anonymized user data to a commission founded by Government Professor Gary King and Stanford Law Professor Nathaniel Persily in order to study the platform’s impact on elections and democracies.
King and Persily’s commission, composed of academics across the social sciences, will have access to all of Facebook’s user data in an anonymized form. The commission will also have the power to decide what data to give to independent researchers who will, for the first time in Facebook’s history, have the right to publish their findings without review by the company, according to King.
King said he and other social scientists have been trying to get access to large-scale social media data “for many years” with little success, but Facebook reached out to him “a few days” after it became public that Cambridge Anayltica—a political firm hired by Donald Trump's campaign—gained access to millions of Facebook user's private data and asked King to privately review their data to help them prevent similar mistakes in the future.
“I said, that’s noble of you, that’s terrific, and it would involve sharing data, which is a great thing, but there isn’t any way that would work, because I’m an independent academic,” King said.

The social media company ultimately agreed to the “two-part” project, which King said will both keep user data anonymized and ensure that the company can’t prevent publication of unfavorable findings.
Facebook announced the initiative on April 9 through a press release written by Elliott Schrage, vice president of communications and David Ginsberg, the company’s director of research.
“We think it’s an important new model for partnerships between industry and academia,” Schrage and Ginsberg wrote. “Our goals are to understand Facebook’s impact on upcoming elections — like Brazil, India, Mexico and the US midterms — and to inform our future product and policy decisions.”
King said that the project will receive no money from Facebook. Instead, he said the research will be independently funded by grants from a coalition of “ideologically and substantively diverse” foundations, including the Hewlett and Sloan Foundations.
Hewlett Foundation Communications Director Vidya Krishnamurthy said the Foundation is focused on “strengthening the values, norms, and institutions of US democracy,” but said that the contributing foundations have a variety of aims.
“All of the funders who are involved with this come at this from a slightly different lens, but we all have a shared interest in supporting independent research that helps us get an evidence basis of what’s going on and therefore, what are the problems here, and what are possible solutions,” Krishnamurthy said.
King said he and Persily plan to announce the members of the commission in the next few weeks, and Facebook has so far agreed to share its data for one year.
King and Nathan Williams, the communications director for the Sloan Foundation, both said they hoped the project would become a long-term collaboration.
“Ideally, a year from now, we’d say, let’s keep doing this, and let’s ask more questions. Let’s see how Facebook affects friendships or family relationships,” Williams said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life honored undergraduates and student organizations for their achievements and contributions to the College at the second annual Student Leadership Recognition Awards ceremony on Monday.
Despite torrential rain, College administrators and undergraduates gathered in the Student Organization Center at Hilles to honor eight individuals and three student organizations. These student leadership awards are part of the OSL’s “leadership development” initiative launched last year.
Many students were candidates for the three individual categories—Emerging Leader, Spirit of Harvard College, and Senior Veritas— and six student organizations were nominated for the three group categories—Collaboration, Innovation, and Inclusive Community Awards. A selection committee consisting of Undergraduate Council representatives and College administrators chose the winners.
This year, Jackson C. Walker ’21, Maya Jenkins ’21, and Meena Venkataramanan ’21, a Crimson news comper, were awarded the Thomas A. Dingman Emerging Leader Awards—newly named this year in honor of retiring Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67— an award specifically for freshmen leaders.
“Freshmen are not often in titled positions of leadership and so one of our motivations behind the awards in general was just to recognize people who are not formally recognized as leaders,” Dominique J. Erney ’19, who helped develop the event, said. “It was really important to us to reserve a category for freshmen.”
Both Venkataramanan and Jenkins said that they were “surprised” to receive the award.
“Being at a ceremony like this and being able to have been nominated for this award and receive this award is something that I never expected,” Venkataramanan said. “I am really grateful to my mentors and my nominators, and also obviously my family.”
Jenkins expressed similar sentiments about receiving the award.
“I was really excited mostly because I didn’t really think of my impact on campus as being notable or noticeable,” Jenkins said. “I feel really honored and I also feel motivated to continue to do more and to try to expand my reach as semesters go forward.”
Gemma Collins ’18, Juliana Rodriguez ’19, Alisha Ukani ’20, and Evan M. Bonsall ’19 received the Spirit of Harvard College Awards, and Nina Srivastava ’18 was awarded the Senior Veritas Award.
“It’s really emotional, I was sitting in the back tearing up as other people were receiving their awards, just thinking about the different ways that students impact Harvard,” Srivastava said. “It’s so humbling to just think about everything that Harvard has meant to me and thinking about seeing that recognized is really, really rewarding.”
Within the three student organization categories, the Harvard College VISION: Global Health Society received the Collaboration Award, the Harvard College South Asian Association received the Inclusivity Award, and MakeHarvard received the Innovation Award.
Alexander R. Miller, associate dean of student engagement, first developed this event last year alongside two undergraduates—Erney and Nicholas J. Albert ’20— who work within the OSL in an effort to acknowledge “the many facets of the mission of the College.”
“These awards are great ways to really acknowledge our students and student organizations while also acknowledging the work that they do that’s aligned with our mission,” Miller said.
Erney, who has been involved in this event since its inception, said that she helped plan the ceremony and was involved in the selection process of the winners.
“It’s always just very awe-inspiring to see people talk about their accomplishments and why their involved in what they are involved in, so that’s probably my favorite part,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Graduate students at the University of Connecticut completed a second round of bargaining last week, wrapping up negotiations for their campus’ bargaining unit that Harvard’s graduate union organizers often point to when arguing for the advantages of unionization.
Eligible Harvard graduate and undergraduate students will head to the polls on Wednesday and Thursday to weigh in on whether they want to begin collectively bargaining with the University through Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. If a majority vote in favor of unionization, the union could form a bargaining committee, which would then distribute surveys to determine the content of a proposed negotiating agenda.
For the UConn Graduate Employees Union-UAW, the bargaining process began with surveying members of the bargaining unit and analyzing responses to determine what the union should prioritize, according to Stephen Manicastri, an organizer for GEU-UAW. Union leadership then developed an agenda and allowed members to vote on it, Manicastri stated.
“The reason for that is that one, a union is a democratic institution, and two, having a majority of union members complete the survey gives you the power at the bargaining table to say, this is really what people need in order to be the best researchers and the best teachers they can be at this university,” Manicastri said.
After several months of negotiations, the University of Connecticut and its graduate student union reached an agreement last week. GEU-UAW’s first round of negotiations with administrators began in the fall of 2014 and finished in mid-April of 2015.
Manicastri said that the second round took around the same length of time, though he noted the process was made easier because the union was “more established” and had “basic language” in place to build upon.
“It can take about six months to a year, depending on what kind of mobilization there is among union members,” he added.
Though different precedents and regulations govern student unionization at private and public universities, University of Oregon Professor of Labor Education Gordon Lafer wrote in an email that he thinks there is “no great mystery” about how the bargaining at UConn would compare to the process at Harvard.
“The processes are essentially the same,” Lafer wrote.
In 2014, over 70 percent of graduate students at UConn voted in favor of a union. During Harvard’s first Nov. 2016 unionization election, later overturned on procedural grounds, about 52 percent of students voted against unionization.
Manicastri said that he thought the results of GEU-UAW’s negotiations helped convince students on his campus who did not support unionization. According to Manicastri, the contract includes increases to tuition waivers and stipends, interim protections for those who comes forward with sexual harassment allegations, and reduced workloads for research assistants in lab.
“There were obviously people that were skeptics and people that are ideologically opposed to unions,” he said. “The way that you reach out, you kind of show them that this does work, that this process does work.”
University spokespeople declined to comment when asked how Harvard’s administration would handle negotiations if this week’s vote is in favor of unionization.
In an email sent two weeks ago, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 highlighted resources that are already available to graduate students absent collective bargaining, including the University’s Title IX officers and the Harvard International Office.   University officials have also repeatedly encouraged students to consider the “potential impact of unionization” and vote in the election.

With Harvard’s second unionization election set for Wednesday and Thursday, union organizers, University officials, and anti-union students are making final preparations for the vote, as well as a last push to reach eligible voters.
The election will determine whether over 4,000 eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants will collectively bargain with the University.
This week’s vote will be Harvard’s second unionization election. The University also held an election in Nov. 2016, the results of which were subject to over a year of legal disputes between union organizers and the University before the National Labor Relations Board over the election’s validity. In subsequent rulings, the NLRB decided that the eligible voter list generated by the University did not meet the agency’s standards and ordered a second election.
Organizers for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers say much of the next 48 hours will be business as usual.
Andrew B. Donnelly, an HGSU-UAW organizer, wrote in an email that organizers’ pitch to eligible voters remains the same. In the run-up to this election, organizers have often emphasized a proposed union’s ability to negotiate for increases in graduate students’ pay, protections against sexual harassment, and advocacy for international students.
“No change in plans: we're trying to talk to as many people as we can about how organizing a union will provide more stability in our pay, secure protections against mistreatment or sexual harassment, and provide a process by which we can collectively bargain and democratically approve a contract,” Donnelly wrote.
In the past several days, union organizers have canvassed campus dorms and dinings halls to solicit support for the effort. The union has also garnered several new endorsements from students groups and faculty.
LGBTQ@GSAS, a group for BGLTQ graduate students, released a statement supporting the union Monday afternoon. HGSU-UAW also published endorsements from Harvard professors Cornel R. West ’74 and Virginie Greene as well as MIT professor and author Junot Díaz in support of the effort to unionize.
Students opposed to unionization are also making final pushes, posting a draft email outlining arguments against the union on the Against HGSU-UAW Facebook page last Wednesday.
“If this union proposal passes, it will have unprecedented and permanent repercussions for Harvard graduate students. We believe that it would not confer a net-benefit on our grad student community,” the email reads.
Unionization opponents, who in the past have argued that the union has a disproportionate advantage in communicating with eligible voters, appeared in recent weeks to emulate some of the outreach strategies used by HGSU-UAW, such as creating a Facebook filter for their cause and asking students to participate in video testimonials.
In the past several days, University administrators have sent their own emails to eligible voters, informing students of the election and encouraging them to read up on the issues.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote that the University is continuing to “focus on encouraging all eligible students to vote” in the final days of the run-up.
“This is an important decision that will impact current and future Harvard students,” Cowenhoven wrote. “It is critical that students make their voices heard by voting this week."
Polling places at the Queen’s Head Pub in Cambridge and Harvard Dental School in Longwood will be open for both days of the election. An additional location at Harvard Business School will be available Thursday morning.
At the polling places, an equal number of observers from the union and from the University will stationed to count and check ballots. They will also assist in identifying voters and, if need be, challenging ballots, according to the election notice released by the NLRB.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard students faced grueling conditions—including heavy rains, strong winds, and biting temperatures—to cross the finish line of the 122nd annual Boston Marathon on Monday.
Founded in 1897, the Boston Marathon is the oldest annual marathon in the world. This year marks five years since the Boston Marathon bombings, which killed three and injured hundreds more. Since the bombings, the race has taken on a greater significance for Boston, becoming a symbol of the city’s resilience. More than 30,000 people ran this year’s race.
“It was great. It was cold, wet, and windy, but spirit was incredible, and I don’t know—I had a really fun time,” Emma P. Seevak ’20 said. “It was more fun than I was expecting. I obviously did it because I thought it would be fun, but it was more fun than I was expecting. I was smiling for a lot of it.”
Seevak, along with four other college students, ran as part of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, which raises money for the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Summer Urban Program. Other students ran the marathon independently.
Craig F. Rodgers, a counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel, said a similar initiative at Tufts inspired him to start the Marathon Challenge. He said he spoke with University president-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, who was president of Tufts at the time, to learn more about starting such a program in 2005.
“Prior to 2005, I saw many yellow jerseys on the Boston Marathon route that said Tufts. And I always, when I would see these Tufts jerseys, I thought it would be neat if Harvard had a presence at the Marathon too. So I spoke with the person who was most familiar with the Tufts program, who was Larry Bacow,” Rodgers said. “So we started a much smaller version of that program here at Harvard.”
Brittany A. Petros ’18 said she chose to participate in the Marathon Challenge as a capstone to her college running career.
“I started running in college,” Petros said. “And I thought that, having spent four years running along the Charles and in Boston, it’d be such a nice way to conclude my running journey at college.”
The rain presented unexpected challenges to student runners—causing some to come up with creative solutions.
“I actually wore racquetball glasses to protect from the rain,” said Jacob N. Russell ’19. “Then my headphones broke because of the rain—and that put a damper on things.”
Seevak also struggled with the weather.
“The worst part during the race was definitely when my fingers were too cold to eat the Welch’s fruit snacks that I’d packed,” Seevak said. “And I took my gloves off and then they were too wet to get my fingers back inside of them.”
Yet despite the physical challenges brought about by the rain, Seevak said the weather actually helped her in the end.
“I think the rain ended up psychologically being a really good thing for me,” said Seevak. “I think when I realized how miserable the weather conditions would be, I was like ‘OK, I need to stop thinking so much about what my time will be, and instead just focus on making the best of whatever the situation is.’”
Russell, who ran despite a knee condition, said he drew inspiration from the encouraging crowd.
“Literally everywhere you go from the very start to the very end there’s people lining the street and just cheering you on trying to give you high fives,” said Russell. “Especially little kids—it’s nice to think that they’re looking up to you, and even though you might be in a world of pain right now, that these kids still idolize you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students handed out information sheets about issues of diversity and inclusion at New Admit Day Friday to raise awareness of their concerns about minority representation at the school.
The school has faced internal criticism recently about the lack of minority students, faculty, and staff. Students have been at the forefront of pushing for more diversity at the school, urging administrators to hire and recruit more minority faculty and students. Student activists have met on several occasions with Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf to raise their concerns and offer recommendations about improving the numbers of underrepresented minorities.
New Admit Day was a venue for many of these students to voice concerns about the current state of diversity at HKS while also highlighting the school’s recent progress, organizers of the initiative said. The flyer—handed to prospective students as they attended panels and speeches throughout the day—discussed recent Crimson articles about diversity at the Kennedy School, listed “ongoing” diversity initiatives including the engagement of more faculty around these conversations, and invited admitted students to various events centered around this work.
The flyer also included a link to an open letter the students plan to present to new Diversity Dean Robbin Chapman at a meeting of the Kennedy School Student Government Tuesday.
Students who organized, designed, and handed out the sheets said they wanted to educate new students about the work they said still needs to be done.
“There’s been a lot of momentum building around issues of diversity and inclusion and wanting to keep the conversation going, and wanting to make sure that the first year students who are going to be here next year are part of the conversation,” Meredith Davis-Tavera, a co-chair for the HKS Latinx Caucus, said.
Davis-Tavera also said conversations about diversity have not been a part of New Admit Day, adding that the initiative’s organizers wanted to emphasize ongoing student activism around minority recruitment.
“Part of it was wanting students to be aware of the fact that we know that HKS isn't the most diverse place, but also that there's a big contingent of students that really care about the issue and have devoted a lot of time to the issue,” Davis-Tavera said.
Kennedy School spokesperson Thoko Moyo wrote in an emailed statement that the school supports conversations around minority representation and inclusion.
“At the Kennedy School we encourage open and honest dialogue on a range of important issues, including how to enhance diversity, inclusion and belonging at the Kennedy School and in the world,” Moyo said.
Some current students at the school expressed their concern about the flyers discouraging students from ultimately attending.
“I’m glad that these important issues are getting the attention that they deserve, but not thrilled with some of the tactics used,” Sasha Ramani, a current student ambassador with the HKS admissions office, said. “This instantly created a combative atmosphere, and I don’t think that this would be helpful at recruiting minorities.”
Rosi Greenberg, a current student who helped plan the flyers, said organizers “talked a lot” about not wanting to push prospective students away from the school but said she believed they were able “hit the sweet spot.”
Newly admitted student Aaron Huang said he was “undecided” before coming to New Admit Day but that the presence of students interested in promoting diversity tipped his decision in favor of the Kennedy School.
“I think along with other people interested in policy we're really looking to see how we can effect positive change in the world, and with this flyer, it was a call to act at the Kennedy School,” Huang said. “I felt like that was one immediate way that I could affect change is to join the Kennedy School and figure out how I could improve diversity at one of our country's top policy schools.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2018 at 3:40 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council voted at its Sunday meeting to allocate $8,000 to subsidize summer storage for certain low-income students.
Residents and soon-to-be residents in Quincy, Dunster, Winthrop, Mather, and Leverett Houses who are eligible for the Student Events Fund—a College initiative that provides event tickets to undergraduates with demonstrated financial need—will be eligible for the $35 subsidy.  According to the legislation, these five houses are the only ones that currently do not provide “free storage options” for their residents.
The UC sent a survey to residents of the five houses that don’t provide free storage to gauge  their storage needs. Of the 575 students who responded, over 50 percent reported they spend at least $100 on storage each year. In addition, over 97 percent of respondents reported they would “take advantage” of a free or subsidized storage option if it were available to them.
Quincy House Representative Sarah Fellman ’18—who sponsored the legislation—said she and First-Year Class Committee chair Rushi A. Patel ’21 have discussed with Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 the possibility of obtaining funding from the College for summer storage. Patel and Fellman have broached a variety of ideas with Brandt at these meetings, including integrating storage funding into the financial aid package, according to Patel.
“It seems like this is something that the OSL and that Lauren Brandt care about,” Fellman said.  “The Financial Aid office has been responsive to us and to her.”
In the meantime, though, the legislation’s co-sponsors reiterated the short-term needs of certain students.
“We want to help people now because people are really financially burdened with this now,” Fellman said.  “We want to get good data on how important this is for students and we want to keep working with administrators to make a longer-term and fuller solution.”
Patel said they asked administrators about possibly allowing residents of houses without storage to use available spaces in other houses, but he said administrators told them that all storage spaces already reach capacity during the summer.
Finance Committee chair Henry S. Atkins ’20 asked Fellman about the long-term goal of this legislation.
“The specific policy is what the administration is willing to do,” Fellman said. “The general policy is we don’t want students to have to pay for storage, especially inequitably.”
Sunday’s vote to subsidize summer storage marks the Council’s second effort in less than a  month to financially support SEF-eligible students. At a meeting in late March, the Council voted to subsidize purchase of bicycles and other means of transportation for SEF-eligible students in the Quad. The UC voted the following week to include Dunster and Mather in the program.
In response to a question from Education Committee chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 about storage costs at other institutions like Yale and Stanford, Fellman said that on average, summer storage costs at those schools were higher for students. Storage, she said, could be one Harvard perk that informs prospective students’ college decisions.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: April 18, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated Sarah Fellman '18 co-sponsored the legislation regarding summer storage. In fact, Fellman sponsored the legislation.
CORRECTION: April 18, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Undergraduate Council voted at its Sunday meeting to allocate $7,000 to subsidize summer storage for certain low-income students. In fact, the UC voted to allocate $8,000 for that purpose.

UPDATED: April 20 at 12:50 a.m.
Reince Priebus, former chief of staff for President Donald Trump, was named a Visiting Fellow for spring 2018 at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
Priebus, who also served as the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, will be on campus from April 23 until April 25. Throughout his time at Harvard, Priebus will attend “a number of events” and “engage” with students at the IOP, according to a Monday press release.
“We are pleased to welcome Reince Priebus to campus as a Visiting Fellow during the Spring semester,” IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said in the statement. “His experience and insight from years in politics, from the local to national level, as well as his time as Chief of Staff to President Trump, will be of great interest to our community.”
Priebus’s fellowship comes at a time when the IOP is facing scrutiny following a series of controversial fellow appointments. Last fall, the IOP appointed Chelsea Manning, a former Army soldier who went to prison for leaking classified military documents, as a visiting fellow but later rescinded the fellowship offer after backlash from then-CIA Director and secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo. At the end of last year, Sean Spicer, the former press secretary for Trump, faced scrutiny for only hosting off-the-record events on campus. Spicer returned to campus last week for another off-the-record meeting.
Abigail P. Bloomfield '20 and Shreeya G. Panigrahi '19, student chairs of the IOP's Fellows and Study Groups program, wrote in an emailed statement that Priebus will provide “guidance” and “advice” to students.
“The Institute of Politics has a long tradition of inviting individuals of varied backgrounds, experiences, and political beliefs to participate in a thoughtful and productive dialogue on Harvard’s campus,” Bloomfield and Panigrahi wrote. “Not only will Mr. Priebus engage the campus in the most relevant political conversations of today, he will also provide valuable guidance and advice to students.”
Other IOP visiting fellows for the school year include former Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, political commentators Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, and former President and CEO of the NAACP Cornell William Brooks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 21, 2018 at 7:05 p.m.
An influential pro-Greek life political action committee is pushing for legislation that could threaten Harvard’s ability to enforce its social group sanctions and has added a graduate member of the Porcellian Club to its board of directors.
Harvard’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions, from serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious post-graduate fellowships.
But a bill currently working its way through Congress could imperil Harvard’s social group policy. The bill, known as the PROSPER Act, proposes an update to the Higher Education Act that could force the University to choose between implementing its sanctions and receiving millions of dollars in federal research funding.
The PAC in question—the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee—forms part of a group, the Fraternal Government Relations Coalition, that retained the law firm Arnold & Porter to lobby Congress around the PROSPER Act starting in 2017, according to public filings.  FGRC, which also includes fraternity and sorority umbrella organizations the North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference, has previously worked with Arnold & Porter on issues related to the Higher Education Act.
FSPAC's previously unreported move to join the fray means Harvard will face significant firepower on the Hill in its fight to preserve the social group sanctions. University President Drew G. Faust, referencing the PROSPER Act, has said she is “distressed” by what she called Republican lawmakers’ attempts to interfere with internal University affairs.
FSPAC added Lars E. Peterson ’68, a graduate member of the Porcellian, to its board of directors for 2017-2018, according to records available on the PAC’s website. No member of a Harvard final club previously sat on the PAC’s board of directors for at least the past five years, public filings show. Every other FSPAC board member is affiliated with a Greek organization—as has been the case for at least the past five years.
Peterson wrote in an email that he and many other alumni are “gravely concerned” about Harvard’s sanctions.
“I found the FSPAC represented a nationwide network of allies already hard at work at supporting the elected officials committed to preserving every student's right to gather with others in the organizations that best suit their needs,” he wrote.
Arnold & Porter is also overseeing lobbying efforts around the PROSPER Act for the Cambridge Coalition, a band of Harvard final clubs and Greek organizations that includes the Porcellian. The Wall Street Journal first reported in Feb. 2018 that final club members are lobbying Congress in an effort to counteract Harvard’s sanctions.
Kevin O’Neill, an Arnold & Porter lobbyist working for both the Cambridge Coalition and the FGRC, also serves as executive director for FSPAC, according to publicly available documents.
FSPAC President Marc Katz wrote in an email that the PAC condemns Harvard’s sanctions.
“The FSPAC strongly opposes Harvard’s blacklisting of students who exercise their fundamental freedom of association rights off-campus and on their own time,” Katz wrote. “That was our position before Mr. Peterson joined our board, and we appreciate the perspective Lars brings to this issue as a Harvard alumnus.”
FSPAC is the premier political arm for fraternities and sororities in the United States. The group has lobbied Congress in the past around legislation related to the ways in which colleges investigate and seek to prevent sexual assault on campus.
The group has historically had success in its lobbying efforts. Several years ago, FSPAC may have stymied legislation meant to curtail hazing.
The PAC significantly increased its donations to key supporters of the PROSPER Act this year. The group focused on legislators who have been supportive of an amendment to the act, first introduced in Dec. 2017, that makes the bill potentially pertinent to Harvard’s social group sanctions.
Representative Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican, introduced the amendment, which would ban schools that have “a policy allowing for the official recognition of single-sex student organizations” from imposing penalties on members of the groups. Because Harvard does not officially recognize single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, the amendment does not currently apply to the University.
The Cambridge Coalition and other opponents of the sanctions hope to change that by altering the language of the amendment.
FSPAC has upped its donations to Guthrie, giving him $10,000 in 2018, ten times what the group donated to the representative in 2016, according to public lobbying records. FSPAC’s donation of $10,000 marked the highest amount the PAC gave to any individual candidate.
The PAC also increased its givings to Representative Elise Stefanik ’06, a New York Republican and a Harvard alumna; The Crimson reported in Dec. 2017 that Stefanik is pushing for the social group amendment to the PROSPER Act.
FSPAC donated $2,000 to Stefanik in 2018, twice what the group donated to her in 2016, public lobbying records show.
The PAC also gave $10,000 to Virginia Foxx—a main architect of the PROSPER Act—in 2018, according to public filings.
FSPAC has a “history” of giving to the three representatives which predates “the Harvard controversy,” Katz wrote in an email. He added Peterson was “not on the board when the PAC made spending decisions for 2017.”
“We have increased our fundraising substantially this cycle, which has given us the chance to increase our contributions to many members we have previously supported in both chambers and across both political parties,” Katz wrote.
Peterson’s addition to FSPAC’s board came around the time he made a $5,000 donation to the PAC in 2017, public filings show.
All members of FSPAC’s board of directors are required to donate to the committee, Katz wrote in his email. Katz also noted the $5,000 donation represents the maximum contribution allowed under law.
The PAC held a webinar on March 29 to update donors on efforts to lobby around the PROSPER Act. Lawyers from Arnold & Porter spoke to donors about how the PROSPER Act could affect single-sex campus social groups, according to the PAC’s website.
“Lawmakers are considering legislation that will have a tremendous impact on the future of fraternities and sororities—most notably our rights to remain single-sex organizations,” the website reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A segment of the Undergraduate Council issued a statement Monday evening sharply criticizing Harvard for what the UC called the school’s “failure” to keep students safe in the wake of the Cambridge Police Department’s forcible arrest of a black undergraduate.
The statement also affirms that the Council stands “in solidarity” with the arrested student as well as with black Harvard affiliates more broadly.
“We want to express our solidarity with the Black community in this painful time,” UC members wrote. “We recognize that anti-Black racism at Harvard, in Cambridge, and in our world at large is systemic and institutional.”
CPD officers arrested the undergraduate Friday at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse St. after receiving several calls about the student, who was standing naked and had thrown his clothes at a bystander.
A CPD police report released after the incident states the officers tackled the undergraduate after he made aggressive advances toward law enforcement. But eyewitnesses of the arrest—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—later called CPD’s version of events “incorrect” and stated that the officers tackled the student “without provocation.”
While the student was on the ground, at least one officer punched him five times in an attempt to unpin his arms and handcuff the undergraduate, according to the report. The student was ultimately charged on several counts including assault, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest.
BLSA has called the incident an instance of police brutality.
“Though we do not yet know all the facts of the event leading up to the incident, we do know that a Black Harvard student was struck five times in the torso by a police officer while three other officers pinned him to the ground–clearly an excessive use of force,” the UC representatives wrote in their statement, emailed to the student body. “Like so many members of the community, we are outraged, horrified, and disgusted by these events.”
The UC representatives also criticized what they called a “failure” on the part of Harvard to adequately respond to the student’s needs prior to his arrest.
“On Friday, the very institutions that were supposed to keep us safe at Harvard failed us, failed the Black community, and failed a valued member of our community,” they wrote.  “This abject failure to keep students safe engenders deep distrust in the notion that Harvard prioritizes the safety of students in need of medical attention and transport to HUHS, especially students disproportionately subject to discrimination and police violence.”
University spokespeople could not immediately be reached for comment late Monday evening.
The student involved in the incident is currently undergoing evaluation at a hospital for issues including mental health concerns—and the ongoing evaluation is “one of the reasons” the student has yet to be arraigned, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr.  said at a press conference Monday. Bard did not directly answer a question Monday asking whether charges against the student could be dropped in light of the undergraduate’s mental health.
University President Drew G. Faust called the student’s arrest “disturbing” in an email she sent to Harvard affiliates Monday afternoon. Faust also pledged to work with the City of Cambridge moving forward to address the incident.
The UC letter demands accountability for those involved both directly and indirectly in the arrest and asserts Harvard and local institutions should treat this event as an opportunity to enact change.
“This must also be a time for answers, for accountability, and for structural change,” the statement reads. “Those involved and those complicit in this incident must be held accountable.”
CPD plans to hold an internal review of the student’s arrest given the officers involved used force to apprehend the undergraduate. CPD policy mandates the department must conduct this kind of review whenever officers use force.
Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis said at a UC meeting Sunday that Harvard’s Office of General Counsel—as well as Massachusetts Hall—is “involved” in examining the student’s arrest.
Bard said at the press conference that the department will make the results of its internal review public.  He also said he “absolutely” supports the officers involved in the incident.
The UC members who wrote the letter also questioned the sequence of events Friday.
“If Harvard cannot ensure the safe transport of marginalized students to HUHS when they are in need of medical attention, these students will suffer, facing a decision between two dangerous options: not seeking care and seeking care that puts them at risk for police violence and further harm,” they wrote. “For example, this incident raises doubts about the spirit behind and safety in activating the alcohol and drugs amnesty policy, as despite the fact that HUHS was called to help, the student in question was not safely transported to HUHS.
“Instead, he was arrested, charged with a crime, and brutalized by CPD,” the UC members wrote.
The amnesty policy the UC representatives referenced in their statement stipulates that, if a Harvard undergraduate brings “an intoxicated or drug-impaired friend” to HUHS or to another hospital—or to seek help from College residential staffers or HUPD—neither the student nor the friend “will face disciplinary action from the College for having used or provided alcohol or drugs.”
In response to a UC representative’s question Sunday asking why the amnesty policy was not applied during the incident Friday, Davis said he is unsure.
“I hope to hell it’s being looked at,” Davis said.
Council members also wrote in the statement they feel the UC’s response to the arrest came too late.
“We want to acknowledge that we are one of the groups that needs to be held accountable to being responsive to student needs,” the representatives wrote. “This message is coming too late; we wish we had responded sooner.”
“We know that as elected representatives, it is our job to respond to and advocate for student concerns in real time,” the members added. “We know that the burden of proof is on us as a council to earn your trust.”
All but five active members of the UC signed the letter. The five who did not sign the statement either could not be reached for comment or declined to comment late Monday evening.
“We promise to advocate for structural change to ensure events like this never happen again,” the letter concludes.
UC President Catherine Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 wrote in an email accompanying the Council members’ statement that the two plan to send a follow-up email detailing action items including meetings with administrators, conversations with undergraduate leaders, and a town hall slated to be held next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spokespeople for Harvard University Health Services and the Harvard University Police Department said both organizations followed proper protocol before and during the arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate Friday that has sparked allegations of police brutality.
HUHS was contacted about the student, who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics. But the Cambridge Police Department ultimately arrived on the scene and made the arrest, charging the undergraduate on several counts including assault, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest.
An account of events given by the Harvard Black Law Students Association stated that HUHS transferred the call directly to CPD, drawing questions from some students as to why HUHS immediately contacted an outside police department and causing some to wonder whether officials involved followed proper protocol.
But HUPD spokesperson Stephen G. Catalano wrote in an email Monday that HUHS actually contacted HUPD first. Catalano said HUPD then transferred the call to CPD, which he described as the “department with primary jurisdiction.”
CPD had jurisdiction because the student—who was arrested at the intersection of Massachusetts Ave. and Waterhouse St., feet from Harvard Law School’s campus—was not standing on campus and was thus outside HUPD’s jurisdiction, Catalano wrote. HUPD has to inform other police departments of any incidents that take place outside of Harvard’s campus, according to Catalano.
HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry wrote that HUHS has conducted a review of  “what occurred on Friday evening.” He wrote that HUHS called HUPD “per standard protocol” and that “jurisdictional requirements” mandated that HUPD transfer the call to CPD.
“We have confirmed that HUHS’s standard protocol was followed,” he wrote.
Catalano likewise wrote that HUPD followed proper protocol.
“In a case where HUHS calls the HUPD for an incident occurring off campus we would either connect HUHS to the local police department with jurisdiction or HUPD would contact them directly,” Catalano wrote.
Catalano wrote in a separate email Monday that, after HUPD initially notified CPD of the situation, CPD then asked HUPD to come to the scene. But by the time HUPD arrived, CPD had already made the arrest, Catalano wrote.
“We transferred the call. CPD then called us back to come to scene,” Catalano wrote. “Upon arrival the student was under arrest.”
CPD officers arrested the student Friday night after a physical encounter. Officers tackled the student to the ground.
Officers from CPD later wrote in a police report that they tackled the student because he was making aggressive movements toward law enforcement. But members of BLSA who witnessed the event have stated CPD’s version of events is “incorrect,” stating that officers tackled the student “without provocation.”
While the student was on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff the undergraduate, according to the CPD police report. Some University affiliates have called the arrest an instance of police brutality; students, faculty, and staff held gatherings in the days after the incident to respond, reflect, and organize.
Perry wrote in an email that HUHS and HUPD have “long established relationships and protocols” that outline “the role each unit plays in all situations involving the Harvard community.”
“HUHS’s standard protocol is to contact HUPD for any emergency concern related to a Harvard student. In instances when an incident occurs off campus, HUPD is required to involve the police department with jurisdiction over the location,” he wrote. “In cases where a life-threatening emergency is possible, HUHS will recommend the caller contact 911 immediately.”
“Any call to 911 will trigger a response by Professional Ambulance and the police department with jurisdiction,” he added.
CPD is conducting an internal review in the wake of the arrest given the incident involved a use of force. CPD policy mandates the department must conduct this kind of review any time force is used.

With classes and activities wrapping up for the school year, many people’s minds have turned to their summer plans. And as the high-achieving (read: competitive) group of students that we are, everyone wants to be sure of what they’re doing for the summer—and what everyone else is doing. It’s news if your only plans for the summer are to enjoy the break and not work a high-profile internship, but there are several reasons why you should consider doing just that.
Recharge from the Year
With high stress levels on campus during the school year, it’s important to give yourself some time off to recharge for the next school year. Working a stressful job could leave you more exhausted, putting you in a state primed for mid-semester burnout. Your mental health is more important than one bullet on your resume!
Spend Time with Friends and Family
You spend every semester buried under school work and various activities, and thus might not have enough time to see your friends and family. Summer is the perfect time to catch up with these far-flung but familiar faces. You can make lasting memories with them that will remind you of how much you love them (but also why it wasn’t such a bad idea to move hundreds of miles away from their prying questions).
Work a “Normal” Job
So many people working prestigious, but unpaid internships. Your most fulfilling option for a summer experience could be a minimum-wage service job. Let’s be honest, we could all be taken down a peg after spending some time in Harvard’s ego-boosting bubble, and nothing keeps you humble like a job at your local restaurant. Making money is nice too, especially when the work is mindless.
There are many useful things that you can do with your summer even if you don’t have definitive plans that directly contribute to your ten-year plan to become a partner at Goldman Sachs. Sometimes, the best use of your time is to do nothing. And being a Harvard student with “McDonalds” as an employer on your resume is as much (if not more) of an interview conversation-starter than summer analyst at some start-up.

Visitas hosts are responsible for caring for sweet, naive prefrosh and immersing them in the Harvard experience any way they can. But you might not always get what you bargained for. Here are the types of hosts you might meet this weekend...
The Neglector
They’ll probably send one of their friends to pick you up, or maybe just text that they’ll be busy for the day and leave you to find your way to the Quad on your own (good luck). If you didn’t bring a sleeping bag, don’t be hopeful: there’s going to be a hardwood floor waiting for you. If you’re lucky, they’ll tape their door so that even if they’re not there for you, their room is. If not, have fun exploring the halls as their locked door stares you down.
The Overbooker
They’ve got good intentions, but at the cost of living space. At night, you’ll arrive to see three other prefrosh huddled around the futon or scattered around the common room. However, this kind of host tends to be very friendly and eager to talk about anything; after all, they did sign up to take in a bunch of prefrosh. Plus, while sleeping arrangements may be cozy, you’ll have friends to navigate Annenberg with the next morning.
The Advantageous Humorer
The worst type. They’ll feed you plain wrong information about Harvard, send you on pointless errands, and make fun of you with their weird Harvard humor. They’ll use words like comp, Q guide, and more acronyms than any sane human should be expected to keep track of, reveling in the fact that you’ll have no idea what they’re talking about. Don’t despair: your true Harvard experience will be much better than the one this clown prepared for you.
The Reminiscer
From the moment you show up, they won’t stop telling you about their own Visitas experience. They may only be a sophomore, but things were so different when they were just discovering Harvard. On the upside, it will be super easy to get them to talk about their Harvard experience. On the downside, they might be sneakily trailing you to events just to experience the ~thrill~ all over again. You thought it was weird to have your parents following you around? Now try a random college student you barely even know.
The All-Star
Through every stressful essay, late night p-set session, and frantic midterm prep sesh, one thing has kept this type of host going: Visitas is coming. There is truly nothing they are more excited to do than welcome you into their cramped dorm room where there’s a comfy futon waiting for you. Your schedule will be packed, but they’ll still insist on grabbing brunch with you or running to Zinneken's for a late night waffle together. If you get this host, consider yourself lucky—it’s always nice to have an upperclassman friend when you get on campus this fall.
No matter which host you get, your schedule will be so packed with free food events, *highly recommended* talks from faculty, and trying to meet as many people as possible that you probably won’t end up spending much time with your host at all. Overall, the best piece of advice we can offer is: Whoever your host may be, keep track of their spare key.
