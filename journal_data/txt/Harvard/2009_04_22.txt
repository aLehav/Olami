A drag queen and an archaeologist walk into a bar. Literally. 
This past Saturday, the first Harvard Australian Studies Symposium brought Australian and American archaeologists together. And this past Saturday, a scheduling mishap bridged even greater divides by bringing these archaeologists to the Queen’s Head Pub Drag Show.
Did they enjoy an activity that didn’t lie in ruins?  
“Absolutely. I’m actually a woman,” said Australian archaeologist Ken Mulvaney, who despite a single earring, looked convincingly masculine with his titanic grey beard. 
“I haven’t worn a dress in years,” said Gary A. Hanes, of the University of Nevada-Reno, seeming to get into the show more and more as the free beers kept coming. “Whoops,” he added. 
“It’s been educational,” said Mark W. Moore, a post-doc at the University of New England.  “Say I was excavating an archaeological site and found a pair of pumps. I would have assumed it was a female artifact—but now no longer. It’s been an epiphany.”
As for the drag show itself, things went off with enough beauty and grace to make anyone question their assumptions (thanks to a Drag Workshop held in the Harvard College Women’s Center two weeks ago). 
“When I twirl, it floats,” Roger J. Merado ’10 said with an incredulous look as ze twirled hir goddess-like skirt. 
“Hormoney”, née Brandon T. Perkovitch ’11, pushed boundaries by sporting a light meadow of chest hair, which peeked coyly out from hir dress.  
“I think it adds an element of excitement, and of exploration,” ze said.
But even at such a beautiful event, drama reared hir ugly head.
“This was the best night ever until my boyfriend came and saw me dressed as a woman,” said Bambi, a Harvard student who wished to be referred to by his stage name. Bambi’s distraught boyfriend soon stormed off.
So have you heard the one about the archaeologist who discovered a drag queen? It’s hirsterical!

With the loss of Loker Commons, Lamont Cafe has become what some students consider the closest thing Harvard has to an official student center. The issue of social space has also recently emerged at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where certain faculty members are seeking to increase awareness of the both the importance and existence of overlooked spaces. And just last month, the Undergraduate Council assembled a task force on social space. The issue of campus space has been on the table for decades among undergraduates, but lately it’s been gathering steam.
DEALING WITH A SPACE JAM 
According to UC representative Senan Ebrahim ’12, the UC began to focus on the problem of social space following a Town Hall meeting of various student groups, where participants expressed their frustration over the lack of gathering space for meetings and events. 
“It has become increasingly difficult for student groups to find spaces for events on a medium to large scale. Any kind of student group plan, when they try to plan it, becomes very difficult for them to find a space,” said Ebrahim. 
Ebrahim also noted that out-of-date guides to resources and limitations on booking common rooms create obstacles to securing gathering places. In addition to working toward creating new spaces, the UC will also tackle the organizational aspect of the issue by making current spaces more accessible. 
According to UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10, although the UC itself cannot look at real estate, it can encourage Harvard to investigate particular locations.
In particular, the UC is currently working on determining the fate of the Democracy Center, at 45 Mt. Auburn Street. 
“In terms of the Democracy Center on Mt. Auburn, the owners of that building are having a dialogue with some student groups,” said Flores. “Hopefully it does not get sold to some sort of group that wouldn’t allow students to use it. The real estate initiations are confidential, but both the owners and student group leaders that they have talked to are all in agreement that it should go to someone who would allow students to use it.” 
FINDING THE SPACE BETWEEN
While students are leading their own efforts, Harvard faculty members are also taking on the issue of social space. Recently, Harvard Graduate School of Design professor Jerold S. Kayden and assistant professor Martin Zogran shared the results of their joint study during a lecture on social space, entitled “Social Spaces at the Academy.” 
Together, Kayden and Zogran have been working with a team of students to identify existing social spaces and evaluate how to best enhance them to benefit the Harvard community. 
Zogran described the connection between the richness of student life and the existence of social spaces. 
“I think that in the recent past there has been some sort of feeling that somehow student activities and general welfare outside of coursework is a little bit lacking,” said Zogran. “So being architects and urban designers, we tend to look at the structure of the physical environment to see if that is a contributing factor.”
Zogran noted that current spaces on campus can be transformed to make them more conducive to student gathering. 
“The big picture isn’t a lack of social spaces, but rather a lack of use of existing social spaces,” said Zogran.   
In their lecture, they suggested that simple implementations like benches or more comfortable chairs can be the key to improvement. They also explained that while most social spaces are planned, some arise spontaneously. 
SPACE DISGRACE 
According to Flores, due to the lack of social spaces at Harvard, certain venues arise as inevitable fall-backs.
“You get a reliance on social clubs, and that isn’t a bad thing. Social clubs provide a community, but they’re not all inclusive. So there are not a lot of centralized social spaces that any student can rely on for the weekends,” said Flores. “We really don’t have that because suite parties are harder to have without the party funds, student groups are competing for four main party spaces on campus, and everything else has to be in final clubs.”
A recent panel discussion entitled “Sex, Real Estate, and Power” took a look at this side of the issue, attempting to dissect the implications of the current system. 
Co-sponsored by HBOMB and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the discussion centered around the intersection between sexuality and space at Harvard. 
“We wanted to explore how power functions through sexuality in these spaces where people are owning the real estate, and to try to delve into the mystique of a lot of these social spaces,” said Colette S. Perold ’11, who moderated the panel.  
A SPACE OF ONE’S OWN
Yet while perspectives may differ, each of the current efforts to address the issue of social space at Harvard centers around the idea of awareness. 
According to Zogran, there are a number of existing spaces at Harvard that have the potential to become dynamic gathering places: they are just waiting to be recognized.  
A paticular existing social space that Zogran identified are the shuttle stops, which he described as “a really interesting network of social spaces that typically one doesn’t pay attention to.” 
In their lecture, Zogran and Kayden offered simple suggestions for altering the shuttle stops, which included adding elements such as building block seating, swings, and tether ball poles. 
So, next time you find yourself anxiously awaiting the morning shuttle at Currier to attend Ec10, just look around: you may just have all the space you need.

Much more was going on in the Malkin Athletic Center (MAC) this past weekend than your typical Pilates class. The men and women’s Intramural fencing tournament took place in the MAC fencing room—yes, there actually is one of those—where women and subsequently, men took a stab at one of the sports Harvard is actually good at (the varsity team just finished fifth in the nation). A variety of skill and experience levels were on display. While some competitors showed off consummate slicing and dicing skills, others more closely resembled two-year-olds with sticks.While some may describe fencing as a challenging mix between intricate strategy and mind games, Arnold P. Behrer ’09, competitor for Eliot House and fencing neophyte, took a slightly less complicated approach. “I’m just going out there and poking at the guy,” he said.“I’m pretty sure some of these girls are going to have bruises tomorrow,” said Caroline N. Vloka ’12, a member of the women’s varsity fencing team. They may have been suited up with what looked like a beekeeper’s helmet, a mix between a bulletproof vest and an apron, and one white glove à la Michael Jackson, but still “they were hitting pretty hard,” Vloka said.Up to four people from each house were allowed to compete, and the entire men’s and women’s varsity fencing teams showed up to support their amateur counterparts. In the end, Katherine E. Medina ’10 of Eliot House and Luke A. Leafgren, a tutor in Winthrop House, came out victorious.

Spring in Boston means one thing: baseball season. For non-natives, the Red Sox game ritual is a pre-graduation rite of passage. Don’t know how it works? Here’s a guide for Fenway Park first-timers who want to avoid looking like a pink hat (in baseball speak: a fair-weather poser Sox fan). First of all, anyone who goes to a game at Fenway should know some basic Sox history. Founded in 1901, the Boston Red Sox enjoyed several World Series Titles during their early years. After an 86-year dry period under The Curse of the Bambino—brought on by selling Babe Ruth to chief rivals, the New York Yankees­—the Sox finally found victory with World Series Championship wins in 2004 and 2007. Fenway Park, the home field, is known for the Green Monster, the highest left field wall in Major League Baseball.The season is pretty much sold out by now, so forget the box office. Unused tickets are released incrementally, so if you show up to Fenway in the early afternoon for a night game and wait in line, you can usually get some seats. If you don’t have an entire day to burn, however, then the best bet for your pocketbook is Craigslist.com, but if you prefer a guaranteed purchase, fans recommend StubHub.com as a slightly pricier alternative. Though bleachers offer the best deals, he next step up, the grandstand, is overpriced and suffers from obstructed views. Beware of Section 1: you’ll be shaded by the Budweiser sign, but all its massive support beams will be in the way. For those of you more interested in catching a fly baller than a fly ball, keep an eye out for third baseman and George Clooney doppelganger Mike A. Lowell. To get near the team’s most eligible bachelor, center fielder Jacoby M. Ellsbury, try the low-numbered bleachers for a great view of his bottom of the ninth. The day of the game, don’t bother going MBTA to get from Harvard to Fenway; You can take the M2 bus for free. You’ll have to Green Line it or take a cab coming back. Gates open two hours before game time. Go early and you can watch batting practice and snag some baseballs. Hang around the dugout and you might get an autograph. BYO sharpie. Alternatively, you can head to landmark bar The Cask & Flagon to pre-game. Alcohol smuggling is (not-so-strictly) prohibited in the ballpark, so plan accordingly. Food is always expensive, but you can get your hot dogs cheaper on Landsdowne Street just outside the park, and once you’re inside, you can still go out to Yawkey Way for seconds. Do it right and get a lot of toppings on there. Delicious. Once it’s game time, make sure you’re ready to yell. Fenway’s different from most other stadium; it’s intense and always sold-out. Don’t bring a book. That said, keep your comments positive. Insult the visiting team and you can make some very angry enemies. Backpedal and you risk receiving a harsh scolding from drunken Red Sox fans. Make sure to memorize Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” so you can belt it in the eighth inning. And if you don’t know any of the players’ names, just yell out “Go Rocco!” at some point and you’ll pass for a Fenway regular.Finally, don’t bring your glove if you’re over 10. The grief won’t be worth the help it might provide in the unlikely event that a ball heads your way. Now take yourself out to the ballgame. Your friends are going to be green (monsters) with envy.

It’s been four years since Jeffrey C. Witt ’09 stood under the floodlights in his hometown stadium, playing amid the raucous cries of 15,000 fans. 
Such a crowd was standard for the Georgia high school football championship game. Georgia is football country, and Witt, then a high school senior, led Parkville High School to its promised land. The college coaches were calling, had been calling for some time now. Stanford expressed interest, Dartmouth left messages, Harvard sent e-mails. A scholarship to some Division I institution seemed assured.            
Soon, e-mails became phone calls, official visits, thick envelopes. Witt chose to play in Cambridge, realizing that football could allow him access to a Harvard education. He would be the first person from his high school to attend Harvard: “Where I come from,” he says, “people didn’t even take Harvard seriously—not in an academic sense—but in the sense that it was never even mentioned that you could dream of going to Harvard.”  Witt laughs before recalling, “it was just kind of like a mythical land where geniuses inhabited the place.” Though he wasn’t expecting the sold-out stadiums and enormous hype of more high-profile Division I programs, he looked forward to the privileges of playing on the college level.

FIRST-RATE COMMITMENT, SECOND-RATE REWARDSWitt’s first Harvard football memory, however, would leave him disappointed. “My first game as a Harvard player was on the JV practice field against Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in front of about 12 people who were maybe relatives of the kids from WPI,” he says.  For a recruited athlete accustomed to a successful team and a devoted following, this was not the college homecoming that seemed to have been promised, ordained. “Literally the closest thing I can relate it to is when I first started playing football, when I was like six or seven” Witt explains. “We used to play on this kind of empty field that just had some lines on it. A couple of parents would come out and support the kids—that was essentially the way it felt to me.”
The rest of his freshman season was more of the same: he was assigned to scout duty, reduced to preparing the starters for real competition. Witt squeezed some playing time into a 55-7 win against Columbia in New York, but the coaching staff didn’t allow his right arm to make it into the scoring summary. During spring practices and into summer and preseason workouts, Witt started to get some more snaps, see some more reps, but it seemed somewhat in vain: two upperclassmen still stood solidly in the way. 
In a close game against Holy Cross, an injury to the quarterback prompted Witt’s entry—“thrust into the fray,” as he put it—“me, who had never really even been considered as a player.”  The Crimson went on to win, Witt threw for his first touchdown, and when his team arrived in Providence for a much-anticipated match-up against Brown, Witt was penciled in as starter. Things were looking up. Though Witt was the fifth Harvard player to start as quarterback in just 13 games, perhaps Harvard had finally found the quarterback of the future. Another win was imminent. Harvard had jumped out to a 31-7 lead. Witt threw another touchdown. In the second half, a Brown linebacker—who would later go on to win a Superbowl—sidelined Witt, tearing a ligament in his throwing shoulder. It was the last game he’d play as quarterback. “It wasn’t so long after that before it was the end of my career,” says Witt. 

THE PARADOX OF PROFESSIONALISM

It wasn’t the injury alone that prompted Witt’s departure. Football at Harvard was just not his brand of football. The lack of enthusiasm from students, the Ivy League restrictions, the impossibility of seeing an NCAA playoff spot: for Witt, it all led to a second-tier level of competition that was not reflected in the talent or devotion of the players themselves. 
These limiting factors, however, exist in stark contrast with the way Harvard Football conducts its business.  Harsh and demanding training regimens are paired with ambitious recruiting techniques.  For Witt, this translated into incompatibility. “I never felt comfortable as a Harvard football player,” he says, “I never felt that my talents were being utilized in any way, were given any opportunity to be shown. I basically just felt that I was relegated to the scout team immediately and I thought that was unfair, [it] certainly was a misrepresentation on the part of the coaches and how they recruited me.”  Furthermore, he says, “I felt like the training was a little bit ridiculous.”  Witt is quick to stress that he didn’t see this as a simple intensification from high school to college football: “the [high school] division I played in, it was very serious stuff. Not to blow it out of proportion, but it’s not like I came here shocked that people lifted weights and ran sprints.”  It wasn’t that the training was unbearable; it didn’t, however, match the atmosphere created by the Ivy League restrictions meant to reduce the game’s intensity.
Head football coach Tim Murphy estimates that the retention rate of recruited athletes over the past 15 years is about 70 percent. Even if this rate of attrition may be different in other sports, losing recruits once they are already on campus is an issue that resonates across the entire athletic department. Head softball coach Jenny Allard writes in an e-mail to The Crimson that students’ reasons for leaving vary: “Some students want the flexibility in their schedules to pursue other opportunities at Harvard.”  Others are injured. Some, like Witt, cannot accustom themselves to the fact that they are putting in a Division I level of commitment while receiving paltry payoffs in appreciation and success. In this sense, Harvard athletics seems to be caught in a no-man’s-land between the day to day reality of extreme competition and an official policy of amateurism. The question is, what happens to the casualties—the recruited athletes who can’t adjust to living in between? 
THE POLICY PLAYBOOK

In the fall of 1945, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Pennsylvania ratified the first “Ivy Group Agreement.” Dismayed at the encroachment of sponsorships and professional incentives into the supposedly amateur sphere of college athletics, these eight schools committed themselves to conducting their athletic programs “on a high plane consistent with academics.”
The decision came at a turning point in the history of the College. With the recent end of World War II came the GI Bill and a subsequent rush of veterans looking to complete their college educations. This was in addition to the regular set of high school seniors vying to enter the Yard. Facing the task of turning away an unprecedented number of applicants, the College was forced to review its admissions standards.
From these conditions emerged the modern-day athletic policy of Harvard. Yes, the administration decided, the College would actively seek athletes for its student body. Yes, it would strive to remain competitive with its peers. No, students would not receive athletic scholarships, but they would have the same opportunities as other needy students for financial aid.
Since these rules were implemented, the competition in both athletics and academics in American universities has intensified. According to a 2003 report by the NCAA, Division I-AA colleges, including Harvard, expanded annual athletics spending by ninety-one percent, from $3.94 million per school in 1993 to $7.53 million in 2003. The increase is dramatic even accounting for the rise of women’s sports during that period. A similar trend has occurred in academics. In 1993, the college accepted 15 percent of its applicants. Impressive by today’s standards, that rate is still more than twice the seven percent that was admitted into the class of 2013. 
Harvard’s athletic policy assumes that a university can have it all—competitive athletics and strong academics. However, given the high-pressure environments that both worlds have become, balancing the two can take a toll on student-athletes.  

RUNNING OUT OF BREATH

By the summer after junior year of high school, Elizabeth L. Altmaier ’10 had drafted a list of colleges that she wanted to play for. She intentionally avoided schools that offered athletic scholarships.
“Personal preference,” she says. “I don’t like the concept of signing yourself over to somebody.”
Altmaier flew out to Cambridge in September of her senior year and fell in love with Harvard’s academics and location. The choice became clear when a basketball player told her that her teammates would become her family. In a year, Altmaier found herself lacing up for practices with the women’s basketball team.  
Although she didn’t plan on continuing basketball after graduation, Altmaier fully expected it to be a significant part of her college experience.
“I had no intention at the time of not playing basketball for four more years,” she says.
In her first year at Harvard, Altmaier spent anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week with basketball. Practices even kept her from going home to California during vacations. But as the team fought its way out of a 1-10 start to the season to win an Ivy League title and a spot in the March Madness tournament, she found that it was worth it.
“I loved my teammates, and I was playing basketball,” Altmaier says. “That was about as much as I could ask for.”
But by her second year, the demands of the sport were beginning to wear her out. At the same time, Altmaier was still not getting the playing time that she wanted. She only played 28 minutes in her entire sophomore season. To watch others step onto the court and actually make use of their training can be bearable for a freshman, but disheartening for a sophomore struggling to justify the costs of a varsity sport. Altmaier recalls thinking about those elements of Harvard life in which she was missing out—the people, the extracurricular activities, the time to consider concentrations.   
“You don’t realize how you’re limited until you stop playing a sport,” she says. “The opportunity costs are huge.”
That point came earlier this school year when Altmaier was offered the chance to conduct genetics research that would lead to her officially co-authoring a paper. As a Human Evolutionary Biology concentrator interested in a career in science, the opportunity was irresistible. After spending a summer “emotionally exhausted,” talking to her roommates and parents, Altmaier decided that she couldn’t handle another year of basketball. The coaches understood her situation.
“It’s not unprecedented,” she says. “It has happened before.”
In fact, she was the second player in several weeks to leave the team, and at least one more would do the same in the upcoming season. A typical varsity basketball team only has 12 players; Harvard’s women’s squad currently has 10.

THE COACHES

Kathy Delaney-Smith, head coach of women’s basketball, refuses to characterize all athletes’ departures as “quitting.”
“I don’t ever call it quitting unless they’ve done it in the middle of the season, after they’ve made a commitment,” she says.
Instead, players and the coaching staff often reach this decision together. Sometimes a coach will actually encourage a player to drop the sport. Yet managing a team after losing a player remains a challenge. Recruiting plans must adjust, and remaining players are shifted around to fill gaps.
“If you plan for that, which I’m guessing most coaches do, you can survive it,” Delaney-Smith says.
Nonetheless, losing players is something to be avoided, and Harvard coaches face the especially difficult task of attracting and retaining athletes without the mechanism of the athletic scholarship. Whereas financial aid contingent upon athletic participation is a powerful incentive used by schools across the country, the ban on such scholarships in the Ivy League means that coaching staff must rely on other tactics.
According to Saretsky, it is crucial for an Ivy League coach to distinguish between the prospective students who are passionate about their sport and those who are “just trying to pad their resume.” Delaney-Smith also talks about discerning the level of “passion” in a prospective student-athlete.
“It’s certainly not a science,” she says. “I often will ask the question, ‘Can you see yourself not playing basketball?’ And then generally by their answer, I can get an opinion about their passion for the game.”
Despite its imperfections, coaches seem to prefer this method of recruiting over simply offering a sum of money.
“Having previously worked at a scholarship school, it is not a good feeling to go down to practice and know that some of the kids are just there because they are on scholarship and so they have to be there,” writes Jason Saretsky, director of track and field, in an e-mail to The Crimson.

THE PRODIGY
Halfway through the interview, Tomas Balcetis ’10, a star Lithuanian swingman, asks, “Sometimes I wonder how things would have turned out if I stayed, right?” 
Balcetis has long three-point stroking fingers, a quick beard, and perfect enunciation. He maneuvers around the vowels in “official visits” as if they are point guards playing defense. Years after his highly touted arrival on campus, the spring in his lanky frame is still visible, born of years of European training. 
In Lithuania, Balcetis explains, “we have academic schools and basketball schools.”  A product of the Sarunas Marciulionis Basketball Academy, named after the first Lithuanian player to go to the NBA, Balcetis also played for his country’s junior national team. Upon reaching high school age, however, he had not yet decided whether to focus on athletics or academics. So he moved to America. 
As a senior, Balcetis averaged 20 points a game for his private school in New Hampshire. He received offers from reputable programs such as Richmond and Duquesne. Stanford flew him out for an official visit, an honor in itself for such a competitive program, but ultimately couldn’t find room. In the end Balcetis came to Harvard, but he would never appear in an official game. 
“I always had this heart condition,” Balcetis explains. Realizing how shocking this can sound, he hurriedly adds, “first of all, it’s really nothing serious. I don’t want to alarm anyone.”  He had ignored the condition for years but the transition to college prompted another chance to consider his options.“The reason I chose Harvard was because I wasn’t really sure how far I could go with basketball when I got into college,” he says. “When I got into Harvard, you know, it was like I should definitely give it a try, but after a long decision-making process I decided to stop doing it because if it’s not 100% then there’s no reason to do it at all.”   
In an interview with The Crimson shortly after quitting, Balcetis said something similar: “...when the level of basketball increases, the workload increases, so it’s kind of hard to sometimes go 100%, and college basketball is all 100% or nothing.” 
More than two years later, Balcetis says, “I didn’t see the reason to not go 100% all the time.”  Balcetis’ quotes are fixated on this elusive 100%, as if childhood basketball is maybe 50%, high school ball 80%, never reaching the highest level until college. “It’s a pre-professional step in your basketball career—that definitely affected my decision,” he says.
Waving one hand in the air, he adds, “I still obviously play a lot of basketball on my own time—I try to keep in shape—but it’s definitely because of, you know, this high level. College basketball is definitely high level. Some people think that Ivy League is not high level. Let them come to some of the practices.”

A GOOD MODEL
The troubles of student-athletes can often be traced to the recruiting period, when promising high school students see Harvard as an opportunity to pursue both academic and athletic prospects. In an effort to attract top talent, coaches may paint the picture of college athletics as being rosier than it actually is. However, even with full disclosure and the best of intentions on the part of coaches, the information gap remains large for the 17- or even 16-year-olds deciding whether or not to play college sports.  
“How do you judge? You have no idea because you’re not in college, and you’re not in college athletics,” Altmaier says. “You really don’t know what your criteria are for making you happy.”
It is perhaps precisely at these moments, when students’ expectations are dashed by long hours on the bench and problem sets on rides back from away games, that Harvard’s refusal of athletic scholarships becomes most beneficial. The attitudes behind such policies may also be increasingly necessary. In a 2006 study, sixty-two percent of Division I student-athletes reported viewing themselves more as athletes than students, despite the NCAA’s official stance that “[i]ntercollegiate athletics programs shall be maintained as a vital component of the educational program,” not the other way around. 
But why the fixation on athletics? What makes sacrificing classes for 20 hours of practice each week any different from 20 hours at rehearsal or, for that matter, any non-academic use of a student’s time? Josephine R. Potuto, a co-author of the 2006 study, is a law professor at the University of Nebraska and the chair of the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions. An outspoken critic of the escalation in college athletics, Potuto points out that unlike with any other activity, the university itself plays a dominating role in taking students away from their studies.
“I think it’s different [to] institutionalize it than if that student had the extra time and just played video games,” she says.
Potuto does believe that a school can have both competitive teams and consistently challenging academics. However, the situation is also a zero-sum game, and high standards in one will necessarily require some forfeit in the other.
“When you go to a school with very rigorous admissions requirements, you know what you’re getting into as a coach,” she says.
And despite the jokes about Ivy League sports, Harvard does consistently put out nationally ranked teams. Regardless of official policies, Division I membership fosters Division I drive and, consequently, Division I pressure. The coaches unequivocally stated that academics come first, but the balance is particularly delicate at Harvard, requiring constant communication between athletes, coaching staff, and faculty. This is especially true when the cold reality of playing a sport begins to obscure the lofty principles that the university declares. According to Saretsky, the track and field team has gone as far as rearranging flights for students to meet the demands of their classes. Yet coaches also agree with this ranking of priorities.
“I think Harvard is the model,” Delaney-Smith says. “The country should be doing what Harvard is doing.”
Perhaps a good model doesn’t have to work for everyone. Inevitably, there will injuries, dissatisfaction with playing time, development of other interests. Rather, what makes a model good is that it allows those people to drop out at a minimal cost when things go wrong. Not that the decision to leave is ever easy, but entering a life after sports at Harvard is certainly feasible. According to Katherine C. “Kacey” Wilson ’10, a former cross country runner who left after her freshman year, it can even be revitalizing.
“Running was integral to my identity in high school,” she says. “It was interesting to lose that, and I really enjoyed reconstructing myself.”

LIFE AFTER SPORTS
The end of Altmaier’s basketball career hasn’t resulted in idle time. In addition to her genetics research, she is currently involved with the Entrepreneurship Forum, managing their annual I3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge. This summer, she will be working as a summer analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, a position she discovered at one of the OCS panels that she had the time to attend now that she was done with basketball.
“These types of things are always, inevitably scheduled at the same time as practice,” she says. “You can’t go. There’s no possibility.”
Though her plans after college are unclear, Altmaier expresses interest in biotechnology. Because getting a job may be tough in the current economy, she is also considering graduate school.
“I’m trying to take things one step at a time,” she says. 
For Witt, things moved quickly after football. “I quit on like a Monday or a Tuesday,” he recalls. That Wednesday, he tried out for common casting and won a role. The shock of the abrupt shift from the gridiron to the stage was not lost on Witt: “If I were to say here at Harvard, ‘Oh, I’m in a play this semester,’ people would say, ‘Whoa, that’s fantastic, that’s so cool.’ Were I to say that back in high school people would be like, ‘Oh, big deal.’” Witt laughs, “It’s funny to compare the two worlds, one world turned on its head.”  
Going out into the real world next year, Witt has been accepted into a fellowship in politics in which he’ll be splitting time between Colorado and Washington, D.C. He also had an offer to return to the Wall Street firm where he interned last summer. Eventually he wants to go to law school. 
And at least one student plans to translate his sports backgound into a career. Before the interview, Balcetis lays his phone carefully on its side on the radiator next to him.  He doesn’t mention it until the discussion turns to careers and the future.  He grins and points at the phone, saying, “I’m trying to actually get a job with the NBA.  I’m actually waiting for a call right now, as we speak, with the Player Development Group.  Sports entertainment, sports marketing, things like that.”  He leaves the phone where it is, adding, “I definitely want to stay as involved as possible with basketball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Public Schools will receive $1.2 million for special education programs and $760,000 for high poverty schools over the next two years as part of the Obama administration’s economic stimulus package. About 80 percent of the stimulus plan, which was announced in February, has been allotted for education. The funds that Cambridge will receive come from two sources: the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which supports special education initiatives, and Title I, the portion of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that addresses the needs of disadvantaged students. Cambridge is currently budgeted to spend $28.2 million on special education programs in total for the 2009-10 school year and already receives about $2 million in Title I funds.
Although the district was notified of these figures earlier this month, it will not actually receive the money until July.
According to Claire B. Spinner, the chief financial officer for Cambridge Public Schools, the application forms for these grants which the district must fill out to receive the funding have not yet been released. She added that the spending and reporting regulations will be very stringent, and that the money can only be used for specific purposes.
The district has not determined exactly what it plans to do with the stimulus money, although Spinner said the funds, which are expected to be temporary, should not be used to create programs or hire personnel that will need to be sustained for longer than two years. 
School committee member Alfred B. Fantini, who said that this money “can’t be used to substitute budget problems,” added that he believes the funds will probably go to non-recurring costs such as professional development and training. 
Marc C. McGovern, another school committee member, said that he would like to see the stimulus money pay to place social workers in schools, if possible.
Fantini said that he is “pleased” that most of the funding will be devoted to improving special education, the area in the district that he considers most in need of improvement.
“That’s exactly where I would put extra money,” he said, adding that he hopes providing more training for teachers will enable special needs students to be integrated into city schools.
While McGovern agreed that the additional funding will be helpful, he also said that the district will need to address non-financial challenges in special education as well.
“I want us to be more proactive, I want us to be more consumer friendly,” he said. “We need to have a serious conversation about what kind of system we want to be. I think that will go as far as any dollar.”

Less than three months after leaving Harvard for Washington, U.S. Solicitor General and former Law School dean Elena Kagan will return to Cambridge as the Law School’s 2009 Class Day speaker.Kagan, who served as the Law School’s dean until confirmed as a member of President Barack Obama’s administration last month, was selected by this year’s Class Marshals to address the Law School’s graduating J.D. students on June 3.“It was an obvious choice for us,” said Class Marshal and third year Law School student Bridgette L. Hylton. “She has had such a huge impact on the Law School, and we felt it was a nice way to wrap up our time here.”In some circles, Kagan is considered one of the most influential law school deans in recent memory.Upon her departure for the Solicitor General’s office, Kagan left a legacy of reform, through which she spearheaded the Law School’s effort to reinvent the student experience. Compared to other top-tier schools, Harvard had sometimes been perceived as overly competitive and unwelcoming to its student body—an image Kagan worked to help the Law School shed since assuming the deanship in 2003.As dean, the student-friendly initiatives Kagan promoted ranged from free coffee in the renovated Harkness Center to a revamp of the J.D. curriculum, which was the most significant overhaul in over 100 years. Kagan also presided over a significant expansion of the faculty, picking up numerous illustrious scholars from rival institutions. Among the Law School’s student body, Kagan enjoyed great popularity, and when she was passed over for the post of university president in 2007, hundreds of students wearing “I (Heart) EK” shirts celebrated the continuation of her deanship.Hylton said many students had hoped Kagan would participate in the ceremonies, asking if she might be available to hand out diplomas to the new graduates.The news that their former dean had been asked to participate in their commencement—albeit in an unexpected way—still generated excitement among the student body.“It’s kind of weird, but she’s solicitor general now, so that’s a big deal,” said third-year Law School student Todd M. Blodgett, who called Kagan one of the best professors he had encountered in his time at Harvard.And while a few students admitted they had hoped for a “celebrity” after Secretary of Energy Steven Chu was announced as the Commencement keynote speaker, others said they were happy to have Kagan give them a final send-off.“She’s a good speaker,” said third-year Law School student Stephanie M. Early. “It’s a nice way to recognize her, and I’ll be glad to hear her speak.”—Staff writer Athena Y. Jiang can be reached at ajiang@fas.harvard.edu.

Yesterday afternoon, close to 180 people gathered in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics to discuss art and politics with Carlos Fuentes, and internationally renowned Latin-American literary giant known particularly for his novels. Carlos Fuentes served as Mexico’s ambassador to France from 1975 to 1977 and was appointed Harvard University’s first Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professor of Latin American Studies in 1987. Fuentes, who has taught at many prestigious institutions and currently teaches at Brown University, addressed the audience with frankness and humor. In a conversation with Maria Hinojosa, the host of National Public Radio’s Latino USA, he discussed the need for a bilateral effort for peace between Mexico and the United States. He also mentioned the importance of the arts in directing progress for the Mexican nation.Openly confronting the issues of immigration and drug wars in Mexico, Fuentes stated that it must be a joint effort between Mexico and the United States. He pointed to democracy in eliminating the violence and drug wars ravaging Mexico.“How you punish and avoid corruption is the real question. Can democracy limit corruption?” Fuentes asked.As he called for a “new deal for Mexico” and a social contract that would renew the nation and clear up corruption. Fuentes emphasized that literature and education were essential in this push for progress. Students who attended the discussion agreed with Fuentes’ statement on the role of art in politics.“I’m an artist myself, concerned with the politics in my own country, Singapore,” said Judith S.Y. Huang ’09. “Fuentes understands the difficulty of this endeavor. He understands the methods of both art and politics. You need art in society to point out what needs to be heard.”Literature, Fuentes said, becomes timeless not from its message, but from the quality and imagination that is contained in it. He stated that whatever the political situation in a country, it is the caliber of the imagination and language in literature that creates the condition out of which another literary creation will emerge. He said that art presents the problems of the country to the readers or the viewers, and that it is this explicit awareness that art brings that stimulates progress. “It is when we become comfortable and forget to fight for freedom that we run into problems,” Fuentes said. “This kind of event and being able to host such an influential speaker is very important, first of all, for the Latin-American community at Harvard,” said Christopher J. Hollyday ’11, one of the Forum staff. “And it is also important for Mexican-American relations, as we move forward into our future. These issues affect us.”

Former Commanding General of the Iraq Multi-National Force David H. Petraeus spoke before a packed audience at the Harvard Institute of Politics last night, before heading to the Charles Hotel to honor student veterans at a lavish dinner celebration.
Petraeus took the stage at the IOP following a lengthy introduction, which included a presentation of flags by the Harvard ROTC Color Guard as well as speeches from Harvard Center for Public Leadership Director David R. Gergen, Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood, and student veterans Maura C. Sullivan and Seth W. Moulton. 
When Petraeus took the stage, he responded to questions from Gergen and used Powerpoint slides to demonstrate various trends in the war effort. 
In his speech, the general emphasized the importance of reevaluating strategy and communicating these new goals to leaders. He said that before the successful 2007 troop surge in Iraq, he and his advisors “sat down and tried to get the big ideas right.” 
Petraeus also noted the importance of reaching out to the enemy in order to help ensure peace. 
“You can’t kill or capture your way out of an industrial strength insurgency,” he said. “You have to promote reconciliation.” 
When the floor was opened for questions, many audience members asked Petraeus about the possibility of a troop surge in Afghanistan. The general said that while he believed that progress could be achieved, he knew that the conflict would certainly escalate with a troop increase.
“It will be very difficult and you won’t see the dramatic downturn that we have seen in Iraq,” he said. 
After the forum concluded with a standing ovation for student veterans, audience members were met by a small group of protestors outside the IOP, who held up signs with slogans such as “Petraeus is a murderer.” One demonstrator, who preferred to be known only as Terrance, said he was protesting because he wanted to support peace and free thought. 
“I came today because I don’t believe in war,” he said. “I came today because I believe there’s a better way to figure things out.”
Petraeus, meanwhile, joined many of the forum attendees for a dinner at the Charles Hotel Ballroom to honor veterans from the Harvard Kennedy, Business, and Law Schools. The event—held for the third consecutive year—was attended by several hundred students and faculty, and included a steak dinner and a prayer from Reverend Peter J. Gomes. 
Taking the podium again for his keynote speech, Petraeus cracked jokes about Princeton and Yale before honoring the former servicemen in attendance. 
Calling these young veterans the “new greatest generation,” Petraeus said, “I am simply here to say to each of you: thank you.”
The event then concluded with a round of toasts to the many divisions of the United States military, as well as to those who died in battle. 
Harvard Business School student Leo V. Buehler, who served three tours in Iraq, said he was humbled and impressed by the event. 
“I think this event has shown that the community here is very supportive of the men and women who serve,” he said.

Fiscal belt-tightening measures in College and House libraries have hurt the job prospects of students looking for employment among the stacks.As the Houses contend with a University mandate to cut their budgets by 25 percent, some libraries are preferentially hiring students on work-study, whose wages are subsidized by the federal government. In Kirkland, for example, though applications poured in earlier this year—according to Kirkland House library tutor Allison K. Rone ’06, about 60 students applied—the House could not afford to accommodate as many undergraduates who did not qualify for federal work-study as in past years. All the Kirkland undergraduates who were newly hired this year to work in the library participate in federal work-study. The number of library employees has also fallen from 13 to 10.“It’s been the most prominent cost-cutting initiative visible in the House,” said Kirkland library supervisor Joshua C. Feblowitz ’09.Before the University began mandating sweeping budget cuts across its constituent schools, the central library system paid these students, but now, the Houses’ budgets foot the bill, Rone said. She said this has forced her to reduce students’ hours and has prevented her from raising their pay. The Kirkland library has also had to slash 20 hours of service a week, according to Rone, and is now closed on Fridays. The cutbacks have made Kirkland House Masters Tom and Verena Conley “angry,” Rone said.Quincy House has reduced the need for student library employees by instituting an electronic swipe access system.In the Mather House library, students are still hired based on merit rather than financial considerations, according to library tutor Joseph S. Ronayne ’92, but the number of salaried library personnel may be pared down in the future.College libraries outside the Houses have had to take similar steps to cut costs.“We will have to reduce our budget by 15 percent and plan for an additional 16 percent reduction over the next two fiscal years,” Harvard College Library spokeswoman Beth Brainard said.Much like Kirkland library, the Quad library has given work-study students priority, according to Chika A. Okoro ’11. Okoro is on the advisory board of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, where the Quad library is located.She said that the hiring restrictions made the employment process more difficult, as the library is “barely staffed as it is.” —Staff writer Bita M.

A female graduate student was allegedly attacked with a metal pipe while walking in the Science Center Plaza at approximately 12:20 a.m. yesterday, according to a community advisory e-mail issued by the Harvard University Police Department. The attack was allegedly part of an attempted armed robbery. According to the advisory, the student was leaving Harvard Yard through Thayer Gate, walking between Memorial Hall and Cambridge Street, when the perpetrator attempted to take her purse. The student was hit on the head with the metal pipe and sustained some minor injuries.She evaded the alleged suspect by running away, and has since been treated at a local hospital, according to the advisory.The alleged victim was unable to provide a description of her attacker. The incident is under investigation, according to the HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.All students, faculty, and staff of Harvard’s Cambridge campus and some at the Longwood campus received notification of the incident yesterday afternoon in the form of a community advisory e-mail issued by the HUPD, according to Catalano.The e-mail is the first of its kind to be sent out this calendar year. According to the HUPD website, “The HUPD disseminates community advisories and crime alerts after a serious or violent crime that may pose a continuing public safety threat is reported to the HUPD or local police departments.” The department sends advisories directly to Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as well as the deans of the schools, department public affairs officers, and the Director of News and Public Affairs for the University. They also ask representatives to post the advisories in conspicuous locations on campus in addition to electronically forwarding them widely to students, faculty and staff. Prior to yesterday, the last advisory to be sent out was on September 22, 2008, which warned of a third incident in a series of thefts last September.Since 2007, only nine such community advisories have been issued by the police department.—Staff writer Emily J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Buds and blossoms aren’t the only things sprouting up around Harvard Square in April—many local businesses are also greening up to celebrate Earth Day today. Nearby restaurants, stores, and hotels are unveiling initiatives to help minimize their impact on the environment, such as recycling, composting, and reducing energy usage.
“Being green is a way of life in Harvard Square,” said Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise Jillson.
Store and restaurant owners reported that green initiatives—such as energy and waste reduction—are on the rise, both for altruistic and profit-related motives. Since being environmentally-friendly decreases energy costs and also serves as a marketing tool, business owners said that the commitment to going green is actually helping them see more green in today’s harsh economic climate.
A WAY OF LIFE
Origins, a wellness-based beauty brand with a full line of plant-based skin-care, makeup, and body care products, kicked off its Return to Origins Recycling Program at the beginning of this month. The Brattle Street branch, along with other retail locations across the country, is collecting customers’ empty cosmetic containers to be recycled or burned to produce electricity.
Prior to this initiative, Origins had recycled their own packaging but had never accepted all empty cosmetic containers regardless of brand.
“There’s no other cosmetic company around doing something like this,” said store manager Mark Leonard.
Throughout the month of April, the company—in partnership with environmental awareness organization Global ReLeaf—will also plant a tree for every jar of A Perfect World Antioxidant moisturizer that Origins sells.
Although these programs were implemented in honor of Earth Month, Leonard said that Origins’ green initiatives are part of a broader commitment to the environment. According to the company’s Web site, all Origins products are manufactured using renewable resources, wind energy, and earth-friendly practices, using recycled materials wherever possible.
Though eco-friendly business practices such as those employed by Origins are becoming increasingly popular, especially during Earth Month, many store and restaurant owners said that their joints have functioned under those principles for a long time, and that their environmental interests were not temporary initiatives, but ongoing ones.
SERVING UP “GREENS”
Harvard Square restaurants, for example, are implementing environmentally-friendly initiatives and minimizing their carbon footprint by recycling, composting, and reducing energy usage.
Though restaurants naturally consume a large quantity of water and energy and produce both organic and inorganic waste, several local food services establishments said that they are making green changes.
On Winthrop Street, UpStairs on the Square co-owner Mary-Catherine Deibel said that her restaurant is always on the lookout for ways to implement environmental practices. The establishment—known for its eye-popping girly décor, well-reviewed dishes and high menu prices—is a member of the Green Restaurant Association, a national non-profit organization that promotes sustainability in the industry.
Besides ongoing efforts to use local produce and reduce energy usage, UpStairs began offering in-house filtered water last month as an alternative to the imported water it usually serves. Bottled water is still offered on the menu, but Deibel said the response to the filtered water alternative has been “very positive.”
Deibel said that the restaurant’s eco-consciousness stems mostly out of a genuine concern for the environment, but that the establishment’s green status also motivates the staff and the boosts business. “People like to eat in places that are responsible,” she said.
A few months ago, the restaurant also made an adjustment to how private events and functions are hosted. Instead of giving a disposable menu to each customer, the restaurant now only prints a menu for every two diners, slashing its paper usage in half.
Many of its environmental initiatives—such as purchasing new energy-efficient equipment or compact fluorescent light bulbs—may not be profitable at first, but Deibel said that those measures save money in the long run due to decreased energy usage over time.
Although Veggie Planet—a casual vegetarian restaurant a few blocks away on Palmer Street—offers a very different dining experience, its commitment to the environment is similar.
The restaurant has no specific initiatives for Earth Month, but co-owner Adam Penn said that Veggie Planet will be working with Cambridge Local First—a network of locally-owned businesses—in the next month to conduct an environmental audit to assess its practices. Penn said that the restaurant currently composts and recycles, and its vegetarian menu is good for the environment, since less water, land, and energy are used than for meat production.
Penn said since customers are becoming increasingly eco-conscious, businesses are following suit.
“There are some business owners who really do care about the environment, but there are plenty of the others who see it as an opportunity to market themselves,” said Penn, adding that he did not disapprove of businesses selling themselves as green.
“It’s great that doing what’s good for the environment is good for business as well,” he said.
For a store with walls covered in grass, it’s not a surprise that JP Licks is also attempting to be eco-conscious, recycling its ice cream containers and making a push for travel mugs rather than disposable paper cups. Since last fall, customers who buy a coffee refill with the travel mug—which costs $2.99 from the store—is charged the price of a small coffee despite the mug’s medium size.
Jason D. Provost, the store’s general manager, said that the travel mug initiative has not only reduced paper waste, but has also boosted business. Despite charging less for refills, coffee sales have risen, compensating for the decreased price. Provost also said that the store has seen “absolutely no drop in profit.”
“Going green has become so popular, and showing customers that we do make an effort is good for us,” said Provost.
But customer Andreea D. Gorbatai, a third year GSAS student, said that she doubted the initiative’s environmental efficacy, since many people forget to carry the mugs.
“It shows that they care about the environment,” said Gorbatai. “But I don’t know if it will have an impact.”
GREEN SLEEPS
In a city full of camera-ready landmarks, eco-conscious travelers can also now find greener places to lodge. 
Accommodations around the Square are launching initiatives in time for Earth Month, as well as implementing changes as an ongoing effort to be more environmentally friendly.
Rachael Solem, the owner of the Irving House and Harding House, two nearby bed and breakfasts with long-standing green initiatives, said that there was a close relationship between her own philosophy regarding the environment and the way she conducts her businesses.
“Personally, I am willing to make some sacrifices and invest some money in order to have a light environmental footprint,” Solem said, adding that she drives a hybrid car, uses reusable shopping bags, and tries to take public transportation whenever possible.
Solem said that although a hotel’s operation entails a fairly high use of resources—since clean rooms must be maintained every day—her establishments make efforts to be Earth-friendly by composting leftover food; offering disposable, compostable, and biodegradable plates and cups; and using paper products made from 100 percent recycled content.
Rather than giving guests individual bottles of bath amenities like many other hotels, Solem’s bed and breakfasts buy shampoo, lotion, and soap in bulk and offer them in refillable dispensers.
Solem also said that being environmentally friendly supersedes the desire to maximize profit, a viewpoint unique among the businesses owners contacted. The two establishments are looking into installing solar thermal panels to heat water, a technology that would require a 30-year payback period while needing replacement every 15 years. Though the solar thermal panels would not be cost-effective, Solem said that she will probably install them anyway in order to support the industry and promote their use.
“I’m willing to spend the money because it’s the right thing to do,” she said.
On the other end of the luxury spectrum, The Charles Hotel in Harvard Square is also taking steps to promote the environment by granting parking discounts to compact cars, installing a “juice bar” in the garage to charge hybrid and electric cars for free, and offering guests a complimentary bike program.
“Being environmentally friendly has been part of our philosophy since our inception,” said Alex Attia, the hotel’s general manager.
AN ONGOING PROCESS
A common theme expressed by owners of various businesses—regardless of the extent of efforts made by the store—was that their environmental initiatives were works-in-progress.
Mary Catherine Deibel of UpStairs on the Square said that “little by little,” the restaurant is working to reduce energy usage, and hopes to begin composting this year.
The Harvard Square Business Association’s Jillson, who helped organize the “Great Big Green Party” that will take place this Friday in Winthrop Park to raise awareness about environmental issues, called the green movement a “daily process.”
“It’s never enough, is it?” reflected Jillson. “But we’re really trying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Olena Hankivsky, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada joined an intimate group of undergraduates and graduate students for a discussion about the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender and class in health research and social policy yesterday.The informal session was organized by Laurie A. Nsiah-Jefferson, a lecturer on Women, Gender and Sexuality, who teaches courses on race and gender. Nsiah-Jefferson said that she invited Hankivsky to Harvard after hearing her talk about her work at a conference a year ago. “I drew a lot of my inspiration [for my class] from Olena,” she said. “I really wanted students, faculty, and staff to hear her perspective on intersectionality and be able to talk about it from the policy as well as research perspective.”Hankivsky, who is also the founder and co-director of Institute for Critical Studies of Gender and Health, said that the concept of intersectionality should also be applied to health research and social policy, not just the social sciences and the humanities.She spoke about intersectionality as an all-encompassing approach that weaves together factors such as gender, class, race, and other determinants of health to help scholars better understand public health problems and enable them to better craft long-term solutions.But Hankivsky said that she commonly encounters resistance to this approach from other researchers who believe that it is too ambiguous to be applied to practical research questions.“Everyone acknowledges that intersectionality is on the table,” Hankivsky said. “But in the same breath they say there needs to be a pragmatism to research.”Hankivsky co-authored a recently released primer by the Women’s Health Research Network entitled “Intersectionality: Moving Women’s Health Research and Policy Forward,” which she likened to an “Intersectionality for Dummies” guide for health researchers, scholars, and policy makers who want to apply the paradigm to their work.  Candance B. Samuel ’12, who attended the event, said that she enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about the research process.“It’s helped me connect the dots more with what I’m learning in school and as it applies to actual research in public health. So it was very informative,” she said.

Holland Cotter ’70, an art critic for the New York Times, received the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism on Monday at Columbia University. Cotter received his award for four articles about art in China, which he wrote during a trip there last summer before the 2008 Summer Olympics.Awarded since 1970, The Pulitzer Prize for Criticism honors “distinguished criticism, in print or online,” according to the Pulitzer Web site.Cotter has been on staff at the New York Times since 1998, focusing on the New York City arts scene and non-western art.   While a student at Harvard, he studied English literature and was an editor for the Advocate.A native of Boston, the journalist said that he was raised in a family that loved music, books, and art. As a teenager in the sixties, Cotter said that he was heavily influenced by a combination of Boston’s strong Asian art collections and the culturally pioneering times. Cotter said he knew that he wanted to study literature at Harvard, specifically with renowned American poet Robert Lowell. As a freshman in 1966, Cotter enrolled in Lowell’s graduate seminar.The first art course Cotter took was a result of him seeking to fulfill a science requirement. He enrolled in a “primitive art” class in the Anthropology Department that was cross-registered with the Art History Department. It was this course that introduced him to the Peabody Museum, where he spent much of his time as an undergraduate.After college, Cotter ended up in New York City where he first worked on The New York Arts Journal, a quarterly that covered all areas of art, from the fine arts to fiction. His articles were noticed by Art in America, and a job there eventually led to another at the New York Times. “It wasn’t anything I set out as a career path for myself,” Cotter said of his career as an art critic. “It was something I enjoyed and that became the main thing that I do.”During the 1970s, at the onset of Cotter’s journalistic career, most articles about non-western art centered on their sale value and not on their merit, according to Suzanne P. Blier, a professor of fine art and African and African American studies.Cotter became known for his articles covering non-western art forms in a serious and intellectual manner, she said.“He’s a man of extraordinary brilliance and compassion with an intellectual wingspan that covers the globe.”Cotter was hesitant to take full credit for the adulation that his work has received.“I don’t consider it a prize to one person,” he said. “It is a prize to the journalism community and the New York Times in general.”But Blier insisted that the award rightfully honors Cotter’s contributions to the art world. “It says that the arts he covers are worthy of and indeed demand a sort of intellectual rigor and a provocative in-depth analysis that he brings to bear on them,” she said.

Is a mountain of books eclipsing the light at the end of the tunnel? We might be getting down to the wire, but with the last onslaught of projects and papers, there’s still a risk of collapsing before you reach that elusive finish line.
For students who’ve been breathing in the stale smell of the Widener stacks instead of the fresh April breezes, the Harvard College Women’s Center and the Seneca have got the perfect cure for home-stretch burnout.
More details after the jump.
The Harvard College Women’s Center and the Seneca are hosting a “Recharge Night” tonight, complete with facials, massages, yummy noshes like cheese, chocolate, and fruit, and--because FlyBy knows you seek to return to a more carefree state--arts and crafts!
The free event takes place from 7-9 p.m. in the Women’s Center, but just be warned before you start ranting loudly about your ridiculous last-minute assignment to the masseuse. The event, which is “designed to help students and teachers relax and recharge,” just might draw your professors, too.

Time flies, doesn't it?  A mere hour ago, the distinguished Barry S. Kane, FAS Registrar extraordinaire, sent his first email of the semester.  The implications, of course, are clear: the semester is over, another year has passed, and you better fill out your Q Guide or prepare to get bumrushed, KGB-style.
Well, the administration has yet to take those sorts of drastic measures to raise the 74% (pretty impressive) response rate.  But, if you happen to have a have a from: Barry Kane, to: trash email filter, you might want to perk up.  The Registrar has finally learned the power of incentives.
Details, post-jump:
According to the email:
Bravo Barry--FlyBy has only been waiting on this one for years.  But oh, will it work. Can we set an over/under on the participation rate this time?  Has to be at least 98%, no?  All those people you know who claim to not want to see their grades will be the first ones logging in to fill this out.
However, has the Registrar deeply considered the ramifications of this?  On margin, those extra 26% who refuse to fill out the Q are the hardest of hard core holdouts.  They set up Barry Kane filters, they refuse the appeals of such campus luminaries as Matt L. Sundquist '09, Sangu J. Delle '10, and Clifton G. Dawson '07, and don't even care enough for their future brethren to lower that fanatic-inflated overall rating on that small seminar class.  These free-riders just refused to care enough...until now.
But what will these lowly moochers do?  Destroy the sanctity of the ratings, that's what.  FlyBy envisons races for the fastest completed Q evaluations, a spike in "not applicable" selections from students who only showed up for the midterms, and a full slate of empty comment boxes (now, instead of 35% of the class taking the time to call lectures boring, it'll be 20%).
But oh well, FlyBy has already decided to boycott the guide anyway--bring back the books!

Did you miss the Lady Gaga concert in March? Not to fret, because our new favorite diva is coming back to Boston to perform with Kelly Clarkson at the House of Blues on May 3rd. The best part? the concert is FREE! That's right, a free concert with both Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson. Its like pop music Heaven. There's only one teeny weeny catch--you have to own a Sidekick to get tickets.
Now we bet you wish you didn't buy that iPhone and/or Blackberry, huh? See the details about the show after the jump.
So it turns out that the only way to get tickets for this Lady Gaga-Kelly Clarkson double header is through T-mobile. Starting April 20th they are giving tickets (which are free, remember?)  away at two locations--the T-mobile store at 375 Washington Street in Boston and the store at South Shore Plaza in Braintree. But beware-- in order to get a ticket you have to either own a Sidekick already, buy one, or play some kind of game (we hear ring toss is popular).
So it looks like it may be time to join the hordes of teenage girls all across the country and purchase a Sidekick.
For more information, see the story from The Boston Phoenix.
