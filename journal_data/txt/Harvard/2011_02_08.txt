After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This month, actor Channing Tatum stars as a soldier yet again in “The Eagle,” a film adaptation of Rosemary Sutcliff’s 1854 Roman-era historical novel “The Eagle of the Ninth.” Though Tatum is best known for his portrayals of military men, his career is anything but uniform. With a resume that boasts everything from a romantic lead in the dance phenomenon “Step Up” to this year’s comedic role in Ron Howard’s “The Dilemma”—as well as personal producing credits—Tatum is more than a pretty face and a buff exterior. While the actor claims that there is no “rhyme or reason” to the films he chooses, in a roundtable interview with The Crimson he said that he is eager for diverse experiences and unafraid to fail in unusual roles. He spoke at length about the challenges he faces in his ever-expanding repertoire—challenges which included getting into a soldier’s mindset, acting in computer-generated imagery (CGI) environments, and performing comedy alongside Vince Vaughn.
The Harvard Crimson: For “Stop-Loss,” your 2008 Iraq war film, you’ve said that you had a lot of trouble playing a soldier. Does that still happen to you now?
Channing Tatum: Yeah. At the time I felt false and phony—and it’s kind of our job to not feel that way. What a soldier does, I think, is the most noble thing that you can do, no matter what your politics are, and I just felt really scared to kind of say that [I’d] ‘done’ these things. I’ve been in a fistfight, but I have never been shot at or had things blown up around me.
THC: You’ve said that having this role in “The Eagle” was one of your childhood dreams. Did it live up to your expectations?
CT: Yeah, in so many different ways. You really get a glimpse for a second of what it really was like, even though it’s a movie. There was one take that we did that was about a minute and a half long, and it was just a melee. We were losing the light so we shot until we ran out of film. I could not breathe afterwards, it was so exhausting. But [historically] these guys fought weeks at a time, sometimes months. They would march, then they would build, then they would fight—then they would march and build and fight more. I really don’t know how they did it. I wish I could say that I was that tough. I would have never been able to do it. They were just different men back then.
THC: When you played a soldier in “G.I. Joe,” that film had a lot of CGI, while in “The Eagle,” all the battle scenes had real extras. How do you compare working with real actors to working with computer graphics?
CT: I mean, the stuff in “G.I. Joe,” it’s hard to understand. You’re in a half-built pod and they’re like, “Lean left!” “Lean right!” “Missile blows up!” “Shoot now!” and they just give you directions like that. I like hand-to-hand combat. It’s just so much more tactile and you can feel like you’re really in it. [Some of the action scenes in “The Eagle”] were maybe the most fun I’ve had on a movie set ever. But there are other opportunities, I think, coming down the road, that CGI will [make] just as fun, because you can really stretch the world of reality.
THC: Did director Ron Howard give you total freedom for your comedic role, Zip, in “The Dilemma?”
CT: You know, there was a lot freedom. I remember I auditioned over Skype. I was in New York shooting a little independent movie and I hear that Ron Howard wants to Skype with me and I’m like, “What does he want to Skype for?” They sent [the script for] “The Dilemma.” I felt weird about doing a scene ... so I just kind of made up a character and riffed into the camera a little bit. His only note was, “a little less high.” I was like, “alright, deal.” I’ve never been more extremely, convulsively nervous to go into a rehearsal period, because people don’t call me for funny. They just don’t. And to go in with Ron Howard and Vince Vaughn—two of the most talented people at what they do—was a nerve-wracking experience.
THC: In interviews and blogs, you’ve mentioned how you’ve explored different areas like acting, modeling, and writing. Do you have any advice for the younger generation trying to figure out what it is they want to do?
CT: Just do it. I heard Spike Jones talk on a panel, and this young filmmaker stood up and said, “do you have any advice for young filmmakers?” And he was like, “man, there’s no magic words. Just go shoot. You’d be shocked at the amount of film, amount of things I do on a daily basis, and sometimes no one will ever see it. I make it so that no one will ever see it, to experiment. If you think you might want to go do something, don’t wait, start failing early.” I want to direct one day. I want to start failing early at it so hopefully by the time I’m older, I’ll have more experience. Whatever it is, just do it. If you want to sculpt, and you don’t know how to sculpt, go buy some clay. Go dig up some dirt in your backyard. Just don’t try to do anything perfect. Set yourself up to fail so you know what you’re not supposed to be.

The latest release from Sylvain Chomet, director of 2003’s acclaimed “The Triplets of Belleville,” is the product of substantial strife and controversy. Adapted from a 1956 screenplay by the French comic, actor, and director Jacques Tati, “The Illusionist” follows an impoverished French magician who brings his show to Scotland after facing competition from more modern entertainments. There he takes in Alice, a young girl who believes his illusions are real. The script is often read as an allegory about Tati’s strained relations with his daughters, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel and Sophie Tatischeff. He was unable to spend time with Tatischeff because of his work in film, and never acknowledged Schiel publicly. Chomet dedicates the film to Tatischeff, a choice that offended Schiel’s family and stoked scandal in France.
Together, the legacy of Tati and the controversy surrounding “The Illusionist” offer insight into why the film feels incomplete. Out of reverence for Tati’s story, Chomet has taken great care to remain faithful to his source material. The product is a film that feels safe and derivative. The animation of “The Illusionist” is clean and polished, and its narrative tightly structured, yet it lacks the imagination and boldness of his previous work.
The most obvious reason that the film disappoints is a simple one: Chomet forgoes the sprawling chaos that made “Belleville” so visually compelling. In that film, Chomet was willing to let the seams of the animation show; audiences rallied around the hand-drawn film as an alternative to the cold perfection of computer-generated imagery. Chomet allows brief glimpses of this aesthetic in “The Illusionist.” In one particularly striking scene in a train station, the color and detail of the building fades as the eye travels up into the eaves, until the station resembles an architectural sketch more than a real place.
Yet in most of “The Illusionist,” Chomet has scrubbed away the quirky surrealism that made “Belleville” memorable. The settings look like they were cribbed from a classic Disney film, and the Scottish countryside is rendered in solid colors and clean lines—a dramatic break from the dazzling, chaotic metropolis of “Belleville.” And whereas the citizens of Belleville were grotesque caricatures that limped, tripped, and bicycled through the frame, the characters of “The Illusionist” move as smoothly as real people. Besides a few alarmingly thin necks, they look like them, too.
This is an area in which Chomet’s loyalty to Tati’s memory—Tatischeff looks exactly like his real-life model—prevents him from exercising his full creative powers, and the film suffers for it. Similarly, the director shies away from giving Alice any flaws or interesting characteristics beyond her extraordinary naïveté, possibly out of respect for Sophie Tatischeff, on whom the character is based.
And when Chomet does revisit the techniques that succeeded in “Belleville,” they feel misplaced. In his previous film, he relied almost entirely on pantomime to convey the narrative. This worked well, because “Belleville” is structured around action, rather than character development, and dialogue is beside the point. “The Illusionist,” however, portrays the trajectory of the relationship between Tatischeff and Alice. Because the characters communicate in a pidgin of pantomime and un-subtitled Gaelic, instead of words the audience can understand, their story lacks necessary nuance. Despite its considerable cleverness and whimsy, then, “The Illusionist” is ultimately bland and forgettable.
“The Illusionist,” however, is not without charm. Although its animation lacks the over-the-top creativity of “Belleville,” it is skillfully drawn; indeed, animation by hand has become so rare that any new work in the genre is a treat. Chomet’s wacky, politically incorrect humor, too, feels fresh and original. The effeminate mannerisms of the rock band that upstages Tatischeff may make gay rights activists uncomfortable; their antics evoke unpleasant stereotypes. But it is nonetheless refreshing to see this type of humor used so openly in a cartoon. It adds a pungency to counteract the narrative’s sweetness, and unlike the tacked-on innuendo of the “Shrek” or “Toy Story” films, the humor of “The Illusionist” is not disingenuous; this is a film for intelligent adults, and Chomet is not afraid to make that clear.
The plot of “The Illusionist” obviously resonates with Chomet, whose old-fashioned storytelling methods and aesthetic sensibilities are rapidly becoming as antiquated as Tatischeff’s prestidigitation. Despite this resonance, though, Chomet fails to make “The Illusionist” his own. The film is neither a Chomet cartoon nor a Tati comedy; it hangs in limbo, lacking the bold vision of either auteur. Despite its status as a malformed artistic miscarriage, though, it retains some interest as an afternoon’s diversion and as a curiosity in film history. Given the arduous circumstances of the film’s creation, it is hard to see how Chomet might have made “The Illusionist” into anything more. But an informed understanding of the reasons for the film’s limitations is not enough to overcome the lingering sense of disappointment it leaves.

With David Fincher’s “The Social Network” sweeping the Golden Globes and Tom Hooper’s “The King’s Speech” pulling an upset at the Director’s Guild of America, early 2011 has rightly been dubbed by critic Pete Hammond “one of the most schizophrenic awards seasons in recent memory.” Given such a competitive field, any number of outcomes is possible at the Academy Awards on February 27. Even setting aside traditional heavy-hitters like “Best Picture” and “Best Directing,” many of the less-heralded awards are also hotly contested. One of the most exciting of these races is the fight for “Best Cinematography,” where rarely have all five nominees been of such similarly high caliber.
But what exactly is cinematography? Most moviegoers have only a vague notion of this key aspect of filmmaking, for which even Webster’s dictionary gives an unhelpfully nebulous definition: “the art or science of motion-picture photography.” To remedy this confusion, an Oscar primer is in order.
The cinematographer—also known as the Director of Photography, or “DP”—though one of the most obscure members of the production team, is responsible for all the visual elements of a film. He or she makes every creative choice related to composition, lighting, and camera motion—anything that audiences can see in a given shot. The DP determines everything from color to depth-of-field—how much of the shot is in focus versus how much is blurry—from zoom to the positioning of people and objects within any given frame.
Needless to say, this is no simple task. From choosing the lenses and film stock—will the film be grainy? lush?—to lighting the set and instructing the camera operator, the cinematographer is one of the movie director’s closest collaborators and as such DPs often accompany directors from project to project. Polish native Janusz Kaminski, for example, has worked on every Steven Spielberg film since “Schindler’s List.” With the right combination of creativity, technological savvy, attention to detail, and a touch of good fortune, DPs can produce visually stunning works—the finest of which receive Academy Award nominations for “Best Cinematography.” Who deserves to take home the statue this year? Let’s take a closer look at the competitors.
In “Black Swan,” DP Matthew Libatique paints the screen with rich lighting and a broad range of strong, emotionally charged colors. The rollercoaster psychodrama of the film is realized through a mixture of gritty steady-cam and handheld shots, while for the dance scenes, long takes with complicated choreography—for both actors and camera operators—give the movie a genuinely lyrical feel. But in matters of shot composition and its effect on audiences, one can question Libatique’s judgment. For one, there is the greatly overused shot of Natalie Portman walking with the camera behind her at shoulder-height, placing her distinctive ballerina hair bun in the center of the frame. The frequent recurrence of this shot, aside from its tediousness, overplays Portman’s identity as a ballerina, effectively shoving this element of her character down audience members’ throats.
Tedium poses no such difficulties for “Inception,” which inhabits a stylistic realm all its own. The exploratory, exhibitionist, and technological feel of the film’s dream world is contrasted with the warm, more earthy sensibility of reality in DP Wally Pfister’s impressive vision. Then again, are the film’s spectacular visuals really attributable to cinematography? Or are they the work of the movie’s special effects team? Perhaps Pfister is getting more credit than he deserves—although the aid of revolutionary visual effects didn’t prevent the Academy from rewarding DP Mauro Fiore for last year’s “Avatar.”
While “The Social Network” has been lauded more for its social commentary than its cinematography, one shouldn’t short change DP Jeff Cronenweth’s contribution. His choices of color palette lend an authentically New England look to a recreated Harvard, and his compositional choices make shots of the less-than-engaging activity of computer programming look like stylized art. However, there are moments when the film feels overly produced, for no discernible reason. Excessive use of green filters and extremely shallow depths-of-field do little to advance the story, and give the impression of stylization for the sake of being stylized.
“The King’s Speech” takes classical cinematography and turns it on its head, to great effect. DP Danny Cohen virtually abandons the traditional shot-reverse-shot style of conversation—heads are on the wrong sides of the screen, actors’ noses are pressed up against the frame line, backgrounds take up 80% of the screen—and this unsettling style perfectly captures the internal tension and discomfort of the film’s speech-challenged protagonist. Everyday occurrences and interactions are infused with awkwardness for audiences just as they are for the character.
While Cohen’s work is indeed impressive, it’s hard to argue with the mastery of eight-time-Oscar-nominee DP Roger Deakins in “True Grit.” His depictions of an undomesticated outback are nothing short of exquisite, while his subtle ability to set the mood with color is unparalleled. If there’s a favorite, Deakins is it—indeed, Tim Appelo of The Hollywood Reporter has argued that the film’s courtroom scene alone, where a craggy one-eyed Jeff Bridges is illuminated by a glorious spillage of sunlight, merits an Oscar.
In the end, it should come down to “The King’s Speech” and “True Grit.” What could tip the scales? Well, “True Grit” is Deakins’s ninth nomination—many of those coming from his prior collaborations with Joel and Ethan Coen—and the exceedingly talented artist has yet to take home the statue; a win for him would thus be both timely and well-deserved. On the other hand, Danny Cohen is a relative newcomer to cinema, with plenty of future opportunities to blossom and receive commendation. That said, in “The King’s Speech,” he demonstrates undeniable ingenuity and boldness in a limited environment—while Deakins had the gorgeous landscapes of the Midwest at his disposal, Cohen was largely restricted to indoor talking heads. How does one separate skill from setting?
Come February 27, it seems as though Oscar voters for “Best Cinematography” will have as many factors to consider as the DP does when shooting a film. And while the qualifications of the category and the merits of its nominees may be deconstructed, the ultimate winner remains as mysterious as ever. Hopefully, though, readers will now understand the accomplishment of the victor when he or she is crowned.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All roads lead to Beethoven,” said Owen C. Young, a cellist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) on February 3. Apparently, fashion is no exception. Last Thursday, 10 student designers showcased evening wear inspired by Ludwig van Beethoven at Boston’s Symphony Hall in “Project Beethoven,” the BSO’s third annual composer-inspired fashion contest.
Models and designers walked amongst patrons before the concert, and, after conductor Sakari Oramo led the orchestra through an impressive performance, Symphony Hall’s Cohen Wing was transformed into a runway. At the end of the night, two designers—a ‘patron favorite’ and a ‘judges favorite’—were recognized for their pieces. While some patrons came exclusively for the music, the designers’ artistry demonstrated that fashion gleans its visions from unsuspected sources and intrigues unsuspecting onlookers.
Project Beethoven called for artistic ambition: student designers from various schools near Boston  drew inspiration the iconic classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven to create their modern designs. While many designers remarked on the challenges that the theme presented, Elizabeth A. Bentley, a professor of Apparel Design at the Rhode Island School of Design, says that the theme was consistent with the ideas behind fashion design. “That’s what art is all about; you absorb the culture around you and turn it into something three dimensional. Apparel is basically architecture for the body, sculpture for the body. So this made sense,” says Bentley.
The event also presented many of these aspiring professional designers with their first opportunities to put their schooling into practice. “It was kind of personal because it was one of the first things that I have really drawn, sketched, and made, and it came out really well. I’m really proud of it,” says Ashley R. Boiardi, a student at Framingham State University.
The varying interpretations of Project Beethoven’s theme were similar to the myriad interpretations of Beethoven’s musical works. Designer Candice X. Wu from the School of Fashion Design in Boston took inspiration from instruments and the concert hall itself, creating a black floor-length dress with a piano key pattern around the midriff and gold-backed designs similar to those found in the hall. Others took inspiration from Beethoven’s music and the costume style during the period. Boiardi chose to focus on Beethoven himself. “I started looking at him as a person,” she said. “I focused in on 1792. He was my age, in his 20s. He was composing music, but nobody really knew who he was, like myself. I’m an aspiring designer making garments but they’re not mass-produced or anything.” The result was a striking red dress with a white tuxedo pleat around the neck that won Boiardi the distinction of ‘patron favorite.’
Designer Maria E. Canada from the Rhode Island School of Design was the winner of the ‘judges favorite.’ “Maria did an outstanding job of execution and interpretation and design elements,” said judge Sara J. Campbell. Despite her victory, however, Canada acknowledges that she still has a lot to learn from the fashion world. “Honestly, I would like to go work with somebody that’s really big or do a post-graduate, do my masters,” she said about her future plans. “I really want to learn the craft and the trade, because if I want to do this, I want to do it the best I can possibly do it. So I feel like I’ve got a lot of years of training ahead of me.”
Though the fashion aspect of Project Beethoven offered a fresh perspective on classical symphony performance, many of the BSO’s patrons came solely to hear Beethoven’s music. The night’s program featured world-renowned Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo, who led the orchestra through Mussorgsky’s “Night on Bald Mountain” and Prokofiev’s “Symphony No. 6 in E-Flat minor.” Most impressive was the orchestra’s rendition of Beethoven’s “Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor,” which showcased the exceptional talent of pianist Radu Lupu.
Orchestra and pianist alike showed a nuanced mastery of Beethoven’s work, but Lupu’s expressive performance was unparalleled. Rather than attempting to match the orchestra’s grandeur, Lupu focused on a tender and emotional though still powerful rendition of the concerto. When pianist and orchestra played together, they melded without becoming muddled, and when they played separately they provided interesting contrasts on the  piece’s overarching themes.
“Beethoven is certainly one of the colossal figures in western music, and can be interpreted many different ways,” said Young. Between the clothing designs inspired by Beethoven, and Oramo’s and Lupu’s rendition of the great composer’s piano concerto, “Project Beethoven” certainly proved just how diverse those interpretations can be.

Joseph O’Connor’s “Ghost Light” is a work fraught with strange and marvelous turns of phrase, with words that linger on the tongue days after reading. “The strange bloom of the red bracken in the early morning,” he writes, “is like the sheen … from a pregnant woman’s skin.”
The novel is presented in an eclectic mix of styles—namely in letters, in narrative, in fragments of recollections, and in poetry. As it progresses, “Ghost Light” becomes a slow unearthing of the layers of a dying woman’s memories. This woman is Molly Allgood, down on her luck, but retaining the fierce pride of her youth. Her story begins when she is older and desperately poor, but we learn from her letters and reminiscences that she was a beautiful actress and the fiancée of the Irish playwright, John Millington Synge, best known for “The Playboy of the Western World,” in which she played the lead. As she wanders through the streets of London over 40 years later, the memories she recounts form a fragmented and incomplete love story, centered not so much on their love, as on what doomed it.
O’Connor’s language is fantastically rich, to the point that it casts serious doubts on whether Allgood is the actual narrator of the novel. It seems implausible that a woman who has read nearly nothing before she meets Synge at age 20 could possibly produce such vivid images of Ireland and comprehensive descriptions of her fiancé’s writing process. The narrator describes Synge’s peculiar mental state with pith and desperation: “It is like watching the muzzle-flash of a gun through fog yet wanting the bullets to hit you.” Whether it is actually meant to be Allgood or the voice of O’Connor stepping in, the result is a varied and visceral portrait of the two lives and how they intertwine. O’Connor could not have made their lives tangible without this liberty. The contrast between the cerebral descriptions and the earthy dialogue adds momentum to the narrative. And though there are times when the Irish affectations in the characters’ speech feel stilted, archaisms such as the frequent use of “auld” add color and depth to the work.
Although Allgood refuses to admit that she is in decline, O’Connor intimates this fact through her foggy perception of the world around her—a subtle technique that spares both Allgood and the reader the potential emotional devastation of the character’s downfall. His portrayal of her unstable stream of consciousness feels strikingly natural. Yet, some moments when she talks to herself seem artificial. “There must always be a plan, girl,” she thinks, but a 60-year-old woman referring to herself as “girl” and speaking to herself as one would to a child does not ring true.
Nonetheless, O’Connor develops the tragedy in the relationship—Synge’s incurable cancer and Allgood’s desperation, the misunderstandings that slowly bloom between them—in strokes that are nothing short of masterful. Synge’s and Allgood’s relationship is complicated not only by their incompatible personalities, but also by a gulf in circumstance. Synge is a man of the aristocracy, writing plays about impoverished villagers in western Ireland. Allgood is from a large, poor family in Dublin, and is illiterate until the time of their meeting. Synge, though sincerely interested in Irish villagers, sees them as curiosities; he learns Gaelic, hoping to speak to them in their native tongue, and is shocked to find that they speak English. To Molly Allgood, they are people much like those with whom she grew up in the slums of Dublin. The resulting deterioration of their love is written with insight and sensitivity—culminating in a powerful contrast of two funerals that marks the different worlds in which Synge and Allgood moved and lived.
But despite O’Connor’s searing language, “Ghost Light” cannot completely satisfy; the beauty of O’Connor’s portrayal of Irish society establishes expectations that he does not fulfill in the understated love story. “Ghost Light” is a tragedy, but it lacks emotional impact, because the reader is unable to fathom how much is being lost. Synge and Allgood have a beautiful love affair, one full of missteps and unrealized longings. We can begin to understand the depth of their love through the way  that Allgood seems to remain changed by him in 1952—in her language, as well as in the way she observes and interacts with the world around her. However, in a book with such profoundly moving prose, a tale of hope and exchanged letters is not enough. With Joseph O’Connor’s language, the love story could have been written with intensity and clarity. Although it seems that Allgood and Synge are desperately in love, there is no passion to lend momentum to the meandering descriptions that are woven into the novel. The book concludes with a vague sadness, leaving only the feelings of pity for Allgood’s dreadful circumstances and wonder at the catastrophic toll that such an understated love has taken on her life. O’Connor’s lyricism establishes the expectation for a level of hope that the story never provides. While the result is beautiful, it disappoints by promising a romance and delivering an elegy.

In a February 3 reading at the Harvard Book Store, author Rana Dasgupta described the challenges of recreating history in his second novel, “Solo,” which follows the life of a Bulgarian centenarian. Dasgupta shared passages with a small but engaged audience about the early life of the main character, Ulrich, just before World War I. In the rest of the novel, he lives a long life of missed opportunities and lingering regrets that begin to manifest themselves as daydreams and fantasies.
The author overcame the challenges of writing about a character so different from himself through extensive research, saying  that before working on the novel, he had  considered Bulgaria a forgotten country, remote from the history of the 20th century. Dasgupta said that he hopes ”Solo” will show his readers how remarkable a seemingly mundane life can be.
“One of the very critical things that this book was trying to do,” said Dasgupta, “was to think about time … how one could create a sense of great duration in human life without there being lots and lots of great achievements.”
In discussing his influences, he credited Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky and his ability to narrate ‘empty’ time with intensity. Dasgupta also used films more directly in his research, explaining that Bulgarian films and documentaries helped him to recreate the history of the country.
Although he was unfamiliar with the historical setting before beginning the novel, his lack of “organic attachment” to Bulgaria did not deter Dasgupta from telling the story of the 20th century from the perspective of a bookkeeper from that region. However, he was modest about the thorough research he undertook to recreate the lives of 20th century Bulgarians.
“Even when you know the sequence of political events, you don’t really know how people lived,” said Dasgupta. “You have to know what objects people had in their houses, what things were available to eat.”
The core of his research consisted of interviews with native Bulgarians. They confirmed Dasgupta’s strong hunch that the region, despite being overlooked in most British history books, has a rich collection of personal narratives from two world wars, the rise and fall of communism, and renewed hope in the 21st century. Finishing his research in Bulgaria, Dasgupta then asked a local literary critic if Ulrich’s story could seem plausible to a native Bulgarian. He said that the critic responded, “you’ve just told me the story of the life of my father.”
Although he ultimately chose an unfamiliar setting and topic for “Solo,” Dasgupta feels that he could also have written a novel about his own life or the experiences of his family. He explained the decision to set “Solo” in Bulgaria by noting that he prefers not to talk about himself, and enjoys the process of learning through his writing. He continued that although he believes in the value of writing what one knows, he nevertheless feels that it is important to take risks in writing.
“Personally, in my own life, I think that writing should feel dangerous. It should feel like you could screw up, you could go wrong, you could fail,” he said.
Dasgupta said that one of his main goals in “Solo” was to “express the feeling of living [away] from the great centers of the world.” Although he says it is important for art to portray what lies outside the ‘great centers,’ the author is ultimately ambivalent about the experience of living on the periphery. Ulrich only sees opportunity for himself at the end of his life, a change in perspective that Dasgupta connects to Bulgaria’s new status on the global stage.
Ultimately, Dasgupta hopes that readers will feel “a level of empathy” while reading “Solo.” “There is a sense that places like [Bulgaria] can supply to you,” he said. “If you look at the places at the center of the world, you see the incredible achievements in a place like New York. If you were to look at that and take that to be the … totality, you would be missing the great sense of the system that we’re living in.”

The word ‘kaput’ conjures vague notions of brokenness or dysfunction, notions surprisingly apt for this latest, decidedly underwhelming output from Canadian Indie band Destroyer. “Kaputt” starts waning at its start. Its meager nine tracks blend into one apathetic, indistinguishable hour of limp vocals and languishing beats, in sharp contrast to the variety and dynamism of their previous album “Destroyer’s Rubies.”
“Kaputt” marks a shift from the band’s usual guitar-heavy classic-rock instrumentation. Lead singer and songwriter Dan Bejar seems interested in experimenting with jazz influences and consequentially employs saxophone and flute prominently on many of the songs. In theory, this choice should contribute some much needed variety to the otherwise limp album. In practice, however, the slow, muzak atmospherics and sluggish wind interludes clash with the electric beat that courses through most of the album. The resulting combination produces songs like “Suicide Demo for Kara Walker,” which sounds like the background music in the kind of swanky oriental bar Mad Men’s Don Draper would frequent. The jazz flute interludes are painfully slow and far too long to blend in seamlessly with the rest of the song.
“Suicide Demo” is typical of the album in that it builds at a glacial pace, taking almost three minutes before the listener hears any vocals. “Savage Night at the Opera” falls prey to the same problem, although—when Bejar finally deigns to sing—the lyrics are arresting, if inscrutable: “Old souls like us are being born to die / It’s not a war till someone loses an eye.” Whatever Bejar is trying to express here, he does so with typical poetic flair. True to form, Bejar steers clear of narrative in favor of impressionistic imagery. His lyrics are more evocative than representational, but demand some kind of gut response from the listener. It is through his lyrics, more than anything else, that Bejar manages to engage his audience.
The title track is more thoughtfully produced than most of the songs, but the jazz aesthetic is still jarringly juxtaposed with impassive vocals and a labouring disco beat. Bejar sings, “Wasting your days / Chasing some girls / All right / Chasing cocaine / Through the back rooms of the world / All night.” Once again, Bejar provides a vivid impression of a certain lifestyle, but the lack of feeling with which he delivers these ostensibly judgmental lyrics divests them of impact.
And therein lies the album’s principal flaw: its complete and utter lack of conviction. For someone whose voice and style have been likened to those of David Bowie, Bejar has a remarkable inability to get excited by anything he sings. Bejar’s most infuriating characteristic is his imperturbability. Nothing seems able to shake him out of his complacent monotone. He rarely sings on “Kaputt,” but instead speaks in a nasal, self-satisfied voice. What makes the tracks so homogenous is the identical pace that Bejar maintains through all of them: he speak-sings at exactly the same speed on every song. It is almost metronomic in its precision, but the effect is oppressive.
On previous albums, including “Destroyer’s Rubies,” Bejar’s signature voice managed to sound understated but impassioned. Songs like “Your Blood” proved that, when he does sing, the results are delightful. On this track and elsewhere—at least on “Destroyer’s Rubies”—Bejar recalls Bob Dylan. But on Destroyer’s latest, it’s as though Bejar has decided he can no longer be bothered.
Bejar’s apathy and indulgence peak on the album’s final track, “Bay of Pigs.” At just over 11 minutes, “Bay of Pigs” is the longest—and slowest—track on the album by a long shot. Instead of increasing the pace for a rousing finale to the album, Bejar slows it down and minimizes musical accompaniment to such an extent that the track practically stops. After another interminable introduction Bejar finally says “I don’t know what I’m doing / Alone in the dark.” After “Kaputt,” that much was already clear.

The title of the Go! Team’s highly anticipated third full-length perpetuates the electrical theme of their memorable 2004 debut, “Thunder, Lightning, Strike,” as well as encapsulating all the connotations of destruction, aggression, and volume that make the band so divisive. Helmed by mastermind Ian Parton, the Brighton-based band’s singular sound has always been charged with a certain schizophrenia. Their inclusive, eclectic approach can bury the nuance, and their songs sometimes toe the line between exuberant collage and grating, disorienting assault. But more often than not, their bombastic pastiches—which combine obscure, far-flung samples, schoolyard chants, a rotating troupe of vocalists, and every instrument known to man—create a shockingly cohesive, genre-bending experience of peerless energy and creativity.
To accuse the sextet of doing too much would be remiss, because few groups can match their ingenious blend of influences or their pop sensibilities. Though you wouldn’t know it from the blaring horns and incomprehensible rapping of opening track “T.O.R.N.A.D.O.,” this album might be their most tuneful yet. Its most compelling cuts often lean more toward vocal than toward instrumental greatness.
Even more so than their last album, “Rolling Blackouts” makes excellent use of its guest stars. Last time around, Public Enemy’s Chuck D became the first male vocalist ever featured on a Go! Team track (“Flashlight Fight”), and the result was surprisingly muddled and forgettable. Parton wisely returns to an all-girl cast on “Rolling Blackouts,” and each one charms—no small feat given his remarkably consistent regular vocalists, drummer Chi Fukami Taylor and multi-instrumentalist Kaori Tsuchida. 19-year-old Tampa rapper Dominique Young Unique takes the lead on the upbeat, dreamlike “Apollo Throwdown” with the same verve and wit as longtime Go! Team MC Ninja. The distinctive voice of Deerhoof’s Satomi Matsuzaki is equally welcome on the churning, perfectly paced “Secretary Song,” one of the most jubilant songs about workday malaise in recent memory.
The Go! Team is most exciting on the LP when they reveal their vintage girl-pop tendencies. These are most readily apparent on “Ready to Go Steady,” the lo-fi drumwork, handclaps, and vulnerable lyrics of which would not seem out of place on a Sarah Records tribute. “I’m not so good with words, so let me tell it straight,” French chanteuse Lispector offers, and the lilt in her chorus—“I know we just met but I am ready to go steady,” emphasis on the “ready”—proves irresistible. “Buy Nothing Day”—the album’s anthemic, scuzzed-out centerpiece—is just as thrilling, as it features Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino against a much more layered backdrop than she’s accustomed to. She shows up once more on the title track, whose distorted, whirring guitars create a uniform sensation of urgency.
Despite the strength of the female vocals throughout, “Rolling Blackouts” would not be a Go! Team record without a handful of instrumentals, and as usual, this batch is mixed. The big-band sound of “Bust-Out Brigade” could soundtrack a ‘70s spy movie, and the spacey “Super Triangle” wanders amiably, while the piano-driven “Lazy Poltergeist” is the album’s lifeless low point. But the cinematic strings, banjo, slide guitar, and melodica of “Yosemite Theme” showcase the Go! Team at their best. Taking off around the 40-second mark and never letting up, the track calls to mind one of their most poignant songs, “Everyone’s a V.I.P. to Someone.” While “Yosemite Theme” seems a perfect closing track, its underemphasized placement makes it no less gripping, and the elegant outro casts a wistful glow over the remainder of the album.
Many doubted whether the Go! Team could sustain their relentless experimentalism into a third release, but “Rolling Blackouts” shows the band is here to stay. It’s been a long four years to wait, but in its well-chosen guest spots and tightly crafted riffs, “Rolling Blackouts” proves satisfying and balanced. Sounds like they’re ready to go steady if we are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bedspread made by famed Bauhaus artist Anni Albers, who immigrated to the United States with her husband Josef Albers in 1933, is as much a part of Harvard’s history as its university art collection. Her textiles adorned the beds of students at the Graduate School of Design, where architect Walter Gropius—who had commissioned the piece—taught after his departure from Germany under Nazi pressure.
The bedspread can exemplify Bauhaus ideals or convey the translation of a European avant-garde across the Atlantic. It plays a part both in Harvard’s history and its role in the war on the artistic front—the university welcomed a renowned figure like Gropius while also purchasing modern German works shown in the infamous Degenerate Art Show. As a personal artifact of Albers, it speaks of exile under pressing circumstances. To limit the object to one story and one category of classification is to ignore how multifaceted it is.
The same could be said of the other 200 objects on display in the exhibition “Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History,” held in the special gallery of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments at the Science Center. The collection is part of U.S. in the World 30, a General Education course of the same title introduced this spring.
For the past nine years, Laurel T. Ulrich, the 300th Anniversary University Professor, and Ivan Gaskell, Margaret S. Winthrop Curator in the Harvard Art Museum and Senior Lecturer on History, taught a seminar that required original student research on objects from the Harvard collections. The seminar—a blueprint for “Tangible Things”—brought forth 83 original student projects, which supply many objects now visible in the exhibition.
“When you’re working with actual objects, it’s one thing to sit around a table where you can have the things there and students can pass the object around and really look at them and describe them,” said Gaskell, “but to do something on a large scale that could involve more students than can sit around a table—that was our ambition.”
Working with curators from different collections and the General Education office, Ulrich and Gaskell translated a successful small seminar into a lecture course of 250. The course uses objects from Harvard’s collections to trace how the university’s extensive collections have developed: they reveal that the categories that separate medical specimens, ethnographic artifacts, art pieces, or even the artificial and natural are neither obvious nor definite.
Looking closely at an object—how it was made, who produced it, who bought it, how it was used, and how it ended up at Harvard—allows its history to extend beyond the temporal context in which it was produced. “You begin thinking differently about history. History is something that is created,” said Ulrich. “It’s not just out there ready to be plucked, but something actually made through self-conscious decisions about what to keep and what not to keep.”
“Tangible Things” includes both a stand-alone exhibit in the Science Center and guest objects—things taken from their expected locations and shunted into new settings and collections throughout the campus. With some of its more unusual objects, these questions must have been harder to answer than expected: Where do you store a jar of tapeworms removed from a blue-blooded Bostonian? What do you do with bottles of chemicals from the Civil War era labeled in French and marked as belonging to the Medical College of Alabama? Where do John Singer Sargent’s palette, Mark Twain’s microscope, Louis Aggasiz’s Brazilian coffee beans, and Henry David Thoreau’s pencil belong? Students in the course are asked to visit the exhibit and complete assignments, and are encouraged to classify these objects that extend beyond rigid modern categorization.
“By questioning these old categories, we are also looking back to a time when these categories weren’t so fixed,” said Sara J. Schechner ‘79, David P. Wheatland Curator of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments and a co-curator of “Tangible Things.” “There were prior ways of organizing the world and our current divisions have evolved from those—but if you step back and look at things again, they blur.” She added, “these divisions aren’t natural in the sense that they come from how the universe was made. They are human constructions based on how we in our culture and those in other cultures view the world and decide to compartmentalize things.” In the case of this exhibition, this blurring is made literal. “Tangible Things”—in its range of objects from a century old tortilla to a “Girls Are Not Chicks” poster—harkens back more to a cabinet of curiosities than the modern didactic museum show. However, the unanticipated exhibit drives the viewer to question what the collection gains by sacrificing this pristine museum organization.
“When you walk into certain kinds of museums or collections, you get visual cues or clues as to how you should read or understand those things,” said Sarah A. Carter ’02, Lecturer on History and Literature. Carter is the principal coordinator of the show, and a former student of Gaskell and Ulrich’s undergraduate seminar years ago. “These clues suggest the kinds of questions that you would want to ask about that object ...When things are moved out of the places you expect them, suddenly you realize that maybe those questions aren’t adequate anymore,” she said. An aim of this exhibit is to trigger these novel, unexpected questions.
“Tangible Things”—the course and its exhibit—do not simply showcase the range of objects in Harvard’s collection. They are a testament to why we need things that run the gamut from the rare and obviously precious—paintings, silver goblets, a Galapagos tortoise shell—to the seemingly ordinary and often forgotten—a homemade dress for camp, a Hebrew pocketbook, and an advertisement for a silk trade company in China.
“If you are able to collect that range of things and think about [it] historically, materially, aesthetically, as specimens, as tools—[you] understand the past in a more nuanced way because people obviously lived surrounded by a broad range of things from fine arts to a toothbrush,” said Carter. Indeed, the display of objects in “Tangible Things” presents unique historical vignettes of the Harvard community.
“In the end this is about people, not things,” said Gaskell. “It’s about how people relate to each other through their making and uses of things and the role those things play in human relationships, whether those are relationships between individuals or social groups.” Gaskell’s sentiments strike to the core of the course and the exhibit. Now, as they did in their seminar, Gaskell and Ulrich urge new students and visitors to disregard their assumptions and just to look closely at these tangible things.

Port Bonita, Wash. is the indubitable protagonist and common thread running through the parallel plotlines of Jonathan Evison’s second novel, “West of Here,” which follows his well-received 2008 debut, “All About Lulu.” The novel features an overabundance of characters living in the fictional town of Port Bonita in 1890 and 2006. Despite the temporal gap between the two plotlines, Evison maintains the novel’s continuity through short chapters that jump across time without leaving the distinctive locale.
The novel opens and closes with descriptions of the same scene in 2006. In order to truly understand the ending, the reader must return to the beginning—much like how the descendants of Port Bonita’s founders must look to the past in order to better understand their problems. In 1890, Ethan Thornburgh seeks to revolutionize the American West and make Port Bonita a commercial hub on the Pacific, finding an opportunity to do so in the Great Seattle Fire of summer, 1889. More than a century later, his great-great-grandson Jared must announce the demolition of the town’s dam due to concerns about the welfare of the local salmon population.
Evison prevents the narrative from becoming overburdened with characters by crafting circumstantial parallels between the two plots, unifying a story that would otherwise feel disjointed. A modern ex-convict named Timmon escapes parole by using the travel log of an expedition that passed through Port Bonita in 1890. Two fiercely independent women living 116 years apart find themselves in similar predicaments after becoming pregnant. Two young Native American boys must deal with broken homes and personal demons.
Evison manipulates the narrative so that these parallel vignettes are presented close together, eliciting thought about the similarities and differences between the characters’ experiences. As Timmon realizes, “his fate was inextricably linked in the most arbitrary ways to things and people and events he’d never given a thought to.” The population of Port Bonita interacts in unpredictable ways, and this intricate web of connections makes each character engaging without creating emotional investment in any single individual. Ultimately this detachment proves that “West of Here” is a book more about a place and its collective population than it is bout any single protagonist.
The characters fight personal battles—some that pit them against one another, and others that see them working for the same cause—but it is Port Bonita itself which remains the centerpiece of Evison’s meandering plot. There is no end or beginning to “West of Here,” only happenings which transpire over two periods of several months, over a century apart. Due to Evison’s choice to forgo a single plot and to instead recount the lives of many individuals, his narrative maintains a realistic style that feels honest and genuine.
However, Evison endangers his credibility by introducing a supernatural element in the latter portion of the novel. It is not essential to the storytelling, and detracts from the plausibility necessary in a work so rooted in history. A large portion of the book concerns itself with the lives of Native Americans living in the territory, in the past and the present, and two individuals experience a “walk in the spirit world” which adds a distinct element of fantasy to Evison’s otherwise realistic plot. The abrupt appearance of this metaphysical episode deviates from the previously established form, a move so surprising that it undercuts the rapport and trust between author and reader that Evison tries to foster.
Evison’s language is clear and easy to read, and he provides stunningly beautiful descriptions of the Pacific Northwest, particularly through the eyes of James Mather, the leader of an 1890 expedition to Mount Olympus. His companion Haywood, who is also the expedition chronicler, writes about “a high-canopied forest fecund with rot, a brackish cathedral festooned with moss. [Haywood] would describe the biggest timber he’s ever laid eyes on, spruce wider than train cars, colonnades of hemlock so massive that ‘the wingspan of three men stretched finger to finger could not match the diameter of these giants.’ He would describe a soft and yielding forest floor, presenting a crust so brittle with rot that the casual footfall would break through the surface.” The comprehensive detail of Evison’s descriptions of nature reveals his deep knowledge of the beauty and potential danger of the region.
The gorgeous but often harsh landscape aside, people play an important role in this novel, and Evison sympathetically and comprehensively protrays their interactions with their history, their city, and each other. The dying words of Chief Lord Jim express this sentiment best: “We are born haunted … Haunted by our fathers and mothers and daughters, and by people we don’t remember. We are haunted by otherness, by the path not taken, by the life unlived. We are haunted by the changing winds and the ebbing tides of history. And even as our own flame burns brightest, we are haunted by the embers of the first dying fire. But mostly, we are haunted by ourselves.” The characters whose paths cross in Port Bonita are haunted by one another and by the spirit of the town itself. Evison develops their interconnectedness so that even the most tangential and banal encounters have unforeseen consequences as history pushes the town forward, ultimately allowing one individual to escape and find his own frontier. Port Bonita remains a frontier settlement at its core—when there is nothing new there to explore, the characters move on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in its heyday, "Metal Gear Solid" was the series for gritty, pulse-pounding, stealth action. If you wanted a change of pace from the frenzied, shoot-everything-that-moves first-person shooter genre, then you could always turn to a "Metal Gear Solid" game for a slower, craftier, but ultimately thrilling experience: crawling through air ducts to snipe unsuspecting guards, stuffing bodies in lockers, shooting cameras to slip through corridors undetected, and so on. It all made James Bond seem practically boorish.
I replayed "Metal Gear Solid 2" during J-Term in hopes of reliving my first secret agent experience. After all, when I played the game as a kid, I remember doing all of the following:
1. sneaking down corridors with super-stealth skills
2. creeping up and snapping necks of unsuspecting guards like toothpicks
3. keeping a very stoic, hardcore expression on my face at all times, just so any passerby watching me play would know that I was saving the world and it was SERIOUS BUSINESS
Well, since I’ve picked up the games again, the experience seems to have changed. This time around, I instead did this:
1. tiptoed down corridors like a preteen trying to sneak out of the house, checking over my shoulder every five seconds just in case Mommy had woken up
2. attempted to snap the necks of unsuspecting guards, but usually got spotted by said guards, sending me crying down a corridor amidst a stream of enemy gunfire while I scrambled to find a place to hide from the scary bullies
3. yelped at an agonizingly high pitch whenever something startled me (roughly every three minutes), causing my mom to ask “Are you okay, honey?” in her ‘Concerned Mother Tone’
I … really wish I knew what happened. Was I that much better at gaming when I was eleven? Has my time at Harvard spent slaving over papers and problem sets weakened my gaming skills? Or did I just ask my older brother to beat all the hard parts of the game for me while I sat beside him and pretended it was really me being awesome?
In any case, despite my tendency to play in an overly cautious (read: “girly”) fashion, I loved playing through "Metal Gear Solid 2" again.
You play most of the game as Raiden, a young man who you’re supposed to believe is an expertly-trained, battle-ready soldier, despite the fact that his long, flowing locks of blonde hair would make Reese Witherspoon jealous. Also, he radios his girlfriend on a regular basis during the mission with complaints like—I am not making this up—“I’m scared of the night.” And this Raiden guy is in charge of rescuing the president.
The plot that follows starts out straightforward enough, but about halfway through it becomes something only a nerd could love. It has so many absurd plot twists and sci-fi hijinks thrown in that it all starts to make about as much sense as nailing Jell-O to a tree. This alone wouldn’t be so bothersome if it weren’t for all the time spent on the extraordinarily lengthy cutscenes. When I was little, I thought all the brooding gravity in the dialogue meant the game was deep. This time around I was able to laugh at some of the game’s overseriousness and appreciate it the same way I’d enjoy a cheesy B-movie—but all this does interrupt the flow of the gameplay.
Fortunately, even ten years after its original release, "Metal Gear"’s streamlined gameplay more than makes up for its melodrama. Lengthy sneaking segments are interspersed with over a half-dozen boss battles. The sneaking segments are cleverly designed, forcing you to combine careful planning with trigger-finger reflexes. It’s certainly possible to go through the game with guns-a-blazing recklessness, but the game will make that route very challenging—you’d be amazed how many reinforcements the bad guys have lying around—and the real thrill comes from outfoxing the enemies and taking them by surprise. The boss battles deserve special mention: no two bosses are alike, forcing you to utilize a whole range of gadgets and skills to ensure your victory. You’ll find yourself shooting missiles at jetplanes, defusing C4 bombs, swinging swords around (holy anachronism!), and, of course, exchanging lots of gunfire.
Even after spending a whole week getting C4’d, AK-47’d, and otherwise gunned down while trudging through the game’s increasingly absurd plot, when I finally vanquished the last boss I couldn’t help but tell my epic war stories to anyone who’d listen. Unfortunately, there are no purple hearts or medals of honor for thwarting video game enemies. But I think my listeners would’ve given me such awards if they’d had the chance—if only to shut me up for a few minutes.

A huddled audience in a jam-packed Sanders Theatre first met Ira Glass in complete darkness. Sitting alone on stage with all the lights off for the first five minutes of his lecture, the beloved National Public Radio (NPR) talk show host and creator of “This American Life” discussed the power of merely listening to a voice. Having started the night with creativity, originality, and poignancy, Glass joked, “you know, you look different than I expected too,” when the room finally brightened for the rest of his 90- minute program.
As part of the Celebrity Series of Boston, Glass’s Saturday evening lecture entitled “Radio Stories and Other Stories” explored the method and ideology behind his storytelling and concluded with a 10-minute question-and-answer session. With two CD players beside him—one for prerecorded quotes and another for background music—the night’s event unfolded almost like an episode of “This American Life,” as Glass interrupted his talk with personal anecdotes and played examples from the show.
The thin, scruffy radio personality said that when he first created his show in 1995, he wanted to inject journalism with all the things that makes life worth living—pleasure, humor, discovery, and joy. With the philosophy that reporters should depict the world as it is, Glass revealed that he often gathers stories from fan mail and listeners and connects them with weekly themes such as “Post-9/11 Experiences” or “What My Parents Pitched.”
Glass emphasized the importance of structure to his work. “All you need is the forward motion of action and the audience will wonder where we’re going,” he said. According to Glass, building suspense simply involves providing a sense of destination, with the narrator saying “this happened, and then this happened,” and so forth. Glass said this technique extends beyond radio, and was used by his childhood Rabbi and even by Jesus in sermons and parables.
Laughter permeated the venue throughout the night as Glass provided illustrations of this method of narrative construction. One audience favorite was an anecdote in which a war veteran named Peter dumped his dead wife’s ashes in the parking lot of the Lincoln National Center after discovering that the supposedly free, government-sponsored cremation actually involved a $16 service fee. On the surface, the story is ridiculous and shockingly amusing, but Glass discussed how the beauty lies in its deeper meaning. As an allegory for how the World War II generation once put their faith in the government, Glass called the story “profoundly relatable.”
Although the stories on his show are almost always left-field and unexpected, Glass took the time to address how creativity and inspiration are really just products of hard work. He said that early on in his career, he was relieved to learn that there is no magic or fairy dust involved in compelling storytelling. Oftentimes, his NPR staff will research 25 stories just to find three or four captivating ones to use. “You can lightning strike every week if you just wander around long enough in the rain,” Glass said.
Aside from all the jokes and stories, which involved everything from midgets to musicians, Glass also revealed a more serious side to his character. Offering his opinion on the current status of journalism, he said that in order to revive news broadcasting, factual reporters have to steal the aesthetics of opinion-makers like Jon Stewart and FOX News. Furthermore, he said radio can educate listeners about pressing issues like healthcare and the death of the car business while still establishing an emotional connection to the rest of the world. Glass noted that when he interviewed Sunni and Shiite Muslims, or ex-prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, he asked basic, heartfelt questions concerning their everyday thoughts, habits, and lifestyles.
For the most part, the audience was receptive to Glass’s lecture. Long-time NPR listener Amy E. Kenney liked hearing Glass deconstruct the thoughts behind his show. “I always thought he could make anything interesting, and I liked knowing that there’s a method behind the madness,” she said. Audience member Jason Schneider was also pleased with the lecture. “Radio is often so personal,” he said. “You don’t usually get to hear the laughter of the entire crowd, so it was nice to be in a place where you can feel the camaraderie.”
Glass gave the audience one final united laugh as he answered the question “Where do you see yourself in five years?” by joking, “I’ll be teaching Macroeconomics on this stage … but really, no, I don’t have any other skills, so I’m kind of stuck with what I’m doing now.”

“Zonoscope,” the third release by Australian indie-disco pioneers Cut Copy, has one of those delightful album covers that perfectly conveys the album’s aesthetic—in this case, an enormous waterfall washing impossibly over New York City. The album is an indie-rock-tinged synth-pop album on an epic scale—a rare product in a genre whose appeal is largely based in pure danceability—and inevitably, its hugeness does seem campy at times. However, Cut Copy ultimately—and miraculously—keep their ambitious production aloft through unwaveringly strong musicianship and unabashedly expansive takes on traditional pop themes.
Core elements of Cut Copy’s style flow faithfully through the album, rooting it in the synth-pop genre. A thumping dance-floor beat stands at each song’s center, around which the band shapes its lush synthesizer rhythms. Dan Whitford’s clean, emotional vocal hooks float imperturbably above the rich instrumentals. A bright ‘80s sheen emanates from the smooth electronic pulse of most tracks. Songs like “Take Me Over” and “Pharaohs & Pyramids” make it clear that, despite the album’s adventurously dense production, the band has disco in their veins.
Cut Copy do not forget their winning pop sensibility either—while the album lacks a catchy breakout hit, the band generates every verse, chorus, and synth riff with a natural sense of brilliantly simple hooks and vocal melodies. Almost every song adheres to a standard verse-chorus structure, building tension with catchy verses then launching into anthemic choruses.
The musical and structural influences of synth-pop are consistent through the album. But “Zonoscope” is ultimately defined by its extraordinary diversity. Over the framework of their genre mastery, Cut Copy grab freely from a vast spread of musical traditions—the echoing, passionately swelling vocals and low bass pulse on “Need You Now” channel U2 via Yeasayer; “Blink and You’ll Miss A Revolution” crosses synth-punk bass with blissful, tribal percussion lines and an ethereal chorus. Each song transcends its synth-pop genealogy in a different way, and the resulting collection is of a grand scale—the songs all have their own energy and aesthetic, yet they feel like parts of a coherent whole.
Cut Copy manipulate these many elements with extraordinary deftness, capably pulling together their arsenal of musical and production components into charged mélanges. Their technique is one of continual rejuvenation, and  of endlessly fusing new components onto the synth-pop cores of their tracks. They do so elegantly and precisely—never do the tracks seem chaotic or bombastic; rather, they simply remain engagingly full-bodied, and never lose their focus or their appeal.
More impressively though, Cut Copy have constructed compositions that are naturally dynamic enough to support longer, more ambitious tracks. Further evoking “Joshua Tree”-era U2, “Need You Now” moves from its simple, rolling groove into a powerful symphony of interlocking synthesizer swirls as Whitford’s lovesick vocals build in desperation. This dynamism is not just limited to crescendos—“Pharaohs & Pyramids,” indie-psychedelic thumper “This Is All We’ve Got,” and sun-drenched anthem “Where I’m Going” reign their thunderous grooves back into long, captivating builds before returning for gargantuan finishes.
In isolation, Cut Copy’s lyrical focus on vapid pop themes would be unremarkable, but just as the music elevates synth-pop basics into lavish pieces, the lyrics coat their airheaded themes in a varnish of campy grandeur. “Blink And You’ll Miss A Revolution” and “Alisa” among others, cast hackneyed formulae of love troubles and escaping society onto great cosmic canvases, indulging in lyrics such as “Baby, baby, can’t you see / We’re on a path to eternity” and “10,000 years I’ve traveled / And many hearts unraveled.” These lyrics are shamelessly vacuous, but their dressing of simple themes in absurdly grandiose language ends up perfectly reinforcing the album’s titanic aesthetic.
Ultimately, the entire album’s structure is modeled in miniature by its 15-minute culminating song, “Sun God.” As the track shifts from elegantly brooding to indignantly anthemic and then ominously freeform, it keeps its ambitious scale focused through fluid, varied composition.
“Zonoscope” ends up a less accessible album than most in its genre— it requires a time commitment, and its schizophrenic variety can make for a demanding listen. However, for all of its stretched limits and diverse grandeur, “Zonoscope” stands confidently at an artistic height few synth-pop bands have reached.

Samuel Beam—better known as Iron & Wine—is often hailed as the master of simplicity. Plucking at his guitar and gently crafting poetically simple lyrics and lullaby-like melodies, Beam has the power to send listeners down memory lane and make cozy rooms turn in slow motion. Nine years after the band’s debut, Iron & Wine have released their most ambitious album yet: “Kiss Each Other Clean.” The album is an enormous departure from their earlier work. Its fusion of new sounds and genres perhaps shows artistic growth, but what the album gains from instrumental and vocal adventure, it loses in intimacy.
The move from bedroom studios to the hallowed halls of Warner Brothers has indeed transformed Iron & Wine’s overall sound, with Beam’s voice sounding louder and more defined than ever. Beam’s larger vocals complement the electric guitar solos and complex brass instrumentals on tracks like “Your Fake Name is Good Enough for Me,” the seven-minute album closer that starts off as a slow gospel jam before slowly crescendoing. With soaring harmonies enveloping his voice, Beam celebrates the different facets of human nature and identity through his lyrics. He declares beautifully, “We will become / ... Become the rising sun / ... Become the river sway / ... Become the blossom and the wilt / ... Become the weary and wild.”
Though the new elements blend together well, listening to the new album will inevitably leave the band’s devotees hungry for the holy hushes that once made Iron & Wine tracks intoxicatingly tender. Instead of creating small, poetic images like the early-morning, autumn romance of “Naked as We Came,” “Kiss Each Other Clean” focuses more on producing catchy songs. “Monkeys Uptown,” for example, is compositionally playful, employing light staccato notes and tribal drums to interrupt its melodic phrases. However, while Beam sings of heaven and the Archangel Gabriel, he fails to create any sort of mystical atmosphere. The result is a track that encourages contented foot-tapping, but one that fails to profit from Beam’s lyrical prowess.
“Big Burned Hand” is another instance of privileging the ears rather than the heart. Its outsized introduction—adorned with big band horns—gives the track a sprinkle of New Orleans jazz and allows the band to experiment with cross-genre textures. But with so many instruments fighting for attention, Beam’s voice becomes overshadowed. Many tracks suffer from this crammed production, and thus are bereft of Beam’s typically understated magic.
The album’s few ballads that may have let Beam’s signature skills shine instead rely on mundane melodies and stale structures. Even “Godless Brother in Love” which features Beam fading in and out of his falestto, simply wallows in a mid-register, mid-volume range, and lacks the intimacy, soft buildups, and poignancy that once made his ballads something to be cherished.
Still, the band’s fearless navigation through the unexpected is admirable. With retro jazz, tropical pulsations, and bluegrass sounds permeating the album, “Kiss Each Other Clean” is a transcontinental ride of sorts. While the country twang of “Half Moon” is juxtaposed with its soft female sighs, “Me and Lazarus” mixes lushness and core-funk feel to stunning effect. Beam shines lyrically on this track as well—his biblical reference to the revived leper is unexpectedly entertaining: “He’s an emancipated punk and he can dance / But he’s got a hole in the pocket of his pants / Must be a symptom of outstanding circumstances.”
While “Kiss Each Other Clean” succeeds in marking Beam’s development—and is a catchy, pleasing, and solidly produced album—it loses that special spark that makes Iron & Wine unique. In the midst of all the volume and orchestration, Beam seems to have forgotten that sometimes less is more, and that change is not always good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is easy to get lost in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA). As I wandered through the Americas exhibit on a lazy Saturday morning, my two friends and I made figure eights around each other, one following intricate silver dishes around the room, one scrutinizing each plaque, and I examining the dark wooden drawers and cubbyholes.
When our paths slowed and we converged on the third floor, I consulted my friend’s map and realized that the main entrance to the exhibit did not lead to the art I was primarily interested in: the Pre-Columbian section. The exhibit’s layout privileged post-colonial America. We had to actively seek out the older America, going down into the subterranean part of the museum to find it. 
Three large, orange-clay urns greeted us with wide animal eyes. I let myself be pulled from one warm, earth-colored vessel to the next. This part of the exhibit had a different feel from the rest; whereas the Europeanized furniture and paintings encouraged passive perusal, the first rooms of this lower level stopped me in my tracks—I tried not to flinch under the steady gaze of the jaguar or the serpent. There were more children in this room, children with dark hair who complained to their parents in Spanish that their feet were tired. This was a different America—the original America, the forgotten America, now strange.
My two Mexican-American friends and I had been in the museum for quite a while. When one friend suggested we go to a taquería in East Boston for lunch, several heads turned in recognition of the word—and perhaps in hunger, too. 
Pre-Columbian art, and especially Nahua art  (commonly known as Aztec art), has always captivated me. I’m certainly not the only one. Here in the United States, we have a preoccupation with reconstructing the past. We are proud of our exogenous roots, as if our families had come over in boats just a generation ago. For those of us with a Latin American background, however, our roots are a mix of the exogenous and the indigenous, and the mystery surrounding the indigenous roots only makes us cling more urgently to them.
The MFA offers us a glimpse of those roots—jade necklaces strung behind protective glass—but it is a sad glimpse, like the glimpse of a married woman’s neck, visible but somehow inaccessible. The black and red lines on the pottery, lines that threaten to fade away at any moment, are palimpsests with the ghosts of layers beneath them—layers of codices lost to the fire of the conquistadores, painstakingly painted on folded amatl paper by trained tlacuilos, masters of the red and black ink. The loss of the codices was also the loss of the origins they recorded. When Hernán Cortés’s men knocked down the causeways that fed water to the great city of Tenochtitlan, they cut the veins that brought life to the people. We are left with only remnants. We can try to contextualize them, but sometimes a plaque can tell us no more than “Figure.”
In Taquería Jalisco I ordered pozole: pork and hominy soup to which I added many spoonfuls of salsa roja. The broth took on an orange hue not unlike the pottery I had seen in the museum. As I felt the taste of Mexico slide warmly down my throat, I wondered just how far I was from the Mexico that had made the museum’s pottery. Certainly the corn was close to the origins, but what about the burrito my friend was eating? The Jarritos we were drinking? The music in Spanish in the background? Our conversation in English? So much was burned, but so much remains to tantalize.
In the end, the art in the lower portion of the MFA, the part submerged in the earth, means what we make it mean. It is the mythical, and not the historical, that forms who we are. I  choose to live the myth that I descended from a tlacuilo whose tears mixed with blood as she watched her beautiful amatl pages succumb to red flames and turn to black ash.
 
El vuelo verde del quetzal
escribe en el cielo
chalchihuites que reflejan 
el lago de nopales
el lago de lágrimas
el caldo espeso con sangre
con maíz de la tierra
maíz de la vida
maíz de la gente que vive
y busca su alma entre las cenizas de un sueño.
 
Translation:
The green flight of the quetzal
writes in the sky
jade gems that reflect
the lake of cactuses 
lake of tears
broth thick with blood
with maize of the earth
maize of life
maize of the living
who search for their souls in the ashes of a dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Often I settle in for an afternoon of reading and studying on the couch in our common room only to find myself, ten minutes later, drowsily attempting to focus on a sentence while the warm, slanted sunshine washes over my face. Lunch sits heavy in my stomach. The second hand on my watch ticks hypnotically. I finally give in and nod off—no one told me they have naptime in college. The last sentence, cackling maniacally, escapes.
Reading is a basically soporific exercise. It is best and easiest done alone, in quiet places with gentle lighting. You may play music, but only music carefully chosen so as not to be intrusive—instrumental, if you have it—and without surprising, distracting, or otherwise interesting features. There may be warm and calming drinks involved, along with comfortable pillows, and maybe even a blanket. In short, with the possible omission of brushing your teeth, the ideal reading environment resembles nothing so much as going to bed.
Thanks to the ritual of the bedtime story, most of us have associated reading with sleeping from infancy. You may even have once insisted, like the orphan girls in “Despicable Me,” that it was impossible to go to sleep without one. There’s nothing more distracting—and therefore relaxing—than immersing yourself in a fictional universe. It accomplishes the sometimes challenging trick of getting you to stop thinking about your own life long enough for sleep to slip in. Primetime and late night television programming provide, essentially, bedtime stories for grown-ups.
But at the same time, reading is also work. It may not be particularly strenuous, but it’s just demanding enough to push you from wornness into fatigue. This makes it difficult to do reading for class close to bedtime. Like trying to carry a heavy piece of furniture, the feeling of exhaustion increases the longer you’re at it. The quality of your reading goes down; you end up reading the same paragraph three times; and, when you wake up the next morning, glasses still on and textbook mashed under your side, you won’t remember a word of it. When reading is work, drowsy reading is about as unproductive as drinking at the office.
Bedtime reading as a separate category, though, is an entirely different world. Books that move episodically or in chunks, like “the collected letters of so-and-so,” work well; I’ve been working through Virginia Woolf’s on-and-off for a while. The back cover of “The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction” announces itself, in the words of the Times Literary Supplement, to be “an invaluable tool for understanding the Victorian literary milieu, and a first-rate bedside book as well.” One of my friends makes a goal of reading at least a couple pages a night—the incentive to finish being that she buys a new book as a treat for herself when she’s done.
We are at our potentially most vulnerable, in terms of taste, when it comes to bedtime reading—at our least inclined to suffer the dignified, the pretentious, and the boring. This is the moment when any reader is their innermost self—geekiest, most enthusiastic, most off-guard, most earnest. After all, it is probably the most childlike hour of the day, and, for lifelong readers, the Freudian moment when the deepest level of the individual as reader was forged. E.M. Forster speaks, in “Aspects of the Novel,” of having an irrationally strong attachment to “The Swiss Family Robinson” from childhood onward. He was a little embarrassed of this, but the key is to admit your first favorites with pride. One of my most distinct bedtime memories is of having Laura Ingalls Wilder’s entire “Little House” series read to me and my sister, a chapter at a time, over many nights. It’s no wonder I’ve ended up studying the nineteenth century; it set me to sleep and filled my dreams since before I could even read.
There is a very strong association between reading and the dream-state—surrendering yourself to a flow of words and images that are not wholly your own, but are nevertheless generated in your mind. Part of the spell of the first words of “Swann’s Way”—“For a long time, I put myself to bed early”—is that they launch us into the novel as though it’s simply one enormous dream­­—which, in a sense, it is. And, at its most sincere, this is how reading feels. Much of what we read for class cannot be dreaming; we have to pay attention to it, to work at it—it’s too hard for that. But that’s why bedtime reading, even at school, is so important to the life of the reader. It keeps reading what it should be: a species of dream.

“What is the bridge between visual and aural art?” This is the question Marina Rosenfeld ’90, addresses in all of her pieces, from her earliest “Sheer Frost Orchestra” to more recent installations such as “P.A. System.” The former Harvard music concentrator spoke about her art in the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts on February 7. She believes that visual and aural are “separate, superimposed modalities” of art; individual pieces of a greater artistic expression. Originally, Rosenfeld “was involved only in the aural side of that discussion,” she said. After graduating from Harvard she moved on to the California Institute of the Arts to “reverse the effects of Harvard’s regimental and fixed study of music.” As she continued in life, Rosenfeld’s “field of arts expanded” into dance, photography, and other visual arts. She has returned to Harvard not as a musician, but as a Visiting Lecturer in Visual and Environmental Studies.
Rosenfeld incorporates both sound and visuals into her installations, alongside dance, photography, costumes and interesting visual spaces. Each uses the breadth of human sense, not just one particular point on the artistic spectrum. Her propensity towards incorporating people into her works only adds to the feeling of completeness in her installations.  She also includes people in order to expose them to art since “people would have to come to it if they were in it.”
Rosenfeld has a particular interest in bringing women into the art world. In her first major installation, “Sheer Frost Orchestra,” she found 17 women who had never before touched a guitar, lined them up, and had them play electric guitars lying on the ground using bottles of nail polish according to Rosenfeld’s visual cues.  Another piece, “White Lines,” has a similar premise with an added visual layer. “[Musicians] interpret ... photos and video as graphic instruction and produce a performance,” Rosenfeld said.
Rosenfeld’s beginnings as a musician became apparent as she spoke about the relationship between music and sound. “The two are connected,” she said, “but not the same.” Sound is what filters through our eardrums. “Music,” she continued, “has a political meaning, a form, a history. Music implies a social connotation.” A band or an orchestra collect together to perform a piece that was written down, specifically and carefully. In her installations, Rosenfeld “gave the performers a visual system to cue the musicians” instead of traditional sheet music. She added, “I use only amateurs—though I hate that word.” Often the people in her pieces are arranged in lines. “[The line is] a form that deconstructs the classic setup of an orchestra or band,” Rosenfeld said. When an orchestra or band sit in the traditional rounded format, “those in front, like the violins and voice, seem more ‘important’ to the music, and the drums and brass in back simply provide a base.” In addition to the acoustic effects of re-arranging the performers, Rosenfeld’s work with rotating speakers blurs the sound. “[This] creates the opposite effect architects and musicians try to achieve in acoustically perfect concert halls,” she said.
More recently, she has begun to explore the idea of individual spaces in her work. In “P.A.,” she places speakers in abandoned construction sites, churches, parking lots, and various other locations and plays intermittent electronic sounds through them. The effect this creates “brings the aural component into the foreground of a situation” where most people would first look at the “pretty scenery,” Rosenfeld said. By breaking apart our standard conceptions of music (and visual art, and dance, and photography), Rosenfeld attempts to join many of the different contemporary media into a new exploration of art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 "I just didn’t think there would be any kind of serious dance at Harvard," says Larissa D. Koch ’08-’09. For much Harvard’s history, these pre-frosh expectations would have been justified. The dance program was only just created in 1964, and its scope was limited until 2000, when Elizabeth Bergmann was hired as the new Dance Director. "It soon became pretty clear that there was a lot for dancers here—and the source of so much of it turned out to be Liz," Koch says. Indeed, Koch found a wealth of dance opportunities as an undergraduate. After having resigned herself to a college career and future life without substantial outlets for dance, Koch now finds herself working as a freelance choreographer, in addition to being the head of her own contemporary dance company. To her own surprise, Koch has decided to send out applications not just to graduate medical schools, but to Master of Fine Arts dance programs as well.
Bergmann, who retired on February 1, had a tremendous influence on the state of dance at Harvard. She oversaw the introduction of dance courses into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences curriculum, the creation of Harvard’s Dance Center, and an increased respect for the study and practice of dance among Harvard faculty. Her greatest accomplishments, however, have been the revitalization of a deep love for dance in students who had given up on the form, and the demonstration to serious aspiring dancers that they may to go to college without hindering their professional goals. Bergmann leaves behind a robust dance community whose development should be credited to her.
DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION
Bergmann’s most visible accomplishments are the introduction of dance into Harvard’s academic curriculum and the administrative overhaul of the program. In addition to establishing a range of extracurricular performance classes and bringing in dancers from companies like Alvin Ailey and Paul Taylor to teach semester-long courses in the curriculum, Bergmann helped create a class focused on the historical and theoretical study of George Balanchine. She also taught Dramatic Arts 120: "Introduction to Choreography," and increased the quality of the dance program offered by the Office for the Arts (OFA). These educational options played a major role in invigorating the Harvard dance community.
The Dance Center, established in 2007, played an equally important role in facilitating dance at the College, and even helped to convince professional-track artists to attend Harvard. "The dance center was a huge draw," says Elizabeth C. Walker ’11, who took a year off for professional dance before coming to Harvard. Previously, dancers rehearsed at Radcliffe in a gym, a space Bergmann deemed inadequate for the caliber of program she was looking to build. "When I arrived at Harvard, rehearsals and performances were relegated to a very difficult spot. There was no New College Theatre, and the students themselves had to bring in lights and risers for every performance, so improving the space was one of the first orders of business," Bergmann says. Now students have their own space to choreograph, perform ,and rehearse, and the dance program has an important symbol of its growing legitimacy at Harvard.
Bergmann’s tenacity and esteem for her work made a substantial impact on the faculty perception of dance, as evidenced by the full faculty position in the Department of Music being established for the next Dance Director. The opening left by Bergmann, who held a staff position, has not yet been filled. Bergmann, however, had an influence that extended beyond her official title. "When Liz sat on the Committee of Dramatics, she was one of the most active members, invariably the one who would come with new course proposals and ideas. That committee was peopled by professors across the humanities," says Director of the OFA Jack Megan. "She has made dance a legitimate area of study here, not only alongside the curriculum, but [also] within it."
However, Bergmann is the first to admit that there is still much left to be done in improving the dance program. "I would like Harvard to have a dance concentration, for one," she says. "Until dance becomes a real program with more faculty, it will continue to have no substantial voice at the academic table, which I think is the most crucial thing missing. If we had a curriculum, we’d have a full-time faculty, which is what we need … Dance should have the same freedom and rights as theater."
A BALANCING ACT
However much has been left to do in terms of improving dance’s status at Harvard, Bergmann succeeded in showing students that it is possible to pursue dance in addition to more conventional academic and career options. Like Koch, Julia Havard ‘11, a student choreographer and member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company, says Bergmann inspired her to consider pursuing the arts in her years after college. "I was always planning to go straight to med school, but now I’m planning on choreographing for a couple of years first. Liz can really get away with saying things like ‘Listen to your heart and do what you feel." Koch found Bergmann similarly inspiring. "[Liz] is proof that you can do something substantive with dance as a career, that you can make a successful life that way," she says.
Bergmann’s influence has had an equally significant role for those who have always considered dance a career path. "The balance that Liz struck with having strong extracurricular dance, in which everyone could participate, as well as great curricular offerings, is incredible," says Walker. Koch also credits Bergmann with a dramatic influx of serious dancers to Harvard in the past few years. "It’s becoming more common for people who can do dance professionally to come here, maybe taking time off sometime during their four years. Once I heard a prefrosh say she wanted to come to Harvard specifically for the dance program, I knew things had really changed," she says. Immensely talented and committed dancers such Madelyn M.L. Ho ‘08, who currently dances with the second company of Paul Taylor, Joanna R. Binney ‘08, who is a company member of the Jose Mateo Ballet Theatre, and Merritt M. Moore ‘11, who has taken time off to dance with Zurich Ballet and Boston Ballet, have decided to attend Harvard during Bergmann’s tenure.
SEEING THE WHOLE PICTURE
In addition to her efficacy in advocating for dance within Harvard, Bergmann has played an important personal role as a mentor and teacher to individual student dancers. "Liz has an amazing ability to make dancers really excited about what they’re doing. When we went on tour [as the Harvard Contemporary Dance Ensemble] to the American College Dance Festival, and we were the only group there not from a dance conservatory, she still really made us feel like we had a purpose being there," says Walker. "She always referred to us as ‘the company,’ and she really rallied us."
Her influence as a teacher lay primarily in her ability to couple a broad vision for the ultimate impact of a piece with great analytical facility. "Liz is both very critical and very supportive at the same time," says Havard. "The way I choreograph has completely changed at Harvard thanks to her … She taught me to step back and see the whole picture, and to realize that sometimes accidents are when the most creative things happen—and that sometimes moments that weren’t purposeful were the most honest." Koch says Bergmann is uniquely able concretize her technical knowledge in clear, complete thoughts about a piece’s overall effect. "Liz has an impeccable editing ability," she says. "She is always able to put her finger on the crux of what needs to change, or what is good, about a piece of dance. She showed me how to take a couple of steps back, look at a piece objectively and revisit principles that you sometimes forget when you’re wrapped up in what you’re making, and in that way she really changed my choreographic approach."
Many students who worked with Bergmann will cherish their time with her for a long time to come. "The way Liz passed on the benefits of her lifetime of experience to everyone here was incredible," says Koch, "and one of the most important parts of her impact." For Havard, Bergmann’s influence is persistent. "When I choreograph, I still hear her voice in my head," she says. "I will always treasure the time I’ve had with her, and Harvard will certainly not be the same without her."
UNFINISHED BUSINESS
When reflecting upon the changes Harvard dance has undergone during her time here, Bergmann doesn’t hesitate to recognize the enormous challenges left to whoever becomes her successor. "Harvard students deserve wonderful programs, and shouldn’t be torn between dance and academics. It’s up to the new director to be a strong advocate, to continue building courses, and especially to work with the reality that sometimes, it really is about money, and less about whether we believe in an idea or not but about committing money to it." In particular, she emphasizes the importance of raising the status of dance as a serious field of study. "There are big challenges ahead for all arts, but dance is still the low man on the totem pole since it came so late onto the academic setting at Harvard. There are now lots of singular dance departments at universities across the board, and perhaps we should look to them to learn about how we can improve."
In spite of these remaining obstacles, however, Bergmann feels she has done her part by bringing her particular abilities as a director, administrator, and artist to Harvard, and believes she had a positive impact. "I’ve spent my career building university dance programs, and that was what I wanted to achieve for Harvard. I see myself as more of a builder than a maintainer, so maybe it will be up to someone else to keep dance at Harvard going." As the testimonies of her students show, Bergmann constructed a strong foundation upon which the next Dance Director can build.

When did you first learn ballet?
Ballet dancer Merritt A. Moore ’10-’11 is a physics concentrator affiliated with Currier House, though she currently lives off campus. In 2008, she took a year off to dance with the Zurich Ballet Company, and performed last fall with the Boston Ballet Company. She now dances with the Harvard Ballet Company.


The Harvard Crimson:
Merritt Moore: I was thirteen, and I had been a gymnast for two years but I just didn’t have the body type. I was too gangly and I kept breaking everything. I actually hated ballet because I thought of myself as a tomboy and then my mom bribed me—she said I could get my ears pierced if I did a year of ballet. So I did it, and it was really hardcore: the Russian ballet masters were always yelling "catasroph! Catastroph!" I decided that I was going to quit, but then I went to Italy and there was this Romanian ballet teacher. It was like a boot camp, but I have gone back six times to train with her since.
THC: Can you tell me about the time you spent with the Zurich Ballet Company?
MM: Harvard, even though it doesn’t have a dance department and dance is under the radar, still had all of these amazing opportunities for me to perform—works that only principle dancers from the best companies would ever be able to perform. I had these on video and I used them to audition. I decided after sophomore year that it’s now or never. So I decided to go to Europe and audition. Zurich was actually my top choice. The first time I went, they had 250 dancers show up from all around the world, and after every combination they would go through all of the dancers saying "thank you very much, thank you very much," to take people out. At the end they just said, "we are not taking anyone." But then I got another follow-up, asking if would come and audition, and I got in.
THC: And what about your time with the Boston Ballet Company this year?
MM: I jumped in, they had already started rehearsing a month before and they hired me starting in September. So not only had I taken a full year off, and been working in a lab eight hours a day, seven days a week over the summer, but I also had taken a trip to the Middle East where there was no dance at all, so I was completely not prepared. We had to do "La Bayadère", which is a three hour ballet—a very long ballet. It was so hard, and all of the other girls had already known each other and they had been rehearsing for a month, and here I am—poor Harvard physics kid wandering around the back wondering, "where am I going? That way? What are we doing?" But I made it through and didn’t fall.
THC: Is there a difference between ballet in America and ballet in Europe?
MM: In the ballet schools of Europe, especially the schools which pre-select girls, there is such an emphasis on technique and perfection. To be good, you have to be exactly like the girl next to you, exactly like the girl behind you. In America, there is that, but it’s also about pushing as much as you can. This is good in certain respects, but can also encourage dance which is sometimes sloppy.
THC: What do you plan on doing with dance after graduation?
MM: Next fall I will be applying to graduate school for physics, and now I’m just focusing on that. I still dance to enjoy myself, and I would someday like to bring dance to the Middle East to bring art and self-expression to women.
THC: How do you feel about the media’s portrayal of dance and the ballet world in particular? Do movies like "Black Swan" influence the public’s opinion of you?
MM: Even though the dance world is often negatively portrayed, and all you ever hear about is anorexia, bulimia, and controlling mothers, it is, quite frankly, completely off. But it’s great for the audience to become more aware of dance, and how much work it really is. The audience develops an eye for what’s good and what’s bad, and ballet often provides a base for other types of dance. There is technique and purity to the form. It is like studying the classics instead of modern works—there is something authentic and pure in it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In a panel discussion at the Carpenter Center on February 3, recent alumnae from Harvard’s VES department offered encouraging words to students considering careers in the visual arts. The discussion, entitled ‘Object Lessons,’ brought together Xiaowei Wang ’08, Meredith E. James ’04 and Liz Glynn ’03 to discuss what life outside the classroom can hold for Harvard students interested in becoming professional artists. The talk coincided with the opening of an exhibit featuring installations from all three artists, which will be on display in the Carpenter Center until Feb. 20. The exhibit, also entitled ‘Object Lessons,’ includes mixed media projects, video installations, and a reconstruction of architect Le Corbusier’s furniture using materials from the demolished Fogg Art Museum. The exhibit even features an on-site installation which explores the natural environment around the Carpenter Center.
In discussing their respective paths toward artistic development, the three panelists described both their past projects and those currently on display.
For Wang, the importance of travel has continually shaped her work. Many of her pieces focus on the concept of cultural identity, an idea she has explored through her various voyages abroad. Upon graduating in 2008, Wang spent several months traveling the world, passing through Berlin before finishing her journey in Beijing. There, she observed the nation’s post-Olympic environment, and was disturbed by the wastefulness she noticed around her. Struck by "how much stuff we have, and how much refuse we don’t use," Wang channeled her frustration into the art she created while abroad.
This theme of waste and physical detritus represented a common thread in the works of all three artists. For Glynn, waste materials provide a strong connection to the past, evoking history in an engaging manner. One of her most significant projects in recent years is a video entitled "The 24 Hour Rome Reconstruction Project," which depicts a team of artists rebuilding Rome in a day, using only recycled materials. The team builds a Rome of rubbish at the rate of roughly 1.238 years per minute, only to tear it down later that night. The video, which has been screened in New York and L.A., is now on display in the Carpenter Center. She adds that it wasn’t just Harvard’s VES department which prepared her for this project. "My experience outside VES came into play, such as being a DJ at WHRB, which helped me in booking bands to perform in the art piece."
James also explored the medium of video after graduating from Harvard. While studying for her MFA at Yale, James was encouraged to move away from her fascination with old British architecture and explore video representations of them instead. This led James to experiment with what she termed "primitive video techniques," helping her produce pieces of engaging art that deal with scale, height, and perception. "Video makes things so magical. It’s so fluid and takes no effort at all," James said, reflecting on the new outlook that shaped her project. She expressed excitement at being encouraged to think in a different artistic way. Taking time off between graduating college and attending graduate school also aided her development.
In addition to discussing their specific projects, the three Harvard graduates spoke more generally about the life of a visual artist, the hardships one may face in the real world, and the struggles that even success can bring. James joked, "I was having exhibitions in my apartment, until I got evicted. But then we had an eviction exhibition". Glynn offered a similar sentiment, saying that graduating wasn’t easy, but "working six days a week in a regular job and then working every night in the studio made me realize how much I wanted to do this."
Perhaps in Glynn’s enthusiasm lies the best piece of advice: doing what you love may be difficult, but it is often worth the risk. Indeed, those with enough passion, determination and creativity can follow in the footsteps of other Harvard artists, and carve out a niche for themselves in the world of visual art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the Freshman Arts Advisory Board (FAAB) has one mission, it is to provide intense Harvard students with not-so-intense artistic downtime. Recognizing that students, and especially freshmen, can be intimidated by the heavy time commitments required by extracurricular organizations and semester-long VES courses, FAAB has organized a wide array of spring workshops to help first-year students engage with the arts. To celebrate the initiative’s official debut, the newly-formed board hosted "A FAAB Affair," an interactive arts extravaganza which was held on Thursday, February 3.
During the event, many freshmen enthusiastically shared their wide range of skills with others by giving mini-workshops. Several small classrooms in the basement of Memorial Hall were filled with students trying out a range of activities, from origami to juggling to cake decorating.
FAAB is the brainchild of Rory M. Sullivan’09, the newly instated Director of Residential Education at the Freshman Dean’s Office. One of Sullivan’s first projects was to gather fifteen freshmen to serve on the Board, which is designed to help fellow first-years both navigate and also reshape arts opportunities on campus.
"I wanted to get freshmen excited for the arts," says Sullivan. "So when I decided to initiate the FAAB and asked for applications, I asked them what they thought we could improve, and what they thought were important priorities." From this initial feedback, two main goals were formed: find a low-key way for freshmen to participate in the arts, and provide more exhibition space for student art.
These specific objectives are reflective of the broader emphasis which Harvard’s administration has placed on arts education in recent years. As Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 explains, "academics are the centerpiece for freshmen but we wanted freshmen to grow on all fronts." In particular, he notes that the administration "thought that if they offered more arts opportunities, there would be enthusiastic participants. This also aligns with the attention that President Faust has directed to the arts at Harvard."
For now, these arts opportunities will primarily take the form of 4- to 8-week long workshops on topics ranging from Photoshop to pantomime. Beginning in the second week of February, six limited-enrollment workshops will allow students to "dabble" in making docudramas, creative writing, and even using the Bow & Arrow letterpress.
"It can be hard to break into the arts scene at Harvard as a freshman if you’re not already part of a group," says FAAB member Sarina M. Patterson ’14. "That’s the nature of Harvard. You have to comp everything. It’s hard to be involved with the arts if you just want to get a taste of it."
While the Office for the Arts (OFA) does offer beginner-level arts courses which are open to all students, FAAB seeks to build an inviting creative environment which specifically caters to first-years. The Board also wanted to increase freshman presence in the college’s annual Arts First festival, so they have reserved Annenberg for a May 1 showcase dedicated exclusively to freshman art.
Even with all of its enthusiastic support and exciting ideas, FAAB is still in its formative stages as a group and is open-ended in its plans for evolution. In the future, the Board hopes to offer career development resources for aspiring artists. "We’re hoping to organize talks like ‘Integrating the Arts into Your Career’ panels, where we would invite people to talk about how to integrate arts into professions in government, medicine, or even public service," Sullivan says.
For now, freshmen can explore new types of art in the spring workshops and at informal events like "A FAAB Affair". "I think it’s so great when students encounter a different art form that is made to feel accessible," said Marin J. Orlosky-Randow ’07-’08, now an instructor in the OFA’s Dance Program. "FAAB did a great job with the timing of this event because freshmen are probably overwhelmed with information in the first semester of college, and now is a good break to get people excited about the arts again."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the media’s response to the tragic massacre of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and others in Tucson, Ariz. on Jan. 8 focused largely on right-wing rhetoric, the incident has also renewed calls for tougher gun laws. A bill introduced on Jan. 18 by U.S. Rep. Carolyn C. McCarthy (D., N.Y.), which is cosponsored by 65 congressmen, is similar to the Clinton-era Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) that the Republican Congress allowed to expire in 2004. The Obama administration voiced its support for reinstating the AWB during its first hundred days, and Newsweek reports that the White House is soon to unveil “a new gun control effort.” The trouble is that the ban would not have prevented the Tucson shooting, and even if it had, this by itself would not be a valid reason for its reinstatement.
The AWB, enacted in 1994, imposed a 10-year ban on the manufacture, transfer, or possession of 19 models of semi-automatic assault weapons-military-style guns for which the trigger is pulled for each shot fired. It also banned the transfer or possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Importantly, the law exempted weapons and magazines lawfully possessed prior to the date of enactment.
Contrary to what has been reported by gun control advocates and much of the media, the crime perpetrated by crazed Tucson resident Jared Lee Loughner is very unlikely to have been prevented by the AWB. The assailant’s weapon, a nine-millimeter Glock 19 pistol with 31-round magazines, was not banned by the law. What was banned was the transfer or possession of new large-capacity magazines, which, as Kevin D. Williamson explains in National Review, remained commonplace during the AWB. Harvard economist Jeffrey A. Miron notes in Businessweek that Loughner could have carried out his attack with high-capacity magazines sold before the ban took effect, or purchased one on the black market. Or he could have simply carried multiple (legal) guns so as to fire continuously. The AWB might have made Loughner’s rampage a bit more difficult, but it would hardly have stopped him.
The focus on the impact the AWB would have had in the Loughner case is misguided for another reason: Gun policy should aim to minimize aggregate crime. How a law operates at the micro level, as in the Tucson massacre, is relevant only insofar as it helps us understand the law’s broader impact. The appropriate question to ask in deciding whether to reinstate the AWB is not whether it would prevent certain isolated incidents, but the extent to which it would reduce overall crime, and whether this reduction outweighs the cost of imposing such a ban.
Academic literature does not provide consistent evidence that such restrictions reduce crime, and analyses frequently conclude that they have little if any effect. With respect to the AWB, a 2004 University of Pennsylvania study noted that assault weapons were rarely used in gun crimes before the ban and that the reduction in violence that would result from renewing the law, while nontrivial, was likely to be “small at best.”
Saving even one life would be nontrivial, but whatever reduction in violence accrues from the law must be weighed against its associated costs. Permitting semiautomatic weapons for the sake of recreation, or even the principle of constitutional rights, might appear ridiculous if it comes at the cost of human life. What is not ridiculous is the fact that enforcing any law requires resources; in this case, the state must pay for the prosecution of lawbreakers in terms of the training and wages of law enforcement personnel and court costs. Given the mediocre record of gun control in general and of the AWB in particular, these funds might be better spent improving enforcement of existing gun laws, treating victims of gun violence, educating the public about gun safety, or serving unrelated purposes. Given what we know about Jared Lee Loughner, they might be better spent on mental health services. Furthermore, any attempt at gun control is likely to give rise to a black market, which, as in the illicit drug trade, breeds violence inasmuch as market participants cannot resolve disputes through the judicial system. And stricter controls than the AWB might limit the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves against criminals.
Perhaps the most significant cost of this or any gun control law is that it opens the door to further restrictions that may be less reasonable. The best evidence of this is the United Kingdom, which at the beginning of the twentieth century had hardly any restrictions on the right to arms and now imposes virtually outright prohibition. The transition to the control regime was fueled by media focus on isolated gun crimes , which politicians used as justification for ever tighter restrictions.
While it goes without saying that the government should try to prevent incidents like the Tucson shooting, citizens should realize that some degree of gun violence is inevitable regardless of laws Congress passes, and that public policy faces tradeoffs between gun crime reduction and other objectives. Whatever policy the government adopts should be an attempt to maximize aggregate living standards with available resources, and should not be a visceral reaction to one unfortunate event.

If you travel across the river to Lavietes Pavilion to watch the Harvard men’s basketball team compete, you won’t see a slew of players who will one day play for the Boston Celtics or a team that will dethrone Duke to win the NCAA championship.
But that’s not to say there isn’t a lot to see.
This season, the Crimson is poised to do something never before achieved in Harvard history: win an Ivy League championship. Of the eight teams in the Ancient Eight, Harvard is the only program without a championship banner hanging from its rafters. But after a strong performance in non-conference play, it looks like this could be the year the Crimson changes that.
But the possibility of a title is not the main reason you should care about Harvard basketball. You should care about Harvard basketball because it competes in the Ivy League—the most unique basketball conference in the country.
The Ivy League sets itself apart by ensuring that its athletes have a consummate college experience while maintaining their athletic commitments. While athletes from other conferences receive special benefits—such as athletic scholarships and access to special housing—Ivy League players enjoy no such perks. Ivy League players don’t even get to skip class for games since 12 out of 14 conference matchups are held on Friday and Saturday nights. 
When a player steps on the court at Lavietes Pavilion with “Harvard” stitched across his jersey, you can be sure that he is experiencing the same Harvard as the tuba player in the band, the cheerleader under the basket, and the fan in the fifth row of the student section. At Harvard where he is treated the same as every other student, and is able to take advantage of Harvard’s offerings in the same way as his peers. The same cannot be said for players in many other highly visible college basketball programs such as the University of Kentucky, where players treat the school as a one-year pit stop before entering the NBA.
Furthermore, the Ivy League has no conference tournament, or a postseason competition to crown its champion, which is a consistent tradition across every other league in the country. The Ivy League title, on the other hand—and the conference’s automatic berth in the NCAA tournament—is awarded to the team that finishes the regular season with the best record. This makes every regular season game, whether it’s against the league’s top dog or against the cellar dweller, of crucial importance; a single slip up could spell an end to a team’s championship hopes.
Questions such as whether the Harvard men’s basketball team sends another player like Jeremy Lin ’10 to the NBA and whether the team wins its first Ivy League championship are exciting, but it’s not the only reason we should care about the Crimson as it enters the heart of conference play.
Instead, we should care because it’s the Ivy League—the conference which demands that its athletes accomplish as students and which shuns marquee tournaments in favor of everyday play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Obama administration is getting organized about innovation. Last Monday, the White House held a public-private sector press conference launching “Startup America,” a joint-venture between government leaders and leading corporations such as Google, IBM and Facebook to reignite a core value of American culture: innovation. This aligns with the State of the Union address in which Obama prioritized innovation as a way to create jobs, start companies and make America economically competitive again.
This new prioritization of innovation coincides with recent groundswell of activity at Harvard College. It seems that every computer science concentrator and their roommate has an exciting, new start-up. Yet, the action is not limited to Maxwell Dworkin. Jonah Varon ’13 and Axel Hansen ’13 created Newsle on their own time and got attention in TechCrunch. Jackson Kernion ’12 created On Topic@Harvard. Seth Riddley ’12 did not take any computer science classes to code HarvardLunch, a simple idea so profound that Yale and the Unniversity of Pennsylvania have asked him to set it up on their campuses. However great the bottom-up enthusiasm for innovation, there is a need for top-down support: greater resources, more mentorship, and most importantly (and symbolically), a Harvard hub. The energetic Harvard innovators often take the T to Kendall to find an outlet for their passions. A recent Flybridge Capital Cues & Brews Billiards event drew top Boston entrepreneurs to 1 Kendall Square, a huge, converted factory. Many Harvard alumni were there offering advice. One Facebook co-founder was also there, not playing pool, but planning to set up shop in Boston for his next venture.
That all of this activity occurred outside of Harvard demonstrates our lack of an suitable hub for Boston’s innovators. As a further sign of the fertile start-up culture in Cambridge, Microsoft established the New England Research and Development Center near Kendall Square in September 2007. The innovation culture is not limited to universities and corporations. A comparable public sector movement is in the works. In April 2010, leaders came together at 1 Marina Park Drive and organized MassChallenge, a competition that helps transform big ideas into businesses and draws Boston’s top group of investors, entrepreneurs, lawyers, corporate executives and government leaders. They’ve won sponsorship from the Massachusetts Governor, and even accolades from President Barack H. Obama.
Over the past six months, student-run initiatives like Hack Harvard, Harvard College Venture Partners, Quincy’s Q-Combinator, Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, TEDxHarvard, and others have reinvigorated the startup scene on campus. This energy follows in the footsteps of two technology “startups” that trace their roots back to the College and have dominated in two separate decades: Microsoft in the 90s, and Facebook in the last. Much of this renaissance was the result of the Hack Harvard incubation that lasted over one-week in unused Office of Career Services Interview Facility space. Computer Science 50 Professor David J. Malan ’99 has played a remarkable role in this new innovation ecosystem, establishing a Computer Science 50 lounge, even obtaining a HUDS kiosk for students to hack, and continually pushing the envelope with the administration. Malan, along with other energized faculty members, alumni, and OCS, have proven that the administration can support us in a big way.
Administrators and students often classify innovative technologies as they do the weather: uncontrollable, unpredictable. We often hear people ask who’ll be the next Mark Zuckerberg, as if the Harvard admissions committee invented Facebook. This misses the essence of innovation. Innovation is not about picking the next Zuckerberg, but rather fostering the type of community in which a Zuckerberg can thrive.  Innovation, unlike the weather, can be encouraged; Harvard can make it rain.
The first step to harnessing the zeal of its undergraduates is to provide a proper environment. Many candidates in past Undergraduate Council elections have made it their campaign priority to create more social and collaborative spaces on campus. Imagine a social hub where top tech minds, those interested in business, passionate about social justice, curious about sustainable foods, or keen to invent a better way to plan parties, can get together and launch smart, successful ventures. In the spirit of Xerox PARC or Bell Labs, Harvard Business School recently launched the Harvard Innovation Lab being catered to graduate students. A similar facility should be created at the College. Here, experienced alumni can lend support and capital; marketing teams can have a home; students can serendipitously meet, trade ideas and lend skills. All of this can be done with or without the administration’s help. Obama has made his move. We ask students, professors, deans and administrators of the College: What is yours?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past December, Brown University’s Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies issued a statement recommending that Brown not reinvest in HEI Hotels and Resorts, a prominent hospitality investment company often charged with mistreating workers. In an e-mailed statement to the Brown’s Student Labor Alliance, Luiz F. Valente, Chair of ACCRIP, wrote that, given the "persistent pattern" of allegations against HEI, the situation raised questions about whether Brown's association with such a company was consistent with the ethical principles intended to govern its investments.
HEI Hotels and Resorts owns and operates 30 hotels in the U.S.; the company values its real estate holdings at $2 billion. It boasts $1.2 billion in equity funding from “prestigious university endowments,” which contribute to a private discretionary fund that HEI uses to acquire new hotels quickly and efficiently. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton all invest in the fund.
Unfortunately, as Brown’s corporate responsibility body reported, HEI’s workers have complained of mistreatment; pro-union activists within the labor core have especially complained of harassment by the company’s management. The letter names one case in which the company agreed to reinstate a dismissed worker who had been encouraging unionization. Additionally, a report by United Students Against Sweatshops cites that workers at a number of HEI locations claim that the company saves money by paring back staff to an unreasonable level.
In response, student groups at a number of universities who are involved in HEI have urged their administrations to reconsider the investments, including Harvard’s Student Action Labor Movement, the Notre Dame Campus Labor Action Project, Princeton for Workers’ Rights, the University of Pennsylvania Student Labor Action Project, University of Chicago Students for a Democratic Society, University of Chicago Students Organizing United with Labor, and Vanderbilt Students for Non-Violence.
This should go without saying, but Harvard should advocate for workers' rights in the companies it invests in. Unions play a valuable role in maintaining fair working standards for employees, and the allegations that HEI is hindering their presence within its hotels should call Harvard’s relations with the company into question. Additionally, while we understand that any company that acquires and manages labor-intensive businesses necessarily needs to be concerned with cost-cutting, we expect that this does not come at the expense of decent treatment for workers. Although many of the universities that invest in HEI have also recently experienced allegations of worker mistreatment—including Harvard—labor rights violations of any kind are inconsistent with Harvard’s standard of social responsibility.
In this vein, the Brown University committee’s efforts at investigating the situation with HEI are to be commended, as its courage to act on its findings and take a stance against HEI.
As to how Harvard should respond, the right course of action has yet to become clear.
On the one hand, we feel that divestment would be an inappropriate course of action. Although allegations of worker mistreatment are unsettling, they are hardly on the scale of the other atrocities that have led the Harvard Management Corporation to divestment, a rare occurrence in the University's history. Examples of past "divestments" include Harvard's partial divestment from apartheid South Africa in the 1980s and, in 2005, from PetroChina, a firm whose state-owned parent company had worked extensively with the Sudanese government to produce oil at the same time as that government was accused of having committed genocide. These circumstances far transcend the scope of worker mistreatment, and divestment in every ethically ambiguous situation might very well diminish what should be a profound gesture.
On the other hand, Harvard is an institution with significant financial influence and a strong interest in social responsibility, and--if worker mistreatment cannot be called as "serious" as apartheid or genocide--perhaps it is time to abandon such a rigid calculus altogether. Indeed, in the future, HMC might consider a more liberal policy for divestment proceedings to ensure a more socially responsible endowment. At this point, we do not advocate immediate divestment from an investment such as HEI, but Harvard’s administration should seriously consider whether this may become a more palatable response in the future. In a sense, weighing which wrongs are more worthy of public reproach seems as anachronistic as it does beside the point, for wrongs are wrongs that must be acknowledged as such.
Although Brown ACCRIP findings are startling, however, before Harvard refuses to re-invest in HEI, it should conduct its own investigation into HEI policies and practices. Relying on Brown's findings is simply not enough, even though if HEI is truly below Brown’s standards of ethical investment, it is likely below Harvard’s as well. In the months that come, we call on HMC's Committee on Shareholder Responsibility--the HMC’s social responsibility organ--to investigate the allegations against HEI at its spring 2011 session. If the CCSR does find a basis for claims of worker mistreatment, we urge it to issue a statement emphasizing that Harvard will no longer tolerate labor rights abuses by this particular company. After all, it has the unique ability to request that the companies HMC invests in reform practices deemed unethical under threat of non-reinvestment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not every day that a public hearing turns into a celebration filled with food and live music. But that’s what happened at yesterday’s meeting of the Cambridge City Council.
After brief discussions of bond ratings, potential land acquisition, and negotiations with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation—plus an unusual, approximately thirty-minute executive session held behind closed doors—the council took time to wish two of their own a happy birthday.
Councillor Leland Cheung, who is pursuing a degree at the Harvard Kennedy School, was the first to be wished a happy birthday with the passage of Resolution #11.
“I’m pleased that Councilor Cheung and I share the same astrological sign,” said Kenneth E. Reeves ’72.
Then, surprising Reeves, Mayor David P. Maher, on behalf of the entire city council, brought forth a late-order resolution wishing Reeves a happy 60th birthday.
“Whereas: No city councillor enjoys celebrating their birthday more than our colleague Ken Reeves,” he said.
“The exact year of Ken Reeves birth is questionable as he does not look a day over forty years old.”
Reeves responded to the resolution by saying, “Mayor Maher, I’ll vote for you next time.”
City employees rolled out a lit birthday cake on a cart, joking that they should have a fire marshal present. Then the council began singing “Happy Birthday.”
There was a bit of serious business on the agenda, however. The meeting concluded with discussions over snow removal, improved communication between police and residents, and a debate over the utility of the Yellow Pages. The council forwarded a resolution to the City Manager seeking more information on the feasibility of a phone book opt-out/opt-in program that would reduce costs associated with waste.
“I used the Yellow Pages today for a bakery,” Maher said, commenting on the publication’s relevance to many segments of the population. “Try the cake.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mitchell Reich, a second year at Harvard Law School, was elected the first openly gay president of the Harvard Law Review. Reich, a Yale College and Dalton School graduate and Manhattan native, is the 125th president of the esteemed publication.
BREAKING GROUND
Reich says that being gay is a non-issue for the Harvard Law Review community, but that he recognizes the significance of the election. He says that while he was in high school, before coming out of the closet, he found it hard to picture achieving his dreams and be gay at the same time.
“If I had seen someone who was the president of the Harvard Law Review and [also] openly gay, that would have been helpful to me,” Reich says.
Ryan C. Reich, Mitchell’s older brother and a sixth year graduate student pursuing a Ph.D in the math department at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said that while his brother is certainly an advocate for gay rights, his sexual orientation is “not a cause” for the second year law student.
“I don’t think it affects his approach to work or his legal mind,” says Reich. “He does certainly have a certain affinity for gay rights issues ... but I think, first, that this is part of a larger affinity for liberal thought.”
SETTLING IN
The office of the president of the Harvard Law Review is not as grandiose as the elite status of the title might suggest. On the third floor of the Georgian-style Gannett House—up two flights of steep, winding stairs covered in faded grey carpet—the office is barely more than an alcove, away from the bustle of activity in the common quarters. Red volumes of past issues are stacked around the room, and a few posters and phone numbers are tacked onto the wall around the desk. The only noise is the ticking of the black clock hung on the wall to the left of the desk.
One week into his tenure as president, Reich has yet to make the coveted office his own. He says he might as well—mentioning he plans to put up pictures, including one of his baby half-sister Haley—considering the amount of time he will spend in the room. Every day in the past week, he has arrived at Gannett between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. and left no earlier than 10 p.m., leaving for pockets of time to attend class.
As president, Reich will play the role of the editor-in-chief—overseeing the publication of both in-house and scholarly articles in the review—and of managing the staff and external relations. He says that, as president, he intends to continue the expansion of the web edition of the law review, transforming the web version into a valuable tool for scholars and an online mecca for scholarly discourse and debate. Reich also says he wants to be more conscientious about the length of legal articles—keeping articles at around 25,000 and below 30,000 words. But above all, Reich says he wanted to continue to produce a first-rate publication.
“My predecessor and the class before is a tough act to follow,” Reich says, going on to explain that he hoped to keep the tradition of excellence alive in the eight issues he would oversee as president.
AUTHOR AT AGE THREE
Family and friends note that Reich’s election as president is a reflection of another tradition of excellence—his own. Reich has been articulate, passionate, and an exemplary leader since an early age, they say.
“When Mitch was in Kindergarten, he was writing books,” says his mother, Diane Cohen, referring to short picture books with plots and drawings her son started making from age three. “His teacher excused him from naptime, saying he was an author and had more important things to do than nap.”
Reich was student body president his senior year at Dalton, and has worked for the gubernatorial and presidential campaigns of Eliot L. Spitzer and Barack Obama respectively, in addition to interning with New York Senator Charles E. Schumer.
Reich’s college roommates of four years Brent Lowry said that Reich’s election was exciting news, but not at all surprising.
“Mitch is absolutely accessible, engaging, and knows how to challenge you on an intellectual level,” says Lowry.

The man accused of stabbing another man on Saturday morning near the intersection of Mt. Auburn and Holyoke Streets was identified by the police as Ivan Bacai, a 21-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., according to a Cambridge Police Department incident report.
A disturbance was reported in the area of Mass. Ave. and Dunster Street before the male victim, 36, was stabbed twice, once in the chest and another time in the lower abdomen at about 2:49 a.m.
Witnesses told police that a fight between the victim and two females took place. Then, three males came to the scene and allegedly attacked the victim.
Raymond Pina, the Cambridge police officer who reported the incident, wrote that he found a male with blood soaked clothing and a large gash “bleeding profusely” on the right side of his face when Pina arrived at Mass. Ave. and Holyoke Street.
According to the report, the victim was accompanied by two males, who stated “almost simultaneously”: “Man, he just got his ass kicked.”
Pina asked the victim to lift his shirt and confirmed a knife wound to the right side of the victim’s abdomen.
The victim was transported to a hospital and taken into surgery. At the time of the report, the victim was declared in “critical condition.”
The two males, age 19 and 39, described the suspect to Pina, who then reported the description over the police radio system. Shortly afterward, a male matching the description was stopped in front of the Hong Kong restaurant by another officer. An identification interview was conducted with both witnesses.
One witness told Pina that the victim was “somewhat sexually assaultive,” according to the report, stating that the victim tried to touch the two females.
The two females alledgedly started attacking the victim and shoved him to the ground. Then three males came running and began kicking the victim in the head, face, and lower parts of his upper torso, according to the two witnesses.
One witness stated that the males then fled up Holyoke Street toward Mass. Ave., while the two females fled down Mt. Auburn Steet toward Central Square.
The suspect was arrested and charged with armed assault to murder.
The incident is currently undergoing an “extremely active investigation” by the Cambridge Police Department.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Without even receiving a single interview, Lisa Boes was once rejected for a resident tutor position at every single House she applied to.
Today Boes is the resident dean of Pforzheimer House and shared her story of rejection and success as a panelist at an event titled “Reflections on Rejections” at the Office of Career Services yesterday.
“I have never taken any front door to anything that’s really important,” Boes said. “I found another angle to do it or found a way for it to be available.
Head football coach Tim Murphy and Hurlbut proctor Rory Michelle Sullivan ’09 joined Boes as panelists at the event, moderated by Bureau of Study Counsel Director Abigail Lipson. Murphy and Sullivan also shared their personal experiences with rejection before opening up the floor to questions from students.
“We are interested in finding and creating a context for people to talk about resilience and persistence and decisions and comforting oneself—all the things that are involved in coping with rejections and failures and setbacks in our life,” said Lipson, who created and began offering the program three years ago.
In addition to a button that read “REJECTED” in bold red letters, attendees at the workshop also received a brochure that included a collection of thirty stories of failure and success from Harvard affiliates and an instructional packet by Lipson entitled, “How To Have a Really Successful Failure.”
Murphy is the first athletic coach invited to serve as a panelist, and his inclusion reflected a desire to incorporate all types of rejection experiences into the discussion, according to Lipson.
“Athletes deal with issues of success and failure all the time,” Lipson said. “In athletics, [the issue] can be more salient sometimes because it is an explicitly more competitive environment.”
A graduate student, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she attended the event after recently having dealt with many instances of rejection.
“It’s been helpful to go to people for advice and thinking, ‘Don’t let failures be totally pointless,’” she said. “It’s been encouraging to hear other people have had successes and rethinking my failures.”
Christine S. An ’11 said she found the event was an opportunity to discover the purpose of rejection and how to turn her failures into successes.
“I learned that rejections are not as bad as you think they are and are great opportunities for learning about yourself,” An said.
When the program ended, some attendees rushed to the front to thank the panelists, while others posed more personal questions.
“At the end of the day, the most important thing you could do in dealing with rejection,” Murphy said, “is to believe in yourself and try again—with the risk of still getting your heart broken.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A final conference was held yesterday before the upcoming April 4 trial of one of the four defendants charged in association with the killing of a Cambridge resident in the basement of Kirkland House in May 2009.
The defense lawyer for Jabrai J. Copney requested a hearing to reconsider evidence at yesterday’s pre-trial conference at the Middlesex Superior Court. Copney was not in attendance, according to Middlesex District Attorney Spokesperson Cara O’Brien.
Copney was one of three men from New York City who were charged almost two years ago in the murder of Justin Cosby, a Cambridge resident also unaffiliated with Harvard.
Jason Aquino, Blayn Jiggetts, and Copney all pleaded not guilty to the murder.
The shooting took place on May 18, 2009 in the basement of Kirkland House’s J-entryway. Cosby was shot during what investigators called a failed “drug rip.”
Brittany J. Smith, a former Harvard student and girlfriend of Copney who was implicated in the shooting, pled not guilty to charges of accessory after the fact of murder and illegal possession of a firearm. Smith allegedly gave Copney her Harvard ID which provided all three men access to Kirkland.
Additionally, Smith allegedly hid the murder weapon, lied to the police, and mislead a grand jury.
On the day of the shooting, Smith called a cab and used the driver’s phone to help the three men escape, said Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85 in a press release about the case in March 2010.
The group went to South Station to take a bus to New York, Leone said.
Upon returning to Harvard, Smith—then a senior in Lowell House—falsely reported to police that her boyfriend’s name was Jordan Coombs and that he had left the University hours before the murder, according to Leone.
Outside of the four individuals charged in connection with the case, undergraduate Chanequa N. Campbell was asked to leave Harvard for alleged connections to the incident. She has denied any involvement and has not been charged to date.
Copney’s attorney John A. Amabile declined to comment on the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A touchscreen gadget the size of a Moleskine notebook sits propped up at the end of the table at Uno Chicago Grill. It’s not on every table, but certain returning customers ask to be seated where they’re placed.
During the busy lunch service at Au Bon Pain, employees greet customers and take customized sandwich orders using iPads. While customers wait for their sandwiches to be made, they can purchase a bowl of soup or order a freshly tossed salad.
A new iPhone application allows commuters to order and pay before even arriving at Zoe’s. The order is prepared and ready for the customer on the counter for a quick grab and go.
In a world of smartphones, iPads, and other quickly advancing mobile technologies, many restaurants in Harvard Square have devised innovative ways to keep up. Integrating new technology into their ordering systems, these cutting-edge restaurants seek the help of new devices to provide faster, simpler, and even more secure service.
INCREASING ORDERING EFFICIENCY
A longtime restaurant in Harvard Square, the Au Bon Pain at 1360 Mass. Ave. began using iPads to take orders at the end of January.
“When there’s a rush, the manager will shout for an iPad and then someone will jump to the front with one and start taking orders,” says Michael H. Cleland, general manager of the Harvard Square location.
Before this system, which has been available at the Kendall location for several months, Au Bon Pain customers wrote their orders by checking off a form at the sandwich counter during busy dining hours.
This new system saves the stores about 1,200 full sheets of paper a day, Cleland says, and provides a more efficient and cleaner way to take orders since restaurant workers are the only ones touching the iPads.
“It’s all about engaging with the guest, and we’ve done that by pairing service with this new technology,” Cleland says.
About a minute away at the new Clover Food Lab on 7 Holyoke St., servers use iPod Touches for taking orders. Like Au Bon Pain, the servers greet patrons at the door and send the orders behind the counter using a touch-based system.
“Some customers call it getting food at the Apple store,” says Clover General Manager Vincenzo Pileggi.
Clover has recently begun testing an electronic white board that will automatically update preparation time for each menu item.
“Don’t look too closely,” the note at the top of the electronic board warned on Saturday. “Hoping that someday it will soon be operational, but right now I’m just programming it. Those ‘min’ beside the menu items? That is the average serve time for the past 10 minutes for that item. Cool, huh?”
CUSTOMER INTERACTIVITY
The ability for customers to have hands-on control of their order is a growing trend among a few Harvard Square restaurants.
The server-customer relationship has changed through an on-table ordering device at Uno on 22 JFK St. Developed by a MIT triple-degree candidate dropout Rajat Suri. The pilot technology called E la Carte, which functions on a device named Presto, allows customers to view the full menu using a touch screen. Each menu item is displayed along with a photo and a price, and patrons can choose to customize their order by adding or removing ingredients when prompted.
“The idea behind it is not to replace someone, but to give guests the hands-on experience, to interact with the menu,” says Nick F. Novin, bar and lounge manager at Uno in Harvard Square.
The Presto device allows customers to play games while waiting for their food and keep track of the progress of their order.
Charlie’s Kitchen, an eatery on 10 Eliot St., is one of the first restaurants to use a program called TextMyFood, by which customers can communicate with servers via text message.
The system allows patrons to place orders and get the attention of their server by texting from their own cell phones when the server is out of sight, according to TextMyFood’s website.
THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT
At certain restaurants in Harvard Square, customers can place their orders through iPhone applications even before arriving.
The Chipotle chain created its application about a year and a half ago, using it to take orders in their restaurants throughout the country. Similarly, Zoe’s on 1105 Mass. Ave. recently created their own application, which was launched four months ago.
“I got the idea from my kids who said, ‘Dad, you just have to have an app,’” says Zoe’s owner Theophilos N. Vallas, although he admits that he personally uses a Blackberry and not an iPhone.
Vallas emphasizes that the system is more convenient for both customers and restaurant employees. It eliminates the step of having to answer the phone and take an order.
The application features Zoe’s full menu and gives customers every option as a server would, according to Vallas. But if the order is extensive, some words on the printed order could get cut off. Customers must pay with a credit or debit card in order to place an order successfully. They can also specify a pick-up time.
Similarly, Chipotle’s iPhone application menu allows patrons to customize their orders, but it also requires them to sign up for a Chipotle account. Clients also have the option of paying through the application or in the store.
A WORK IN PROGRESS
In spite of technological advances, the devices still leave room for improvement.
Novin says that the version of Presto that Uno first used was less dependable than subsequent generation devices currently in place. He says he would like to see a calorie counting feature and Internet-browsing capabilities added to the device in the future.
Vallas says that he hopes to add a delivery feature to Zoe’s iPhone application.
Advances in technology have also addressed security concerns, as some restaurants have developed a system allowing customers to have their credit cards swiped in front of them.
Legal Sea Foods on 20 University Road in Charles Square, uses a pay-at-table credit card swipe. A common feature in Europe, the system allows customers to swipe their credit cards at the table.
“The technology enhances the guest’s experience. Our owner recognized it as something we could use to separate ourselves from other restaurants and provide better quality service,” says Chris Incorvati, director of information technology at Legal Sea Foods.
According to Incorvati, Legal Sea Foods is one of the first American restaurants to use this system. It is now used in 24 Legal Sea Foods restaurants, and the company plans to expand it to all of their restaurants.
The battery-operated devices at Uno also allow for customers to split the bill, pay via credit card, and e-mail a receipt to themselves right at the table. Consequentially, tips have also increased, according to Novin, because the device offers options for 15, 18, 20, 22, and 25 percent tips as well as a customized percentage.
A group of customers from Miami who was visiting a friend who is a Harvard undergraduate were hoping to use the Presto device to order but were greeted by a server who took their orders instead.
“We just played the trivia games, and we ended up getting 20 percent off desserts,” said Becky M. Espinosa.
“We learned a lot. It makes you feel smart being next to Harvard,” said Jamie G. Bolduc.
Even though she did not use it to order, Bolduc said she appreciated how she was able to see the pictures of all the menu options.
During a busy lunch hour at Au Bon Pain, several customers noted that they enjoyed the speed and convenience of the new iPad systems.
Jamie Reed, a frequent Au Bon Pain customer, said that he preferred the old sandwich ordering system by paper.
“It was good enough for me,” Reed said.
Novin says that the Presto device sees about 10 to 15 percent customers decline to use the device, mostly their older customers.
But the technology is not intended to reduce the number of restaurant personnel, according to Suri.
“We’re not trying to replace any waiters,” he said. “The whole purpose is to increase sales.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston sports fans have grown accustomed to the New England Patriots going to the Super Bowl every year. It’s just supposed to happen. But after an early exit by the hometown football team, sports junkies will have to settle for another February Boston tradition: the Beanpot.
A staple of intercollegiate rivalry, the Beanpot features four Boston-area men’s hockey teams: Boston College, Harvard, Boston University, and Northeastern. Historically, Boston University has dominated, winning 29 times since the annual tournament began in 1952.
But last year’s champion, No. 1 Boston College, looks to be the heavy favorite again this year. In the midst of a dominant 2010-2011 campaign, the Eagles (19-6, 15-5 Hockey East) have already knocked off their toughest Beanpot opponent, No. 14 Boston University, three times this season, outscoring the Terriers, 17-9.
BC and BU (13-7-7, 10-5-5 Hockey East) will meet up again tonight at the TD Garden in the opening round of the tournament.
Only a few hours earlier, Harvard (4-17, 3-13 ECAC) will square off against Northeastern (8-11-6, 7-8-5 Hockey East) to kick of the 2011 men’s Beanpot. Coming in as the underdog, the Crimson faces an uphill battle. The boys from Cambridge have lost nine of their last 10, including a 3-0 defeat at the hands of the Huskies on Jan. 19.
But don’t count Harvard out just yet. After a 6-2 whooping of Colgate, the Crimson nearly beat a respectable Cornell team, falling only 2-1.
And this past Friday, Harvard traveled to New Haven to face No. 3 Yale. Though the Crimson eventually lost, 1-0, Harvard kept up with the Bulldogs, tallying just one fewer shot than Yale while keeping the home team scoreless until the third period.
If the Crimson is able to play like that tonight, a Northeastern victory shouldn’t come as easily as it did earlier this year.

After marking herself as one of the top skiers in the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association, Rebecca Nadler headed to Erzurum, Turkey to take on a slightly deeper field: the world.
On Saturday, Nadler placed 21st in the women's slalom event at the World University Games.
Given the 30th starting spot in the first run, Nadler posted a 24th place finish in the first run before using a strong second-run to bump herself up three places.
The Ottawa, Ont. native was the second Canadian finisher in the event behind Westminster College's Kendall Brown. Sterling Grant of the University  of Denver was the overall winner.
Nadler will rejoin Harvard for the Dartmouth Winter Carnival this coming weekend. While she was gone, alpine teammate Catherine Sheils led the Crimson charge. Sheils finished sixth in the slalom this past weekend at the University of  Vermont Winter Carnival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After narrowly losing to high-powered No. 3 Yale last week, Harvard men’s hockey team looked as though it had a good chance to upset unranked Northeastern in the first round of the 2011 Beanpot.
But nothing went the Crimson’s way, as the Huskies (9-11-6, 7-8-5 Hockey East) rolled to an easy 4-0 win over Harvard (4-18, 3-13 ECAC) in the tournament’s opener last night at TD Garden.
“[Northeastern] outplayed us in pretty much every facet of the game, from the net on out,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Give them a lot of credit.”
Harvard kept it close at the beginning. In the first frame, the Crimson looked strong, applying consistent pressure on the Northeastern backline.
“We had some chances in the first period,” Donato said. “There were definitely some rebounds that were up for grabs.”
But despite outshooting the Huskies 17-10 in the first frame, Harvard failed to find the back of the net, thanks in large part to the play Northeastern goaltender, Chris Rawlings. Last month’s top netminder in the Hockey East conference, the 6’5” sophomore shut down every Crimson opportunity.
Holding Harvard scoreless in the two ensuing frames, Rawlings tallied 41 saves in all, registering his fifth shutout of the season.
“He played well,” said co-captain and defenseman Chris Huxley. “There were a lot of rebounds, but ... he made the first save, and he found the second.”
“It looked like anything that [Rawlings] saw he was going to save,” Donato added. “[He] got stronger as the game went on.”
On the Crimson’s defensive end, senior goaltender Ryan Carroll just couldn’t match up to his Huskies counterpart.
After shutting down the Bulldogs’ offense last Friday, Carroll had a tough time controlling Northeastern, stopping just 83 percent of shots that came his way.
His struggles began during a first period counterattack, when Northeastern junior Mike McLaughlin received the puck at the red line. Charging down the ice, McLaughlin split freshmen defenders Dan Ford and Danny Fick before hitting the puck past Carroll to give the Huskies a 1-0 lead.
And it only got worse from there for the Harvard netminder.
Just 1:47 into the second frame, McLaughlin slapped a savable shot towards the Crimson goal. But Carroll failed to grab it, and the puck hit his stick before jumping over his head and into the net.
To Donato, Carroll’s miscue marked a turning point in the contest.
“After the second goal, when they got a bounce, we couldn’t mount much of an attack,” Donato said. “We played a semblance of our game in the first period.”
Though Harvard managed 11 shots on goal in the second frame, most came from beyond the faceoff circles and hardly fazed the Northeastern goaltender.
But the Crimson had plenty of action in their own defensive zone.
Just nine minutes after the first score of the period, Northeastern senior Wade MacLeod found fellow senior Steve Silva in the slot, who powered the puck past the Harvard goalie to take a three-goal lead.
To cap the scoring rampage, the Huskies capitalized on a 5-on-3 advantage. After two Crimson players received interference penalties, the Northeastern front line moved the puck with ease before freshman Brodie Reid scored the third and final goal of the period from the right faceoff circle.
In the final frame, Harvard replaced the struggling Carroll with senior Kyle Richter, who started between the pipes at the beginning of the season. Richter helped keep the Huskies scoreless in the third frame, but by that time the match was already out of reach.
With the defeat, Harvard has now dropped 17 of its last 19 contests.
Both the players and the coach were unsatisfied with the team’s performance.
“We didn’t play a full 60 minutes,” Huxley said. “It’s hard to win a hockey game when you don’t play hard.”
“I don’t feel like we came out with the same passion that we’ve been playing with,” Donato echoed.
In addition to what the team saw as a lack of determination, offensive struggles plagued the Crimson as well. But that’s nothing new for the men from Cambridge, having scored two or less goals in eight of their last nine games.
“We just didn’t create enough traffic and enough scoring opportunities in front of the goal,” Donato said.
After the discouraging loss, it won’t get any easier next week, when Harvard will face an even tougher opponent in No.14 Boston University in the consolation match.
To keep that game competitive, Harvard has a lot of work to do.
“We just [have to] get back to the tape and see what we did wrong, learn from our mistakes, and try not to make them again,” Huxley said.

Fans of the Harvard women’s basketball team held their breath Friday night as they witnessed Princeton pull ahead toward the end of the second half in a matchup between two Ivy League unbeatens.
With the Crimson trailing, 62-61, junior Brogan Berry got the ball at the top of the key and attacked the basket, opening up sophomore Victoria Lippert in the corner. Berry snapped the ball out, and Lippert drained the three with ease.
With the three, Harvard snatched the lead again, and went on to win, 73-67.
“That three was so crucial,” co-captain Jackie Alemany said. “But none of us were surprised she hit that shot.”
In fact, no one was surprised by Victoria Lippert’s game-changing shot.
“For her short career, she’s probably had the most ‘big’ shots of any of my teammates,” co-captain Christine Matera added.
But according to Lippert, the shot was more about her teammates than herself.
“I just have to give credit to my teammates for setting me up like that,” Lippert said.
Lippert finished with 14 points, including a number of key baskets down the stretch. Lippert shot 4-of-6 from the field and 3-of-4 from behind the arc. In addition to sinking crucial shots, Lippert was also eager to dive into the team’s dirty work, as she led her team in rebounding, pulling down seven boards.
Lippert helped Harvard continue its undefeated streak in Ivy play the following day, as the Crimson toppled Penn before a home crowd Saturday night. The weekend wins place Harvard alone atop the Ivy League.
Against Penn, Lippert again led her team on the boards, finishing with 11 on the night.
From the start of the second half, the lead changed hands multiple times. Twice Lippert hit crucial three-point shots to keep Harvard from slipping behind, giving the team what it needed to send the game to overtime.
The first bonus round ended with another tie, but the Crimson finally wrapped it up in the second overtime, coming away with an 88-84 win.
“I love playing in games like that—the ones that really come down to the wire,” Lippert said. “We have a tremendous will to win the Ivy League title this year.”
The six-foot guard was picked up by Harvard out of California’s Cathedral Catholic High School two years ago and has proven her versatility.
“We had her as a three last season and moved her to a four,” explained coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “I’m not surprised she had such a great weekend.”
Lippert has shot 57.9 percent from behind the arc thus far in Ivy League play, an impressive feat for someone who is as comfortable under the basket as her.
“[Her versatility] poses a problem for other teams,” Matera explained. “She’s great when she gets a post matchup because then she can pull [her defender] out and score from the outside.”
“She’s a matchup problem for a lot of teams,” Delaney-Smith echoed. “Victoria is at the top of my list in regards to work ethic and motivation.”
Lippert, a history of science concentrator who is a member of Athletes in Action, attributes her ultimate motivation from Jesus Christ.
“It doesn’t really matter what position I’m playing, just as long as I’m on the court, which is really a blessing anyways."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chance to play for the Harvard men’s tennis team and to take home an Ivy League title seems like a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luckily, senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans is receiving a second chance to live out one of his dreams.
Going into his senior year, it seemed things were only looking up for Chijoff-Evans. He had amassed a 19-12 singles record, which tied him for the most singles wins on the team; he had consistently played at the No. 1 singles slot, and he was going to be captain the squad. Then he made the announcement in September, after months of thinking over the decision, that he would be leaving the team.
For anyone who follows the Crimson tennis squad, it was a shocking decision. But it was not one that Chijoff-Evans had made lightly. It was the first time in his life that he was taking an extended break from playing tennis, but ultimately, he did so to benefit the team.
“I had played tennis for so long ... I did have a lot on my plate and I really sat down and thought about it for a long time,” Chijoff-Evans said. “Tennis, for the first time in my life, was not one of my personal top priorities, so I knew that being on the team in this particular mindset would have been detrimental to myself and detrimental to the team.”
But even more surprising than his announcement to leave the tennis team was his decision to return in the middle of the fall semester. Like professional players who have retired and come back to the sport, such as Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin, Chijoff-Evans just couldn’t stay away from the game he had grown up playing. He just needed the time to step away from the court and clear his mind.
“In years prior, I was completely committed and wanted nothing but an Ivy League Championship,” Chijoff-Evans said. “[Now], I’m fully committed [again] and I’m really happy that I took this break. It’s kind of like a new beginning—a new start—for me on the team.”
When athletes look back at their careers, sometimes there’s one thing that fuels their comeback or one accolade that is missing from their careers. For Andre Agassi, it was the career grand slam. For Justine Henin, it was Wimbledon. For Chijoff-Evans, it’s another Ivy League Championship.
“I really want to get another Ivy League title,” Chijoff-Evans said. “We’ve had great teams my sophomore and junior years, but we’ve just fallen ever so slightly short of getting an Ivy League Championship.”
But, as Chijoff-Evans has found out, the passion and drive alone doesn’t mean the road will be easy. Chijoff-Evans started practicing with the team again in November, but had to wait until January to test if he was match-tough due to a break in the Crimson’s schedule.
In the five matches he has played, Chijoff-Evans has gone 2-3. He started out with a rough 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to his Northwestern opponent, but won his latest match, 2-6, 6-3, 10-8. A significant challenge for the senior has been regaining his aggression on the court, but the longer he plays, especially in three-set marathon matches, the closer Chijoff-Evans should get to his peak level.
“My junior spring, I didn’t have to think much on the court,” Chijoff-Evans said. “Things just happened because I was so well-grooved, but now I’m not in this comfort zone…. I’m thinking a lot about what to do and how to hit the ball…. I think it’s just a matter of playing time. The more playing time I get, the better I’ll become.”
Luckily for Chijoff-Evans, he has a team around him that has welcomed him back onto the squad and supported his return. The bonds he had formed with his teammates were the reason he mentioned for returning to the sport.
“It’s great to have him back after a long layoff, and it’s good to see him … competing,” captain Aba Omodele-Lucien said. “We hope he has a good recovery from his break and we still expect great things from our teammate.”
Chijoff-Evans hopes the experience he has gained throughout his time at Harvard, accompanied by the support from his teammates, can propel the senior toward the goal of winning another Ivy League Championship.
In his second opportunity, Chijoff-Evans is looking to end his Crimson tennis career on the right note.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the No. 1 Trinity men’s squash team lost, Bill Clinton was still president, Titanic had just come out, and Google wouldn’t be founded for another seven months.
Since that Feb. 22, 1998 loss to Harvard, the Bantams (14-0, 7-0 NESCAC) have won an unprecedented 238 consecutive matches—the longest streak of any kind in NCAA Division I history—and 12 consecutive national championships.
If college athletic history means anything, the Crimson might have the best shot of taking down the powerhouse from Connecticut. After losing to Stanford on April 6, 2008, UConn women’s basketball won 90 straight before falling to the Cardinal at the end of last year. Likewise, Notre Dame victories over John Wooden’s UCLA provided the bookends to the Bruins’ famous run in the early 1970’s.
The No. 6 Harvard men’s squash team (7-3, 3-2 Ivy) will try to emulate the Cardinal and the Fighting Irish tomorrow night, when the Crimson and Trinity face off at the Barnaby Courts.
But Harvard has a tall task ahead. The Crimson fell 7-2 to No. 3 Princeton, a much weaker opponent than the Bantams. After all, Trinity thrashed the Tigers 9-0 last year.
To keep up with the national champs, Harvard will need big performances out of everyone, but especially from its freshmen, who make up three of the top four spots.
Things look brighter for the No. 1 Crimson women (8-0, 5-0 Ivy), who also face No. 3 Bantams (12-0, 5-0 NESCAC) tomorrow night at the Barnaby Courts. Led by sophomore Laura Gemmell, last year’s individual national champion, Harvard hasn’t dropped a match in the last two seasons.
Like in its 2009-2010 campaign, the Crimson has held its own against tough teams, beating No. 4 Penn, 5-4, on Saturday and No. 5 Princeton, 7-2, the following day. But the Trinity team the women face tomorrow night will be the best they’ve seen all season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the outcome of the Crimson women’s tennis team’s match against BC hanging in the balance—Harvard narrowly ahead, 3-2—the day’s two remaining singles matches were forced to three sets.
The Crimson (2-2) had started slowly Saturday at the Murr Center, losing its doubles point for the fourth straight time in the nascent season.
But junior Samantha Gridley managed to garner the momentum she needed to lift her squad to a win.
Playing at No. 6, the junior rebounded from a tough first set to topple Eagle sophomore Ina Kauppila, 2-6, 6-0, 6-4.
Soon after, No. 45 junior co-captain Holly Cao added an insurance point with her 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 win over sophomore Alex Kelleher to finish off BC (2-2, 1-0 ACC) by a final score of 5-2.
“Our team performed really well,” Cao said. “We lost the doubles point, and that was a disappointment because we’ve been working on our doubles. [But] we did a really good job coming back after the doubles point. As a team we did really well in the singles matches. We were all really proud that we came away with the win.”
Harvard coach Traci Green was likewise pleased with the match’s result.
“BC is a very talented team,” Green said. “We weren’t taking them lightly. Every match we were focusing the best we could, and the match went our way.”
Indeed, the Eagles demonstrated their skill right from the start. At No. 1, Kelleher and sophomore Olga Khmylev made quick work of Cao and fellow co-captain Samantha Rosekrans, nabbing an 8-2 victory.
“Sam and I didn’t play our best in doubles,” Cao said. “We had a slow start.”
Sophomore Hideko Tachibana and freshman Natalie Blosser captured a sound 8-1 victory for the Crimson at No. 2, but the crew ultimately lost the doubles point, when sophomore Kristen Norton and freshman Hannah Morrill fell, 8-5, at court three.
But the discouraging start only inspired the Harvard crew to push harder in the singles matches.
“We mustered up all of our energy to pull through,” Green said.
Cao was undoubtedly a prime example of putting it all on the line. Even after her teammate Gridley had clinched the match, the Australia native endured deuce after deuce to eventually come away with a dominant third-set comeback.
“I thought she played pretty well,” Cao said of her singles opponent. “She played a smart match.”
Cao also noted an important factor that would not make it into the game statistics—the fans.
“BC had a lot of supporters, because many of the players are from Massachusetts,” she explained. “[For example,] my opponent had her parents and lots of relatives there to support her.”
“I think the entire team did a really good job of supporting each other, and that was what made the difference for us in the end,” Cao said.
With her squad firmly behind her, Norton bounced back from her doubles loss to senior Katharine Attwell and junior Katarina Gajic. She faced down Attwell at No. 3 and was one of the first off the courts after a dominant 6-0, 6-2 win.
Sophomore Hideko Tachibana secured her second win of the day soon after at No. 2, dropping only four games to rookie Eagle Veronica Corning in her 6-0, 6-4 win.
Blosser likewise nabbed two victories, defeating Gajic at No. 4, 6-2, 6-3.
The only singles loss for the Crimson came at No. 5.
After a tough doubles match, Rosekrans fell to Khmylev for a second time in two quick sets, 6-2, 6-2.
Despite the losses, Green said that she viewed the match as an opportunity for her players to gain individual match experience. She also pointed out the importance of developing a strong mental game.
“The main thing that our team is benefitting from is that we’re getting more and more mentally tough,” Green said. “Mental toughness will be very important...[especially] in Ivy League play.”
As the young season progresses, then, the ladies of the Harvard tennis team will look to apply this toughness to their doubles matches in particular.
“Our number one for us is our doubles,” Cao said. “When Ivy season rolls around, we’ll really need our doubles point.”

Cambridge has seen an unusually high amount of snowfall this winter, and  recent weather conditions have caused enough damage to the Quincy House  library, also known as the Qube, to force it to close.
According  to Quincy House Building Manager Dick Nerden, the Qube has been closed  since the beginning of the semester due to a combination of age and  extreme weather conditions that resulted in frozen drains and ceiling  leaks. Nerden and his staff have been working to complete the necessary repairs. So far, two separate drains have been fixed, and roof leaks  are in the process of being repaired.
"We hope it'll be open by the end of this week or the start of the next," Nerden said.
In the meantime, Qube enthusiasts are forced to find other nooks to call their study spots. Lucky for them, they can use this handy guide to figure out the next best place to do their reading.

While an average café displays an array of pastel-and-seashore artwork on its walls, the Barker Center Rotunda instead boasts a smattering of witty and eco-friendly cartoons.
These are not your Sunday funnies, but cartoons with a purpose—to spread the word about environmental issues across campus. These CERtoons (Campus Emission Reduction toons) are last year’s winners of an annual competition hosted by the Harvard University Office for Sustainability.
This year’s CERtoon competition is accepting cartoons on any eco-related theme through Wednesday, Feb. 16. Student representatives and staff of the Office for Sustainability will filter through applicants and choose the top fifteen winners. Students themselves will make the final cut, choosing their favorite three in early March during CERtoon study breaks in Annenberg and in upperclassman Houses.
Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program Coordinator Brandon P. Geller '08 has been overseeing the CERtoon competition for the past two years and expressed excitement to see the effects of this year’s competition.
"Cartoons are quick and can convey a lot of information in just an instant," Geller said. "The message will stay with you for the rest of the day."
The 15 first round winners will receive $25 gift certificates, while the lucky top three collect prizes including $100 and $150 American Express gift cards and an Ipod Touch. All winners will also have their work displayed in various venues across Harvard ranging from the Greenhouse Café to the Mather House Big TV Room.
Secret cartoonist at heart? Prove it. Thinking green thoughts, but lack artistic skill? Grab a friend (or coerce a VES concentrator) and enter as a team!
So get your sketches going, and visit the website to fill out the submission form and send your CERtoon in.
