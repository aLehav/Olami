After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s almost senseless to talk about the second episode of the third season of “Broad City” without focusing on its best moment: Ilana’s reaction when Lincoln finally musters the courage to confess to her that he slept with someone else. Ilana makes a scene, as she typically does, by kicking over a bike, yelling in public, throwing a plant. And the viewer’s faith in Ilana and in “Broad City” is shaken. Is Ilana a hypocrite, the sexist person’s parody of a feminist? Can she honestly be upset with Lincoln, given that she has slept with so many one-episode characters?
Of course not. Ilana humps a tree; then, atop the hood of Lincoln’s car, she screams, “That is so fucking hot!” She explains to Lincoln, “We are a modern day Will and Jada. We are open sex friends. We are poly. We are bi,” to which Lincoln objects, “I’m not bi!” Ilana remains as extraordinary and likable as ever, and order is restored to the universe.
Few shows other than “Broad City” have accrued enough confidence from their viewers to execute a scene like this. Negative depictions of feminists are common enough in culture as to be expected, but “Broad City” is so opposed to this stereotype that it can parody the stereotype itself. In a single scene, “Broad City” illustrates the pervasive forces which it opposes and demolishes them—a potent illustration of just how easy it is to create spectacular humor from a progressive perspective. More potently than any thinkpiece could, this scene questions the fundamental premise of “Family Guy”-style humor. Why play into stereotypes when subverting them is so much funnier?
Even beyond this scene, the episode is uniquely self-conscious. It devotes much of its length to Abbi trying to impersonate Ilana in order to cover her co-op work hours, and the mimicry is wonderfully ridiculous. Abbi first walks into the co-op proclaiming, “Rape culture sucks!” and informs a fellow worker that “We are on the fast track to, like, caramel and queerdom. Later, she tries to twerk against a wall while doing a handstand and knocks down a display of dried beans in spectacular fashion. Granted, the switched identities conceit might have been elevated by an increased focus on Ilana’s portrayal of Abbi, as this episode does read as Ilana-centric rather than Ilana and Abbi-centric, which is a shame. Though she certainly has less flamboyant a persona than Ilana, Abbi has the capacity to be just as hilarious; hopefully this potential will more fully manifest as the season progresses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Housing Day approaches and we celebrate “randomization” as a mechanism to diversify the House system, Harvard still struggles to make House staff more diverse. According to House lore, in the early 1990’s there was a top ranked law student, and later president of the Harvard Law Review, who applied to be a tutor in each Harvard College House. Without so much of an interview, every House outright rejected him—save one that rejected him after his interview. This law student went on to become the 44th President of the United States. (Whether this story is true is not as important as its plausibility to those familiar with the House system’s historical hiring practices.)
Over 200 years after its founding, the United States elected Barack H. Obama the first African American President—a shamefully long overdue milestone. Yet, the United States was still ahead of Harvard, over a hundred years older, which failed to appoint African American House Masters until 2009. The belated appointment of Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie Robinson as House Masters (now known as Faculty Deans) of Winthrop House highlights that, prior to 2009, Harvard either did not consider it a moral imperative to diversify its House leadership or no one took notice and really cared. How ironic that the United States had an African American president before Harvard had an African American House Master.
Certainly Harvard made incremental progress to diversify the House system before Ron and Stephanie’s arrival, but true change through Winthrop House is what has occurred since their appointment as they tirelessly usher in a movement for more diversity and inclusion at Harvard in all respects, including, but not limited to, the Winthrop tutor and House staff, currently comprised of a diverse and motley group of people advising, teaching, and mentoring those affectionately called Winthropians by some and reigning Straus Cup champions by others.
Their progress is clear by looking at the photos adorning the Senior Common Room walls of the tutors and staff dating back to the 1950’s as optic proof of Winthrop’s dramatic evolution since 2009. The photos of House staff in the years immediately before Ron and Stephanie's appointment are noticeably lacking in the rich diversity that defines Winthrop House today. Indeed, even looking at the ‘08-‘09 group photo of Winthrop House tutors and staff, one sees an anachronous image—a predominantly white male crowd, a few women, and the sole African American Building Manager giving the optical illusion of some diversity, but strikingly monochromatic… until after 2009 when the photos begin to explode with color.
However, creating more diversity in Winthrop within a school historically silent about the discriminatory history of the House system is easier said than done.  Change is an uneasy pill to swallow. This is not to ignore Harvard’s commitment to diversify its student body, but exposes a key area where the College was sorely lacking prior to 2009 even after diversifying its student body. The subtle, yet clearly subordinating, message Harvard sent to its historically marginalized students was: “You can attend school here, but your access pretty much stops there.”
The intrinsic effect in diversifying the makeup of the tutor and House staff is immeasurable. A student’s House experience quite often defines their Harvard experience. Winthrop’s reputation of zealous House spirit and the increase of diversity within its staff are not coincidental. Tutors and staff are able to connect with a broader range of students based on shared backgrounds, providing a much-needed piece in the mosaic of college resources. A diverse tutor staff creates a more welcoming and safe space for students to divulge personal struggles, feel less afraid to seek out academic advice and guidance without the stigma of being considered unqualified, less apprehensive to seek out mental health treatment, and enhances the daily dining hall conversations where much of the Harvard education occurs.
With varied human resources within the House, students are less likely to fall through the proverbial cracks. The continued protests over lack of inclusion, pervasive microaggressions, and the frustrations of students of color that boiled over on campuses such as Yale and Mizzou, and at Harvard Law School, should remind us that a diverse student body is not enough. For Harvard to realize its diversity mission, it should follow Winthrop’s lead and be as aggressive about recruiting diverse staff in each House as it is in attracting a diverse undergraduate class each year.
Hopefully, Harvard will reproduce Ron and Stephanie’s success in creating a House where the staff resembles the diversity of students they serve. Their remake of Winthrop in a few short years has changed the face of Winthrop and its legacy—and the evidence of their work is crystal clear. Harvard has realized the consequential benefits of appointing Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie Robinson as Faculty Deans of Winthrop House.
Good begets good, diversity begets diversity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, someone tore down a hard plastic sign indicating an all-gender single-stall bathroom in Eliot House to partially reveal the word “men” painted beneath the splintered sign. The Faculty Deans of the House sent out an email stating that they couldn’t possibly know the intentions or motivations of the person who tore down the sign—who had torn down the sign three or four times before.
But I am willing to make assumptions.
There is a white serpent—a scaly, reptilian thing—becoming somewhat of a threat, fiery and hissing on the horizon. He is not a funny man. He is not a joke, and neither are his slithering legions, rising again in his fervent support. I will not speak his name into being here.
These are not the things I like to write about. This part is a secret: I have this dream all the time where I’m stuck in a place—a neighborhood, a decaying city, a home. Everyone in the place who is supposed to be there is armed. I am not supposed to be there.
I’m willing to make an assumption about the intentions of the person in Eliot who tore down the all-gender bathroom sign, because this is a trend. Not just a trend in angry boys tearing down signs because the signs are not for them, but also angry boys building walls to keep out people who don’t look like them, angry boys winning state after state primary, angry boys with guns in my dreams and on my newsfeed.
But for the sake of argument, lets say it’s just about the signs.
Earlier this year, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day—Columbus Day, as the university still insists on calling it—someone in Pfoho put up objective, factual signs about the atrocities that Christopher Columbus committed in the name of his genocide. There were no op-eds about it, but I walked past a dozen of those flyers torn up, crumpled, on the floor. What is it about simple facts on an angry white boy and the pile of bodies behind him that evokes the furious urge to put those facts away? What is it that drives a student to rage—physical, destructive rage—about a toilet? Or an art collective?
It is all the same message: You should be grateful to be here in the first place. We will have you how we want you. We will have you quiet, out of sight. And you shouldn’t ask for more.
This inclusive piece of plastic, making it possible for students to do something as revolutionary as use the bathroom in their own home? This poster for an all-poc art collective, putting words to the experience of being on this campus and not being white? This movement, taking space that should have already been given to us, demanding marginally more than the bare minimum, making so much noise? This is not how we wanted you.
When a place was made for one kind of person, a thousand working groups, subcommittees, and reports aren’t going to make it into a home for everyone else. There will still be the angry boys, tearing down things that are not theirs precisely because they are not theirs. There is, I guess, something scary about hardwood floor slipping out from under you. About giant white portraits falling from the walls. About unapologetic bodies in an unwelcoming space. About losing control.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, Harvard’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault released its final report, the core of which was six recommendations for how the University can reduce its incidence of sexual assault. To a great extent, the roots of the problem are the internalized culture and norms with which students arrive in Cambridge.  Harvard cannot credibly attempt to change that in four short years, but smart policies like those outlined in the report can reduce the prevalence of assault. Though we disagree with some of the report’s suggestions and assumptions, we strongly support most of its recommendations.
While the report is correct about the correlation between the consumption of alcohol and assault, a ban on or large penalties for hard alcohol misses the mark. This policy was implemented at Dartmouth last year and has not been very successful; a recent survey of Dartmouth students found that 85 percent of respondents had consumed hard alcohol on campus, and 80 percent viewed the policy as ineffective at lowering high-risk drinking. Given the more direct options available for addressing campus sexual assault and the costs of trying to police students, this recommendation represents far too little benefit at far too much cost.
We see the report’s suggestions on posting security guards outside of entrances to upperclass Houses more favorably, but believe that more clarity is certainly needed. Ideally, entry points would be kept the same and more guards hired, though we recognize that operational constraints might make that impossible.
Importantly, we worry that the report did not deal substantially enough with the consequences for the perpetrators of sexual assaults, perhaps largely by dint of the Task Force’s more limited mandate. While we understand the administrative desire to limit the Task Force’s work to a well-defined bailiwick, this omission is disappointing because it forgets that consequences work as a deterrent and are thus crucial to effective prevention.
These criticisms should not detract from the more numerous areas in which the Task Force’s recommendations were well considered and deserving of implementation. For instance, its view of final clubs was a strong statement on the deeply troubling nature of exclusive social spaces with gendered power dynamics. We continue to believe that these groups pose significant challenges in the context of sexual assault and beyond. The results of last semester’s sexual assault survey suggest that final clubs are the site of a disproportionate number of assaults, and yesterday’s report reveals that female seniors "participating in the final clubs" are approximately 50 percent more likely to report sexual assault. In light of these startling and heartbreaking statistics, the Task Force is right to urge that the administration continue to pressure the male clubs to become co-ed.
Of course, simply addressing the problems with final clubs will not solve the the broader sexual assault problem, nor will it provide students with more inclusive social spaces. Here, the report’s request that the College streamline the party approval process in the Houses and enable more events like last semester’s [BLANK] Party are particularly well-targeted. These proposals could have a significant effect on the College’s social life by moving parties to venues that are safer and less susceptible to the gendered power dynamics present in final clubs.
Perhaps the most important recommendations are those on education and training for students. As the report argues, if sexual violence is fundamentally a societal problem, education must be a central focus of prevention. The suggestions that students receive yearly, substantive sexual assault training in small groups, and that such training be better integrated into residential life, deserve swift and full implementation.
A final but important area addressed by the report is the relatively high prevalence of sexual assault among Harvard’s BGLTQ community. Increasing resources for BGLTQ survivors, ensuring that the community receives adequate support, and deepening understanding of this worrying trend are all critical.
Ultimately, this report presents the Harvard community with an opportunity to deal substantively with a key issue facing our campus. Simply put, our attitude towards sexual assault must change. Not all of these changes will be successful, and as the report suggests they should be subject to rigorous research and evaluation. The new administrator recommended by the report could play a key role in ensuring that policies that work are widely implemented. But all of us have a role in ensuring that Harvard confronts the problem of sexual assault with care and intelligence. Together, we can indeed do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A semester after a survey revealed the alarming prevalence of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus, a task force has recommended that students receive annual sexual assault prevention training and that the University hire a new administrator to spearhead prevention efforts.
In a wide-ranging report released Tuesday, the task force also asked the University to expand sexual assault support for BGLTQ students across Harvard’s schools and more closely scrutinize the “deeply misogynistic attitudes” of the College’s historically male final clubs.
Last semester, an unprecedented University-wide survey pulled back a curtain on the prevalence of sexual assault at Harvard, prompting students, professors, and administrators to call on the University to do more. After months of deliberation, the same task force that organized the survey has released a final and comprehensive set of programmatic recommendations to confront “the profoundly and upsetting harmful problem.”
In an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday afternoon, University President Drew G. Faust accepted the task force’s recommendations, many of which will go into effect by the start of the next academic year.
“I recognize, as does the task force, that the recommendations are not and cannot be the last word in Harvard’s efforts to combat sexual assault,” Faust wrote. “Our practices and policies will need to evolve as we learn from the experience here and elsewhere. In that spirit, the position recommended by the task force will serve a vital role.” 
In its report, the task force—composed of professors, administrators and students from around the University whom Faust appointed to study sexual assault prevention on campus—offers a wide-ranging and frequently critical assessment of the “deeply troubling” realities of sexual assault across Harvard’s 12 schools, with a particular focus on the resources and social scene of the College.
The report calls on the College to develop “a plan to address the problems presented by Final Clubs,” sponsor more social events for students, increase grants provided by Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, and limit the number of entry points to dorms and Houses so that a security officer may screen students as they enter and exit.
The report is the culmination of almost two years of work that that began when Faust asked Steven E. Hyman, former University provost and biology professor, to chair the task force. To date, that task force has released two interim reports and helped conduct a sexual climate survey that found that 31 percent of undergraduate senior female respondents at the College had experienced some kind of sexual assault during their four years at Harvard.
Now, in its final report, the task force has offered a set of concrete recommendations for cultural and structural change in both the short and long-term.
“There is no single or simple solution to such a widespread, deeply entrenched problem,” the report states. “Progress will take time and will require the continued and consistent commitment of leadership at both the University and School levels.”
A COLLEGE FOCUS
Citing the College’s residential nature, unique social scene, and younger students, the task force focuses many of its recommendations on Harvard’s undergraduate population and the College—the only one of Harvard’s schools specifically mentioned.
The task force frequently, and candidly, criticizes the “domination of the social scene by Final Clubs, with a lack of social spaces that students perceive as more inclusive” and points to creating more accessible social spaces as a partial remedy. Specifically, the report calls for more College-sponsored social engagements for undergraduates and suggests that Harvard continue to emphasize and support House social life as well as consider “temporary alternatives and pop-up spaces” in the short-term.
“Space — who controls it, what is allowed within it, who finds it attractive — shapes the possibilities for social interaction,” the report reads. The report cites October’s [BLANK] Party and the Annenberg Halloween Party as models for events that create a “shared campus culture.”
But while advocating for more undergraduate social space, the report also proposes that programs to expedite and fund gatherings be conditioned on completion of sexual assault prevention and alcohol awareness training. The currently-optional training on hosting safe parties should be mandatory, the report recommends, and funding for events should be contingent on completion of such programming, with the possibility of bonuses for more in-depth training.
The task force also devoted a section of the report to combating underage alcohol use at the College, writing that “there is no question” that alcohol increases the risk of sexual assault. The report asks that dorms and Houses decrease the number of entry points so students would have to pass a security officer “who would be trained to detect students in need of help.” It also calls for the College to update its online “Harvard Proof” programming for freshmen and to collaborate with local bars and businesses to “reduce the likelihood that students under 21 are served.”
The report suggests examining policies that would discourage the consumption of hard liquor. “Penalties worth studying need not be draconian — the goal is to bias drinking away from its most dangerous forms,” the report states.
The task force endorsed a number of alcohol-related interventions that have already been implemented at the College, including moving Freshman Formal back on campus, increasing the availability of food and non-alcoholic beverages at parties, and prohibiting third-party vendors from selling hard alcohol at large events like Harvard-Yale.
The report also contains a lengthy indictment of final clubs, addressing the “disturbing practical and cultural implications they present in undergraduate life” and asking the College to develop a concrete plan for addressing those issues. The report expresses strong support for final clubs to expand membership to all genders. Referencing Harvard-specific survey data, the report expresses concern that students participating in final club activities report higher rates of sexual assault than others.
A Harvard-specific supplement to the original sexual climate survey found that 47 percent of female College senior respondents who had participated in final clubs—which includes both interactions as a guests at male final clubs and as members of the female clubs—had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college, compared to 31 percent of female senior respondents on the whole.
The main report also includes a critical note on Greek life at Harvard, which now includes four sororities and five fraternities. Forty percent of female College senior respondents involved in Greek organizations reported nonconsensual sexual contact, a higher-than-average statistic. The task force invited more scrutiny into fraternities and sororities.
A UNIVERSITY-WIDE REPORT
Nearly six months after a sexual climate survey revealed what Faust called a “deeply disturbing” prevalence of sexual assault on campus, the task force report diagnoses some enabling factors of sexual assault—including what it characterizes as the ubiquity of hard alcohol and insufficiency of preventative training—and offers a number of potential remedies.
The report emphasizes sexual assault training that Harvard students receive as an immediate area of improvement. Most mandatory education about sexual assault and alcohol use only occur during first-year student orientation; now, the report recommends, education about sexual assault should occur annually and take place in small groups to improve quality.
“We believe that a single session devoted to sexual misconduct, especially delivered as a component of general orientation, is not sufficient to help students internalize the University’s expectations of them as members of this academic community,” the report reads.
In addition to more robust training and education efforts, the report recommends that the Provost’s office hire a permanent new staff member “responsible for ensuring that the University and the Schools regularly evaluate and improve their prevention efforts.” While several administrators focus on sexual assault prevention and training, the report identifies the importance of an additional central administrator to develop a long-term approach and coordinate efforts between the Title IX office, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and other offices.
“It is hard to imagine how such a long-term focus can occur without having a dedicated person responsible for ensuring that the University remains focused on the inevitably evolving requirements of an effective prevention program at a complex institution,” the report reads.
The task force asked that the new administrator assemble a working group to coordinate University-wide prevention efforts, plan future surveys about sexual assault at Harvard, and oversee annual reports from each of Harvard’s schools about prevention.
The report emphasizes the importance of awareness and understanding of Harvard’s sexual assault and sexual harassment policies and resources. Last semester’s survey revealed that a minority of students at Harvard knew about or trusted how the University handles complaints of sexual assault. The task force proposes several new initiatives to bolster awareness and trust, such as an anonymous form through which students can ask questions about sexual assault resources.
“Based upon the AAU Survey and the Task Force’s outreach findings, it is clear that we have fallen short in making students aware of how sexual misconduct is defined, where to get help when sexual assault or other misconduct occurs, where and how to report incidents, and what is likely to happen after an incident is reported,” the report reads.
Building on the survey results, which found higher incidences of sexual assault among students identifying as LGBAQN—lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, questioning, or not listed—the task force acknowledged it needs to learn more about the specific needs of BGLTQ students. It suggests that each of Harvard’s graduate and professional schools begin to offer resources to BGLTQ students similar to those in place at the College.
Though the report provides a slew of recommendations to more effectively prevent sexual assault at Harvard broadly, it leaves the implementation of those recommendations to the schools themselves.
YEARS IN THE MAKING
While the report represents Harvard’s most exhaustive effort to confront sexual assault on campus, it was not the task force’s first action, nor will it be Harvard’s last.
Faust created the task force in 2014 as the federal government opened an investigation into the College’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. The task force, split into three subcommittees—one dedicated to outreach, another to the survey, and one to research—quickly began its work.
In its first set of recommendations from May 2014, the task force doubled OSAPR’s budget and proposed conducting the sexual conduct climate survey that has now informed the final report. It also released a second set of interim recommendations, which, among other proposals, called for more funding for late night transportation for students.
Initially set for a January 2016 release date, Faust emailed out the final report Tuesday afternoon after almost two additional months of deliberation.
The report states that Harvard should continue to conduct surveys to gather data and evaluate the effectiveness of  its sexual assault programs and effort.
“Surveys should be conducted at regular intervals to measure and inform ourselves about how well the University and the Schools are accomplishing our goals,” the report reads.
While this will be the task force’s final action, the report emphasized that more work remains to be done.
“We anticipate that the recommendations in this, our final report, will make a difference in the culture, climate, and experience of students at Harvard,” the report finishes. “But, as we have emphasized, they are first steps in a process that will require sustained attention, a commitment to experimentation and innovation, and tolerance for trying new approaches, some of which will undoubtedly prove unsuccessful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, the Fox Club’s undergraduate leaders, fearing looming administrative sanctions if they remained all-male, admitted women to the club. In a letter defending their decision to the Fox’s skeptical graduate board, undergraduate officers wrote that failure to go co-ed would open the Fox to criticism in a forthcoming report outlining Harvard’s plans to address “sexual assault and gender equity on campus.”
Worse, Fox and A.D. Club leaders independently argued, College administrators could consider prohibiting undergraduate membership in the clubs.
The undergraduates’ suspicions, it seems, were well-founded. In a scathing report released Tuesday, the University’s Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention blasts historically male final clubs for “deeply misogynistic attitudes,” and calls on the College to formulate “a plan to address the problems presented by Final Clubs,” in what is one of the strongest University-sponsored condemnations of the clubs to date.
The 20 pages of the University-wide report include more than three pages of “Further Observations on Final Clubs” devoted exclusively to qualitative and quantitative analysis of the clubs’ role on campus. In subsidiary research, the task force’s Outreach and Communications subcommittee freely criticizes the clubs and offers recommendations for College administrators in blunt terms.
“Either don't allow simultaneous membership in Final Clubs and College enrollment; or allow Clubs to transition to all-gender inclusion with equal gender membership and leadership,” the group recommended to the entire task force.
The final report sharply condemns the clubs, emphasizing one data point in particular: 47 percent. This is the percentage of female College seniors “participating in the Final Clubs”—including women who attend male final club events and seniors who are members of female final clubs—who reported “experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college,” representing the highest figure among any student groups included in data from a University-wide sexual climate survey conducted last spring.
The corresponding survey statistic for all total female College seniors at Harvard was 31 percent, “suggest[ing] that a Harvard College woman is half again more likely to experience sexual assault if she is involved with a Club than the average female Harvard College Senior,” according to the report.
The final report, in no uncertain terms, castigates the male final clubs, which have for more than three decades effectively enjoyed independence from College oversight. The report describes final clubs as emblematic of “sexual entitlement,” troubling areas of potential alcohol abuse and sexual assault, and “vestige[s] of gender inequity” on campus.
Though the report says Harvard’s sexual assault problem is not “solely or even principally a byproduct of the activities and influence of Final Clubs,” it states that combatting sexual assault at Harvard “must include” proposals to address the clubs.
The report lists “address[ing] the distinctive problems presented by the Final Clubs and other unrecognized single-sex social organizations,” as one of six “Key Recommendations” for action.
“In our view, the very structure of the Clubs — men in positions of power engaging with women on unequal and too often on very sexual terms — speaks tellingly to the work ahead of us if we are to create an environment where all students, of all genders, can thrive,” the report states.
“The qualitative and quantitative information before us is deeply troubling and requires a strong response from Harvard,” the report adds.
This unprecedented condemnation of sexual assault statistics, membership practices, and alleged aura of exclusivity associated with Harvard’s all-male final clubs is the latest in a series of escalating calls from administrators for the centuries-old institutions to change their ways. This time, though, the report calls for more than just rhetoric. The task force asks University President Drew G. Faust to mandate a targeted plan from the College to combat issues related to final clubs.
“The clear and powerful call for the University to address issues presented by final clubs relates not only to sexual assault but also to the implications of gender discrimination, gender assumptions, privilege, and exclusivity on our campus,” Faust wrote Tuesday in an email Harvard affiliates.
MOUNTING SCRUTINY
Since beginning his tenure in the fall of 2014, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has focused significant attention on social life broadly and final clubs in particular.
After the then-all male Spee Club circulated a controversial party invitation last spring, Khurana wrote an email to undergraduates emphatically criticizing the invitation as “offensive, crude, and sexist.”
Last fall, Faust, in her most extensive comments on final clubs, said she worried about alcohol abuse and sexual assault on final club properties. In tandem with increasingly bold public pronouncements from administrators, including Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, administrators suggested in private meetings with undergraduate and graduate final club leaders that the clubs go co-ed.
Amid the increased scrutiny, the Spee club invited women to “punch,” or apply for membership, in early September. About a month later, Fox undergraduates added a pre-selected group of women to their ranks, and wrote in a letter to Fox graduates that administrators had “forced [their] hand.” 
“If the Fox Club does not become a coed club, it will be categorized with all the other clubs when Harvard releases qualitative sexual assault information,” undergraduates officers wrote to graduates in October.
Racked by internal divisions after the undergraduates’ unilateral move, the Fox has not yet granted full membership to their female affiliates, who now hold only “provisional” status pending a special graduate vote.
At least one other club—the A.D.—firmly opposed membership changes in the wake of administrative pressure, and received legal advice on measures the group could take should Harvard mandate the group go co-ed.
While Khurana has remained tight-lipped on his involvement in the Spee and the Fox’s decisions to go co-ed, Fox Club correspondence obtained by The Crimson suggests that undergraduates believed administrators had imposed a November deadline for the club to admit women.
Khurana’s policy toward final clubs marks a sharp departure from previous policies that date back to 1984, when the clubs disaffiliated with the University after rejecting an ultimatum to go co-ed. Since then, the clubs have been left alone for the most part, though College administrators did engage with them in a limited capacity.
‘UNSAFE CULTURE’
The task force’s report leaves no doubt that final clubs are now an administrative priority.
The Outreach and Communications subcommittee’s report says that final clubs “perpetuate gender inequity and an unhealthy social climate, including sexual harassment and assault, making this status quo unacceptable.”
Criticizing male final club practices ranging from the selection process to parties, the final report is wide-ranging in its condemnation of the all-male organizations. Off campus and out of administrative reach, the clubs “present special opportunities for underage and dangerous drinking,” according to the report.
Club-hosted parties have “reinforced a sense of sexual entitlement,” according to the report. The report cites student accounts of “parties at which the only non-members in attendance were women selected mainly by virtue of their physical appearance,” as well as party themes that portray women as “sexual objects.”
“Students pointed to competitive games between members where a man will ‘win’ a particular woman or compete for the most sexual triumphs,” the report says. The report states that some students worried about their safety when leaving parties. Freshmen women and women from other schools are particularly susceptible to the clubs’ “unsafe culture,” according to students referenced in the report.
Beyond the topic of sexual assault, the report criticizes the clubs for perpetuating what it calls social “exclusivity.”
“[F]reshmen men resent being denied entry to desirable social spaces and losing an opportunity to connect with female peers,” the report reads. “Excluded women feel the same resentment, while women who are included as guests are exposed to a culture often inimical to Harvard’s mission and over which women have little control.”
Other single-gender social clubs, though, including fraternities, sororities, and female final clubs, do not escape the report’s scrutiny.
“[We] recommend that any review of social spaces and Final Clubs include the role of fraternities, sororities, and other unrecognized single-gender social organizations at the College,” reads the report, noting that around 40 percent of female seniors participating in Greek life at Harvard reported sexual assault, compared to 31 percent of female seniors in general.
Still, the report focuses most of its rhetoric on final clubs.
“[The] problem goes beyond the number of sexual assaults that are completed or that originate in a Club’s physical spaces, as significant as that is,” the report reads. “Our outreach interviews indicate that Final Clubs have a disproportionate influence on campus culture.”
Even newly co-ed groups, such as the Spee and the Fox, however, may not be exempt from potential College oversight. While the report acknowledges that “the situation is fluid, with some clubs going co-ed and others considering it,” it recommends periodic College-conducted surveys to evaluate “the effectiveness of any changes undertaken by the Clubs or by the College as related to the Clubs.”
While the final report does not explicitly suggest prohibiting Harvard students from joining a single-sex organization, it does compel the College to produce a plan to “address the distinctive problems presented by Final Clubs.”
The report gives Khurana wide latitude to determine the scope and implementation of such plans.
“We… recognize that the University and the College are in the best position to determine the specific actions to address the problems presented by the Final Clubs,” reads the report. “[We] want to express our strong support for those actions that result in the elimination of discriminatory membership practices.”
“If those conversations fail to make progress, or if the transition by the Clubs to open and nondiscriminatory membership practices fails to address the issues we have identified in this report, we believe the University should not rule out any alternative approaches,” it adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences expressed gratitude and excitement for new and increased faculty research funds, which FAS Dean Michael D. Smith detailed in an email to faculty members last Thursday.
Two new initiatives will increase funding for faculty research by $25 million over the next five years, Smith wrote. Harvard researchers said they looked forward to making use of this money from FAS, especially in a landscape where the federal government increasingly has tightened its pursestrings.
“We all know that, of course, research is at the center of the whole enterprise,” Sociology and African and African American Studies professor Michèle Lamont said. “To get internal resources to empower it is very wonderful.”
The first monetary increase will raise the “small amount of discretionary money” that Smith annually distributes to every ladder faculty member, he wrote.
Smith will expand these funds, called the “Dean’s Distribution,” from its current $1,000 value to $2,000 dollars for “faculty with past sponsored research funding or in departments typically receiving sponsored research,” according to the email.
For the remaining faculty members, the Dean’s Distribution will increase from the current $1,000 to $4,000, Smith wrote, adding that the change “directs more discretionary funding towards those with fewer funding opportunities.”
Smith’s second initiative is a new grant fund, according to the email. Each semester, a small faculty committee will evaluate and award grant recipients between $5,000 and $50,000 each, Smith wrote, from a starting annual budget of $2.5 million.
The new grant fund, which Smith called the Dean’s Competitive Fund for Promising Scholarship, also will target projects that have not received external funding, that would not fit with “traditional funding programs,” and that would require upgrading research equipment, Smith wrote.
Citing strained national sources of funding, such as the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, Economics department chair David I. Laibson said he welcomed the new opportunities from FAS.
“A typical economist has many many projects, and we try to fund them from many different sources,” Laibson said.“This is another arrow in my quiver.”
Bioengineering and Applied Physics professor Kevin Kit Parker, who conducts research at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, said this kind of University funding specifically helps with cutting-edge projects that national grants might not aid.
“Peer review means that you’re basically constrained to a particular paradigm that’s supported by the masses,” Parker said, describing the constraints of national funding. “My mandate of being a professor at Harvard is that I better get out in front of the herd.”
Citing previous research examples such as the HIV and Zika viruses, Parker added that the government may not fund innovative work when research is just in its beginning stages. The University, however, has a different framework, he said.
“They are not giving me money to be comfortable,” Parker said. “That discomfort is what defines the cutting-edge.”
Laibson also said these FAS funding opportunities may allow him to pursue new projects.
“It’s exciting to me not because there’s a project right now that I’m going to go to the fund to try to support, but, rather, because I know there’s one more place I can go when I need funding in the future,” Laibson said.
In addition to the two initiatives, Smith wrote that he soon will establish a working group to investigate and streamline FAS’s online listing of funding opportunities for faculty members.

Connecting students around the world through high-tech monitors, the HBX Live studio has begun operating, and administrators are eager to support further development of the online service.
As part of HBX—the Business School’s online learning platform—HBX Live was added to the school’s digital learning repertoire in August with the goal of replicating the typical classroom experience.
HBX Live is housed in the WGBH public broadcast studio in Brighton. The space is custom designed with a high-resolution video wall that mimics the amphitheater seating style of a traditional Business School classroom.
So far, school affiliates have only used the HBX Live studio for “sessions,” including test runs with alumni, according to Michael P. Soulios, the senior production engineer and operations manager for HBX.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said the school began its foray into virtual education “three years ago with this question of what a completely different online experience would look like.”
“Our goal from the beginning was to have people feel as engaged as they do in our case method classes,” Nohria added. He said HBX is one of the areas he hopes to further invest in with funds from the Business School’s capital campaign.
The studio-based HBX Live and HBX CORe, the Credentials on Readiness program which serves as the online platform, are the two main components of HBX. HBX CORe does not have the same synchronous conversation or interaction that characterizes HBX Live.
According to HBX faculty chair Bharat N. Anand ’88, the goals of these two programs are very different.
“The Live studio is essentially saying: can we recreate this classroom discussion environment in a space where you collapse geography, where the only difference is that you don’t need the sixty people sitting right there with you in the room?” he said.
Anand added that HBX Live aims to recreate the “high energy and intensity” that exists in the classroom. It was first developed as a course for MBA students who wanted to brush up on introductory business skills before arriving on campus, according to Anand.
The course has since spread to undergraduates at several universities, as well as a variety of non-students who are simply interested in a primer on business.
Soulios tells faculty in the studio to not worry about the cameras or the podium, but rather to walk around and teach normally.
“Probably the hardest thing to simulate is that feeling of walking in and having all the cameras on you because it’s so visually arresting. But it just takes a few minutes to get used to,” he said.
Moving forward, Anand said he hopes to help develop specific programming for HBX Live, such as courses that span a certain amount of weeks.
“I think we’re closer to the starting point than the finish line,” he said.
Students can enroll in CORe for a fee, but undergraduates or graduates on financial aid can request to have their demonstrated need sent to the Business School for compensation up to 90 percent, according to Anand.
“It is a win-win,” he said. “For the students, of course, but also for us because we get to partner with other universities.”

A group of panelists discussed the faults of America’s current justice system in light of recent fatal conflicts between police officers and individuals in minority communities.

The event, titled “Divided We Fall: When Police and Communities Collide,” featured representatives from the police and the media, as well as policymaker and an activist at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday.
Garry McCarthy, a former superintendent of the Chicago Police Department who lost his job following Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke’s shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2014, spoke at the event. Van Dyke was caught on camera shooting McDonald 16 times.
"The answer is I had nothing to do with it,” McCarthy said. "If I was asked, I would have recommended that we don’t release it [the video] until the investigation has been concluded.”
McCarthy argued that, contrary to popular perception, modern police departments are in fact run more like corporations, with police shootings subject to civilian oversight and reviews by independent organizations.
Brittany N. Packnett, co-founder of Campaign Zero, an activist group that seeks to end police violence in America, argued that police departments are failing to provide justice to minority communities.
"We’re talking about entire systems that were set up to control marginalized people as property,” Packnett said. "Too often we do not treat the lived experience of marginalized people as real evidence.”
Tom Jackman, a reporter for The Washington Post, added that the department’s inability to craft an appropriate response caused part of the public backlash following McDonald’s death and other similar incidents.
"I don’t think the police do a great job of putting their side of the story out," he said.
Annise D. Parker, a former mayor of Houston, said the current justice system has much area for improvement and city officials should increase the racial diversity of their respective police forces.
"In the best of all possible worlds, you want a police department that looks like the community it polices,” Parker said. "Public safety is equally about the absence of crime as it is about the presence of justice."
China B. Terrell, a student at the Kennedy School who was in the audience, said people with different views must negotiate policy proposals together in order to successfully reform the justice system.
“We can waste our lives drawing lines, or we can live our lives crossing them,” she said.

The Climate Change Solutions Fund, started by University President Drew G. Faust, awarded 10 research projects more than $1 million in grants, around a $200,000 increase from last year, according to the Office of Vice Provost for Research.
Now in its second year, the program received 34 applications, up from 19 last year, according to assistant provost for research development and planning Elizabeth Langdon-Gray.
The fund selected more winners and awarded more grant money than last year. Despite the growth, Langdon-Gray said she expects the amount of funding available to stay around $1 million in future years.
Faust initiated the fund in April 2014 in order to promote efforts in global climate change research. This year’s 10 winning projects, all led by Harvard faculty, focus on a wide range of topics from greenhouse gas emissions to global climate change agreements.
One of the winning teams, whose leaders include Professor of Atmospheric and Environmental Science Steven C. Wofsy and Law School professor Wendy B. Jacobs, proposed a study to determine the source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Boston metro area and to make policy recommendations to address the issue.
“We found all this methane coming out into the atmosphere, but we would very much like to see a practical impact so the sources are reduced over time,” said Wofsy, who plans to recruit students to work with him.
Wofsy said that students who participate in his research project will have an unique opportunity to gain insights into the field that they may not typically study in a classroom. He added that in order for the project to have a real impact, the team will must communicate findings to policymakers, not just scientists.
Another recipient of the grant was a team led by Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins whose research seeks to inform how countries and international organizations can jointly combat climate change.
Stavins said his team began making concrete plans to advance the project as soon as they received word of the grant. His team has invited over a dozen experts on climate change negotiations to participate in a two-day research workshop on campus in June.
He said the project ultimately aims to attend the Marrakesh Climate Change Conference in November of 2016, where the team will present their ideas in front of 196 countries.
Langdon-Gray said one of the goals of the fund is to encourage interdisciplinary research that brings together scholars from various fields.
According to Wofsy, the required collaborative aspect of the research project encouraged him to go beyond his comfort zone in working with a law professor.
“It’s more than just a question of bringing people together from different disciplines,” he said. “We really use different language in talking about things, a different frame of reference. Just by bringing people together and working on a common problem, you kind of break down that barrier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention released a set of recommendations Tuesday afternoon, with implications for all of Harvard’s schools. Out of all schools, however, the report disproportionately focused on the College, given its “residential character,” and laid out a number of undergraduate-specific recommendations on undergraduate unrecognized single-sex social groups, alcohol policy, and sexual assault prevention trainings.
 Analyzing undergraduate life on a variety of fronts, the report recommends that administrators consider larger policy changes, including discouraging hard alcohol consumption through potential experiments of bans on hard liquor. The report also recommends augmenting funding for parties, decreasing entry points in Houses, and additional support for BGLTQ programming.
University President Drew G. Faust wrote an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday afternoon, with the report attached, in which she said she would accept the report’s “thoughtful recommendations.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent his own email to undergraduates shortly thereafter, writing that many recommendations are unique to the College—Harvard’s only school explicitly mentioned in the report’s 20 pages—and that the College would develop its own plan to address the recommendations and submit it to Faust by the end of this academic year.
In an interview Tuesday evening, Khurana said although he plans to address recommendations specific to the College, he still needs time to “read it really carefully, to try to understand all the nuances of the report, and then develop a plan.”
Undergraduates involved with sexual assault advocacy on campus, meanwhile, said they were pleased with the report’s proposals, but are now waiting for the College to take concrete steps.
“I think the biggest thing at this point is implementation,” Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said. “I think Harvard has said a lot of things about what they’re going to do... but until substantive actions are actually taken, I don’t know how much of their prevention efforts will be successful.”'
The report recommends yearly sexual assault prevention for all students at the University and standardized training for residential tutors—demands student activists have called for at a rally last semester.

The results of a sexual conduct climate survey released last semester showed  31 percent of female seniors who participated in Harvard’s sexual conduct climate survey reported experiencing "nonconsensual sexual contact" while at Harvard. At the time, Faust called the findings “deeply disturbing.”
According to the report, that number rose to 47 percent for female College seniors who participate in final club activities. According to the report, about 40 percent of female seniors participating in Greek life at Harvard reported sexual assault.
In Khurana’s email, he wrote he would specifically “address the issues raised in the report” about the College’s unrecognized single-gender social groups, and echoed much of the report’s rhetoric about unrecognized social groups serving as a key factor in the inaccessibility and exclusivity of the undergraduate social scene.
His email outlined no specific plan or policy proposals.
For Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, the mention of final clubs and other social groups in the report came as a surprise.
“I was pretty surprised to see such a strong stance on final clubs in the actual document… these really, really extensive comments that indicate statistically and anecdotally a lot of problems within the clubs,” Suslovic said. “It’s really, really exciting that there is administrative recognition [of final clubs] on a public level.”
Suslovic, previously a vocal critic of the clubs, penned an op-ed last April calling on the College to completely disband the groups. Suslovic said that in light of the survey results, the College should consider exercising some oversight over the clubs. In the past, some have questioned the legality of such a measure.
In his email, Khurana did outlined broad goals to work with the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the University’s Title IX Office, and the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion to implement annual sexual assault prevention trainings for all students. Currently, the College requires freshmen to complete an online alcohol education program called “Harvard Proof,” which the report recommended expanding to yearly and including a component on sexual assault.
Despite generally supporting the report, a number of students maintained reservations about the implementation of the task force’s recommendations in the long term.
One of the recommendations calls for the creation of a new position the Provost’s office to oversee sexual assault prevention and create working groups, but Fournier expressed concern that the creation of the new position would lead Harvard to “funnel” concerns and convert them to “non-actionable items.”
Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather '17 and Vice President Daniel “Danny” V. Banks '17 said they support the recommendations, and added that going forward they hope to facilitate discussions between final club members and College administrators.
“Danny and I will be involved in those conversations, and try to serve as a liaison between the two bodies that sometimes seem antagonistic,” Rather said.
The College administration has already taken steps in line with the report’s recommendations as far as centering social life away from unrecognized social groups is concerned. The report specifically commended the College-wide “[BLANK] Party” hosted by undergraduate women’s organizations this fall, and recommended continued moves to create social spaces in the Houses, similar to rooms created in Cabot and Adams Houses earlier this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks into their occupation of the lounge in the Law School’s Caspersen Student Center, student activists said they will remain in the hall, despite the concerns of other students and administrators.
Members of the student group Reclaim Harvard Law have occupied the lounge—which they have dubbed “Belinda Hall”—since Feb. 15 in order to create a space they say minorities on campus lack.
The occupation is part of an ongoing movement that began in November and has focused on calling for improvement in diversity at the Law School. While the school has addressed some of these demands—including convening a committee that recently recommended to change the school’s contentious seal—activists remain unsatisfied.
Over the past few weeks, occupiers have been sleeping, eating, and hosting daily events relating to critical race theory in the hall. Students from other schools, meanwhile, have joined in the effort.
“I think when we first started, we didn’t quite imagine exactly what it is we’re doing now,” Alexander J. Clayborne, a member of Reclaim Harvard Law and the group Royall Must Fall, said. “We’ve basically transformed the space into a school within a school.”
Some students, however, questioned the activists’ approach. One student critical of the occupation wrote an anonymous editorial in the Harvard Law Record, equating the activists to “bullies.”
The piece provoked a sharp, personal rebuttal from Law Record editor-in-chief Michael E. Shammas, who wrote that students in opposition to the occupation of the lounge self-censor by remaining anonymous.
Third-year Law student Steven B. Salcedo, who described his stance on activists’ demands as “ambiguous,” said he has found the protesters to be welcoming.
“The people who are protesting the lounge never turn people away,” he said. “Even though it’s an occupation, it allows other people to still participate and be in that space. They’ve been open, and that’s a good thing. It makes it a little less problematic in my mind.”
Still, Clayborne said he thinks dissenting students have generally shied away from the hall.
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, who visits the hall frequently to talk to students and observe the events hosted there, sent an email last week to Law School affiliates voicing several concerns.
“We have heard from students who are concerned that the lounge is not sufficiently available to all who wish to study or spend time there, and from others who feel that the atmosphere in the lounge has not been consistently welcoming of varied—including dissenting—views,” she wrote. “I am writing to remind everyone of the importance of keeping the lounge accessible and welcoming to everyone.”
The email also raised administrators’ concerns about hygiene and room upkeep, and directed students to the University and Law School policies on public protest. Clayborne said occupiers have taken steps to address these points by rearranging furniture and assisting staff with cleaning the hall.
Activists said they were disappointed by Sells’ email. Jordan C. Raymond, who recently penned an op-ed in The Crimson explaining why she chose to join occupiers, said she felt Sells’ message created “a false dichotomy” between activists and students with opposing views.
Clayborne took issue with the premise that activists’ presence in the hall was not welcoming to all students. “We felt that comment to be very ironic because the reason we’re here is because we feel unwelcome on campus all the time,” Clayborne said. “And we don’t do anything to exclude anyone from the space, so frankly I don’t know what that comment is referring to.”
Student occupiers say they will stay in the hall for the foreseeable future. “We’re staying until something legitimate happens from the administration in particular,” Raymond said.
According to Raymond, some activists plan to remain there over spring break to ensure that their occupation continues.

More than two years after Kenneth C. Griffin ’89’s record-breaking gift to Harvard in support of the College’s financial aid program, administrators said the gift has been impactful both for hundreds of undergraduates and potential donors.
Griffin, the founder and CEO of Citadel, a Chicago-based hedge fund, donated $150 million to Harvard in February 2014. The terms of his gift specifically allocate at least $125 million to new scholarship funds for the College—the financial aid office was renamed in Griffin’s honor the following fall.
Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue said the size of the gift, which was the largest amount ever donated to the College at the time of its announcement, has played a major role in inspiring other alumni to donate to financial aid.
“Financial aid has always been a way of contributing to Harvard that resonates deeply with alums,” Donahue said. But, she added, the publicity that surrounded Griffin’s gift was a very public reminder of the significance of alumni donations.
“People have a renewed sense of the fact that our program is possible thanks to the generosity of our scholarship donors,” Donahue added. “The fact that the office is now named the Griffin Financial Aid Office signals that to people who might not be exposed to that on a daily basis.”
Griffin’s gift benefits as many as 800 undergraduates every year. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 wrote in a statement that the gift has underscored the College’s “long-standing commitment” to accessibility regardless of financial means.
“Ken Griffin’s extraordinary gift has, and will continue to, transform the lives of many students at Harvard College,” Fitzsimmons said.
The donation was notable for a number of reasons beyond its record size. The gift was announced just one year into Harvard’s Capital Campaign, which is still underway as it nears a $6.5 billion goal for the University overall.
As part of the campaign, Harvard intends to raise $600 million for financial aid, meant to ensure the University’s financial aid program “continues to be as strong and robust and generous and supportive as it has been,” Donahue added.
The gift announcement also coincided with the 10th anniversary of Harvard’s Financial Aid Initiative, which provides support to low-income students and ensures that Harvard’s admissions process remains need-blind.
“My goal with this gift is to help ensure that Harvard’s need-blind admission policy continues, and that our nation’s best and brightest have continued access to this outstanding institution,” Griffin said in the 2014 press release announcing the donation.

UPDATED: March 9, 2016, at 2:45 p.m.
In the twenty-first year since the College randomized housing, freshmen will celebrate their final night as unassigned students with rituals and festivities that have ebbed and flowed over the last two decades.
The First Year Social Committee will hold a “Housing Day Eve Carnival” in Annenberg Hall from 9:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday evening, with games and activities available to all members of the freshman class.
“We really just see this as an opportunity for all of us to get together for one last time before we are assigned to Houses and get split up for the next three years,” said FYSC member Catherine L.  Zhang ’19.
According to Torey E. Martin, a fellow for First-Year programs at the Freshman Dean’s Office, Housing Day Eve parties have taken place every year since at least 2008 and have become one of the FYSC’s biggest and most widely-attended events of the year.
On Housing Day Eve night, some freshmen will also seek to participate in a less sanctioned activity known as river run, an annual Housing Day tradition in which some freshmen attempt to drink a shot of alcohol in all nine of the River Houses to appease the “River Gods” before receiving housing assignments.
In recent years, as administrators increased police presence and warned freshmen of partaking in river run, Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 has sought to reassure freshmen that there is nothing they can do to affect the outcome of the lottery.
“I am hearing a lot of wishes and fears in advance of the lottery which places students into the Houses,” Dingman wrote in an email to freshmen last year. “This may be one of the few instances in which students cannot control the outcome.”
Despite the statement, Lowell resident Benjamin F. Molin ’18 said he is convinced that  the River Gods played a role in his placement into Lowell House.
“The River Gods gave me the hook up,” Molin, who did not participate in river run, said. “They were looking out for me.”
By some accounts, the origins of river run can be traced back to the spring of 1996, when the College first randomized assignments into upperclassmen houses.
Out of fear of receiving an assignment into the Radcliffe Quad, then-freshman William F. Abely ’99 and his fellow blockmates devised a plan to make an offering to the River Gods. On that night, Abely said he and a crew made their way to Weeks Bridge, carrying with them a sacrificial offering: a plant that had rested in their dorm room since September.
“We bought the thing at a PBHA plant sale at the beginning of the year. As one might expect from a group of eighteen year old men, none of us ever watered it, so it just died and sat there,” Abely reflected. “This was a great excuse to get rid of it.”
Gathered at the bridge, one of the blocking group’s thespians read a hastily crafted incantation while standing on the ledge and then lit the plant on fire and hurled it into the River.
The next morning, they awoke to news that they had been placed in Leverett House, just throwing distance from the site of the ritual.
As a sophomore, Abely told a freshman friend, Adam G. Kosberg ’00, about the rite he performed with his blockmates the previous year.
In addition to reciting the incantation and igniting and tossing plants into the River as the previous ritual had done, Kossberg and his blockmates spent days leading up to the ritual making voodoo dolls, which he said they also to placate the River Gods.
The next day, Kossberg and his blockmates discovered they too had been placed in Leverett House, thus validating the ritual, according to Abely.
In recent years, river run has been met with increased security and scrutiny. As students largely traded the ritual sacrifices for individual libations, Harvard University Police have responded to the tradition by ramping up the number of on-duty officers at each of the Houses.
In a statement, HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano wrote that “HUPD as well as other local police jurisdictions are aware of the event and will work cooperatively to ensure that Wednesday night/Thursday morning is safe for everyone involved.”
Although he did not mention river run by name, in an email to freshmen on Tuesday evening, Dingman warned first year students of participating in certain pre-Housing day festivities.
“Should you choose to drink on Housing Day Eve, be prepared to accept consequences related to your actions,” he wrote.
This year, river running-freshmen will be met with a warm night, cloudy skies, and low of 55 degrees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the recent campus outbreak of mumps has altered the daily routines of quarantined students, greater social life—especially Housing Day plans—remain largely unaffected.
Many House Committees maintain that their plans for Housing Day, which is on Thursday, have not necessitated adjustments despite recommendations by Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira to avoid large social gatherings.
“When possible, we encourage members of the community to avoid dense social spaces and to practice good hygiene at all times,” Barreira wrote in an email to students on Friday.
In practice, the advice has not disturbed the efforts of the committees.
“I don’t think that this outbreak is so severe that it should disrupt one of the most important traditions at Harvard,” said Daniel V. Banks ’17, Dunster House Committee Co-Chair and Vice President of Undergraduate Council.
According to Alina M. Acosta, HoCo Co-Chair of Cabot, the outbreak has not affected their planning at all, but she said she has definitely noticed everybody trying to be more careful.
For students who have been relocated to receive isolated care, though, life on campus has not remained quite so uninterrupted.
Henry M. N. Brooks ’19, who has been quarantined at the Harvard Inn for four days now, said living is isolation has been strange and allows for no flexibility.
“It’s funny to be in this sort of plague where you’re not allowed to talk to anybody and people bring you meals,” Brooks said. “The rigidity of it all is really funny, but I get their intention with it.”
Still, Brooks considers himself “lucky,” since he will be released in time to take part in Housing Day celebrations and receive his upperclassman housing assignment.
The number of confirmed mumps cases at the University has not increased since last Wednesday when Barreira sent an email, which stated that six students on campus had contracted the virus. Students and patients report being largely satisfied with the swift response of HUHS to mitigate the outbreak.
“HUHS has done top grade job in keeping the student body informed,” Banks said.
Brooks said HUHS updates him periodically through the medical portal messaging system.
Overall, many students said they are not too weary about contracting mumps because of the relatively small number of people with the virus..
“Especially since most people who have contracted mumps are being quarantined and most symptoms are immediate and recognizable, like a swollen face, I’m not too stressed out about it,” John A. N. Matthews ’19 said. “I would have a greater fear of contracting the flu than contracting mumps at this point and time.”

After recently undergoing dramatic building renovations, the Harvard Art Museums will soon have new leadership as well, with Martha Tedeschi set to become the next director of the Museums in July.
Tedeschi—whose appointment the University announced Wednesday—comes to Cambridge by way of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she now works as the Deputy Director for Art and Research. She will succeed Thomas W. Lentz, who announced his departure from the post last year less than three months after the reopening of the renovated museums. 
“The Harvard Art Museums have been brilliantly reimagined by the recent renovation and I am exhilarated at the prospect of leading them at this moment to realize their enormous potential,” Tedeschi said in a statement.
A graduate of Brown University with a Ph.D. from Northwestern University, Tedeschi specializes in British and American art, with particular expertise in Early Modern European printmaking.
In the statement, University President Drew G. Faust said she looks forward to Tedeschi’s tenure.
“The arts are essential to the University’s highest purposes, and I look forward to the ways in which they will continue to flourish under her direction,” Faust said.
In November 2014, the Art Museums reopened after six years and $250 million worth of reconstruction and renovation. The construction combined the Fogg Museum, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum into a single complex, with the staff of all three museums working together for the first time to fill the 50 galleries.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 also lauded Tedeschi in a statement.
“The Harvard Art Museums are among the nation’s largest and most important art collections and are also a critical resource for research, teaching, and learning at Harvard,” Garber said. “Martha’s passion for teaching students across all disciplines and experience in training the next generation of scholars, curators, and conservators will enable her to advance the Museums’ academic and cultural missions.”
The Museums’ combined collections boast around 250,000 pieces from a myriad of historical time periods, geographic regions, and artistic disciplines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Devin Dwyer has played in 45 games in his collegiate career, and only once has he failed to tally at least one point. To find the last time he was kept off of the score sheet, you would have to go back to March 26th, 2013, when Harvard faltered, 16-7, against Albany in his freshman year.
Since then, Dwyer has recorded a point in 37 straight games.
The streak is good for the fifth longest active in the country, but even the four players ahead of him have not nearly had the season that Dwyer has been enjoying thus far. Through four games, he leads the nation with 6.25 points per game.
After scoring nine goals and adding four assists last week against Holy Cross (0-5) and UMass (2-3), Dwyer stayed hot this past weekend to lead the No. 12/12 Crimson  (4-1) past No. 4/4 Duke (4-2), 14-9. He recorded 4 goals and 2 assists against the Blue Devils, and at halftime, had as many points as they had goals.
“We’ve played them every single year I’ve been here, but we’ve never been able to beat them,” Dwyer said. “It was a great feeling to finally come through, especially in my senior year.”
Against Duke, Dwyer found success attacking the net from multiple angles and sets. In the first quarter, he snuck around the far post and collected a pass from sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek before putting away Harvard’s first goal.
Later in the game, when the Blue Devils were up 5-4, Dwyer quickly scored twice more to swing the momentum the Crimson’s way. One was a simple flick after senior midfielder Keegan Michel fed him the ball in transition, while the other was made possible by a sharp cut to the center of the field that allowed Dwyer to lose his defender.
With three timely goals in the second quarter, and also a key assist, Dwyer pushed Harvard well ahead of Duke, 10-5. The Crimson defense then stepped in, holding its opponents scoreless for the entirety of the third quarter and first 5:12 of the fourth as the offense added two insurance goals.
As time winded down, Dwyer added one final assist to senior midfielder Sean McDonagh to seal the 14-9 win. It was Dwyer’s third consecutive game with at least six points, as he now has 14 goals and 11 assists on the season. Both numbers are good for team best.
“I haven’t necessarily been doing anything differently compared to last season, but everything’s been coming together nicely in the past few weeks,” Dwyer said. “A lot of credit definitely has to go to my teammates. If you look at my goals, almost all of them this season have come off great assists.”
Dwyer’s approach might not be different, but a greater consistency has certainly defined his play this year. After reaching four or more points in a game only five times in 2015, he has recorded at least five through the first four games of 2016.
A big reason for the boost in his numbers has been his improved shooting, as Dwyer, after scoring 20 goals last season, already has 14 through four games. As it stands, Dwyer has a shooting percentage of 61.5 percent. To add to this, 73 percent of his shots are on goal.
Through four games, Dwyer is more than halfway to his point total of 49 last year. With nine games left in the regular season, Dwyer is on pace to have a career year.
“Devin’s always had the vision on the field that it takes to find teammates for great chances, and that’s been clear since his freshman year,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “This year, he’s been able to finish more plays off himself.”
As a senior, Dwyer’s contributions to the team go beyond game days, however. Even in a large graduating class of 15, his accomplishments have stood out and resonated with the rest of the team.
“He’s influential with his teammates because he brings a high level of play every day, whether it’s in practice or in a game,” Wojcik said. “He’s also a vocal leader who isn’t afraid to pull guys aside individually to give them tips. An all-around player and teammate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After pulling off two comeback victories in its first four games, the No. 8/7 Harvard men’s lacrosse team found itself in a hole once again Tuesday night against Bryant. Trailing 9-8 with 5:29 left in the game, the Crimson searched for the goal that would send the contest to overtime. With a 3-0 record so far this season in matches that have gone into extra periods, the team was hopeful it could still pull out a victory.
The Bulldogs, however, made sure there would be no late letdown in front of their fans at Bryant Turf Complex. Harvard did not manage another shot on goal until there were only 21 seconds left on the clock, and by that time, the Bulldogs had already pushed their lead to 12-8. With three goals in the span of 1:05, they turned the tables on the Crimson, who had previously outscored its opponents 19-10 in the fourth quarter or later.
Sophomore midfielder Sean Coleman added a consolation goal for Harvard before time ran out, but the end result was still a comfortable 12-9 margin for Bryant. The Crimson (4-1) are now in the unfamiliar position of having to rebound from a loss, while the Bulldogs (4-2), with the win, earned a split against the two Ivy League teams on its schedule. They were blown out by No. 6/6 Yale this past Saturday, 14-4.
“Start to finish, we didn’t bring the energy we needed to deserve a win,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We were sloppy on offense and made too many unforced errors, and credit to Bryant for taking advantage of that.”
While the Bulldogs dominated the latter stages of the game, the Crimson came out looking like the upstart team that upset No. 4/4 Duke just three days earlier. It raced out to a 4-1 lead after the first quarter, seeing contributions from the entire team as four different players scored.
In a preview of what was to come for both sides, only one of the five goals for either team in the first quarter came off of an assist. Harvard, which averaged 9.0 assists per game entering its contest against Bryant, went on to finish with an uncharacteristically low three assists for the entire game. The Bulldogs, despite scoring three more goals, only managed three assists in total themselves.
Bryant managed to pull closer in the second quarter, scoring three goals to the Crimson’s two, but the biggest momentum shift of the match came in the third quarter. Outshooting their opponents 19-5 over the 15 minutes, the Bulldogs were not only aggressive but also calculated with their plays. They held a majority of the possession in the quarter, and were it not for an impressive string of saves by Harvard sophomore goalie Robert Shaw, Bryant could have gone into the fourth period with a much larger lead.
“Shaw has been the constant on this team throughout our five games,” said Crimson defender and co-captain Stephen Jahelka. “His strong performances have kept us in games, coming up with key saves when we needed them.”
As it was, the Bulldogs were up 7-6 and had seized the lead for good. They added two more goals to cap a 5-0 run and push the score to 9-6, and Harvard never completely recovered. Bryant junior midfielder Ryan Sharpe tallied two goals during the surge, completing the hat trick after scoring in the second quarter as well. Later in the fourth, Sharpe’s teammate and sophomore attackman Cam Ziegler also scored a crucial goal to put the game away. He finished with two goals on the night.
“Coming out of the half, I think they won the first five minutes of the third quarter,” Jahelka said. “They set the tone in terms of playing more physical and picking up more ground balls, [while] we were flat.”
In the loss, Crimson senior attackman Devin Dwyer still made an impact with two goals and an assist. The three points feel short of the blistering 6.25 points per game pace he had set in the first four games of the season, however. For Bryant, junior midfielder Ryan Sharpe collected a hat trick, but no other player had more than two points.
“It was certainly a letdown for the team, but now, we have to learn from this and make the right adjustments for Saturday,” Wojcik said. “We have to be ready to move on and not let this loss hang over us.”

Housing Day, aka one of the rare times during the school year we show an immense outpour of school spirit, is coming up on Thursday! While upperclassmen are bickering away with their friends about how their own house’s housing day videos are “objectively” the best, freshmen are probably anxious to figure out where they will be living for the next three years (and if you’re looking for some facts on all the houses, check out Flyby’s Housing Market). To demystify Housing Day a little for the Class of 2019, Flyby has put together some Housing Day terms you should acquaint yourselves with, and we’ve also taken the liberty to make up names for common experiences we’ve all had on Housing Day but don’t really know what to call them:
N-1 Housing“N” stands for the number of people living in a room, so using some impressive math skills, we’re here to tell you that n-1 housing means one fewer room than the number of residents. This is probably a term freshmen will encounter when assigned rooms for the next school year because a lot of sophomores in River Houses will live in doubles.
Storming the Yard/DormstormingEvery morning on Housing Day, houses will compete with each other to be the first to get to the yard. Eventually, this will turn into mobs of upperclassmen dressed in house gear heckling one another about whose house is best. House mascots will dance around the crowd, tourists will become immensely confused and snap pictures, and freshmen will peer out of their windows anxiously.
River RunSome say you make a visit to each of the 12 houses the night before, others say you take a shot at each house, and some have set to fire miniature boats with names of houses they either did or did not want on the Charles. In any case, there’s always heightened HUPD surveillance on Housing Day eve, so stay safe everyone—the last thing you want to do is receive disciplinary action for attempting to take a shot of good old Rubinoff.
Blocking Group SleepoverThe night before Housing Day, blocking groups typically congregate in the room they asked for their housing letters to be delivered too. The sleepover agenda typically includes outdoing one another in knowing more facts about every house, analyzing the cinematic qualities of each housing day video, getting no sleep, and making fun of that one blockmate who has a midterm and is in Lamont.
*THE* Linking Group TextQuite possibly the worst or best spoiler alert ever—when your linking group gets their housing assignment first and sends a group message to your blocking group about which house they got. Warning: they could also be lying to mess with your current state of fragility. Maybe it’s better to just put your phones on airplane mode, just in case.
Quad TearsSome people cry in public when a Quad House storms their room and tells them they got quadded. Don’t do this.
Annenberg LunchThe Houses basically take over Annenberg Thursday afternoon, with upperclassmen standing on tables and cheering. Your house specifically will shower you with love by giving you free House gear that will ultimately become gym attire or PJs. This is typically the time and place where every freshman will Instagram a picture of their blocking group with the caption #wewonthelottery.
