After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On Thursday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan ’86 urged universities to change the way they prepare teachers, exclaiming that a “revolutionary change” was necessary to change the “mediocre” state of many teacher-training programs at education schools. Duncan is correct in his judgment of teacher preparation; there are many ways the training process for teachers can be improved to prepare them better for the realities of the classroom.
A recent report found that 60 percent of teachers did not feel prepared to teach after graduating from education school. An important step toward remedying this problem would be to introduce more practical training into the teacher education process. To deal with classroom management—which many teachers have cited as a challenge—especially at struggling schools, teachers should be exposed to a substantial amount of hands-on classroom training to improve their ability to nurture and develop the skills of their students.
Just as doctors are educated by going through an intensive residency process, teachers will benefit most from more exposure to the classroom. And while receiving practical training, teachers should be evaluated using objective statistical methods, so that they have a reliable means by which to measure their progress and improve their abilities.
Alternative programs such as Teach for America have shown the value of giving teachers immediate classroom experience and should be noted as an example of the value of learning through doing. As education schools attempt to reform and improve their methods, they should consider incorporating the ideas of TFA and the New York City Teaching Fellows program, which places novice teachers in struggling districts.
Improving our education system and teacher training methods is a complicated process, and increasing practical training is only one of many steps needed to address these issues. To be able to prepare children for the 21st century, teachers should also be trained to incorporate technology and Internet applications in the classroom, for example.
In the end, any amount of teacher knowledge of a subject area will be irrelevant if teachers are not able to effectively impart this knowledge to students. Thus, there is little to be lost by giving developing teachers more experience in the classroom. Education for the young is the bedrock of our society and economy, and if education schools can change their methods so that teachers can more effectively reach struggling children, they will be doing students and the country a great service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A rowdy crowd, a frail stage, and miscommunication led to a short but memorable GirlTalk performance at last year’s Harvard-Yale pep rally. The event, which precedes the annual Harvard-Yale football game, was shut down by HUPD for safety reasons, and DJ GirlTalk was forced to exit the stage early as the crowd continued to push against the weak stage. It was the first time the College Events Board had brought in a big name artist for the pep rally, and it may well be the last. This year, CEB has wisely decided to return to a more traditional format by having student groups perform—making the pep rally more Harvard focused.
Though the event might not attract such a sizeable crowd this year, the decision was good, given current circumstances. The CEB’s budget has shrunk due to the financial crisis, and hence, it cannot afford to pay for a professional artist. In addition, its funds would be better spent on Yardfest in the spring, anyway, since that event draws more students and is generally more enjoyable given the better weather. Booking an appealing artist for Yardfest should be CEB’s priority.
Allowing student groups to perform at the pep rally in place of a big name performer is also a great way to showcase student talent. The Harvard focus of this more traditional format will help to foster more school spirit. CEB chair Kevin M. Mee ’10 has alluded to this: “I definitely think we would’ve moved in this direction, anyway, towards focusing back on the core focus of a pep rally, which was lost a little bit last year.”
Of course, student behavior at last year’s pep rally might have also influenced the CEB’s decision. We would not be surprised if this was a large factor in the decision to alter the format of this year’s pep rally. CEB was subject to close scrutiny and criticism last year after the GirlTalk fiasco. It would be hard to blame CEB for wanting to avoid putting itself in such a situation again.
Nevertheless, the new format is welcome especially for making the event more Harvard themed and for showcasing student talent. We look forward to a safe, fun event before the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Cruisin’ down the freeway, windows down. Wind in your hair. Signs flashing. Sun setting. And the first few notes of that song—the one you’ve been waiting for—suddenly float from the radio.
In that second, there’s a moment of connection. Somehow, somewhere, someone understands exactly how you feel right now. A DJ, sitting behind a desk with headphones firmly in place, chose that artist, picked that album, selected that track. And you, miles away, know exactly why.
But the radio changes, just like everything else. A few years back, I hit preset number three in my ancient Ford Taurus station wagon, but to my dismay, the familiar jingle of Arrow 93.1 was nowhere to be heard. The station was gone—replaced by the anonymous, jockey-free “Jack FM.”
Stations like “Jack”—such as Boston’s 93.7 “Mike FM”—advertise their lack of disc jockeys as an advantage, claiming that listeners benefit from more music and less talk. On the surface, it’s true: I much prefer rocking out uninterrupted versus waiting for that overly enthusiastic voice to shut it and play the music already.
Still, regardless of this perk, something just feels wrong about Jack and Mike. In place of human conversation, a sarcastic male voice now greets 93.1’s Los Angeles listeners with the same schtick every time. Clearly, he’s too cool for school, he’s anti-establishment, he has nothing to do with those saccharin-sweet DJs who clog up the airways—because he’s a recording and doesn’t waste your time with old-fashioned niceties.
Despite his rebellious tone, this disembodied voice represents the radio industry’s best attempt to stay in business. In the face of iPod proliferation, YouTube listening, and online radio streaming, the traditional dial is in the midst of a crisis. Americans have turned away from FM and AM, and they don’t seem to be turning back any time soon. Desperate, stations have tried to innovate. The BBC reported over two years ago: “In an attempt to woo listeners, a number of them are broadening their playlists, putting all the tunes on shuffle and ditching the DJs altogether.” Why did the BBC pick up the story? Because all of a sudden, America’s Jack FM had hit Oxford, too.
In the end, this new form of radio could just as well be an iPod—the only difference being that it’s not your particular iPod and therefore provides some variety. But listeners don’t just tune in to the radio for a new song or two. We switch on the dial for the community we find there, confident that a population of other listeners is singing along to the same tune we’re humming. When we pull up to a stoplight and hear an identical bass beat out of the car by our side, we forge an unspoken connection with that anonymous driver. And, ultimately, we feel like there’s a person out there orchestrating it all—someone who cares deeply about the tune that played before, and the one that will play next. When you’re driving down that highway well past 1 a.m. and the lanes are empty as your headlights cut through the night, there’s nothing like knowing that somewhere, far away, you’ve got company.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

T hough True Love Revolution is an organization that has made much ado about standing for “objective truth,” its application of feminism to its argument for traditional marriage and abstinence is ethnocentric, misleading, and inaccurate.
In a new series of platform statements, TLR claims to support “true feminism,” which the club defines as recognition of “inherent physical, behavioral, emotional, and psychological differences between men and women.” Though TLR asserts that women nonetheless deserve equality under the law, the club bases its arguments for a traditional family on the complementary nature of gender roles and claims that a monogamous relationship between a man and a woman has been recognized throughout history and cultures as the ideal foundation for a family. Not only does this argument smack of essentialism and ignore empirical evidence that refutes the inferiority of same-sex parenting, but it is also made exclusively from a contemporary Western, Judeo-Christian perspective that ignores the presence of polygamy in many African and Muslim countries as well as its prevalence throughout history.
In response to backlash over their controversial new platform, TLR co-president Rachel L. Wagley ’11 e-mailed the Radcliffe Union of Students e-mail list and attended a club meeting to address what she considered to be misconceptions about the club. Misinterpreting the book by Ariel Levy, “Female Chauvinist Pigs,” as a work that argues against “societal dangers of second-wave feminism and sexual mania,” Wagley claims that feminism has gone too far and that women today have lost dignity as a consequence. Wagley should be commended for defending her viewpoints before a less than receptive audience, but her response betrays her ignorance of feminist history and suggests that TLR’s claim to true feminism is simply a misapplication of feminist principles.
Feminism is hardly the culprit behind the hypersexualization of young women. The goal of second-wave feminism was not—as Wagley suggests—to allow for the proliferation of sexually explicit media and self-exploitation à la “Girls Gone Wild.” In fact, most feminists, including Ariel Levy, would concur that the pressure to conform to a sexual script is a problem that ought to be addressed not by restricting sex, but by removing stigmas surrounding sexual behavior, which includes abstinence, promiscuity, and everything in between. Rather than blaming feminism as the cause of rampant sexuality, Wagley ought to examine the profit agenda behind the rise of pornography, a point already made frequently in critical feminist literature.
While I, too, recognize that so-called “raunch culture” is hardly liberating, I disagree that objectionable displays of sexuality can be addressed by curtailing sexual activity. TLR’s blanket rejection of premarital sex ignores that there can be room for empowered sexual expression, and, while there is nothing feminist about pornography made for the male gaze, I’m hesitant to write off any and all displays of female sexuality and any and all sexual activity without regard to the nuances of individual decision-making. That, after all, is the ultimate feminist crime.
TLR is nothing if not anti-feminist, because its very mission is based on restricting others’ decisions. Wagley assured RUS members that the club does not advocate legal restrictions on sexual behavior. In a recent blog entry, co-president Leo J. Keliher ’10 stated a similar point. But if TLR truly has no interest in political advocacy, then why would Wagley state in a question-and-answer session with the Institute of Politics that TLR was one of several “social policy initiatives” with which she was involved? Why would the club post a blog entry—later deleted—encouraging members to submit testimony against sex education in Massachusetts? At best, these inconsistencies indicate that the club has yet to determine its precise objectives. At worst, it is being deliberately disingenuous in claiming that TLR’s mission is without political agenda.
There’s nothing wrong with politicizing. Plenty of student organizations mobilize their members for advocacy purposes, but the difference between TLR and organizations like the Queer Students Alliance or the RUS is that the latter are transparent about their efforts. More importantly, they do not promote a one-size-fits-all lifestyle, nor do they presume to know what choices are the best choices for each individual to make. That itself is the very foundation of feminism: The belief that people have a right to live without being subject to gendered expectations. From what I’ve deduced from TLR’s platform, there seems to be little room for gender non-conformity and even less room for choice.

That, after all, is the ultimate feminist crime.
TLR is nothing if not anti-feminist, because its very mission is based on restricting others’ decisions. Wagley assured RUS members that the club does not advocate legal restrictions on sexual behavior. In a recent blog entry, co-president Leo J. Keliher ’10 stated a similar point. But if TLR truly has no interest in political advocacy, then why would Wagley state in a question-and-answer session with the Institute of Politics that TLR was one of several “social policy initiatives” with which she was involved? Why would the club post a blog entry—later deleted—encouraging members to submit testimony against sex education in Massachusetts? At best, these inconsistencies indicate that the club has yet to determine its precise objectives. At worst, it is being deliberately disingenuous in claiming that TLR’s mission is without political agenda.
There’s nothing wrong with politicizing. Plenty of student organizations mobilize their members for advocacy purposes, but the difference between TLR and organizations like the Queer Students Alliance or the RUS is that the latter are transparent about their efforts. More importantly, they do not promote a one-size-fits-all lifestyle, nor do they presume to know what choices are the best choices for each individual to make. That itself is the very foundation of feminism: The belief that people have a right to live without being subject to gendered expectations. From what I’ve deduced from TLR’s platform, there seems to be little room for gender non-conformity and even less room for choice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Social-science superstars Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner and Slate music critic Jonah Weiner all triggered firestorms in the past week by endorsing propositions most sensible people would find absurd. Levitt and Dubner’s sequel to “Freakonomics,” the ever-creatively titled “Superfreakonomics,” included a chapter on global warming urging complacency and riddled with inaccuracies, from its assertion that curbing carbon emissions cannot prevent catastrophic climate change (it can) to its argument that solar panels contribute to global warming because they are black and radiate heat (they don’t, and in fact most are blue). Weiner, meanwhile, argued that the late-’90s atrocity of a band—Creed—is underrated.
As one would expect, each piece of nonsense triggered a strong counter reaction. Environmental bloggers and advocacy groups jumped on Levitt and Dubner, picking apart each and every piece of misinformation that they are using their fame to spread. Criticism of Weiner was centered on Twitter, where users offered satirical “Slate pitches” with theses as ridiculous as the notion that Creed has any redeeming value, like “Suicide: Why it might not actually kill you” or “Bank of America: Too awesome to fail.”
But while Slate took its criticism in stride, joking that it might actually publish some of these suggested stories, Levitt and Dubner were deeply offended that someone would take them to task for their sloppiness. “I just don’t get it,” Levitt lamented, adding that he didn’t think that “any environmentalist who really cares about the Earth’s future” could attack the duo. Dubner dismissed the criticism as a “smear” and a “partisan attack.” The implication was clear: Only a person who cared nothing about the planet, or a complete hack, could possibly criticize Levitt and Dubner’s spunky, counterintuitive take.
Such is the state of counterintuitive journalism these days. It used to be that purposefully contrarian journals like The New Republic or Slate used this angle as a means of slyly critiquing received wisdom, with full awareness—as seen in Slate’s response to mockery of the Creed article—that opposing the conventional wisdom was no more a guarantee of truth than buying conventional wisdom itself. They accepted criticism of their methods in the way they hoped establishment institutions would, with Slate even using its 10th anniversary to give four of the magazine’s critics article space in which to air their grievances.
But as Levitt and Dubner’s response suggests, the burden of proof has shifted. If one echoes the conventional wisdom, one must be a pawn of the establishment. If one challenges it, one is a brave truth-teller. It is a convenient posture, allowing careless writers like the “Freakonomics” duo to publish straight-up falsehoods in mass-market books and plead persecution when called out. But it also permits contrarians to traffic in the same fallacies and factual errors of which they so often accuse more mainstream writers. Perhaps most alarmingly, it allows them to misidentify what “mainstream” views entirely.
This is the proximate root of the “Superfreakonomics” debacle. Levitt and Dubner wanted to write about global warming, but they wanted to do it in such a way that was original and impugned the status quo. From the book, it seems like the following characterizes the status quo: a corporate system that allows ever-escalating carbon emissions, as well as a government patently unwilling to expend the monetary and political capital needed to stop catastrophic climate change.
However, Levitt and Dubner decided that criticizing the real culprits would not be counterintuitive enough. So instead, they embraced a motley crew of technological cranks who dismiss proven technologies like solar power in favor of utopian, untested schemes like cooling the earth through simulated volcano eruptions. Thus, they ended up criticizing the dissidents trying to limit carbon emissions rather than the status quo that allows such emissions free rein.
This type of misidentification has led to disaster in the past. After September 11th, a similar contrarian impulse led liberals to use books like Paul Berman’s “Terror and Liberalism” and magazines like, yes, The New Republic to argue in favor of war with Iraq against a perceived “liberal establishment.” The end result: a sturdy liberal infrastructure backing the real establishment, namely the Bush administration, as it launched America into the greatest foreign-policy disaster since Vietnam. As with Levitt and Dubner, contrarianism was co-opted into vigorous support for the status quo.
Again, there is nothing wrong in principle with contrarianism that is accurately targeted and aware of its limitations. Indeed, it is often a helpful tool for challenging real orthodoxies. But, as Levitt and Dubner show, a self-serious, sloppy contrarianism only ends up entrenching the status quo it seeks to critique.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College accepted over 93 percent of the undergraduates who applied to stay on campus during this year’s inaugural January break—1,316 of the 1,404 students who submitted applications—according to College spokesman Jeff A. Neal.
Students received e-mails around 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon—a week and a half after applications were due—notifying them of their housing decisions and the days that they will be permitted to stay on campus.
According to Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer, most students who fell into the categories previously outlined by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds—including thesis writers, members of 19 varsity winter sports teams, international students, and students working in labs—were approved.
Ameer said that while 1,316 students had been approved to stay on campus, the number of students actually on campus at any given time will hover around 1,000—the administration’s original stated target for the number of students.
While there are no plans to search dorm rooms for unapproved students, there may be consequences for anyone who tries to remain on campus without permission, Ameer said.
Some other students not in the categories outlined by Hammonds were also granted permission to stay on campus during J-Term, including members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and The Harvard Crimson.
“I was very impressed with how thoughtful people were in their applications,” Ameer said.
William R. Rose ’11, one of two students appointed by the Undergraduate Council to the committee that reviewed the J-Term applications, said that the committee did not receive any “ridiculous applications.”
Committee members reviewed applications as they were submitted and informed applicants of their decision 11 days after the Oct. 15 application deadline.
“I appreciated the turnaround time of the announcement on housing, and I was very impressed that they were able to award such a high percentage of students housing,” said UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10.
Students’ Harvard University ID cards will only be activated for the days that they have been approved to be on campus, Ameer said.
Freshman dorms will open for J-Term on Jan. 3, while the Houses will remain open through the winter break, which begins on Dec. 22. As varsity sports teams have done in the past, freshmen remaining on campus in December will stay with upperclassmen until their dorms reopen in January.
Tutors and proctors will remain on campus during J-Term, and shuttles will run on the same schedule as during the academic year, Ameer said.
Annenberg Hall will be the only dining facility open during the three-week-long period. The Malkin Athletic Center will be closed during the break, but the Hemenway Gym and the Quad Recreational Athletic Center (QRAC) will stay open.
Ameer said that she will send an e-mail providing greater detail about the rules for J-Term housing within the next two weeks, after she meets with more House officials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kenzie Bok ’11 and Sarah E. Esty ’11 will be running as an uncontested ticket for President and Vice President of the Institute of Politics Student Advisory Committee, IOP student leadership announced early yesterday morning.
Bok and Esty, who are blockmates in Pforzheimer House, will have three weeks to articulate their platform before the November 15 elections, in which 263 Harvard students affiliated with the IOP will be eligible to vote.
Bok’s expected ascension to the head IOP executive position will mark the fourth consecutive year in which the IOP has been led by a woman and the third time in the past five years in which only one candidate has sought the presidency.
Current IOP President Mary K.B. Cox ’10 said that while the uncontested elections may appear to be the result of the “uber-political” nature of IOP students, the actual causes are structural.
When there are only a handful of students qualified to run, it is hard to form multiple tickets, especially “when you factor in that some people don’t want the job and some people don’t want to run against friends of theirs,” Cox explained.
She added that the IOP may attempt to increase competition in the future by decoupling the presidential and vice presidential positions. Bok, who currently serves as chair of the IOP Fellows Program, said she had mixed emotions upon learning Monday that she would run unopposed.
While she said she was excited to avoid potential divisiveness, she did not want to lose the sense of engagement that comes with a campaign.
“One of the main projects of the next three weeks is convincing people who no longer have to make up their mind about the ticket that they should still talk to us about our platform,” Bok said.
She added that she was excited to set up such meetings and to begin speaking to students about issues that matter to them.
“The likely expansion of my coffee and pizza budget does not get me all that excited, but talking to people about their experience at the IOP and where it can go from here really does,” she said.
Bok cited J-Term as one of the most important issues she hopes to work on as President.
“We are looking to see how the IOP could be involved in doing some sort of pilot work to see what it would look like to have student-initiated programming for J-Term,” Bok said.
Bok and Esty will also be inheriting a number of IOP community-building programs instituted by Cox, who said she hopes her successors—both of whom she said she counts as friends—could expand upon her work.
“I think the general sense at the IOP over the past year is that we’ve spent a lot of time on community and developing members-at-large and holding social events,” Cox said. “I think we now need to swing the pendulum out a little bit toward [Harvard] outreach.”
Cox said she had no doubt that Bok and Esty would be up to the challenge.
“This is not just their job, their extracurricular nine to five,” Cox said. “It’s a place that they really love.”

Randomly selected Harvard undergraduates and their friends will report their popularity and flu-like symptoms as participants in a new Harvard Medical School study seeking to explain how social networks affect the spread of diseases.
“By looking both at whether you’ve had the flu and where you are in the social network, we think you can get an early warning of an epidemic,” said HMS professor and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis, who is conducting the study.
Christakis added that he did not want to reveal the details of his hypothesis for fear of potentially corrupting the results of the study. But he said that if there is no H1N1 epidemic, his “experiment will be a flop.”
Last Friday, Christakis sent e-mails to 650 randomly selected undergraduates, asking them to sign up to self-report their flu symptoms twice a week for 12 consecutive weeks. The participating students were also asked to nominate two to three friends, who will be asked to take part in the study as well.
When the study’s participants first sign up, they are also asked questions about how popular they are.
In exchange for participating in the study, the students will receive a $5 gift card to JP Licks every other week while the study is in progress.
“If this works, we’ll have invented a new method for attacking diseases, which could have broad relevance far outside Harvard,” Christakis said.
He added that he hopes that at least 75 percent of the students he e-mailed enroll in the confidential study. He said that the study will not report sick students to University Health Services.
Since the study may signal an early warning for a potential H1N1 epidemic, Christakis said he has garnered support from both the College and UHS.
“I think it’s a rather unique study,” UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 said. “It will be a fascinating work.”

The New Research Building at Harvard Medical School has been named one of the recipients of the annual Merit Award for Design Excellence from the New England Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA).
The individual state chapters within the New England Chapter rotate annually to host the Design Awards Program, and this year the New Hampshire Chapter selected 11 recipients from 271 entries.
“[The award] signifies good design, [and] good sustainable features,” said Carolyn Isaak, the executive director of the New Hampshire Chapter. “The jurors spent a lot of time...to find the projects, and the significance is that they’ve done outstanding work and we’ve honored it.”
Other recipients of this year’s Merit Award include the Integrated Sciences Building at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Pierce Hall at Kenyon College in Ohio, and the Carl J. Shapiro Science Center at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.
The New Research Building, which opened on Sept. 24, 2003, covers 525,000 square feet and cost approximately $260 million to build, according to an article in The Harvard Gazette.
It began as a project between Harvard Medical School and Architectural Resources Cambridge (ARC), a national architectural design firm that specializes in institutional facilities.
Arthur Cohen, the founding principal of ARC, said the ARC “is very pleased to receive this prestigious award from the AIA.”
The building, located close to Boston Latin School in Longwood, accommodates the Medical School’s department of genetics and department of pathology.
“Essentially it was built so that the common areas intersect,” said HMS spokesperson David J. Cameron. “They want people to be overlapping and interacting with each other.”
He added that the New Research Building differs from typical research facilities that house rows of labs along corridors and structurally prohibit the workers from interacting.
Christian Panasuk, the director of sales and marketing at the Joseph B. Martin Conference Center located in the building said that the “beautiful” public space could easily be filled with research posters.
“The conference space open to the public is first rate, it’s awesome,” Panasuk said. “Architecturally, acoustically, and visually, it’s easy for people to concentrate for a very long time.”

Theodore R. Sizer, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and innovative educational reformer, died last week of colon cancer at his Harvard, Mass., home at the age of 77.
Sizer, who was known as the “boy dean” on campus after being selected as Dean of the GSE at the age of 31, had to grapple with the societal upheaval of the 1960s during his term, including the Vietnam War and student riots, according to Patricia A. Graham, a professor of the history of American education and another former dean of the GSE.
During the 1969 campus riots, Graham said Sizer served as a mediator between students and University administrators, because “he was the youngest dean, and administration thought that he could best relate to the rioters.”
Although Sizer had a “baptism under fire,” he had “the temperament to lead,” according to his close friend and former GSE Associate Dean Arthur G. Powell.
“Even people who disagreed with his ideas respected him as a person...which was not an automatic thing,” Powell said.
Powell added that Sizer wanted to focus education around the culture that children grew up in instead of just directing all attention to what happened in school. He recalled a day when Sesame Street characters Big Bird, Bert, and Ernie put on a show in the Science Center after research by a colleague on early childhood education that Sizer had promoted.
“There was never a happier moment in a decade that was difficult,” Powell said.
Sizer graduated from Yale with a degree in English in 1953, and went on to serve in the Army and to work as a high school teacher. He then received his A.M. and Ph.D. from the GSE.
Shortly thereafter, then-University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 named him GSE Dean in 1964. Sizer left Harvard in 1972 to become the headmaster at Philips Academy Andover, and in 1994 was named Department Head for Education and Director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University.
In 1984, he collected his thoughts on education in his book “Horace’s Compromise,” which Powell said helped Sizer “find his voice” and served as inspiration for the Coalition of Essential Schools, which emphasizes the role of students as workers and of teachers as coaches.
In an e-mailed statement, Sizer’s close friend Professor Howard E. Gardner ’65, wrote that, “in our time Ted Sizer was the pre-eminent proponent and spokesperson for progressive education, the one form of education that is distinctly American.”

According to Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk, writing a novel is a lot like playing a game of chess.
At his lecture in a crowded Sanders Theatre yesterday, the Turkish novelist said that most writers attempt to guess how a reader will respond to their writing, just as a chess player makes his move in anticipation of his opponent’s next move in a chess game.
The hour-and-a-half lecture—Pamuk’s fifth in the Charles Eliot Norton lecture series—was entitled “Museums and Novels.”
“The museum-like quality of novels is about preservation, conservation, and resistance to being forgotten,” said Pamuk, who is the Robert Yik-Fong Tam Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University.
Pamuk began the lecture by telling the audience how he had collected items he thought were unique. Not only did Pamuk incorporate these items in his latest book, “Museum of Innocence,” but he also said that he plans to open a museum featuring these items in July 2010.
The lecture mainly focused on the feelings readers experience while reading novels—Pamuk categorized these feelings into two main groups, ”inadequacy” and “vanity.”
“Readers find the sensational experiences that are missing in their lives in a novel,” Pamuk said, describing the former. “The more powerful and persuasive the novel is, the more inadequate the reader feels,”
He added that readers often feel “inadequate” once they realize that the world created by the novel is imaginary.
Pamuk’s second category, “vanity,” referred to the extent to which a reader becomes invested in a novel.
“Vain possessiveness emerges in us because we...feel [the novel] was written for us, and only we understand it,” he said.
Steven Biel—a History and Literature lecturer and the executive director of the Humanities Center—said Pamuk has delivered “compelling” lectures in the series, which is sponsored this year by the Humanities Center.
“I find myself very often agreeing and being provoked—all of the things one wants from a lecture,” Biel said.
Namrata Baral ’12, who said she has read Pamuk’s “My Name is Red,” echoed Biel’s sentiments.
“Reading a novel after this lecture is going to be very different, and will provoke new feelings,” she added.

University Health Services announced yesterday that it has obtained additional seasonal flu vaccines and will be rescheduling multiple graduate school clinics that it had initially suspended last week due to a vaccine shortage.
Undergraduate flu clinics were not included among the temporarily suspended clinics.
“I’m absolutely relieved that the supply is here,” said Dorothy Wilder, a nurse at the Law School clinic. “We’re trying to vaccinate as many people as possible.”
In total, there are five remaining flu clinics this week, which will take place today through Thursday. Two of these clinics will be held at undergraduate house dining halls—Mather is scheduled for tonight and Eliot for tomorrow night.
The other three clinics, which will be located at the Graduate School of Education, the Law School, and the School of Public Health, were newly scheduled yesterday.
According to UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59, UHS has ordered about 19,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccines this year.
He said that UHS has already administered 16,000 vaccines this year—about 33 percent more than the approximately 12,000 doses given out last year.
Last week, when a distributor failed to deliver 1,600 additional doses on time, UHS was forced to cancel several of its final clinics at the graduate schools.
“Some people were upset,” Wilder said. “We had no idea that we would not receive the vaccine that was scheduled to show up [last week].”
Those doses were later delivered during the weekend.
According to a UHS statement, UHS has slightly more than 2,000 seasonal flu vaccines left in stock when combined with vaccines on hand and those obtained from other providers.
“We are pleased to be able to organize one more rounmade available “soon” by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Rosenthal added.
UHS has ordered between 12,000 and 13,000 doses of H1N1 vaccines. Rosenthal said the first shipment will be reserved for people designated high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—including pregnant women, medical services personnel, and caretakers of young children.
UHS has a list of about 300 to 400 people at the University who qualify as high-risk and who will receive the vaccine when it first arrives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun L.S. Donovan ’87 discussed the need to put housing development initiatives in the context of broader public concerns such as education and energy efficiency in a speech at the Graduate School of Design last night.
Donovan, who served as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development beginning in 2004, was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead HUD through a severe housing crisis that has contributed to the worst economic slowdown since the Great Depression.
“Millions of foreclosures have sent America’s economy into a tailspin,” Donovan said at the speech. “The nature of this crisis has revealed the need for a new direction.”
As the featured speaker at the 10th Annual John T. Dunlop Lecture, Donovan presented a sampling of the Obama administration’s plans for new housing initiatives to a crowd packed with hundreds of students, professors, and other attendees. One such proposal, the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, aims to link neighborhood transformation with school reform and calls for increased federal housing spending during the 2010 fiscal year.
“The correlation between [housing and education] is not just theory—it’s practice,” Donovan said. “It’s time to bring that practice to scale at the neighborhood level.”
In his speech, Donovan also emphasized the intersection of housing policy with other concerns, like transportation. He cited the dilemma of attempting to reduce carbon emissions while supporting urban growth as one such problem that would benefit from a broader policy analysis.
Audience members expressed support for Donovan’s approach to housing policy in a question-and-answer session following the speech. The audience also gave Donovan standing ovations both before and after his lecture.
“The secretary is sort of the fresh face of HUD,” said Ivan Levi, a second-year student at the Graduate School of Design seeking a master’s degree in urban planning. “To have him at the helm of that agency bodes well for the future of that agency and hopefully for this country.”
Donovan, who also earned graduate degrees in public administration and architecture from Harvard, said that his time in Cambridge helped him understand the connections between housing and other policy concerns.
“It was the bridge between the policy and design that enabled me to see the greater picture,” Donovan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 3, the citizens of Cambridge will go to the polls and elect six members to the new Cambridge Public School Committee. The outcome could significantly change the character of the city’s public schools, which are now perched at a crossroads.
Cambridge Public Schools currently face a daunting array of issues, including a race-based achievement gap, inconsistencies in middle-grade education, a controversial policy to establish socioeconomic diversity, and looming budget concerns.
The roster of candidates includes five current committee members: Alfred B. Fantini, Joseph G. Grassi, Marc C. McGovern, Patricia M. Nolan ’80, and Nancy Tauber. Of the four remaining contenders, two—Richard N. Harding, Jr., and Alice L. Turkel—are former committee members. Charles L. Stead, Sr., and Alan R. Steinert, Jr. ’58 are the only candidates with no past school committee experience.
How and if the district solves its problems will depend on which of these individuals—whose educational philosophies range widely—gets a seat on next year’s school committee.
ACHIEVEMENT
Cambridge’s subpar standardized testing results (LINK), and its subsequent designation as “in need of improvement” by the federal government, have catapulted the issue of student achievement to the forefront of almost every candidate’s platform.
The main concern is the so-called achievement gap, the ever-persistent disparity between test scores of white and minority students—a trend that is reflected across the nation.
In Cambridge, white students consistently outperform minority students on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests. Last year, 62 percent of the district’s white seventh graders, compared to only 18 percent of black seventh graders, scored “proficient” or “advanced” in math. And while 79 percent of white seventh graders scored proficient or advanced in English language arts, only 44 percent of their black counterparts met those standards.
All of the candidates running for office said that they found this disparity completely unacceptable, but only a few have articulated specific plans to rectify the issue.
Nolan, who is currently seeking a third consecutive term on the committee, said she believes that the answer lies in establishing high standards for all students—an approach that McGovern, another current committee member, said he also supports.
“What one means by achievement varies,” Nolan said. “For me it’s making sure we have higher expectations all around. The way for us to make good on our potential as a district is to treat everybody as though they can be high achievers.”
But Stead, a newcomer to school committee politics, said he believes the key to closing the achievement gap is hiring more minority teachers, who could serve as desperately-needed mentors for students of color. Stead, who is black, has worked in the district as a principal and teacher for 34 years and considers himself to be one such role model.
“I have long contended that the city has not done enough to supplement its minority staff teaching,” he said. “I believe sincerely that the increasing of the number of minority staff members would have gone a long way to defeating the gap.”
Turkel, who previously served on the committee from 1996-2003, also advocated for expanding diversity among faculty, but she added that solving the problem of achievement would require schools to implement “a variety of approaches so that all students can access and engage with the curriculum.”
MIDDLE SCHOOLS
The second most frequently mentioned issue in the election has been the quality of the city’s middle grade education—a debate that has divided district leaders for decades.
Because Cambridge has no standalone middle schools, most students attend sixth, seventh, and eighth grades at one of the city’s 11 K-8 schools.
Critics of the current K-8 system contend that educational programs at each school vary in quality, which is in part due to an imbalanced distribution of students across the district.
Parents, teachers, and administrators have complained that the city’s smaller schools—some of which have no more than 50 pupils in a single grade—have created socially isolating environments for students and staffing challenges for faculty.
These issues were formally examined for the first time in the 2007 Blue Ribbon Commission, which called on the superintendent to propose specific solutions to settle the middle school debate.
This process was delayed by the sudden departure of then-Superintendent Thomas D. Fowler-Finn and the school committee’s resolution to table any decision-making about the issue until his successor was selected.
Current Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young, who was elected last spring, had originally committed to presenting concrete proposals to address the concern by October, but he announced last month that this would not be possible. He has since promised to solve the issue once and for all by April 2010, which leaves the fate of Cambridge’s middle school education in the hands of the newly-elected school committee.
Grassi, who co-chaired the Blue Ribbon Commission, said that the middle school debate is “the biggest issue the school committee is going to have over the next term.”
Indeed, all of the other candidates who are currently on the committee said they agree that the problem warrants ongoing discussion.
But Stead, Steinert, and Turkel, none of whom sit on the committee now, said they believe that concern about the middle grades is largely a non-issue.
Turkel said that the established K-8 system “reduces pressure to grow up too soon” and “allows for the continuity of relationships between students and faculty,” as well as “between families and school personnel.”
CONTROLLED CHOICE
Many candidates have also listed Cambridge’s Controlled Choice Policy as one of the primary concerns in their platforms.
Controlled choice, the city’s method of assigning kindergarten students to elementary schools, was initially established to create racially-balanced student populations but was later revised to address socioeconomic diversity.
The program currently allows parents to submit a ranked list of preferred schools but ultimately uses an algorithm to place students according to set demographic ratios.
Many parents have long complained about the policy, pointing out that some families face transportation difficulties—in addition to concerns about maintaining a place in their local community—when they are not assigned to one of their top choice schools.
A few of the candidates have deeper criticisms of the program, contending that controlled choice has largely failed to achieve its fundamental purpose.
“The current controlled choice policy has not desegregated Cambridge elementary schools,” Grassi said. “We have schools that are racially and socio-economically imbalanced far beyond system-wide averages and approved variances within the policy.”
Because Cambridge’s controlled choice system allows students to apply to transfer schools—and because certain schools have special programs that make them disproportionately popular—some classrooms inevitably end up imbalanced. This resulting lack of diversity, Grassi said, is partly to blame for the city-wide achievement gap.
To solve this problem, Nolan has proposed to open up more places at the most sought-after schools and to incorporate “new models for under-chosen schools to attract more families.”
Turkel suggested a similar strategy, emphasizing that “the school system must become more responsive to parent/guardian desires.”
Most of the candidates agreed that the new committee needs to reexamine the entire controlled choice process, including the algorithm itself.
But Fantini, a current committee member, said he believes that the plan can be “sustained” without significant modifications.
BUDGET
Especially in the current economic climate, the district’s budget has  also emerged as a primary area of focus for the prospective school committee members.
Cambridge’s spending per pupil is unusually high, but its standardized testing scores remain low—a contrast that has prompted many of the candidates to question whether the district has been utilizing its resources wisely.
In the 2006-07 school year, Cambridge allotted $24,467 to each student, according to the Massachusetts Department of Education. On average, surrounding districts—such as Boston and Newton—spent about $10,000 less per student.
Tauber, who co-chaired the district’s budget committee last year, said that she believes this spending needs extensive review.
“We need to formally evaluate our programs to determine their continued funding,” she said.
Harding, who could not be reached for comment, wrote on his Web site that the district needs to reallocate its funding to improve math and science programs at all levels.
Due to the ongoing financial crisis, careful review of the budget will be crucial in the coming years. Last spring, the district was forced to resolve a $2 million deficit for the 2009-10 school year by reducing and allocating spending in a variety of areas.
Some of the candidates also stressed the importance of increasing the transparency of the schools’ budget process, arguing that the residents of Cambridge deserve to know how their money is being spent.
“Six years ago, no one could tell you where all the money was going,” said McGovern, who has since worked with Nolan to create the first “Citizen’s Guide to the Budget,” a booklet that outlined the district’s fiscal situation using laymen’s terms. Both McGovern and Nolan said they will remain committed to informing the public about financial developments within the city’s public schools.
Turkel also said she believes that increasing school and community involvement is a key part of in solving budget problems.
“Principals, school staff, teachers, and parents/guardians can work together to create the best learning environments for their student population,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say offense sells tickets and defense wins games. Co-captain Kathryn Farni has always helped the Harvard women’s ice hockey team win games, but judging by her performance against McGill on Saturday, she’ll sell some tickets this season too.
Farni scored the Crimson’s first goal before assisting on its final three in the team’s 4-1 defeat of the Martlets in an exhibition game at Bright Hockey Center.
Five minutes into the game, Farni took advantage of a shorthanded opportunity.
A McGill player was going for a long pass, but Farni read the play and intercepted the puck in the neutral zone, scoring on a breakaway.
“She has great anticipation and timing,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She can be a strong threat offensively.”
Farni found the back of the net just that once, but was the catalyst for the Crimson’s remaining goals.
“The way she contributed to the following three goals was by creating and developing,” senior goaltender Christina Kessler said. “She was there in times where we needed her.”
Had the game been official, it would have been Farni’s career high in points, but those who have known the defenseman throughout her playing career say she has always had these abilities.
“She was always good,” remembered junior forward Katharine Chute, who had played on spring league teams with Farni.
“She always had really good hands, always had a really good stick.”
It’s not surprising that Farni was drawn to hockey. In Minnesota, the land of 10,000 frozen lakes, it’s a way of life.
“[Playing in Minnesota] is definitely a lot of fun,” Farni reminisced. “There are so many good players that come out of the state.”
Earning two all-state team selections, the Crimson’s co-captain was one of the best.
But she earned her reputation in high school mainly as a forward. The Minnetonka native graduated from the Hopkins School as its all-time career leading scorer, though that mark was passed last year. But Hopkins coach Vin Paolucci anticipated Farni’s move to defense in college, and made the switch her senior year.
“She has a lot of skills on the blue line,” Paolucci said.
“Her hockey IQ is one of her best attributes. She knows the game really well. The reason we moved her back is because I thought she’d be a good college defenseman.”
And through hard work, she has become just that.
“She worked as hard as anyone we’ve ever had,” Paolucci said. “And she’s continued to work hard, which is one of the things I’m most proud of. When she comes home in the summer, she works incredibly hard.”
Heading into this season, the Crimson will rely heavily on an experienced defensive unit led by Farni, co-captain Cori Bassett, and Kessler.
“You hope to be leading by example,” Farni said. “You hope to be someone who is a contributing member, supportive off the ice, and with a young team, you really want freshmen to be comfortable. [The captains are] making a really big effort to make sure everyone feels on the same page, really comfortable so we can hit the ground running.”
For all her accomplishments and leadership credentials, Farni remains humble and soft-spoken.
“She’s a great kid,” Stone said. “Her teammates love her...she’s got a strong work ethic and leads by example. Nothing flashy, nothing cocky, she just does her job.”
“She’s highly competitive,” Paolucci added. “She may be a little on the quiet side, but don’t let that fool you...She has that fire inside of her that burns...She’s one of the most competitive kids we’ve ever had and one of the most competitive people I’ve ever known.”
The Crimson hopes that drive will help take it to the top. For now, Farni remains grounded, focusing on the importance of the work ahead.
“With it being an Olympic year, you kind of don’t know what to expect,” she said. “So we’re going to focus on our effort, make sure we outwork every team we play.”
It is that desire to outwork everyone that has earned Farni respect wherever she goes. Though her high school scoring mark no longer stands, her legacy at Hopkins remains untouched, and the current team keeps track of her college career.
“I watch every game,” Paolucci said.
When the Crimson played in the NCAA Tournament in Wisconsin in 2007, Paolucci and the Hopkins girls rented a bus to go out to watch her.
“She’s just been a great role model,” Paolucci said. “Our girls at the high school team are really proud of her. As a coach, you can’t ask for anything more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team sent seven players to compete in the ITA East Regional this weekend, but only one player remains in the draw.
Sophomore Holly Cao is currently in the semifinal of the tournament hosted by Yale and will finish play today.
“I think every time Holly’s on the tennis court, she’s a force to be reckoned with,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “All her opponents are strong, but she’s found a way to come through.”
Cao, the tournament’s two-seed, is 4-0 in singles action during the four-day event.
She won her first three matches easily in straight sets against opponents from Yale, Brown, and Boston College. In the quarterfinals, Cao faced off against Jessie Rhee of Yale and emerged with a 7-6, 6-4 victory. She will play Melissa Saiontz of Princeton tomorrow in the semifinal match.
“I think I’ve been playing well,” Cao said. “This is my first tournament indoors so it’s always a slight adjustment. I’m pleased with the way I’m playing. It’s been straight sets, but they’ve been tough matches.”
Cao also had a solid showing in doubles, advancing the quarterfinals with her partner, freshman Kristin Norton. The pair went 3-1 on the weekend, winning its first three matches 8-3, 8-5, and 9-7. In its next match, the fifth-seeded tandem matched up against the three-seed, Molly Scott and Mary Beth Winingham from Dartmouth. The Big Green team downed Cao and Norton, 9-7.
In other doubles action, junior captain Samantha Rosekrans paired up with freshman Hideko Tachibana.
The two posted 8-3 and 8-5 wins, but lost to the top-seeded team of Hilary Bartlett and Taylor Marable from Princeton.
“I think we had a really good showing,” Green said. “[Our doubles play] improved tremendously in the last month and a half.”
Cao, Norton, Tachibana, and freshman Sophie Chang were all seeded in this weekend’s singles tournament.
In a tough first-round match, Chang squeaked out a three-set victory to set up a face off against top-seed Molly Scott of Dartmouth in the next round. In that match, Chang steamrolled Scott, winning 6-1, 6-4. But the freshman met her demise in the next round when she fell to the nine-seed, Casey Herzberg of Brown, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
“Sophie had a great weekend,” Green said. “[She] kept her composure which was very critical. She kept her focus and at the right moments she went for some big shots and came through.”
Norton also had a strong weekend as the 13th-seed. She won her first match with conviction, and then faced two three-set battles. She edged an opponent from Dartmouth 6-7, 6-3, 6-1, and then took down the six-seed, Vicky Brook of Yale, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. In the quarterfinals, a tired Norton could not put up a big enough challenge, and she dropped the match 6-3, 6-1.
“Both [Chang and Norton] have been playing extremely well all week,” Cao said. “[Norton] had a couple three setters in the singles and that sort of took a toll on her. They stepped up to the occasion.”
Unseeded Harvard players, freshman Alexandra Lehman and Rosekrans, fell in the first and second round, respectively.
Tachibana, who has been undefeated in singles this preseason and has won multiple tournaments, finally met her match this weekend. The three-seed cruised past her first two opponents, but fell emphatically to Magdalena Ploch of UMass, 6-2, 6-2.
“It was just bound to happen,” Green said on Tachibana’s first loss. “She’s had an excellent fall so far. She had a really good doubles weekend as well.”
The indoor regional tournament is one of the more important competitions of the fall season. According to Green, the success of her young players was impressive.
“I thought the overall results were very solid,” Green said. “Our team being so young, we really showed a lot of promise this weekend.”
Cao takes the court today at 10:30 a.m. for her semifinal match, and then will play in the finals this afternoon pending the result of her first match.
“I’m going into the match focusing on my game and trying to do my best,” Cao said. “I’m hoping to win tomorrow, obviously. A more important thing though is to improve with each match. That’s the main goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson sailing team continued its busy fall schedule with four regattas throughout New England this past weekend.
While the co-ed squad was split between three regattas over the two days, the women’s team competed at just one regatta, the Women’s Stu Nelson Trophy, and brought home Harvard’s best result of the weekend, a runner-up team finish.
The co-ed squad did not fare quite as well as its all-female counterpart, as the top group from the co-ed team placed ninth at the Sherman Hoyt Trophy, while other co-ed contingents managed an 11th place effort at the Oberg Trophy and a 10th place showing at the Central Series Six regatta.
“We all know our roles and all want to represent the team well in our regattas,” freshman skipper Ryan Byrne said. “We focus on whatever event we are competing in and try to perform as well as possible.”
WOMEN’S STU NELSON TROPHY
The highlight of the weekend for the Crimson was the women’s team second-place finish at the Women’s Stu Nelson Trophy regatta, which took place at Connecticut College. The runner-up effort matched the highest finish Harvard has earned this fall season.
“We are really happy with our performance this weekend,” women’s captain Liz Powers said. “The conditions we faced were different than usual, as we were sailing in a river that went out to the ocean. We therefore had to deal with currents, and a lot of strategy was used to determine how best to sail in the current while dealing with the shifty winds.”
The Crimson was led by its B-division pairing of Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel, who placed first overall in the division and won six of its 14 races on the weekend.
Sophomore skipper Emily Lambert and fellow second-year crew Alex Jumper took care of the A-division racing. While the duo struggled early on in the competition on Saturday, leaving Harvard in seventh place as a team after day one, the pair of sophomores rebounded nicely on Sunday to finish seventh in its division and earn one race victory on the weekend.
“We were able to adapt to the added factor of the current and perform well,” Powers said. “We also were able to compete well at a competitive regatta with teams that traveled from up and down the East Coast, so we were definitely pleased with our performance and hope to keep it up at next weekend’s Atlantic Coast Championship qualifier.”
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
The Crimson’s top co-ed sailors traveled to Brown University to compete at the Sherman Hoyt Trophy regatta and brought home a ninth place team finish among 18 schools.
Junior captain skipper Alan Palmer led Harvard’s efforts with a fifth place showing in the A-division, where the crewing duties were shared among senior Winston Yan, junior Grace Charles and senior Michelle Konstadt.
The same trio crewed the B-division boat, where sophomore Brendan Kopp handled the skippering duties in a 14th place finish.
OBERG TROPHY
Another contingent of co-ed sailors made the short trip down the banks of the Charles River to compete at the Oberg Trophy regatta at MIT. The squad competed in three divisions on the weekend and finished 11th out of 17 schools.
Racing was canceled on the first day of competition, and one of Harvard’s crews suffered an injury, which further set back the Crimson as it competed against the challenging conditions on Sunday.
“Some of the top competition from throughout the region was there,” Byrne said.
“We competed well but the wind was tricky out there on the Charles.”
Junior Teddy Himler handled the skippering duties in the A-division boat, where he was joined by sophomore crew Annie DeAngelo in a fifth place finish.
In the B-division, junior skipper Colin Santangelo and freshman crew Sarah McCuskee placed 14th, while Byrne and fellow rookie crew Alma Lafler took home 12th in the C-division.
CENTRAL SERIES SIX
A final contingent of Crimson co-ed sailors made its way to Boston College to compete in the Central Series Six regatta over the weekend, finishing with a 10th place effort.
First-years skipper Sam Millham and crew Jinyan Zang finished 10th in the A-division of racing, while fellow rookies skipper Nick Waldo and crew Lauren Tiedemann placed eighth in the B-division.
Three weeks remain in Harvard’s fall sailing campaign, and the Crimson will look to finish up the fall season strong to gain momentum for the championship regattas come the spring.
“We have been progressing all season,” Powers said, “and will continue to push ourselves to remain focused and preserve through our remaining regattas this fall.”

Quidditch may not be the same without flying broomsticks, but there's still no lack of competition for the newly formed Harvard Quidditch team.
For the first time ever, the Quidditch team undertook a grueling 4 hour journey to compete in the Intercollegiate Quidditch World Cup at Middlebury College, in a quest for glory, thrills, and a chance to emerge victorious in yet another contest against that college in New Haven. Twelve valiant competitors, an assorted crew including a member of the varsity track team and all diehard Harry Potter fans, boarded a bus in the predawn hours yesterday morning to face off against some of the most experienced college Quidditch teams across the country, running across grassy fields with brooms between their legs.
But when the Harvard team arrived, beating Yale was a simple matter of showing up—which the Yale team didn't manage to do, thereby forfeiting the match.
"Yale is clearly scared of us," said Quidditch co-captain Stacy L. Rush, a visiting student from Toronto.
Read more about the blood, guts, and glory of the Intercollegiate Quidditch World Cup after the jump.
Harvard's other matches against BU, Emerson, and UMass Amherst proceeded less smoothly. In the words of Rush, "we were pulverized in the first one, beaten in the second one, and almost won the third one." Rush said that Harvard had been leading 30-10, but the appearance and capture of the Snitch was a game-changer, resulting in a 30-40 scoreboard (doesn't that sound suspiciously like Harry Potter's uncanny ability to save his team heroically, in just about every match?).
The injury rate among hard-tackling Quidditch players adds another touch of realism. Several players on other teams broke bones, including a collarbone, said co-captain Alana J. Biden '11.
"You're allowed to do anything but pull hair," Biden said. But for the casualties, too bad there's no such thing as magical healing (a flick of a wand, a swig of potion, and Harry's always good to go).
As a relatively new team organized only two weeks ago, Harvard has a long way to go compared to eventual World Cup winners Middlebury—who founded the Intercollegiate Quidditch Association and who has won the World Cup every year since the first tournament in 2005. But according to Rush, the Harvard team has significant potential for improvement, given the natural athleticism of its members.
"We just have to get our game together and work out strategies," she said.

What's going to school in big, bad Cambridge like without a couple of bomb scares once in a while? No big deal, right? Just another night where a bunch of fire engines are blaring their sirens and flashing their lights...in the Quad?! The relative tranquility usually experienced by Quadlings was disrupted this evening when the commotion caused by the fire department led many to think there was a bomb threat in the surrounding area.
Find out what it was after the jump!
Turns out, the Cambridge Fire Department and bomb squad were merely responding to a call from an elderly couple...trying to get rid of a cannonball. We know, right? The surprises just keep coming. The couple had, for many years, used said cannonball as a doorstop in their home, but on this fateful evening of October 26, 2009, they decided it was finally time to let go of their beloved iron friend.
So a worried neighbor called the fire department who called the bomb squad, and the cannonball has since been carried off to be disposed of safely.
Oh, Quad Life.

FlyBy's been following the poisoning incident at Harvard Medical School that we told you about yesterday morning where six researchers went to the hospital after drinking coffee contaminated with a potentially deadly agent found in many biochemical labs called sodium azide.
Well, it turns out one of the victims has come out and accused somebody, somewhere of having put the chemical in the coffee machine on purpose. Matteo Iannacone, a graduate of an Italian medical school and research associate at the HMS' Pathology Department, told the Associated Press yesterday that he doesn't believe that it was chance that his coffee contained more than just caffeine:
...
"I have no idea who might have done this thing," he said. "To me it doesn't look like a joke, obviously, because we were not far from a lethal dose."
Officials and administrators at HMS wouldn't deny the charge. HMS spokesman David J. Cameron told The Crimson two nights ago that investigators hadn't eliminated any theory as to how the sodium azide got in the coffee machine, and Mabel P. Duyao, director of research at the Pathology Department, left the door open whether the presence of the chemical was due to malice.
There's more to the story. Read about it after the jump.
The A.P. also reported that after experiencing symptoms of dizziness and increased heart rate, Iannacone was taken to Brigham and Women's Hospital, but an internal HMS memo released Friday stated that all six victims were seen at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
And so, the mystery continues.

This week's FM scrutiny takes a look at professional poker players. Take, for example, "Darkhawk-2000." It's the online moniker used by one Harvard student who frequents online poker tables. Darkhawk, as he requested to be named, once lost $8,000 in one sitting. But he's had good streaks, too—a grand-prize package that included partying with Charles Barkley and, not to mention, about $80,000 in profits over the past year. You see, Darkhawk is a professional poker player. He's out to win big, and win hard.
And he's not alone. Gambling is a known phenomenon, but professional gambling? That's a whole different story. Find out more about these professionals, including acclaimed player Matt Hawrilenko, and how they manage to get on the good side of luck.

The University has its own Facebook fan page, Twitter feed, and publication that's now updated online daily. But it isn't the only Harvard institution looking to release news on its own platform.
The Undergraduate Council launched the blog "The UC Juicy" yesterday, which will try to give students more of a sense of what the UC does. Though the UC had a blog on its official Web site for the past two years, no one read it. UC President Andrea R. Flores '10 explained that having a blog on a separate platform hopefully will make the blog more accessible than the previous one, which she admitted that "nobody updated" (except for Student Relations committee chair Daniel V. Kroop '10, occasionally).
Flores said she hopes that the blog, which is being led by the Student Relations Committee, will be "more personalized" than its predecessor. In addition to previews and summaries of UC meetings, it will include profiles of UC members and "joke posts" about Flores' love of lolcats.
As of now, the blog still is an embryo, commemorating the death of Geocities and boasting pretty Harvard pictures. Its most popular tags are "J-Term" and "the internet"—a bit reminiscent of the comatose GossipGeek, which featured animated gifs and other older internet throwbacks.
More "Juicy" info—including the coming launch of "UC TV"—after the jump.
The UC already has its own Twitter feed (with 49 followers, making it 188 percent more popular than Harvard's Gen Ed Twitter feed) and is soon launching its own Facebook fan page. But in a few weeks, it will launch its boldest foray into the media yet: "UC TV" via HUTV, featuring broadcasts of UC meetings and interviews with UC members, according to Flores.
Flores said that since UC meetings this year will be dealing with budget cuts, it will be more important than usual "to make us more transparent and visible to students."
"Instead of waiting for that one Crimson article that summarizes everything, I want people to know that this a process; advocacy does take time," Flores said. "The UC is not just for people who want to play politics. It's people who work very hard...We don't just go to sleep until the presidential election and then talk about the issues."
But rather than just build a wall of good news, Flores said that she's aiming for the blog and other online outlets to increase the UC's transparency and accountability.
Though the UC presidential election looms just a couple of weeks away, Flores emphasized that the blog will not discuss the elections—though she said she's planning to announce on the blog that she's holding office hours today for anyone interested in running for president.
The UC is hosting a Halloween-themed launch party for the blog on Friday at 4-5:30 p.m. in Ticknor Lounge. The raffle includes a date with Andrea.
