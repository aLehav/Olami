After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, President Obama did one of the most courageous things I have ever seen a president do; on the eve of a hotly contested election to be decided by a few swing states, he declared his personal support for gay marriage. But for me, this announcement was the logical conclusion not to Vice President Biden’s admirable if imprudent admission on Sunday, but to the letters and journals that have emerged in the past two weeks that have given extraordinary insight into the man who candidly spoke to ABC this week.
David Maraniss is a very good biographer, so it should come as no surprise that he has dug up some fascinating material about President Obama for his upcoming book Barack Obama: The Story, excerpted in the June edition of Vanity Fair. The article, entitled “Becoming Obama,” treats what has been a hitherto overlooked interval in the lifeof the forty-second President, his time in New York after graduating from Columbia in 1983.Maraniss’s descriptions are both intimate, giving us an Obama who would “lounge around, drinking coffee and solving the New York Timescrossword puzzle, bare-chested, wearing a blue and white sarong,” and relatively profound, as when Obama explains in an interview “The only way my life makes sense is if, regardless of culture, race, religion, tribe, there is this commonality…So that is at the core of who I am.” In some ways, Obama’s attempt to turn his life into a story, best exemplified in his superb autobiography Dreams from My Father, is part of the job of all aspirants to high office.Every politician strives to create a narrative that explains their rise to prominence and fills out their character in such a way that the office they seek to occupy seems like an inevitable next step, something that follows consequently from the trajectory that brought them before the electorate.
But the Obama we meet in Maraniss’s account is someone much different, and much more interesting; the protagonist of a real bildungsromanwho struggles to define himself, both in isolation and in relation to his white girlfriends, Pakistani friends, and multi-textured familial background. Obama describes his predicament as one where he felt “caught without a class, a structure or tradition to support me.” These lacunae where we might expect to find the primary markers of identity spurred not alienation, but an intense search for integration, “The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions (and) classes; make them mine, me theirs.” Before he could organize communities, Obama had to organize the confusing fragments of identity that were his inheritance, but also his opportunity. The young man we see in these pages doesn’t have any definitive answers, but his awareness of the centrality of this task of self-fashioning is boldly apparent.
His letters to one of his girlfriends Alex McNair, and the journals of a second, Genevieve Cook, portray a man who, even when he “sat on the edge of the bed—dressed— blue jeans and luscious ladies on his chest, the end of the front section of the Sunday Times in his hand,” is readily recognizable. Cook laments how Obama “bides his time” and draws “others’ cards out of their hands for careful inspection—without giving too much of your own away.” This might be a young man who kept a cool distance that his girlfriend found frustrating, but it also might be the President Obama who passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with the slimmest of votes or who continues to teach us about a kind of progressivism that happens slowly—but meaningfully and irrevocably.
Maraniss describes a young man searching for purpose, pontificating on Modernist poetics and falling in and out of love with a couple of thoughtful, beautiful young women. His analysis of T.S. Eliot is both insightful and revealing; “Remember how I said there’s a certain type of conservatism which I respect more than bourgeois liberalism—Eliot is of this type.” What is striking about these snippets of the young Obama is how prosaic they are on the one hand and how utterly revealing on the other. Obama continues to model a kind of liberalism that is temperamentally conservative, that sees change as most effective when it is processed through a mind that can capaciously not only understand the other side, but alsoinhabit opposing view points.
In an editorial in The New York Times, the poet and literary critic Adam Kirsch ‘97 lauds “Mr. Obama’s ability to recognize the poetic truth of Eliot’s conservatism, while still embracing the practical truth of liberalism.” Both recognition and embrace happened in and through writing, and much of it in the crucible of passionate romantic relationships that refracted both selves through a kind of dual lens. Obama teaches us to recognize everything about ourselves and other people, and through that recognition we will learn which causes and people deserve our embrace. As we recognize the extraordinary man who is our President, we should never forget when he was our age, in his girlfriend’s apartment, smoking a cigarette in pajamas, musing on Eliot. This, more than anything else, is the portrait of the President as a young man.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is mostly about national politics and that my coursework tends more toward abstract issues in moral philosophy—the two do not tend to intersect often. So much so, in fact, that the philosopher with whom I most consistently agree—the 19th century Cambridge utilitarian Henry Sidgwick—held views on real-life politics that bordered on the repugnant. He, in sharp contrast to previous utilitarians, was deeply skeptical of large-scale political and economic reforms, and argued that adherence with Victorian social mores was required by the principle of utility. He even once attended a lecture on land reform by the socialist playwright George Bernard Shaw and, after Shaw finished speaking, rose to respond, stated that Shaw “advocated nationalization of land; that nationalization of land was a crime; and that he [Sidgwick] would not take part in a discussion of a criminal proposal,” and sat right back down again.
But Sidgwick also wrote brilliantly and rigorously about moral philosophy, and in particular about one specific problem that has come to mind often as I consider, two weeks before graduation, what Harvard has come to mean to me. Sidgwick once jokingly noted that he had written a book where the first word was “ethics” and the last word was “failure.” What he was referring to was his conclusion to The Methods of Ethics: that there was no way to prove that one should act a utilitarian (that is, on behalf of the well-being of all) rather than as an egoist (on the behalf of only one’s own well-being). They both appeared to be rational positions, and Sidgwick could not for the life of him prove that one has more reason to be a utilitarian than an egoist.
For most people living in England at Sidgwick’s time, this did not present much of a problem at all. If one believes traditional Christian tenets, then those who act virtuously, or on behalf of the good of all, are rewarded for their efforts with eternal bliss in heaven. Those who fail in these duties are punished with eternal torment in hell. Thus, it is clearly in each person’s self-interest to behave virtuously, for the good of an eternity in heaven (and avoiding an eternity in hell) will always outweigh whatever benefit acting selfishly and against the common good provides in this life. The utilitarian and the egoist thus must act identically.
But as he was writing the Methods, Sidgwick lost his faith in God, even going so far as to resign a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge because its terms required assent to the teachings of the Church of England. And with his faith, Sidgwick lost the best way to reconcile egoism and utilitarianism, to show that one must always act for the sake of the common welfare. The possibility that the two might conflict was what Sidgwick called the “profoundest problem in ethics”.
I am more optimistic than Sidgwick was about the prospects for demonstrating the superiority of benevolence to egoism. But what he got absolutely right was the fact that we yearn for a theory, like Christian theism, that says they are one and the same. What worries me is that I think Harvard students have convinced ourselves that we have such a theory, one that exculpates us from sacrifice while leaving us convinced that we are doing the right thing. We call it “meritocracy.”
It allows us to say that Harvard should lay off workers at will because the purpose of a place like this is to educate people like us, not to help people like “them.” Or maybe we should pay them well, but only so we get better food in the dining halls. It allows us to say that there’s nothing wrong with taking banking jobs after graduation, that we’re doing it because the financial industry helps people, not because we like money. It lets us justify the fact that we go to a school with more resources than any other and yet educates a small student body whose natural endowments mean they need those resources less than practically anybody. It lets us say that the rule of the smart and well-credentialed helps everyone, that it’s not just another caste system.
I love Harvard. I have loved my education here, I loved the clubs I joined, and I love the friends I made. But the system that makes this place so great for people like me—people like us—does so on the backs of many, many others. The money that makes Harvard so incredible could be educating countless more people if sent elsewhere. The administration’s remarkable avoidance of substantial cutbacks to student life since the financial crisis was enabled by mass layoffs. The endowment is as big as it is in large part due to alumni who go to jobs contributing to financial crises at banks and hedge funds. None of that is acceptable.
Of course, everyone believes convenient things, as psychologists who study confirmation bias will tell you, and Harvard students’ commitment to meritocracy’s all too self-serving tenets is hardly unusual. But my main wish as I leave here is for a greater recognition of what a problem this is and a greater degree of Sidgwickian doubt about whether our interests and the world’s can be reconciled. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe they can be. But we need to be asking the question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since President Obama first rose to national prominence, his tepid advocacy for gay rights and avowed—if unconvincing—opposition to gay marriage stood as a monument to the evils of political posturing. Here was a candidate who appeared to share the same liberal social and cultural values as the young voters he so effortlessly enraptured. His own struggle with identity and deliberately cosmopolitan outlook seemed to suggest a man whose vision was unclouded by the baseless, putatively religious aversion to homosexuality that still informed the views of so many politicians. All this, in addition to the president’s 1996 statement in support of same-sex marriage, made his supposed opposition to marriage equality seem perplexing at best and deliberately deceptive at worst.
It seemed clear enough that President Obama was obfuscating his position in order to hold together a fragile political coalition that included important groups who have never shared young voters’ support for gay rights. It was realpolitik, and it was a bitter pill to swallow—but we swallowed it.
This week, however, everything changed. On Sunday, Vice President Joe Biden—either getting “over his skis”, or deliberately testing the water for the administration—broke with official policy and endorsed gay marriage. The next day, Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86came out in favor of marriage equality. Then, on Tuesday, North Carolina passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages as well as civil unions. Suddenly, President Obama’s dissimulation on marriage equality seemed both absurd and harmful. No doubt knowing he could delay the issue no longer, President Obama arranged an interview on ABC in which he affirmed his support for same-sex marriage.
Although it is terribly unfortunate that the president ever chose to feign opposition to marriage equality, it is nevertheless extremely heartening that, as of Wednesday, the president of the United States of America, for the first time in history, supports true equality for gay Americans. This also provides voters with a starker choice in November’s election, considering that Mitt Romney has reaffirmed his opposition to same-sex marriage and allegedly bullieda classmate, whom he suspected of being gay, in high school.
Despite occasional setbacks like what occurred in North Carolina on Tuesday, it is clear that the direction of cultural shift is toward marriage equality in America. The most recent Gallup poll on the subject shows that seventy percent of 18-34 year-olds think gay marriage should be legal, while fifty-three percent of 35-54 year olds support marriage equality as well. These numbers are growing and ought to give hope and comfort to all those who care about equality for all. Now that we have a president who supports marriage equality, it is just a matter of time before the winds of change overcome the inertia of baseless stigma and irrational hatred.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was twelve years old, I developed a crush on a boy who was in a number of my classes.
At the time, I was a sixth-grader in the Deep South whose family had recently moved across the county into a new school district.  It felt like we had moved across the country.  At the smaller elementary school I had left, Umbro and Nike shorts were popular, but in this new junior high school, khaki shorts, Birkenstocks, and polo shirts were prerequisites for coolness.  The boy I noticed fit this fashion to a T.
I believed without reservation the crush I was developing was wrong.  I loved church, and I had an understanding that, if you were a boy, liking other boys was a very bad thing to do.  I had no doubt that I was in the wrong, and I prayed every night—literally—that the feelings would go away.  And, eventually, they did.  I breathed a deep sigh of relief.  I felt as if I’d dodged a bullet, with God’s help.  From that point, I went on having crushes on girls as I had until that point, and I’ve gone on having crushes on girls since.
But many other kids weren’t so lucky. Their “illicit” crushes kept on coming. Several kids in my school endured years of bullying and teasing because they were gay or appeared to be gay, and many times I stood idly by, doing nothing to stop it. Even today, their faces, usually with angry expressions, come to my mind. Back then, I believed homosexuality was a sin, but I also knew it was wrong for kids to be bullied like they were. I remember thinking that the bullying, as terrible as it was, was an unfortunate result of sinful behavior, equating it with the Fall of Man since the Garden of Eden. And, after all, I thought, if I’d prayed and gotten over my crush, why couldn’t they?
Several years later, when I visited Harvard for the first time, my views on the matter were “evolving.”  It was a sunny spring day in 2004, and I was dragging around my mother and grandmother, along with all our heavy suitcases and Southern accents. The first thing I saw when I came up out of the Red Line at Johnston Gate was a huge, white banner across the street, hanging from the edifice of First Parish Cambridge. It read, in all capitals, “WE SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE.” The banner blew in the breeze, and the sunlight brightened it so one needed to squint to see it.
I was stunned to see this banner, and, somewhat to my surprise, I was also overjoyed. It had been one thing in the past to observe gay pride parades in all of their dramatic and colorful energy; it was quite another to see this declarative, bold statement draped from a church building, in the public square, in plain view.
I was a high schooler, and this very issue had been weighing on my mind for some time. I was reading a book by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, who was Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Minister of the Memorial Church until his passing last spring. The book, called “The Good Book,” recounts in part Rev. Gomes’ experience revealing himself in 1991 to be what many have called a contradiction: a gay, African American, Baptist minister. He had become minister in 1974, and his book was in my backpack that day thirty years later. The banner at the First Parish Church filled me with sheer joy that something good was happening, something I could not have imagined just a few years back when the thought I might be gay was terrifying to me.
Politically, the particulars of my views on the issue have continued to “evolve” since then: Ideally, I think only civil unions should be granted by the government while churches take care of the “marriages”; I think the “defense of marriage” advocates are right when they say marriage is traditionally a religious institution between one man and one woman; I think churches should handle explicitly religious institutions, while the state grants contracts that guarantee hospital visits, joint taxes, etc.
But it was not until Wednesday, when President Barack Obama became the first sitting President of the United States to express full support for same-sex marriage, that I felt again that same stunned joy I’d felt back in 2004. Obama’s unprecedented announcement is an unequivocal victory for civil rights and equality, and I believe fewer kids will be bullied and teased because of it.
I don’t know whether Obama and Gomes crossed paths when they were at Harvard in the early 1990s. ButI wish Gomes were still here with us today to offer his thoughts on Obama’s newfound support for gay marriage. When I first heard the news, I could hear Rev. Gomes’ voice begin to echo in my head. In his old Religion 42 course, Rev. Gomes once said, “There are no bad questions. There are some very bad answers.” Of Obama’s reply to the ABC News interviewer’s question on Wednesday, I believe Gomes would have raised his eyebrows in restrained surprised, nodded his head, and called it, in his beautiful manner of speaking, a very good answer.

As Harvard’s peer institutions move to update their sexual misconduct policies by lowering the standard of evidence required for a guilty conviction, two lawyers interviewed for this article say that these universities’ changes may encourage Harvard to follow suit.
The University is currently in the midst of a two-year process of reviewing its sexual assault policies to ensure that it is compliant with federal anti-discrimination law.
In April 2011, the Office for Civil Rights released a “Dear Colleague” letter outlining stricter guidelines for colleges and universities for dealing with sexual assault complaints in the wake of a stream of Title IX complaints filed against institutions of higher education, including Harvard Law School.
Last month, both the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell announced that they would modify their sexual assault policies, joining Yale and Stanford in altering their standards in response to the letter. Both the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell adopted the lower standard of “preponderance of the evidence” mandated by the “Dear Colleague” letter, which allows an accused student to be found guilty if the institution is at least 51 percent certain of his or her responsibility for an alleged incident. Previously, some institutions, including Harvard Law School and Princeton, had used a higher “burden of proof” standard, which required “clear and convincing” evidence of the accused student’s guilt.
Peter F. Lake ‘81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said he thinks that Harvard could be influenced by the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell to conform to the “Dear Colleague” letter.
“As schools choose to come into compliance, it does build momentum for similar schools to take similar action,” Lake said.
New England School of Law Professor Wendy Murphy, who filed a 2002 Title IX complaint against the College and the 2010 complaint against the Law School, said she thought that the growing trend among institutions to adopt the “preponderance of evidence” standard have made it increasingly “embarrassing” for any school, including Harvard, to hold out.
Currently, Harvard’s investigation system for sexual assault varies across the University.
While the Faculty of Arts and Sciences requires that the Administrative Board be “sufficiently persuaded” of the accused student’s guilt to issue a guilty verdict, the Law School uses the “burden of proof” standard.
Lake said that although he thinks the “Dear Colleague” letter prescribes “a monotheistic universe,” mandating a single set of values for all institutions of higher education, he does see room in the federal guidelines for Harvard to maintain different policies across its schools as long as the University can prove that a central source is coordinating the different processes.
But Murphy said she thinks Harvard must uniformly adopt a “preponderance of the evidence” standard in order to come into compliance with the federal guidelines.
“Under the tougher standard, schools have their cake and get to eat it too,” said Murphy, who said she thought it was “very heartening” to see the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell change their sexual assault policies.
But Murphy said she thought the Law School’s “burden of proof” standard sends a message to students making an accusation of sexual assault that “‘we do believe you­—we just don’t believe you that much.’”
Two years ago, Harvard began collecting information to assess how well its sexual assault investigation processes and other University policies adhered to federal Title IX regulations, which require colleges and universities to take “immediate and appropriate steps” in response to a sexual misconduct grievance. Last fall, Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman told The Crimson that the University was approaching its review process with an eye toward collecting data and developing programs, rather than revising its sexual assault investigation policies. Although the University had at one point planned to involve a student committee in the review process, the creation of that committee was indefinitely postponed last October.
Lake said that the release of the “Dear Colleague” letter sparked a flurry of changes among many institutions, who swiftly revised their policies in accordance with the new Title IX regulations.
“Certainly schools felt a tremendous pressure to scramble as quickly as they could to figure out how to come into compliance,” Lake said.
Lake said he anticipates a legal battle about the constitutionality of the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, which he thinks may violate accused students’ constitutional right of due process.
Lake added that he thinks the “Dear Colleague” letter puts institutions like Harvard in a difficult position.
Colleges and universities must face the question: “’Do I hold out and violate a federal mandate and face sanctions, or do I potentially violate the due process rights of students?’” Lake said. “That’s a heck of a choice.”

Physicians looking to make surgeries safer took some cutting-edge questions in medical device design to a group of Harvard students, who presented their attempts at solutions this week.
The undergraduate and graduate students of Engineering Sciences 227 displayed their designs—some intended to solve problems that have previously confounded researchers worldwide—to surgeons and engineers at a fair on Monday.
The course, now in its second year, offered engineering students the opportunity to develop a project with the potential to affect surgical procedures, according to mechanical and biomedical engineering professor Conor J. Walsh, who teaches it.
Students and professors at the fair in Pierce Hall were eager to hear about the new breakthroughs and feats of engineering produced by the class. However, every project was tagged with a confidentiality notice cautioning that specifics of the projects cannot be broadcast.
For some students, the chance to physically manufacture a device after designing it was most rewarding.
"Actually building the device—that was a special experience," said Oliver Schoppe, a visiting student who took the class.
It was a work-intensive experience as well. Qian Wan, a graduate student who was one of Schoppe’s project partners, said, "There was definitely a lot to absorb very quickly."
Graduate student Carlos Pardo added, "This was a crash course in design—in six weeks we needed to have a prototype. However, our professor guided us and cut it into small pieces."
The students worked with physicians who guided their projects and provided frequent access to hospitals and special equipment.
"Students and physicians develop a very close relationship. All of the physicians spend many hours providing the medical background to the students, meeting with them, Skyping with them, and bringing them into the hospital environment," Walsh said.
"All the physicians came with medical needs," said graduate student Kimberly M. Murdaugh ’11.
Murdaugh’s group successfully completed a project that others had failed at before.
According to group member Alexander Isakov ’11, a graduate student, researchers both at MIT and in India had unsucessfully tried their task before they began it.
When asked why their attempt succeeded, William C. Burke ’12 noted that they did not try to build on previous designs or prototypes. "We started from nothing," he said.
Like other engineering classes in the 200s, ES 227 is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.
Such classes traditionally attract more graduate students than undergraduates. ES 227, however, was nearly evenly split.
"This year the class had 16 students with seven undergraduates, which is great to see," Walsh said.

Sixty-five Harvard University Library employees have accepted early retirement packages as part of the Library’s Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program, according to a University spokesperson.
In January, Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton said that the University would seek to reduce the size of its library staff as part of its ongoing library reorganization.
The University has yet to specify its goal for staff reductions.
VERIP offered library employees who are 55 years and older with 10 years of service under their belts a chance to receive benefits and avoid possible layoffs.
Approximately 23 percent of the 280 eligible employees accepted the offer. There are currently 930 full-time employees in the University library system.
Those who accepted the offer will receive six months’ pay, plus two additional weeks’ pay for every year of employment beyond 10 years. An employee cannot receive more than one year’s worth of salary under the package.
A University spokesperson declined Thursday to specify whether or not the Harvard University Library will layoff employees in its attempt to cut down its staff size.
Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy and Shenton praised the departing library staff members in a statement sent to library employees on Tuesday.
“The 65 staff members who will be leaving us are dedicated members of a workforce that supports Harvard’s mission every day. We wish them well as they begin a new phase of life, whether that means starting a new job or planning for retirement,” Shenton and Kennedy wrote.
Administrators have drawn criticism during the transition process for a lack of transparency and a failure of communication. Kennedy and Shenton sought to address these concerns in their statement to staff.
“It is not easy to adapt to working without valued colleagues and familiar faces by our sides,” they wrote. “Please know that as we work through the library transition, we will make every effort to support and keep open the lines of communication with our staff, whose dedication and hard work make Harvard great.”
Shenton and Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I and Part II of this story appeared on May 7 and May 9, 2012.)
Walking past a kindergarten classroom at Fletcher-Maynard Academy, a public primary school in Cambridge’s Area Four district, Superintendent of Schools Jeffrey M. Young and Principal Robin Harris noticed a four-year-old boy sitting on the floor and reading a book upside down.
“It wasn’t atypical in a junior kindergarten class,” Harris says.
Inspired by moments like this, Young and Harris began casually brainstorming ways to improve children’s development before they enter formal schooling. The two toyed with the idea of a project modeled on the Harlem Children’s Zone, a nonprofit organization that has garnered national attention for providing educational resources and other forms of support to low-income families living in Harlem, New York.
Young, Harris, and others on the Cambridge Schools Committee devised “Full Circle,” a proposed initiative to better connect the residents of Area Four—a low-income area where 80 percent of elementacary school students receive free lunches, according to Harris—to the public benefits provided by the city government and local nonprofits.
Full Circle—if it comes to fruiton—will be a culmination of several youth-oriented projects that Cambridge has undertaken in past years. But financing and potential partnerships are still up in the air.
The project, inspired by the work of HCZ founder Geoffrey Canada, a Harvard Graduate School of Education alumnus, marks the next chapter in efforts to improve Cambridge’s public education—a movement that Harvard and its alumni frequently influence.
CIRCLE GAME
Full Circle is envisioned not as a single nonprofit organization like HCZ but as a collaboration between many different entities in Cambridge. Based at Fletcher-Maynard, Full Circle would focus its efforts on the children living in the one-mile radius surrounding the school known as Area Four.
In Area Four, located between Central Square and Kendall Square,  the median family income is $55,857, one of the lowest in the city, according to a report issued this year by the Cambridge Community Development Department.
The initiative plans to capitalize on already-existing Cambridge programming. One of those programs, Baby University, was founded after several Cambridge officials visited the Harlem Children’s Zone a few years ago. The program is loosely based on HCZ’s Baby College, which offers nine-week parenting classes.
Baby University, a 16-week publicly-funded program under the Cambridge Department of Human Services Programs, draws support from collaborations with many Cambridge nonprofits, including the the Phillips Brooks House Association at Harvard.
As the Cambridge Department of Education begins initial preparations for Full Circle, Baby University will be held at Fletcher-Maynard this year for the first time since the program began in 2010. Full Circle will also include Toddler University, an all-day course for parents of children ages three to eight that will kick off in 2013.
Harris has had discussions with other potential collaborators, including the Cambridge Health Alliance, neighborhood clergy and churches, financial institutes, and the Cambridge Police Department.
She hopes that Full Circle, like other Cambridge educational programs, will be able to draw upon Harvard University resources as well.
After talks about the Full Circle initiative became more serious, Young approached Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney, who expressed enthusiasm about the program, Harris says.
Harris also asked Canada for advice on the project when he visited the Ed School last month. Harris says Canada was supportive of the project and urged her to get the partnering agencies in place immediately.
Harris said she hopes to agree with the Ed School on a memorandum of understanding between Harvard and Full Circle at the beginning of the academic year. Citing the preliminary nature of the discussion, Ed School officials declined to comment on Harvard’s involvement.
Though partnerships have yet to be officially tied down, many civic leaders have said they are excited about the Full Circle initiative.
“It’s all supposed to be very intentional work, and it’s a great opportunity to take all these resources that are happening in Cambridge,” says Nancy Tauber, a former School Committee member.
IN THE ZONE
Though Full Circle has generated much enthusiasm in Cambridge, financing for the project has yet to be secured.
According to Lori Likis, chief planning officer for Cambridge public schools, financing for Full Circle will include funds from the Department of Human Services Programs, resources allocated to Cambridge public schools, and other funding put toward the Cambridge Innovation Agenda in the 2013 budget.
Likis says that the initiative has also looked to other sources for financial support.
Full Circle is known among educators and policymakers as a wraparound zone, a city-led initiative that seeks to make social services and support more accessible and foster the creation of educational resources.
Wraparound zones elsewhere have received funding and support from Massachusett’s federally-funded Race to the Top program. However, Cambridge’s Full Circle was not eligible for funding due to restrictions stipulated by the state. Likis and other Full Circle proponents pushed to receive an exception, but it was not granted.
Jesse Dixon, who heads the Massachusetts Department of Education’s Office of District and School Turnaround, says that while the state would consider funding initiatives such as Full Circle, the guidelines regulating Race to the Top funding might confine the project’s development.
Under the initiative, cities must commit $100,000 of their Race to the Top money to the zone and must follow a prescriptive approach for the modeling and implementation of the wraparound zone.
Cambridge’s vision for Full Circle does not fall under these guidelines, according to Dixon.
“[Cambridge has] found their own way of doing this work, which isn’t 100 percent aligned with our vision,” Dixon says.
Nevertheless, those involved in the planning of Full Circle say they will continue to work toward establishing this project.
“We’re eager to get Full Circle up and running, develop the partnerships, assess the effectiveness of that, and then decide whether or not to expand,” Likis says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bioengineering, an academic unit of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is on the table to move to Allston, according to several University officials.
According to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, the Harvard administrators are considering moving portions of bioengineering, a growing sector within SEAS, to its proposed Allston Science Center—which was originally conceptualized as a mecca for stem cell research—upon the site’s completion.
Garber said that University officials have yet to finalize academic planning for Allston.
“We’ll have more to say about our academic direction for the building in June, but among the groups that seem to be particularly promising fits for Allston are bioengineering and stem-cell research,” Garber said.
Kevin Casey, University associate vice president of public affairs and communications, said that Harvard is carefully considering its options for Allston development.
“For each area, the provost has been meeting extensively with faculty and deans to further develop the plans in each area, and with fundraising leadership to determine possible strategies for philanthropic support,” Casey wrote in an email.  “This planning process is ongoing.”
SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray, who also serves as the area dean for bioengineering, declined to comment.
In 2007, the University released its Institutional Master Plan for Allston, which included the creation of a $1 billion science complex in Allston. in Allston. However, development on the Allston Science Complex was halted in 2009 when the financial crisis delivered a significant blow to the University endowment.
In 2011, the University resumed planning for Allston development, including the its science complex—now called the Allston Science Center.
The development of the Allston Science Center is just one piece of the two-phase plan for Allston construction released by University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp.
The plan also includes revitalizing the Barry’s Corner area and site planning for the current Charlesview location.
Many Allston residents have expressed concern about the lack of clarity surrounding the University’s goals for the Allston Science Center, especially in conjunction with the University’s progress in selecting a developer for Barry’s Corner.
Task Force member and resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 also emphasized the importance of the University continuing to move forward.
“My point of view is what goes into the building is pretty much Harvard’s decision,” Whelan said.
“The community’s interest is very much that something happens and happens soon so that we’re not in this kind of static paralysis,” he added.
Casey addressed these concerns, but stressed that the University is determined to complete the building.
“In many of our conversations we’ve heard a considerable amount of frustration about the project delay and the uncertainty about what exactly will be housed in the facility once built,” he said. “That’s understandable.”
“I want it to be clear that this project is a high priority for Harvard, and the focus of considerable ongoing academiand financial planning,” Casey added.
The University has yet to specify a start or completion date for construction on the Allston Science Center, but Casey said that Harvard will release more details on planning in June.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 11, 2012, at 4:28 a.m.
A sandwich stand on Harvard Medical School property that has long been beloved by the Longwood Medical Area community has been threatened with closure if it does not make improvements to meet city codes.
During a routine check in March, Boston inspectors flagged Sami’s Wrap and Roll, a sandwich shop that has done business on Medical School property for 33 years. The City of Boston determined that since the stand is not on wheels, it does not qualify as a portable establishment like a food truck and is instead subject to the codes for permanent structures—meaning it would need plumbing to legally stay open.
“When you have a permanent structure, you must comply with different regulations,” said Lisa M. Timberlake, a spokesperson for Boston Inspectional Services.
Sami’s currently pays rent to Harvard, and Harvard pays the stand’s electricity costs. The University will not install plumbing at Sami’s, according to Richard M. Shea, the associate dean for physical planning and facilities for the Medical School.
The small business was initially given until Friday to stay open unless it made changes but was granted a 30-day extension on Thursday after G. Sami Saba, who owns the stand with his wife Amy, went to City Hall to seek a reprieve.
Sami’s is a popular lunch stop for Medical School students and for employees of the many Harvard-affiliated medical institutions in the area.
Stacey M. Brown, a project manager at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, gets her daily coffee from Amy Saba at Sami’s.
“Amy knew my name and exactly what I was going to order,” Brown said. “Wherever I go to get my coffee, it’s not going to be the same.”
Sami G. Saba, the owners’ son, said that he expects the stand will be forced to close if the city does not grant it a permit even without plumbing.
“This location is my parents’ only source of income,” the younger Sami said. “If they lose this, pretty much they’re going to lose the house.”
The Saba family started a petition online to muster support for the business. As of Thursday night, 221 people had signed.
Calling the potential closure of Sami’s “a terrible shame” and asking the city and Harvard not to “rob future generations of HMS students of the tradition of delicious, convenient Sami’s,” dozens of commenters spoke of the importance of the Sabas and their food to the Longwood Medical Area community.
One signer wrote, “This place is an icon. We, as residents, have to save this institution. It has kept many folks visiting loved ones in the hospitals well fed for years. Food being comfort, this place has been a rock for some.”
Another contributed, “We need Sami’s! Sami’s staff is the nicest, the food is wonderful, the cart looks nice where it is and it makes so many people happy. It is a major part of the Longwood community. Don’t ruin tradition.”
The Saba family wrote in the petition that they hope to buy a food truck and obtain a license to park on any public property. The petition includes a link to donate via PayPal to help the family purchase a truck.
The younger Sami said he was disappointed that Harvard has not made an effort to help the stand survive.
Shea, the Medical School administrator, said that he would consider approving an appropriately sized truck if the Sabas obtain one.
Speaking of the truck’s long residency at the Medical School, Shea said he would like to see it remain. “It works for us and has worked for us for a long time,” he said.

At its founding eight years ago, the Harvard Stem Cell Institute had fewer than ten principal faculty members, according to Benjamin D. Humphreys, co-director of the HSCI Kidney Program. Today, that number has ballooned to more than 80.
In the past decade, Harvard has increasingly poured resources into groundbreaking research in one of the largest collections of stem cell research labs in the country.
According to HSCI co-director Douglas A. Melton, a professor in the stem cell and regenerative biology department, there are more than 800 Harvard affiliates in stem cell science scattered throughout roughly 80 laboratories. The largest concentration of stem cell researchers are located in Harvard’s Sherman Fairchild Building, which reopened in August of 2011 after it underwent a two-year demolition and reconstruction project to accommodate the stem cell and regenerative biology department.
In the past decade, Harvard has focused on centralizing this research with the creation of HSCI and the stem cell and regenerative biology department.
HSCI consists of scientists and practitioners interested in stem cell research from all over the Harvard community, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the medical school, and 11 teaching hospitals and research institutions including the Children’s Hospital Boston and the Massachusetts General Hospital.
So far, HSCI has given out more than $100 million to its researchers, according to Humphreys.
"[Harvard has] definitely made a tangible commitment to stem cell research," Humphreys said. "The results are that we are leaders in certain areas—certainly I can speak of the kidney—not even just in the U.S., but worldwide in terms of stem cell research in the kidney."
With important potential applications such as the generation of cells and tissues that could be used for cell-based therapies, stem cells are at the forefront of scientific research. Stem cells, which can differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat some of the most serious diseases.
"What we’re doing at the HSCI Kidney Group is working collaboratively to identify new therapeutic strategies that will help slow disease progression," said Humphreys.
Still, Humphreys added that much more research is necessary before scientists can use stem cells to their fullest potential.
"Of course, making an artificial kidney would be one application," said Humphreys. "But truthfully, the kidney is so complicated that it’s second in complexity only to the brain in a number of cell types.... Making a truly artificial kidney in vitro is probably a long way off."
Regarding Harvard’s role in stem cell research, Humphreys said that he thinks Harvard should focus on developing and training the next generation of stem cell and regenerative medicine researchers who will make the big discoveries that will lead to transformative changes in the way doctors treat patients.
The human developmental and regenerative biology concentration, founded in 2009, will graduate its first class of more than 40 seniors this spring, according to Harvard College Facebook.
"[Harvard’s role is] to stimulate a dialogue through basic science and through public outreach by bringing people together, bringing our message out to other places to stimulate the discussion worldwide, and leading by example in order to fulfill the promises of this field," Humphreys said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Interest rates on student loans have become a point of contention between U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren in the 2012 U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts.
Brown has joined the group of Republican senators blocking a Democratic effort to pass legislation which would prevent interest rates on student loans from rising.
This move has sparked criticism from Warren, who strongly supports the bill. In a statement issued by her campaign, Warren called for students to rally against Scott’s vote on this legislation.
"Young people here in Massachusetts and across the country who are working hard and building a future—and our nation’s future—by investing in their education, should not suddenly face higher interest rates on their student loans," Warren said in a statement.
If Congress does not take action, 7.4 million college students nationwide may see interest rates on their federally subsidized Stafford loans double.
The interest rate for these loans currently sits at 3.4 percent, regulated by a provision passed by Congress in 2007. This rate, however, will spike to 6.8 percent on July 1, if Congress does not take measures to extend the current lower rate.
Stafford loans, typically taken out by middle class students, allow students to pay no interest while in colleges and then below market rates afterwards.
Institute of Politics Director C. M. "Trey" Grayson ’94 said that this debate over student loans has become important in the Massachusetts Senate race as well as in the presidential election because of its potential influence on college-age voters.
Grayson said that by joining this effort to filibuster the student loan legislation, Brown is attempting to maintain his image as a fiscally responsible legislator.
However, Grayson said that it is difficult for Brown to tout being on the defensive by blocking the bill.
"It puts him in a tough spot," Grayson said.
On Monday, Brown introduced his own legislation that would also keep interest rates on student loans low.
"It’s time to stop playing politics and get to work on a real bipartisan compromise to preserve current student loan rates. The job market is dismal and the cost of getting a college education is out of control," said Brown in a statement.
Though this issue may blow over quickly, the debate shows that Democrats, mindful of keeping their control of the Senate and retaking the House in this fall’s elections, are trying to force Republicans to vote against popular legislation in hopes of winning voters’ favor, Grayson said.
"They’re going to probably try to force [Brown] and some of the other vulnerable Republicans to do party line votes," Grayson said.
The Warren campaign’s statement pointed to a new study released on Monday by ProgressMass which shatters the "Brown bipartisanship myth" by showing that Brown votes "overwhelmingly" with Republicans.
Grayson said this debate over student loans might help Warren divert attention from Republicans’ claims [LINK] that her claims to Native American heritage are unsubstantiated and that she therefore may have committed academic fraud when applying for a position at Harvard Law School by deceiving the University into believing that she is Native American.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recipe for fame: Harvard + sports team + choreographed dance moves + "Call Me Maybe." Starting off as a way to pass the time on a roadtrip, members of the Crimson baseball team decided to cover Carly Rae Jepsen’s hit song. Little did they know that their boredom would lead to stardom.
“During our spring break trip, we had a long drive to one of our games, and we didn’t have much to do,” senior Jon Smart said. "'Call Me Maybe' came on my iPod, and we started goofing off.”
According to sophomore Steven Dill, the team often turns to dancing and singing in the car when they have a long road trip.
The group started piecing together a routine, with everybody adding to the choreography.
“We got really into the choreography, and before we knew it, we were having a blast,” Smart said.
“Someone would suggest a move or idea, then we’d argue about it, and try it out,” senior Jeff Reynolds added. “It definitely helped us pass the time.”
Directed and filmed by senior Connor Hulse, the video was uploaded to Facebook and YouTube for their own entertainment.
“It was really just meant to give our teammates in the other vans something to laugh about,” Reynolds explained. “Connor sat on it for a while, then posted it—it blew up, which was a huge surprise.”
Just four days after May 6, when the video was posted on YouTube, the Harvard baseball team has over two million hits, and has enjoyed thousands of comments, retweets, and TV time exposing their choreography, lip-synching ability, and personalities.
Much of the commentary has concerned itself not only with the humor involved, but also the players’ good looks. The stars of the video have had to deal with their newfound fame.
Seniors Marcus Way, the lead of the second verse, and Smart, the lead of the third verse who is now affectionately known as “the wink guy” have received a lot of female attention via Facebook messages, tweets, texts, and yes, phone calls.
“Marcus has probably gotten a hundred marriage proposals and some less appropriate things,” Reynolds said.
The views and comments are climbing on YouTube, all the while drawing more attention to the Harvard baseball team and the charity they support, the Friends of Jaclyn Foundation, an organization that supports children with pediatric brain tumors.
First, the team just posted the video, but when they saw it was going viral, they added a link to the Friends of Jaclyn Foundation website.
“We saw it as an opportunity to raise awareness for a great cause,” said Reynolds, who says working with the Foundation has been one of the “more meaningful and cooler things” the team has done.
“If half the people that watch the video click the link we put under the video, hopefully we will raise awareness and some money for them,” Smart added.
The Crimson adopted a boy named Alex as part of the FOJ Foundation, and have enjoyed having him and his mom at practices.
“We heard Alex watched the video and liked it, which is great,” Dill said.
“Originally, we didn’t think that anything would come of it,” Smart added. “But it’s really cool to be able to help Alex and the foundation.”
The team has been getting several calls, texts, messages, and tweets from old friends and colleagues, showing the spread of the video.
“It’s been fun to track its progression across the country,” Smart said of the video reaching Ohio, Texas, and beyond.
The spread has been assisted by several media outlets catching on to the craze.
So far, the team has received stories, shout-outs, and retweets from Sports Center ("@ SportsCenter: Guess it takes more than a van full of Harvard baseball players dancing to 'Call Me Maybe' to wake up their teammate"), the Huffington Post, Barstool Sports, Major League Baseball, ESPN analysts, Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, and Justin Bieber’s manager.
“I heard that Carly Rae retweeted the video, so we finally reached the source,” Smart joked.
Good Morning America also featured the team’s video.
“It’s unbelievable that we were on Good Morning America,” Way said. “None of us expected that.”
Much of the focus has been on sophomore Jack Colton, who is sleeping in the back for the entire video.
“I can confirm that Jack was passed out cold,” Smart added. “He doesn’t remember us filming at all.”
The team has been excited and surprised by the popularity of the video, but is enjoying the fame for now. Instead of studying, they’ve been gathering together in Lamont and watching the hits and comments go up.
“It’s been kind of overwhelming, but really fun and funny,” Dill said.
“I don’t think any of us are taking it too seriously, and we know in a couple weeks it will probably be over, but that’s fine with us,” Reynolds said, “It’s definitely been a good time and amazing to see.”
Being part of a viral video is a fun experience that the players will remember.
“Obviously we had a tough year on the field, but the video shows that we always stayed together as a team,” Reynolds said. “It was really fun making it…and it’s been fun watching it blow up.”
According to Smart, the players have been in “preliminary discussions” about another video.
“But some people want us to be a one hit wonder,” he said.
If not, the viral video world will miss them so bad, and they should know that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During his eight year career in the National Football League, former Cincinnati Bengals’ wide receiver Cris Collinsworth endured a number of painful leg injuries.
A damaged ankle suffered during the 1984 season voided a five-year contract he signed with the USFL’s Tampa Bay Bandits the following offseason because it made him uninsurable. A knee injury later forced the Pro Bowler to miss a combined 11 games during the 1987 and 1988 campaigns, which ultimately became the final two of his career because the ensuing structural damage left him unable to find a contract on the free agent market.
But this particular leg injury felt much worse, and it wasn’t even his.
This time, it had been suffered by his youngest daughter Ashley, who was lying on the ground in tears, holding her broken leg.
On a warm afternoon, she had tried, like her older brother Austin, to perform a trick on the tire swing in their backyard. But Austin, who now plays football at Notre Dame, had the physical ability to switch his body from one side to another without much trouble. Despite her best efforts to duplicate her brother’s talent, Ashley’s timing was off, and within seconds she was flying off the swing as her father watched in horror.
“That one I’ll never live down as long as I live,” Cris says. “She was just a little tiny peanut of a thing.... It was the worst parenting moment that I think I’ve ever had in my life.”
But despite Cris’ remorse as his daughter recovered over the following month, Ashley made sure her father didn’t feel any blame.
“All she did for the next five weeks was try to cheer me up,” Cris recalls. “She was still her bright, bubbly self as she sat there in her little pink cast and tried to make me feel better the whole time.”
Ashley’s leg fully healed, something that would later certainly become clear during an impressive high school track and field career that has continued at Harvard. But before taking up the sport, in her early years, Ashley instead put her legs—and her cheerful personality—to good use through her passion for dance, a hobby of hers since she was three years old.
“She would put on costumes and dance around the house,” Cris explains. “Whatever music was on, she was just one of those happy lights of a person. She entertained us all and just had a very vivacious, energetic personality that always seemed to brighten the room when she walked into it.”
As she grew up, Ashley used that effervescence to continue putting a smile on her father’s face—and even a tear in his eye.
“The big pouffy costumes, the hats that flowed in every way that make a dad cry, and then when the dance recital day comes around and they play the sweet little ballet numbers, and those three, four, five year olds are up there looking like beautiful ballerinas—that’s what I’ll remember most from those early days,” Cris says.
Meanwhile, though her father became increasingly well-known as a NFL commentator—a career path he took up soon after his playing days came to an end—Ashley says that fact didn’t make her childhood any different than that of her friends.
“He was always just a father to me,” she says. “He was always there, he was always the coach of all our teams, he was just like a normal dad.”
As she moved into her teenage years, Ashley continued to follow her passion for dance, later becoming captain of the Highlands High School team as a senior. But upon arriving at the school, she decided to put her talented legs to a new test by joining the track and field squad.
“All my friends were doing it,” says Ashley, who played on Highland’s soccer team as well. “It was just another fun sport to do.”
Ashley certainly had the genes to be successful in her new endeavor, as Cris had been considered one of the fastest receivers in the NFL during his playing days. He was so quick that on March 5, 1983, the Bengal attempted to race a horse, Mr. Hurry, in front of a large crowd at Latonia Race Course in Ohio.
The match ended up not being much of a contest—the horse won by a wide margin—but a quarter-century later Collinsworth decided to relive his passion for running by serving as the coach of Ashley’s high school track and field team in their hometown of Fort Thomas, Ky.
“I did it really just to be around her,” Cris explains. “Obviously I was traveling and [announcing] games during the season; all I wanted to do was just hang around the kids.”
The former athlete says he didn’t take his job too seriously, often goofing around in an attempt to make practices more fun.
“I would always run behind [the team] and sing that song, ‘Apple Bottom Jeans,’” Collinsworth—referring to T-Pain’s “Get Low”—recalls with a laugh. “I could do a couple verses of that.... They hated it because I can’t sing at all, and I certainly can’t sing one of their songs from their era. The more I would sing, the faster they would run. I think it directly led to four straight championships because they certainly did not want to hear me singing ‘Apple Bottom Jeans.’”
But the other Collinsworth also played a major role in sparking those consecutive state titles.
A Cincinnati Enquirer first team all-state standout as a junior and senior, Ashley won her team’s MVP and Most Valuable Sprinter awards and received the National Guard Best and Brightest Track Athlete honor as well. Like her father, Ashley ran with seemingly equine speed, winning two straight individual championships and setting the school record in the hundred-meter dash.
“She had shown some signs of being a great athlete, of being very competitive,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky says. “Meeting her on her recruiting trip, it was fairly clear what kind of mentality she would be bringing to our program, and we were very excited to add her to our team.”
Upon arriving at Harvard, Ashley immediately impressed, qualifying first in the 60-meter dash with the sixth-fastest time in school history before finishing third in that event and fifth in the 200-meter dash at December’s Harvard Open.
“She’s had some real flashes of brilliance,” Saretsky says. “We’ve seen that competitive drive and tenacity that we saw in prefrosh at various points during her freshman year.”
Thus far, the rookie has enjoyed being a part of a college squad.
“It’s been a great experience,” Ashley explains. “My best friends have come from the team. You have to learn to balance the schedule and everything, but once you do, it’s worth it.”
And Cris has been greatly impressed by her ability to succeed at that very task.
“I don’t think anybody could understand what its like to be an athlete at Harvard University,” says Cris, who was a first team Academic All-American himself at the University of Florida in 1980. “These brilliant young people are accomplishing so much in the library and in the classroom and in the chemistry labs, and to take a four-hour chunk out of every day to run around the track and then to compete at the high academic level that is Harvard University is a remarkable accomplishment.”
Indeed, it is often Ashley’s academic achievements, more so than her athletic ones, that stand out to the former football star.
“I’ve told her repeatedly that she’s taken my gene pool to a whole new level—there’s nothing in her genetic makeup on my side that would point to Harvard University,” he says, laughing. “There is nothing that anybody could do to make me any prouder of my daughter than what she’s accomplishing at Harvard.”
Cris is certainly not shy about that pride, never hesitating to drop the H-Bomb when he has the chance.
“I’ve actually made a science out of how to brag about my daughter,” he explains. “I’ve forced people—they’ll say, ‘tell me about your kids.’ I’ll reply, ‘I’ve got a son in South Bend, a daughter in Gainesville, and another daughter in Boston.’ South Bend they know is Notre Dame, Gainesville they know is Florida. Boston forces them to ask the next question: ‘Where in Boston?’ ‘Harvard’ always forces them to fall on the ground and say, ‘What?’”
“As a parent you just relish the moment,” he adds with a laugh. “The only thing that could make it better is if she would stay at Harvard for thirty years so I could do that for the rest of my life.”
Indeed, as Ashley has progressed through her freshman year, the former football star continues to be amazed by his daughter’s achievements.
“I think [the team] got back at two or three in the morning from the Hep Championships this past weekend,” he says. “Half the girls and guys had finals at eight or nine in the morning the next day. I’m certainly not demeaning the accomplishments of the other kids there, but to be able to do that—to study on a bus for seven hours driving to Philadelphia, to study on a bus for seven hours coming back, to get four to five hours of sleep and then take a final at Harvard University—to me is a remarkable accomplishment.”
“I’m sure every parent of Harvard students feels the same way,” he adds. “It’s playing in the Super Bowl, it’s being part of the Olympics, it’s achieving at the highest level in the world at the academic stage.”
And Cris, who played in two Super Bowls himself, certainly knows a thing or two about that very level. After serving as the Gators team captain and earning first-team All-American honors in 1980, Cris was a second-round pick of the Bengals in the following year’s NFL Draft. A 6’5” wideout, Collinsworth appeared on the cover of “Sports Illustrated” as a rookie, was named to three Pro Bowls, and surpassed 1,000 receiving yards four times during his eight year career.
Once his playing days had come to an end, Collinsworth became one of the NFL’s best-known commentators. Since 1989, he has served as an analyst for HBO’s (now Showtime’s) successful “Inside the NFL” and is also presently the color commentator on NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” and in the popular “Madden” video games. For his performances on those programs and others, Collinsworth won one of the two “Outstanding Sports Personality” Emmy Awards in 1997, 1998, and every year from 2002 to 2012 (for a record total of 13).
Though she’s not a huge football fan, Ashley admits she will sometimes tune in on Sunday nights just to hear her father’s voice.
“I’m proud of my dad and what he does,” Ashley says. “He works hard.”
Cris likewise feels the same way about his daughter.
“In every situation, she always takes the high ground, she always does the right thing, she always cares for her friends,” Cris says. “I tell my kids all the time, ‘I want you to be a great athlete, I want you to be great academically, I want you to achieve a lot of things, but mostly I want you to be a great person. If none of the other stuff happens and you’re a great person, then I’m okay with anything else that happens in your life—that’s the highest standard.’”
For her ability to meet that standard, Cris Collinsworth—despite earnings honors ranging from Pro Bowl appearances to Emmy Awards—thus believes his daughter Ashley is his greatest accomplishment.
“To me there’s no level of pride anybody could have in their child that would exceed mine,” he says. “She set that bar as high as it could be set.”
