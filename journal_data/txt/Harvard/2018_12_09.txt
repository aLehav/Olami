After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard faculty members will once again urge University administrators to divest the school’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry, according to an update on their website posted this month.
The group, Harvard Faculty for Divestment, sent an open letter in April 2014 to former University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — calling on them to divest completely from companies that promote the use of fossil fuels. More than 270 faculty members had signed that petition, including some as recently as 2017, as of Saturday evening.
“The President and Fellows are working assiduously to reduce the University’s greenhouse emissions, while maintaining investments that promote their increase locally and worldwide,” the letter reads. “The President and Fellows are right to be concerned about the ‘troubling inconsistency’ of these investments.”
An update posted to the group's website in Dec. 2018 states that the faculty will “issue renewed call for fossil fuel divestment.” The update does not specify when faculty will issue this call, or what specific action they will take to advocate divestment.
A Harvard spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.
Asked in an October interview whether Harvard would consider divesting from prisons, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he thinks the endowment is not the appropriate mechanism to enact social change.
“The University should not use the endowment... to achieve political ends or particular policy ends,” he said. “There are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don't think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.”
Faust also criticized the divestment movement in a press release in Oct. 2013. In the release, she wrote the University’s endowment is a “resource” and should not be thought of as “an instrument to impel social or political change.”
“Conceiving of the endowment not as an economic resource, but as a tool to inject the University into the political process or as a lever to exert economic pressure for social purposes, can entail serious risks to the independence of the academic enterprise,” Faust wrote.
She later reiterated her concerns with divestment in an April 2014 press release outlining steps Harvard would take to combat climate change — including appointing the first vice president for sustainable investing at Harvard Management Company, the University’s investing arm.
At the time, top administrators’ opposition to divestment prompted action from students and alumni who engaged in a weeklong protest and blockade of Massachusetts Hall, dubbed “Harvard Heat Week.” In addition to penning their open letter to administrators, several members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment supported these protesters and spent some or all of their classes during “Heat Week” discussing divestment and climate change.
Now, with a new president in Mass. Hall and a resurgence in student efforts around divestment, some faculty members say the time is right to return to the issue of Harvard’s investment in the fossil fuel industry.
“We never stopped feeling strongly that Harvard should end its association, its financial investment in the fossil fuel industry until it cleans up its act,” Harvard Law School Professor Bruce Hay said. “Now that the students started something again, I think we felt that we too should pick up where we left off."
Hay said faculty members who were originally part of the 2014 push for divestment met on Nov. 14 to discuss next steps, which may include an open letter to Bacow and the Corporation.
According to The Crimson’s 2018 survey of more than 1,000 members of the Faculty of Arts and Science, 67 percent of respondents indicated they believe Harvard should divest from fossil fuels, while just 9 percent reported they disagree with the proposal.
Other faculty members involved in the 2014 letter said the possibility of divestment might increase with a new president and the availability of more data on the worsening impacts of climate change.
An October report released by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts significant environmental and human impacts from warming temperatures by 2040. According to the report, even relatively small increases in temperature will put hundreds of millions of people at risk of drought, floods, extreme heat, and poverty.
“We think that the whole situation has changed, and maybe we have a new chance now to present this case,” Divinity School Professor Harvey J. Cox said. “We have students, faculty, and alumni, and we’re going to continue to keep raising this issue until we get some more favorable response from the Harvard administration."
Hay said he believes Harvard continues to discredit much of the research its professors conduct on the negative impacts of climate change with its investment in the fossil fuel industry.
“Here we are doing climate science and teaching environmental policy and you know, at the same time, we're investing in an industry that is dedicated to creating doubt and discredit, basically discrediting all of the science that we are doing,” he said.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Jane J. Mansbridge wrote in an email Saturday that climate change requires more action than research alone.
“When the fate of the entire planet is at stake, our university ought to do more than cultivate its own sustainability and promote worthy research,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a very rare occasion at Lavietes Pavilion when the coach at the visitor’s side of the bench is more tenured than the 37-season skipper of Harvard women’s basketball, Kathy Delaney-Smith.
This was the case Saturday afternoon, when Basketball Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer patrolled the opposing sideline and ultimately earned her 1,003th career win in a 60-49 victory for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Despite the double-digit loss of 60-49 at the final buzzer, Harvard clawed its way back from a 14-point fourth quarter deficit through an invigorating 13-2 run.
A Scarlet Knights team that had largely outmuscled and out-defended its hosts in the first 30 minutes of the contest seemed flustered by the Crimson’s sudden fury of high-paced offense in the final frame. Junior sharpshooter and lead scorer Katie Benzan knocked down a triple at the 7:07 mark to close the gap to seven. Junior forward Jeannie Boehm then located a cutting guard in first-year Maggie McCarthy for an easy layup. Boehm’s dish was reciprocated on the next possession with a fast-break finish as the Scarlet Knights lead shrunk to five.
“We switched up our offense just because [Rutgers] was in the passing lanes,” Benzan said. “We wanted to see if we could attack to the rim and see if we could create some offense in a different way. So I thought the spacing, the court really helped us with that ball movement.”
Holding strong for two more minutes, the Crimson executed a brilliantly designed in-bounds play that saw co-captain Sydney Skinner flush a mid-range jumper to draw the game to a 46-43 scoreline heading into the final three minutes of play.
Much to the dismay of the animated home crowd, this one-possession deficit was as close as Harvard would get in its comeback campaign. Two consecutive Rutgers steals brought the margin back to double digits, and Benzan’s flurry of triple attempts was of no avail as Harvard dropped its third consecutive game as part of a four-contest homestead.
“It was a tough one and it was frustrating, especially when we picked up the intensity and energy...and made like a really nice comeback,” Benzan added. “..It was just a bummer that we didn’t start with that intensity and energy and kept that through the entire game. But we played really hard and it was a good fight. So we can’t be too disappointed.”
Despite the late excitement, the Crimson as a whole largely struggled creating offensive opportunities in the face of its outsized opponents. From the field, Harvard shot 17-of-53 and was 27.6 percent from deep. For a three-point dependent squad, eight conversions over 29 attempts combined with 22 turnovers and 11 Scarlet Knights steals encapsulated the overall sluggish outing.
“We knew they were going to be athletic and scrappy, but the turnovers are hardly forced by them,” Delaney-Smith said. “... And then we didn’t hit the big shots that we should hit...Rutgers is great, athletic New York City basketball. So that’s a tough matchup.”
Rutgers redshirt sophomore Arella Guirantes and senior Stasha Carey posed serious issues for the Crimson in the interior, each tallying 19 points on 13-of-22 combined shooting. Of the 10 Scarlet Knights who logged playing time, six members stand at six foot or taller.
“We were just late to [Carey],...we adjusted and then someone else would be late to [Carey],” Delaney-Smith said. “We shut them down pretty well until you have to follow them. I was not displeased with our defense, [but] very displeased with our offense.”
With the absence of co-captain Madeline Raster due to a sprained ankle, the Crimson saw some important contributions from its underclassmen. Sophomore Maria Guramare and first-years Tess Sussman and Maggie McCarthy saw action in the contest. McCarthy in particular has stepped up with critical minutes in the past two contests, totaling 15 combined points in 48 minutes.
“[McCarthy’s] toughness, resilience and just her attitude...it’s so much fun to play with her,” Benzan said. “I’m really happy to see her hard work paying off and her just seizing the day.”
Alongside Benzan’s team-leading 18 points, Skinner was the other lone Harvard player in double digits with 14 points. The remaining Crimson players did not score more than four points individually. Sophomore forward Rachel Levy dressed in the starting lineup for the first time in her short career, earning 22 minutes and three points.
Overall, this was the fourth-ever meeting between the two sides, with the Crimson falling in the two team’s last encounter at the 2014 WNIT. Between Coach Delaney-Smith and Coach Stringer, the two have completed 83 seasons in the college ranks. With Harvard having challenged two storied programs this season — Notre Dame and Rutgers — those like Benzan have appreciated the rare opportunities while also maintaining a tempered outlook.
“It’s cool, I’m not going to lie...they’re big names,” said Benzan on playing in front of Coach McGraw and Coach Stringer. “Growing up, I’ve watched them on TV in the tournament, so it’s very cool to play against them. But again, they’re just people so you got to go out there and just play. They have to do all the same things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BURLINGTON, Vt. — As the clock ticked under two minutes, Harvard was tied with the University of Vermont as the capacity crowd at Patrick Gymnasium rose to its feet. For a second consecutive week, however, sloppy ball security led to a late defeat for the visitors as the Catamounts (7-3) pulled away for a 71-65 comeback victory.
Despite a season-high 17 points from senior guard Corey Johnson, the Crimson (4-5) struggled mightily to contain junior forward Anthony Lamb, who exploded for a career-high 37 points.
In addition to scoring 37 of his team’s 71 points, the Rochester, N.Y., native knocked down 14-of-22 field goals, and was the latest in a long line of scorers to catch fire against Harvard this season.
“We certainly couldn’t defend Lamb,” said Amaker of the junior’s outstanding performance. “I thought he was obviously the difference and how he just was inside and out and became a difference for their team.”
Exactly a week after falling to Siena in Albany, N.Y. by a 67-64 mark, Harvard came out firing early Saturday night. Making his first career start in place of the injured Christian Juzang, freshman Spencer Freedman sliced through the defense effectively in the first half, tallying nine points and catalyzing the visitors to a seven-point lead.
“He’s a great playmaker, a great point guard,” said Johnson of the first-year point guard’s performance. “He really leads the team well for a freshman on the floor. Just really excited to see his growth and development throughout the season.”
In addition to knocking down three first-half three-pointers, Freedman was integral in freeing up open looks for Johnson. The Ottawa, Ontario native, who had struggled early in the season, broke free in a big way, burying five first-half threes of his own. After starring in his time at Vermont Academy, Johnson registered his most impressive game of the season thus far in his return to the Green Mountain State.
“My teammates did a great job of finding me in transition,” Johnson said of his performance. “I was just trying to make and take open shots like my role on the team.”
Johnson and Freedman’s three-point explosions helped the Crimson end the first half on a 25-9 run against a team that had won three consecutive games, after trailing by as many as nine points in the early going.
“This is obviously a really good team and program and a tough place to play,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we brought great effort and energy and played a tremendous first half - we shot the ball pretty well.”
The three-point barrage early on was a welcome sight for Harvard, who had star forward Chris Lewis back in the lineup after missing three games. Lewis was held mostly in check by Lamb, who registered an impressive effort on both ends of the floor.
Ultimately, the Crimson was undone by its poor ball-handling, which has plagued the team frequently throughout the season. Despite owning a 38-24 advantage on the glass, Harvard’s shoddy ball security gave the Catamounts too many opportunities to claw their way back into the game in the second half.
The Crimson turned the ball over 21 times — on 32 percent of its possessions — while only forcing seven turnovers from Vermont. Allowing the Catamounts to register a 18-7 advantage on points off turnovers proved to be the difference in a back-and-forth game that featured three ties and seven lead changes.
“They sped us up in the second half,” Amaker said of the team’s struggles. “Other players than our main ball handlers had to make decisions with the ball, and that put is in some bad spots.”
For a second consecutive week, freshman Noah Kirkwood struggled mightily with ball-handling throughout Saturday’s contest. Registering five turnovers and four fouls in his 15 minutes of action, the two-time reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Week was only able to score two points. Kirkwood’s foul trouble, along with Juzang’s injury, forced Freedman to play 35 minutes to lead all players for both teams.
Harvard will have a two-week break before its next action, allowing its players to prepare for final exams before hosting George Washington University on December 22nd at Lavietes Pavilion.
The tilt will be a crucial one for the Crimson, who will look to resoundingly rebound from two tough losses, before embarking on its winter break trip to Atlanta and Chapel Hill. With matchups against Mercer College at State Farm Arena and the University of North Carolina looming, Harvard will surely come to play with a sense of urgency against the Colonials.
As the Crimson continue to search for its identity without Seth Towns, Bryce Aiken, and a seemingly revolving-door of injuries to Chris Lewis, Christian Juzang, and several other players, Saturday night marked another speed-bump in a season that the team hopes will end in an Ivy League title.
If Harvard hopes to win the Ancient Eight and receive the NCAA Tournament berth that it accompanies, the team must win away from home. Narrow losses to URI, Siena, and UVM away from Lavietes Pavilion are signs of a team that is still struggling to find its late-game form without Towns and Aiken. To get to the Big Dance, these are problems that the Crimson must solve.
Harvard will host George Washington at 2:00 P.M. on December 22nd, from the friendly confines of Lavietes Pavilion.
