After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MYSTIC, Connecticut—The lights on the Charles W. Morgan glitter softly from across the Mystic River as the hulking black ship rocks in the evening light. In the distance a whistle blows, signaling that it’s time for the drawbridge to go up, and for a cluster of white sailboats to cut across into the deep blue Atlantic.
Standing on the edge of the river, I breathe in the smell of salt and sea, and think about how, for me at least, Mystic has always been a place that exists outside of reality. It feels like adventure time again. Here, time seems to slow to a stop, and everything is like it was the first summer we spent up here, just after I’d finished first grade, when things seemed a whole lot simpler. Back then I towered over my brothers instead of the other way around, an afternoon with friends meant playing with dolls in the yard, and college was nothing more than somewhere the characters disappeared to in TV shows and movies. But then, of course, as soon as I really start to look there are a bunch of tiny details that prove time does keep moving after all.
The next morning as we make our way down the familiar stone path to the beach, we notice the redone dock with its fresh plastic planks reaching out into the sea a few months after hurricane Sandy ripped the old one away. There is a tiny bit of nostalgia as we remember slipping and sliding off the same slightly green, moldy wooden boards for the past however many summers. But after a few seconds, it’s not the dock that’s important anymore. It’s the laughter, the sound of splashing, diving, and the breathless, suspended moment before you hit the surface and submerge into the cool blue water.
And as we wander back to the beach, wrapped in towels with chattering teeth, it doesn’t matter that we’ve done the same thing hundreds of times, that we’ve spent countless afternoons climbing up a wooden ladder only to jump right off again. Because no matter what else happens, no matter what else changes, there is always this tiny, unchanging, perfect piece of summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could be the next political magnate to join the Harvard Kennedy School's roster of experienced politicians and policymakers.
"We have extended an invitation to Secretary Clinton to consider engaging with the university and would of course welcome her interest in a range of roles," Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an email to The Crimson on Thursday.
Politico reported Wednesday that both the Kennedy School and Yale University—where Clinton received her law degree—have offered the former secretary of state a position from which she could launch a presidential campaign for 2016, as many speculate she might. New York University and Baruch College, both institutions closer to Clinton's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., have also reached out to Clinton, according to Politico.
“A number of academic institutions have reached out with ideas. We’re following up with each to discuss them,” said Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill, according to Politico.
Politico reported that Clinton adviser Maggie Williams is handling those discussions, which are in the "listening" stages.
Gavel gave no indication of whether Clinton would come as a faculty member or in another capacity, should she come to Cambridge. Other possibilities include appointment to a fellowship such as the Angelopoulos Fellowship for high profile leaders transitioning out of public office.
Former President Bill Clinton helped announce the creation of the fellowship in 2011. Former President of Mexico Felipe Calderón, the program's first Fellow, will leave the post in December, leaving a possible vacancy for the former secretary.
According to a poll conducted on Aug. 1-2 by Rasmussen Reports, 63 percent of likely Democratic voters would vote for Clinton for president were the primary held at the time of the polling. Vice President Joe Biden trailed with only 12 percent of current support and the rest of potential candidates received support in the single digits.
Clinton has been a presence at Harvard in the past. In 2002, then Senator Clinton appeared at Harvard's Sanders Theatre to deliver a speech discussing the war in Afghanistan and criticizing the Bush tax cuts.
Clinton spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

Forget an honor code—we’ve found the solution to Harvard’s alleged cheating problem.
At Kasetsart University in Thailand, dozens of  students recently took an exam while wearing paper hats with side blinders intended to deter wandering eyes. The Wall Street Journal reported that the students helped make the blinder-hats after their professor asked them to devise a way to prevent cheating on the exam.
A photo of the experiment was reportedly posted on (and later taken down from) a school-affiliated Facebook page. But copies of the photo survived and went viral, to the great amusement of the World Wide Web.
A Harvard spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the College might consider adopting this unconventional approach to policing academic dishonesty.
