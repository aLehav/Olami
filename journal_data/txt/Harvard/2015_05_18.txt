“Tale of Tales” is a 17th-century Italian fairy tale that has influenced authors from the Grimm Brothers to J.K. Rowling with its fantastical interlocking stories of love and magic. However, as director Matteo Garrone mentioned during his Cannes press conference, the book is not as well known as its successors, and it was his intention to adapt its tales as a film that explores both their historic background and their universal values.
The film is an extremely visual piece—a collage full of bizarre monsters, towering mountains, grandiose castles, and exquisite costumes, full of many breathtaking moments: A queen sits in a huge, empty white room eating a giant heart; an ogre chases a girl through the forest. Garrone’s imagery so is so expressive in itself that it almost carries the narrative unaided.

Beyond its visual achievements, “Tale of Tales” succeeds in its hilarious and enchanting stories. All of the three tales, interlaced with one another, develop in surprising directions and become increasingly unexpected over time. This aspect of the film recalls Damián Szifron’s 2014 film “Wild Tales,” which is also a collection of stories that start as small conflicts and develop in unpredictable ways. However, unlike “Wild Tales,” Garrone tells the stories in parallel and often cuts to other stories right after the most suspenseful moments to keep viewers engaged in all of the movie’s threads.
Nevertheless, “Tale of Tales” has its flaws. For one, many of the stories are merely intended to surprise or entertain the audience, and in these cases neither the characters nor the story are explored in great depth. The film’s most obvious and probably most distracting problem, however, is its English dialogue. It feels odd to have characters speak English in an Italian film set in a land similar to ancient Europe, and many of the cast members do not speak English well.
In spite of its shortcomings, “Tale of Tales” still captures the spirit of the bedtime stories parents tell little children, tales that have been passed around for hundreds of years and evolved to different forms. The film’s biggest achievement is that it captures the liveliness of these stories and successfully presents them in visual form.

Let’s be clear: “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the best blockbuster of the last ten years, period. Packed from the first minute with breathtaking and non-stop action sequences, it is so devastatingly and aggressively exciting that even the pickiest critic should applaud mastermind director George Miller.
The energy level of the film starts at an incredibly high level: It opens with a 30-minute action sequence featuring Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa, Tom Hardy’s Max, and an entire army. Starting with Max’s attempt to escape from the Citadel, a fortress controlled by the tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Burne), the sequence develops into a full-blown battle and finally ends as the warrior Nux (Nicholas Hoult) drives towards a huge sandstorm, screaming maniacally, “What a lovely day!” The visual genius and intricate choreography evidenced in this first sequence are only surpassed by the fact that the rest of the 120-minute film maintains the intensity of this opening. In the age of “The Avengers” and “Transformers,” when special effects seem to be only about the number of explosions and the size of destruction, Miller shows that action sequences can still be creative, smart, and even artistic.

“Mad Max” is also something rare among current Hollywood blockbusters in that it spends very little time on exposition. It wastes no time in flashing back to the characters’ pasts, telling a clichéd or forced love story, or cramming in a childish moral lesson, all of which Hollywood seems to obsess over but are most often embarrassingly boring. Interestingly, although the movie almost solely consists of action sequences, the characters are much more three-dimensional than those in most summer blockbusters. They spend little time explaining who they are or what they are looking for, but they convey this message through their actions and choices. In particular, the director and screenwriter pay special attention to female characters—even supporting characters, who are usually objectified in blockbusters. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, for example, acts in both “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” and “Mad Max.” While in the former all she does is run and scream, in “Mad Max” she is an expecting mother determined to fight against her fate as a sex slave of Immortan Joe, someone who learns to be a real fighter from Furiosa. This alone proves that a $150 million Hollywood film does not necessarily have to be simple-minded.
“Mad Max” has many of the best action sequences of the last decade—even in the history of action films. At the same time, it deftly paints a number of believable characters and tells a straightforward story. “Mad Max” is everything a blockbuster should be.

Wonderfully experimental, Israeli filmmaker Elad Keidan’s directorial debut, “Hayored Lema’ala” (“Afterthought”)  is a disjointed but provocative black comedy that follows two characters in the Israeli town of Haifa. Uri (Itay Tiran) is a young man seeking to leave the country before his compulsory military service because his girlfriend has recently left him, while Moshe (Uri Klauzner) is a disgraced former teacher whose sole source of income is a series of children’s mechanical riding horses outside of supermarkets and shopping malls. As Uri climbs down Haifa’s Carmel Mountain towards the port, Moshe climbs up to look for his wife’s lost earring—and the two have a number of strange, coincidental experiences before and after they meet each other in the middle.
Keidan strategically uses the landscape of Haifa to the film’s advantage, as the stairs of Carmel Mountain are integral to the film’s narrative and unique visual aesthetic. The film truly captures the local flavor of Haifa, as various scenes traverse the same locations at different temporal moments when Uri or Moshe passes by a place that the other had previously visited. Moreover, Keidan—with the assistance of sound director Aviv Aldema—deftly uses the sounds of the cityscape to further establish the distinctive character of the city. The camera catches glimpses of conversations of people walking by and sound bites of random radio stations, all set to wide shots of the city so as to provide a far-reaching perspective.
However, several more experimental scenes detract from the narrative’s cohesiveness. For instance, the film’s lengthy opening scene features a rotating shot of Haifa set to various city sounds, which, at various zoom distances, provides an interesting introduction to the city—but at the cost of delaying the beginning of the film’s narrative. In addition, two musical scenes featuring Uri seem superfluous and thematically jarring in the context of the tone of their preceding and following scenes, especially one featuring Uri’s barbershop quartet—a truly surreal yet overly drawn-out indulgence in absurdity.
“Hayored Lema’ala” never produces any laugh-out-loud moments, but then again it doesn’t seem to aim to. At times light-hearted and at others starkly depressing, the film takes a philosophical bent in its treatment of modern Israeli life through the lens of two very different people united by coincidence. Though one might be enlightened by their adventures, the lack of definitive narrative catharsis leaves a sense that the two protagonists have returned—both physically and emotionally—back to exactly where they had started.

Hungarian director László Nemes holds nothing back in “Saul Fia,” his powerful directorial debut which was screened in competition at Cannes this year. It is rare for a director’s first film to earn the distinction of competing for the Palme d’Or, but Nemes’s film does so with aplomb. Moving at a grueling, breakneck pace, “Saul Fia” takes place inside a Nazi extermination camp and portrays the story of Saul, a Sonderkommando—one of many specially designated Jewish prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in their day-to-day operations.
From the film’s very first scene, the camera follows Saul (Geza Röhrig) as he moves swiftly throughout the camp and performs his various duties: picking up clothes, scrubbing bloody floors, and moving the bodies of dead Jewish prisoners out of gas chambers towards the furnaces. The film follows him quite literally—nearly the entire film is composed of lengthy tracking shots that closely shadow Saul around the camp, courtesy of cinematographer Mátyás Erdély. The audience is treated to constant close-ups of Saul’s face or shots from a perspective directly behind him that give the impression of physically being present and seeing the events of the film from his eyes. The film’s impossibly fast rhythm mimics the swift pace of the Nazi death camp, while its unusual, squarish aspect ratio and frequent manipulation of focus render much of Saul’s immediate surroundings indistinct, leaving only the film’s chaotic soundscape to imply the atrocities taking place around him.
“Saul Fia” focuses on the protagonist’s obsessive desire to provide a proper Jewish burial for a boy whose corpse he discovers in a gas chamber and whom he claims as his son. It’s unclear whether the boy is actually related to him—two separate scenes suggest that he actually is not—but Saul nevertheless on multiple occasions risks his own life and those of other prisoners who are planning a rebellion by stealing the boy’s body from the autopsy room and asking around for a Rabbi to say Kaddish. The film’s greatest weakness is in this narrative uncertainty—why would Saul go to such lengths to bury someone unrelated to him? It’s suggested that a proper Jewish burial is a symbolic victory against the Nazis—but even so, it doesn’t make sense that the other prisoners would continue to involve such an unreliable person in critical parts of their rebellion plans. Still, in the midst of Nemes’s wonderfully controlled chaos, big-picture narrative concerns fall to the wayside. As does Saul, the film moves swiftly from one scene to the next, and the utterly unpredictable and horrifying events that seem to occur every other minute make it an unsettling yet unforgettable experience.

Based on an autobiographical novel by Israeli author Amos Oz, “A Tale of Love and Darkness” tells a pivotal part of the history of Jerusalem—from World War II to the founding of Israel. Focusing on the vicissitudes of an ordinary family, it showcases surprisingly mature storytelling from first-time director Natalie Portman ’03, as well as her love for her hometown.
The movie starts in darkness, with the voice of a mother (Natalie Portman) talking to her son before he goes to bed. As she starts to make up a story with him, the audience sees a series of breathtaking surreal shots, from a huge flock of birds blocking the sky to a little boy deserted in an empty village. This scene sets up the style of the rest of the movie: elegant, moody, full of metaphors and fantasies. It seems obvious that Portman has put a lot of work into establishing and maintaining her style, and, as a new director, she is surprisingly sophisticated in carrying it out. The film is solemn, contemplative, and full of references to the rich and often painful history of the Jewish race.
The film shows how much its director loves Jerusalem, the city in which she grew up. As it follows protagonist through the streets of the ancient city, the film spends a lot of time gazing at the streets, the corners, and the people; in doing so, it traces back to the stories both personal to the main character and shared by all residents. Portman depicts the wartime hardship that Amos went through as a child, his mother’s love and sacrifice for the family, and the anxiety among people in the city with a nostalgic touch.
Admittedly, though, the film also has a large number of problems typical of directorial debuts. Most prominently, Portman seems too eager to convince the audience of her ability to direct—she tries to fill every shot with amazing cinematography, solemn emotions, and touching plot. Great films often need both moments that stand out and moments that set up the momentum. Portman, however, is so concerned with every single shot that sometimes the style of the movie seems like that of an commercial for an luxury brand. Portman also falters in trying to include all the characters and storylines mentioned in the book, regardless of their suitability for the medium of film.  Some episodes, such as the affair of the father, are not connected to the rest of the film and should be completely cut out. When it comes to selecting the right materials for her film, Portman still seems often hesitant and unsure about herself.
All things considered, “A Tale of Love and Darkness” is a delicate film full of genuine emotions. Despite its problems—many of which that are to be expected in a debut—it is still an impressive piece worthy of applause.

For a film that was booed at its first Cannes press screening—in front of the filmmakers themselves, no less—Gus Van Sant’s “The Sea of Trees” is not horrible by any means. With the ever-marketable Matthew McConaughey at its helm, along with two hours of gorgeous nature visuals by cinematographer Kasper Tuxen that are nicely complemented by a charming score from Mason Bates, perhaps the film’s only misstep is writer Chris Sparling’s script, which is filled with unabashed sentimentality that occasionally crosses the border into trite—an uncommon departure for a Van Sant film.
The film opens with a mostly dialogue-less montage of McConaughey’s character, Arthur Brennan, traveling to Japan’s Aokigahara forest, a beautiful location at the base of Mount Fuji known for its popularity as a suicide destination. Commonly referred to as the titular “Sea of Trees,” Aokigahara is also believed to be a spiritual place—what Americans would call “purgatory,” says a Japanese man named Takumi Nakamura (Ken Watanabe) whom Brennan encounters deep in the forest. Nakamura, dehydrated and wrists bloodied two days wandering the forest, has changed his mind about killing himself, and Brennan feels compelled to help him find his way out of the sprawling forest. As the two men travel through the perilously dense foliage, they learn more about each other and their personal motivations for coming to Aokigahara, growing into a truly moving rapport between McConaughey and Watanabe by the film’s end.
However, “The Sea of Trees” often feels like two separate films merged into one. In between scenes of Brennan and Nakamura travelling through the lush forest, the viewers are treated to flashbacks about Brennan’s life as an unpublished adjunct professor with a failing marriage (to a character played by Naomi Watts). The characters’ realization of their marital problems is touching, as Watts and McConaughey each bring the perfect amount of bipolar animosity and tenderness to their interactions. However, the death of Watts’s character—Brennan’s impetus for going to Aokigahara—is a subplot fraught with emotionally exploitative clichés that detract from the beauty of the present-day storyline. McConaughey’s gradual spiritual transformation in the forest hits all of the right dramatic beats, but its climax is similarly tainted by the script’s unnecessary narrative handholding, which reduces a moving moment of catharsis into a platitudinous, Disney-like ending. Nonetheless, these shortcomings don’t render the film much less enjoyable to watch. From breathtaking shots of the lush, green landscape to close-ups of the two men walking through the forest at night, “The Sea of Trees” is still a visual spectacle to behold—just less Cannes fare than standard Hollywood.

Hirokazu Koreeda, often considered successor of the legendary Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu, is famous for his slow-paced, delicately told films about lovers and families. “Umimachi Diary” (English “Our Little Sister”) is a standard Koreeda film in that it has almost no dramatic conflicts but instead focuses  the emotions and family bonding of four sisters in a family. It is so typical of Koreeda that it fails to surprise in any sense and seems to be produced on an assembly line with a standard art film formula.
“Umimachi Diary” begins when three sisters (played by Haruka Arase, Masami Nagasawa, and Kaho) go to a small village to attend the funeral of their father, whom they have not seen for 15 years. At the funeral, they meet their little half-sister Suzu (Suzu Hirose) and decide to take the now orphaned girl back to live with them. The rest of the film focuses on how Suzu adapts to the new way of life and her relationship with her three sisters, as she goes to a new school, join the local soccer team, and helps with housework. At the same time, the film also addresses each of the three other sisters’ problems with work and family.
The film does succeed in its execution of each individual subplot. The cinematography is beautiful, the performance is performances are easily connectable, and the pacing is natural. Koreeda shows his great power of observation when the emotional bonds of the characters are represented in or developed through the most tiny details like cooking or walking. However, all these details do not ever coalesce into a coherent whole. As the director tries to elaborate on every character, he ends up not fully exploiting the potential of any of them. While Koreeda tries to capture the passage of time through the travails of a family, he just shows a collection of interchangeable episodes that rarely give the audience a sense of development. Also, at times the beautiful shots landscape and Japanese food together with the rather sentimental music become so excessive that the film feels like some TV soap for housewives. In the end, none of the subplots are especially impressive, and the whole work fails to put itself above the hundreds of slow art films depicting ordinary families.
It would be unfair to call “Umimachi Diary” a bad film, because it’s delicate, well crafted and has many pretty moments. However, it falls short of being a great film, because these fragmented moments don’t work together to rise from mediocrity.

“An,” a Japanese word meaning “sweet red bean paste,” is used as filling in dorayaki, which are small circular pancake sandwiches. Much as an serves as the basis of dorayaki, so too does it play a central narrative role in director Naomi Kawase’s new film of the same name. Rhythms and repetition—among them the daily creation of an and dorayaki—form the basis of everyday life in the film. On a macro level, Kawase uses beautiful shots of cherry blossoms or other natural scenery to mark the turning of seasons and passage of time in the film, while every individual day is set against the routine of protagonist Sentaro (Masatoshi Nagase), who awakens early every morning for a rooftop cigarette before opening his small, street-corner dorayaki shop. We see him methodically drip batter onto a flattop stove to form the pancakes, we see him serve the same gossipy schoolgirls every afternoon, and we see him kindheartedly save each day’s rejected pancakes for Wakana (Kyara Uchida), a financially troubled teenage customer.
The first act of “An” is reminiscent of another film about an elderly Japanese restaurateur—the documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi.” Upon receiving an application for part-time work from a 76-year-old woman named Tokue (Kirin Kiki), Sentaro initially turns her down because of her age and weak, deformed hands; however, she eventually convinces him of his error through the high quality of her handmade an. Sentaro had been using factory-produced, bulk-ordered tins of low-quality an, but Tokue’s extensive, intricate home-production method yields a much more delicious result—which ultimately brings long lines of customers to Sentaro’s store and reinforces the age-old adage of hard work.
The film, which could easily stop at this feel-good moment, ultimately transforms into something else—a commentary on the importance of following your dreams in finding true happiness. Characters are not what they initially seem: It turns out that Sentaro runs the shop for reasons other than a passion for sweets; Tokue’s misshapen hands hint at a serious illness in her past; even Wakana’s future is in doubt as she contemplates foregoing high school to support her family. When the characters converge, they learn something more about themselves, and even past the film’s bittersweet denouement, the rhythms of the seasons still relentlessly continue. Kawase’s slow-burn drama ultimately teaches important lessons—and like the titular dessert, they are never too sweet.
