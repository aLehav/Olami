After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nowhere is safe.
Not the yoga studio when I’m wiping down my mat beside my friend. Not at brunch before our drinks arrive. Not in a two-minute conversation on JFK Street with someone I haven’t seen in a year.
All anyone seems to care about asking these days is: “What are you doing next?”
Every time someone asks, my heart pounds and my mind swirls. I don’t want to let people down. So I shrug my shoulders and silently hope that the conversation will move on. But inevitably, the conversation continues and the next question is: “Well, do you have an idea of what you want to do?”
I’ve gotten really good at changing the topic.
For friends in the same boat as me — jobless — we can commiserate when these interactions happen. But it’s a bit awkward sharing what I’m thinking about applying for, especially when it’s with a friend who has similar interests. I’m caught between wanting to support them and being faced with the reality that there’s usually only one position available.
For friends who have a job lined up or who are already working, you can see the hesitation in their eyes before they muster the courage to ask about post-graduate pursuits. Sometimes, they’ll preface it with: “Yeah, I’m not sure if I can ask, but…” In a one-on-one conversation, it’s less bad to ask. But that doesn’t mean you automatically should.
When in doubt, just don’t.
Especially not in front of a group of friends or another social setting.
For friends in industries like consulting and banking, which recruit in the fall — on a way too early timeline, if you ask me — congratulations on your fancy-schmancy offers. I am happy for you, but please be cognizant that most people don’t know what they’re doing yet.
Everyone’s on their own timeline. In fact, there is no timeline for finding a job after graduation beyond a stupid societal standard we’ve created. The assumption that you should know exactly what you want to do and where you want to be months before Commencement is an unrealistic expectation that only amplifies an already stressful time. The pressure to find a job, amongst other life things, can be overwhelming, and the question of “what’s next?” can unintentionally exacerbate that stress.
Trust me, I’m aware that graduation is two months away.
I know people who inquire about post-graduation job prospects generally want to help and do not intend to cause stress. Sometimes, discussing potential job options with trusted confidants or even strangers can be helpful.
It can be beneficial to bounce ideas off others when I initiate them. They might say: “It sounds like you’re really interested in doing X. I know someone doing X, too,” or: “Have you considered Y? I think you would be a great fit.”
It’s important that everyone has an outlet or at least feels comfortable talking about their post-graduation aspirations with someone. No one should suffer in silence.
There are ways to offer support to both friends and acquaintances without accidentally shaming them for not having a job offer.
Instead of asking: “What are you doing after graduation?”, consider: “What’s been occupying your mind lately?” Give people the space to share what they want to discuss, when they want to discuss it.
If jobs come up, try responding: “I’m happy to act as a sounding board if you ever need,” or: “How can I help you find your ideal job?” Offering support and understanding can be much more meaningful than simply asking the question that adds to the stress and pressure already felt by students.
If you slip up and blurt out the dreaded question, remember that “I don’t know yet” is a perfectly acceptable answer. Move on.
If you’re really curious to know how my job search is going: It’s going. I’m applying for positions that interest me, but I’m not applying for everything left and right just to have a job — and I recognize that this approach comes from a place of privilege. I’ve also applied for a couple of fellowships, but I’ve either been rejected or I’ll find out in April.
Right now, I want to make the most of my last semester. I have a thesis to write, readings to complete, and friends to see. Frankly, job hunting is not at the top of my priority list.
You might not be pleased to hear this, but it’s the truth. After years of taking exams and checking Canvas for assignments, I just want to sit and breathe. A little bit of nothing can’t hurt.
Rest assured, I promise that finding a job is at the back of my mind. I imagine the same holds true for others who don’t have a job yet.
But in the meantime, please stop asking about it.
Thanks in advance for your support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The six-minute subway ride between Harvard and Central Square isn’t the most entertaining journey. Passengers find ways to distract themselves as the T hurtles through a cavernous obscurity, averting their eyes from the dark expanse rushing by. But if they were to squint out the window as the Red Line rounded the curve out of Harvard Station, they could see the abandoned shell of another station briefly appear.
Rubble and residue sit where commuters once stood. Phantom platforms materialize and evaporate in the blink of an eye. Chalky, ghostlike graffiti lingers hauntingly for a few moments, emerging just long enough to sharply reflect the flickering fluorescent lights above. Other spindly apparitions project eerie shadows that dance against the peeling paint of the derelict columns.
It doesn’t stop there: The underside of Cambridge is veritably littered with abandoned subway stations. The original Harvard station, which once served as the terminus of the Red Line, opened in 1912 along the southwest corner of the Yard; today, its defunct platform is visible from the left side of inbound trains. Its wide, high-capacity station design was innovative for the time and inspired subway models in New York, Philadelphia, and elsewhere.
The single-track “Stadium” station, which was also established in 1912 and closed in the late 1960s, resided just across the street from Kirkland House and was used to transport spectators to and from Harvard football games. Because it was only operational for special events, the platform was more narrow than usual and there was no set fare.
In the late 1970s, when the MBTA began building the extension to Alewife, the original Harvard station was a direct obstacle to the path of construction; as such, the stop had to be temporarily rerouted twice. The Harvard-Brattle Station operated from 1979 to 1983 under what is now the Kennedy School and had a very makeshift feel, with wooden planks in lieu of a traditional platform. The Harvard-Holyoke Station stretched from Dunster Street to Holyoke Street and had a more finished appearance, with brick floors and tiled walls that are still visible on the right side of inbound trains as they zip by. In service from 1981 to 1983, it closed as the current Harvard Station opened.
Overall, the construction of the Alewife extension took over six years to complete and cost almost a quarter of a billion dollars in today’s money. The four decommissioned stations that lurk out of sight are urban memento mori reminding us that the city is constantly evolving and nothing is permanent. After all the effort, labor, and capital that went into the construction of the four Harvard stations, they now sprawl outward as forgotten skeletons of the Red Line. The current Harvard Station could one day be erased from our collective memory as well, increasingly relegated to a mere footnote in the MBTA’s ever-changing timeline until it, too, appears only in fleeting glimpses from the window of a speeding train.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Campus news often reads like a tracker of rote administrative decisions — that is, until a student transfers thousands of dollars of club funds to her own personal bank account.
On Jan. 1, Sama E.N. Kubba ’24, the former president of the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative, transferred approximately $30,000 from the HUFPI bank account into her own, triggering an ongoing dispute between herself and new club leadership.
A Crimson expose published last week revealed a pattern of profligate spending of HUFPI funds — at places including nail salons and an upscale French department store — and text messages that showed Kubba threatening to freeze club funding if she was not given a prominent speaker slot at a HUFPI-co-hosted summit. Kubba denies that she improperly used her HUFPI credit card.
Episodes like these — revealed through months of reporting, which uncovered details like the more than $4,000 in club funds spent on a corgi later referred to as the club’s “Ambassador of Love” — are undoubtedly rare at Harvard. But clubs on this campus that profit from Harvard’s deep-pocketed alumni and international name recognition are often flush with cash. Why would we expect students — who often lack any financial experience — to exercise sound management of their clubs’ funds?
We are strongly in favor of student self-governance: It is perhaps the greatest learning opportunity of the college experience. Student organizations, a cardinal component of the Harvard education, are especially rich with opportunities to grow as leaders.
But handing student leaders hundreds of thousands of dollars and expecting them to learn financial skills through trial and error is like handing a child a loaded gun and expecting them to teach themselves how to shoot.
Self-governance cannot mean total freedom from oversight, and this case has revealed to us the dearth of supervision for club funding at Harvard. There must be guardrails in place to prevent future fiduciary fumbles, particularly for newer clubs like HUFPI. The Dean of Students Office ought to have a public protocol for dealing with any disputes like these.
Within this protocol, any gross cases of misconduct should be thoroughly investigated and, if substantiated, met with disciplinary action, perhaps extending past the DSO. The College punishes students for academic dishonesty; we fail to see why egregious misconduct with registered College clubs should elicit a different reaction.
Outside of this post hoc protocol, the DSO should arrange measures to disincentivize improper monetary management, while preserving club independence. The DSO should offer — but not impose — rigorous financial training for club leaders and voluntary audits for clubs interested in resolving financial complaints. Yearly internal revenue reporting should be required from all student groups.
Club leaders are young adults who are likely learning to manage large sums of money for the first time. Although training will not prevent financial mismanagement from ill-intentioned actors, we believe that most students would benefit from more guidance. Especially given the large number of students who will graduate to work in finance and consulting — just over 40 percent last year — we believe College-provided financial instruction would be a broadly valuable experience.
Advisory boards composed of alumni or other stakeholders could also serve as a productive check on student organizations, without compromising their autonomy. While HUFPI and similar clubs may be relatively young, their budgets total more than what most Harvard graduates will earn per year upon graduation — enough to warrant an advisory board.
The HUFPI affair is an unresolved dispute and a cause for concern. It is also a stress test of Harvard’s ability to oversee its registered clubs — one that has revealed many holes in the system. Reforming the mechanisms of financial oversight should be a top priority for the DSO.
We love our clubs and we love corgis — we just don’t think one should be spending money on the other, a point College administrators raised with HUFPI. It would be nice if they also raised more safeguards around club funding at large.

David C. Atherton ’00 is an Assistant Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at Harvard College. He specializes in Japanese literature of the Edo period, and teaches multiple Japanese literature courses as well as Gen Ed 1067: “Creativity.”
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Why did you end up studying Japanese texts?
DA: As a kid, my family were followers of an Indian guru, and so we spent time as sort of pilgrims in India. I was an exchange student in high school to rural Thailand. I came to Harvard as an undergraduate and decided to study about China, and then ended up teaching English in Japan and learned Japanese along the way. And eventually that led to studying more about Japan.
Real answer, I think, to why I ended up turning it into more of a career — and even why I focus on something that may sound obscure, which is the 17th through the 19th centuries in particular — is because that time in Japan gets called the Early Modern period or the Edo period. It’s sort of like this reflection through the looking glass, in some ways, of our own time.
FM: Has that changed the way that you think about our current cultural moment?
DA: One thing that we think a lot about when I teach a traditional Japanese literature class is we’re really thinking about the nature of tradition, and how that intersects with creativity. Because when we think of tradition, we don’t necessarily think tradition is what makes you creative and expressive. But in the Japanese case, you can really see how so many authors are taking materials that already exist and sort of reworking them in creative ways.
Starting in the 18th century, in Western Europe, in particular, we get this new idea of the original author, the creative genius, and that still lingers with us in many ways to this day. But attending more to the dynamics of remix, pre-modern remix, and that reworking of tradition helps me see, I feel like, how much so much of our own culture prioritizes taking things that we already know and reworking them.
FM: You study these texts on an academic level. Do you ever also read them for fun?
DA: That’s the other reason I would say that I study what I study, is because the texts are actually really fun. When you get to the Edo period, in particular, it’s commercial literature. It’s designed to be sold, and so it has to entertain people.
We sort of think of literature with a capital “L.” You know, in my classes, we often read literally literature about farts. And seeing people do actually really creative things in writing about farts. Like, I’ll read that for fun. You don’t have to assign it to me.
FM: You also have an MA in Thai literature, right?
DA: I do. That’s where the big money is.
FM: Really?
DA: No. That’s where they really come knocking on the door, like, “Give us classical Siamese poetry!” It’s what they should — I mean, it’s wonderful.
When I was living in Japan, I went back to visit Thailand and just realized that it would be really nice to sort of deepen that connection and deepen that linguistic knowledge. And I suddenly realized, I read up a little bit, it was like, there’s all these genres of Thai literature that I’ve never heard of.
And it was really wonderful and I would have continued with it if there was the possibility of a job further down the line, but there’s no real field for Thai literary studies in the U.S. But getting those two years of getting to go deep with a language that is so playful, with just really seeing the power of what words can do. Even classical-type poems, they have the most elaborate rhyme schemes you can imagine.
FM: How has the field of East Asian Studies changed since you've been researching?
DA: East Asian Studies as a field is, in many ways, a product of World War II and the Cold War. So a lot of money went into, “Let's learn about these different regions” — this is true for all areas studies — “Let's learn about these different regions of the world because they’re fronts in global conflict, but we need to know about their culture, we need to know about their literature, we need to know their language.”
So that context has changed. A lot of that money has dried up, a lot of that mindset has dried up. It used to be very focused on countries: Japan, Korea, China, each one was its own kind of front. Now I think there’s a lot more focus on, particularly in more of the humanities side of East Asian Studies, how do we enter into conversations?
How can we find and contribute and generate interesting humanistic questions and different ways of thinking about things like literature and culture that are not bound by region at all?
FM: Have you visited Japan frequently?
DA: If you add it all together, I lived there for about five years: two years in a little fishing town as an English teacher, three years doing dissertation research in Tokyo, and then up until Covid, I would go back roughly every year.
FM: Did you have any particular experiences that stood out to you?
DA: Three days after arriving in the town, I went on a field trip with a bunch of middle schoolers where we all climbed Mount Fuji.
The thing that’s kind of fun about it is, and we did this, there are these little stations along the way as you climb up, and you can sleep overnight in them. So we climbed up, it’s summer, so it’s brutally hot at the bottom, everyone’s in t-shirts. By the time you’re at the top everyone’s bundled up like it’s winter. And you bed down in this little hut at night, and then wake up before dawn and everyone, we all had little headlamps, and you climb the rest of the way at dawn and then watch the sun — Land of the Rising Sun, right? — so watch the sun come up over the mountain, and they’ve got a post office up on top and you can get instant ramen and coffee.
FM: It was you and a bunch of middle schoolers?
DA: Yeah, and some teachers.
I then was going to become their teacher, but this was how I met them. We’re all in a bus for a bunch of hours, and now we’re climbing a mountain together. And then after that, it was, we went to a hot spring. And it was like, “Oh, now we’re all going to take our clothes off and take a bath together.” Wow! Okay. This is different. Including my colleagues. Oh, wow, we’re all — oh, wow. Now I’m a big lover of Japanese hot spring culture. But that was a sort of sudden awakening.
FM: What contemporary Japanese writers do you read?
DA: As an undergraduate I read a lot of Murakami Haruki, Haruki Murakami. And he was fun and exciting at that point, and then he just kind of started writing the same book over and over again. And now I don’t really read as much of his newer stuff because, “Oh, a cat appears! And a woman vanishes! And someone is cooking spaghetti!”
One contemporary author I really like is Ogawa Yōko, Yōko Ogawa. She’s fantastic, not as well known in the U.S.
I tend to read the older stuff more.
FM: What inspired you to create the “Creativity” Gen Ed?
DA: At the time I was — and continue to do a lot of work — thinking about the nature of creativity in the very specific context of early modern Japan, but had been reading sort of widely about, you know, just getting to know the field of creativity studies and realizing, “Oh, wait, it’s across all these different fields.” No one field even has a monopoly on it. Psychologists talk about it. Artists talk about it. People in business schools talk about. Neuroscientists talk about it. What is it?
I was reading these two leading scholars on, you know, the psychology of creativity, and they were, like, questions that must be addressed in creativity studies going forward. And the first question was, “What is creativity?” I was like, wow, this really is a wide-open field.
FM: Are there places in your own work or your hobbies that you think of as being particularly creative?
DA: I think of teaching itself as a fundamentally creative act. And really trying to think about, how do we shake up established models of teaching, so that we’re not all — instructors and students alike — just kind of going through the motions. Particularly at a place like Harvard, where undergraduates, as you may know, have so many things on their agenda every day. And they have 50-year plans, four-year or 50-year plans. And going to class can be just one thing in the middle of that. How do we make learning something that everyone is committed to and engaged in and not just another piece of the day to get through?
I have been taking a poetry class through the Extension School.
That’s challenging, but rewarding. And I like to think that ultimately scholarship at its best is creative. So like I have a book coming out later this year.
It wasn’t just, I’ve done my — I think this is true for everyone in the humanities — I haven’t just done my research and here’s the result. It’s, how do I really think about arranging what I have here in such a way that anybody can pick it up and find it engaging and grasp the ideas and follow it all the way to the end? To me, that feels like a creative process.
FM: What’s a book that you think everyone should read?
DA: A book that I really like teaching and have taught in my literature classes, but also taught it once for Hum 10, it’s called “The Life Of an Amorous Woman.” And that is a really entertaining and confounding text. Because it’s a book written in the voice of a woman who’s navigating her way through a kind of hypercapitalist society of the 1680s, relying on her wits, her talents, and her body. It’s written by a man who draws attention in various ways to the fact that, yes, this is a female character being portrayed by a man. The text is hyperaware of that gender dynamic and is playing with it, and playing even with the idea that there’s so many things said about what a woman should be and how women should behave.
And so when I teach it, I’ll often ask students, “How many of you thought this was hilarious?” and a bunch of students will raise their hand. I’ll say, “How many of you felt like this was more of a tragedy?” and a bunch of students will raise their hand. And it’s very rare, I think, to get a book that is so difficult to pin down and is doing so much in so many directions simultaneously, and at the same time is an entertaining and compelling page-turner.
FM: What is it like to come back here as a professor after having been at Harvard as an undergraduate?
DA: I had a really good time, but the year after I graduated, I think that entire year I never ate breakfast, because I was sleeping in every day as late as I could, just, I think, catching up on four years of sleep.
And one thing I’ve discovered coming back is just, I feel like that culture has, if anything, just ramped up all the more in the last 23 years. Everyone just seems to be going, going, going all the time, but also absolutely exhausted. So these last couple of weeks, whenever I walk into the “Creativity” class, people are there and they’re engaged, but they look just destroyed.
Everyone knows they’re doing too much, but no one can quite stop. I feel like I can see that now in a way that I couldn’t quite see before. So even in the “Creativity” class, I try to build in some spaces. We are going to have something this year called “Remember to Breathe Week,” where there’s no lectures, and there’s no class, but it’s scaffolded with everything we’ve been talking about in the class, about the importance of a little more breathing room, even to the creative process.
Can I ask you, how do you feel as an undergraduate?
FM: Bad.
DA: I was teaching classical Japanese and had one — it’s usually graduate students, but there was one first-year student. And so I was watching her land on campus, and kind of go through, you know, that matter of finding the limit, and I remember I was like — there’s one thing I can do here — I can articulate, like, it’s okay to do less. It’s okay to have a limit.
It’s okay to do less and just do what you enjoy in a way that you enjoy it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sama E.N. Kubba ’24, former president of the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative, released a statement on her personal website Wednesday addressing what she said were inaccuracies in a recent article published by The Harvard Crimson, which detailed the disputes and allegations of financial mismanagement surrounding her tenure as HUFPI president.
On March 3, The Crimson reported that Kubba transferred almost $30,000 from HUFPI’s bank account into her own, held complete control over the organization’s finances, and practiced improper spending habits with club funds — among other issues.
In her response published on a personal website, titled “Resolved: No Money is Missing, The Truth Is,” Kubba claimed The Crimson inaccurately portrayed her time as HUFPI president. She also outlined the contributions she made to HUFPI during her tenure and recounted her experience since The Crimson released its original investigation.
At the start of Kubba’s response, she questioned The Crimson’s objectivity and the integrity of its reporting and described the March 3 article as “inaccurate” and “filled with lies.”
“The Crimson offered themselves as a platform for HUFPI’s smear campaign and chose to ignore evidence I provided in favor of dramatic gossip,” she wrote.
In a Wednesday statement, The Crimson’s president Cara J. Chang ’24 wrote she believes the reporters of the original article were “in line with standard journalistic practice.”
“The reporters repeatedly sought comment from all parties mentioned in the story, including Kubba, who had ample time to review and respond to the details we planned to include in the story,” Chang wrote.
Kubba, who did not respond to a request for comment on Chang’s statement, alleged Wednesday in the statement on her personal website that The Crimson received but did not heed advice from University administrators before the story’s publication.
“The Harvard administration met with the Crimson before this article to warn them that the manner in which they are reporting this story is potentially unethical, and The Crimson still chose to go full steam ahead,” Kubba wrote.
As a financially and editorially independent newspaper, The Crimson did not meet with Harvard administration to discuss the decision to publish the original article.
Kubba wrote she was “deeply sad” to see a decline in HUFPI event attendance and member retention following The Crimson article’s publication despite the “hard work” she had put into the organization.
“The board had multiple resignations after the Crimson article, it seems the organization can no longer stand on its own financially, events are poorly attended, and new leadership does not even bother to show up for their own organization’s events,” she wrote. “HUFPI is falling apart and its leadership is more concerned with their agenda against me than doing what is best for the organization.”
“I acted in my best interest to protect HUFPI — I always have,” Kubba added.
In response to Kubba’s claims, Chang wrote that The Crimson remains committed to the original article.
“The Crimson’s investigation into the leadership dispute at HUFPI and financial mismanagement revolving around Kubba’s presidency was thorough, painstaking, and deeply reported, built on interviews with 10 current and former club members and more than 100 internal club emails and documents,” Chang wrote.
“The Crimson stands by its reporting,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard spent $580,000 lobbying the federal government in 2022 — the highest dollar amount of all Ivy League institutions for the sixth time in the past seven years.
The University’s lobbying expenditures rose for the second consecutive year, increasing by $20,000 from last year’s total. Before 2021, Harvard’s spending had declined over a three-year period, previously peaking in 2017 when the University shelled out $610,000 on federal lobbying.
Harvard, which maintains an office of federal relations in Washington, lobbied the government last year on issues including the excise tax placed on large university endowments, immigration reform, federal research investments, and funding for students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
Harvard University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in a statement that strong federal research investments are “particularly important this year in the effort to fund those commitments that passed as a part of the bipartisan Chips & Science Act.”
The CHIPS for America Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law last August, seeks to invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, promote research and development, and protect supply chain security.
The University also supported increased funding for higher education last year.
Harvard — a longtime supporter of increased Pell Grant funding — continued to lobby for the ​​​​Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, which seeks to expand eligibility for the grant and increase maximum funding amounts.
Harvard also supported the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the Future Act and the National Science Foundation for the Future Act, which would fund the NIST and NSF through 2026.
The University also lobbied for immigration reform last year, supporting the Dream Act and the American Dream and Promise Act. The bills aim to create new pathways to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program beneficiaries, also known as Dreamers.
Immigration reform has been a longstanding priority for University President Lawrence S. Bacow since the early months of his presidency. He has penned several letters to government officials in support of the DACA program during his tenure.
Harvard also lobbied lawmakers to provide Ukrainian and Afghan scholars with additional visa and travel support, according to the public lobbying disclosure form.
The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, shortly after Biden decided to pull the last remaining American troops out of the country.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, resulting in millions of Ukrainian refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. Harvard affiliates with ties to Ukraine and Russia previously criticized the University’s response to the crisis created by the war.
Bacow traveled to Washington in May 2022 to lobby Republican and Democratic lawmakers against the endowment tax, which requires universities with endowments exceeding $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent excise tax, as well as proposals that would tighten disclosure requirements for researchers receiving foreign funding.
Bacow met with Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.), Senator Mike K. Braun (R-Ind.), and outgoing Labor Secretary Marty Walsh during his lobbying trip last May.
Bacow has remained actively engaged in Harvard’s lobbying priorities throughout his presidency, according to Newton.
Harvard’s lobbying expenditures accounted for more than 20 percent of the $2.6 million that Ivy League universities spent lobbying the federal government.
Yale spent $530,000 on lobbying last year, trailing just behind Harvard as the second highest spender in the Ivy League. Princeton and Cornell spent $430,000 and $480,000, respectively. Columbia, Brown, and the University of Pennsylvania reported the lowest expenditures in 2022, reflecting the trend in previous years.
No data could be obtained for Dartmouth’s lobbying spending in 2022. In the past several years, Dartmouth has consistently fallen below the minimum mandated disclosure threshold for lobbying expenditures.
Columbia, Princeton, and Brown saw modest increases in their lobbying expenses since 2021. In 2022, Cornell matched its expenditures from the previous year, while Yale saw a slight decrease. The University of Pennsylvania reported spending nearly half as much last year on lobbying than the year before.

Former Sikyong of the Central Tibetan Administration Lobsang Sangay recounted his experience as the prominent political leader of a Tibetan exile organization amid political turmoil between Tibet and China at the 17th annual Tsai Lecture Wednesday.
A visiting fellow in Harvard Law School’s East Asian Legal Studies Program, Sangay gave his talk as part of the Tsai Lecture series, which is co-sponsored by the University’s Tsai Lecture Fund, Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, and Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute.
James Robson, director of the Asia Center and a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, opened the event, describing Sangay as “honorable.”
During the talk, Sangay shared photographs of his time as Sikyong and described his efforts to help Tibet achieve full independence from China.
Sangay said his decision to run for a spot in the Tibetan government was largely motivated by his deep Buddhist faith.
“For Buddhists, we are told you’re born and you’re bound to die,” Sangay said. “Now you’re going to die anyways, so what will you do when you leave?”
“I will do something where I can leave something behind and immediately it’d be your family, your community, your cause,” he added. “So as a Tibetan I have a choice here for Tibetan causes.”
Though Sangay said he has been criticized for his lack of experience and for “bringing the American system of election to the Tibetan society”, he “gave a smile anyways” and captured 55 percent of the vote for the position of Sikyong in 2011.
As the Tibetan independence movement’s progress stalled and Sangay’s attempts at dialogue with the Chinese government failed, Tibetans began performing self-immolation in protest, according to Sangay. 2012 alone saw 85 acts of self-immolation, he added.
“As a human being, life is precious,” Sangay said. “But as a Tibetan, I understand your aspirations — your aspirations are that you want to see the return of His Holiness Dalai Lama Tibet and freedom for Tibetans. I support that.”
“That is my aspiration too, so as a human being, please don’t do it,” he added.
Sangay also said he sought support from the United States government, meeting with officials in public places — including coffee shops, cafeterias, and hotels — because he said he was not permitted to enter the Department of State or the White House.
Though talks with the U.S. were initially unsuccessful, Sangay said he campaigned for Tibetan autonomy on CNN and BBC while engaging with other countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, and South Africa.
“Finally, after 10 years of being a nomad, wandering around, where I was rejected by anybody, I entered the State Department,” he said.
In part due to his efforts, Sangay said Congress passed the Tibetan Policy Support Act — which dictated that the succession of Tibetan Buddhist leaders would be left up to Tibetan Buddhists to decide without Chinese interference — in 2020.
Sangay concluded his talk by reiterating his commitment to the Tibetan movement.
“I’m born a freedom fighter, I’ll die a freedom fighter,” Sangay said. “So I will be part of the Tibetan movement for a long time.”
Correction: March 11, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Lobsang Sangay referenced 85,000 acts of self-immolation in support of Tibetan independence in 2012. In fact, Sangay said there were 85 of these acts.

Harvard’s Institute of Politics will aim to diversify the areas of expertise of the invited guests at its John F. Kennedy Jr. forums this fall, according to JFK Jr. Forum Committee Student Co-Chairs Robert Fogel ’25 and Ryan P. Tierney ’24.
The IOP typically hosts at least one of its flagship John F. Kennedy Jr. forums each week of the semester, regularly inviting top government officials and prominent political and business leaders to discuss pressing issues in current affairs.
In an interview last week, Fogel and Tierney — who began their terms this semester — said the committee will emphasize hosting forums in the fall that resonate with the broader Harvard student body.
“We’re always going to have the senators and the governors, and those people — those people are amazing,” Fogel said. “But there’s so much more to American government and politics than just elected officials.”
While still inviting the political “heavy hitters,” the committee hopes to reshape the forum’s traditional audience — many of whom are Government concentrators — to better reflect the Harvard student body as a whole, according to Fogel and Tierney.
“We really want to do a good job of bringing in people who don’t typically see themselves at the IOP,” Fogel said. “I want to be bringing in people who aren’t simply Gov concentrators.”
“I love Gov, but there’s so much more in the world than that, and the IOP has so much to offer the entire Harvard community,” he added.
Even as the committee expands the forum’s audience they will continue to shy away from inviting “very far-left Democrats” or “far-right Republicans” that don’t fall in line with Harvard’s “reputation for being the establishment” in terms of political ideology, Tierney said.
“Harvard’s name is such a big platform for people that we want to make sure that the voices we're bringing in reflect the values of the institution,” Tierney added.
With the 2024 presidential primaries slowly taking shape, Fogel said the committee is optimistic about bringing presidential candidates to the forum.
“I’m very hopeful that, as we get into primary season, we will be able to have some of these individuals, because the forum is such an important space to discuss important topics with potentially elected officials,” Fogel said.
Though the committee aims to expose students to as many primary candidates as possible, the IOP does not take stances on political ideology or races, Fogel said. Fogel floated the idea of hosting debates or town halls with presidential candidates.
“That could be an opportunity for us to have a kind of change in structure of how a forum looks, so it could be more balanced,” Tierney said.
Fogel and Tierney also lauded the recent appointment of Laura C. Dove as senior director of administration at the IOP, with Tierney saying that her connections to Washington circles and management of “day-to-day” operations have allowed the committee to begin inviting potential guests to the forum for the fall semester.
“We have the infrastructure in place, after that transition, to be able to plan these things out well in advance,” Tierney said. “I think the caliber of names that we are leveraging connections for the fall is even a step up.”

Harvard Law School professor Laura M. Weinrib ’00 discussed the legal history of campaign finance regulations and its connection to economic inequality at a lecture Thursday.
Weinrib’s lecture, titled “Money, Politics, and the Constitution in the ‘Golden Age’ of Capitalism,” honored her 2021 appointment as the Fred N. Fishman Professor of Constitutional Law. In introductory remarks, Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 lauded Weinrib’s research and scholarship in the history of law.
“She is a legal historian who writes with deep insight about how social movements have transformed constitutional categories to pursue political and economic change,” Manning said.
During the lecture, Weinrib said federal court decisions that apply the First Amendment to block certain campaign finance restrictions have in part caused campaign spending in the United States to grow “out of control.”
“It’s chilling to think about the dollar tag attached to the 2022 midterm — over $17 billion — and to compare it with fights over the budget for assistance to families living in poverty,” she said. “A lot of the political spending in the United States comes from small donors, but the part that doesn’t comes disproportionately from corporations, business executives, and business advocacy groups.”
Weinrib said she is currently researching the regulation of political spending by unions in the mid-20th century — a time she called “the golden age of capitalism.” According to Weinrib, this period coincided with the peak strength of unions, whose political spending served as a “counterpoint” to corporate funding of political campaigns.
“Union spending in the United States has declined because unions in the United States have declined,” she said. “What I want to propose today is that unions’ constitutional campaign against efforts to limit their political spending is part of the reason why.”
Weinrib referred to a 1956 memo by the law department of the National Association of Manufacturers, which she said “surmised that the court’s statutory protection for union spending would apply to corporate spending as well.”
“Under the statute, it concluded what is sauce for the goose is saucer for the gander, and so despite initial reluctance to publicly enter the political fray, business groups formed their own PACs and launched their own spending campaigns,” she added.
Political spending by corporations, she said, continued to “explode” amid labor unions’ declines in “power and funds.”
In her lecture, Weinrib said this increase in political capital held by corporations is linked to increases in economic inequality.
“The dominance of corporate money in American politics is both exacerbating inequalities and undermining unions,” she said.
Efforts to address rising inequality in the U.S., Weinrib said, should focus on bolstering the power of unions.
“I believe deeply that union power is critical to reversing the rapidly rising economic inequality that plagues the United States today,” Weinrib said.

Egyptologist Victoria Almansa-Villatoro, a junior research fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows, delivered a lecture on meteoritic iron in ancient Egypt hosted by the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture Thursday evening.
In her lecture, titled “Iron in the Sky: Meteorites in Ancient Egypt,” Almansa-Villatoro used texts, iconography, and ritual objects excavated from pre-Iron Age pyramids to discuss whether ancient Egyptians understood that meteorites came “out of the sky.”
The subject of the lecture came from Almansa-Villatoro’s 2020 research article “The Cultural Indexicality of the N41 Sign for bjȝ: The Metal of the Sky and the Sky of Metal,” which was published in the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology.
Almansa-Villatoro began the lecture by explaining that the earliest evidence of an iron object in the world comes from Egypt, which “came last to the Iron Age” — a period lasting from the 1200 to approximately 550 BCE when use of iron became “much more widespread.”
The crux of her talk focused on the ancient Egyptian hieroglyph bjȝ, which scholars associate with both iron and the sky.
“Besides these metallic associations, bjȝ also means sky — simply sky — and in particular, the sky as an ocean that must be ferried across,” she said.
“If the sky contains water that falls on Earth like rain, it can contain also iron that fall on earth as meteorites,” she added.
According to Almansa-Villatoro, the hieroglyph bjȝ has appeared on the walls of pre-Iron Age pyramids. Archaeologists have discovered bjȝ in texts of Egyptian creation myths, including a story about a broken primeval egg, which she defined as “an element of creation also associated with the womb of the sky goddess Nut.”
Through the association of bjȝ with Egyptian mythology, Almansa-Villatoro argued that ancient Egyptians linked the hieroglyph to the concept of rebirth.
“Breaking the egg means reversing the natural order of birth and death and those going from death to reverse — which is a metaphor for resurrection inside the womb sky,” Almansa-Villatoro said.
At the close of the talk, Almansa-Villatoro said she hopes her findings illustrate a concise application of objective research procedures in Egyptology.
“If we want to argue that Egypt has a place in the history of science, we may need to detach ourselves of our ideas of how science should be produced and recorded and approached,” she said.

Dozens of Harvard students and organizers rallied against a plan by Atlanta officials to create a police training center — which activists have dubbed “Cop City” — at a Thursday protest in Harvard Yard.
Attendees of the Harvard Yard rally gathered outside of the MBTA station in Harvard Square, holding signs before marching through Harvard Yard and participating in chants of “Stop Cop City” and “Defend the forest.” Organizers and activists then spoke to attendees on the steps of University Hall.
The plan for the training center in Atlanta has led to significant backlash and widespread protests over the last 18 months. Protesters have occupied areas of the forest where construction is set to take place.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Dec. 13 that Georgia authorities were attempting to clear the forest of protesters, with some activists alleging the use of tear gas and pepper balls. Clashes between police and protesters in the months since have led to dozens being charged with domestic terrorism for allegedly throwing rocks, bricks, fireworks, and Molotov cocktails at police.
Organizers of the Harvard rally said the protest was part of a national day of solidarity in support of the Defend the Atlanta Forest Movement.
On Jan. 18, Venezuelan environmental activist Manuel Esteban Paez Terán was shot and killed by police officers after allegedly opening fire on police. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Paez Terán shot a Georgia State Patrol Officer before they were shot by police and died on the scene.
Activists in Harvard Yard held a moment of silence for Paez Terán, who they referred to by their nickname, “Tortuguita,” remembering them as a peaceful protester.
The Georgia Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Georgia State Patrol, did not immediately respond to requests for comment following the protest.
Some rallygoers took issue with the charge of domestic terrorism against protesters.
“When the people who seek to defend us are labeled terrorists and criminalized and face decades in prison, it’s an assault on all of us,” Monty Neill, an organizer with environmental advocacy group Extinction Rebellion, said.
Uniformed Cambridge Police Department and Harvard University Police Department officers appeared to monitor the protest.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick confirmed that Cambridge police officers were present due to the planned protest. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment, citing long-standing department policy.
Karen Choi ’25 said at the rally that the events in Georgia have left her “shaken and fearful.”
“Where’s the democracy and freedom of speech that America so often praises?” Choi asked. “Where’s the land of the free that America so often preaches?”
Despite these concerns, Choi called on attendees to remain optimistic.
“Let this be a reminder that we are not alone,” she said. “Put the hope in everything you do.”

Harvard received at least $20 million from major fossil fuel companies from 2010 to 2020, according to a new report by Data for Progress in collaboration with Fossil Free Research, a campaign advocating against the financial influence of fossil fuel companies in climate research.
In the report, think tank and polling firm Data for Progress evaluated the contributions of fossil fuel companies ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and Koch Industries to 27 universities across the U.S., including Harvard, between 2010 and 2020.
“Harvard is huge, right? Harvard is the university everyone looks up to, and the fact that Harvard takes $20 million-plus of fossil fuel money is super dangerous for climate research,” said Isabella K. Kumar, lead author of the Data for Progress report.
Additionally, the report analyzed responses to both a nationwide survey and a university-based poll on fossil fuel-funded research. One of the questions in the survey claimed that several universities, including Harvard, “have used donations from the fossil fuel industry to fund climate and environmental research.”
“Knowing what you know, do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of the following institutions?” the survey then asked, listing universities including Harvard.
The report showed that Harvard’s favorability rating dropped by 14 points — from 61 to 47 percent — when the survey presented respondents with the claim that Harvard has used fossil fuel donations to fund climate research.
“What this shows is that Harvard loses credibility, and it undermines itself — it loses the public’s trust when it takes this kind of funding,” said Phoebe G. Barr ’23-’24, a researcher for the report and an organizer for Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the report.
According to the website of Harvard’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, the institute “will not accept funds from, or partner with, any company that does not share the goal of moving our global economy away from fossil fuels.”
On Jan. 18, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard Alumni released a similar report demanding that the University reject funding from companies tied to the fossil fuel industry. The report claimed that climate and environmental policy programs at Harvard have financial connections to Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell.
Kumar said that — though she does not know for certain whether donations by fossil fuel companies go to climate research due to lack of information about donations to universities — she “would assume, and I think the general consensus is, that it is largely going to research funding.”
Grace E. Adcox, a Data for Progress polling analyst, said the research group ran into issues during data collection due to a “complete lack of transparency” from universities about what they fund with donations from fossil fuel companies.
“So it’s actually quite difficult to ascertain where fossil fuel money is going within universities,” Adcox said.
Co-Executive Director of Fossil Free Research Jake E. Lowe said the numbers they found on fossil fuel funding were only a “lower bound.”
“What’s really important about this report is that this figure we’ve come up with is most certainly just a fraction of the total. It’s a lower end of what’s likely a much bigger number, because it’s just what’s publicly available,” he said.
One of the report’s two major policy recommendations calls for more transparency from universities around funding. The report’s other major policy recommendation calls for stronger policies around research conflicts of interest and gifts.
“There’s just an inherent bias to appease a funder when they’re funding the research for all kinds of fields, particularly if you want more funding down the line,” Lowe said. “And then when that research that favors industry goes on to inform climate policy, we think that’s a big issue, because it’s super clear that the fossil fuel industry is not interested in taking climate change seriously.”
Kumar said she hopes that this report can serve as a launching point for the Fossil Free Research campaign.
“I know Harvard already has a super strong divestment campaign, as well as a new fossil fuel money campaign,” Kumar said. “I hope that you guys use this and take this as an additional aspect of credibility for those campaigns to say that there is a report that states that this is actually happening, and that you’re not just making this up.”

Two-time Booker Prize-winning author Margaret Atwood spoke to a packed crowd of fans in Sanders Theatre about her newly published short story collection “Old Babes in the Wood” Thursday.
Atwood joined Scott Tong, journalist and co-host of “Here & Now” on WBUR Boston, to discuss how “Old Babes in the Wood” reflects Atwood’s life experiences. The event was co-sponsored by Harvard Book Store and the Mahindra Humanities Center, as part of the latter’s “Writers Speak” Series.
An alumna of Harvard University, Atwood was awarded the Radcliffe Medal in 2003 for her work in feminist literature, including her 1985 classic novel “The Handmaid’s Tale.” The novel won Canada’s Governor General’s Literary Award in 1985 and the first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987, in addition to being nominated for the 1986 Booker Prize. It was later adapted into the 2017 Hulu series of the same name.
Atwood began the interview by joking about Harvard’s reception of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” given that her dystopian setting of Gilead was based on Cambridge.
“Harvard was not amused when this book was first published,” Atwood said. “They did not think it was fun to have bodies hanging on the Harvard wall.”
“They took a dim view, but they have come around since,” she added. “Otherwise, they wouldn’t have let me in.”
The conversation progressed to a discussion of Atwood’s new work, “Old Babes in the Wood.” Atwood used the collection of short stories as a social commentary on the Covid-19 pandemic, similar to how “The Handmaid’s Tale” commented on women’s autonomy.
During the event, Atwood said the stories in “Old Babes in the Wood” were largely influenced by pandemic-era life and politics, which Atwood related to Giovanni Boccaccio’s Black Death-inspired stories in “The Decameron.”
Inspired by both world events and events in her life, Atwood said she chose to dedicate the book to her late husband, Graeme Gibson. During the event, she remarked on how the relationship between characters Tig and Nel in “Old Babes in the Wood” was inspired by her marriage with Gibson.
During the event’s question-and-answer session, audience members asked about banned books and Atwood’s status as a frequently banned author — referencing an infamous meme in which the author uses a flamethrower on a fireproof copy of “The Handmaid’s Tale.”
“It’s been a repeated pattern,” Atwood said of book-banning, adding that “The Handmaid’s Tale” is among the most commonly banned books in the United States.
She said she “fondly hoped” those who have banned the book misunderstood it and were not “actually wishing to install an authoritarian state.”
Atwood showcased her sense of humor throughout the event, drawing laughter from the audience through witty responses to questions about her favorite method of procrastination and her age.
Kristen L. Palma, an attendee of the event, said she was excited to see the widely acclaimed author in person.
“I have been a fan of hers for as long as I can remember, at least since I was in college,” Palma said. “She is just one of the most creative and smart, inspiring writers.”

Former Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative President Sama E.N. Kubba ’24 denied recent reporting of financial misconduct in a statement on her personal website Wednesday — though club leaders said they are still awaiting the return of more than half of the approximately $30,000 she transferred to her personal account.
Kubba wrote in the statement that she no longer has access to any of the funds, having returned the approximately $15,000 she said she could transfer. The rest, she wrote, remains frozen by Bank of America at the request of HUFPI. As of Thursday evening, Kubba has not provided any supporting evidence for her statement on the website.
A two-month investigation by The Crimson published last week detailed allegations of internal conflict and financial misconduct surrounding Kubba’s tenure at HUFPI. The investigation found that Kubba transferred approximately $30,000 from the organization’s bank account to her own in early January, weeks after departing from the presidency.
Kubba acknowledged the initial transfer in the statement on her website Wednesday, though reiterated her position that she did so to prevent funds being “lost to fraud.”
“HUFPI got half of the money returned a month before the article’s release, and the other half is held by Bank of America due to a hold initiated by HUFPI ($15k) – not something I have control over,” Kubba wrote in the statement on her website. “No money is missing; nothing is unresolved. The only money not ‘returned’ is held by Bank of America at HUFPI’s request.”
Kubba did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Crimson following the release of her statement, and declined a telephone interview Thursday evening.
Kubba sent the club a cashier’s check for $11,483 last month, according to Kubba and three sources familiar with the situation. HUFPI Co-Presidents Cosette T. Wu ’25 and Joyce Chen ’25 acknowledged that some funds had been returned in a Thursday statement on behalf of the club.
“Regarding the wrongfully converted $30,000, HUFPI has secured a total of just below half of the original outstanding balance from the relevant actor,” Wu and Chen wrote.
In a follow-up statement on behalf of HUFPI, Wu and Chen denied that HUFPI is responsible for the hold on Kubba’s bank account.
“On January 13th, HUFPI canceled all pending fraud claims on its bank accounts,” Wu and Chen wrote. “HUFPI was later notified by Bank of America that these cancellations were completed on January 17th. The organization maintains no current claims on any of its accounts.”
According to a January email from HUFPI leadership to Kubba obtained by The Crimson, the organization had previously pursued a fraud claim regarding the initial approximately $30,000 transfer, after they discovered the funds were missing.
Along with a $3,500 Zelle payment made to the club in January, Kubba has now repaid approximately $15,000 to the club.
According to a Thursday statement from Wu and Chen on behalf of HUFPI, the club is yet to regain access to several of their media accounts — including their Instagram and website — after Kubba revoked their access in early January.
Kubba previously offered to return the transferred funds and social media accounts in exchange for more than $10,000 — including compensation for the club-funded trips that she was removed from following the initial transfer as well as $5,000 for “emotional distress and wrongdoing.”
In her statement Wednesday, Kubba wrote that HUFPI was not cooperative with her, adding that the club “snubbed” repeated efforts for a “peaceful solution.”
Three sources familiar with the situation indicated that Kubba and HUFPI are actively navigating a peer dispute through the Harvard College Administrative Board.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment on the state of the dispute, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
HUFPI declined to comment on the involvement of the Ad Board. Kubba did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ad Board involvement.
After The Crimson reported that HUFPI accused Kubba in a Jan. 4 email of having improperly used her credit card during her tenure as president, Kubba again denied having done so in the statement, highlighting the number of people who had access to the card.
“Everyone in HUFPI used my Presidential credit cards; it was the default for anyone’s needs and I had multiple cards in my name – including for one of the now co-presidents,” Kubba wrote. “The idea that I abused HUFPI funds for personal purposes is a lie.”
Wu and Chen indicated in a statement on behalf of HUFPI that the club is still seeking repayment for credit charges during Kubba’s tenure.
“No funds relating to alleged misspending on the organization’s credit or involving other significant transfers made as late as January 12th have been recuperated,” Wu and Chen wrote.
An internal record of transactions of Kubba’s HUFPI credit card obtained by The Crimson includes $275 in expenses at hair and nail salons. One transaction for $122 occurred at The Nail Shop in Virginia Beach — Kubba’s hometown.
The transaction record also shows more than $1,200 in expenses at a high-end French department store, while HUFPI was in Paris on a foreign policy trip.
In an emailed statement Wednesday on behalf of HUFPI, Wu and Chen maintained that purchases made on the card were Kubba’s responsibility.
“Members of HUFPI holding corporate credit cards are required to abide by an org-wide policy guide which stipulates regulations and limitations on card usage,” Wu and Chen wrote. “Above all, in holding a company card, members of the organization agree to accept full responsibility for purchases made on their card and under their name.”
In her post Wednesday, Kubba also took aim at the club’s current leadership, as well as The Crimson’s reporting of the dispute.
“Now I am disappointed in HUFPI for wasting my hard work,” her statement reads. “The board had multiple resignations after the Crimson article, it seems the organization can no longer stand on its own financially, events are poorly attended, and new leadership does not even bother to show up for their own organization’s events.”
Wu and Chen refuted Kubba’s characterization.
“There have been no changes to Board membership following the Harvard Crimson’s most recent reporting,” Wu and Chen wrote. “The organization remains solvent, sound, and committed to its mission for years to come.”

Amid a legal battle over Harvard’s possession of images of enslaved people, Middlesex County Superior Court is set to hear a revived emotional distress lawsuit on April 13 brought by Tamara K. Lanier against the University.
Lanier initially filed the lawsuit against Harvard in March 2019, alleging that the University was in wrongful possession of daguerreotype images — which are currently housed in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology — depicting two enslaved individuals, Renty and Delia, who she claims are her ancestors.
Though the lawsuit was dismissed by Middlesex County Superior Court in March 2021, Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in June 2022 that Lanier has grounds to sue Harvard for emotional distress, marking a partial overturning of the lower court’s decision. She then amended her initial complaint to include reckless, in addition to negligent, infliction of emotional distress in October 2022.
In December 2022, Harvard submitted a motion to dismiss Lanier’s emotional distress claim, arguing in a 75-page memorandum, including exhibits, that Lanier’s new motion realleged her previous claims — which were dismissed by the lower court. The University also argued that Lanier requested forms of relief, such as the restitution of the daguerreotypes, which were “plainly unavailable” for the claim of infliction of emotional distress.
“The remaining causes of action allow only the recovery of compensatory damages for emotional distress,” the motion reads. “Thus, Ms. Lanier’s other requests for relief should be stricken from the complaint.”
After Lanier filed a 153-page response a month later rebutting Harvard’s motion, the University filed a reply in February in support of their earlier motion.
Joshua D. Koskoff, one of Lanier’s attorneys, wrote in an email that the new motion is another effort for Harvard to “avoid its accountability.”
“The legal process is built on transparency and cooperation and that is what Tamara Lanier deserves,” Koskoff wrote. “Harvard says it didn’t do anything wrong, so it should be eager to get to the discovery process, but for some reason that doesn’t appear to be the case.”
Lanier characterized the Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling as a “stinging indictment” of the University.
“What they also did was something we weren’t looking or asking for, but they opened the door for me to bring in emotional distress — for extreme outrageous and reckless infliction of emotional distress,” Lanier said, referring to the justices.
Lanier’s allegation of emotional distress stems in part from Harvard’s use of the daguerreotypes on a 2017 book cover and in promotional material for a 2014 conference, which were done without notifying Lanier.
University spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the ongoing lawsuit.
Koskoff wrote that while the ongoing lawsuit allows Lanier to pursue some forms of restitution for emotional distress, they maintain that the University should return the daguerreotypes.
“There’s no resolution of this case that doesn’t involve their turning over control of the daguerreotypes to the family,” Koskoff wrote.
“As long as they remain in Harvard’s captivity, the daguerreotypes of Renty and Delia shine a blinding light of hypocrisy on everything that Harvard does with respect to its entanglement with slavery and white supremacy,” he added.
The April 13 court date marks more than four years since Lanier first filed suit.
“Renty and Delia have waited over 170 years for their day in court, so we can be patient,” Koskoff wrote.
Correction: April 18, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly described Tamara K. Lanier’s emotional distress claim as a charge.

On the morning of Housing Day, blockmates Joey Liu ’26 and Alice Y. Yang ’26 awaited their Harvard undergraduate house assignment in anxious anticipation.
“I ran and got a Playa Bowl. I was ready, I was eating it, and then I got nervous. I couldn’t eat my Playa Bowl anymore, and I was really sad,” Liu said. “There was a lot of anxiety and nerves definitely when you’re waiting.”
“I was throwing up,” Yang added.
Liu and Yang’s fears of being “quadded” — placed in the traditionally less popular Radcliffe Quadrangle, which includes Pforzheimer, Currier, and Cabot Houses — magnified as they heard chants of “Pfoho” outside the room.
But when the door opened, enthusiastic residents from Leverett House met the blocking group instead, and the room erupted in cheers.
Freshmen woke up early Thursday morning to the sound of rowdy upperclassmen as they marched into Harvard Yard, waving signs and singing chants in celebration of Housing Day — an annual tradition where groups of freshmen are randomly assigned into one of the College’s 12 undergraduate houses.
The festivities began just before 8:30 a.m., when swarms of upperclassmen from each house flooded freshman halls — a tradition known as “dorm storming” — to welcome their house’s newest members.
On the eve of Housing Day, many College freshmen traverse the river houses in a ritual known as “River Run.”
The practice traditionally sees students take a shot of alcohol at each river house in an ill-fated bid to increase a group’s chances of avoiding the Quad, which is located roughly a mile from the River houses.
Jasdeep K. Gurm ’26 said she believes her River Run on the eve of Housing Day helped place her into Eliot House.
“It was beautiful,” Gurm said. “My friend ripped her pants in Eliot.”
Still, some quadded freshmen said they were pleased with their assignments.
Future Currier resident Necati O. Unsal ’26 said he felt “destined” for the Quad.
“I’m so happy about it. I’m overjoyed. It’s the best house,” he said. “The Quad is great. This is a win. I’m so proud.”
Vishnu S. Emani ’26, who was also placed into Currier, said he was going to be happy no matter which house he received.
“I feel a lack of agency in this matter, so I feel like I’m just excited no matter what. I feel like it’s just unconditional happiness,” said Emani, who is Unsal’s blockmate. “That’s the mindset I came into, and that’s the mindset I’m gonna leave with.”
Though Emma C. Rodriguiz ’26 admitted she was slightly disappointed to learn of her assignment to Currier, she said she was happy to defy expectations when she and her blocking group held back tears after hearing the news.
“We tried manifesting Lowell, but it didn’t work. Everything happens for a reason. We didn’t cry though; they were very impressed with that,” Rodriguez added, referring to the upperclassmen who delivered the news.
Alexis L. Monk ’26 said her blocking group was among the first in her dorm to learn of its housing assignment to Quincy House, a locale which she said “seems amazing.”
“We’re really excited about all the amenities at the house, and it seems like a great location, and most of our friends got right near us too, so we’re super pumped,” Monk said.
As one beloved part of the Housing Day planning process, House Committees compete for clout by releasing promotional music videos showcasing the house’s musical talent, group spirit, and amenities.
The tradition dates back to 2009 and has become a highly-anticipated part of Housing Day throughout the years. Lowell House’s 2013 Housing Day video, “Get Lowell,” has amassed more than 87,000 views on YouTube, while a 2019 Adams Housing Day video boasts roughly 76,000.
Cabot resident David P. Arena ’24 said he believes the quality of Housing Day videos had an appreciable effect on how students reacted to their assignments, particularly in the Quad.
“I think honestly, with the Quad Housing Day videos this year, I think we’ve seen a really big increase in how much freshmen want the Quad,” Arena said.
Quincy Housing Day Co-Chair Dominic J. Costa ’24 said he was tasked with editing Quincy’s video this year, which he described as “a lot of fun” but also “really stressful.”
“My role was really exhausting. I would say I spent a lot of long hours at night working on it. But it ends up being worth it because you get to premiere the results, and people almost always respond well as long as you put a lot of effort into it and show a lot of love for your house and community,” he said.
Traditionally, houses also sport clothing with creative designs that parody brands or pop culture or otherwise relate to house iconography.
This year, shirt designs included a Winthrop House “Casawinthrop” tee — a reference to the tequila brand “Casamigos” — and an Adams House shirt which parodied Jif’s logo, a reference to the house’s acorn mascot.
Emily Parke ’24, a Housing Day co-chair for Quincy, was responsible for handling freshman merch and coordinating activities on the big day. Parke said her planning started in January, when she began collecting ideas for house swag to gift freshmen on Housing Day.
Parke added that there was no relief for organizers in the days leading up to Housing Day, recalling a HoCo meeting in Quincy’s dining hall that “accidentally” lasted three hours.
Despite the many hours spent planning, Parke said it was worth it.
“I was up at 5:30 in the morning and getting doughnuts and everything for people in the house prior to dorm storming, but it was really, really fun,” she said.
Lowell HoCo Co-Chairs Jaya J. Nayar ’24 and Joseph E. Brower ’24 said they have been planning for Housing Day since their first meeting. Brower said their job — which he described as “running the circus” — was made easier by a team of committed Lowell residents.
Nayar said one of her favorite parts of Housing Day was walking with all the Lowell dorm stormers as they made their way to the Yard.
“Watching everybody walk together — and this massive pile of people just of our house, all in the same color, all friends with each other and laughing and yelling about the same thing — was a really magical experience,” she said.
After Housing Day, houses will continue with programming to help freshmen acclimate to house life. On Thursday night, houses opened their dining halls to their newest members for dinners, steins, and scavenger hunts.
Brower said Lowell has many events planned for freshmen through the end of the semester, including a talent show, open houses with the faculty deans, and a trivia night.
On Thursday, freshmen in Dunster were treated to a welcome ice cream bash after the house’s community night, and Quincy’s freshmen enjoyed a live performance from a swing band after dinner.
Nayar said she hopes freshmen attend as many HoCo events as possible.
“The housing community is what you make of it. You can choose to be as involved or as not involved as possible. And the more involved you get, the more this place feels like home,” she said.
Despite the Housing Day and Housing Day eve festivities, many classes — and even midterm examinations — proceeded as usual.
“I have a midterm in about two hours which I still have to study for,” Christopher B. Ruiz ’26 said shortly after receiving his assignment. “So it’ll be a little bit rough.”
Other students opted to take the day to process, like Rodriguiz, the future Currier resident.
“We need time to mentally recover,” Rodriguiz said Thursday morning. “So yes, we will be skipping. Excited for the free merch though. Gonna party in Currier tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics hosted a virtual panel Thursday on the impact of policy changes on the use of telehealth.
The discussion — titled “Achieving Telehealth’s Potential: The Federal Policy Landscape for Interstate Telehealth Practices” — was moderated by Carmel D. Shachar, an HLS lecturer and the executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center.
Four panelists spoke at the event, including Massachusetts Medical Society Director for Advocacy and Government Relations Leda Anderson, Sirona Strategies Partner Krista Drobac, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Deputy Director for Clinical Services Leonie K. Heyworth, and Rutgers University adjunct assistant professor Craig Lipset.
During the webinar, the panelists discussed the role of telehealth in modern medicine, particularly as its services have increased since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“What we know about telehealth is that it is an amazing extender for access to care,” Shachar said. “States — I think — took a look at how they could build a more flexible clinician workforce, especially with the pandemic not being evenly distributed across the country but sometimes coming in waves in the northeast or the southwest, for example.”
Still, as pandemic restrictions have eased, Shachar said policies enabling the large-scale use of telemedicine are now being rolled back.
“What we’re finding now as we come to the end of the federal public health emergency, which is one of the legal structures that has really allowed for this regulatory shift during the pandemic, is that, if anything, things are being walked back to pre-pandemic — that we’re going back to a very state-focused system,” Shachar said.
State medical boards — which are responsible for licensing, regulating, and disciplining physicians — play an important role in setting standards that promote health care quality, the panelists said.
“There’s value in the role of state medical boards in serving the public and keeping patients safe and ensuring quality medical care, by setting standards for the quality of care,” Anderson said.
But while physician licensing boards may standardize the quality of care, they can also limit access to virtual health services, according to Drobac.
“You are breaking the law if you practice in a state and are not abiding by the practice rules that have been set out by the medical board in that state,” Drobac said. “The idea that a medical board could police this better if they continue to require licensing, I think is false.”
“People are either going to do it anyway, or they’re going to get in their car and drive to a state where it’s legal,” Drobac said of medical practitioners.
The Veterans Affairs health care system — which allows its physicians to provide care across state borders — could serve as a model for integrating telehealth into nationwide systems, Heyworth said.
“And so really now what we’re looking at — looking forward to the expansion phase — is to be able to say, ‘How can this impact the type of care that we can deliver? How can we best leverage our capacity?’” she said. “‘How can we use that to improve quality of care, by leveraging that specialty expertise that might exist in some pockets and not another?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's lacrosse team defended Jordan Field on Saturday with a big win over the University of Vermont Catamounts. The victory marks the ninth-straight win for the Crimson on its home turf. Putting up decisive numbers with a 12-5 win, the young Crimson squad looked poised to continue its momentum into its game this upcoming weekend against the University of Michigan.
The matchup was advertised as being a tough meeting between the two teams because the squads play with completely different styles. The UVM team is led by a seasoned roster of grad students who play a slow and deliberate style of lacrosse. They run the clock down to the last few seconds and try to extend sets as much as possible, going through two or three rounds of offense to find the perfect take. The Crimson on the other hand is a young, fiery team that plays quickly and aggressively. The Crimson totaled 45 shots on goal to the Catamounts’ 33, a disparity that was due to both Harvard’s quick takes as well as lockdown defense.
A big area of improvement for the Crimson was down on the defensive end. The squad did a nice job locking down cutters, especially against the UVM attack which boasts several Canadian players who play tight on the inside, akin to a more traditional box-style offense. One standout, in particular, was first-year D-middie Owen Guest. Guest was crucial in locking down the alleys, ensuring that his matchups didn’t get a step on their dodges. Guest commented on the work the team had put in the previous week, and noted that communication and cohesiveness were two big aspects that contributed to the success.
“Coach Byrne has prepared us really well throughout the fall, as well as throughout this early spring. A point of emphasis this last couple of weeks has been guarding, and I think that it’s a confidence thing. We know our guys are going to slide behind us, so we can go up and confront guys,” Guest commented.
This confidence enabled the unit to perform well off-ball. When the one-on-one matchups were confidently locked down, the off-ball defenders were able to do more and make plays, not worried about their teammates getting beaten on the dodge. Junior LSM Greg Campisi attributed the team’s heads-up play down on the defensive end to this confidence. The squad was much more active, finding interceptions and lock-down doubles as a result.
“It comes from guarding because when we guard well we can do more stuff off-ball. We aren’t as worried about giving help here or there,” Campisi said. “It gives us a chance to be more aware of stuff going on off-ball and it all starts from there, from guarding.”
Vermont plays with a very unique Canadian style of offense, and Guest noted that reacting to their crafty style would be a focus for the team to work on this upcoming week in the lead-up to the game against the University of Michigan, a roster also boasts a few Canadian players.
“Playing a team like Vermont with a lot of Canadians and a lot of box players, I think we need to work on playing picks or chips because I think they exposed us once or twice on that. Michigan has a lot of experience with box players with [senior attacker Josh Zawada] and others who will be good at picking, so we’ve got to keep working on it,” Guest commented.
On the offensive end, senior attacker Hayden Cheek had a standout performance, tallying four goals. The offense, paralleling the defensive performance, was active this game, taking advantage of the ride in order to capitalize on more possession time.
“We knew that their goalie and defensemen weren’t great at handling the ball, and so we were looking for opportunities to go three down, and we turned the ball over a couple of times,” Cheek said.
The first quarter saw the offense go 2-2 with UVM, with the Crimson defense getting much of the action; the defense was able to lock down Vermont for an almost three-minute possession that saw the Catamounts held scoreless. On the offensive end, the Harvard team came out hot, shooting quickly and often with each possession. As the team settled in, the takes became more deliberate and decisive.
“We didn’t capitalize on our opportunities, and the goalie made some saves. The second quarter we settled down a little bit and made the easy play,” Cheek noted. “Our spacing was a lot better in the second quarter and we were beating our guys super easily and making them slide.”
Something that the offense will look to improve going into this weekend is its ability to pick apart a zone defense, and the defense will continue to work on rotations.
“We did a better job guarding –I think that was the most foundational thing in why we were successful today. But even then, there is still a lot we can do to get better,” Campisi said. “There are still times we got beat, there are still sometimes we gave up back-pipe looks … we are just trying to be the best we can be, and get better every week.”
Overall, the team looked much more fluid this game than the last. The attacking sets looked more cohesive, the defense worked as a solid unit, and the faceoff trios decisively controlled possessions. Confidence was key in this win, and the ability to play freely was essential on both ends of the field.
Campisi remarked that throughout the whole game, “we were trying to play freely. We weren’t trying to over-process and over-think. We were trying to play like we know how to.” This confidence will be a marker throughout the team’s practices this week, and will set the tone for how the squad takes the field this weekend coming off of two-straight wins on its home turf.
The men's lacrosse team will face off on Jordan Field against The University of Michigan Saturday at 12pm. The game will also be streamed live on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Kansas City, the big stage is ready.
In Cambridge, Truman L. Jones ’22 is too.
As the National Football League (NFL) prepares to welcome 260 new rookies to the uppermost echelon of professional football between April 27 and 29, one of Harvard’s best draft prospects in years is chasing a dream achieved by precious few.
Only 15 men have ever stood in the position that the six-foot-four, 242-pound defensive end may soon find himself in. Despite Harvard’s storied football history — boasting one of the best-winning percentages in all of Division I since 2000, including only one losing season — Jones could become just the 16th Crimson player to hear his name called on draft night, and the first since center Cole Toner ’16 in 2016.
After producing one of the best defensive seasons by a Harvard player in recent memory, that possibility is closer than ever to becoming reality.
“It was something that I aspired to, but I didn’t realize how close it was until the season after the [Covid-19] pandemic,” said Jones of playing in the NFL. “After that, just seeing how I performed, I really wanted to give my all to the game and put everything I had into it and just try to pursue playing at the next level.”
His elite senior season marked a remarkable rise for a player whose Harvard career began with a position change.
After a standout career at The Westminster Schools in Atlanta, in which he won a Division III-A state championship during his sophomore season, Jones entered veteran head coach Tim Murphy’s program as an outside linebacker. But after he saw action in just three of Harvard’s ten games during that 2018 season, Murphy and the rest of the Crimson’s staff decided to move him to defensive end.
“In that offseason, I probably, in three or four months, gained 20, 25 pounds,” Jones explained. “And then [I] was starting at defensive end that following year.”
That 2019 season proved to be the breakout that Jones needed to jumpstart his career. In his first start, a 36-14 win over San Diego, he made an instant impact, racking up 1.5 tackles for a loss, half a sack, and forcing a fumble. Throughout the year, he continued to wreak havoc on opposing players, racking up 23 tackles and finishing second in the Ivy League with 6.5 sacks despite missing the final three games of the season. His monster campaign earned him a Phil Steele All-Ivy Third Team nod.
When the Covid-19 pandemic canceled the 2020 season, Jones decided to take the fall semester off in order to study for the Medical College Admission Test, which also allowed him to play in the 2022 season. The biomedical engineering concentrator ultimately plans to go to medical school after his playing career is over. But, in the meantime, football came calling.
“It was a decision that took a lot of convincing my parents to make,” said Jones of opting to go on leave. “But once they understood that I had thought about it and had a game plan, they let me move forward with it.”
2021 represented somewhat of a setback, as his statistics failed to live up to the lofty standards that his sophomore campaign had set. After being tabbed as a likely All-Ivy First Teamer prior to the season, he notched just 25 tackles (4.5 for a loss) and two sacks, settling for a Fourth Team appearance on Phil Steele’s annual honors. But Jones was undeterred.
“I honestly knew that I still had the ability to have stats like I had in 2019,” he said. “I just had to devote myself to the game and play like I was earning my role as a starter again. … It also helped, being done with my major, biomedical engineering, so taking a lighter course load, having more free time in the afternoons to watch film, led to more focus on football, which led to a better season.”
In a somewhat disappointing 2022 season for a Harvard squad that went just 6-4 — including 1-4 at home — Jones was a bright spot. Serving as the team captain throughout the fall, the senior paced the Crimson with 13 tackles for a loss — which also tied for first in the Ivy League — six sacks, six quarterback hurries, and three blocked kicks. Perhaps indicative of his uncommon athleticism, the latter figure was good enough for fourth in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).
After the season, the awards rattled in.
All-Ivy First Team, unanimously. Academic All-Ivy. New England Football Journal First Team All-New England. FCS Associated Press Third-Team All-America. Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year. New England Defensive Player of the Year.
NFL teams took notice, too.
“Truman improved dramatically from freshman to senior year but it wasn’t until about halfway through his senior year that he became dominant and NFL scouts started paying attention,” Murphy wrote in an email.
“Definitely this year,” said former linebacker Jordan Hill ’21, who served as captain during the 2021 season, about when he knew that Jones had a chance to play in the NFL. “There’s a lot of moments when you say, ‘Okay, this guy is an NFL-caliber player.’”
Harvard has been fairly successful in producing NFL talent over the past 10 years. Running back Kyle Juszczyk ’13 was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in 2013, and, four years later, became the highest-paid fullback in league history when he signed a four-year, $21-million contract with the San Francisco 49ers. Tight end Cameron Brate ’13 won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. One of Jones’ teammates, running back Aaron Shampklin ’21, recently signed a futures/reserve contract with the Indianapolis Colts. And Hill himself participated in training camp with the eventual NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles prior to the 2022 season.
But none of these four players earned an honor that Jones did: he was the first Harvard player since NFL veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’04 to participate in the East-West Shrine Bowl, the nation’s premier collegiate football All-Star game, which invites some of the top seniors in the NCAA to compete in a week’s worth of practice and the game itself. From Jan. 27 to Feb. 7, Jones was in Las Vegas, training at the Las Vegas Raiders’ practice facility in front of NFL scouts alongside other potential pros.
“It didn’t really hit until being there, the caliber of players that I would see,” he said. “These are guys that I would watch on TV on Saturday, after our games had finished. So just seeing that they play what I thought was a higher level of football, but also meeting them in person, they’re normal guys that love the game and have a great appreciation for teamwork. I obviously learned a lot from them and their experiences and how they prepare and how they’re preparing to go to the next level, and I think it was a really great place for myself to prove that I can play with NFL-caliber players.”
Despite being the only Ivy League player at the showcase, Jones thrived in practice. A few weeks after the event, he was named to the All-West Practice Team. It also allowed him to gain exposure to a world in which football was the sole priority. In addition to the high-level talent, the teams were staffed with NFL coaches; the defensive coordinators for Jones’ West squad were a pair of New England Patriots assistants, cornerbacks coach Mike Pellegrino, and safeties coach Brian Belichick.
“They told us that this was kind of [our] audition for professional football, so, what will you do with all this free time, all the additional meeting time, all this additional coaching and resources that are available,” Jones said. “I really tried to take advantage of that and meet with coaches every day after practice, after film study, do extra work, watch film on my own, [and] get a good eight, nine hours of sleep.”
Jones’ hard work in practice paid off, as he got the opportunity to talk to, by his estimation, between 20 and 25 NFL franchises.
“Everybody needs a pass rusher and an outside linebacker,” said his agent, Joseph Linta of JL Sports Agency, which also represents Juszczyk, Brate, and Toner. “Everybody likes him, it’s just a matter of to what degree. Is someone going to like him enough to draft him? That remains to be seen.”
Despite his efforts, he still faces an uphill battle to hear his name called on draft night. Of the 319 players that the NFL invited to its annual Scouting Combine in Indianapolis from Feb. 28 to March 6, only one Ivy League representative was among them — Princeton wideout Andrei Iosivas. Instead, Jones had to prove himself at Harvard’s Pro Day on Thursday.
Murphy, Hill, Linta, and Jones all cited the defensive end’s athleticism and explosiveness as one of his strongest assets. With more than 20 NFL teams in attendance, he demonstrated why on Thursday, recording a 37-inch vertical jump that would have tied for the fourth-highest among defensive ends at the Scouting Combine. His 10-foot, two-inch broad jump would have tied for the tenth-longest among all edge prospects, and his 4.39-second performance in the shuttle run would have ranked fifth.
After his performance, Eric Galko, the Shrine Bowl’s Director of Football Operations and Player Personnel, tweeted: “It’d be surprising to me if he slips out of the draft.”
“Thought everything went very well,” Jones wrote in a text message. “Felt very explosive and athletic so happy with my showing.”
As the draft process has ramped up following the conclusion of his senior season, Jones has received plenty of support. JL Sports played a critical role in helping him earn his Shrine Bowl opportunity, and Linta helped connect him with Athletic Evolution, a training center in Wilmington, Mass., where he has made significant strides.
Jones has also been able to lean on Hill, who now works as a scout for the Cleveland Browns.
“It comes naturally to want to reach back when you see that guys are trying to do things and take it further than I could,” Hill said. “Obviously, he’s in this position because he is an NFL-caliber player, so it’s not like I need to tell him how to run fast or anything, but mainly just being a resource, somebody that he can lean on if he has questions about the process.”
For now, the process entails working and waiting. The draft is approaching in seven weeks, and Jones plans to be at home in Atlanta with his family and close friends, watching it on TV and hoping to hear his phone ring with a call from an NFL general manager.
“It would just be incredible to be picked in the draft and to be signed to a team,” he said. “It’s a short list of guys that have done that, so being able to do that puts your name in the history books with some pretty nice company.”
It is far from a guarantee that Jones will be drafted. But what is guaranteed is that he will keep working to perfect his craft.
People who know Jones well, including Murphy and Hill, rave about his character. Perhaps the best example of his humility and work ethic was his reaction to his stellar senior season.
His 2022 campaign, which led to his meteoric rise as a prospect, blew almost every football analyst’s expectations out of the water. But not Jones’.
“I can honestly say that I have never surpassed my own expectations,” he said. “I still have a lot to develop if I want to be successful at the next level.”

“The Harvard women’s water polo team is the cream of the crop in terms of talent, work ethic, motivation and drive,” said senior center Grace Thawley.
With an impressive 13-2 record, the Harvard women’s water polo team has had a fantastic start to its 2023 season. The Crimson are currently ranked #16 in the Week 8 Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) Poll and sit at #2 in the Ivy League, just below Princeton University.
In 2022, Harvard had the second-best season in program history, with a total of 23 wins and seven losses. The Crimson had four All-American selections as well, three of which have returned for the 2023 season: super seniors Evan Tingler, Zoe Banks, and Thawley
“Our team is really experienced and has been here for a lot of growth in the Harvard water polo program,” Banks said. “Our super seniors are a power to be reckoned with and are doing a lot to contribute to this season.”
The 2023 season marks Ted Minnis’ thirteenth year as head coach of the team. In 2022, Minnis was named the CWPA Coach of the Year for the second time.
“The women are working really hard in and out of the pool,” Minnis commented. “Watching film, getting after it in conditioning sets and in the weight room — I'm very proud of how much this team has grown over the last four weeks.”
After falling to the University of Michigan in the 2022 CWPA Championship, the Crimson are looking to claim the conference title this season.
“Our quote for the season is ‘commit to excellence’,” Banks said. “I think all of us are going in with the goal of bringing a good mindset to practice every day, working as hard as we possibly can every day, and seeing how far it takes us — we are coming together to commit to doing whatever it takes to win the championship.”
This past weekend, the Crimson held the Harvard Invitational at Blodgett Pool. It went 4-0, defeating three higher ranked opponents — Brown, Wagner, and CSUN — increasing its record to a perfect 9-0 at home. Harvard believes that its games against Wagner and Brown were two of its strongest performances so far this season.
“We lost to Brown last year, and I know the girls really wanted to bring the heat back — having a solid win against them was awesome,” Thawley reflected. “It was evident that we weren't just going through the motions — we weren't being robotic. We were focused on reading our options in the pool and in our offense.”
“Our defense was well prepared and we got a lot of stops. We didn't let them score a lot of goals. [Wagner and Brown were] two well-rounded games that proved to us that we're really improving,” the senior center added.
The Crimson will travel to Arizona State University this weekend to play in the ASU Invitational before heading off to California to face off against Berkeley, University of the Pacific, and Santa Clara University.
“This spring break is gonna be even more exciting after the success we saw this weekend. The team is fired up to continue to improve and show that we are capable of beating teams that are ranked above us,” Thawley said.
Banks added that, “What I take away from spring break empowers me even more for the rest of the season. We all learn a lot from every single game and practice that we have.”
After spring break, the team will compete in a series of Ivy games, four of which will be hosted at Blodgett Pool. Now at the halfway point of its 2023 season, the Crimson is determined to do whatever it can to claim the CWPA Championship title this season.

Oh, you haven’t heard of Cabot Café? That’s embarrassing. Let me catch you up. Have a seat. I assume wherever you just sat down in Lowell or Adams or Dunster or any of those boring, subpar houses is about 1,000 times less comfortable than the worst seat in Cabot Café on a bad day.
Cabot Café, to put it humbly, is a place of magic. Cabot Café had good vibes before Pinterest ever said good vibes. I don’t even live in Cabot, and I’m in the Cabot Housing Day video saying “GO CABOT” in Cabot Café.
Allow me to explain. Cabot Café is a fully student-run, late night coffee shop that is tucked quietly into Cabot House E-Entryway, just past the dhall. It’s open every night except Fridays from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., might I say THE perfect hours for a work grind session or light tomfoolery (choose your destiny).
Picture this: you walk into Cabot Café, at which point you are greeted by the extremely friendly baristas. Any worries you may have are immediately quelled by the immaculately hung string lights, the whiteboards that have the perfect balance of decorated chaos and order, and the natural light chatter that is comforting without being distracting. You hear the background music, which is personalized by the baristas every night. You see that, if you so choose, you can add to the Spotify playlist to hear whatever you’re in the mood for.
You have your choice of any drink your heart might desire. The whiteboard offers every flavor of coffee (including my personal favorite — the mocha, for which they just made a new and improved recipe). Clear bins of all different flavors of tea line the back wall. There’s even the option for a lemonade, or other flavorful drinks if you’re feeling more adventurous. AND if you’re feeling hungry, feel free to indulge in a Hot Pocket or some classic mac ’n cheese.
You are now fed, watered, or caffeinated, and have your choice to sit at any of the couches of varying sizes. You can tuck yourself into the couch and chair arrangement in the back corner, where there are bookshelves full of knick-knacks. Or, you can choose your flavor of table and sit at one of the longer tables, the more humble round table, or the smaller, individual tables along the wall. And before you ask, there are outlets in every nook and cranny. I can’t make this up.
If I haven’t quite drilled it home yet, let’s just say there’s nothing more exciting than CabCaf-related notifications. Email from CabCaf saying they have a new mac ’n cheese recipe and are bringing back for-here mason jars and mugs. Boom — it’s like Christmas morning. Text in the roommate group chat: “Roll CabCaf tonight?” Best news of the week.

And before you river people say that walking to Cabot Café is just too far, remember that it’s the same as the average Quadling walking to Widener to do work for the night. YOU CAN DO IT. No excuses — bring a friend and give CabCaf some love!!!
