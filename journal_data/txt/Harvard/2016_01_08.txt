After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Bright-Landry Center will be a sweet sight for the road-weary No. 5/4 Harvard men’s hockey team. The last time the Crimson suited up in the comfort of its own home was on Nov. 7, exactly two months prior to the team’s Thursday night tilt with No. 11/11 Boston University.
“It’s nice to get back and play some games at home, especially against a cross-town rival,” junior forward Tyler Moy said.
But the Crimson would like for nothing more than to play at home just as it did on the road.
After dropping the first game of its latest road trip to now-No. 2/1 Quinnipiac, Harvard (8-1-3, 4-1-3 ECAC) did not lose any of the remaining six games of its roadstand, outscoring opponents by a margin of 26-11. Its last game was perhaps its most impressive performance—a 4-3 overtime win in a hostile Minnesota arena to take the 25th annual Mariucci Classic.
“Those are the games we want to be playing in at the end of the season—those high-pressured games,” Moy said. “All of these games are going to be very close…. It was a good test playing in their barn.”
While co-captain Jimmy Vesey has been the one to receive Hobey Baker hype on the Crimson, it has been fellow co-captain Kyle Criscuolo that has stolen the show as of late. The winger has scored four times in the team’s last four games, including twice against the Gophers—once with 34 seconds left in regulation to force overtime, and again in overtime to clinch the tourney. The last goal put him at 10 on the year—one above Vesey.
While the leadership duo is the clear 1-2 punch in terms of goal-scoring, the rest of the team has provided a balanced attack. Nine other skaters have beat the goalie on multiple occasions this year, including freshman Ryan Donato, who missed the weekend’s Mariucci Classic while playing for Team USA at the World Junior Championships yet has four goals on the year.
“I think all season we’ve done a good job of trying to cover a lot of aspects [of our game],” Moy said. “We’re just trying to stay sharp.”
On the other hand, the Terriers (9-6-3, 4-3-2 Hockey East) want nothing more than to turn over a new leaf in 2016 for the second half of its season. While the team has played well in the first half of the season, BU has been plagued with off-the-ice issues that have overshadowed its actual accomplishments.
Junior forward Nick Roberto will not suit up for the Terriers this year after playing in every game last year. The third-year winger was suspended for the remainder of the season for alleged gambling, which is not allowed per NCAA rules. Then, sophomore forward A.J. Greer took his talents to the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League after regularly suiting up on the third line for coach Dan O’Quinn. Injuries to top players have exacerbated the impact of his departure, including one to senior Ahti Oksanen, who has found twine a team-leading nine times this season.
The Terriers hope that the additions of freshmen Oskar Andren and Erik Udahl—who just in the past few weeks came to the team via the NAHL and BCHL, respectively—can add a spark to the offense. But even without these two newcomers, BU has made its presence known—the Terriers handed Quinnipiac its only loss of the year in Hamden, Conn., in its last game of 2015.
“We know it’s a very good team and they had a lot of success last year obviously,” Moy said. “It’s a good matchup to test ourselves against another really good team.”
If last year was any litmus test for this year’s game, skaters from both squads might have to prepare for more than 60 minutes of play. Both of the matchups from last season went to overtime, including a double-OT thriller in which BU forward Danny O’Regan, the Terriers’ leading assist-man this season, eliminated the Crimson in the first round of the Beanpot.
“I think our guys will be excited,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91 said. “I don’t think we have to give a lot of speeches to get up for playing against BU. Our guys enjoy that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 55 minutes, it looked as if the No. 5/4 Harvard men’s hockey team would be able to notch a statement win against its crosstown rival, No. 11/11 Boston University.
In the blink of an eye, it all slipped away.
Three Terrier goals over a 129-second span turned a comfortable two-goal lead for the Crimson into a one-goal deficit. BU associate captain Ahti Oksanen managed to find space in the slot and beat sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen just over the left pad with less than two minutes remaining to complete the furious Terrier comeback, bringing the predominantly BU crowd to its feet.
“They’re an excellent team, and I think they showed that,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think there were times later in the game where we needed to respect that fact….and we didn’t enough, and that’s why it came back to bite us.”
Halfway through the third, the Crimson’s most potent goal-scoring duo connected to push Harvard’s cushion to 5-3 on a goal that seemed to put the Crimson (9-2-3, 4-1-3 ECAC) in cruise control for the rest of the tilt. Senior forward Jimmy Vesey skated behind the net and found classmate Kyle Criscuolo streaking in front of the crease, and Vesey’s fellow co-captain beat senior goaltender Sean Maguire glove-side to answer a Danny O’Regan goal that had cut the lead to one just three minutes prior.
But with 4:11 left in the contest, fifth-year senior Colin Blackwell incurred an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty along the boards that awoke the Terrier offense. BU (11-6-3, 4-3-2 Hockey East) capitalized on the ensuing power play, as captain Matt Grzelcyk cut the deficit to one with just 13 seconds into the man advantage on a slapshot from the point.
Less than a minute later, O’Regan stunned the Harvard bench with an equalizer. The Needham, Mass., native received a pass from defenseman Charlie McAvoy on the doorstep and calmly put it in the back of the net with Madsen drawn out of the crease by the defenseman from Long Beach, N.Y. Just over a minute later, Oksanen notched the game-winner.
“You just watched the game evolve, and we got better as the game went on,” BU coach David Quinn said.
O’Regan has a knack for scoring timely goals against the Crimson. The former Roxbury Latin standout delivered the game-winner in the 2015 Beanpot semifinals to eliminate his brother Tommy O’Regan ’15 from the annual tournament in his final season at Harvard.
“Danny O’Regan is a very talented guy,” Donato said. “He can pass the puck, he can score. He’s dangerous.”
The Crimson was unable to respond late as it did in Minnesota last Saturday to force an overtime period. Criscuolo found space streaking towards the net and tried to find Vesey in the waning seconds, but Vesey could not maintain possession, and the puck sailed out of the attacking zone just prior to time expiring.
“I had no clue what to expect tonight—the last game we played was the 12th of December,” O’Quinn said. “We haven’t had a practice as a full team for almost a month.... But we got better and better and stayed in the moment.”
Harvard’s response to Terrier goals was much different in the first half of the game.
Two times on the night, BU closed one-goal deficits on relatively weak scoring chances, with Madsen letting a weak wrister from Matt Lane slip through his legs to open the scoring for the Terriers in the second frame. On both occasions, however, junior forward Sean Malone stole the lead back within a minute of BU’s equalizers to push the Crimson back in front for the time being.
The Sabres prospect crashed the net on a rebound for his first and received a pass in front of the net from junior forward Tyler Moy for his second after the Nashville prospect drew multiple defenders with his drive towards net.
Harvard opened the game controlling the flow of the puck on offense, not allowing BU to register a shot on goal for the first 15 minutes of play. But despite the 18-2 shot differential in the first 20 minutes, the Crimson only managed one goal—a putback off the back boards from Vesey, his 10th of the season.
“Their goaltender made some enormous saves early on to keep the game within one or two,” Donato said. “I give them credit—they stuck with it and found a way.”
Harvard was unable to keep this pace for the rest of the game, however. The Terriers outshot the Crimson 20-8 in the third period to pull out the victory, snapping Harvard’s seven-game unbeaten streak.
