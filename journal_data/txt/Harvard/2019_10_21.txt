After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last decade, the entirety of the cinematic genre has changed. Marvel movies dominate box offices. Science fiction and fantasy films have moved from being nerdy and unpopular to the most prominent and successful films of the year. Hell, even “Star Wars“ is back and making millions. The silver screen is completely saturated with sci-fi.
But, as it has been for more than 50 years, “Star Trek” is still present on the small screen. In 2020, marking 53 years for the franchise, a new “The Next Generation” derivative will begin airing with the simple title “Picard,” after the famed Federation Captain Jean-Luc Picard played by Patrick Stewart, who will return in the titular role.
As series are rebooted and remade, the quality tends to suffer. A great example is the most recent iteration of the “Star Trek“ movies. With Chris Pine at the helm of the USS Enterprise, it seemed as if nothing could go wrong. The Romulans were defeated, Spock was saved, and it seemed as if The Federation was finally in time of peace. But the second iteration, and even more so the third, reused plot lines, strayed from the norms of the series, and ultimately left it without a true conclusion. Hopefully the same doesn’t happen to “Picard.”
With a fandom unlike many other shows, “Star Trek,” and specifically “The Next Generation,” brings together people across generations to enjoy what was a hit science fiction shows in the U.S. As “Picard” takes up the mantle alongside the other airing “Star Trek” shows “Discovery” and “Short Treks,” it has mighty shoes to fill. One aspect of this show stands apart from other off-shoots. This show, almost 25 years after its source material ended production, somehow managed to retain a large portion of its original cast. With some of the main roles being reprised by the original cast, and Patrick Stewart working as an Executive Producer, the show has promise and a chance to recreate what so many loved all those years ago.
“Picard” will undoubtedly challenge what many think about the “Star Trek” franchise but hopefully, with this first trailer in mind and serving as inspiration for what could be a phenomenal, exciting, and simply entertaining show, it will also serve as a new launching ground for exciting, authentic shows. Although Patrick Stewart and crew cannot make up for the creative genius of Gene Roddenberry, the newest “Star Trek” iteration rests in good hands and appears to be something to look forward to.

In the weeks leading up to the release of Todd Phillips’ most recent film “Joker,” almost all the news coverage of the film focused on controversy. There were Phillips’ comments on creating comedy in “woke culture”; the question of whether or not convicted pedophile Gary Glitter would receive royalties from his song being used in the film; and perhaps most importantly, the conversation of whether or not the film glorifies mass murder.
Critics and audiences have generally received the film positively, praising the performance of Joaquin Phoenix and the interesting development of the titular character’s backstory. However, before it hit theaters, the families of the victims of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado signed a letter that was sent to Warner Brothers, cautioning them about the film and encouraging them to donate to gun-control charities.
The 2012 shooting took place during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises,” another film that depicted DC’s Joker, and rumors circulated that the shooter referred to himself as “The Joker.” While the film was not screened in that same theatre, concerns were raised about the film promoting “incel culture” and giving a super-villain character a sympathetic backstory.
Many are concerned that people who identify with those traits, or the film, might be inspired to imitate the actions of the Joker. In the event that those actions occur, should Phillips or anyone else who worked on the production of “Joker” be held responsible?
What always needs to be considered is intent. Phillips is not intending to promote violence through his film — he is intending to demonstrate the complicated backstory of one of the most complex characters in pop culture history.
While it is important to ensure their audience is aware of their intent, a mistranslation of it can’t hold the artist entirely accountable. Interpretative and provocative art needs a place to exist without censorship due to concerns over the possible responses of the audience. The man who killed John Lennon identified with J. D. Salinger’s “The Catcher in the Rye.” “Helter Skelter” by the Beatles was never intended to incite violence, but Charles Manson used it as a vehicle to mass murder, for which the Beatles cannot possibly be considered responsible.
After all, “Joker” doesn’t paint the Joker as a hero; he is a deeply broken man who takes extreme and horrible actions against others. Phillips doesn’t paint those actions in any other light, and it’s his intention that the audience sees them in that same light as well.

The Netflix hit “Queer Eye” has tasked the Fab Five, a group of gay professionals specializing in food, culture, fashion, interior design, and personal grooming, with transforming lives (while producing tear-inducing content) in Georgia, Missouri, and now… Japan? On Oct. 7, Netflix released a trailer for “Queer Eye: We’re in Japan,” a special four-episode season based in Tokyo set to be released on Nov. 1.
The very premise of such a venture raises a myriad of questions beyond “Can I afford to spend four hours on November first watching ‘Queer Eye?’” The show previously released a 20-minute special filmed in a town called Yass, Australia, on Youtube, perhaps due to the similarity between the town’s name and the slang phrase “yass queen” (number of a’s and s’s variable), but even that international experience is far from a full mini-season in Japan. It doesn’t seem like any member of the Fab Five has any particular familiarity with Japanese culture or language. Throughout the trailer they speak to the nominees in English while nominees respond in Japanese. The trailer introduces their Japanese guests Kiko Mizuhara and Naomi Watanabe, and the show’s team surely has plenty of translators, but the constant interruption of deep, personal conversations with translation ruins their gravity.
Further, cultural elements like fashion, beauty, and certainly food would differ significantly. There are also real differences in the norms of personal expression, interpersonal norms, and societal values. Certainly a lack of effort and self esteem (which is often the problem) is a universal phenomenon and Tan’s infamous French tuck could make anyone look good, but it would also strike the wrong way if the Fab Five gave the same advice to a young Japanese man in Tokyo as they would to a Caucasian man in Kansas City. The trailer makes a point about “connecting cultures,” and the potential for cultural exchange and mutual growth that already takes place on the show is extraordinary. Hopefully, the show will be able to strike a balance between highlighting cultural differences and celebrating the more universal pieces of the human experience while “transforming” the lives of their four nominees.
It will also be interesting to see how/whether the show will bring up discussions of LGBTQ+ acceptance in Japan, a country that has not legalized gay marriage. Part of the original premise of “Queer Eye” is to bring queerness to spaces in which it often isn’t well represented and to prompt humanizing conversations to deepen understanding and empathy. The trailer doesn’t show any hint of these dialogues, but once again, the potential is extraordinary and it would almost feel like a copout not to have them.
All this said, the mini season does look like it will be an adorable, emotional ride like every other season of the show thus far. Sure, the opening in which Tan asks if the other guys are ready in Japanese is just a little more cringey than the multiple shots of them dancing through an intersection, but with just a few brief glimpses into the lives of the nominees, viewers are already invested. After all, you had me at, “I want to transform from a rock to a psychedelic flower” (which, honestly, don’t we all?).

It’s a story many students will find familiar. You sit in the library, doing your assigned readings, and notice yourself stumbling over the same few sentences. You re-read them but you’re still perplexed; the author uses advanced terms without explaining what they mean, and structures his sentences in the least straightforward way imaginable. You read them again. Once you finally feel that you understand the message, you’re crushed by the discovery that the next paragraph is even more confusing than the last.
If this sounds like you, don’t worry — you are not the problem. If the purpose of academic writing is to clearly communicate one’s ideas and research to the reader, then writing that is difficult to understand is bad writing. Period.
Many academic papers skip the process of defining basic terms and concepts; perhaps the authors assume that their work will only be read by other scholars in their field. But on the other end of the academic spectrum are “popular” works, which try to make some area of study understandable (and interesting) to the public. The movie “Hidden Figures,” for example, is a work of popular history, because it tells the story of the African American women who helped America’s space program in an engaging and easy-to-grasp way.
If the goal of our university system is to foster a well-educated public, not just to create a class of intellectual elites, then scholars who produce academic papers should be grateful to their peers who create “popular” works of academia. Unfortunately, this is seldom the case. In many areas of scholarship, it’s commonplace to find a divide between “academics” and “popularizers,” where the former is often dismissive or condemnatory of the latter. For example, I was recently warned that a particular source in the history of science had received criticism for being “too much of a popular history.”
This makes no sense. If we take a random popular history book off the shelf, then there are many valid critiques that could potentially apply to it. Maybe the book oversimplifies the facts, or it creates a false narrative in order to make history seem more interesting. However, it would be invalid to say the book is bad merely for being a work of “popular history.”
We should praise authors who want to make history, science, and philosophy accessible to the public. We can suggest that they refine their methods, but we should be supportive of their goal. Instead, many academics seem to dismiss the popularization of their fields as a useless, risky pursuit.
I think there are two potential reasons for this. The first is academic elitism. If you’re one of the world’s only scholars on the Flemish goose, then you’d naturally feel some pride in possessing a set of knowledge that very few people have. So, you might disapprove of a popular science book on the Flemish goose, as this would spread that knowledge to many people who weren’t originally part of your small club of academic goose-lovers.
But, let’s be generous and assume that elitism isn’t the main cause for the academic-popularizer divide. Then, the only remaining reason for a scholar to oppose popular works is if they sincerely believe that academic fields can only be popularized through the use of major rhetorical or analytical flaws.
To some academics, the idea of making a subject “understandable” is synonymous with making it deceptively oversimplified. I wholeheartedly disagree. Converting an academic subject into something that the public can understand is not easy, but it’s certainly possible. Communicating complex truths without being misleading requires skill and subtlety; rather than create some easy answer, you’ll need to be honest with your listener about the things that confuse even the foremost intellectuals in your field. Some academics might think that this is too much for the public to handle, but I believe that the average person is a lot smarter than scholars give them credit for.
Above all, scholars need to understand that humans have the natural tendency to view simpler arguments as more convincing. In 2015, U.S. Senator Jim M. Inhofe (R-OK) brought a snowball into Congress, essentially suggesting that global warming was a hoax because it was cold outside. This (familiar) argument is extremely simple, which, for many people, makes it especially convincing. Those of us who wish to defend climate science are left with two options: Counter a simple lie with a 97-page research paper full of terms like the “albedo effect,” or counter a simple lie with an easy-to-understand version of the truth.
To me, the choice is clear. In order to get people to listen, we need scholars who are skilled at translating complex ideas into accessible language. Harvard students are especially fortunate, as the quality of our education is unparalleled. For this reason, we should try to share what we learn with as many people as possible, whether we do it through making videos, articles, or even intelligent Twitter threads. Once we free ourselves from the notion that academic knowledge can only be communicated through esoteric research papers, then we realize that every day offers us the opportunity to help educate (and learn from) those around us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After four years of extensive administration efforts to address sexual assault, the results from the student survey on sexual assault and misconduct, a product of the Association of American Universities, are in — and the statistics haven’t changed. Almost a third of Harvard undergraduate women reported having experienced nonconsensual sexual contact — the upper bound of the reported national range.
As students of the University, we are saddened and horrified that in the past four years there has been no statistically significant movement in the fight against sexual violence on our campus. The responsibility to propel cultural change falls all members of our community. We implore the University to reevaluate both its administrative policies as well as the culture it perpetuates so that it not only seeks change, but achieves it.
To some extent, these statistics reflect a broader rape culture endemic to American society, but we cannot allow that to excuse our actions and the community we are all responsible for building. Here are two tangible ways the University and its affiliates might address these issues:
Firstly, the University should modify current programming and trainings aimed at combating sexual misconduct on campus to incorporate statistics from this sexual misconduct survey and personal narratives from affected students. Many of our peers have written bravely about their experiences with sexual misconduct on campus, and have detailed the ways in which trauma stemming from these experiences has deeply impacted them. We believe combining the presentation of these narratives with these disturbing statistics will serve to both humanize and raise the stakes of the issue.
Secondly, all Houses should standardize party safety trainings and require that hosts undergo training for alcohol safety, sexual violence, and bystander prevention. As we have previously opined, there are marked disparities in culture between Houses, and while we laud individual Houses and House leaders who have worked hard to produce tight-knit, safe, and open communities, the College needs to consider how to bring those advances to the rest of the College. Issues of gender-based and sexual misconduct and violence are no exception.
Beyond the specifics of these issues, it bears mentioning that these statistics may not tell the whole story. For many, completing the survey this past April may have been traumatic and as a result, some individuals may not have taken it to completion. It may not therefore be fully representative of the community as a whole and all those who have experienced inappropriate and violent behavior.
Furthermore, the survey highlights the fact that many undergraduates still do not feel comfortable coming to the University with concerns related to sexual misconduct, despite being aware of the resources they may turn to. While the recently released anonymous online Title IX reporting form Harvard may begin to address the problem, the University should evaluate why reporting mechanisms already in place have not been working. The decades during which figures like Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. and former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez were able to engage in “unwelcome sexual conduct” on campus speaks to the depth of the difficulties in reporting such actions. We call on Harvard to consider the aspects of its processes that allow power dynamics, undermining language, and a fear of retaliation to discourage people from reporting sexual misconduct on campus, and to work rigorously to rectify these shortcomings.
Surveys only yield information; statistics are not solutions. Harvard — its administration and broader community — must prioritize the issue the AAU survey brings to light. That begins with University policy, but it also requires the effort, self-reflection, and courage of all Harvard affiliates.
We will continue to advocate such change until we realize what we all know to be true: Our Harvard can do better.

“It almost paralyzes you. This fear of writing.”
My therapist made this observation at the end of this past summer as I explained why I was scared to return to school and really confront the thesis I had been avoiding for months. While I’ve already written a bit about how scary writing can feel, the stakes feel much higher now that I have to turn in a full project in just over four months. This thesis feels like more than just a project to wrap up my college career. I see it as a test-run to get an idea of whether or not I would be able to handle graduate school.
I’ve developed a more serious relationship with writing since I left STEM a little over two years ago. My view of writing shifted in my head as it became a part of my career — feeling more real as I felt more power in what I could put down on paper. However, with that empowerment through writing comes more pressure to produce engaged scholarship, and more pressure to produce coherent arguments that I can defend.
Advisors have pointed out the insecurity that comes across in my writing when it appears I am not even convinced myself by what I’m saying. I’ve been encouraged to take pride in my work when I’m advised to keep on writing or get positive feedback on my articles. But I still have a hard time making it stick. It still takes an active effort to remind myself I should feel proud of my work.
I think about the way the fear paralyzes me every time I write something I know will be public. I think about it every time I write a new piece. I am thinking about it as I write this one. I worry people won’t like it. I worry I’ll accidentally say something wrong or that I’ll realize I’m actually not that good. After all, I’m the same insecure immigrant child who thought she wasn’t smart when her friends with college-educated parents used words she couldn’t understand.
Most importantly, I fear I won’t do my communities justice. I fear this Harvard name has distanced me from my people as I recognize the past — and current — harm academics from elite institutions have committed in studying our communities. I worry my work won’t be accessible, reproducing the same college-educated language I wasn’t able to understand before coming here.
But then I am reminded of my position within this institution. I am reminded that my work won’t be taken seriously and that I will have to fight for it to be heard. I am reminded of the hateful comments I’ve received on my pieces in the past, which I expect to continue scrolling past.
I remember why I am writing. I remember why it’s so important to have people like me doing research and becoming professors for future students to see themselves represented in ways I haven’t seen myself represented enough.
The quote in my byline above comes from Gloria Anzaldúa’s letter to third-world women writers. She reminds me that we have a harder time feeling confident in our writing while white men write carefreely and neglect to acknowledge our work, passing us up as academics and experts in our own fields. By reading her work, my fear of writing makes more sense to me. It assures me that writers’ blocks are normal and that it does not mean we should give up or that we’re not good enough.
As I struggle to reconcile my position as an outsider within, I hope I can do my communities justice with the opportunities I have access to at this institution. Anzaldúa’s work reminds me that we should be the ones in charge of our narratives and our scholarship. We are not imposters in our writing. We can and should be more than just the subjects of our academic fields.

Harvard's Undergraduate Council confirmed that its president and vice president can vote and sponsor legislation at its general meeting Sunday.
The Sunday meeting put an end to a months-long period of uncertainty, during which the president and vice president had to start each meeting with asking council members for permission to vote in that particular meeting. The proposal to allow the president and vice president to vote and sponsor legislation passed 34-4-2.
Representatives first questioned whether the president and vice president had the power to vote and sponsor legislation in April due to an ambiguity in the council’s constitution. The constitution refers to the president and vice president as “executive officers” rather than “representatives,” which some argued suggests they cannot vote. The constitution also lacks language explicitly preventing the president and vice president from voting, according to Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who chaired the council’s Rules Committee last year.
At its final meeting last semester, the council voted to establish a new committee with the power to interpret the constitution. That committee decided to strip the president and vice president of their voting rights and ability to sponsor legislation.
Enough representatives changed their votes after the meeting, however, to annul the committee’s establishment, leaving the president’s and vice president’s powers in the council uncertain.
Mather House representative Conner P. Williams ’21, who currently chairs the council’s Rules Committee, sponsored the legislation Sunday to formally recognize the president and vice president as “full members” of the council with the ability to vote and sponsor legislation.
Williams said that according to the UC’s archives, the president and vice president have maintained voting rights on the council since its inception.
Many representatives said they supported the legislation because they believe the president and vice president should have membership rights so they can execute the platform they ran on.
“I think it’s important that the president and vice president are able to introduce legislation and are able to have a voice on the council,” said Lowell House representative Rachel L. Reynolds ’22, who is also a Crimson blog editor.
Dunster House representative Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20 noted the presidential election has historically had the highest turnout of all elections for UC representatives.
“If people want the policies that the president and vice president were suggesting in their platform, that’s why they elected them, and that’s why those policies should be implemented,” Krishnan-Jha said.
Current President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 said they agree they need the ability to vote and sponsor legislation to do their job effectively.
“The ability for the President and VP to sponsor legislation and vote is paramount not only to the execution of platform points that they were elected to push forth, but also to the effective representation of student interests on the UC and at Harvard more broadly,” Palaniappan and Huesa wrote in a statement.
Some representatives said they opposed the legislation because it would perpetuate what they see as an imbalance of power on the council.
“My main issue is with the president and vice president voting,” Adams House representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 said. “It does give whatever Houses the president and vice president are in an extra vote.”
Each House has three representatives on the council, but the president and vice president do not count toward this limit, according to the body’s constitution.
UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, who also voted against the proposal, said he is concerned that council members would be overly eager to vote for legislation sponsored by the president and vice president.
“There’s something different in nature about being the president than being a representative,” said Palmer, who is also a former Crimson sports chair.
The UC also passed a proposal 34-5-2 that would place all internal rules-related legislation after other docketed legislation in meeting agendas. Adams House representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22 and Leverett House representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22 sponsored the legislation because they said that in previous years, the council spent too much time at the beginning of meetings debating rules-related proposals instead of legislation that directly affects their constituents.
The Council also unanimously voted to renew its Grant for an Open Harvard College, which funds events that address one of the council’s “compelling interests” which include social life, financial accessibility, harassment prevention, and mental health. This year, the interest of “race relations” will be changed to “cultural and racial initiatives” in order to promote diversity in a broader sense, according to Dunster House representative Noah Harris ’22, who also chairs the Finance Committee.

United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights and former President of Chile Michelle Bachelet spoke about her work to uphold fundamental human rights around the world at the Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum Friday.
Mathias Risse, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, moderated the event. He began the discussion by stressing the importance of Bachelet’s role in working to solve human rights crises, citing increasing xenophobia in Europe, refugees, and the state of religious freedom under authoritarian regimes as examples.
During her speech, Bachelet contextualized her work by focusing on how it relates to modern day trends, like the movement toward nationalism.
“It is precisely at this moment of growing complexity and interconnectedness that some leaders are turning away from cooperative solutions,” Bachelet said. “Nationalism is on the rise in our society, accompanied by outspoken racism, discrimination.”
She also discussed how digitalization impacts human rights violations, calling digital tools “extremely helpful to the human rights world” while also noting “a dark side to the digital landscape.”
Bachelet cited examples of data streams used to track and interrupt human trafficking as well as government surveillance tools to target and track political dissidents or marginalized groups like the BGLTQ community.
In his introduction, Risse recognized Bachelet’s work as the inaugural executive director of UN Women, a UN group founded in 2011 to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment. He also spoke about her efforts to reach gender parity in the Chilean cabinet and equal pay legislation she championed.
Bachelet noted there is still a lot of work to be done in the gender equality sphere despite her accomplishment.
“Women continue to be poorer than men,” she said. “They have fewer opportunities, less access to basic services such as education, and a lot less freedom to make their own choices.”
After Bachelet and Risse finished their remarks, audience members asked Bachelet about what her office has done to address the migrant crisis or uphold Venezuelan migrants’ rights.
Bachelet said her office focuses on advocating on behalf of marginalized people to national governments but does not “impose” on them. She added that she believes there needs to be more evaluation of the root causes in the case of the Venezuela crisis.
“Humanity has always migrated,” she said. “No one wants to leave their home, the place they were born, where they were raised, or where their great-grandparents are buried. It is because of an extreme need.”
Attendee Emmet A. Halm ’23 said he enjoyed the event, though he acknowledged the limits of the work Bachelet’s office does.
“I thought some of the criticism of the UN’s actions in general toward Venezuela and Myanmar were pretty valid,” he said. “But I think she made a good point in that her job is separate from the politics of the UN.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig and political consultant Stuart Stevens considered the major issues with the current Electoral College system at a luncheon hosted by Lessig and the Harvard Law and Policy Review Saturday.
As a Republican political consultant, Stevens worked on several presidential campaigns, including former President George W. Bush’s campaign in 2000 and Sen. Mitt Romney’s (R-Utah) campaign in 2012. A constitutional law and ethics expert, Lessig ran and lost the bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential race.
Stevens opened the conversation by arguing against the Electoral College and saying it only valued the votes of swing states and white voters.
Stevens — a Republican — said he believes the Electoral College is allowing the Republican Party to operate as a “whites only” party. He said the Republican Party ignores growing minority voting blocs and strictly targets white voters, which he fears will hurt the party in future elections.
“Abolishing the Electoral College is vital to the survival of the Republican Party,” Stevens said at the luncheon.
Lessig also reiterated Stevens’s concern about the Electoral College’s tendency to value swing states and considered possible alternatives and solutions to the current system.
Lessig advocated for dividing electoral votes into fractions, a process known as fractional proportional allocation of votes. He said the process would require states to choose a candidate from the Democratic and Republican parties and divide the Electoral College votes proportionally between them based on the fraction of popular vote they received.
Lessig said this system would solve the problem of overvaluing swing state voters, who are often “older, whiter” and less representative of changing demographics in the country.
Lessig has advocated for reform of the American electoral system in the past. In 2014, Lessig founded a political action committee to fund candidates who supported campaign finance reform. He also launched a presidential campaign in 2015 on the platform of widespread campaign finance reform.
In the luncheon, Lessig also noted fractional proportional allocation would affect both parties’ electoral strategies. He said Democrats would lose having equal consideration over every vote, and Republicans would not win swing states by gaining only the votes of the Electoral College and not the popular vote.
In an interview after the event, Stevens said the Republican Party will only change its electoral strategy once it starts losing elections.
“I’m for what works,” Stevens said. “And in the real world, I think it’s gonna take the Republican party losing elections — popular and electoral — to face that they can’t win unless they change.”
Princeton University professor of neuroscience Sam S.H. Wang attended the luncheon and said he believed problems in the Electoral College could be fixed in simpler ways than were proposed by Lessig and Stevens.
“It just gets more and more technical, and it seems like a lot of the same goals of requiring some kind of national consensus could be achieved by a simpler move which is to simply give a large number of electors to whoever wins the popular vote, say fifty or one hundred,” Wang said. “I think that would solve the same problems.”

Rowing enthusiasts and casual spectators of all ages streamed through Harvard’s campus to watch more than 70 races at the 55th Head of the Charles Regatta on Saturday and Sunday.
More than 11,000 rowers participated in the Head of the Charles — the world’s largest two-day rowing competition. Tens of thousands of onlookers, many clad in sunglasses and college sweatshirts, came to root for their competing friends and family members.
Roxanne Ferreiro, a volunteer at the regatta, said she thinks the Saturday races were an overall success.
“It is the perfect day for the Head of the Charles. All the boats seem to be on target, doing well,” she said. “Everybody on the course, spectators, also seem to be in a festive mood. The weather is perfect. It continues to be a great tradition.”
The Head of the Charles — which began in 1965 — draws thousands of people, including both teenage competitors and elderly spectators, to Cambridge each year.
Competitors arrived from around the world, with some hailing from Australia and others from Japan. Attendees included professionals and amateurs alike, though Williams College rower Will C. Foote, said he thinks the event has a universal appeal.
“Having an understanding of the sport, the teams that are there, the technique that goes into it, you know, definitely plays into it,” he said. “But I feel like anyone can sort of appreciate it. It’s sort of a pretty poetic sport.”
While the Head of the Charles is one of many annual regattas around the world, some attendees said the location sets it apart from other competitions.
“I think it’s the beauty of the river. And seeing people,” Kate Andres, a volunteer at the regatta, said.
Other attendees said the enthusiastic crowds set the Head of the Charles apart.
“I love seeing people who rowed growing up and come back here,” Bob J. O’Malley, owner of a Boston rowing studio. “Their eyes light up and they’re just so excited about being back here. The sport — rowing — it has a part in their soul and you can tell. Especially if their kids are rowing and they used to row.”
Some students who attended the event said they think the Head of Charles brings a lively atmosphere to campus.
“It’s pretty exciting. There are a lot of people on campus,” Audrey Y. Chin ’23 said. “I’m excited to meet some people from all over the world. It’s just a really nice energy.”
While cheering on the rowers, many spectators indulged in tacos, sweet potato fries, and even fall-themed pumpkin spice lattes sold at stands along the river.
In addition to the vendors, local non-profits also staffed booths at the regatta to raise money. The Amigos School held a bake sale, while staffers from the Cambridge Community Foundation talked to attendees and handed out flyers.
Several members of Divest Harvard, an on-campus group that has called for the University to divest its endowment from fossil fuels, briefly held banners calling for divestment over the John W. Weeks Footbridge during a race on Sunday.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain did not comment on Sunday’s demonstration and referred to previous statements from University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow has repeatedly rejected the idea of divestment, arguing that it would be impractical and ineffective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students from universities representing five continents spent 36 sleepless hours coding over the weekend during the fifth annual HackHarvard, a student-run hackathon held at the Student Organizations Center at Hilles.
HackHarvard — a student group for technology enthusiasts — planned the hackathon, an event geared for participants to collaborate on developing new software.
Student organizer Catherine Yeo ’22 said this year’s theme — “connecting the dots” — focused on the intersection between technology and society, which inspired the projects coders created.
“We want to see how students build projects that not only are just great pieces of technology, but they’re also thinking about how to apply this technology to all walks of life,” Yeo said.
Computer science professor James H. Waldo delivered a keynote address and advised audience members on how to approach software development.
“Software is like pancakes,” said Waldo. “You always have to throw the first one out.”
The hackathon welcomed participants from a variety of different experience levels and disciplines, ranging from first-time hackers to seasoned coders.
First-time hacker and Dartmouth student Katherine F. Lasonde said she was attracted by the hackathon’s prestige and breadth of opportunities.
“I’m most excited to learn something new,” Lasonde said. “There’s a lot of cool talks and opportunities to try out avenues of technology I normally wouldn’t be exposed to in a classroom setting or even in a normal weekly club project setting.”
Three separate judges reviewed and scored each project. The projects with the highest average scores made it to final deliberations from which top three finalists were selected. Individual sponsors — like Facebook, Google Cloud, and financial technology startup Envel — also gave out awards based on specific challenges announced at the opening ceremony.
The top award went to Phillinda.Space, an app where users can fill out forms in their native language and translate them back into English. The team was composed of Boston University students Austin M. Negron and Rishab Nayak and Northeastern University students Sebastian Münchow and Daniël Trujillo.
Negron said Phillinda.Space was inspired by his grandmother, who does not speak English as her first language and has difficulty signing forms in English.
“Whether it’s filling out medical papers or applying for jobs or even just understanding tax documents, there’s an issue,” he said. “My grandma is going through this — there has to be millions of other Americans going through this that don’t have a grandson to help.”
Negron said he plans to give the Nintendo Switch, one of the many HackHarvard prizes, to his little brother.
Remy, an augmented reality bunny companion for those struggling with mental health, came in second place, and Connexion.AI, a machine learning platform that translates American Sign Language into spoken languages and vice versa, finished third.
Diane E. Williams, who served as a judge and project mentor, praised the unpredictable and exciting nature of hackathons.
“I’m just astonished by the ideas students have, the problems they want to solve, and what they accomplish in such a short period of time,” she said. “I love the delightful surprise at how students interpret the theme.”
Williams also said she tries to keep in mind students’ experience levels when judging.
“I don’t compare apples to kumquats,” Williams said. “I’m just amazed by what beginners are able to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of admissions scandals both nationwide and at the University, Harvard has implemented new policies — including requiring coaches to provide proof of recruits’ athletic abilities — to prevent fraudulent athletic admissions, according to Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise.
In March, federal authorities uncovered a nationwide scheme through “Operation Varsity Blues” in which parents bribed coaches at elite universities including Yale and Stanford to designate their children as athletics recruits, vastly improving their chances of admission. Though Harvard was not implicated in that scandal, the University suffered its own controversy in April when the Boston Globe reported that former head fencing coach Peter Brand had sold his home to the family of prospective students.
The University has implemented two new policies this fall in response to the scandals, according to Scalise. Harvard coaches must now provide materials that admissions officers can later use to verify an applicant’s athletic ability. The Office of General Counsel is also starting regular conflict of interest training for Athletics coaching staff.
Harvard coaches have historically provided forms rating prospective student athletes to Harvard’s admissions office, according to Scalise. On these forms, coaches rank a prospective student’s athletic ability. They also often provide a character description based on information learned about prospective students during recruiting trips.
Now, the Athletics Department is asking coaches to put “something that we can verify” on the form for the admissions office to review, Scalise said. Examples of possible materials coaches could include are newspaper articles and websites with national rankings.
During the nationwide admissions scandal, many of the students designated as athletics recruits had little to no experience in the sports for which they were listed as recruits.
Scalise clarified that Harvard’s admissions procedures already help prevent similar scams, as each prospective student receives an interview. Both the admissions office and athletics coaches work to verify students’ athletic accomplishments.
“When our admissions office gets a hold of our list, the list of people, they're doing their own internet searches,” Scalise said. “So they help us as well to verify.”
Scalise said Harvard is working to prevent similar situations to those exposed during the admissions scandal.
“You learn from your mistakes, but you also learn from other people's mistakes,” he said.
Though Harvard was not implicated in Varsity Blues, it has had issues of potentially compromised admissions of athletic recruits. In July, Harvard dismissed Brand after an independent inquiry found that his real estate transactions with the family of current and former athletes violated Harvard’s conflict of interest policy.
Brand sold his home in Needham, Mass. to iTalk Global Communications, Inc. co-founder Jie Zhao in 2016 for approximately $300,000 above its market valuation. Zhao’s younger son was admitted to the College shortly thereafter to fence for Harvard. Zhao’s older son, who was already on Harvard’s fencing team, graduated in 2018.
In response, Harvard announced that it would train its athletics coaching staff in its conflict of interest policies.
The University’s General Counsel has already begun these trainings this fall, according to Scalise. The General Counsel will train every new coach in their first year and every other year following the initial training, according to spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman.
Scalise said he hopes coaches have an intuition about what crosses the line and what does not when it comes to conflict of interest. He added that the fencing scandal demonstrated that the University had to offer more trainings on the topic.
“We need to make sure that people understand what they should do and not,” Scalise said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said Friday he will work with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to pilot new forms of bystander training after survey results showed rates of sexual misconduct among undergraduates have remained stagnant over the past several years.
The results come from the 2019 iteration of the American Association of Universities’ sexual misconduct survey — the largest-ever of its kind. The 2019 survey showed that roughly 33 percent of surveyed undergraduate women and 11 percent of undergraduate men at Harvard reported that they had experienced some form of nonconsensual sexual contact. In a previous version of the survey conducted in 2015, 31 percent of senior undergraduate women reported the same.
The 2019 survey found that more than 80 percent of harassment incidents at the College occurred between students. When asked about undergraduate perpetrators, Khurana highlighted the bystander training Harvard plans to offer.
“We will be piloting — working with OSAPR — bystander training in different ways to see what the most effective type of bystander training [is that] we can do in our community,” Khurana said.
Khurana said he thinks the University needs to examine the conditions that allow for sexual harassment and assault to occur on campus.
“I think we have to interrogate the conditions that create that view that you are entitled to disrespect someone, to challenge an expectation of consent, to create conditions of intimidation and coercion that prevent people from exercising agency over themselves,” he said.
Both the College and the University have made sweeping changes to Title IX enforcement over the past four years. Administrators split the Title IX Office in two and implemented mandatory training for faculty, students, and staff. This semester, Harvard unveiled an anonymous reporting system in response to affiliates’ feedback.
Asked why he thinks the changes made since 2015 did not impact the prevalence of sexual misconduct, Khurana said he does not know.
“I'm reflecting on that. I don't have an answer,” he said. “While [the changes] may not affect, you know, the specific one area — sexual harassment or sexual assault — they may affect other areas, improve situations in certain ways, or at least allow us to identify gaps that we might not have known.”
Only 49 percent of undergraduate women surveyed — compared to 74.7 percent of undergraduate men — said they believe Harvard administrators will treat complaints of sexual misconduct seriously. Khurana said he thinks College affiliates should put their trust in the current system.
“I think this is an area where people have to trust the system and so we have work to do to build that trust,” Khurana said. “I think it takes understanding that you have agency in how the process is managed, that it stays in control of the individual who's suffered the experience, and they will be supported throughout whatever decision they decide to make.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When former Harvard School of Public Health student Sarah M. Coppola developed a chronic medical condition in her third year, she started arranging medical visits with specialists. Before she could resolve the issues, however, she seriously injured her ankle.
The ensuing medical care drained her remaining specialist visits on her Harvard health insurance plan, forcing her to make a difficult choice.
“I found myself rationing my specialist appointments, and kind of deciding, like, what's more important,” she said. “[I found myself] having a conversation with my provider at [University] Health Services, of like, well, ‘this isn't gonna kill me, it's just majorly affecting my life, but like, this other thing could actually kill me.’”
Under Harvard’s Student Health Insurance Plan — which covers more than 10,000 graduate students, 2,600 undergraduates, and 600 dependents, through Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts’s provider network — specialist consultations are capped at a level some students say forces them to make hard choices about their physical and mental healthcare.
Massachusetts law requires that any student enrolled full-time at an institution of higher learning participates in a student health insurance plan or in a health insurance plan of comparable coverage. For graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, their premiums are covered.
Still, more than 15 graduate students pursuing Ph.D.s raised concerns about SHIP’s coverage and costs. Several of them said they have paid thousands of dollars out of pocket in co-pays and appointment costs despite the premium coverage.
Harvard University Health Services Spokesperson Michael Perry wrote in an emailed statement that while HUHS does not comment on individual cases, the plan’s administrators strive to balance benefits and costs for all members.
“SHIP is designed to ensure benefits apply to all members equally and that the costs to students are at a level that is appropriate across all of the students who utilize the plan,” Perry wrote. “The plan has to be designed with all students in mind.”
Coppola’s issues with SHIP stemmed both from her need to visit specialists outside HUHS and her compounding medical issues. Her chronic medical condition required that she see an outside specialist regularly, while wait times at HUHS forced her to also seek outside medical attention for her ankle.
Though physical health visits in-house at HUHS are unlimited, outside specialist consultations are capped at six. When Coppola’s orthopedist appointment required going outside HUHS, she neared her specialist cap and had to cancel all but one remaining chronic care appointment.
“I had some pretty concerning test results for major body organs that I was never able to follow up on because, had I gone, I would have ended up paying 100 percent out of pocket,” Coppola said.
Physical health visits, however, are not the only kind that face caps. Though the Student Health Fee does not cap visits to CAMHS, Harvard's plan — SHIP — caps mental health visits to providers outside of HUHS at 40 per year.
Some students say that they have sought outside providers for their longterm care.
Marisa J. Borreggine, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said that because of the cap on mental health visits, she has chosen to not see a provider at all.
“If I can't go as often as I would like, then it becomes more of a burden in waiting, like week to week, ‘when am I going to see this person again?’” Borreggine said.
She said she would not be able to develop a “rapport” with her provider without at least weekly visits.
Several mental health law and health insurance experts said that with regard to its specialist and mental health caps, Harvard is unique.
Susan L. Ettner — a Health Policy and Management professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health — wrote in an email that the limit raises questions in light of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, a federal law that requires health insurers to provide equivalent physical and mental health benefits.
“The caps you are describing are often called ‘quantitative treatment limits’ (QTLs) and they are covered under MHPAEA for health plans subject to parity compliance,” Ettner wrote.
Three experts on health insurance law — M. Susan Ridgely, a Senior Health Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation; JoAnn Volk of the Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms; and Jennifer E. Mathis ’88, Deputy Legal Director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law — agreed that the 40-visit cap raised questions about the plan’s compliance with the MHPAEA, but ultimately concluded that the plan’s specific administration was not subject to the act.
Harvard’s plan is a self-funded student health plan, meaning that coverage is paid for directly from the University’s coffers, rather than contracted out to a third-party insurance company. Though self-funded employer plans are generally subject to MHPAEA compliance, self-funded student plans are not. Likewise, student plans are normally required to comply with the act, but because Harvard’s plan is self-funded, it is considered an exception, according to Volk.
Perry, the Harvard spokesperson, wrote in an email that the plan is fully compliant with all required federal and state regulations.
Harvard’s plan has been reviewed and certified as compliant by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Perry. He also noted that a medical hardship fund is available for members who exceed the six-visit cap, though the funding is capped at $5,000 per member each academic year.
Though compliance is not required, Ridgely suggested there is an ethical question of whether a university ought to provide mental health coverage at parity, especially in light of how common mental health problems are on campuses.
“There may be a difference between what the university is legally required to do — and what the best evidence suggests that they should do,” Ridgely wrote in an email.
Christine M. Mitchell, who also graduated from the School of Public Health in the spring, never enrolled in SHIP because she has Marfan syndrome, which requires at least 27 specialist visits per year, she said.
Because she knew she would exceed the specialist visit cap, and that the cost of her specialist visits would be higher than the Medical Hardship Fund allows, she instead enrolled in the Mass Health Connector, even though her premiums would have been paid under Harvard’s plan. She paid $765 per month throughout her time in the doctoral program.
“The insurance plan is particularly bad for students who have chronic illnesses,” Mitchell said.
Perry noted that only a small number of students — less than one percent — run up on the specialist and mental health visit caps each year.
“It is important to note that there is no way to determine whether any or all of those members would have intended to exceed the six visits if they had been provided a higher limit,” he wrote.
Coppola said she thought the plan could be great for someone who does not have health care concerns that the University considers to be special.
“There are aspects of the plan that are really good for the average 20-something. It’s these fringe cases where it can cause this entire disaster,” she said.
“In an ideal world, it would work like normal insurance,” she wrote in a separate email. “No limit on specialist visits with a co-pay.”
The majority of graduate students interviewed said they would also like to see dental insurance included in the health plan. Currently, the dental health insurance plan is optional, requiring students to opt-in.
Sarah E. Loomis, a fourth-year Anthropology Ph.D. student, ran into problems with the dental plan when she traveled to Mexico for research.
“I pay the extra for the dental insurance,” Loomis said. “But I still ended up paying about $100 each for a whole bunch of cavities one summer after I was in Mexico and didn't have access to clean water so didn't brush my teeth as much as I should have.”
Siobhan M. Kelly, a third-year Ph.D. student in Religion, said the current health insurance plan also does not provide adequate coverage for gender-affirming services for transgender students, including the out-of-pocket cost for electrolysis and chest binders.
SHIP currently only covers electrolysis when it is deemed medically necessary as part of gender genital affirmation surgery. The plan does not cover electrolysis under other circumstances.
Kelly, however, said electrolysis is an important part of their own process of becoming more physically aligned with their gender identity. The procedure has cost them thousands of dollars out of pocket.
Kelly said accessibility to gender-affirming services is critical, and that Harvard could improve access whether through full-coverage, partial-coverage, or even through a reimbursement plan.
“It's been an incredibly important part of my own personal experience,” Kelly said.
Many students are now turning to ongoing union negotiations as a potential avenue for change.
One sticking point in negotiations has been coverage for dependents. When fifth-year Religion Ph.D. student Carleigh A. Beriont enrolled in SHIP, the cost of adding her daughter onto the plan posed a significant financial burden.
“I would say that Harvard kind of puts us in the position of having to choose between becoming scholars and finishing our Ph.D.s, and being parents,” Beriont said. “Because you know, right now, I pay over 90 percent of my stipend that I make every year in childcare costs and health insurance for my daughter.”
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers has been negotiating with the University for more than a year. Earlier this month, they began a strike authorization vote. Echoing Beriont’s concerns, HGSU has proposed lowering the cost of adding a partner or other dependent to the plan. HGSU has also called for removing caps on specialist and mental health visits, and expanded dental coverage.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University has proposed creating a fund to address concerns about covering the cost of adding dependents to the plan.
“The University has proposed it will create a fund in the amount of $250,000, that would be administered by HGSU-UAW, to assist student workers in defraying premium and co-pay costs for Union members and for covered spouses and/or dependents,” he wrote.
Parastoo N. Massoumi, a second-year Ph.D. student in Education, said that while most of her experiences with HUHS have been positive and that she is grateful to have health insurance, there is room to improve — improvement she said could be accomplished through a union contract.
“This is a part of a larger conversation of just many inequities that are facing Harvard graduate students and undergraduate students here,” Massoumi said. “While I’ve had positive experiences with [Counseling and Mental Health Services] or the Health Services, I know many, many graduate students that have not — many students who need better health care coverage, better dental coverage for themselves, their families, their spouses.”

Forget midterm season; it’s comping season. Take a look around and you’ll spot embroidered Patagonias, regular hoodies, t-shirts, stickers, and everything in between. What clubs should you join to get these fits, and what does the club gear say about the club? Here’s a guide to helping you navigate through the comp process while looking your best.
The Patagonia
Nothing says “I’m in a Harvard club” than a Patagonia. You can picture it now: the perfect heather gray-colored quarter-zip, with the Patagonia logo on the left, the carefully embroidered club logo on the other side. The gold standard of club swag, the Patagonia is reserved for only the highest honors of clubs (or at least those who have the funds). On the plus side, these sweaters are easily paired with jeans, khakis, boat shoes, or even a cozy Canada Goose jacket on top — which explains why owners of these jackets wear them everywhere. Still, we can only dream to be worthy of these jackets.
The Hoodie
They say you are what you wear, so hoodie people can only be described as warm and cozy. They don’t really care about the brand name, so you already know the club’s a guaranteed good time. Hoodies are used to advertise clubs, with fun designs that make you want to join. Within the hoodie category lies the crewneck, the distant cousin of the hoodie. A little more sophisticated, a little better graphic design, and a little more serious than the hoodie.
The T-Shirt
T-shirts come out of hibernation on laundry day, when there’s nothing else to wear except for the free t-shirt you got from the club you dropped last year. It’s super soft now from wearing it every night to sleep since it really can’t be exposed to the public. It also doesn’t hurt that t-shirts are a social bonus — oh, you went to that event? I did too! This type of gear is an ideal conversation starter and bonding moment.
The Sticker
If a club has stickers, they’ve truly invested in themselves. The fact that someone is willing to put a sticker of their club on their laptop or Hydro Flask shows a lot of devotion. There are also ranks of stickers, and design is high stakes in this scenario. You’re going to be stuck with this sticker for the rest of your life, so think twice before voluntarily advertising these clubs.
A club really does build a community, and swag works to enforce it. Your club has the potential to become your second family, and we hope you surround yourself with the people (and clothes) that bring out the best in you.

The world’s largest two-day rowing event, the 55th Head of the Charles Regatta, took place Oct. 19-20. Thousands of spectators flocked to the banks of the Charles River to watch more than 11,000 athletes compete. Members of Harvard’s four varsity rowing teams competed in the event alongside teams and individuals from around the world.


The first day of the regatta was clear and sunny, giving spectators watching the race from the Weld boathouse a clear view of the competition. A head race, teams race against the clock on a five kilometer course that starts near Boston University and ends past Eliot bridge.


With nearby streets closed off to cars, the event attracted thousands of fans and many vendors to the festivities surrounding the Charles River. Many spectators donned hats and sweaters to support their respective teams as they watched the competitive events. The bridges spanning the river were full of people throughout the course of the regatta.


Along the river, the woods were stacked with boats upon boats ready to be raced. Teams and individuals of all age groups, from high school through 40+, fought for the chance to row at this prestigious event, with many qualifying in previous regattas. Before the races, teams checked their boats to ensure that they were in top shape and race-ready before speeding along in front of thousands.


Crowds lined both sides of the Charles River, with vendors offering everything from Head of The Charles gear, to photo booths, to the chance to try urg machines. Local nonprofits also had booths, raising money and awareness for their causes. A variety of food options were avaliable throughout the regatta as well.


Donning old-fashioned flat caps and smiles early on Sunday afternoon, the Men’s Lightweight Varsity Four pushes off from Newell Boathouse into the Charles, preparing to row towards the race starting line. The team finished an impressive second, mere seconds behind the University of Pennsylvania.

 
Radcliffe’s Lightweight Four races to the finish, coming in 8th place. Harvard’s two women’s crew teams compete as Radcliffe and wear black and white instead of crimson. The teams retain the Radcliffe name as an homage to Radcliffe College, the all-female counterpart to Harvard College until the two schools officially merged in 1999. According to their website, the women’s crew teams voted against adopting the Harvard name and colors in 1976 in order to honor the women who started the teams. They are the only varsity teams that still compete as Radcliffe.


The rowers in one of Harvard’s Heavyweight Championship Eights dig deep as they pass under Weeks Footbridge on Sunday. Sporting the trademark “H” across their chests, the boat raced into 6th place. The US National Crew Team captured first and second place in the race.


Radcliffe’s Heavyweight Championship Eight passes Newell boat house after racing under the Anderson Memorial Bridge. The boat placed 8th out of the thirty-two boats.


Despite being the Regatta’s most sustainable event yet, with “zero single-use plastic available for purchase,” the event saw some protests from Divest Harvard proponents. On Sunday afternoon, a group from Divest Harvard held banners over the side of John W. Weeks Bridge to call on Harvard to divest from fossil fuels. The banners were up for about fifteen minutes. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred The Crimson to previous statements from University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who has repeatedly defended administrators' decision not to divest.


This year's regatta saw more than 11,000 thousand rowers compete in more than 70 races. Next year's Head of the Charles will occur Oct. 17-18.
