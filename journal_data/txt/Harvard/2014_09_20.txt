After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 21, 2014, at 10:50 p.m.
Harvard’s Graduate School of Education celebrated the public launch of its capital campaign on Friday, revealing that it has already raised $111 million toward a $250 million goal for a drive that will likely end in 2018.
The Education School campaign, dubbed “Learn to Change the World,” forms part of the University-wide fundraising drive that launched last September and aims to raise $6.5 billion. At least $4.65 billion has already been raised.
Like the Divinity School and the School of Design, the Ed School has traditionally had difficulty keeping up with Harvard’s other branches in fundraising. On Friday, during a full day of launch programming that included visits from top leaders in the field of education, the school's dean, James E. Ryan, was not shy about asking for support.
In making the case to the hundreds of leaders, graduates, and donors in attendance, Ryan addressed fundamental critiques of graduate study and research in education.
“I’ve heard some say that education schools are part of the problem and not part of the solution, and some reflexively assume that HGSE must fit that general description,” he said. “I’m sorry to be blunt here: those who share that opinion usually have little idea of what we’ve done and almost no idea of what we are doing.”
The daylong affair featured leaders like U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86, Harlem Children’s Zone founder and Ed School alumnus Geoffrey Canada, cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, and University President Drew G. Faust.
The day opened with a conversation between Duncan and education professor Monica C. Higgins on various issues in American education.
“I worry a lot about the disconnect between what our students look like and what our educators and administrators look like,” Duncan said, referring to the increasing racial diversity of America’s next generation. “Harvard can be part of the solution.”
When asked about the challenges in reducing the cost of higher education, Duncan focused on states’ commitments to affordability.
“States have to reinvest to higher education. Forty states cut funding for higher education…I don’t think they cut funding for prisons,” he said.
About a dozen demonstrators with signs reading “Less Testing, More Learning” met Duncan’s arrival. The protest was organized by Citizens for Public Schools, a nonprofit based in Massachusetts.
Lisa Guisbond, executive director of Citizens for Public Schools, said the protest was meant to draw attention to the prevalence of high-stakes testing in schools, which she claims is a product of Duncan’s policies, such as Race to the Top.
“Although he has spoken about the problems with too much testing...unfortunately his own policies have reinforced all those problems,” Guisbond said.
At a lunch later in the day, Canada received a standing ovation from the audience following his keynote address. He said his experiences at Harvard were transformative.
“The things that happened here changed my life,” Canada said. “There’s no chance that I would be doing the things that I do now if I had not launched my career at the Ed School.”
Referring to the lack of innovation in education policies, he said, "Education is one of the only professions I know where you don’t need patent attorneys...you can't give away a good idea. But we need folks…who will strike out and do some things that haven’t been done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have been pretty for the first 25 minutes, but it didn’t take three overtime periods to decide the game this time around.
Down a starting running back, wideout, and kicker—as well as a starting quarterback for the majority of the first half—the Harvard football team (1-0) still managed to dispatch Holy Cross (2-2), 41-18.
While playing without senior playcaller Conner Hempel, the Crimson appeared to be floundering coming out of the halftime break, giving the ball right back to Holy Cross after a three-and-out.
Crusaders quarterback Peter Pujals and company seized the opportunity, exploiting the inexperience of sophomore corner Sean Ahern and junior Jordan Becerra, and marching Holy Cross down the field to take its first lead of the game, 18-14.
The lead didn’t last long though, as Hempel came back in and appeared to have shaken off the back spasms that sidelined him in the first half. The senior scrambled free from an oncoming defender and hit sophomore tight end Ryan Halvorson open on the left sideline for 15 yards.
A few plays later, Hempel fired at sophomore running back Anthony Firkser, who leaned into the end zone to give the advantage back to the Crimson.
“Our offense starts with the front line, and those guys were outstanding tonight,” Hempel said. “[Senior running back Andrew] Casten did a great job in the holes, making people miss, and that makes my life easier, along with my receivers making amazing catches.”
Then the defense appeared. Junior defensive end James Duberg returned the ball on the next play to the Crimson, stripping the ball from Pujals. Junior linebacker Matt Koran picked it up, and on the ensuing play, Casten, filling in for injured junior tailback Paul Stanton, broke free for an 18-yard touchdown run, his second of the night to give Harvard a 27-18 lead.
“It’s exciting to make turnovers,” senior defensive end Zack Hodges said. “If you’re not worrying about us, then hopefully you’re dead. So I hope you’re either doing one or the other.”
Holy Cross’s next drive was nearly as short. Crusaders tailback Gabe Guild rushed into a block of Crimson defenders, and junior linebacker Eric Medes punched the ball out and fell on it.
Then the points began pouring in. Harvard capitalized on the fumble, with Hempel finding Firkser and Braunecker for 30 and 21 yards, respectively. Casten finished off the drive by punching through the defensive line to reach the end zone for the third time.
Casten, who had 151 rushing yards coming into the contest, surpassed his career total with 153 yards on the night when he broke free on a 55-yard scamper on the following possession, setting up Hempel’s 21-yard touchdown pass to Halvorson. The drive marked the Crimson’s fourth straight that ended in six points.
On the Crimson’s first drive of the night, Hempel scrambled on third down and went down hard. Harvard scored on the next drive off of a three-yard Casten run, but the quarterback was carted to the locker room, recalling memories of last year’s showdown with the Crusaders when Hempel left the game early due to a hyperextended knee. The senior finished with 137 yards and two touchdowns on Friday night.
Junior Scott Hosch took the reins at quarterback for the remainder of the half.
Hosch, who hadn’t thrown a pass in a game prior to replacing Hempel, led the team on a methodical scoring drive but also demonstrated his inexperience. With less than a minute left in the half, Hosch attempted to thread the needle to Braunecker over the middle, but the ball flew over the junior’s head and into the hands of defensive back Luke Ford.
The pick gave the Crusaders field position at Harvard’s 29-yard line with 40 seconds left. Pujals hit wideout Tyler Artim across the middle to put the ball at the one-yard line, but a holding penalty limited the Crusaders to just a field goal.
On Holy Cross’s second drive, the Crusaders switched to pass-heavy play-calling and moved the chains with ease, countering Harvard’s one-yard touchdown run with one of their own.
After bottling up the Crusaders on the first drive of the contest, the Crimson struggled to contain Pujals the rest of the opening half. The secondary showed its youth early on, missing tackles and blowing coverages. Pujals took advantage, torching Harvard’s defense for 125 yards through the air before the break.
But the Crimson adjusted during intermission, holding Pujals to just 69 yards passing and a pick after the Crusaders’ first drive of the second half.
“We did a lot of good things, but we can’t make the mistakes that we did and hope to beat a good team,” said Holy Cross coach Tom Gilmore.

*....almost!
Uniqlo, the affordable and stylish Japanese clothing store, recently announced that it will begin to grant scholarships to Harvard students starting next September. The scholarships will go to two students a year for three years, and will cover $200,000 of tuition costs. Just like that. No strings attached, no requirements, just a huge lump of cash to use towards their tuition.
We wish.
The company will require that the students be of Japanese descent, and in their first year at either the Harvard Business School or the Graduate School of Design. The students selected will also have to become interns at Uniqlo’s parent company, Fast Retailing, for the three years after graduation, though. So spread the message to all your friends and family who fit the requirements and hope they will thank you (and me?) with free Uniqlo clothing forever!
