After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disciplinary actions taken against Harvard undergraduates dropped to a six-year low during the 2020-2021 academic year, according to Administrative Board data updated last summer.
The Ad Board releases annual statistics on disciplinary infractions around “social behavior” — including sexual misconduct and drug and alcohol offenses — and academic sanctions for ​unsatisfactory grades or failure to meet minimum degree requirements. The number of measures by the Ad Board continued a downward trend from 2019-2021.
The Ad Board required just two students to withdraw from the College for disciplinary offenses, down from nine the previous school year. Another 16 students were forced to withdraw for academic reasons, inching down from the 17 who faced the punishment last school year.
The requirement to withdraw — the most serious disciplinary measure short of a dismissal — compels a student to fully disengage from the College and find full-time, paid, non-academic employment for at least six months before petitioning to return.
Thirteen students were put on disciplinary probation during the 2020-2021 school year, a decrease from 17 last year. Another 50 were put on academic probation, down from 55.
The Ad Board pays closer attention to the conduct of students on disciplinary or academic probation. Students who commit another violation while on probation may be required to withdraw from the College.
Only six students were admonished for academic or social reasons, down from 17 the year before. Admonition is a warning that falls short of putting a student on probation, per the Ad Board’s website.
The 2020-2021 academic year was marked by remote learning and a smaller campus population. The College housed freshmen and select upperclassmen last fall in an effort to reduce the number of students living on campus during the pandemic. In the spring, Harvard opened its dorms to juniors, seniors, and students facing challenging learning environments.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana chairs the Ad Board, which is made up of around 30 administrators and faculty. In addition to enforcing academic and community standards, the Ad Board also considers petitions for exceptions to academic policies.
A record number of students opted to take a leave or gap year amid the pandemic. Accordingly, the Ad Board approved 1,850 petitions for leaves of absence during the year, up significantly from 216 the year before. Just one student’s petition was denied.
Harvard cancelled study abroad for the spring 2021 semester in the fall, sending many students’ plans into jeopardy. Per the Ad Board, petitions approved for study abroad dropped last year to 74 from 103 in the 2019-2020 academic year.
The Ad Board approved an unprecedented 678 student petitions for “special” time extensions during the 2020-2021 cycle, suggesting the College maintained a flexible approach to final examinations. The data continued an upward trend from 323 approved petitions in the previous year, up from 22 during the pre-pandemic 2018-2019 year.
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the 2020-2021 Ad Board statistics.
The Ad Board data does not include students who were sanctioned or forced to withdraw for academic dishonesty. These cases are adjudicated by the Honor Council, a separate committee formed in 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 160 Harvard affiliates have signed onto an open letter asking the University to share Covid-19 testing kits with Harvard-affiliated health care workers for the remainder of winter break.
“We are asking Harvard to use any surplus testing capacity to offer COVID-19 testing to Harvard-affiliated healthcare workers until January 24th, and if practical, to other healthcare workers and high risk populations as well,” the letter, addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and top administrators, reads.
Harvard is affiliated with some of the region’s largest hospitals and health care centers, including Boston Children’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.
The push comes amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the Boston area. Between Dec. 29 and Jan. 4, Boston saw more than 14,000 new cases. Cambridge recorded 1,800 new cases in that same time frame. In the past week, Harvard has documented more than 880 new positive cases on its campus.
M.D.-Ph.D. student Leah L. Pierson, who authored the letter, said she drafted it after noticing a substantial drop in the number of Covid-19 tests processed by Harvard. The open letter notes that the school processed more than 40,000 tests per week during the fall semester, but has run less than 10,000 tests during some weeks of winter break, when most students are away from campus.
Pierson said the drop in processed tests means Harvard may have excess testing capacity that could be reallocated during winter break.
“One solution Harvard could consider would be having healthcare workers with Harvard email addresses create Color accounts to register tests,” she wrote in the letter. “Harvard could then provide these workers with pick-up and drop-off stations to retrieve and return testing kits. Although there would be logistical challenges involved, we believe Harvard could overcome these challenges.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the Harvard University Clinical Laboratory, which processes the majority of the school’s Covid tests, has already experienced an increase in tests ahead of the spring semester.
“The Harvard University Clinical Lab (HUCL) continues to see testing volume increase as we move closer to a resumption of most on-campus activities in the coming weeks, including many residential students returning to campus beginning January 14,” Newton wrote.
Harvard processed more than 16,000 thousand tests between Dec. 31 and Jan. 6 — a spike compared to prior weeks of winter break.
Still, signatories of the letter hope to see Harvard expand its testing network to affiliated health care workers for the remainder of the recess.
“As we’ve seen the explosion in cases at Harvard, even during this supposedly remote circuit breaker period, our health is really intertwined with that of the non-affiliated local community,” Ezekiel P. “Zeke” Benshirim ’19, a Ph.D. candidate in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, said. “So helping people who live in and work around us monitor their health seems like a good thing to do.”
Denish K. Jaswal, a graduate student in Philosophy, said she supports the letter’s goals.
“If you have the infrastructure in the pandemic and crisis that we’re in with it right now, no resources should go unused,” she said. “I think that is a good move, to push Harvard to make better use of its resources.”
Raising questions about broader public health inequities, Jennifer L. Cruz, a Ph.D. candidate in Population Health Sciences, said she is still considering whether to sign the letter.
Cruz noted that many Harvard-affiliated health care workers already have some access to testing. She said the letter does not acknowledge that it “is a lot of power and privilege to even be able to get tested.”
“You’re not acknowledging that you are getting tested when the vast majority of the world is not getting tested frequently,” Cruz said.
Newton, the Harvard spokesperson, wrote that the University is exploring ways to help affiliated hospitals, although the school is limited in its ability to share testing capacity.
“While HUCL is limited in its ability to take on additional testing volume with the affiliated hospitals, University leaders have been in communication with affiliate hospital leadership to see if there are ways we can help,” he wrote.
