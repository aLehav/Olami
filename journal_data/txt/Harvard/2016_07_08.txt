After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday morning, I entered my office on Hudson Street and glided past the silent engineers to the interns’ desk in the back room. I was halfway through another week at my internship, and so far, the job had mostly involved client reports and crossword puzzles. Normally, only the hum of the air conditioner filled the otherwise voiceless office, but just as I settled in with my morning coffee and the NYT daily crossword puzzle, Michael marched in.
A worn, yet robust old Russian metallurgist, Michael conveys his resolute opinions in a broken, stumbling English. Despite his difficulties with English, he is undoubtedly the company’s most talkative and disruptive employee—a true character whose presence oscillates between charming and irritating.
“Your name Mark? You do physics?” “No, it’s Ryan.” I chuckled. “I’m a mechanical engineer.” “You say Brian?” He leaned in and tilted his head as he asked this, resembling a grandfather suffering from moderate earing loss. “No, no, Ryan. With an ‘R’.” A nod. “You follow me. I show you how to do something.” I rose and followed him dutifully, just happy to finally be doing something but also worried about falling prey to his taxing chatter.
Throughout the morning, Michael demonstrated the process our firm used to catalogue and prepare metal pipes for failure analysis. While he explained each step, I was oddly engrossed in the contortions of his face as he struggled to find the right English words. It was subtle, but I understood his uncomfortable struggle, the endless wrestling match between tongue and brain.
Traveling in Ecuador this spring, I was resigned to speaking only Spanish for the first time in my life. Though it was thrilling to finally test seven years of Spanish classes, it was also terrifying to not be in control; I was on foreign soil, confined to the language and customs of Ecuador. I hoped each disjointed string of words occupied enough space to be deemed an intelligible sentence—likely Michael’s initial experience in America as well. I learned to listen hard, to never miss a word.
I remember lying in bed after my first day in Ecuador, enjoying the catharsis of my English thoughts; my mind had drifted back to Cambridge and brain break in Mather dining hall, where I often pressed my best friends on the stories of their pasts over cast-aside p-sets and Marshmallow Mateys. Fatigued by the daily obligation to provide updates of my life to people whose names I never remembered, I reserved brain break for intelligible refuge with friends; in time, I gained insight into authentic Lebanese food and the unconditional bond of Colombian families. Each friend had a riveting journey to share; coincidentally—and later, to my chagrin—I often procrastinated late into the night, energized by their biographies.
I remembered Ecuador and brain breaks as Michael spoke. As polarizing as he was, I couldn’t deny being fascinated by him and his persona. I listened harder and prodded him on, causing him to launch into a tangled gospel of his grievances with the world: Bernie Sanders. Outrageous tuition. The plight of print newspaper. Russians spend their whole lives seeking knowledge. A frustration with “lazy, poor people stealing my money.” His ideas were peculiar, and I found myself frequently wanting to react, wanting to push back against his ‘crazy’ ideas with a snarky retort. But at the same time, I also noticed that he laced pieces of his life story into his monologue. And so, I swallowed my retorts, tilted my head in acknowledgement, nodded slowly, and smiled.
I quickly found that his views were genuine and originated from firsthand evidence. This man wasn’t crazy. He was rational. I knew then that I had made the right decision when I chose to seek understanding before immediately criticizing his opinions. In fact, my smiling and nodding spurred him to express himself with frankness and profundity. As a result, I gained insight into the life of Michael: the eccentric Russian metallurgist.
It was a moment of raw vulnerability, as storytelling often is. To him, I was just an intern, here one week and gone the next; yet he still shared openly. He likely viewed it as a teaching opportunity, a chance to fill the role of wise sage to young, eager-beaver intern. He seemed content to share, and I was content to listen.
At Harvard, our stories often sound a lot like resumes, or like upscale dreams of Wall Street riches and future study abroad strolls through southern France. I must confess, I care little for these things; if I learned anything from Michael or brain break testimonies, it’s that dreams are simply introductions.
A real story appends a lifetime of experiences into a single network of moral, political and religious beliefs, as well as fears and unanswered questions. In moments of incertitude and courage, it reveals itself chapter by chapter. Multiply one story per person by seven billion people on earth, and you have before you the awe-inspiring fabric of humanity. These are the stories that collectively chronicle the past and disguise the future; all it takes is someone wise enough to listen.
But that may be the hardest part. It seems as though there is never enough time to listen. Too often, we turn away with a curt excuse: “my p-set is due in three hours; my essay in five; I have a meeting soon; my deadline is tonight.”
Rarely, “I would love to hear your story.”
At Harvard, we are always racing against time, trying to learn and absorb information at alarming rates. Eventually, we succeed. We change the world, and heck, some of us are even remembered.
Yet, perhaps we are missing the point entirely. Maybe the goal shouldn’t be a list of successes or accolades at all, but rather, an arduous and unceasing pursuit of stories, extracted from the minds of those around us. They hide there, waiting to be consumed chapter by chapter, waiting to be heard by willing and unwilling listeners alike.
So, the next time you find yourself conversing with an eccentric Russian metallurgist, just listen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision on Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, Harvard continued a prolonged dispute with an anti-affirmative action group over the discovery period in a similar, pending lawsuit challenging the University’s admissions policies.
The suit—filed in 2014 by Students for Fair Admissions—alleges that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions process in order to maintain racial “quotas” on the campus.
Currently, Harvard’s case is still in the process of discovery, a stage during which both parties can request information from one another to use in subsequent court proceedings.
Now, counsel from both sides of the dispute are debating which information should be obtainable during discovery. Harvard has sought information on Students for Fair Admissions’ membership so it can determine whether the organization has “standing” to sue on behalf of its constituents. Students for Fair Admissions has requested demographic information from Harvard’s admissions records to mount an argument proving that Harvard is rejecting academic talent for its goal of creating a diverse campus.  
Lawyers from both Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions convened at a status conference in late February to discuss several elements of the case. One of those disputed was the negotiated protective order upon which both parties had previously agreed. The order would shield “highly confidential” material, like individual student records, from court scrutiny.
In the February status conference, Patrick Strawbridge, a  lawyer for Students for Fair Admissions, voiced concern that the protective order would prevent their lawyers and expert witnesses from relaying relevant information to their clients.
Additionally, Strawbridge requested that Harvard make public data about academic performance broken down by racial demographics, asserting that the University has a burden to prove that their consideration of race in the admissions process is “achieving their stated goal which presumably is a diverse campus climate that stretches beyond the date of admission.”
Judge Allison D. Burroughs was hesitant to provide that information ahead of a decision on the Fisher case, citing concerns about the implications of making that data available.
“If, you know, if you are going to suggest that certain demographic groups perform or underperform or over-perform other demographic groups, I mean, that can have sort of political implications that I am not entirely comfortable putting out there unless we need to,” Burroughs said, according to a transcript of  the status conference.
It is unclear whether the conclusion of Fisher will result in a large document dump, but because Fisher reinforced the point that universities have a burden to prove their due diligence in the admissions process, Burroughs may call for more data to be shared.
In April, both parties agreed to draft letters once Fisher’s decision was released, detailing the ways they believed the Supreme Court decision would affect the ongoing litigation. Another status conference is scheduled for July 20.
Harvard called for Students for Fair Admissions to release details of its membership and funding sources to determine whether Students for Fair Admissions’ members have significant control over the organization's function. In response, Students for Fair Admissions sent Burroughs a letter in late April arguing that releasing its membership details would encroach on their first amendment rights and pose a danger to individuals who have chosen to stay anonymous.
At the April conference, Burroughs denied nearly all of Harvard’s requests for Students for Fair Admissions’ membership details, noting that she did not see the relevance of  those documents in the current litigation.
In June, William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and a partner at Wilmer Hale, the DC firm representing Harvard, filed to be admitted to the court as counsel for the University. According to Tania deLuzuriaga, Harvard decided to beef up its litigation team in the event that the case became more active in the wake of Fisher. Lee has since been added to the list of attorneys representing the Harvard in the court’s public database.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust once again took to the public pulpit on June 30 to defend the vitality of the humanities and the liberal arts more broadly, urging an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival to hold onto the arts in an increasingly science-oriented age.
In an hour-long conversation with Leon S. Wieseltier, an editor at The Atlantic and former Law School visiting professor, Faust—a historian by trade—lamented the societal shift towards vocational training and the corresponding tendency to use salary as the sole metric of success.
“First of all, many things that we value intensely never are going to be the most remunerative things,” Faust said. “And secondly, we educate students for a lifetime, not for one single job.”
About 14 percent of Harvard undergraduates major in the humanities, according to Faust—down from about 25 percent when she took office in 2007, although admitted students to the Class of 2020 indicated interest in studying humanities at an increased rate of 16.9 percent. Aiming to bolster the College’s humanities offerings, Harvard launched an undergraduate degree in Theater, Dance, and Media last year.
According to Faust, the state of the humanities nationwide is even more dire: “A lot of hard-pressed public institutions, the first thing they’re chopping off is the French department,” she said.
In recent years, she said, financial hardships have left many families hard-pressed as well, drawing many students to more vocational fields with the promise of higher-paying jobs.
“We read everywhere that this generation of Americans is likely to have less prosperity than their parents,” Faust said. “This has a very definite effect on our students.”
Moreover, Faust added, “we have many more students who are not just in college representing themselves. They're there for their whole family or their whole community.” Students from underprivileged backgrounds, she said, may gravitate toward fields where they think they will ultimately find a higher paycheck.
Faust also touched on the College’s recently-revamped General Education program, which she said is meant to offer students both a “common experience” while still allowing a “wider range of opportunities” than an explicitly defined core curriculum.
“We let our students roam a little more broadly, not having come to an agreement about which two dozen books or which particular works of art are necessary,” she said.”
The Aspen Ideas Festival was held in Colorado and hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit headed by Walter S. Isaacson, the famed biographer and current Harvard Board of Overseers member.

Had enough of Harvard Square’s fast-food burgers, burritos, and pizza? Look no further than Tom’s BaoBao, a new Chinese restaurant opening in the Harvard Square Galleria on July 12. 
This restaurant won’t be serving just any Chinese food, either. Tom’s BaoBao specializes in the traditional Chinese delicacy bao—more commonly known as steamed buns in the U.S.—and prepares the food with even more attention to detail than you give your Tinder profile pics.
Employees at Tom’s BaoBao have undergone rigorous training in the art of bao-making over the past months, and you’ll be able to watch as they create the perfect steamed bun at the restaurant.
Bao, a 1,200 year old delicacy, is made by carefully crafting fist-sized buns out of dough filled with a wide variety of meats or vegetables (at Tom’s BaoBao, even a lobster filling will be available). Restaurant owner and entrepreneur Tom Tong’s revitalization of the bao-making tradition is already a hit in China, where Tong’s restaurant chain GanQiShi already has around 200 locations.
After opening his first U.S. restaurant in Harvard Square, Tong has plans for a Tom’s BaoBao in Providence, and there are also rumors that Tong will roll out a bao food truck down the line.
We welcome the addition of any new tasty restaurants in Harvard Square, and Tom’s BaoBao is poised to be a fitting replacement for Yogurtland in the Galleria storefront.
