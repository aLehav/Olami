After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Varsity athletes at Harvard have demanding schedules during the season. They have to factor in grueling practices, lifts, and conditioning sessions along with their academic schedules, which can be quite a challenge when sports can take dozens of hours a week.
Yet during their offseasons, most athletes are able to take a step back and limit their frequent treks across the river, to the Malkin Athletic Center, or to the boathouse.
But that is not the case for freshman Candida Janachowski and senior Matt Brown.
Janachowski and Brown both committed to Harvard for one varsity sport—women’s soccer and men’s basketball, respectively. However, they have also embraced a challenge few Crimson athletes choose to take on—a second sport. Janachowski also competes for Harvard in the long jump for the track and field team in the spring, and Brown also plays wide receiver for the football team in the fall.
However, being in season all year is nothing new for the two athletes. Both became accustomed to competing year-round in high school, especially Brown, who also participated in track and field.
“I was always in season [in high school]," Brown said. “But the seasons were not nearly as grueling as they are at the Division I level, so it was still a significant adjustment.”
The physical component of constantly being in season took its toll on Brown. The Barrington, R.I., native was unable to participate in the strength and conditioning training his teammates underwent during their offseasons, and he did not have time to give himself a break.
“My body would get used to running on turf fields, giving maximum amounts of effort for short periods of time, constantly receiving and delivering full-contact hits,” Brown said. “Once I transitioned to basketball, it would take me a few weeks to get out of football shape, lose some weight and build up the endurance. The transitions took a toll on my body, especially my joints.”
As a freshman, Janachowski says that she has not yet felt the long-term physical effects of being a two-sport athlete. Nonetheless, her busy schedule has brought about a different sort of difficulty. Teams usually spend a lot of time together, especially in the offseason. Even out of season, many still have organized team dinners, team outings, and casual practices—but Janachowski misses them due to her other commitments.
“Socially, you do miss certain team activities,” Janachowski says. “And it leaves you behind not only physically and technically, but you also miss out on the group dynamic.”
Janachowski’s experience mirrors Brown’s in that she faces a dynamic transition from one sport to another. The short-range power she requires as a long jumper doesn’t directly translate into the endura nce needed to be a soccer player.
For Brown on the other hand, not all of the skills necessary to excel in football and basketball are mutually exclusive. According to the senior, basketball developed his ability to move quickly and fluidly and established his ability to make split-second decisions off opponents’ actions, a skill which also applies to Brown’s position as a wide receiver.
“As a wide receiver on the football team, I would often be put in…situations where I would be in one-on-one coverage, and the quarterback would loft a high-arching pass to the back of the end zone,” Brown said. “I would use my body to position myself…right in time to jump up and catch the pass. I like to think I excelled in this because for all the box-out and rebounding drills I was put through in Lavietes [Pavilion] throughout the years.”
While transitioning between football and basketball has certainly proven difficult at times, that challenge has been secondary to Brown’s struggle to find balance between his life as an athlete and as a student. Typically, varsity athletes are given planners and resources to provide aid with time management during the season. However, these resources are not extended to athletes who lack an offseason, therefore depriving them the chance to take on a heavier courseload when they are not in season.
According to Brown, these complications can force two-sport athletes to make hard academic decisions with limited guidance. However, both Brown and Janachowski have embraced this disadvantage as best they can.
“School-wise, it’s made me really time-conscientious,” Janachowski said. “It’s honestly helped me manage my schedule. Otherwise I’d procrastinate a whole lot more. But because I’m on a time crunch all the time, I’ve been able to manage everything better.”
However, in the midst of the balance-seeking, there are two things that both Janachowski and Brown believe are no-brainers—first, their equal preference for both sports, and second, their choice to become two-sport athletes in the first place.
“I did commit [to Harvard] for soccer,” Janachowski said. “At the same time, I love the track team and their dynamic and what they do. But I would say the dynamics of both teams are very different, and I can’t say I prefer one over the other.”
Brown will be graduating this year with the Class of 2015. Having sacrificed every semester of his Harvard life to a sport, he is unwavering in his decision.
“I would absolutely play two sports if I were able to do it again,” Brown said. “After my experience of playing two sports at Harvard, I don’t feel like I could be any more prepared to begin the next phase of my life.”

Harvard is renaming its College deanship after a donation from alumni Ami K. Danoff ’84 and William A. Danoff ’82—marking the second time this year that the University has sold the naming rights to a major dean position.
The gift and the deanship’s renaming comes almost two years into the public phase of Harvard’s $6.5 billion capital campaign. Patrick S. McKiernan, a spokesperson for Harvard’s Office of Alumni Affairs and Development, declined to specify the size of the Danoffs’ gift.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which includes Harvard College, is seeking $2.5 billion in its portion of the record-seeking fundraising drive. Last fall, the FAS deanship, currently held by Michael D. Smith, was renamed following a donation from Paul B. Edgerley and Sandra M. Edgerley ’84.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who will now hold the official title of Danoff dean of the College, welcomed the donation in a statement and said the funds will support initiatives at the College, including its more than $1 billion House renewal project and goals at the discretion of Smith and Khurana. University planners recently named Lowell House its fifth renovation project.
Although many faculty positions reflect the names of donors, the University has not typically sold naming rights to school dean positions. But Harvard, seeking a record for higher education fundraising, has recently grown more willing to trade major naming opportunities, often irreversibly, for pledges.
The Danoffs’ most recent donation grants them permanent naming rights, meaning that the dean of Harvard’s flagship school will forever bear their name, McKiernan confirmed in an email. William Danoff, who is vice president of Fidelity Investment, cited the leadership of University President Drew G. Faust in a statement as a motivating factor for the donation.
Last fall, in exchange for a $350 million pledge from a foundation run by Gerald L. Chan, the University renamed the School of Public Health in honor of Chan’s late father. McKiernan confirmed that the FAS deanship and School of Public Health’s name changes are also permanent.
As of February, the University-wide capital campaign had cleared the $5 billion mark.

Following a year of administrative scrutiny of Harvard’s unrecognized social organizations, one all-male final club recently tightened its guest policy in an effort to reduce liability.
Fox Club graduate board president Douglas W. Sears ’69 said Monday that non-club members will not be allowed in the Fox, an all-male final club located on JFK Street. Only when events are planned with grad board approval in advance will guests be allowed in the club.
“Bottom line, the grad board said that this is a private club and we’re not having guests,” Sears said.
Sears said the Fox’s grad board wanted to return the club to its original purpose: to facilitate friendships between its members rather than serve as a party space for the College.
Sears, who was formerly president of the now defunct Inter-Club Council and who has been involved in the final club graduate board network for more than 15 years, has routinely argued that because there are few party places at Harvard, final clubs bear the unwanted burden of providing a social scene to the College.
“The College doesn’t want us to be a venue,” Sears said. “The grad board doesn’t want us to be a venue. And the undergraduates need to understand they have joined a private club, and we want to have the activities of the club go to continue the goals that it has always had.”
Sears said that the no-guest policy was not a direct response to administrators, but he thinks they share the same goal of the club’s grad board in trying to make the Fox serve less as a space for “random ad hoc venue-type events.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana declined to comment on whether or not he had any conversations with clubs regarding their guest policies.
Khurana follows a line of administrators that have had to navigate the College’s historically fraught and fragile relationship with its social clubs. This year, he has vamped up attention to the College’s unrecognized social scene, which plays host to numerous male and female final clubs, fraternities, sororities, and several other social groups.
Behind the scenes, Khurana has met with members of unrecognized clubs and pushed them to reconsider their practices. In March, he blasted a controversial party invitation circulated to some students by the all-male Spee Club.
While the all-male Fly Club does not have a no-guest policy, John L. Powers ’70, the Fly’s graduate board president, said the club annually revisits its guest policies. Powers added that no-guest policies have more to do with liability concerns.
“I think that the consideration of no-guest policies has more to do with potential liability and less to do with pressure from the College since the final clubs are unrecognized and not subject to Harvard’s jurisdiction,” Powers, a former Crimson sports writer, wrote in an email.
Faced with liability concerns in the late 1990s after the death of an MIT student at a fraternity, several final clubs tightened their guest policies.
More than a dozen undergraduate members of the Fox did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
International Rescue Committee President and CEO David Miliband called on the 670 students set to graduate from the Kennedy School of Government to help instill a new innovative spirit into foreign policy and humanitarian affairs worldwide in the school's commencement address Wednesday.
“Government can be a great force for good, but it requires a cast of mind that I would describe as entrepreneurial,” said Miliband, who served as U.K. Foreign Secretary from 2007 to 2010 and as a Member of Parliament for South Shields from 2001 to 2013. “That is the role of politics, to add entrepreneurship to necessary bureaucracy.”
Miliband said that discussions around foreign policy and humanitarian affairs are lacking in vigor compared to conversations surrounding domestic policy, despite the fact that globalization has in many ways united the aims of domestic and foreign policy in the creation of a “global village.”
“It’s really extraordinary that the world’s population has never been healthier, wealthier, better educated, better connected, but at the same time the number of people displaced by conflicts and disaster has never been higher,” Miliband said during a ceremony in JFK Park. “States prey to chaotic violence, and an international system that is weaker and more divided...demand our attention.”
Miliband pointed to the ongoing withdrawal of major world powers, in particular the United States and the United Kingdom, from the world stage as a reason for this “vacuum in the global commons,” pointing to the refugee crisis in Syria—which he characterized as “declining into a version of hell”—as an example of the failings of modern foreign policy.
“While some things are complicated, and you can understand why they’re not being done, others are relatively simple and when they’re not done it’s closer to a crime than a tragedy,” Miliband said, highlighting Western reluctance in admitting vulnerable Syrian refugees as an example of global inaction. “Over the last four years we have proved the risk of not doing too much but of doing too little—we’ve shown in the terrible unfolding that not to take action is an action of consequence every bit as grave as intervention itself.”
Miliband proposed two practical political solutions to begin to address this problem, endorsing French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius’s proposal for the creation of a new code of conduct at the UN Security Council in which countries would voluntarily suspend their veto powers in cases concerning genocide and ethnic cleansing and calling for a renewed interest and commitment to UN peacekeeping.
Concluding his address, Miliband reflected on the humanitarian work of Varian M. Fry ’30, who helped rescue more than 2,000 refugees from Nazis as an agent of the International Rescue Committee’s predecessor, urging students never to lose their drive to public service.
“There is a view abroad that your generation is an apathetic generation…that’s not what I see,” Miliband said. “It’s easy to get lost in the detail and forget that what inspired you to join a school of government in the first place was a passionate desire to see a problem alleviated and the world improved, and my message to you is never forget that, never lose that sense of passion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Margot Gill, currently the administrative dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, will become the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ first administrative dean for international affairs starting on July 1.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an email to FAS faculty and staff Tuesday that, in her new role, Gill will act as FAS’s liaison with foreign governments, international corporations, foundations, and NGOs to implement FAS initiatives. Although Gill said she is not yet sure which specific initiatives she and FAS faculty will pursue, she said she will be in constant communication with FAS faculty and the leadership of Harvard’s international centers.
“First and foremost I need to align with our faculty interests,” Gill said in an interview Wednesday, adding that Smith asked her to consider taking the position early in May.
Last semester, a group of Harvard’s international center directors crafted a white paper about Harvard’s global strategy and recommended the creation of an FAS-specific position to liaise between the school, the centers, and international groups, according Brian D. Farrell, director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
“It’s important that there be a uniform voice and also a single individual at the head with respect to our connections with international supporters and international institutions around the world,” said Ferrell, who is also a Biology professor. “FAS being such a large portion of our activities, it made sense for this to be an FAS appointment.”
Ferrell, along with Gill and Smith, emphasized that Harvard is expanding its international presence.
“Harvard is taking some bold steps forward in terms of international engagement,” he said, adding that this new position is “needed” in order for Harvard’s centers, the FAS, and international interests groups to effectively communicate.
Gill, for her part, said Smith has emphasized that Harvard has “expanding interests in Asia,” and that “there is a good deal of interest in sub-Saharan Africa.”
“Indeed, few people on campus are as familiar with the range of the FAS international engagement as Dean Gill, and I can think of no better person to assume the task of guiding the future development of that engagement, which has today become more important than ever before,” Smith wrote in his email to FAS faculty and staff.
According to Jorge I. Domínguez—who is stepping down from his positions as vice provost for international affairs and special adviser for international studies to Smith—Gill will work closely with his successor and carry out some of the work the vice provost would normally do, but specifically focus on FAS-issues that “requir[e] more sustained attention.”
Gill has been at Harvard since 1977 and has served as administrative dean for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for more than 20 years. She said her work as administrative dean for international affairs in FAS will be a “natural progression” with her previous work at Harvard.
“So much of my time—even as far back as my time as an Allston Burr senior tutor and activities largely focused in Harvard College—there has always been an international element on way or another,” Gill said, citing her work with international alumni, governments, and foundations.
Gill has worked with Fundación México en Harvard, a program that provides financial assistance to Mexican Ph.D. students at Harvard, for more than 20 years.

On a windswept, sunny afternoon day on Holmes Field at Harvard Law School, former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her spouse, the astronaut Mark Kelly, emphasized the value of public service to the Law School’s Class of 2015.
Giffords represented Arizona’s 8th district in the U.S. House of Representatives until she was shot in the head in 2011 while meeting with a group of constituents. Following the near-death experience, Giffords resigned her position in Congress to focus on her recovery and, with her husband, has advocated for tighter gun control in the United States.
Kelly, who has flown several missions into space, spoke about the unlikely rise from “crappy pilot” to test pilot and astronaut and his wife’s injury.
“How good you are at the beginning of anything you try is not a good indicator of how good you can become. Getting an LP is not the end of the world. Neither is failing the bar,” Kelly said, referencing the Law School’s grading system.
Kelly also implored members of the Law School’s graduating class to pursue careers in public service and follow his wife’s example.
“As a graduate of HLS we hope you continue this tradition of serving others and to serve your community wherever you can. Let me correct that, we’re asking you to. We’re asking you to seize this chance of service because these chances, they don’t ever come around very often,” Kelly added.
Giffords, who was in a wheelchair because of a bicycle accident, spoke briefly at the end of the ceremony.
“Be Bold. Be Courageous. Be Your Best. Go Crimson,” Giffords said.
The ceremony also featured several student awards given by Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow. She honored students for service to the Law School community, including several for their pro bono work as students.
“You are all incredible,” Minow said.
Jon D. Hanson, a Law School professor, was also honored at the Class Day ceremony. Hanson spearheaded the Law School’s systemic justice project, which focuses on tackling societal and policy problems with the law. He discussed the events at Ferguson, Staten Island, Cleveland, and Baltimore involving police violence towards black men, and “the chasm between law and justice.”
The ceremony was followed by a reception in Crossroads and Jarvis field.

More than 1,000 members of the Class of 2015 participated in Senior Gift, according to Senior Gift Co-Chairs Katie C. Gamble ’15 and Alissa Song ’15, whose campaign received $100,000 from an anonymous donor to benefit House life.
Senior Gift, which is often debated by students year-to-year, was especially controversial this spring as College seniors questioned the value of donating to Harvard as they sent flippant messages and GIFs over email.
Students from the College’s Class of 2015 detailed the outcome of Senior Gift efforts at the College’s annual Class Day celebration in Tercentenary Theater on Wednesday, which was headlined with a speech by Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman ’03. Portman took the stage at the end of the ceremony to speak to her experience balancing her fame in the performing arts with the academic rigor of Harvard. “I got in only because I was famous,” Portman said. “This is how others saw me; it was how I saw myself.” Portman reflected on attempting to find a “serious and meaningful” track at the College, while also maintaining her passion in acting. Portman’s time at Harvard helped her realize her own personal and professional abilities, she added, noting her performance in the Oscar-nominated film “Black Swan,” as well as a film she directed, “A Tale of Love and Darkness.”
Also at Wednesday’s celebration, Khurana delivered his first Class Day speech as dean of the College. In his remarks, he spoke to the Class of 2015 about his own upbringing and asked students to remember the “power of their past, and the possibility of their future.”
Khurana reflected on his parents’ effort to integrate his family into American culture after immigrating to the United States, arguing that family is a crucial factor in student achievement.
“No one comes to Harvard alone,” Khurana said. “The people who sit beside you and behind you have stood behind you for a long time, and many of them have traveled a long way to witness this moment in your life.”
Khurana also walked students through process of the Commencement ceremony and emphasized the historic prestige and importance of Harvard College, the University’s flagship school. After the graduate schools are called forth at Commencement, Khurana told the seniors, “the College, as the oldest and original part of this University will be called forth.”
After two days of festivities, the College’s Class of 2015 will receive their diplomas on Thursday, Harvard’s 364th Commencement Day.

HAPPY THURSDAY, HARVARD!
In case you haven’t heard, today is Commencement (Harvard's 364th, if you care). Thousands will flood Tercentenary Theater (that patch of grass and trees between Widener and Memorial Church) to see the College’s seniors and thousands of students from other Harvard schools earn their degrees. Don’t forget your gown and your Harvard ID!
Now, onto the events.
WEATHER: Weather may be an event on Thursday. Thunderstorms are a possibility, and heat is a guarantee. Harvard's graduation gowns won't help those trying to cool off, so stay hydrated and look for shade.
GET IN LINE: Even if you have a ticket, you’re not guaranteed a seat. And the definition of Tercentenary Theater has gradually expanded over the years to accommodate more people, meaning some seats have no view of the stage. Lines begin to form outside the gates to the Yard shortly after sunrise.
CRIMSON COMMENCEMENT: Pick up your special edition of The Crimson as you march into the Yard. Seriously, the ceremony runs at least three hours, so you’ll appreciate the reading material.
MORNING EXERCISES: An elegant procession led by University President Drew G. Faust is scheduled to end in the Theater at 9:25, meaning Morning Exercises get going shortly after that. See above for the cold hard fact that if you don’t have a seat by 9:25, you’re not in good shape. Morning Exercises are mostly pomp and circumstance, and they wrap up by noon. After that, College seniors head to their houses to get their degrees and graduate students head to various locations for their ceremonies.
AFTERNOON EXERCISES: Deval L. Patrick ’78 is the headliner and will speak in the Theater sometime between 2:30 and 4:15. Faust also gives her annual report to the Harvard Alumni Association during the afternoon session, which is the first alumni event for graduates (and probably the first time you'll be asked for money as a Harvard alum!)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Finding words to describe this past season for the Harvard women’s hockey team is beyond difficult, but listing the team’s accomplishments is a good place to start. Winning the Beanpot on home ice. Check. ECAC Champions. Check. Ivy League Champions. Check. Earning a conference playoff crown, a third straight berth in the NCAA Tournament, an appearance in the national title game? Check, check, check. Never before in the storied history of Crimson women’s hockey has a club achieved all of the above.
As an assistant coach on this year’s staff, I am proud of our entire team. However, I am particularly proud of our class of 2015, all of whom I played alongside for at least two seasons and coached for at least one. They are largely responsible for what was one of the most triumphant winters in program history.
The septet of which I speak so highly includes Kalley Armstrong, Hillary Crowe, Sarah Edney, Lyndsey Fry, Marissa Gedman, Josephine Pucci, and Samantha Reber. Together they own a laundry list of on-ice accolades. They have been Olympians, All-Americans, and Patty Kazmaier nominees—an award bestowed upon the best player in Division I. They boast a combined 19 All-Conference selections. One has been named the league’s best defenseman, another the league’s best defensive forward. Four have served as team captains. As impressive as this list of accomplishments is, it does our seniors little justice. Over the past 12 months—the first time in which they were all in the same class—this group led with poise, selflessness and personality.
These seven are winners in every facet of the word, but their prosperity has not come without adversity. Armstrong spent the 2013-2014 year in her native Toronto, Canada, sidelined by a serious concussion, then captained this year’s team and scored the goal that sent us to the national title game. Crowe broke her wrist in the last regular season game of her career, only to make a miraculous comeback in the national semifinal. Edney was named an All-American this season, less than a year after major hip surgery. Fry eclipsed both 50 goals and 100 points in 2014-2015, despite fighting a hip injury that would require surgery at year’s end. Gedman sat out in 2012-13 with a torn Achilles, then captained the team to the NCAA quarterfinal the next year. Pucci missed 2012-2013 with a head injury, then made the 2014 United States Olympic Team, and returned to Harvard this past fall. Samantha Reber, despite her fair share of health scares, including a three-day hospitalization leading up to her last regular season series, missed just two games in four years and led the class in career games played (134). Even Jessica Perillo, an honorary member of the class, battled through a softball career riddled with injury, ultimately taking on a dual role as manager of both the softball and hockey teams. She brought an aura of positivity and enthusiasm to our team that was simply invaluable.
All of this, and they never sought pity. Instead, they fought on. And in so doing, they led on. Each with her own flair. Army is as natural a leader as you could find. She marches to the beat of her own drum, and it’s the coolest, goofiest drum on the team. HC is the ultimate example of an athlete who prepares. From off-ice training to recovery to nutrition, she leaves nothing to chance. She gets her business done, and doesn’t expect praise along the way. Eddy has what the team endearingly refers to as “sass.” But what they all know is that she would fight an army for any one of them. Lynds is the quirkiest of them all. Her interests outside of hockey are vast and varied, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t bring her best self to the rink every day. Geddy is a warrior. No one ever goes up against her without expecting a battle. And yet, she balances that intensity with an unrivaled sense of humor. Pucc is as humble as she is athletically inclined. She doesn’t need to be reminded of her own significance, but her finest quality is helping others feel appreciated for theirs. Rebes seemingly is never in a bad mood. She’d do anything for anyone, and that selflessness is perhaps even more clear on the ice, as she leaves Harvard in the top-10 for career assists.
These seven are great hockey players, and even better leaders. In 2014-15, they led as a cohesive unit while staying true to themselves and their own style. This allowed them to reach every member of the team in some way, and create a foundation that never crumbled. They entered Harvard as part of three different classes, but leave today as one. One class whose legacy of selflessness in pursuit of success will stay with the program for years to come.
Laura Bellamy ’13 is a former co-captain and current assistant coach of the Harvard women’s ice hockey team.

Harvard awarded 7,736 degrees and 32 certificates during its 364th Commencement exercises in Tercentenary Theater on Thursday morning, including 1,612 degrees to students of the College and 995 to students of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“I salute all these women and men, trusting that they will forever wisely enjoy the freedoms that their education has given to them, while bearing the responsibilities that their learning demands of them,” said Michael D. Smith, dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who spoke briefly before the conferral of degrees by University President Drew G. Faust. 
Ten people received honorary degrees from the University: climate scientist and Columbia geology professor Wallace S. Broecker; political theorist and University of Michigan professor Robert Axelrod; Nobel laureate and former Harvard Medical School professor Linda B. Buck; art historian Svetlana Alpers; Yale President and psychology professor Peter Salovey; public interest lawyer Bryan Stevenson; Harvard education professor emerita Patricia A. Graham; Congolese gynecologist and women’s rights advocate Denis Mukwege; opera singer Renée Fleming; and former Massachusetts governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, who delivered the Commencement address during the day’s Afternoon Exercises.
Patrick and Mukwege each received standing ovations from the audience of students, families, and alumni upon receiving their honorary degrees.
“Far beyond his hospital, he has become an impassioned advocate for Congolese women, demanding attention to the barbarity they continue to endure and urging an end to the violence,” Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said as he introduced Mukwege. “He maintains his faith and courage in the face of the unspeakable.”
The Morning Exercises also featured three speeches by graduating students. Jim P. McGlone ’15 delivered the Latin Salutatory, entitled “Quid durat?”, reflecting on the passing of this year’s record-breaking winter, arguing that what ultimately stands the test of time is not the University itself but the bonds between classmates it creates.
Jake W.C. Silberg ’15 and graduating Ph.D. student Anna F. Wang Erickson delivered the senior and graduate English addresses, respectively, both calling for engagement and compassion in life after the University.
“It is easy to disengage in the world as it is, when we hear of the suffering of people from Iraq to Newtown, when we know the globe is warming and the middle class is shrinking—it easy to think that no one can solve these big problems, and to conclude that no one should try,” Silberg said, characterizing a diploma from Harvard as not just a piece of paper but also a call “to see the world as it is and still choose to imagine the world as we want it to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard women’s volleyball team’s most anticipated game of the year, sophomore setter Corie Bain shined.
Two points away from taking home the fifth set of its game against Yale in the packed Malkin Athletic Center on Oct. 3, the second-year standout stood with the fate of the team in her hands.
Rising and hitting the ball to initiate play, her first serve went over the net and fell to the ground at the feet of the Bulldogs. The subsequent serve followed suit, as Bain and company were able to hand their archrival only its second loss in conference play since Nov. 2011. The sophomore was dominant throughout the contest as well, recording a triple-double with 11 kills, 32 assists, and 12 digs. She also registered four more aces in the contest, part of a season-high of six.
But when Bain put this performance together, few, if any, were surprised. Games like this one were the rule rather than the exception for last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year and a large reason why Harvard brought home a share of the conference championship for the first time since 2004.
“She takes a lot on herself,” junior Caroline Holte said. “She takes on a huge burden being one of the best volleyball players that arguably I’ve ever played with. It’s really a lot of stress that we put on her, [but] she performs constantly.”
The Manhattan Beach, Calif., native garnered attention for her ability to affect all facets of the game. As the setter, Bain led Harvard in assists with 602 on the season. But despite the fact that she was aiding the attack of her teammates more than anyone else, she also led the team in kills per set with 2.63. In addition, she led the conference in service aces per set while finishing second on the team in digs per set behind junior libero Sindhu Vegesena.
“I think experience gave me a lot of wisdom going into every Ivy game,” Bain said. “I didn’t realize what was at stake for every single Ivy game and what mentality I had to have going into them freshman year. Everything was so new and fun that I didn’t feel any pressure. Sophomore year I knew there was more on the line.”
All-around performance was evident in the sophomore’s play in each game throughout the season. She recorded 10 triple-doubles in her second year with the squad, including one in each of the team’s final five matches that went to five sets. Two of those 10 triple-doubles even came in three-set sweeps, including a straight-set victory at Payne Whitney Gymnasium which handed Yale its first home conference loss in over two years.
Despite a breakout freshman campaign that earned her five Ivy League Rookie of the Week awards, the sophomore managed to improve across the board on the court this season. Bain managed to raise her hitting percentage even though she was more aggressive on the attack this season. She also recorded a higher amount of kills, assists, and digs per set than her first-year campaign.
Even in times of difficulty, Bain was a consistent performer and leader throughout the year. When the squad dropped two of the first three games on its conference schedule—significantly lowering its odds of taking home the Ivy League title—Bain didn’t dwell on the team’s slow start. The second-year standout rallied off three straight triple-double performances in victories to help right the course for the team, which would go on to win out its remaining conference games to finish the season with a conference record of 12-2.
“She performs so well under that pressure,” Holte said. “We couldn’t be more lucky to have her.
Bain’s season caught the attention of Ivy League and nonconference coaches alike. She was named to the All-Ivy First Team as a unanimous selection for the second year in a row.
“It’s really insane to me that she’s still just a sophomore,” Holte said. “She is really going to be an asset for us as a senior class to keep this leadership.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Moments before her first Ivy League Championship final in late February, freshman Geordie Enoch stood behind the blocks, going through her last minute pre-race routine. She performed a quick quad stretch—a movement she had done hundreds of times before—and in doing so, aggravated an injury that had plagued her earlier in the season.
Exactly 2:00.66 later, Enoch exited Blodgett Pool as the Ivy League champion in the 200 individual medley nonetheless. Building on the victory, the Odenton, Md., native added another gold in the 400 IM and a bronze in the 200 breaststroke over the course of the weekend, earning the title of 2015 Ivy League High Point Swimmer of the Meet.
“What pushed me through our championship meet was having the adrenaline of every race and seeing our teammates behind every block,” Enoch said. “It was a lot of motivation. It gets you outside of your own head.”
Working through injury was hardly anything new for Enoch. At the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, Enoch competed in just one race while nursing a quad injury. But even with her constraints, Enoch left the pool with a first place finish in the 200 IM.
Despite achieving many of her best results in the individual medley, Enoch has competed in a variety of different races over the course of the season, including the 100 breast and the 500 freestyle, in which she placed third at her first collegiate meet.
“It’s just another mental challenge,” Enoch said. “I just take it one race at a time. If it’s a shorter race, I’ll just go all out, as fast as I can go, and I don’t hold back. But if it’s a long race, you have to adjust your mindset to be more technical and focused.”
The freshman has excelled outside the Ivy League as well. Less than a month into her Crimson career, Enoch took to the pool at the Texas Invitational. She ended the day with a seventh-place finish in the 400 IM, touching the wall in 4:19.60. Her itinerary also included the 200 IM, the 200 breast and the 200 back, in which she finished ninth, 16th, and 21st, respectively.
“[Competing in invitationals] drives you to remember that there’s a whole other level of competition,” Enoch said. “We’re not just competing in our own little bubble. There are bigger goals than that.”
Aside from Enoch’s diverse repertoire of events and week-to-week consistency, one of the swimmer’s most impressive qualities has been her ability to transition from high school to college swimming seamlessly.
Enoch cited her teammates, who emailed her over the summer and filled her in on the ins and outs of campus life, as vital in her transition to Harvard.
“If we’re going to swim fast, we need to have the whole person happy and healthy,” Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 said. “I can’t have someone who’s just fast in the pool because at some point, they’re not going to be fast if they’re not healthy and happy. It catches up with them.”
The ability to balance her various commitments with grace is a factor Morawski believes has made Enoch’s first college season so successful. Her unrelenting work ethic both inside and outside the pool has enabled her to improve her times.
“She works really hard in the weight room,” Morawski said. “She really had gone above and beyond in the little things that will help her make herself better.”
Nonetheless, Enoch attributes much of her success to the supportive familial environment of the team.
“They’ve been a great support system,” Enoch said. “Any time anyone is having a bad day, you can just look to the people around you, and they’ll motivate you and encourage you.”
After Enoch amassed five first-place finishes as a rookie despite having to overcome her first major injury, Morawski acknowledged that it is hard to imagine just how far the rising sophomore can go in her next three seasons swimming for the Crimson.
“I look at [Enoch] as a leader,” Morawski said. “She’s in the water as a very fast swimmer, she’s been a vocal leader as well, and she’s incredibly coachable. I can’t wait to work with her again next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For some athletes, collegiate competition is not enough.
Freshman sabre fencer Eli Dershwitz came to Harvard with the full knowledge that he would be taking a break from the team after his freshman season. And while competing for the Harvard team has presented a unique set of challenges and opportunities for Dershwitz, who faced defeat at the NCAA championships, the year has served as another stepping stone towards an even bigger goal—making the U.S. Olympic fencing team.
“We knew when we recruited him that this was the plan,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “He was very upfront about this, [and he] has a great chance of making the U.S. Olympic team. He fought like crazy for us this year...and he was an amazing performer, not only for himself, but also for the entire team.”
Now in the middle of an Olympic qualifying journey, Dershwitz ranks third in USA Fencing’s national rolling points standings for senior men’s sabre, behind 2012 Olympic team members Daryl Homer and Jeff Spear. Only two individuals per country in the sabre weapon will be able to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Dershwitz will take a leave from Harvard over the next year to train and fight for one of those spots.
But with the qualification process not coming to a close until April 2016, Dershwitz and his direct competition still have a long way to go on the road to the Games.
THE HARVARD GAP YEAR
While some Harvard students take a year off before college and others take time off in the middle of their educational careers, Dershwitz arrived at the College already intending to leave after his freshman season to pursue his Olympic aspirations. Even though he did enjoy considerable success fencing at the collegiate level this year, his ultimate focus did not change.
“I’ve had the same goal in mind really for a long time now,” Dershwitz said. “It’s been quite a few years since I realized that I had the potential to reach a certain level of athletic ability…. I think that taking a year off next year and training is an opportunity that I can’t pass up.”
While most sports at Harvard rarely see first-year athletes rise to national prominence so quickly, the fencing team has bucked that trend. Before Dershwitz, there was Adrienne Jarocki, who marched her way through the NCAA championships in 2014 to win the individual title in the sabre.
Dershwitz initially took a similar path as Jarocki did at the NCAA championships, finishing with 22 victories in pool play to qualify as the top seed in the final four, but his season would end in disappointment. Fourth-seeded Ferenc Valkai of St. John’s University, whom Dershwitz had defeated previously in pool play, took advantage of the Harvard fencer’s mistakes to win by a 15-11 score.
Dershwitz made it to the podium with bronze, finishing the year with an 84-14 record and a plus-234 touch differential. He also went 15-0 at the Ivy League Round Robins to propel the Crimson to a share of the Ivy League title.
“It’s incredible to train with a guy like him; he’s so knowledgeable about the sport,” junior co-captain Duncan O’Brien said. “I’m the team captain, but I’ll be looking at him [to see] how I can be doing better as a fencer, how we can train differently, [and] what needs to be done.”
His first season may appear impressive in isolation, but in the context of Dershwitz’s international career, it represents just another pin on the lapel. He has already been decorated dozens of times on the world stage, once after a recent gold medal-winning performance at the first Olympic qualifying event in Santiago, Chile. There, Dershwitz defeated both Homer and Spear to claim the title for the second consecutive year.
ROAD TO QUALIFICATION
To qualify as an individual to represent the Stars and Stripes at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Dershwitz will have to surpass Homer or Spear in the rankings to become one of the top two fencers in America. Otherwise, he will have to finish among the top 14 fencers in the International Fencing Federation’s adjusted rankings to achieve his dream.
According to Brand, only one other American Crimson fencer has qualified as a starter for the Olympic Games in the modern era—Emily Cross, who won a silver medal as a part of the U.S. Olympic women’s foil team at the 2008 Games in Athens, Greece.
“I don’t think the odds of me making the team is the best way to put it,” Dershwitz said. “At the level I’m at now, I feel like if I’m able to focus on my goal, I have the ability to put myself in a really good place for qualifying for the team.”
Brand normally tells his fencers to be patient and fence their collegiate careers before embarking on an Olympic run post-graduation. But there are some exceptions.
“It’s very difficult to take a year off,” Brand said. “Unless you’re ranked in the top three already nationally; [then] that makes sense. Eli is ranked third currently, so that makes sense.”
TALENTED BEYOND HIS YEARS
Though Dershwitz has only fenced for the Crimson for a year, the sabre specialist has impressed coaches and teammates alike with his poise on and off the strip. As his teammate at both the private fencing club Zeta and at Harvard, O’Brien has observed Dershwitz’s abilities since their youth.
“I’ve fenced with him since I was in seventh grade and he was in fifth grade, so I’ve seen that it’s been a long process from him just being a little kid to moving up in the ranks,” O’Brien said. “I remember in high school, he’d come an hour early to every practice to practice basic technique, basic footwork—the stuff that most people will just practice 10 or 15 minutes on during practice—[but] he’ll spend hours on it outside [of practice].”
Though Brand may be deprived of his best men’s sabre fencer next year, he is fully behind Dershwitz’s aspirations.
“He’s extremely mature, very caring about his teammates,” Brand said. “He’s a team player who came in and gave us everything he had. To that extent, I’m very happy for him, and absolutely supportive of him taking the year off next year.”
Dershwitz primarily competes on the senior circuit now; having been born in 1995, he is among the youngest fencers at the top of the U.S. leaderboard. Homer and Spear, who rank first and second, were born in 1990 and 1988, respectively.
Though both Homer and Spear have already competed for the U.S. Olympic team, what they do not have is a current college student’s perspective, something that Dershwitz believes is to his advantage.
“I think the fact that I’m a part of [the Harvard] team and also in school gives me a unique perspective,” Dershwitz said. “I feel like I really take advantage of my time and am able to focus very well on the drills at hand or the practice at hand…. I really feel that I’m able to take advantage of every practice, every lift and use it to my advantage at the spot where I am now.”
After coming to Harvard on visits and seeing the team in action, Dershwitz found a supportive cast of characters on campus.
“I really feel that the family aspect that we have [on the Harvard team] is a great attraction,” Dershwitz said. “That’s one of the big things that led me to pick Harvard over other schools—[that] family feel.”
Just as he left the comfort of home to come to Harvard, Dershwitz will have to leave the Crimson temporarily as he strives for greater achievements. With international qualifying events flying him across the world, Harvard will have to wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season that saw the Harvard men’s ice hockey team return to national prominence, the Crimson offense tallied 3.27 goals per game, the highest mark in the ECAC. In addition to having an eye for the back of the net, Harvard’s five highest-scoring forwards all shared another thing in common: They all played junior hockey prior to arriving in Cambridge.
With their sights on junior hockey programs both in the United States and Canada, some promising ice hockey prospects leave home early—usually during the later stages of high school—to maximize their chances of playing hockey at the collegiate or professional level. The majority of players currently listed on Harvard’s roster took this route prior to suiting up for the Crimson.
The practice is not unique to Harvard, the Ivy League, or the ECAC, however. These expansive development leagues, including the United States Hockey League (USHL) and the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), have made this experience commonplace in the ice hockey world. Many players on the Harvard team credit their junior hockey experiences with improving their collegiate and professional prospects as well as critical aspects of their personal growth.
The junior leagues, which mostly feature players ages 16-20, offer the best players in the country a place to develop before enrolling in college. Typically, the athletes who participate leave home to compete for a minor league team stationed miles away and live with a host family in the area. The experience can also involve attending a local high school, as it did in the case of freshman Jake Horton, who spent nearly his entire high school career playing in junior leagues.
Horton cited the challenge of competing at a higher level, primarily against older players, as one of the driving factors behind his choice to play junior hockey. After making his junior hockey debut at the end of his sophomore year of high school, Horton noted that he was forced to develop significantly as a player simply to earn ice time. Along the way, he learned the “little things” that were needed at higher levels of competition.
“I [was] a prima donna type player in high school where all I wanted to do is score goals,” Horton said. “I went to junior hockey [where] you’re a 15-year-old playing with 20 and 21-year-olds, and I wanted to find a way to make myself useful to the coach. I learned how to play defense, [and] I learned how to do all the little things right and focus on the fundamentals.”
Seb Lloyd, Horton’s classmate and occasional Crimson linemate, said that one of the biggest benefits junior hockey provided him had to do with physical development. Playing against some opponents that often were two and three years older—as he would have to do continually as a college freshman—Lloyd focused on bulking up and building his strength to be able to stay on the ice against more physical players.
“You are playing against older guys, so you have to mature physically and work hard off the ice and get strong so you can stay healthy enough to play and contribute,” Lloyd said.
Both players also credited the program with helping to add to their emotional resiliency. Junior hockey players typically stay with “billet” families that serve as their homes away from home. However, while these groups provide familial structure, both Lloyd and Horton said that they still had to learn how to function more maturely.
“Your billet parents aren’t driving you around or lending you money—it teaches you to be independent,” Lloyd said. “The main thing a billet should do is teach you to live on your own while still having that family atmosphere in a way.”
According to sophomore Tyler Moy, the billet family structure prepared him for the transition to college. Moy grew very close with his junior hockey roommate, noting that their billet parents served as a “second family” in mentoring both him and his roommate while Moy played for the Omaha Lancers of the USHL.
“Living with the billet family was a huge plus for me because they gave us the structure a normal family would have, [but] we also had to develop ourselves and create a sort of independence during that time,” Moy said. “In college, other than professors and tutors, you are just living with other kids your age…. Just having that structure to rely on was a very nice touch.”
Horton said that the independence proved crucial in his educational development as well. While admitting that in high school he felt like a “big fish in a small pond,” Horton said that he learned to hold himself to a higher standard because of the fact that there was nobody else looking out for him.
“I became very mentally tough and was able to find a way [to] not get overwhelmed at Harvard,” Horton said. “It definitely prepared me from a mental toughness standpoint to handle adversity.”
When comparing juniors to its most common alternative, prep school hockey, all three players acknowledged that the two certainly have their differences. Most notably, there is a tradeoff that pits the quality of play, which is much higher in juniors, against the ability to receive a more traditional high school experience by attending a prep school. Horton commented that his teams’ demanding travel schedules made it hard to share some of the same experiences as his classmates.
“You end up missing a good portion of the high school experience because you aren’t going to football games, [and] you aren’t going to dances,” Horton said. “You are confined to that small group of guys on your team.... You don’t have the same support group.”
Lloyd noted that in his case, the benefits far outweighed the consequences. Growing up in Prince George, British Columbia, the forward was not just choosing between junior hockey and high school—he was deciding whether or not to make a jump to the pros.
Lloyd opted against moving to a league like the Western Hockey League (WHL), instead choosing to play junior hockey for the West Kelowna Warriors of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), so that he could maintain his amateur eligibility.
“I had a lot of friends in the WHL getting paid to play already, but my payment is getting the opportunity to play college hockey at a place that I wouldn’t be able to play otherwise,” Lloyd said.
Moy echoed many of the same sentiments, noting that junior hockey pitted him against the best players in his age group and provided him with the best possible preparation for college ice hockey. Playing in a town where junior hockey was one of the primary sporting attractions, Moy believes that his team got more support than any prep school team would.
“[Our building] was 80 percent full every night, and it was a thing that everyone wants to go out there [for],” Moy said. “You got to be a fan favorite and sign autographs after.... In that sense, it’s like you’re a pro. It’s a great lifestyle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 13, 2012, Harvard and Yale took to Jordan Field for a matchup that had been in the making for over a century.
In response to a challenge issued in 1887 to the Elis by the Harvard Cricket Association through The Crimson, the Bulldogs finally accepted. And for a moment, the cricket team—one of Harvard’s 66 student-run club sports teams—could claim that it would play in its own edition of “The Game.”
From aikikai to archery, water polo to wushu, Harvard club sports run the gamut of interests, experience, and athletic skill levels found across campus.
According to a survey of the freshman Class of 2017 conducted by The Crimson, 69 percent of incoming students who responded reported that they played a sport in high school. However, less than 13 percent of respondents said that they had been recruited for one of Harvard’s 42 varsity teams.
For the sizable portion of high school athletes who were not recruited, club sports offer a chance to remain involved in athletic pursuits without requiring the same level of commitment that is necessary at the varsity level.
Harvard’s club teams operate with fewer resources—be it time, money, or personnel—than varsity programs do. Nonetheless, they sometimes represent the College at competitions where regional, conference, and even national championships are on the line.
The Harvard Cricket Club advanced to the national tournament this year after posting one of its best seasons in modern program history, dropping just one game during the regular season and defeating the defending Ivy League champion, Penn, in a closely contested title game.
In the tournament, the team was ousted after receiving a difficult draw in the round robin stage against opponents that would eventually finish first and third. Through the season, however, the club was ranked as high as third in the country and saw two players, sophomore Vivek Jayaram and junior captain Manik Kuchroo, earn All-American honors.
The team enjoys its club status, but operating logistics has spawned the team’s desire to transition to a varsity sport.
“We [think we] are on a path to go varsity in the next couple of years,” Kuchroo said. “[I am] not entirely sure when it will happen but hopefully in the next decade or two…. [Club status] doesn’t really hinder the club—just more control is given to the students.”
The junior believes switching to varsity, should it happen, would lead to the disappearance of some of the challenges he says his team regularly faces.
“Access to field space is a huge thing,” Jayaram said. “During the winter, our practice time in the bubble is 9 p.m. to 12 midnight on Friday nights. It is hard to expand the club memberships when only the most dedicated players would give up their Friday nights to play.”
Another team that has retained its club status for over a century is the Harvard Rugby Football Club, which was founded in 1872 and claims to be the oldest of its kind in the United States. In 1874, the team competed against McGill University in the first rugby game ever to be played and documented in America, kickstarting a legacy of high-level competition.
While the women’s rugby team just completed its second year as a varsity team, the men’s team has remained a club. Differences now exist between the teams in the quality of training and the financial resources possessed, but the men’s team still receives some support from the Athletic Department as a club.
Today, the male ruggers train approximately twice a week, depending on the season, with near-weekly games during the fall season and intermittent competition in the spring. Many students who join the team have played either rugby or football before, but plenty of others have not.
While members of the men’s rugby team sometimes have prior experience, that is almost never the case for one of Harvard’s newer club sports—quidditch. Based on the sport from the Harry Potter series, quidditch recently has grown popular on a number of college campuses, including Harvard’s.
The Harvard Horntails compete with teams from both the surrounding area and further afield. The team was founded in 2009, becoming Harvard’s first co-ed contact sport—a mix of rugby, dodgeball, and handball.
“People tend to not start playing until they get to college,” sophomore manager Cassie Lowell said. “If they have played quidditch before then, it’s very rare, unless it’s just throwing around a broom and a ball.”
Despite the paucity of experienced quidditch players, the team has already taken steps forward in competition. The Horntails recently switched to a more competitive league, the Massachusetts Quidditch Conference, and they recorded two victories at this year’s U.S. Quidditch World Cup in April.
As members commit increased amounts of time and energy to quidditch, one new issue has had much to do with travel. The Horntails make the trek to two tournaments a year, including the World Cup, which was held this year in South Carolina.
“Just the travel expenses to take 20 people to those places [are] enormous,” sophomore captain Zac Bathen said. “That’s where we see most of our budget problems. As more and more clubs become club sports, and club sports emerge, everyone gets less money, and we’ve definitely felt that.”
The Horntails aren’t the only club sport to feel the burden of funding sometimes costly travel. Red Line and Quasar, the men’s and women’s ultimate frisbee teams, respectively, have both played in the regional tournament in recent years, and have aspirations to compete in the national championship.
“Over the past three or four years, the program has been on the rise,” Quasar captain India Stubbs said. “[The program is] building in size, strength, and national rank, [and] I believe that the team is in a great spot to keep improving and become even more competitive next year.”
In order to satisfy their ambitions, Stubbs stressed, the team has to travel across the country for tournaments. The men’s team has adapted by starting an endowment intended to help lower the costs of competition.
“I think that ultimate in particular relies more on money in order to grow as a program and to compete at a higher level,” Stubbs said, “which I know is a challenge for both the men’s and the women’s teams.”
With so many club sports offered at Harvard, it is inevitable that teams will face these kinds of challenges that their varsity counterparts typically avoid. But despite the difficulties, through competition and sense of community, club sports constitute a vital aspect of Harvard student life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 When I was graduating from Harvard in the 1980s, Kermit the Frog was our Class Day speaker. It doesn't get more memorable than that. And yet, though I do remember seeing him perform on the stage in Sanders Theatre (behind a draped table turned on its side), I don't recall a single word of the good advice he surely gave us that day (“Go green?” "Look before you leap?" "Find your rainbow connection?” Who can say?)
In contrast, I recall vividly the advice that our illustrious Commencement speaker—none other than Mother Theresa—gave in her speech to us that year, but only because her words jarred so much with my sense of the occasion. All of us were in awe of the thought of being addressed by some kind of future saint, and expected her to speak in inspiring cadences about the meaning of a life dedicated to service.
Instead, she told us not to have sex before marriage. She then went on to say that "if a mistake is made," we should "keep the baby." Here we were, imagining that we were about to head out of Harvard Yard to become world-changers, and her words seemed designed to reduce us to ashamed teenagers.
It turns out, therefore, that while inspirational advice is a much-anticipated and possibly necessary part of the ritual of Commencement, it is also very possible that you will not remember very much of it in later years—or that you will remember some of it, but not for the reasons that the speaker intended. If this is true, then what does endure? What are you more likely to remember? Speaking largely from my own undergraduate experience, here are a few possibilities:
Your experiences of intellectual expansion: In the fall of my freshman year, one of my senior and urbane professors happened to finish up his lecture a few minutes early, and said that he would be happy to take a few questions. I was sitting way in the back of the lecture hall, where I thought I would be safely invisible. Nevertheless, I worked up the courage to raise my hand, expose my ignorance, and ask a question. Before he answered, he said something that meant the world to me. He said, “What a good question!” And these words subtly but powerfully changed me forever. It was my first inkling that college might not just be about stuff you were supposed to know or learn, but also about unknown stuff that you could find out about.
Your experiences of humbling: Harvard was also the place where I received my first-ever “C” grade on an assignment. To make things worse, the grade was given for a creative writing assignment, a genre of work in which I had previously won awards. I had been a secret snob about my skills in this area, and now I realized I was not such a hot shot after all. I went home and cried, but I survived this blow to my ego, my GPA barely suffered, and my writing improved. I also grew up a little.
Your experiences of kind people: By the time I was a senior, the big questions that fascinated me were coming into focus. I was feeling a strong vocational pull toward graduate school and becoming an academic. But I was also worried that this was a selfish choice, a retreat from tackling the terrible real-world dilemmas that my generation faced (in particular, in those waning years of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear holocaust).
At some point, I asked a professor whose social activism I admired what he thought. He listened to my question, but he did not answer it. Instead, he said: “Let’s go have lunch.” He took me out for a hamburger at Bartley’s Burgers and talked about how things had been for him, and how they might be for me. By the end of that lunch, without ever directly telling me what to do, he had left me feeling that it would be possible to pursue a career path that I could love while still taking responsibility for making the world a safer, better place.
And so I did.
Writing down these memories, what strikes me about them is how specific they are. Of course they are. They’re mine. Yours will be equally specific. But even as that is so, I suspect that, for many of you also, what will endure long after the speeches have been forgotten (if you even paid attention to them in the first place), will be memories of those moments in college when, for whatever reason, you became a slightly better version of yourself.
As I was finishing up these remarks, I asked my 10-year-old son if he had any thoughts about what to tell the graduating seniors who might read this essay. His reply was: “Tell them they need to get an apartment. And that they should play a lot of soccer.” I include his advice, since it’s as good as any. Especially since none of you are likely to remember it anyway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 Diversity. It is a principle that today’s society values greatly—a sign of virtue, moral progress, and greater social inclusivity. Politicians, corporations, media outlets, and especially universities like Harvard pursue diversity by trying to attract and retain professors, students, administrators, and workers from every race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, and faith.
This endeavor to achieve perfect diversity started out with good intentions: Women, blacks, and gays in this country were the victims of vicious discrimination for centuries. It was a liberal project derived from the most basic of liberal principles: the rights and freedoms of the individual to choose his or her own destiny.
Since the country’s founding, America has fought to make this utopian vision, enshrined in the Constitution, a reality. And Americans rose to the challenge: a civil war was fought to abolish slavery; a suffrage movement expanded voting rights; a civil rights movement ended segregation, if not racism. We have it hardwired in us to seek out injustice, expose it, and defend the rights of its victims. We have corrected some injustices through legislation and education. We are still working to address others.
Yet somehow we have got so caught up in the pursuit of diversity that we have drifted away from the core of what it was all about, the core of liberalism: the individual.
Instead of struggling and campaigning for the freedoms and rights of the individual, some of us seem more focused on the freedoms and rights of the group.
Some of us seem to have forgotten that, while being female or gay or black or Muslim can give us a sense of shared experience and collective identity, we should be fighting harder for the individual than for any group. The greatest overarching identity that liberalism exalts above all others is humanity. We should be fighting for the individual not simply because he or she belongs to this or that minority, but because we are all human.
What is most troubling to me is that the shift from the individual to the group has created a situation where individuals within minority groups are actually being hurt. We need to recognize that not all diversity is good; some is downright bad.
It is not good for the individual, for example, when diversity means accepting harmful traditional practices against women, or religious sanctioning of child marriage, or shariah laws that criminalize rape victims and dissidents.
Such practices are too often defended in the name of cultural diversity. In the process, the vulnerable get left in the shadows. They are often (though not exclusively) children, women, gays, and blacks. They are also those who speak critically about their religion or who choose to leave their faith because aspects of it contradict their individual sense of morality.
The identity politics of our time has created a language of political correctness that sometimes verges on censorship. We have allowed the voice of the group, or whoever claims to represent the group, not only to speak for the individual, but sometimes to shout down the individual if his or her story does not fit with an approved narrative.
We claim to fight for women’s rights, but we are not supposed to talk about the immense suffering of women in the Middle East because that might be construed as being offensive to Muslims. We are witnessing a major cultural shift in support for gay marriage across the West, but Iran remains beyond our criticism, even as the regime hangs gays, because that might be condemned as Islamophobic.
Worse still, those who speak out against these injustices are vilified and accused of “bigotry.”
The rights enshrined in the First Amendment were once upheld by proponents of liberalism, like the women of the Seneca Falls Convention who wrote the Declaration of Sentiments, or Dr. Martin Luther King in his civil rights speeches. Their words were politically incorrect in the eyes of many at that time. But the First Amendment was not written into our constitution to protect the status quo—it was written into the constitution to allow for criticism of those in power and to foster the diversity of ideas.
Those today who seek to limit free speech in the name of diversity are betraying true liberalism. Liberalism means standing up for the rights of every individual regardless of race, ethnicity, class, faith, gender, or sexual orientation. It means condemning oppression regardless of the form it takes and the cultural justifications given for it. It means recognizing that it is the individual who has rights and freedoms, it is the individual who suffers discrimination, and it is the individual we should be fighting to protect.
As a black woman and an immigrant, I am all for diversity. Who isn’t? But I care more for individual freedom. For, in a truly free society, our group identities should diminish, not increase, in their importance.
That, not the entrenchment of historic differences, should be our goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stepping onto the grounds of Harvard Business School, Paul J. Zofnass ’69 knew what to look for—a large poster of himself. And there it stood. Fastened to a lamppost under an overhanging tree and next to the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship hung Zofnass smiling in what he calls his “stupid-looking way.”
“I’m merging my vocational interests with my avocational passions, particularly with regard to the environment and conservation,” the glossy canvas read.
Zofnass was in Cambridge for a board meeting at the Mount Auburn Cemetery when a Harvard affiliate told him to take a trip across the Charles River to see the poster, one of many inspirational messages scattered across the campus featuring alumni “Making A Difference” with their Business School education.
Posters and testimonials, both in print and online, are just a couple examples of how Harvard showcases faculty research and University life in the midst of its ongoing capital campaign. Across the University, communications staffs have ramped up their efforts to promote the Harvard’s $6.5 billion fundraising drive—its most ambitious campaign and a would-be record for higher education—pulling out all the stops to target alumni and collect every last dollar.
With celebrities, lavish alumni gatherings, and polished publications, Harvard holds nothing back. In 2013, the most recent year for which public tax forms have been released, the University spent nearly $170 million on fundraising. And Harvard’s strategy goes beyond the money, utilizing targeted promotion and strategic communications.
ALL THE BELLS, ALL THE WHISTLES
Less than half a mile from Harvard Yard on the sixth floor of University Place sits the office of Alumni Affairs and Development, the helm of fundraising strategy. The team is pulling out all the stops to promote the campaign, and it’s spending a lot of money doing it. In 2013, Harvard spent $167,510,150 on total fundraising expenses, according to Internal Revenue Service tax filings. Big money brings big results, according to Peter L. Malkin ’55, a member of the Committee on University Resources—an advisory group composed of elite Harvard donors.
“I think it's necessary to mobilize the University community,” Malkin said. “By that I mean the tens of thousands of graduates and also to get the message out to people who have no direct connection to Harvard to get them more interested and supportive.”
Through many platforms, the Harvard Alumni Affairs office maintains a regimented communications strategy. Online, brightly colored websites glide through images of alumni and professors explaining their work, while individual schools’ websites outline campaign initiatives including financial aid, undergraduate House renewal, and faculty scholarship.
University President Drew G. Faust, more than any previous president, has put a global emphasis on her fundraising drive. Presenting what she calls the “Your Harvard” event series, Faust has traveled the world to meet with donors, visiting Dallas, Mexico City, Seattle, Beijing, and Chicago just this academic year. These events have drawn significant crowds—nearly 400 alumni and guests turned out the event in Chicago earlier in May, which featured talks from Faust, prominent alumni, and professors. Last year’s “Your Harvard” event in New York was held on a decommissioned aircraft carrier and attracted about 600 Harvard supporters.
“It’s always a thrill for the people participating, and it reminds us of some of the extraordinary graduates Harvard has had,” Faust said about the capital campaign.
“She is very open to traveling and not ignoring the outside world, which I think some her predecessors may have done,” former Board of Overseers president Leila Fawaz said of Faust. “She is aware there is a world out there, and she has been very active working with HAA and people who are influential to become involved.”
Not stopping at organizing global alumni events, the team at AA&D has also tapped into its celebrity alumni pool, including cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and Microsoft co-founder and former Harvard student Bill Gates to draw crowds. Ma performed at last fall’s launch of the Graduate School of Education’s fundraising drive, and Gates spoke at the launch of the University-wide campaign in September 2013.
For some of the University’s top donors, the strategy, for all its glamour, not only makes sense but is also effective. By the latest public count, the campaign has reached the $5 billion mark, and some have speculated that officials may raise the $6.5 billion target.
“I don’t think it’s excessive. In order to raise $6.5 billion…you need to pull out all the stops and put on your best marketing hat,” said Mitchell L. Dong ’75, a member of the Committee on University Resources. “President Faust will go out there to give the pitch… You go out there and beat the bushes and pound the pavement and rally the troops and do everything it takes.”
POSITIVE MESSAGES 
A central component of Harvard’s fundraising strategy is outreach, which includes coordinating messages and working with the media who cover Harvard.
“The major unwritten law is to avoid bad publicity, and I think that the University has been quite skillful under President Faust in staying out of the headlines in a bad way…and most of the stories are stories that make people feel good,” said Howard E. Gardner ’65, a professor at the Graduate School of Education who has taught across the University for almost three decades.
Peter Der Manuelian, a Harvard professor and Egyptology expert who has spoken at a number of campaign events, said he works with Harvard communications staff to tailor his presentation to fit the event program, whether they want him to talk about the technology he has pioneered to visualize Egyptian pyramids or his role as the curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum.
Harvard officials sometimes directly facilitate these conversations. This was the case when Michael M. Lynton '82 prepared remarks for a School of Engineering and Applied Sciences event last year, according to email correspondence published by Wikileaks. Lynton, who is on the Board of Overseers and CEO at Sony Pictures Entertainment, emailed Roger Cheever ’67, an associate vice president for alumni affairs and development, asking for speech suggestions. One day later, Cheever responded with remarks for Lynton that, according to the email, Sophie Burke of Alumni Affairs and Development had prepared.
“These talking points are suggested – you have creative license. You should feel free to edit or change them how you wish,” the email read.
When it comes time to shape the campaign’s public face, AA&D also works with Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, especially when it comes time to announce landmark gifts. HPAC spokespeople led the February 2014 rollout of a $150 million gift from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, as well as the announcement of Gerald L. Chan’s $350 million pledge in September 2014, generating press coverage—and a platform for Faust to extol Harvard’s mission—in campus, local, and national media outlets. 
“HPAC’s role is largely in helping us work with external media around large gift announcements,” Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74, writing in an email, said of her office’s relationship with Harvard’s public relations outfit.
“At the launch of the Campaign in 2013, President Faust described the University’s aspirations for the future,” Rogers added. “We work hard to share that vision with our alumni and friends around the world.”

For all its changes, the role of the president remains a position requiring a vision and novel ideas about improving the University.
At Commencement, in stark contrast to faculty and students clad in academic regalia, University President Drew G. Faust will don the ancient and spartan black robes of Puritan clergy—traditional attire that harkens back to an earlier age, before the modern era of the Harvard presidency. 
Since the 17th century, the position of the president of Harvard has undergone vast changes. In particular, the modernization of the American university—and the accompanying changes in role and structure—over the past half-century have led to the imposition of various constraints on the powers of the president, presenting new and ever-changing challenges for the man or woman who has occupied that position. Despite the changes, University President Drew G. Faust has been at the cutting edge of meeting these new challenges and of juggling the various responsibilities of the presidency.
According to Stephen P. Shoemaker, who teaches a course called Harvard’s History and Evolving Religious Identity, Harvard presidents once were tasked with upholding religious orthodoxy in a time when Harvard’s principal objective was training clergymen. But in the 19th century, Harvard began its move away from focusing on religious education in earnest with the appointment of its second lay president, Josiah Quincy, in 1829. 
This shift away from religious training was solidified during Charles W. Eliot’s 40-year presidency from 1869-1909, which marked the greatest turning point toward the modern Harvard presidency. In a debate with Princeton President James McCosh, Eliot broke with precedent and argued that Harvard should not be associated with a particular religious denomination, much to the chagrin of McCosh, who said that Harvard should change its motto to, “All knowledge imparted here except religious.” Though the presidency and the University have remained firmly secular since Eliot’s reign, both have undergone dramatic changes in the intervening century. 
Previous Harvard presidents have served as strong drivers of academic progress both on campus and nationally—a mantle that is no longer possible. In an interview with The Crimson, Faust argued that the additional power claimed by the faculty has forced a change in the president’s academic responsibilities. 
In part to prevent the poaching of faculty members by rival institutions of higher education, the University granted ever-increasing degrees of freedom and power to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—a wise shift, since the faculty must execute the curriculum. Nevertheless, a more powerful FAS leaves the president with less prerogative to control the curriculum. Instead, for Faust, the president’s role is one of persuasion and leadership, but not the overt control exercised by her predecessors. This is a promising shift for the presidency’s future. 
In other areas, the presidency’s responsibilities have grown more significantly. Perhaps the most obvious change has been in fundraising. Though the president has had to coordinate and raise money for the whole University even from the beginning of former University President Derek C. Bok’s first term in 1971, the development apparatus of the University has grown exponentially since then. 
At the beginning of Bok’s first term, the University employed fewer than ten fundraising professionals; when Bok returned in 2006, he was asked to address a group of development officers large enough to fill a small theater. While the role of a university president at most other institutions across the nation has long been chiefly focused on fundraising—with academic responsibilities often delegated to a provost—this has not been the case at Harvard, where the president has always had final say on all faculty tenure decisions. 
Going forward, the fundraising responsibilities of the Harvard president must not come at the expense of his or her ability to provide academic leadership for the University. In her time as president, Faust has done an admirable job of balancing these competing roles as an academic and as a fundraiser, even as the current needs of the University have increased her presence as the public face of Harvard. 
This focus will surely become much more prominent in the coming months when the faculty beings to address perceived failings in the General Education Program. In her role as chair of the meetings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that will ultimately decide what this program will look like going forward, Faust has an opportunity to cement her legacy of academic leadership at Harvard. 
After all, the legacy of every Harvard president is eventually condensed into a short blurb—a few paragraphs published by the University detailing his or her major accomplishments as president of Harvard. Presidents like Eliot and Lowell are remembered by history for their ability to shape the future of undergraduate education. While the office has changed significantly in the past hundred years, Faust has the unique opportunity to use the General Education debate to show the University and the world that the Harvard presidency is still an academic office at its heart.
And while it is true that Faust’s predecessor, Derek Bok, played a different, more proactive role in formulating the Program in General Education during the 2006-07 school year, the unusual circumstances of Bok’s interim year dictated that assertiveness. In addition to believing the debate needed to be settled as quickly as possible, Bok had published a book on undergraduate education, entitled “Our Underachieving Colleges,” only a year before being unexpectedly recalled to the presidency and thrust into the middle of the curriculum debate. 
Given the differing situations, it would be impossible and unrealistic to expect Faust to dictate the terms of the upcoming curricular reforms. By clearly setting her objectives and working with the faculty to achieve them, Faust has the potential to exercise the type of visionary presidential leadership that works in the 21st century.
In truth, there can be no doubt that the role of the president remains a position for someone who has a vision—and smart, novel ideas about improving the University and its constituent schools—even if there is no have a place for a single-minded, idealistic innovator. 
The advancements in affordability and inclusivity in recent years are a testament to President Faust’s vision. Under her tenure, Harvard has expanded the financial aid program, reinstated the Navy Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, and spearheaded the House Renewal project. In the context of a 21st century research institution, the ability to conceive and enact decisive changes with faculty cooperation and involvement is crucial—it is the pinnacle of modern presidential leadership. 
Just as the University itself has undergone tremendous changes since its founding nearly 400 years ago, its presidency has also taken on a vastly different set of responsibilities and roles. Unlike in past years, the modern president must contend with the tremendous size in population, geography, and spirit of the University and its schools and faculties, and the corresponding bureaucratic complexities. The president must balance competing responsibilities to fundraise, administrate, educate, lead, and persuade. In short, it is a more difficult, fluid, and complicated office than ever before. 
In President Faust, we have a leader who is well suited to juggling these tasks. Going forward, even as fundraising and administrative burdens grow, the Harvard presidency should retain the core attributes that set it apart. And, if all goes well, the presidency will remain in the hands of an idealistic academic who cherishes the role he or she must play in defining and continually improving the Harvard undergraduate experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard first announced its new, University-wide sexual assault policies and procedures in July 2014, they were rightly hailed as a badly needed correction to a system that benefited neither the accuser nor the accused.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights had launched Title IX investigations at both Harvard College and Harvard Law School for their mishandling of sexual assault cases. Last March, an anonymous student’s heartbreaking and harrowing account of her rape and the administration’s failed response drew national attention to the College’s crisis.
The Administrative Board that adjudicated all disciplinary cases was shown to be yet again deeply flawed. Operating nebulously—never releasing even anonymized summaries of its proceedings, despite promising to do so five years ago—the Ad Board required complete confidentiality, limited student access to legal counsel, and decided cases on a “sufficiently persuaded” standard with no recognizable legal analogue.
But despite having some of the country’s most distinguished experts on administrative law just down the street, not a single law professor was consulted in the policies’ drafting—a major mistake. The Law School faculty learned of the sweeping changes in the media, just like everyone else.
The frustration came to the fore in October, when 28 prominent Law School professors, including former Dean of the Law School Robert Clark and Alan Dershowitz, published a damning op-ed in the Globe, slamming the University policy’s lack of due process, overly broad definition of sexual harassment, and threat to academic freedom.
Shortly after, a committee formed by Dean Martha L. Minow began work on new Law School-specific policies, a major break from the University’s goal of a single sexual harassment policy. Months later, the procedures were adopted by the Law School in December.
Although the policies Faust had announced in July were progress, they were far from perfect. For one, the University adopted the preponderance of evidence standard advocated by the Office for Civil Rights and favored by advocates. But it also centralized compliance, investigations, and enforcement in the newly created Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, or ODR, inviting the possibility of bias for officials seeking to limit damage to Harvard’s reputation at the expense of the best interests of students.
“Having the investigation carried out by somebody different than the person who is going to be deciding the truth of what happened….that’s important for, frankly, everyone,” said Professor John Coates, the law professor who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the Law School’s new policies.
There is “no separation of the judge, the prosecutor, and the investigator,” said Philip Heymann, a Law School professor who cosigned the Globe op-ed. In the University’s announced policies, “the central Harvard office will be the judge of the facts, will make the final determination of facts, which could not be reviewed by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences or the Law School.”
And though the University’s chief Title IX officer Mia Karvonides, who oversees ODR, insists that “people need to understand, to have trust and have confidence that this is an unbiased process,” the possibility of bias is often as damning as its appearance.
In an internal memo circulated by 20 Law School professors, most of whom were signatories to the Globe op-ed, it is noted that investigators must be “entirely free from influence by the Harvard administration.” Instead, reliable and independent fact-finders, such as judges or experienced, former law enforcement officials, should be kept on retainer to ensure the impartiality of the verdict.
On the issue of misplaced incentives, the University’s policy have a clear hole. A problem of possible bias in cases as significant as sexual harassment is unacceptable—and though the Law School’s procedures might be more expensive if implemented University-wide, they have the virtue of being more impartial to both the accuser and the accused.
The faculty committee was limited by the University to revising issues of procedure, not policy substance. And Coates’s blunt assessment that “the procedures the Law School came up with are better” is correct.
Under the University’s sexual harassment procedures, attorneys cannot be present during meetings and interviews. There are no live hearings. Parties cannot interrogate witnesses and challenge evidence being collected.
Those accused can “bring a personal advisor who happens to be an attorney (like a law professor), but that person has to be a university officer. But many students do not know personal advisors in the university who happen to be attorneys,” wrote Law School professor Jeannie Suk in an email response to written questions.
The Law School’s procedures correct for these deficiencies by granting access to legal counsel at all stages of the process, and paying for adequate counsel to those who cannot afford it. They grant hearings, allow for evidence to be responded to directly, and provide a path for appeal to both parties.
These procedures provide an even playing field to traditionally underprivileged groups.
“I’ve been aware of and involved in several Harvard cases, and the majority have been against black respondents,” Law School professor Janet Halley wrote in an email.
Though the Law School committee had to keep to the preponderance of evidence standard held by the University, the better standard of “clear and convincing evidence,” currently used in all Law School disciplinary proceedings, should be the one used University-wide.
Though substantive policy was beyond the ability of the committee to change, Law School professors still raise two serious objections to it—one more concerning the other.
The first points to the overly broad definition of sexual harassment about the ability of “impaired or incapacitated” persons to consent. The policy lacks a reasonable person standard that is found in most case law, and seems to imply that the “complainant may be incapable of consent by dint of that impairment while the same level of impairment gives [the] respondent no mitigation,” Suk wrote in an email.
“I’m terrified on behalf of college students,” said one professor who worried that the clause, without clarification, would sweep consensual sex between two students after moderate drinking into the category of sexual harassment.
Other professors indicated their worries that the policy would impinge on academic freedom, as discussions on rape law or hypotheticals involving gender or sex could be claimed to constitute harassment.
The University policy has a single line that claims no part of it shall be construed to abridge academic freedom and inquiry, while the Law School interim procedures spend several more lines elaborating. Though it seems far-fetched that the University would sanction an instructor for any academic discussion in the classroom, Coates seems right when he says that “it’s slightly embarrassing that it’s a single sentence.”
Despite its many faults, the University policy was certainly a step in the right direction. But though its deficits come not from ill will, they must still be rectified. The original error of the University was moving the policy forward without adequate consultation of the school’s faculty, especially those Law School faculty who might have a wise thing or two to say on the issue.
We could not locate a single law professor who had gone on the record in defense of the University’s policy and against the Law School’s new ones.
But the mistakes are not as important as the opportunity to improve in the future. Harvard Law School has constructed a process immensely better than the one governing the conduct of most Harvard students. It’s time to change that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students love to argue, but they can agree on one thing: Getting in wasn’t easy. This year’s admissions rate hit a record low at 5.3 percent. The year before, it was 5.9. Before that, 5.8.
The numbers seem formidably small, and Harvard as an institution seems just plain formidable. For one subset of students, however, the odds of admission nearly triple. Who are these lucky few? They are not the group of all students who boasted 4.0 GPAs in high school. They are not the group of all students who earned 2400s on their SATs. They are not even the group of all students who occupied top leadership positions on newspapers, or sports teams, or student councils. They are the group of all students who had at least one parent attend Harvard College.
Recently, legacy admissions have sparked less discussion on campus than affirmative action, or Harvard’s preferential treatment of athletes in admissions. No pending lawsuit alleges that legacy preference resulted in a student’s rejection, and no Supreme Court cases compliment or condemn the practice. But the advantage afforded to children of alumni is a glaring example of poor policy on Harvard’s part, one that flies in the face of fairness and one that only contributes to the College’s culture of valuing familial connections over individual achievement.
The preference Harvard awards the children of alumni offers a leg up to those who, in most cases, already started ahead of the pack. The admissions office claims that being the son or daughter of a Harvard alum only guarantees an applicant “an additional look,” a “tip factor,” a “thumb on the scale.” But that very heavy thumb translates into a chance of admission, according to research, that is roughly three times higher than the norm.
It is difficult to quantify exactly how much of the differential comes from legacy consideration and how much comes from qualifications that legacy applicants may have in spades. Legacy students have the opportunity to grow up in the bosom of the educational elite until they are old enough to become the elite themselves: In 2014, Harvard graduates reported among the highest-paying mid-careers in the country.
These privileged positions, in most cases, can help parents guide their children through the college application process, either with personal help or with paid support. This aid can lead to stellar test scores from expensive SAT and ACT tutoring, carefully pruned Common Applications and supplements from savvy college counselors, and the good word of a well-respected and established secondary school. If legacy students have these merits—regardless of where they came from—they should be, and oftentimes are, capable of getting into Harvard without systematic support.
The question of merit is not an easy one to answer. But for the purposes of college admissions, merit should measure what one does with the cards he or she has been dealt. Bright kids may have won the genetic lottery, and yet a superlative IQ does not guarantee matching grades or scores. Athletic kids may also have come out on top, and yet the potential to lift vast amounts or run vast distances means little without hours spent in the weight room or on the track. A Harvard legacy, however, does exactly the same thing at birth as it does 18 years later during application season, and no hard work need take place in the meantime. It is an automatic aid that neither asks for nor expects effort, dedication, or goodwill.
Harvard justifies legacy preference primarily with platitudes. The aim, the administration says, is to create a community that spans generations. The aim, in reality, is to create a community that donates money. The most compelling argument for continued legacy preference is an economic one: alumni are more likely to donate if they believe their contributions will help their children, and their children’s children, one day to walk through Johnston Gate.
Indeed, any school needs a robust fundraising program to thrive. Still, universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its California counterpart maintain an active alumni community without promising parents a concrete benefit to their generosity. There is no reason a school like Harvard—with an unparalleled endowment and an established system for carrying out effective financial campaigns—should prove unable to achieve on the same level as the MIT or Caltech, even without legacy preference as a donatory motivator.
Taken together, these considerations make clear that an admissions preference for the children of alumni offers only a marginal benefit to Harvard, and at the expense of justness and transparency.
The admissions system as a whole has flaws, ones that make it far easier for someone who has had the right tutoring and has gone to the right high school to get into Harvard than someone who entered the game with a worse hand. Getting rid of legacy preference, surely, will not fix these problems.
That is why some might allege that crusading to remove the advantage is naive. How does this policy lead to real change? Shouldn’t we focus on broader problems—income inequality, educational disparities, racial injustice? Isn’t simply eliminating the legacy preference a Band-Aid solution to the bullet-hole wound of Harvard’s lack of diversity?
Such criticisms are simply misguided. Harvard can and must work to address larger problems of socioeconomic injustice, and it should do so knowing that such injustice actively shapes its classes. And yet the legacy advantage not only makes for an ethical embarrassment in Agassiz House; it also affects the everyday interactions of students on campus, from dining hall dinners to Friday night festivities. By removing the legacy policy now, Harvard can change its institutional culture in hugely important ways.
As it currently stands, Harvard projects a message of exclusivity. We’ve come a long way since quotas and no financial aid. But in giving legacy applicants an advantage, Harvard does not merely acknowledge injustice as part of the world—it endorses it. The College effectively says that, given two otherwise equal applicants, it will take the child of privilege because Harvard values privilege. This is unconscionable. And it is unwise to think that such a message does not present tangible effects in students’ daily lives.
It is enough that a vast and visible contingent of Harvard students arrive on campus seemingly with the key to success already in the pockets of their dark-wash jeans. It is enough that these students gain access to social spaces unavailable to many of their peers right off the bat—the Hasty Pudding social club freshman year, final clubs the next, and whatever else comes in between. It is enough that these students can afford to comp any organization they desire without worrying about work-study jobs, or that they can say "yes" to dinner in the Square any evening without fretting over keeping sufficient funds in their bank accounts. But it is far more than enough that Harvard gives its institutional stamp of approval to wealth over worthiness and prestige over personality.
Eliminating legacy preference would not mean eliminating legacies, nor should it: These students, like all members of our community, pursue rich and varied activities on campus. But applicants who already have an edge in admissions do not need and do not deserve a handicap.
Harvard’s legacy preference is, in the simplest terms, wrong. It takes opportunities from those with less and turns them over to those who have more. It lends legitimacy to the entrenched and insidious campus tendency to give affluence an unmistakable social cachet. Removing legacy preference, surely, will not cause a sea of change at the College. Harvard will still suffer from a culture of elitism, and each Harvard student will still suffer from its implications. More pervasive tweaks to the admissions process may help with some issues of socioeconomic justice on campus. Other issues need work after admission, on the campus ground, for any change to occur.
Without legacy preference, things will not be perfect, and they may not even be close. But just because something will not be perfect does not mean we should not strive to make it better. A Harvard without legacy preference would, without question, be a better Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the ice at Ridder Arena in Minneapolis, over 1,100 miles from home, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team had the program’s first NCAA title within reach. But 60 minutes of play later, that same ice was cleared smooth once again, and the Crimson watched another team, hometown favorite Minnesota, hoist the trophy in victory.
This moment in late March is critical to understanding the 2014-2015 season, but even more noteworthy, perhaps, is the tale of a journey that landed the team in contention for the national championship.
The beginning of the season marked the return of coach Katey Stone from her time at the helm of Team USA at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Seniors Josephine Pucci and Lyndsey Fry as well as junior Michelle Picard returned with Stone, bringing with them the experience of playing in the Olympic theater. After spending a year away from Cambridge, the players were welcomed back, with Picard stepping right into one of the captain roles.
The atmosphere into which the Olympians returned was one of continued success, as interim head coach Maura Crowell led the team to an ECAC semifinal appearance and a NCAA tournament bid last season. The program handed back to Stone was one ready to improve upon the success it had already experienced the year before, yet stacked with even more talent and questions about who would start and contribute.
“[Stone and the Olympians] were a huge reason why we were so successful this season,” co-captain Samantha Reber said. “We basically had the same team we did last year minus the few seniors we graduated last year.”
The Crimson encountered some early success, going 3-0-1 over its first four games. However, a 10-2 loss to a top-ranked Boston College squad on Nov. 28 provided the team’s first taste of adversity.
“I don’t think any of us had ever lost a game by that much in our hockey careers,” Reber said. “It was kind of shocking and was a wake up call because we knew we had so much more talent than that and so much more team chemistry. I think the game was the best thing that happened to us all season in the fact that it got us back to playing Harvard hockey.”
Reber was right as the loss proved to be somewhat of a blessing in disguise for the team, as it went on to win its next 10 games, including conference victories over then-No. 4/4 Quinnipiac and Yale.
Next on the Crimson’s list of feats to tackle was the Beanpot, which Harvard hosted at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Matched up against then-No. 6/6 Boston University in the first round of the tournament, the Crimson set the tone early, scoring two goals in the first period. The Crimson then exploded in the second frame, adding another five goals en route to a 9-2 win.
The win propelled the Harvard into the championship game for the first time in four years. All that stood in the way of a Beanpot title was top-ranked Boston College, who had been unbeaten through 28 games.
“I think our kids knew that they had gotten embarrassed by BC in November,” Stone said. “We knew we had gotten better. We were stronger internally, and we were able to show it. Our kids were ready to go that night, and that night gave us a lot of confidence.”
The rematch proved to be a hard-fought battle between the two ranked programs.
The Eagles struck first in the contest, sneaking a goal past Crimson junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer within the first two minutes of the game, but junior forward Mary Parker evened the score later in the period to knot the score at a goal apiece. The Eagles crept back into the driver’s seat at the 8:18 mark of the second period, but the goal was answered a little over a minute later by freshman forward Karly Heffernan.
The deciding score came off the stick of junior forward Miye D’Oench midway through the second period. On a power play, D’Oench capitalized on a rebound in front of the BC goal to put Harvard in front for good.

When the final buzzer sounded, Harvard had not only pulled off the upset; it also had sealed its first Beanpot championship in five years and the 14th in program history. The victory was complete when, after the ice cleared, Maschmeyer took home the MVP trophy.
“It’s always rewarding getting those kind of awards,” Maschmeyer said. “But in my position, I really have to rely on my teammates to make me look good. They work hard in order for me to look good, so I have to obviously acknowledge them.”
With the Beanpot trophy in hand, the Crimson skated into its final weekend of the regular season a week later with a three-point edge in the ECAC standings.
In the penultimate game of the regular season, St. Lawrence maintained tempo with Harvard, forcing a 1-1 tie at the end of the night. Sophomore forward Sydney Daniels netted her 16th goal of the season, and Maschmeyer made 31 saves in goal, but the offensive could muster no more than that one score.
The tie placed a critical importance on the following night’s contest, as Harvard’s lead over Clarkson in the league standings had shrunk to two points. A victory or tie for the Crimson would be enough to clinch the conference crown, while a loss would force a tie atop the ECAC and give the Golden Knights the top seed in the playoffs. And in a hard-fought battle on Senior Night at the Bright, the Crimson failed to capitalize on its opportunities, falling to Clarkson, 1-0.
“The series that we had with St. Lawrence and Clarkson at the beginning of the year where we only got one point out of the weekend kind of happened again this series, and it made us kind of get our hunger back,” Stone said. “Sometimes you need a little kick in the pants to make sure you’re focused and prepared and on your toes.”
The loss proved to be just what the team needed as Harvard steamrolled to its sixth ECAC tournament title the following weekend after beating Yale, Quinnipiac, and Cornell en route to the trophy.
While the team celebrated its championship win, news of its seeding in the NCAA tournament came through. The Crimson earned the third seed and a date with Quinnipiac in the first round of the tournament, setting up the fourth matchup of the season between the two teams.
Just as it had done three times before, Harvard defeated the Bobcats, this time by a score of 5-0, bringing the Crimson one step closer to the ultimate goal of a national championship. But the win pitted Harvard against a familiar foe—Boston College.
In the rubber match against its crosstown rival, the Crimson came out victorious once again behind 43 saves from Maschmeyer. A 2-1 win over the Eagles landed the team in the NCAA championship game for the first time in 10 years.
In 2005, the Crimson faced Minnesota in the title game, and history would repeat itself a decade later. Held on the Golden Gophers’ home ice at Ridder, the national championship game drew a sellout crowd.
“The atmosphere in the building was unlike anything I had ever played in before,” Reber said. “It was pretty insane…. We almost sold out the rink for both games. I would go to a faceoff and try to tell my linemates what we were going to do, and they could not hear me because it was so loud.”
Harvard kept close with the hosts for the entire game. After going down 1-0 early on, the Crimson offense could not convert until the third period when Minnesota already had a two-goal lead. The Golden Gophers answered Harvard’s scoring conversion with one of their own, widening the gap to 3-1. An empty net goal at the 18:12 mark of the third period then sealed the national championship for Minnesota.
Despite the fact that Harvard was unable to bring the NCAA trophy back to Cambridge, Stone recognizes that the season will go down as one to remember for the program.
“I thought we had a great season,” Stone said. “We had great leadership, great execution, and had a ton of fun along the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For opposing coaches trying to figure out how to slow down the Harvard men’s ice hockey team this past season, the first step in shutting down the offense was clear: contain junior forward Jimmy Vesey.
Doing so was much easier said than done.
Despite being the primary target of every defense he faced, Vesey continued to make gains for his team, propelling himself into the national spotlight. The junior notched 32 goals to top all Division I scorers, leading him to a stage inside Northeastern’s Matthews Arena as a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award at season’s end.
“I’m somewhat reluctant to rank players numerically,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But I will say with certainty that he deserves to be mentioned among the names of the great Harvard hockey players. To lead the country in goals this year was an amazing contribution [and] to be a Hobey Baker finalist...and doing so while receiving a lot of extra attention from opponents…[was] incredible.”
The former Ivy League Rookie of the Year was at the forefront of the team’s renewed success this winter. After the Nashville Predators prospect emerged as the Crimson’s top offensive threat with 22 points a season ago, he solidified his status as one of the nation’s most dangerous attacking forwards this year, registering 58 points on the season.
“Our commitment level really started to change last year at the end of the season,” Donato said. “He’s really worked to become an all-around player.”
The Charlestown native opened the season with a 20-game point streak, leading his team to a 10-1-2 start in 2014. But after the Crimson limped to the finish by winning only three of its last 11 regular season games, the team found itself in a position where it had to advance far in the ECAC playoffs to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament.
The Crimson needed its top scorer to step up, and he did just that. The star forward recorded 14 points in seven games during the conference tournament, including two goals in both the semifinals and finals to help bring the Whitelaw Cup back to Cambridge.
“Jimmy had an incredible season...delivering down the stretch in the biggest of moments,” Donato said.
Perhaps no moment summed up Vesey’s role as a clutch scorer more so than his performance in double overtime of Harvard’s rubber match with Yale in the ECAC tournament quarterfinals. Up against a side that had been unbeaten against the Crimson in its last 10 tries entering the series, Vesey corralled a puck just above the crease and lifted it over the extended right pad of Bulldog goaltender Alex Lyon, sending the squad to the semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y.
Although Boston University freshman forward Jack Eichel took home the Hobey Baker Award, Vesey still managed to come away with some hardware of his own. The forward was named the ECAC Player of the Year and the recipient of the Walter Brown Award, given to the top American-born men’s ice hockey player competing in New England, beating out fellow Massachusetts native Eichel.
While Vesey caught the attention of hockey fans across the country, there was, perhaps, no one more interested in Vesey’s season than Nashville Predators general manager David Poile. The Northeastern graduate was widely documented keeping tabs on the junior’s season, waiting for the chance to call him up to the professional level at the end of Harvard’s season to possibly aid Nashville’s Stanley Cup playoff push.
Vesey took a few days to deliberate whether or not to forgo his senior season once the team bowed out at the hands of Nebraska-Omaha in the NCAA regional semifinals before ultimately deciding to stay at school.
“First and foremost, I think he did an incredible job of keeping his focus and attention on our season and finishing strong,” Donato said. “He’s not only a great player but a very intelligent kid…. We’re very excited about his decision.”
Vesey’s time on the ice this year did not come to an end after the loss to Nebraska-Omaha. The junior recently wrapped up his stint with Team USA at the IIHF Men’s World Championship overseas, where the Americans beat out the Czech Republic to bring home bronze.
“It’s cool to skate with a guy all year and then see him play at that level of competition,” fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally said. “Especially with the way he’s been playing because he’s been playing well. It’s great to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With five seconds to go and his team down two at Brown on Feb. 6, Harvard senior wing Wesley Saunders spun into the lane and hoisted a running floater—but missed the mark. As the ball began to fall, it seemed that the Crimson’s chances at a fifth consecutive Ivy League championship were hopelessly dwindling.
Harvard had already lost two weeks prior at home to Dartmouth on Jan. 24—losing to the Bears would mean trouble for coach Tommy Amaker’s squad. Nonetheless, Saunders grabbed his own rebound and laid the ball back in for the tie, sending the game into overtime and towards an eventual Harvard win.
Saunders dropped a career-high 33 points on that February night to go along with 10 rebounds, three steals, and three assists. While it may have been a career high in points for the senior, Saunders continued to stuff the stat sheet with similar performances throughout his final collegiate campaign.
“Wesley does a lot for us,” said Amaker after a win at Princeton on Jan. 30. “[It’s] not so much the points he scores, it’s the points he’s responsible for.”
This season, Saunders averaged 16.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.8 steals per game and was a unanimous All-Ivy League first team selection.
But Saunders’s dominance this season was not limited to Ivy League play. In what was arguably Harvard’s biggest game of the season, Saunders stupefied North Carolina’s defense in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Despite the Crimson loss, Saunders scored his team’s first 10 points on his way to a 26-point performance that would leave his team two points short of an upset.
“Well, we thought we had a strategy for him, but it didn’t work,” said UNC coach Roy Williams after the game. “[Small forward J.P. Tokoto] really did a pretty doggone good job, but he was really, really hard to guard.”
While many were taken aback by the dominance of a mid-major player like Saunders against a powerhouse like the Tar Heels, those who regularly make the trip to Lavietes Pavilion were less than surprised. This year, Saunders was named a finalist for the Lou Henson award, given to the top mid-major player in Division I basketball and was ranked 46th in
ESPN’s countdown of the top-100 players in college basketball in October.
“We run everything through Wesley,” said Amaker following a win against Dartmouth on Jan. 10. “He is our best perimeter defender, he is our best playmaker, [and] he is Mr. Do-Everything for our team.”
Saunders tends to slowly and methodically break down a defense, yet can show bursts of speed cutting to the basket and flying through the air. Adding to that versatility was the development of the deep ball this season from Saunders. This year, Saunders took over twice as many shots from beyond the arc as he did a year ago, yet managed to shoot 42.5 percent from downtown, up from 29.4 percent his junior season.
Saunders finished his collegiate career ranked fourth in Harvard history for both points (1,511) and steals (175), and his basketball journey is far from over as some consider him to be a fringe NBA draft prospect this year.
Despite criticisms over how Saunders’s game will translate at the professional level, his length on the perimeter and improved shooting from the field could very well land him on an NBA roster next fall. If drafted, Saunders would be the first Ancient Eight player chosen since Penn’s current head coach, Jerome Allen, was selected in 1995.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Entering his 22nd season as Harvard football’s head coach, Tim Murphy has already recruited hundreds of players.
There are 160-pound kickers and 260-pound linebackers. There are men from California and Florida, from the Northeast and the Midwest.
After football, they will spread out even further. Some, such as alumni Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and Matt Birk ’98, will go the distance to the NFL. Others will become investment bankers, doctors, lawyers, or coaches.
The differences are immense, but every member of Murphy’s army shares at least one shimmering similarity: a championship ring.
Yes, every four-year athlete Murphy has recruited has won an Ancient Eight title.
While team success may seem as consistent as a Cambridge winter, Murphy reached new heights in 2014.
He had beaten Yale 15 times heading into this past fall, coached three undefeated teams, but with a 31-24 triumph in this year’s edition of The Game, Murphy claimed his third conference title in four years. No other Crimson team had accomplished this feat since the Ivy League formed in 1954.
From his first interview to the latest water-cooler shower, Murphy has preached a gospel that elevates constancy of character and embraces misfortune.
“We love adverse situations,” said junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer. “We love high-stakes situations…. That’s something that’s kind of the team motto.”
This central focus proved vital for the 2014 campaign as Harvard battled through injuries among the slew of starters, ranging from senior quarterback Conner Hempel to senior running back Andrew Casten.
Led by Murphy’s “next guy up” philosophy, the Crimson demonstrated how prescient preparation could overcome lousy luck. Junior quarterback Scott Hosch replaced Hempel, freshman rusher Semar Smith replaced Casten, and Harvard rolled through, setting the stage for a decisive matchup against Yale in late November.
“We train all year round for adversity,” Hempel said. “Adversity in the game of football is happening all the time…. [Murphy] does a great job running the program.”
Then there was The Game itself, crowned with unprecedented media attention (ESPN’s College GameDay) along with the usual roaring of 30,000 fans at Harvard Stadium.
On the defensive side, Harvard was able to hold Bulldog running back Tyler Varga to a season-low 4.2 yards per carry and Yale to a season-low 24 points. On offense, Murphy coordinated the clinching drive that ended with a slant-and-go call for Fischer for a 35-yard touchdown.
“It was truly amazing to see the culmination of a perfect season at home before a sold-out crowd on national television,” wrote Murphy in a Nov. 25 open letter published in The Crimson. “It does not get sweeter than capping a 10-0 season at home, while our campus was the center of the college football universe last weekend.”
Harvard certainly did not occupy this exalted position when Murphy arrived on campus in 1994. In the preceding two seasons, Harvard had gone a combined 6-14 with just four Ancient Eight victories.
But four seasons of Murphy later, members of the Crimson sprinted around the chilly basin of the Yale Bowl, celebrating the squad’s first Ivy League championship since 1987.
This was not Murphy’s first triumph as a coach as he claimed a share of the league title his first year at Maine and turned a one-win team around in Cincinnati.
Yet nothing can match the extended success that Murphy has brought the Crimson.
He has accrued more wins than any other Harvard coach, winning seven Ancient Eight championships in the last 14 years and 13 of the last 14 Harvard-Yale match-ups.
More, he has achieved all these feats with a poker-like sense of composure.
“He’s always focused,” senior linebacker Connor Sheehan said. “He’s got a business-like mentality…. We know what kind of discipline it takes to be successful, and we emulate that throughout the week in practice.”
From blowout wins over Princeton and Columbia to late teeth-grinders against Dartmouth and Penn, this season gave Murphy plenty of reasons to break his cool and collected character mold. But players insist that Murphy—this maestro in the middle of the mayhem—hardly wavered.
Well, at least until the last minute of The Game. By any measure possible, that was something special.
“That last touchdown [at Harvard-Yale] was probably the most excited I’ve seen him,” Fischer said. “As hard as he tried to contain it, it definitely came through.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colin Blackwell did not see his shot go in. A hip check from Colgate junior Kyle Baun had left the Harvard forward sprawling along the rink boards right after releasing the puck at the red line of Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y., at the ECAC title game on March 21.
When he heard the roar of his teammates, he lost all sense of time and space.
“To be honest, I just kind of blacked out,” laughed Blackwell as he reflected on the empty-netter, which was the final score of the Crimson’s 4-2 championship victory. “Just kind of did my thing.”
Blackwell jumped onto the rink’s unusually short glass, completing a single pull-up before celebrating with his teammates. The unorthodox celebration will go down as one of the most enduring images of this year’s Harvard men’s ice hockey season—not only for the title it heralded but also for the individual comeback it represented.
“I just think it was fitting that it was Colin,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “To come back after all he’s been through and to seal the game with that goal—I think was a fitting tribute to a guy that really persevered and endured an incredible amount of health challenges along the way.”
During the 2012-2013 season, Blackwell sustained two major concussions within a span of four months. The second one proved devastating.
The North Andover, Mass., native missed all of the 2013-2014 season and decided to withdraw from school in the spring to heal. It seemed that no treatment could ease Blackwell’s symptoms.
“The most frustrating part is, everything I kept doing, nothing was really kind of helping it out,” Blackwell said. “When other kids on my team or other athletes were getting concussions, they were slowly getting better and back into it. And for me it was like, ‘What’s wrong with me?’”
Blackwell began to feel better in the spring of 2014 and was cleared for contact in the summer. In the fall, he arrived on campus ready to play before a third concussion took him off the ice. A quick rehabilitation period allowed him to return for a nonconference contest against Bentley on Nov. 21, yet Blackwell felt dizzy and lightheaded during the game.
“I don’t think that I played that poorly, but I was very hesitant,” Blackwell said. “I wasn’t really looking to get hit, and after the game, everything came back, symptoms-wise.”
He realized he needed more time. When he resumed full-contact practices during the last week of the regular season, he was physically prepared, but he still had to confront the fear of a future injury.
“At that point I was sort of fighting a psychological battle,” Blackwell said. “I finally looked at myself in the mirror and said, ‘You’re ready. You’re going to have to get over the fears. You’re eventually going to have to do it sometime.’”
By the start of Harvard’s first-round ECAC playoff series with Brown on March 6, Blackwell felt like his old self.
After his return in the final weekend of the regular season, there was a sense that he could make a difference for a talented team that had struggled over the previous two months with midseason injuries.
In Game 1, Blackwell left no doubt. He scored his first two goals since January 2013, drew two penalties, and brought an intense pace to his shifts. The next night, he potted a third to help secure the series sweep.
“I don’t really know anyone else who would just take two years off like that and then step right in like that,” said fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally, who recovered from a debilitating knee injury to make his own comeback in the ECAC tournament quarterfinals at Yale.
In the final period of regulation in New Haven, Blackwell connected with McNally on a drop-pass for a season-saving score that forced overtime. After the Crimson advanced on junior forward Jimmy Vesey’s double overtime winner, Blackwell continued his run in Lake Placid, scoring in both the semifinal and final. He would finish the tournament with five goals in seven games—second on the team only to Vesey’s tournament-record nine.
“You would think that there would be a lot of rust or that he wouldn’t be the same,” McNally said. “He didn’t lose a step—if anything, he gained one.”
McNally was the first to wrap his arms around Blackwell following the pull-up. Above all the congratulations exchanged in the celebratory huddle around the goal-scorer, Blackwell remembers three simple words: “We did it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a Sunday in the middle of the spring semester finals period, and Harvard senior Amanda Sobhy is competing at the World Squash Doubles Championships.
Calling in from Chicago, Sobhy says that she is finding time to study but that it is difficult to provide full attention to reading notes when you are just an hour away from an international title in mixed doubles.
At least her teachers have been flexible. The top-ranked women’s player from the United States was scheduled to take an exam the previous Thursday, but her professor decided to grant her some leeway.
Thus, when Sobhy returned from Illinois clutching a second-place finish along with a carry-on bag, she had to face one last opponent: finals.
“When I need to study, I’ll take time to study,” Sobhy said. “Then when I go to training, I’ll put the full effort into training. That way I don’t waste any time.”
If the life of Amanda Sobhy appears to be hectic, that is because it is. For the past four years, Sobhy has shouldered a heavy load of personal responsibilities, from professional tournaments and collegiate competition to a Harvard course load.
But with a packed schedule has come impressive results. Over her four years with the Harvard team, Sobhy has never lost a match. In fact, she has dropped only two games while competing for the Crimson—both to Trinity’s Kanzy El-Defrawy—but she won both of those matches in four games.
During this run, Sobhy has claimed four consecutive Ramsay Cups as the women’s individual national collegiate champion. Only Gail Ramsay, the award’s namesake and current coach of the Princeton women’s team, has also accomplished this feat.
“Amanda’s definitely very competitive,” co-captain Haley Mendez said. “She commits herself to everything she does, especially if it’s a competition, and will go above and beyond to help her team and to win.”
All this collegiate success has paved the way for Sobhy’s post-graduation plans, as she will play squash full-time after Harvard.
For Sobhy, however, the idea of going pro is more of a formality than a significant milestone. Already ranked No. 10 in the world and No. 1 in the United States, Sobhy has multiple professional tournaments titles to her name, including one at the Women’s Texas Open in April.
But over the years, while Sobhy has continued to rise in the national rankings, one thing has remained the same. At each step of her career, Sobhy’s father Khaled has cheered on his daughter. In fact, he served as Sobhy’s first coach and taught her how to handle a racket.
A squash player himself, Khaled Sobhy met his wife, Jodie Larson, on a court in New York City. Their marriage produced three college squash athletes: Amanda’s older brother Omar, her younger sister Sabrina, and Amanda herself.
“We all push each other,” Amanda said. “[Some people] have to travel an hour to go get some matches…. We go from home to the courts, and we’re there playing.”
Amanda developed an interest in the sport after watching her father train with Omar. Early in her career, the opportunity to beat her older brother pushed the middle Sobhy sibling through tough training sessions.
These days, the more significant rivalry within the Sobhy family is the one between Amanda and Sabrina, the latter of whom is currently ranked fourth in the nation. In fact, a recent Boston Globe profile called the duo the “Venus and Serena Williams” of the squash world.
In the finals of the 2014 U.S. Squash Championships, Amanda matched up against Sabrina for the American crown. Youth triumphed over experience, as Sabrina took the match in three games.
It was an internal struggle for Amanda: the uneasy balance between familial pride and personal disappointment. But the elder sister handled the defeat as she handles many setbacks, namely by turning them into motivational anecdotes.
“I’m glad if anyone had to beat me and win the national title, it was my sister,” Amanda said. “But I obviously wasn’t happy to lose. [Sabrina’s] nipping at me from behind, so that motivates me to train harder.”
This past March, Amanda returned to that same tournament and claimed the U.S. national title without dropping a game.
The dominant performance was reminiscent of the ones Sobhy has been putting on since the start of her Harvard career. Sobhy has held the Crimson’s top position since midway through her freshman season, a campaign in which she recorded a perfect 15-0 individual record. In that year, Harvard began the season as the top-ranked team in the nation and finished as the unbeaten national champion.
Following up such an unblemished campaign is no easy task, and Sobhy admits to having battled feelings of pressure throughout her college career. At times, it was no longer enough to win every match—she also had to claim every game.
“I can’t imagine the pressure to be honest,” Mendez said. “Going into every match, the team expects her to win. We go in thinking we’re already up one-love.”
Although Sobhy finally dropped her first game midway through her sophomore year, the small disappointment had no effect on her progress, as she still finished the season, and eventually her collegiate career, with a perfect record.
“There’s a ton of pressure on me to live up to the expectations of everyone,” Sobhy said. “I was just happy the way that I dealt with all that pressure. To actually win the four titles was a little [relieving].”
Sobhy will face greater challenges in her post-collegiate career, which she will base out of Boston. Under a new coach, former No. 1 men’s player Thierry Lincou, Sobhy will train twice a day, six days a week and zip around the world for one or two tournaments each month.
It’s a hectic schedule, but the Sea Cliff, N.Y., native has heard that before.
“I think she can only go up from here once she starts focusing on her professional career full-time,” Mendez said. “But I think her results speak for themselves already. She’s top-10 in the world while going to Harvard. It’s an incredible accomplishment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following graduation, Harvard students disperse into the world on a diverse range of paths. Many pursue full-time employment. Some immediately enroll in graduate school. Others travel abroad. However, a select few follow their dreams of becoming professional athletes.
For these athletes, the road traditionally less traveled means continuing a familiar routine of road trips, rigorous training regimens, and endless competition, all in pursuit of lifelong goals.
GOOD MORNING, BALTIMORE
Of the four major sports leagues, the National Football League has seen the most Harvard alumni join, with 41 players having made it to the professional league since 1920. Boldface success stories include Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, the first Harvard graduate to start at quarterback in the NFL, and Matt Birk ’98, a former All-Pro center and Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl champion who currently works as the league’s Director of Football Development. Senior defensive end Zack Hodges made recent headlines for signing with the Indianapolis Colts in May.
Graduating senior offensive lineman Nick Easton, a recent free agent signee with the Ravens, will hope to follow the success of his Harvard predecessors. And he’ll get a chance to do it alongside fullback Kyle Juszczyk ’13, who has appeared in every game for the Ravens since arriving in Baltimore. Juszczyk and Easton were teammates on the 2010 and 2011 Harvard teams that went a combined 16-4 overall and 12-2 in Ivy League play.
For Easton, the love for football started at a young age—from the time he began playing, he dreamt about being able to play in the NFL.
The Lenoir, N.C., native made his Harvard debut on the field during his sophomore year, appearing in four games in 2011. After taking the 2012 season off, things picked up for Easton in his junior campaign. He played in all 10 games and earned spots on both the All-Ivy League first team and the FCS All-New England team.
What began as a dream became a distinct possibility in Easton’s senior season, when he began attracting the attention of professional teams. He started every game for the Crimson, was named to All-America and All-Ivy teams, and was invited to play in the NFL Players Association Collegiate Bowl. In early May, all of his efforts paid off when he signed an undrafted free agent contract with the Ravens.
Fortunately for Easton, he will not be the lone Harvard graduate at training camp.
“I’m really excited to join Kyle,” Easton said. “It’s always nice to have a familiar face when you are going into a new and unfamiliar situation.”
After seeing immediate action in all 10 games as a freshman for the Crimson, Juszczyk was an honorable mention All-Ivy selection as a sophomore. That spring, Juszczyzk realized his NFL dreams could become a reality; the following fall, his performance earned him second-team All-American honors from multiple outlets.
“[Murphy said] that if I just continued to grow and excel in the program, by the time I graduated, playing in the NFL was actually possible,” Juszczyk said. “Just hearing that from him definitely motivated me and made me start to realize this could actually happen.”
Juszczyk finished his college career as a three-time All-Ivy selection, a two-time All-American, and the program’s all-time leader in catches, yards, and touchdowns for a tight end. After playing in the Senior Bowl, Juszczyk was selected by the Ravens in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. It was the highest a Harvard player had been selected in the draft since Isaiah Kacyvenski ’00 was picked 119th in 2000.
But despite making a name for himself as one of the primary weapons in the Crimson’s offensive attack, after hearing his name called at the draft, Juszczyk had to adjust to a new position.
“In my whole recruiting process for the NFL, very few teams saw me as a tight end,” Juszczyk said. “Everyone basically assumed that I would be a fullback, based basically on my height. Fullback was the more natural position for me…. Football is football, and if you love it, you’ll adapt.”
Following organized team activities and training camp, Juszczyk made the Ravens roster as a rookie and saw limited action on special teams. At the end of the season, he returned to campus to finish his academic career and get his degree.
“I knew even after having a job in the NFL that it would be important to have that degree because the NFL is a very short career,” Juszczyk said. “I’m going to need my degree one day because football’s not going to last forever.”
After the Ravens released starting running back Ray Rice, Juszczyk received an expanded role in the offense in 2014. He started 14 games, recording 19 catches for 119 yards with one touchdown grab, the first for a Harvard player since 1980. Juszczyk made six more catches over two postseason contests.
“The biggest key from year one to year two is really comfortability—just being comfortable with the system and being in a new city,” Juszczyk said. “I always relate it to college. Freshman year, everything seems like it’s going so fast—you’ve got new classes, you’re in a new city, you get new friends. It’s really the same thing when you get to the NFL.”
KILLORN IT ON THE ICE
Roughly three years ago, Alex Killorn ’12 had just wrapped up his collegiate hockey career, was about to graduate from Harvard, and found himself on the verge of winning a Calder Cup with the American Hockey League’s Norfolk Admirals. Now, Killorn, Harvard degree in tow, skates on a line with Maurice Richard Trophy winner Steven Stamkos, playing a key role on a Tampa Bay Lightning team with Stanley Cup aspirations.
“I’m really happy with the way things have gone,” Killorn said. “I’m pretty blessed, especially playing on a top line in the [National Hockey League], playing with a guy like Steven Stamkos, a guy I remember when I was in college…. I used to watch [him] play on TV, never really thinking that I would play with him.”
Killorn’s road to the NHL was a winding one. After growing up in Beaconsfield, Quebec, Killorn attended high school in Montreal before playing a season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League at age 16. The forward attended Deerfield Academy in Western Massachusetts for two years and was drafted by the Lightning in the 2007 NHL Draft after his junior year. But rather than heading straight to the professional ranks, Killorn opted to attend Harvard and made an immediate impact on the program.
“At Harvard, one of the things I learned was really to focus on what you’re doing,” Killorn said. “It’s tough because you have to write a paper, and then you have to go back [to it] after practice. It was tough to juggle all that when you knew in your heart you wanted to be a hockey player.”
Following his junior season in Cambridge, in which he had 29 points in 34 games, Killorn received a contract offer from the Lightning. But Killorn decided to stay put, eventually leading Harvard to the championship game of the ECAC tournament. Killorn finished his career with over 50 goals and more than 100 points, raising the bar in each of his four seasons.
“One of the reasons I picked Harvard was because I wanted to graduate from there and have that degree,” Killorn said. “I’ve been pretty fortunate that [the] best of both worlds worked out for me. I got my degree and with my development, I think I needed those four years to kind of really become the player I am.”
Killorn split his 2012-2013 campaign between the Lightning and the AHL’s Syracuse Crunch before becoming a fixture on last year’s Lightning team that fell to the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Over his two full regular seasons in the NHL, Killorn has registered 32 goals and 47 assists. He has also provided a spark to the Lightning offense this postseason, recording 15 points through the first 17 games of the playoffs.
“I know my first two years I played good hockey—it’s just about being more consistent as a player,” Killorn said. “I think this year I’ve had more ice time, and the coaches have more confidence in me. The more consistent play led to more ice time, [and] I think I’ve used that to my advantage.”
SOMETHING BREWING
Brent Suter ’12 remembers sitting in his government class as a senior at Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati, emailing a video of himself pitching to the Harvard baseball coaching staff.
In response, the Crimson sent a scout to one of Suter’s fall tournaments; a few weeks later, Suter was in Cambridge for his official visit—one that ultimately led him to commit to the Crimson later that year.
“I was just really lucky that everything fell into place for that. It was one of [my] goals to get into a good school and being able to play baseball there,” Suter said. “Harvard was just a dream combination of both.”
Six and a half years after sending that fateful e-mail, the 6’5” lefty now now pitches for the Milwaukee Brewers’ Double-A affiliate, the Biloxi Shuckers of the Southern League, after being drafted in the 31st round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft.
Suter led the Crimson in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average as a freshman, was named first team All-Ivy as a sophomore, and finished among the top pitchers in the Ivy League and New England during his junior and senior campaigns.
Suter also made waves during his college offseasons, playing in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League—where he was named Pitcher of the Year in 2010—and the Cape Cod League. He was also a nominee for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award in 2012, which is given to senior athletes who excel on the field, in the classroom, and in the community.
“It wasn’t until my sophomore summer where I was pitching pretty well, where some scouts were talking to me and some agents were approaching me where I really felt like this was going to be a possibility,” Suter said. “I had some good workouts in front of teams, and then everything just kind of fell into place with the draft, so I got really lucky to get picked up.”
Following his graduation and the draft, Suter reported to the Brewers’ Rookie League affiliate in Helena, Mont. After 11 appearances, he was promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers for the remainder of the team’s 2012 campaign, and a year later, he was called up to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League, with whom he went 7-9 with a 3.63 ERA over 21 appearances.
Suter continued to perform well following a promotion to the Double-A Huntsville Stars last season against much stronger hitting opponents. He made 27 starts for the Stars, going 10-10 with a 3.96 ERA. Last April, he threw a one-hit shutout against the Mobile BayBears.
“The biggest adjustment has just been the timing of things,” Suter said. “You have a lot more free time in minor league baseball as opposed to college baseball, so you’re able to focus more on the baseball side of things. There’s a lot more time you’re able to focus on baseball.”
This season, Suter is playing for the Shuckers, which came to exist following the Stars’ move to Biloxi, Miss. In his seven appearances through May 22, Suter is 3-1 with a 2.20 ERA.
“It’s been great,” Suter said. “I love the hot and humid weather down here. The stadiums and hotels we stay in are super nice down here. My teammates have just been awesome…. The Southern League has been great, no complaints at all.”
Suter has already pitched in 72 games and accumulated over 360 innings since graduating from Harvard and continues to take it all in, one game at a time.
“That’s how you get better for this next pitch, this next game, [and] how you get to know your teammates better,” Suter said. “There’s a lot learned from Harvard, [and] I’m really grateful for my time there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First it was a school-record 15.33 meter throw, then a 16.09 mark, followed by a 16.39 meter and Ancient Eight record-setting follow-up. Then it became a weekly series of record-breaking revisions—16.51, 17.12, 17.22, and, most recently, 17.32.
This is the trajectory that the season of Harvard women’s track and field sophomore Nikki Okwelogu has taken. The Fresno, Calif., native, who competes in both shot put and discus for the Crimson, dazzled after getting a summer of international experience on the Nigerian national team.
“It’s been tremendous,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “She’s been really consistent with her improvement, and it’s a testament to what sort of competitor she is.”
Okwelogu has dominated the Ivy League this season, taking home two conference titles and earning first-team Indoor All-American honors in the shot put. The sophomore also claimed another Ancient Eight crown in the discus and two Heps Field Athlete of the Meet awards.
With just outdoor nationals and the Oxford-Cambridge meet remaining, Okwelogu is currently ranked ninth in the nation—and first among sophomores—in the shot put. Still, competing at a high level is nothing new for Okwelogu, who arrived at Harvard as a high-level recruit in both of her events with plenty of experience on the national stage.
The sophomore’s preparation for what has become a breakout season came largely from experience gained this summer competing for the Nigerian world team. Okwelogu took home the title in the shot put and finished second in the discus at the Nigerian National Championships before going on to compete at the IAAF World Junior Championships, where she qualified for the final round against a field filled with Olympic prospects.
The sophomore also had competed at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland over the summer, placing ninth in a field that included two-time Olympic champion Valerie Adams of New Zealand.
Okwelogu’s experiences over the summer have helped her come back with a more confident attitude towards the way she approaches her Ivy League and collegiate experience.
“When I walk in, I say, ‘I own this place,’” Okwelogu said earlier this month. “I have to act like I own this place, and I have to show everyone that I own this place. It’s a different mentality.”
BEHIND THE SCENES
Okwelogu’s season has not been without setbacks. She suffered an injury prior to NCAA Nationals in March but persevered to set what was at that point an Ivy record with a 17.22 meter throw, garnering her All-American honors.
These achievements have come as a result of a measured training regimen Okwelogu has cultivated over the past two years.
“Every day I come to practice trying to fix my technique, and it’s the little things,” Okwelogu said in February. “Last year I did everything that was asked of me more or less, but this year I’ve held myself more accountable by doing core on the side or eating better, showing up to practice 30 minutes early, and getting a good warmup in.”
Okwelogu’s connection with throwing coach Ross Richardson, who joined the Harvard staff in November, has also aided her performance.
“He’s done an outstanding job helping guide her, physically in training, technically with the technique work he’s done, and also the emotional aspect of our sport.” Saretsky said. “It’s been fun to see those two really clicking.”
This season, Richardson has helped Okwelogu progress from the foundation she set her freshman year. The refinement of her technical skills and the building of confidence have been major areas of improvement. Richardson says that Okwelogu’s work ethic and commitment to bettering herself as an athlete have been the main factors behind her growth.
“When she’s at practice and concentrating on her event, it’s all business,” Richardson said. “She’s really good in practice scenarios, really dialing in on what we’re trying to accomplish…. When we’re working on a concept or idea around technique, she’s just really dialed in on that.”
Along with her work ethic and talent comes a maturity which, according to Richardson, is uncommon for amateur athletes of her age.
“[Her ability] is something a mature athlete and a lot of people have to learn to do,” Richardson said. “If something goes wrong, it doesn’t throw you completely out of your mindset in competition.”
FUTURE FORTUNES
Despite all of Okwelogu’s success, Richardson believes the sophomore has yet to reach her ceiling.
“There’s a lot of room for growth,” Richardson said. “We constantly talk about improving our bottom number…what she can throw any day, any situation…[and] then it’s up to her to step up in the moment.”
Okwelogu now has her eyes set on reaching the NCAA Outdoor National Championships this June in Eugene, Oreg. While it is unclear what lies ahead for the sophomore after that, a pursuit of further international endeavors, including the Olympics, remains within the realm of possibility.
One thing is certain, however: So long as the sophomore continues to put in the hard work that she has so far, no stage will be too big for the thrower. Because now she “owns the place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a lackluster season in 2014, the Harvard baseball team finished its 2015 campaign with the most wins it has had since 2007. The Crimson was led by an offense that hit .322 and averaged nearly six runs a game in Ivy League play.
The potent attack was led by co-captain Ethan Ferreira, Harvard’s starting catcher, cleanup hitter, and leader in virtually every offensive category. However, the catcher’s work ethic and leadership played just as big of a role in the team’s improved record as his work at the plate.
“He’s an extremely hard worker, and he put a lot of time and effort into his physical fitness and into his baseball skills, both on and off the field,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “That’s really what you want in a friend and a teammate, someone who leads by example, someone who works hard. Over the last four years, he’s built that up to have this really great senior year.”
Ferreira was the only member of the Crimson to appear in all 42 games, leading the team in hits, doubles, triples, home runs, runs batted in, batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage, while tying for the team lead in walks and runs.
The catcher had been poised to become Harvard’s starter behind the dish after appearing in 35 games during his freshman season, when his older brother Andrew was one of the team’s captains. But Ethan struggled to produce, missing much of his sophomore year with an injury and hitting just .238 with eight extra-base hits as a junior.
“After the first few weekends this year, my brother took me aside and relayed the approach that pro hitters use,” Ferreira said. “It really helped me out [and] helped me stay to the middle of the field. A lot of my hits this year were to the right side and up the middle. I think the past few years, I was really pull-heavy, and when you restrict yourself to one side of the field, it’s tough to do.”
Ferreira elevated his play once Harvard returned home for Ivy League play this season. In the team’s 20 conference games, he batted .380 and drove in 20 runs. Ferreira had at least one hit in 17 of those 20 contests. Additionally, the senior compiled a 21-game hitting streak over the course of the year.
“It was pretty consistent that Ethan, both before and after [our first day of conference play], was going to be really happy to be there,” sophomore catcher Josh Ellis said. “I learned a lot from sitting on the sideline and watching him. You felt his presence whether he was talking or not.”
While the numbers speak for themselves, few expected Ferreira to make the huge jump on the field that he did. In his final season, he raised his batting average by .123 points, drove in 19 more runs, doubled his walk total, recorded 25 more hits, scored 18 more runs, and even stole four bases.
Beyond the numbers, Ferreira also followed in his brother’s footsteps, serving as a co-captain this season with outfielder Jack Colton.
“Having 32 men in a locker room look up to you as one of the two leaders is something that I’m very honored to attain,” Ferreira said. “I was captain in high school of my baseball and football teams. That’s definitely shaped my work ethic because I wanted to prove that I’m a leader, and overall, I’m just very honored.”

Now in his 11th season of coaching the Harvard women’s golf team and his third season with the men’s team, Kevin Rhoads has accomplished far more with both programs than his predecessors.
“It’s been a great experience playing under Kevin,” men’s captain Akash Mirchandani said. “He is one of the most technically knowledgeable coaches out there, and whenever anyone has a problem we can always go to him, and he’ll be able to figure out what the issue is and come up with a solution.”
Rhoads is a 1995 graduate of UCLA who played both in college and professionally. He was also a teaching professional before joining the Harvard athletics department.
“Every tournament and practice we would ask Coach Rhoads about the technical aspects and he is able to fix what we’ve done wrong while we’re on the course,” sophomore Anne Cheng said. “He is very inspiring and helps us stay focused on what we need to work on and makes sure our mental game is in the right place.”
Rhoads led the men’s team to a third-place finish at the Ivy League Championships, three additional top-three tournament finishes, one of which included a title at the Quechee Club Invitational, and a dual meet win against Ancient Eight rival Yale this season. Sophomore Robert Deng placed third individually at the league tournament.
Rhoads also notched yet another championship title in the Ivy League for the women’s side, the fourth consecutive win for the Crimson. Although last year’s victory margin was a comfortable 21 points, this season Harvard won the title by only one stroke.
“To come out with a victory is from a lot of really focused hard work over a long period of time to get to where it might just be a one-stroke difference, and I’m very proud of them for it,” Rhoads said.
The NCAA Regionals tournament saw the women’s team come just a few shots from qualifying for the national championship tournament. However, Rhoads is confident that the four Ivy titles is not the peak of Harvard golf.
“We have a pretty strong core even after the seniors graduate,” Rhoads said. “Hopefully another group will step up and fall right in line to take cues from [the seniors] who have had such strong experiences.
Golf is played as both a fall and spring sport, with no more than five tournaments per season on each team. Although there are a small number of competitions, athletes must focus year round in order to stay competitive.
“I think most importantly he’s helped me with a day-to-day outlook of what I am going to accomplish in practice or in tournaments and what is in my control to fix,” Mirchandani said. “He’s made me realize that sometimes I do all the right things and might not get the best result and to just focus on what I can do to get better and not to get bogged down by it.”
Even after a record-snowfall in Boston resulted in a winter that severely inhibited both squads’ ability to train outdoors and tournaments in terrible weather conditions as well, Rhoads was able to focus more on what the players could control—such as their technique and the team atmosphere—when the uncontrollable factors were not working in their favor.
“It’s actually a nice feeling that I have as coach and that they have as players when I know they have a lot of faith in each other and themselves, and all they know they can do is give themselves the best chance to succeed,” Rhoads said. “I know that their focus isn’t on how tight it is, but on what they can do for this shot and to do the same for the next one and the one after that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her inaugural season on the women’s ice hockey team, freshman Lexie Laing took the team by storm. As one of the six freshmen to be added to this year’s squad, the 5’6” Marblehead, Mass., native was thrown into the mix of Olympians and experienced players early in the season and never looked back.
Despite being a fresh face on the squad, Laing, hailing from the Noble and Greenough School, was no stranger to the Harvard Hockey family when she stepped foot on campus. Nobles has a long tradition of sending women’s ice hockey players into Cambridge, with eight current players being alumni of the school, including Lexie’s sister Brianna, a sophomore goalie on the squad.
But when she arrived on the Harvard ice, Lexie was able to create her own game independent of the other players she had become familiar with. In her first game on the season, Lexie had four shots on goal and won 10-of-13 faceoffs for the Crimson. Her first goal came the game after on a power play against Rensselaer, signaling the start to a campaign that would see her go on to score 10 goals, the only freshman to have double-digit goals.
“We put Lexie into the hot seat right off the bat,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She came in and we put her into a position with a lot of responsibility because I knew she could handle it and she did. She didn’t disappoint.”
It only took those two performances on the ice for Lexie to be put on the first line. In the game against Union on Nov. 1 in her third game in a Crimson uniform, Lexie contributed two shots on goal, converted 8-of-11 faceoffs she took, and had a plus-3 rating for the contest.
Even coming onto a team that was mostly upperclassmen with years of experience playing collegiate hockey, there was room on the team for youth to make an impact.
As the season progressed, Laing was called upon to fill different roles on the team, including taking an unusually large share of the defensive responsibilities for a forward.
“She got better and better as the year went on and sometimes depending on the game her contribution was a bigger defensively than offensively but she was always up for the task,” Stone said. “There are definitely only good things to come from her.”
Making such large strides in her first season made an impact on Laing’s teammates, who credited her intensity and work ethic as a driving force behind her success.
“She’s definitely an athletic player,” senior Josephine Pucci said. “She goes hard all the time, and that’s an intangible thing you can’t really teach. She grinds out plays and she does what she can to use grit to get the puck. That’s huge…having that hard work mentality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football coach Tim Murphy is running out of fingers for his championship rings. In the program’s storied history, the squad has collected 16 titles, half of which have come during Murphy’s tenure. But this year’s ring will feel a little heavier—a little more special.
For just the second time in over a century, the Crimson ended the season with a 10-0 record. In many ways, this team was an unlikely one to accomplish the feat. The secondary was one of the youngest in the league, boasting just one senior in captain Norman Hayes. Both starting running backs, as well as multiple veteran receivers, battled injuries throughout the season. After senior Conner Hempel had a breakout season last year, the quarterback situation was thrust into uncertainty when Hempel became sidelined for much of the season with an injured back.
However, through all the adversity, this team managed to do what only one other Harvard team had done in over 100 years. The secondary came together under Hayes’s leadership to become the top passing defense in the league. Junior Scott Hosch stepped up to fill in for Hempel, producing plays that kept the Crimson’s streak alive, including a late touchdown pass in the Crimson’s penultimate game against Penn to help keep the perfect season intact.
“I think from day one it definitely seemed like a possibility, but I think the biggest thing that we did was take it one game at a time,” said junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer. “We never looked toward the 10th game, or the ninth game, or the eighth game; it was always the next day, getting better and making sure that we had the ability to go for that run.”
For this group of seniors, the feat is especially sweet. Two years ago, Harvard gave up a large lead late in the fourth quarter to break up its perfect season and lost the Ivy title three weeks later at Penn. Last season, the Crimson came even closer to the elusive 10-0, dropping just a triple-overtime match against the Tigers and taking home a share of the championship.
This year, on Princeton’s home turf, Harvard built a 35-point lead heading into the fourth quarter en route to a 49-7 beatdown. A few weeks later, in Philadelphia, Hosch and company led a late comeback to set the stage for one of the biggest Harvard-Yale games in Ivy League history. And when Hempel connected with Fischer with less than a minute left in the Game to give the Crimson the final lead, he also solidified the place of the 2014 football squad in the history books.
“I think every championship team is special and every championship team is unique,” Murphy said. “Does it make it just a tad more unique when you have a perfect season? Does it make it a tad more unique in the fashion that our kids and coaches accomplished it? Absolutely.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Don’t call it a comeback.
After being away from the program last season to coach the U.S. Olympic team in Sochi, Russia, Harvard women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone returned to the Crimson for her 20th season and continued her success as the head of the program.
The time Stone spent away from Cambridge did not dampen her ability to mold the team, as she took the to the NCAA Championship game in her first season back. Although the team dropped its final game to Minnesota, making it the national championship was a milestone that proved the team’s hard work throughout the season independent of the final game’s outcome.
“It’s amazing that we made it there and it was hard at first to feel good about it because all we could really think about was the loss, but when you put it in perspective, we made it all the way to the championship game,” senior co-captain Kalley Armstrong said. “We probably weren’t expected to be in that game, so the whole process and the whole journey was an experience that no one will forget.”
The team Stone took over when she returned from Sochi was also one that had experienced a large amount of success the season prior. Interim head coach Maura Crowell was able to take the team to the NCAA Tournament and clinch an Ivy League Championship as well.
Coming back to Cambridge, Stone was also faced with the challenge of getting to know her new team. With last year’s class as well as this year’s freshmen whom Stone had not seen play yet, there were a total of 13 new faces on the ice for the Crimson.
“I think the first semester was a big transition for me and for the players because I really didn’t know half the team,” Stone said. “You know the kids in the recruiting process, but until you see them on campus you don’t really know.”
The beginning of the season saw the team weather struggles especially seen in the group’s 10-2 loss to then top-ranked Boston College on Nov. 28. After that, the team was able to turn its season around and won its next ten games, which Stone credits to the team’s resilience.
“The transition took some time and that’s part of the reason I think the second part of the season went a lot smoother,” Stone said.
From the bench, Stone was able to return to her place of leadership she had held down for since 1994. After this past year’s loss to Minnesota in the NCAA Championship game, bringing home a national championship is still the next step forward in a career that has included 11 Beanpot titles, eight Ivy League Championships, seven ECAC regular season titles, six ECAC Tournament championships, and four NCAA Championship appearances.
“The program’s goal is to put ourselves in position to win a national championship,” Stone said. “It’s very hard to get there and we are certainly proud for getting there. We put ourselves in the position to win and just came up short, but for this group of kids, to win every other title in a hockey season was fantastic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the season in the balance, the Harvard men’s basketball team went to its tried-and-true late-game play—giving senior wing Wesley Saunders the ball.
Less than 90 seconds beforehand, junior point guard Siyani Chambers had splashed a three through the net as part of an improbably four-point play. Harvard, which had trailed all game, chipping away in the second half but never getting equal, had taken the lead. A deafening roar had silenced the loud Tar Heel fans, who began to murmur in apprehension.
Four straight UNC points later, it was up to Saunders to shoulder the load again. He’d shouldered the task before—hitting late-game baskets to clinch wins against Brown and UMass. A versatile guard who shot 43 percent from behind the arc and averaged over four assists a game, Saunders created enough spacing to leave teammates open and made the pass when needed most.
It was he that assisted Steve Moundou-Missi on the jumper that gave the Crimson the league championship, and he who accepted, without complaint, a final play run for sophomore Corbin Miller, Harvard’s best high-volume distance shooter.
“The play was actually set up for Corbin to get the ball, [to] try to get him open off a screen,” Saunders said afterwards. “I looked for Corbin, but they obviously knew he was a great shooter, so they were kind of cheating towards him.”
When Miller failed to shake free of his mark, it was Saunders left with the ball and clock winding down. Staring down junior Tar Heel swingman J.P. Tokoto—who would later characterize him as one of the top five players he’d guarded all year after being torched for 26 points—he cut back left to create space and let it fly.
As the shot carried towards the basket, Saunders began to backpedal, setting himself up for celebration. But the ball caromed off the backboard and then the rim, a demoralizing end to Saunders’ Harvard career and the capstone on the 67-65 second-round NCAA Tournament loss.
“We thought we had a strategy but it didn’t work,” UNC coach Roy Williams said after the game. “J.P. really did a pretty doggone good job, but he was really, really hard to guard.”
Ultimately, however, Saunders was the main reason Harvard was in a game that scarcely anyone picked it to win. The clear underdog coming into the game, Harvard fell behind 26-12 early—with Saunders scoring the team’s first 10 points. North Carolina was as long and as athletic as advertised, giving the smaller Crimson problems all over the court. Flanked by two starting McDonald’s All-Americans, point guard Marcus Paige orchestrated an efficient offense that shot a scorching 56 percent in the first half.
Overall, the underdogs could not get into a flow offensively and could not get a stop on the other end. Sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan headed to the bench with his second foul before the first media timeout, and eight different Tar Heels scored before anyone other than Saunders got on the board for the Crimson.
“[Saunders] is a terrific all-around player,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s been playing great coming into the game and certainly played exceptionally well tonight. We need him to do so much for our team.”
After an 11-0 Harvard run that pulled the Crimson within three, the Tar Heels scored 10 of the last 12 points of the half to take an 11-point lead at the half. When rookie swingman Justin Jackson hit a three just nine seconds into the second half, the Tar Heels appeared poised to break the game open.
Saunders wouldn’t go down without a fight, however. He hit a trey on the next possession, jumpstarting the rest of the team. With UNC focusing its defense on Harvard’s star, Saunders was able to create opportunities for his teammates. Chambers hit a jumper, Miller knocked down his first three and buckets by Kenyatta Smith, Steve Mondou-Missi, and Agunwa Okolie cut the lead to seven.
Harvard kept coming down the stretch. Ten second-half Tar Heel turnovers allowed Harvard to slowly but surely chip into the lead. A pair of Miller free throws and two Chambers jumpers put Harvard within three as the broadcast cut to commercials for the final time.
The rest—the four-point play, the ensuing 4-0 UNC run—set the stage for another of the titanic moments that Saunders had delivered throughout his Harvard career. Ultimately, however, Saunders did not have the answer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some say that goaltenders are at their best when they aren’t noticed, simply carrying out their job without committing errors that inevitably lead to focus being cast on them.
Fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek caught the attention of every fan that was in the TD Garden for the Beanpot semifinal on Feb. 3, pitting the then-No. 6/6 Harvard men's ice hockey team against then-No. 3/2 Boston University. However, it was for all the right reasons.
The third-year standout stopped 63 shots on the night to keep the Crimson in the first round of the annual Boston-based college hockey tournament for as long as possible. While junior Danny O’Regan finally broke through after 82 minutes to send BU to the championship tilt against Northeastern, Michalek’s outing stole the show.
“Steve’s performance was incredible,” fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally said. “He stood on his head.”
After a late second period goal from BU knotted up the snow-delayed contest at three goals apiece, the game would remain scoreless for the next 42-plus minutes. Even after Michalek showed signs of physical limitation late in the game that he later attributed to cramping, the Glastonbury, Conn., native went on to save 24 shots over the course of the two overtime periods, waiting for his team to deliver the game-winner that would never come. Terrier goaltender Matt O’Connor only recorded 31 saves in the contest, but it was enough to send BU to the finals.
Early in the first overtime, the Terriers seemed poised to end the drama early. Terrier forward Evan Rodrigues was able to find freshman forward Jack Eichel just above the left side of the crease. As soon as BU fans stood in anticipation of the game-winner, Michalek sprawled to his left to make a sprawling save on the eventual Hobey Baker Award winner.
“I thought Steve was tremendous throughout the game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
“He was just so focused. He was dealing with cramping up. My memory in particular [is of] the save he made in overtime that was made across the crease. He reacted late...and slashed his pad out to the left. The overall competition level, the focus and intensity and the calm under pressure under that many shots made it a memorable performance.”
O’Regan’s goal came on an odd-man rush off a turnover in the defensive zone from junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo. Rodrigues stole his pass, taking advantage of a two-on-one opportunity by sliding a backhand pass over to his linemate. All Michalek could do was watch O’Regan rocket the puck past him into the netting to finally put an end to the contest.
“It’s too bad we couldn’t come through for him,” McNally said. “But I don’t think that’s a performance that will be forgotten soon.”
The goaltender's performance will sit in the Harvard record books for the foreseeable future. His 63 saves eclipsed a 45-year Beanpot record set by Boston College goaltender Jim Barton by more than ten saves and also broke the Harvard program mark, which had been held by Jim Blair ’86.
In a game where Harvard struggled to find consistent offense after the first period, Michalek’s stonewalling in net were key in giving Harvard any chance of victory over its crosstown rivals. The Crimson averaged less than six shots on goal per period after the first 20 minutes of play, while the Terriers put 60 shots on Michalek over the same time frame.
“You talk about a game that we shouldn’t have been in two overtimes,” McNally said. “He made some saves I still can’t believe he made.”
Michalek’s performance in early February highlighted a solid campaign for the fourth-year. The Minnesota Wild prospect ranked sixth in save percentage in the conference, only three hundredths of a percent shy of third place in the ECAC. Michalek's play in the postseason was critical to the team’s run to the conference championship, as he only allowed just over an average of two goals per game in the squad’s seven games in the ECAC postseason.
Michalek had a similarly solid performance in the rubber match of the Yale series, stopping 40 of 42 shots over 96-plus minutes, which allowed for junior forward Jimmy Vesey to finally put away the game-winner and send his squad to Lake Placid.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a share of the Ivy title on the line and just the Game standing between the Harvard football team and an undefeated season, the Crimson, after trailing for much of the game, held a three-point lead over Penn in the fourth quarter. Without its first-string quarterback for the sixth time, the Crimson’s offense was struggling to put points on the board against a team that was just 1-8.
Then, with just under seven minutes to go, junior running back Paul Stanton barreled 14 yards into the end zone to complete the comeback, giving the Crimson a 34-24 lead that proved final. The score was Stanton’s third of the game, and the junior’s season-high 235 yards could not have come in a better game.
“We knew we had to come back because that would have been our season,” Stanton said. “We weren’t playing for the tie, especially after last year. We knew we wanted to win the championship outright.”
A week later, Harvard took the outright Ancient Eight title in a nail-biting win over the Bulldogs, a feat that would have been made much more difficult without Stanton’s performances. After a breakout sophomore season where he recorded 936 yards and 15 touchdowns on the ground, Stanton continued to impress, rushing for 990 yards and 11 scores in 2014.
“Having a whole year under my belt, I was able to calm down and relax while I’m running and be able to break the longer runs by just being patient,” Stanton said.
In a year where the quarterback position was plagued by uncertainty due to starting senior play-caller Conner Hempel’s injured back and an injury-riddled receiving corps, Stanton shouldered much of the team’s offensive burden and gave the Crimson a reliable weapon behind a formidable offensive line.
“You put a good offensive line with a great running back, your offense is pretty much unstoppable,” Hempel said. “If they start putting everybody into the box, that opens up the pass game. We had an overall, well-rounded offense this year, and it’s tough to stop when you have a run game and a pass game.”
Despite battling a high ankle sprain early in the season, the junior tallied six 100-yard-plus rushing games on the year and averaged 110 yards per game—behind only Yale’s Tyler Varga for the lead in the Ancient Eight. Stanton is also poised to break several school records—with just three seasons under his belt, he is already ranked fourth in school history with 27 career touchdowns on the ground and seventh in career rushing yards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the best of times.
Harvard men’s hockey coach Ted Donato ’91 refers to the Crimson’s 2014-2015 campaign as “a tale of three seasons.” For the most part, his team’s year followed a basic template that is among the most compelling in sports: 1. Team exceeds expectations early to become a contender. 2. Team experiences adversity and attracts doubters. 3. Team overcomes adversity to win a championship.
The three stages of Harvard’s season hinged on a knee injury in late January, when fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally faced the most important decision of his career. At the time, calling it a year and getting surgery probably made the most sense for the NHL prospect, but McNally thought differently.
He looked at a team and saw a group that had gone from unranked in the national polls to No. 1 in the PairWise Rankings. He saw a collection of individuals reaching their potential at the same time.
More importantly, he saw a team full of leaders—from co-captains Kyle Criscuolo and Max Everson to goal-scoring champ Jimmy Vesey, marathon goaltender Steve Michalek, sophomore stars Alex Kerfoot and Sean Malone, breakout center Tyler Moy, and beaten-but-not-broken winger Colin Blackwell.
Going against the odds, McNally elected to rehab his knee with a shot at a late-season return.
After an 11th-place ECAC finish in 2014, Harvard had entered the 2014-2015 season with a primary focus on leadership.
Donato wanted to build a team that could withstand the trials that had hamstrung other talented Crimson squads. He brought in veteran associate coach Paul Pearl from Holy Cross. When his roster arrived in the fall, the team placed a renewed emphasis on team-building and community service.
Looking back, the 11-year head coach feels that the results showed on the ice.
“I think it was a fun team to watch, and I think it was a fun team to play on,” Donato said. “Guys were great teammates and supported each other and were unselfish. We had a real team-first attitude.”
Donato considers McNally’s decision particularly selfless. The Crimson struggled to find answers on the blueline in the defenseman’s absence, winning only four of their last 12 regular season games, yet McNally continued to work with an eye on returning in the ECAC tournament, holding on to the faith that his boys would give him a chance.
He got that chance in Game 3 of the ECAC quarterfinals in New Haven. With two shots—a goal with 3:35 left in the third period and an assist with 3:15 to go in the second overtime—McNally affirmed his team’s spot among the nation’s best and defeated his team’s greatest boogeyman.
“Every guy in the locker room was about as happy as they had ever been in their life,” McNally says, recalling the moments after Kerfoot tipped his overtime shot onto the stick of Vesey for the game-winner that sent Harvard to its first conference semifinal in three years. “It was a special, special moment.”
In Lake Placid, the Crimson clinched its first Whitelaw Cup and NCAA tournament appearance since 2006. The next weekend in South Bend, Harvard’s tale of three seasons went off-script, yet Donato’s recruits had proven their talent and learned something in the process.
“I think we learned as a team the type of commitment and the type of character that it takes to persevere and how difficult it is to win consistently,” Donato says. “[We learned] how rewarding it is when you do things the right way and you push yourselves to be the best student-athlete you can be in every aspect that would entail.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Malcolm Johnson was a highly recruited sprinter coming out of high school and a centerpiece of a strong incoming recruiting class for the Harvard men’s track and field team and had little trouble finding success in his first year of collegiate competition. Already, Johnson has established himself as one of the best sprinters in the Ivy League and challenged Crimson records from the start.
“I was pleased with Malcolm’s performances [this season],” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Winning the [Indoor] Ivy League Championship was a great accomplishment for a freshman.”
The Sylvania, Ohio., native ran his way into the Harvard record books this year, claiming the second-best time in program history in both the 60 meter and 200 meter dash with times of 6.75 and 21.62 seconds, respectively.
In addition to placing his name in the record books, the rookie claimed the 60 meter title in his first ever Ivy League Heptagonal competition, edging out fellow rookie Carrington Akosa of Princeton with a time of 6.88 seconds.
Johnson would follow up his indoor season with a solid outdoor campaign, taking first place in the 100 meter dash at the Harvard-Yale meet with a time of 10.50 seconds. The freshman also placed sixth in the same event at outdoor Heps coming in at 10.83 seconds.
While the rookie has been able to make a strong impact for the team from day one, Johnson has experienced a drastic change in his approach and amount of time dedicated to the sport.
“The hardest to transition to is the amount of time that I put into training,” Johnson said. “In high school I was training for probably an hour and a half every day, and now I’m training three hours…. Now it’s just harder for my body to recover.”
Though the transition from high school to collegiate competition has had its bumps, the rookie believes that a collegiate schedule—where classes are spread out as opposed to having a chunk of seven to eight hours straight of school—has allowed him to adapt accordingly.
Though there are still many variables left to improve in Johnson’s career, his performances this season have given Saretsky a reason to believe that his times and finishes could be the rule, not the exception, in his career with the Crimson. Ultimately, the Harvard coach is excited for what the freshman has to offer the next three years.
“We haven’t seen the full impact that [Johnson] can have,” Saretsky said. “I’m hopeful and excited for next year…we’re going to see even more improvements and more consistency from Malcolm and that group.”

On Nov. 28, 2014, then-No. 1/1 Boston College handed the then-No. 7/7 Harvard women’s ice hockey team the most punishing loss it would see all season. Across town at the Conte Forum on a Friday afternoon, the Eagles trounced the Crimson, 10-2, with a stretch of eight unanswered scores coming in the second and third frames. It was certainly not the early-season boost that Harvard sought.
The loss wasn’t all that out of the norm. Harvard had not beat BC since February of 2010, with a 5-0 victory in the opening round of the Beanpot—losses and ties abounded in the interim seasons.
For nearly five years, the local rivalry was one-sided. But with a revitalized team roster, the Crimson soon ended its drought. Riding the momentum of both a 9-2 win over Boston University in the first round of the Beanpot and a decisive weekend sweep of Yale and Brown, Harvard finally nabbed the long-awaited win at a time when it really counted. On Feb. 10, the then-No. 4/4 Crimson won the Beanpot title with a 3-2 victory over then-No. 1/1 Eagles at home at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The win was superlative in many ways—it was the first loss of the season for BC and Harvard’s first Beanpot Championship since 2010, giving the Crimson its 14th tournament crown.
“I think that learning what a loss feels like, I hope it helps us in the future, and [so does] playing in a tournament game” said BC coach Katie King-Crowley after the game. “We’re fortunate.”
While the Eagles may have struck first—a goal just a minute and a half in by Andie Anastos put BC on the board early on—Harvard prevailed as a trio of Harvard skaters—junior Mary Parker, rookie Karly Heffernan, and junior Miye D’Oench—notched scores to eke out the win, despite an unassisted goal from BC’s Haley Skarupa that gave her team a brief 2-1 lead midway through the second frame.
“One of the big turning points was when actually when BC scored their second goal,” said Harvard coach Katey Stone after the game. “I think it really woke us up and ticked us off a bit. We were a different hockey team after that than we had been in the beginning.”
On the other end of the ice, then-junior Crimson goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer held steady for 30 saves, paving her way to the Beanpot MVP. Tight defensive play proved crucial all around, as BC shut down four of five penalties and Harvard killed all seven shorthanded situations.
More notable than the quality of play was the significance of the win. In one game, the Crimson reversed the fortunes of a gritty local rivalry, handed the national favorite its first loss of the season, and ended the Beanpot drought.
“What a great hockey game to be involved in,” Stone said. “Two great teams on the ice. A lot of talent. A lot of emotion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March 30, 2011, was a dreary day in Winston-Salem, N.C.—cold, gray, and wet—but that didn’t stop me from getting to BB&T Ballpark early. The Class-A Winston-Salem Dash were hosting the Chicago White Sox, and I was in desperate need of a distraction. After nearly four years of high school, I was about to move a step closer to finding out where I would head next as the last college admission decisions were supposed to come in any minute.
I remember little from the day, except for constantly refreshing my phone, huddling by some heat lamps in the concourse, and the stomach-drop feeling I got during our drive home when I found out that I had gotten into Harvard.
Fast forward 10 weeks to June 6, a perfect late-spring day interrupted by a text I will never forget.
I was sitting on the couch—exactly where I had celebrated my acceptance to Harvard with my family—when my phone buzzed, the same phone that had brought such great news 68 days prior.
“I know it shouldn’t be sent through text,” read the message from my friend Hamid, “but Mehdy died.”
I remember the rest of that awful day vividly. Sinking into the leather, retreating to the bathroom, crying well into the night.
Mehdy Hazheer was the greatest person I’ll ever know. He had befriended a 90-year-old at a local nursing home and helped at his dad’s mechanic shop. He took a life-changing trip to Iran and wanted to return to the Middle East one day as a doctor. I could go on and on.
Forty-seven days before he passed, we both toured Harvard with wide eyes during Visitas. We stared at murals in Widener Library, threw a frisbee in the Yard, and tried to eat a meal in Annenberg Hall but kept getting distracted by the stained glass windows and inspiring company, chatting about all of the things he would never get a chance to do.
Going to Harvard without him was hard. I could feel his absence in all of the places we had visited months earlier. But I did not feel sorry for myself. I came to recognize that each day was another opportunity to achieve my dreams. And so I lived out these last four years, motivated by the incredible opportunity of a Harvard acceptance letter and the great misfortune of a deserving friend not getting the same chance.
I’m reminded of that dualism every time I open my wallet. On the left sits my Harvard ID, and on the right, a photo of Mehdy and I from our middle school graduation, the last graduation he had.
***
Wins and losses, that’s what I want this parting shot to be about, which is why I led with the greatest success and the most painful loss of my life to date.
I covered a lot more victories than defeats for The Crimson, something like 140 to 30, but it’s the losses that have stuck with me.
It started with Princeton’s stunning 39-34 comeback win over Harvard during my first season covering football.
Treavor Scales ’13 said the fourth quarter felt surreal as the Tigers eliminated a 24-point deficit. The bus ride back was dead silent the entire way.
“We were all awestruck,” he said. “We didn’t understand what had just happened.”
Coach Tim Murphy said he could not eat for two days afterwards. He’s coached nearly 200 games but said he’ll never forget that one.
Almost all wins feel the same. Getting into Harvard or beating Yale, it follows the constant rhythm of preparation, hope, attempt, success, and celebration. And as a result, the details of each blend together.
But every loss hurts differently: unexpected and debilitating.
My run as a Crimson writer ended with another loss, this one in Jacksonville, Fla., after senior Wesley Saunders missed what would have been a game-winning three-pointer against North Carolina in the NCAA tournament.
Had the shot gone in, the game would have been an all-time classic, and yet what turned out to be yet another win by one of the sport’s powerhouses somehow seemed even more powerful.
Afterwards, co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi said the sting of the loss might last forever. The thrill of a 52-50 victory over Yale in the Ivy League Playoff a week earlier had hardly lasted a few days.
I understood.
***
Having to ask players about heartbreaking losses had long been my least favorite part of sportswriting. The losing was also the part of being a sports fan that turned me off, or so I thought. I could not watch the final seconds of a big game because I couldn’t bear the thought of sad faces being shown for my enjoyment.
But, given whom I was rooting for, I had tons of opportunities to come to terms with defeats.
Start with my favorite football player, Brett Favre, who threw costly, season-ending, tear-inducing interceptions in the playoffs as an annual ritual. Yet he never stopped throwing.
And then there is my basketball team, the San Antonio Spurs. They’ve won plenty in my lifetime, but they have also suffered some horrible losses. The season I felt closest to them was 2013-2014, a year after they had crumpled me in a hotel bedroom and left me welling with tears in a Wyoming bar by losing Games 6 and 7 of the NBA Finals. After they won the Finals the following year, the bond just was not the same.
Eventually, I came to see the power of losses. They make famous athletes feel relatable and their struggle feel shared. I came to believe sports belong at top universities because it’s the rare field in which successful people are allowed to fail, expected to fail, and can learn from failing.
During a time of painful loss in my life, I needed to see how others dealt with it and to learn that loss can lead to good things.
Wins all feel the same because they are conclusions, I realized. A win is just ecstasy, but a loss is more than misery. Losses linger for years. Maybe forever. They affect you. They are not ends. They represent parts of a bigger, more interesting story.
Wins count. Losses matter.
Sports taught me that. Harvard taught me that. Mehdy taught me that.
And just in time. Now, I understand that when I leave my Harvard ID behind very soon, it’s just another loss, not an end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve gotten used to the sounds of a newsroom. The clicking of a dozen keyboards and the quick, clipped footsteps of writers on deadlines. But this was, necessarily, quite different.
This had beeps to go along with the click-clacks of keys, an intercom that replaced the cross-room shouts of the managing editor. My left arm was squeezed—increasingly so—but I kept on typing. I had just 50 words left to jot down, so I went right on clicking as the room around me stayed humming.
I was 17, a freshman in college, and one of the rookie journalists in the throes of The Harvard Crimson’s comp process. I was working on my first-ever assignment—and I was working from a hospital bed.
The spot wasn’t ideal, but the deadline was set. Seven o’clock. It seemed only fitting that I would finish the article right as the machine unclenched my left arm in a final sigh of release—and, to me, in a sign of congratulations.
I walked away from the room, the building, and the hospital elated. I felt that if I could write in that environment, I could certainly write in a newsroom. And, more importantly, I knew that if I loved writing in that environment—heartbeats monitored, hospital dress and all—I would love, and be passionate about, journalism anywhere I went.
Nearly four years, countless Crimson all-nighters, and quite a few heartbeats later, that initial assumption still rings true. Even though the hospital is no longer in sight, my inclination towards journalism hasn’t waned. It has built as the words typed and the pieces edited have built in their own right.
A couple of months ago, I sat in a near-empty terminal in the Philadelphia airport, waiting for my connecting flight to Jacksonville, Fla. I was on my way to the NCAA Tournament to cover the Harvard men’s basketball team as it took on perennial powerhouse North Carolina. As I sat there, I tried to pen a column on what stood out to me as the salient characteristic of Harvard hoops—a team I had spent the majority of my college career watching and writing about, analyzing and interviewing.
The thing about really good players, I wrote, is that they often turn reporters into pretty poor journalists. I noted that it’s easy to fall into clichés, looking down at your notes after a game and seeing a surfeit of platitudes and truisms stuck between play descriptions, and that it’s easy for your hands to hover, frozen, over your notebook, forgetting to jot down what happened at a given moment as you attempt, instead, to mentally calculate how that player made it from the perimeter to the basket in just one seemingly lazy, careless dribble. I said that it’s easy to finish a graf and realize that you’d already written a very similar sentiment—in just as many words—in a previous gamer, about the same group of players.
I wrote that column thinking back on the 2013 NCAA tournament in Spokane, Wash., when, somehow, the Crimson climbed back into a contest that it had no business fighting in. Down 16 in the second half, the team shot and stole, stifled and scrambled its way into contention, and then into the lead, knocking down shots time and time again in front of a Harvard fan section that was giddy with the game.
The Crimson lost that matchup. The opposing squad had responded to Harvard’s rally, and had undercut the underdog even while the crimson-clad crowd had begun its “I Believe” chant, roaring to the tune of their team’s short-lived, big-stage 18-point comeback.
There was plenty to write about when the final buzzer sounded. But, for a moment, my co-writers and I just sat there, facing the court, hands not typing, pens not moving. Just like those tremendous players that transform your articles into an exercise in clichés, games and moments like we had witnessed in Spokane are just kind of inexpressible in their excess of storylines, indescribable in their glut of narratives.
Throughout the long days and the even longer nights as a student reporter these past four years, I’ve realized that, paradoxically, the moments in journalism that are the most special are the ones when you’re not writing—the ones when you don’t know what to say. These are the empty, blank spaces of journalism, the John Cage’s 4’33” of reporting, when, with the pen suspended above your notebook, you just appreciate the moment you’re in and the art of what you’re doing.
I had one of those moments when I finally arrived in Jacksonville back in March. At halftime of the game, my co-writer turned to me and asked if I needed anything while I began to compose the story. I turned to him and said what I needed was a lede, a first sentence; there was just too much to say, and I was desperate to convey the passion of the at-capacity arena within the dispassionate 12-point, Times New Roman typeface of my word document.
Another one of these instances came in December, when I sat down with my co-chair and tried to figure out how we could sum up a year’s worth of games and grafs, highs and lows in a 750-word column that was to be printed that night. Unable to string together a series of words that would adequately describe the wonderful-yet-gut-punching, thrilling-yet-deflating 12 months we had spent on the paper’s masthead, I thought back to that hospital room I had waited in all those months ago, a time when, similarly, I didn’t know how the story could possibly come together, how I could write in that setting.
But the thing about journalism is that it’s the narrative, not you, that crafts the heart of the story. And by just sitting and absorbing those incommunicable, inexpressible moments, you can often begin to envision the pages of your notebook starting to fill up with your loopy scrawl—you can often begin to see those empty spaces of journalism becoming crowded with syntax and sentiments, with words crossed out and clauses underlined as you try to find the right diction to describe the indescribable.
My time in the halls of The Crimson has centered largely on athletics, but, to me, the term sportswriting contains so much more than just game stories. It’s about finding and expressing the passion inherent in the moment that you’re covering, just as I, four years ago this past September, found my passion in a fluorescent-lit, humming hospital room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since I can remember I’ve argued with my friends about sports.
I grew up in the ‘Golden Age’ of English national football (the sport you play with your feet and a ball, not your hands and an egg) and I can still rattle off the players at every major tournament from 2002-2010. The inability of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to figure out how to play together in central midfield is one of the tragedies of my lifetime.
The 2002 World Cup Quarterfinal in retrospect was the best chance our team got. Playing the almighty Brazil, the playground was furious with chatter. Just how insanely good was Ronaldinho? Was Rivaldo a straight up cheat? Would Michael Owen step up, and more fundamentally, how could we survive with Joe Cole at left mid?
For days I remember discussing the various sides of these debates with my friends, and then playing each other in the style of the players to help us figure it out, as if nine-year-olds had that kind of technical ability.
The game, with the infamous Ronaldinho goal and subsequent image of David Seaman crying, was an instant classic, and on some level, I don’t think I’ve ever stopped thinking about it. What were the chances England won if they played again? What if Ryan Giggs had declared as English rather than the Joe Cole fiasco? How often could one of the best goalies in the world get beaten from a free kick over 40 yards out?
Throughout my time growing up, I spent thousands of futile hours arguing over these type of questions. Football, rugby, cricket, tennis—you name it, I spent way too long discussing it. There were never any conclusions, only differing levels of disagreement. Everything was assessed by the ‘eye test,’ and everyone’s eyes are simply different.
On Tuesday evenings at 7:30 each week, in the Owen Room in the Winthrop G entryway, there exist a group of people dedicated to going beyond the ‘eye test.’
HSAC is one of the worst acronyms ever, but I am indebted to the group of students who started the club some 10 years ago, and to [Harvard professor] Carl Morris, whose returning presence is an inspiration to all that encounter him. The Harvard Sports Analysis Collective is about going beyond the ‘eye test’. Trying to put some numbers, some objective analysis, behind the arguments I’ve been having since I could articulate my thoughts is a waste of time—if you want to convince people you’re right. But it’s a waste of time I’ve been more than proud to spend my time on.
HSAC has been where I’ve borne my frustrations with the world of sports. Why do teams kick 19 yard field goals? HSAC has given me the confidence to know they are wrong. Down three with five seconds to go we should foul right? Well maybe—probably not (see John Ezekowitz ’13 for details).
In general though, it was an outlet, an oasis, for one hour a week, where I could spout opinions, mostly random and nonsensical, which would be debated in a meaningful fashion. Russell Westbrook shoots too much I screamed (last season before his MVP explosion), and the room screamed back: Well what does too much mean? Rather than attacking Russell, the debate became about the allocation of scarce resources (shots) amongst efficient actors (Durant, Westbrook, and Ibaka on a good day).
This is what I’d always wanted. Most people disagreed with me. But their attack on my position was not based in rhetoric and hyperbole as most sports argument is, but rather in the correct approach to addressing the question of how many shots Westbrook should take. I will be forever grateful for having such an alternative for my arguments in college. My roommate still thinks Allen Iverson deserved to be MVP.
Ultimately for me though, these arguments really matter. I remember where I was and my state of mind when Henman lost to Ivanisevic in three days; when Jonny Wilkinson drop-goaled England to champions of the world; when Warne hit his wicket in the Edgbaston test; when John Terry missed that penalty; when Diego Forlan stuck a knife in my beloved Fulham’s heart.
Heck as I write this list, I just want it to go on. Nothing has played an emotional role in my life to the extent sports has. I can’t remember where I was or what I was doing when I got into Harvard, but Clint Dempsey’s goal against Juventus will always hold a place in my heart and I know exactly where I was when it happened.
On Tuesday evenings, in Winthrop’s Owen Room, undergraduates will meet and talk about events that matter to them, and about how to analytically think about them. And I am honored to have once been a part of that conversation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing on the right edge of the 18th fairway, I had 147 yards left to the green. An easy cut 6-iron put me 30 feet right of the tucked back pin. The downhill lag putt came up about two feet short, and I tapped in for my par.
Thirty minutes later, the scores had been tabbed, and our goal of qualifying for the NCAA championship finals had fallen just out of reach. I hadn’t known it at the time, but that two-foot putt on the 18th green had marked one of the most special moments of my time at Harvard: It signified the end of my collegiate golf career.
As we loaded up the van one last time and left Notre Dame’s Warren Golf Course, it was hard not to think about the significance that my final putt encapsulated. Just like that, thousands of hours of practice, training, and competition had come to a complete close. But it had been a moment that had passed by without the profound significance I would later ascribe to it.
Sometimes, the sports stories write themselves as remarkable—a touchdown with 55 seconds to go to seal an undefeated season, the jumper from the top of the key that secured the March Madness bid. But undoubtedly one of the most rewarding parts of my time as a sports writer for The Crimson has been unearthing the significance in the less visible—but no less remarkable—moments in Harvard sports.
It was the time when the freshly-minted varsity women’s rugby team walked onto the field to face Brown wearing inside-out grey t-shirts, numbers scrawled on the players’ backs in black marker. The squad’s win in that regular season contest against the Bears would serve as an homage to its Radcliffe roots and springboard an Ivy title-clinching final season stretch.
It was the moment when a then-sophomore who battled dyslexia, ADHD, and an expressive language disorder became the first-ever Harvard diver to represent the Crimson in the NCAA finals in over a decade.
It was all of the regular season victories from the Harvard women’s ice hockey team as the group climbed its way up the national rankings en route to finishing as the runner-up in the NCAA championships.
These are the stories that may not necessarily grab our headlines, but they should grab our attention. At a place like Harvard, it’s all too easy to let the remarkable—we are surrounded by so much of it—fall into the mundane.
Every person has a story. Every sport and every athlete has one too. I hope we keep telling them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Immediately after our last college finals ended, while camping in the woods, my Senior Outdoor Reflection Trip [SORT] of 11 people sat around in a circle, each person reflecting on their time at Harvard. By the time it got to me, it was pouring rain and pitch-black outside, but still, everyone turned to listen to my deep, thoughtful ruminations on the last four years.
Unfortunately, I hate public speaking, so I honestly don’t remember half the things I said because I’m pretty sure I blacked out. I have, however, been doing me for the last 22 years, so I do know that I talked way too fast and probably tried to make a joke that definitely didn’t go over well.
If anyone on SORT 3 reads this, I’m sorry you had to listen to that. This is my attempt to make up for it.
I grew up 30 minutes away in Southborough, Mass., with three younger siblings and two parents who not only went to Harvard, but played basketball and rowed crew here back in the day. Unsurprisingly, sports were a big deal in my family, and in high school I made a very solid case for myself as a future D-III runner. I ended up here instead, and followed in my mom’s footsteps by walking onto the lightweight crew team. I loved the girls I walked onto the team with, and I liked rowing enough, so as freshman year ended, I figured I had a pretty clear idea of what the next three years would look like.
Obviously, I was wrong, and I like to call sophomore year the story of my failure as a varsity athlete. All my friends quit the team, school all of a sudden got a lot harder, and things just sort of went downhill from there. I spent the vast majority of my sophomore fall crying at random moments in public places, and after finishing up the fall season, I quit. The rest of sophomore year wasn’t great, by any means, but I started getting an adequate amount of sleep and stopped bursting into tears in Cabot dining hall.
All of this led me to junior fall, which is when I, as a master procrastinator, finally joined the Crimson Sports Board. I spent most of the comp writing my favorite kind of stories, the ones about teams that people tend to overlook, and making fun of the freshmen, who called me the mom of their comp class and refused to drink with me. I tend to think of junior year as when I actually started my real Harvard experience, and while several things contributed to that readjustment, the Crimson was a significant part of the second half of my college career.
I spent senior week at the end of my junior year sitting in the basement of the Crimson, copy-editing everything in sight and drinking tequila mixed with orange soda at two in the afternoon with Julian Ryan, as he wrote some of the worst puns I’ve ever seen as the kickers under the pictures for the Year in Sports. I shared a one-bedroom apartment with Jacob Feldman for a week (Match15 is due tonight at midnight, fingers crossed), and I got to harass Sam Weinstock in his office at least 50 times, which is an experience I will always treasure. Finally, I found one of my best friends at Harvard as Cordelia Mendez became less “that sophomore in Cabot who’s almost as loud as me,” and more a person that I send way too many texts at inconvenient hours.
Granted, my failure as a varsity athlete is still very real, and I won’t graduate with one of those cool varsity sweaters (although I did get invited to the senior letterwinners’ dinner because they accidentally left me on the email list). I haven’t written an article for the Crimson since January, so I can’t pretend it’s been a huge part of these last few incredibly wonderful and strange months. But still, the sports board, and many things related to it, reverberated throughout my senior year in any number of ways. I would comp again in a heartbeat.
So overall, reflecting on my time at this wonderful, crazy, ridiculous, infuriating institution? My Harvard experience has not been perfect. It probably could have been better, or at least different. There could have been less stress, less heartbreak, more of me actually knowing what was going on as opposed to just blindly making my way to this point. But I graduate in a week with some hilarious experiences and wonderful friends, and I’ll be sad when they kick me out.
Also, I’m sorry I cried so much.

It came down to five seconds on a brisk fall afternoon.
In that brief yet decisive timespan, the Harvard football team went from competitors to victors. From Ivy League contenders to champions. From a dominant team to a historic one.
Those five seconds took place on Nov. 22, 2014, at Harvard Stadium in the 131st edition of The Game. With visiting Yale having completed a furious, 17-point fourth-quarter comeback, the two heavyweight squads found themselves tied, 24-24, down the stretch in what was shaping up to be a game for the ages.
The Crimson offense, bearing the weight of an undefeated season on its shoulders, pushed its way into Bulldog territory. The previously stunned crowd began to buzz with anticipation.
With exactly one minute remaining, the two teams lined up for what seemed to be just another play. Junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer jogged to his spot on the outside edge of the line of scrimmage. Senior quarterback Conner Hempel lined up in shotgun formation, his feet just behind the 40-yard line, his arms readied for the snap.
Five seconds later, it was all over. The Crimson had seized the lead over its archrival, sent its sideline and home crowd into a frenzy, and produced a moment the 31,062 in attendance would never forget.
The Game is always the biggest weekend of the year for the gridiron squads in Crimson and Blue. But this time, the stakes could not have been any higher.
For Harvard, a win meant sole possession of the Ivy League championship and an elusive undefeated season. With a 9-0 record, the Crimson stood just one game away from perfection—something only two other Harvard teams had done in the last century.
A loss would shatter the team’s stride into history. Even more urgently, it would mean being labeled as co-champion alongside rival Yale, which entered the contest with an 8-1 record. It would suffice to say that everything was on the line for the Crimson.
“It wasn’t like we were 9-0 and had the championship won,” Hempel said. “If we would have lost to Yale and went 9-1 and split the championship, to us it would have been like losing the championship.”

That particular Saturday possessed extra electricity, however. Recognizing the importance of the contest, ESPN sent its College GameDay crew to Cambridge to feature the showdown between Harvard and Yale—just the second time the television program had ever traveled to an Ivy League school.
On most Saturdays, GameDay stations itself at SEC or Big 10 campuses. But for one weekend, the big game was at Harvard Stadium.
“We’re used to Harvard-Yale having a lot of publicity,” senior linebacker Connor Sheehan said. “But to have College GameDay come and recognize it, that was something special.... We were doing our best to block out the distractions, but with something that special, it’s very difficult to do.”
All things considered, the 2014 rendition of The Game was one of the most meaningful in recent memory. Both a conference title and an undefeated season hung in the balance for Harvard, and everything was set to occur on the national stage.
Moments before kickoff, to the objection of most of the observing Crimson fans, GameDay analyst Lee Corso produced a live bulldog from under his desk to forecast a Yale victory. A little after half past noon, senior kicker Andrew Flesher booted the ball downfield to begin the championship contest. More than three hours later, Corso’s prediction still hung in the balance, unresolved.
Athletes often know when it is their turn to step up. The Crimson had done it all season long. With injuries at quarterback and running back, along with a host of new faces in the defensive secondary, a number of players had come up big in various moments to keep the undefeated season alive.
So when the play call came in from the Harvard sideline with one minute remaining in the fourth quarter, Fischer knew that it was his turn to perform. Inside the huddle, Hempel relayed the instructions to his squad.
“I know without a doubt that [Hempel and I] definitely made eye contact,” Fischer said. “I kind of just knew that this was it and that we were going to go out there and execute and get it done.”
Like his receiver, the quarterback understood the weight of the moment and that something—delightful or disastrous—was about to take place.
“Once you hear that play call, you know what the deal is,” Hempel said. “You kind of had that feeling in your stomach like, ‘This is going to be it.’”
Over the course of the preceding 59 minutes, Fischer had run a number of slant routes—patterns involving a few steps upfield followed by a quick, roughly 45-degree pivot toward the middle of the field. Many of the junior’s 100-plus receiving yards gained to that point came on those very pass patterns.
The Crimson coaching staff knew that Bulldogs defensive back Dale Harris, who had covered Fischer for much of the afternoon, had the slant imprinted in the back of his mind. So offensive coordinator Joel Lamb decided to take a chance with a slant-and-go route.

Fischer would begin running what appeared to be a normal slant, but after drawing the cornerback in, the receiver would shift course upfield and blow past his defender.
For Fischer, two quick cuts were all it took to make possible something much greater.
“We knew we had the slant-and-go set up,” Hempel said. “Coach Lamb made a great call.”
The first half of the Harvard-Yale showdown was slow and tight. The Bulldogs, who entered the contest with an offense that averaged over 40 points per game—good for first in the conference, registered just a single touchdown in the first two quarters. Harvard similarly struggled, posting only an early field goal to enter halftime facing a 7-3 deficit.
The Crimson faithful had much more to cheer about in the third quarter. Seemingly rejuvenated coming out of the break, the Harvard offense quickly marched down the field and regained the lead after a one-yard touchdown dash from junior running back Paul Stanton.
Two drives later, Harvard coach Tim Murphy employed some good old-fashioned trickery. After taking the handoff from Hempel, Stanton immediately reversed the ball to senior receiver Seitu Smith, who looked downfield and connected with the wide-open Fischer for a 40-yard touchdown strike.
“The last game of the season, Harvard-Yale, Ivy League championship on the line, that’s the game where you kind of bring out all the trick plays you’ve been working on the whole season,” Fischer said. “Leading up to that play, I think the coaches decided that it was time.”
Over the first nine games of the season, the Harvard defense had been flat-out dominant, ranking first in the FCS with just under 11 points allowed per game. The unit demonstrated its explosiveness to the national audience in the waning moments of the third frame.
Anticipating a short pass on the left side of the field from Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts, Sheehan jumped the route, ripped the ball from the intended receiver’s hands, and then raced untouched 90 yards to return the interception for a touchdown.
“It was pretty surreal,” Sheehan said. “To begin, it was a third-down play, and it was crazy loud, especially being in the horseshoe…. I was anticipating [the throw] because of the instructions I got from [junior defensive back Chris Evans], and I was able to make a play on the ball.”
The pick-six gave Harvard a 24-7 lead. With 15 minutes to go, the Crimson appeared to be in the driver’s seat.
However, that seat would quickly be vacated. The next several drives were all about the Blue and White. In a span of less than 10 minutes, the Bulldogs produced 17 points to even the score, leaving Crimson fans with their hands on their heads in disbelief.
Following Yale’s latest score, the Harvard offense took over with 3:44 remaining in the game. It was now or never for the Crimson. And on first down with the ball on the Yale 35, it finally happened.
Racing down the field after making those two cuts, Fischer had only open field between himself and the end zone. But the ball was still in Hempel’s hands. The senior quarterback had been sidelined for most of the season due to injuries to his back and throwing shoulder. His status was unknown until just before game time, when it became clear that he would start the final game of his career behind center.
“[Coming back for Harvard-Yale] meant the world,” Hempel said. “I put so much into that season and to be able to play only four of the 10 games was pretty tough. It was an unfortunate year with injuries, but it just made it that much more special.”
Despite Hempel’s toughness, he was clearly coping with the lingering effects of his injury. In the first half, several of the quarterback’s passes fell short of his intended target. In between snaps, Hempel made visible efforts to loosen up his stiff throwing arm.
“Hempel was still having trouble with his shoulder,” Stanton said. “It was hurting, and you could tell with a lot of his throws that he wasn’t at 100 percent.”
Yet the quarterback never hesitated once Fischer pulled off his slant-and-go. After looking off the safety, Hempel released a strike.
Fischer only had a step between him and his trailing defender. Hempel’s pass could not afford to fall short. As it spiraled through the air, the ball appeared to be on target.
“From my standpoint, Conner’s performance was inspirational,” Murphy said after the game. “He was not 100 percent—he was nowhere near 100 percent…. Conner’s just one of those guys that when he makes up his mind to do something, he’s gonna do it.”
The throw could not have been more perfect. Fischer reeled it in without breaking stride at the five-yard line, avoided a diving defender, and sped into the end zone a step later. Touchdown, Harvard.
“It just shows what kind of player [Hempel] is and how dedicated he is to this team,” Stanton said. “[It shows in] how he fought through the injury and how he made a perfect throw.”
After crossing the plane, Fischer pointed to the stands, ran around the back of the end zone, and leapt into the outstretched arms of senior offensive lineman Mike Mancinelli. A host of other Crimson-clad bodies joined him, seemingly running on air.
“[Fischer] had already had an outstanding game, and that was my go-to receiver,” Hempel said. “I put it up there, he made a great catch, and the rest is history.”
“I actually didn’t see it,” captain Norman Hayes added. “I was on the sideline talking to the coaches about something, and I just heard the stadium go crazy, everybody on the sideline is going crazy. I look up at the scoreboard, and all of a sudden we’re in the lead.”
“It still doesn’t feel quite real,” Fischer recalled. “The actual moment, the presence, the atmosphere at that time was just invigorating.”
As the players celebrated in the end zone, the Harvard sideline rejoiced, leapt into the air, and exchanged joyful embraces. While the Crimson fan section buzzed and jumped in a fluid mass, the Yale section of the stadium was a fixed, unmoving, shocked clump of blue and white.
“If there’s a single image, it was how loud and raucous the stadium was when [Fischer] scored on the slant-and-go,” Murphy said. “Probably the loudest I’ve ever heard an Ivy League stadium, the loudest I’ve ever heard Harvard Stadium. You could’ve been at Ohio State, you could’ve been anywhere. It was just electric.”
That ear-shattering blast, which peaked with Fischer’s go-ahead score, persisted over the final minute as the Harvard crowd attempted to deny Yale’s attempt at a game-tying drive.
The Bulldogs hastened their way to the Harvard 32-yard line but advanced no further; the leash was at its end. As it had done all season, the Crimson defense set its foot down, and junior defensive back Scott Peters picked an errant Roberts pass out of the air for a game-sealing interception.
As Peters lay flat on his back and held the ball up in his outstretched arms, the crowd erupted in one more deafening roar. The Game had been won, a championship had been captured, an undefeated season had been notched.
History had been made.
Ten hard-fought games, weeks of practices, and an offseason of preparation all culminated in five short seconds. As those ticks ran off the clock, the Harvard football team produced a defining, iconic moment that will long persevere in collective memory.

Josephine Pucci began her senior season on Jan. 2 of this year—1,036 days after her final game as a junior.
On the ice at Brown’s Meehan Auditorium, not much appeared to have changed for the veteran defender. She commanded the blue line with a flurry of energy. Her straight brown ponytail whirred around opponents as she drove breakouts with a sense of controlled recklessness.
“I remember just playing in that game and [thinking], ‘I love hockey. This is awesome,’” the Olympic silver medalist said. “It’s fun.”
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team left Providence, R.I., that evening with a 6-0 win. Plus-2 with two shots on goal, Pucci delivered the type of performance that college hockey fans had come to expect years earlier from her.
Over her final three months of competitive hockey, Pucci would help her school to a Beanpot title, a conference championship, and a Frozen Four berth. Yet her consistent play masked an epic journey—one that included a medical battle, an improbable comeback, and a new call to service.
Pucci’s story begins in August 2012.
Harvard assistant coach Laura Bellamy ’13 remembers walking around the Yard excited to start her senior season as Harvard’s top goaltender. But each time she returned to the Dunster suite she shared with Pucci, her excitement would quickly turn to concern.
“Every time I came back to the room, it was dark,” Bellamy said. “Every bit of light was blocked out from the room, and she was usually wearing sunglasses too.”
At the time, there was not much else Bellamy’s roommate could do but rest and wait. At least that’s what Pucci’s doctors had told her.
Weeks earlier, Pucci had impressed the U.S. national team’s coaching staff—including head coach Katey Stone, Pucci’s coach at Harvard—with a display of skill and grit in international play with the Under-22 national development team.
It would be then, however, that Pucci would receive the hit that would change her life. In the third game of a best-of-three series with Canada in Calgary, she was skating for a line change when she felt the cold blow of an elbow to the side of her head from Ontario forward Brianne Jenner.
Pucci knew immediately that she had another concussion—her second major one in eight months. She began to experience the familiar symptoms—nauseousness, fatigue, difficulty walking and reading—only this time more intensely than ever before.
Simple college activities became monumental struggles. Any sort of writing or drawing induced dizziness. A five-minute walk to Leverett dining hall became 25 minutes of stopping and starting.
By the end of September, Pucci decided to withdraw from school, unsure of what to do next. Every doctor she had seen had encouraged her to retire. But Olympic tryouts loomed just nine short months away.
She turned to past and present Harvard teammates for advice and support. Pucci was far from the only Crimson player who had experienced the debilitating effects of concussions. In fact, according to a study of collegiate athletes published in The New York Times, female hockey players experience concussions at a rate of 2.72 per 1,000 player hours—a higher rate than football players (2.34 per 1,000 hours) or any other athlete group in the NCAA.
Among Pucci’s advisors was Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08—a former Harvard defensive standout and two-time Olympic medalist for Team USA. Cahow was in the midst of her own battle with concussions, but she had seen dramatic improvement after two weeks of rehab with Dr. Ted Carrick at a clinic in Georgia. Carrick had captured the ice hockey world’s attention a year earlier for his work with NHL star Sidney Crosby, who credits Carrick’s clinic for his accelerated recovery from a severe head injury.
During the September 2011 press conference in which Crosby announced his return to the NHL, Carrick sat by Crosby’s side, answering questions about chiropractic neurology—a practice that Carrick has become the leading expert in over his 37-year career.
Pucci was intrigued by the possibility of seeing Carrick, but she had her reservations when Cahow first referred her to him in early September. Cahow’s claim that Carrick would have Pucci skating after just two days at the clinic seemed too good to be true when Pucci could barely walk.
“I was pretty skeptical,” Pucci said. “I thought, ‘What else can you do for a concussion other than rest?’ That’s basically what any doctor has ever said.”
Carrick remembers meeting Pucci in October 2012.
“Josephine was a typical example of most of the patients we’ve seen,” recalled Carrick, who spoke to The Crimson with Pucci’s consent. “They’re very scared, their lives have been changed, and treatments haven’t worked for them.”
In 1984, Carrick founded the Carrick Institute for Graduate Studies to train medical professionals in a unique approach to treating vestibular syndromes—disorders involving the processing of sensory information related to balance and movement.
Upon her arrival at the clinic with Cahow, Pucci went right to work.

Carrick and his associates ran her through a battery of tests and developed an individualized treatment plan for Pucci that involved three-to-four daily sessions of various exercises and forms of sensory stimulation.
The exercises ranged from the mundane, such as eye exercises in which Pucci focused on dots on a piece of paper, to the extraordinary, such as rides on the “GyroStim”—an amusement park-like device that turned Pucci upside-down and around in a particular series of spins designed to rebalance her vestibular system.
“I was fully committed to the program that they gave me,” Pucci said. “It was all day, every day pretty much…. It was like camp almost.”
Within 24 hours, Pucci began to feel incremental improvements. After two days at the clinic, she was, indeed, skating—performing a variety of light gliding exercises.
The new treatment protocol offered Pucci an alternative to lying in bed—a proactive way to treat her symptoms. The early improvements fed her sense of competitiveness.

“I was very religious with what he had given me,” Pucci said. “Everything I was doing was very repetitive.... But everything had a specific purpose.”
Her experience at the clinic also fed her interest in studying the brain. After moving to Boston in February 2013 to train for Olympic tryouts, she began volunteering in a lab at Massachusetts General Hospital under concussion specialist Mike Whalen.
With each month, Pucci gained strength as she trained at Edge Sports Center in Bedford, Mass., alongside now-senior Harvard teammate Marissa Gedman, who was rehabbing a lower body injury that had forced her to withdraw from school shortly before Pucci. Each time Pucci visited her former roommate, Bellamy could see signs of improvement.
“Every time she came back, she seemed a little more energized by the work [she] had done [with Carrick],” Bellamy said. “She believed in what he was doing.”
Pucci’s strict discipline during her comeback journey did not surprise her father Vic, a retired NYPD policeman from Brooklyn, N.Y., who learned to ice skate so that he could coach his three daughters through their first few years of hockey in Pearl River, N.Y.
“She always had a way of keeping the distractions out,” Vic said. “She has a good focus, a good discipline, and a good way of knowing what she needs to do to achieve success in whatever she takes on.”
When America’s best players convened in Lake Placid, N.Y., that June, Pucci was ready to impress Stone and her coaching staff again. After seven days of tryouts, Pucci made the first cut. Five months later, she punched her ticket to Sochi.
“Josephine is one of the sweetest people you’ll ever meet, but when you put her in an athletic setting, she becomes a competitive pitbull,” Stone said. “She’s so intense, she’s so concentrated, and she will figure out a way to win.”
“I think that one of the biggest questions that I’ve asked myself continuously throughout the whole concussion experience has been, ‘Is this a fight worth fighting, or do I need to be brave enough to move on and find new things?’” Pucci said.
After an emotional Olympic experience in which Canada completed a furious comeback to edge the United States in overtime of the gold medal game, Pucci confronted the big question again.
Having taken another year off from school to train and compete with the national team, Pucci was anxious to return to student life. After the months of darkness, she finally felt whole, but she knew that one bad hit could change everything. Carrick agreed that any competitive play would involve a calculated risk.
“After coming back from having an injury that sidelined her to the point that the probability of her coming back was null, she came back and achieved things that basically few people will ever achieve in their life,” said Carrick, who welcomed Pucci back to his clinic two months after the Olympics as an intern. “That’s sort of romantic…. [But] then she faced a question like, ‘What if it happened again?’”
With the expected return of Pucci, Stone, senior Lyndsey Fry, and junior Michelle Picard from the Olympic team, expectations ran high for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team in the early fall. When Pucci informed the team that she would not play her senior season, the decision caught Stone slightly off-guard.
“I was shocked initially by it, but I totally respected the decision,” Stone said. “And I was disappointed for her and for us…. The last thing that you want your players to go through is regret, and I didn’t want her to regret her decision.”
Stone made sure that Pucci knew that the team would welcome any change of mind. Meanwhile, Pucci felt comfortable with her decision.
“It’s just so hard to explain the amount of thought and the amount of wait that goes into a big decision like this.” Pucci said. “And I can’t…say this is why I made the decision and this is why it is. But at the end of the day, logically it felt like the right decision, and my gut was telling me to go that way too.”
Back at Harvard, Pucci embraced life as a full-time student, taking five classes during the fall term. She enrolled in pre-med courses and began to visit Boston-area primary and secondary schools through the Sports Legacy Institute, an organization co-founded by former Harvard football player Chris Nowinski ’00 to raise awareness of the prevention, treatment, and study of head trauma in sports.
At the end of the semester, Pucci reevaluated her plans. She enjoyed dedicating herself to something other than hockey, but her success in the classroom also made her more confident that she could contribute to the team without jeopardizing her ability to graduate. After a long thought process, Pucci told the team in late December that she was ready to play.

In Pucci’s first practices back, junior forward Miye D’Oench could see the effects of the senior’s presence.
“You don’t look at somebody who wants to play so badly and not give it everything that you have in practices or in games,” D’Oench said. “She’s a fantastic player obviously, but there was kind of an intangible part of it where there was sort of an attitude shift.”
In the locker room, Pucci was a natural leader. She did not speak up often, but when she did, she always seemed to find the right thing to say.
On the ice, she exuded a veteran confidence while skating on a pair with Gedman. Pucci’s best performance came a month into her comeback, when she led the team with nine blocked shots to upset then-undefeated Boston College in the Beanpot championship.
“She just came up big in the big moments toward the end of the game and showed a lot of poise,” Bellamy said. “I think our team kind of rode that a little bit.”
In the ECAC tournament, Pucci scored the final goal of her career on a dazzling coast-to-coast strike that proved to be the dagger in the Crimson’s first-round series with Yale. Harvard would go on to win the conference tournament for the first time since 2008.
In the Frozen Four, Pucci felt the all-too-familiar sting of a runner-up finish. She had an on-rink view of each of Minnesota’s goals in the Golden Gophers’ 4-1 championship clincher in Minneapolis. Yet Pucci has walked away from competitive hockey the way her coach hoped she would—with no regrets.
“I’ll always feel like I should give more back to the program because it’s given me so much,” Pucci said. “And to be able to come back and play and still be able to walk away healthy—I can’t explain how thankful I am for that.”
Pucci is not finished with hockey completely—she plans to coach at the youth level—but she will celebrate a new stage of her life when she graduates.
Following Commencement, she will take organic chemistry at Harvard over the summer before starting a two-year job in the fall at a neurological lab at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
“I don’t know exactly which direction it’s going to take me,” Pucci said. “But I definitely love research, and I’m really passionate about the brain and neuroscience and concussion awareness.”
No matter what path the 24-year-old chooses, she is poised to serve others. She has already helped athletes like Harvard men’s ice hockey forward Colin Blackwell, who battled his own concussion-related symptoms this year and returned to the squad in time to contribute to his team’s postseason run.
“She was someone I could always talk to,” Blackwell said. “With [my injury] there’s not too many people that I felt like I could talk to…. She helped me so much—she’s like the nicest person of all time.”
During her internship with Carrick, she served as a source of inspiration and encouragement for patients. In Pucci, he sees a difference-maker.
“She certainly has everything that one could imagine, from compassion to knowledge,” Carrick said. “She’s on the fast track to marvelous things in the service of others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked to identify Harvard athletes, you might think of the football team taking the field at Harvard Stadium for The Game, the men’s basketball squad suiting up at Lavietes Pavilion, or the heavyweight crew team racing down the Charles River.
A crowd of 50 people gathering in Pierce Hall 301 to play competitive video games might not be the first group that comes to mind.
Despite still being viewed as a niche activity in mainstream culture, eSports—or competitive video game competitions—are on the rise, both across the country and at Harvard.
Over the past year, eSports have gained publicity on a national scale. In August 2014, Amazon paid nearly $1 billion to acquire the video service Twitch, a website that enables viewers to watch professionals play video games in these sorts of competitions. Although ESPN president John Skipper dismissed eSports as being incomparable to “real sports,” more people watched the 2013 League of Legends World Championship (32.0 million) than did the BCS Championship (26.4) or Game 7 of the NBA Finals (26.3).
Competitive gaming is also gaining traction on college campuses. A much-discussed New York Times article published in December 2014 pointed out that some universities have begun to give athletic scholarships to students who compete in games like League of Legends and StarCraft II.
While Harvard is not quite ready to expand its list of 42 varsity sports to include video games, the gaming community is on the rise in Cambridge.
“The Harvard gaming community has grown a lot in the past few years,” said junior Tony Pietra, who is involved in the Super Smash Bros. gaming community at Harvard. “There are a lot more people playing and involved in the community than when I started as a freshmen…. I think that’s true for the gaming community not just at Harvard, but also around the world.”
BUILDING A COMMUNITY
When sophomore Andy Kim arrived on campus for his freshman year, he sought out a forum to compete in League of Legends but was surprised by the lack of a formal gaming community at Harvard.
“I assumed that since video games are so big, there would have to be a club,” Kim said. “All of my friends from home go to [University of California] schools, and a lot of people play eSports. Even BU had a gaming club. But there was no such thing at Harvard, and I was shocked. The closest thing was board games.”
Kim described the Harvard gaming community as being very splintered initially, with no unified structure. Eventually, Kim posted a message in the Harvard Class of 2017 Facebook group asking if anyone wanted to watch the League of Legends World Championships.
Kim received a response from Jason Shen, a classmate, and the two became friends. Eventually, they began to discuss ideas for making a club for League of Legends.
But the discussion did not stop there. In the fall of 2014, Kim and Shen founded the Harvard eSports Association, and they now serve as its co-presidents. The club aims to connect the disparate gaming communities on campus and has game directors for the Dota 2, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends, StarCraft II, and Super Smash Bros. titles.
“Ever since the club was created, it has given gamers a space and a community,” Kim said. “The fact that we have an officially recognized club speaks volumes.”
Kim also said that the Harvard eSports Association tries to combat the stigma surrounding video games on college campuses.
“One of the tenets that Jason and I wanted for our club was to help with the destigmatization of gaming,” Kim said. “At Harvard, people are hard-working and are judged if they’re seen as wasting time on something not important. But just because you’re playing games doesn’t mean you’re wasting time.”
Now, the club hosts monthly LAN parties in Pierce Hall, where anywhere from 30 to 80 Harvard gamers come to play various games for several hours. The group also competes in intercollegiate tournaments. Pietra competes in Smash tournaments both on campus and larger city-wide competitions.
“Normally, the weekly tournaments in Boston are at bars,” he said. “There could be as many as 50 people at the tournament. I don’t go super often, but a lot of people there all know each other and are very much a family.”
eSPORT OR SPORT
Even with the continued rise of competitive gaming—both on college campuses and nationwide—there remains a debate over what qualifies as an eSport and whether eSports will ever gain legitimacy on the scale of traditional sports.
The debate begins with the term itself, and whether it is an accurate descriptor of competitive gaming.
“I like the term eSports in describing competitive gaming because it makes it easy to understand for someone who doesn’t know what it is,” Kim said. “It’s the electronic version of sports. But it also limits the identity of eSports to be an inferior version of sports. There are similarities, but it doesn't have to be considered a sport for it to be considered legitimate.”
For some gamers, the debate over whether competitive gaming qualifies as a sport is relatively unimportant.
“It depends if you consider chess a sport,” Pietra said. “[Super Smash Bros.] is very much a mental game, outthinking your opponent, and it’s competitive. I don’t know if that makes it a sport, and I don’t really care. eSports is a term to categorize gaming. It doesn’t need to be made into an athletic feat because that doesn’t make sense.”
But Kim sees many similarities between eSports and traditional sports, even beyond the aspects of teamwork, competitive mentality, and muscle memory.
“There is a stark difference between professional and amateur gamers,” Kim said. “That’s what sets League of Legends apart as a sport rather than a game. In a game like foosball, there’s some degree of similarity in that a set of skills are involved, but you don’t see the same distinction between the levels of players.”
Kim further noted that eSports are physically demanding in ways that differ from traditional sports.
“Obviously, I’m not running around,” he said. “But at the same time, there’s a lot more subtlety in video games. In basketball, if your dribble is a little off, it doesn’t matter. But in eSports, success or failure can be decided by subtle, millisecond differences in how you move your character, or attack. You need to be very good mechanically.”
Additional hurdles remain before eSports can achieve widespread acceptance, with the stigma surrounding gaming and the gender imbalance of gaming participants both concerns.
But with the ever-rising popularity of video games and increasing media coverage, eSports are certainly on the rise, regardless of the lingering issues. And at Harvard, the eSports Association is looking to gain more traction on campus after a successful first year.
“Once you open up this club, you find there’s a lot more gamers than you thought,” Kim said. “The LAN parties are habitual at this point, but we’re working on solidifying an intramural system and making our competitive team tryout system more formal. We want to host large tournaments at Harvard that show people that we’re fun and welcoming.”
Kim believes that the growth of eSports on a national scale will be primarily driven through professional showcases.
“There’s professional basketball on TV, and people watch it,” he said. “That makes it normal, and cool. Once professional League of Legends is televised, it will become more mainstream.”
Junior Daniel Abarca, an avid League of Legends player, echoed Kim’s sentiments.
“eSports are pretty neat to follow,” he said. “Just like any other sport, it’s a competition you can watch and bond over with your friends. Is there really that much of a difference between consuming beer and chicken wings whether you’re watching football or a League competition? I wouldn’t say so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 Most of you were small children during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when, as you no doubt learned in history class, the Supreme Court determined that George W. Bush won the state of Florida, and therefore the presidency, by a mere 537 votes. Look around you: That’s far fewer than people than are graduating today. You may have more Facebook friends than that. What if we got everyone here to register to vote?
If you've ever bothered to like someone's post on Facebook, rate a restaurant on Yelp, or review a book on Amazon, you must register to vote. If you’ve ever forwarded a cat video or argued over whether that dress was blue or gold, you must register to vote.
You are the most data-savvy generation ever, and you're accustomed to thinking in terms of rankings, stars, and likes. The political system, which still largely runs on an analog mindset, is only starting to catch up to you, but now that it has, it will gather every data point it can. If you don't bother to register, you will be part of the group included in mournful statements like, “Only one-fifth of eligible voters ages 18-29 voted in the last election.” And as with any product being sold to a consumer base, these numbers get parsed along ever-finer axes of income, race, ethnicity, educational background, and gender, among other factors.
Pollsters, pundits, and campaign managers keep a very close eye on the 18-29 college-educated demographic. How you vote shapes the commonsense understanding of what issues matter to young people now. If you don’t register to vote, you are signaling that the concerns of young people should not be prioritized—after all, you’re not voting.
Many people complain that all politicians are beholden to special interests, and that the American political system is corrupt. Yes, they are, and yes, it is. Every young person realizes this at some point, and I know many of you are tempted to check out. But there are major differences in how the two leading parties in the U.S. think about issues that are probably important to you. If you care about student loans, immigration, marriage equality, racial justice, reproductive rights, and the environment, you must register to vote.
For the most part, the political system is still controlled by people much older than you. As you grow older, that gap will shrink and eventually close. But what history will deem the concerns of “your generation” are being shaped now—by you. If you choose not to participate in voting, your protest—however much it may be rooted in a passionate commitment to social justice—is legible to no one but yourself. No one else sees it. All they see is another young person not voting.
So, if you think #BlackLivesMatter, if you care about access to education, if climate change worries you, if you are concerned about poverty and homelessness, if you want LGBT people to enjoy full equality under the law, you must register to vote. You can do so here: http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 Long ago, it was customary for commencement speakers to tell stories of their successes. More recently, bromides about “failure” have become popular. Entrepreneurs, entertainers, and politicians regale graduates with stories of how it is their failures, not their successes, that should be studied as the graduates go off into the world.
But these “fail tales” are still too rosy to be truly useful. Often they are self-congratulatory stories of failure as the result of “aiming too high” or “trying to conquer the unconquerable.” These are heroic failures or endearing failures, almost always followed by a narrative of redemptive success that reinterprets failure as merely Act I in a classic three-act drama ending in triumph.
So this commencement season, let us put aside both success and failure, and deal with a more difficult topic: Defeat. Loss. Getting your ass kicked. Defeat—it is an event that has a finality that failure, a state of circumstances, lacks. With defeat, the contest is over, and you have lost. Period.
I have spent a great deal of time thinking about defeat. Like all lawyers, I have lost my share of cases; like all political operatives, I have lost plenty of elections. Most pointedly, in December 2000, I earned a Ph.D. in Defeat when I served as general counsel of Vice President Gore’s recount committee. Litigating the most important case I will ever work on, with the highest possible stakes, we were beaten, five-to-four. I will go to my grave knowing that no victory I will ever achieve will erase the pain and consequences of that devastating defeat.
But if defeat fails to offer the obvious glory of victory, and possesses a sting that “failure” lacks, its sharp-edges do provide their own hard-earned benefits.
First, defeat is the most rigorous teacher. As instructors go, victory is like an overburdened graduate assistant, content to let students learn all the wrong lessons from their triumphs: that a modest amount of preparation was enough, that a missing detail wasn’t important, that careful planning wasn’t needed. Defeat is a difficult-but-wise professor, demanding unflinching reexamination of what went wrong, what must be done differently next time, and what beloved tactics must nonetheless be discarded.
Clinton campaign victories in 1992 and 1996 did little to teach us in the Gore 2000 campaign about the importance of ballot design and voter protection. Victory as one of President Obama’s debate advisors in 2008 did little to prepare us for the “Debacle in Denver” in 2012. Each time, it was painful defeats that led to dramatic shifts in our approach for future contests.
Second, defeat can strip away your fears. Major college football teams often schedule “cupcake” opponents to protect their winning records. Triumphant politicians like running unopposed. But once you have been crushed by defeat, you are liberated from fear. There is something oddly empowering about looking in the mirror and, in response to the question, “What’s the worst that can happen?” being able to say, “Nothing that I haven’t suffered already.” The scalding public reviews of our losing strategy in the 2000 Recount battle prepared me for harsh criticism when President Obama asked me to take on the role of Ebola response coordinator in October 2014.
Third, for lawyers in particular, acceptance of defeat is especially important. The lawyer willing to take on a losing cause is a noble tradition in our profession. Most of the great legal victories were made possible by lawyers’ earlier failed efforts to challenge precedent: The groundwork for the civil rights victories of the 20th century were laid by losing fights decades before; the LGBT rights revolution in our own time owes much to lawyers like Larry Tribe who took on, and lost, Bowers v. Hardwick almost 30 years ago.
And finally, no matter your choice of profession, defeat is the “sorting hat” that separates your fair weathered friends from your faithful ones. As you accumulate success in various endeavors, you will find a growing collection of people around you to celebrate each triumph. You can learn a lot about the difference between good, better, and best champagne in these moments. But your real friends in life aren’t the ones who buy you a drink when you win; they are the friends who buy you dinner when you lose.
For the Harvard graduates enjoying their final days in Cambridge, basking in the warmth of late May, and celebrating triumph over theses and tests, papers and paperwork: victory is everywhere around you. But don’t despair. You are young, and you have your whole lives ahead of you. You’ve still got plenty of time to suffer the humiliating losses and painful defeats that will help you achieve your full potential as a person and a professional.

Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joseph R. Biden Jr., was the White House Ebola response coordinator from Oct. 17 to Feb. 13. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1987.

 If you have an opportunity to see “The Diplomat,” the new documentary about the late Richard Holbrooke, do it. It may change your life.
“The Diplomat” will show you what a life in public service actually means, why it matters, and the joy of being a young person involved in the momentous events of your own time.
It’s not that choosing to be an analyst at an investment bank is necessarily the wrong choice. Many of you will do just that, promising yourselves that you eventually will use the money, contacts and experience to “make the world a better place,” as they say on “Silicon Valley.” If changing the world is your goal, however, why not do it now rather than later? Holbrooke’s life shows us what an educated, energetic, idealistic, smart and courageous young person can accomplish by applying talent, time, and effort to the really tough problems of today.
The world doesn’t change because someone like Richard Holbrooke gets appointed in his late 60s to a very high government position. The world changes because someone like Richard Holbrooke, fresh out of college, becomes a foreign service officer, goes to a difficult trouble spot (in his case, Vietnam in the early 1960s), and begins to look, listen, and ask hard, annoying questions.
Holbrooke’s public service path—from working in the field in Vietnam to the 1968 Paris peace talks, to serving as youngest assistant secretary of state in history and ambassador to the United Nations and Germany, to spearheading the Bosnian peace accords of 1995 (which still stand today), to overseeing US relations with Afghanistan and Pakistan, and so much more—was interwoven with stints in the private sector. But his heart and remarkable brain were always in the public sector. He had the “public service gene.” Nothing mattered so much to him as trying to solve big, complicated international problems.
Today, the route Holbrooke took through the federal service is not as attractive as it was to our generation. Lack of trust in and disdain for government are rampant among all sectors of the population. The federal workforce is aging in place with very few openings or opportunities for the young Richard Holbrookes of your generation. But that situation can’t and won’t last. Evolving demographics will create new opportunities for young people.
There are many avenues available to you. You can enter public service with one of the many non-governmental organizations that deal directly with problems and people on the ground in America and around the world (Baltimore, anyone?). Or consider an international agency that is trying to bring order out of chaos on a larger scale. You can work on the Hill or in a think tank on public policies that may help solve the country’s and the world’s most intractable problems. Or you can begin to think about electoral politics and running for public office yourself.
On the eve of the 2016 presidential election, political campaigns offer a unique opportunity to young people. In a campaign you can develop skills—motivational and organizational, geared toward public speaking or focused on the integration of policy with public opinion and politics—which cannot be developed as quickly or effectively in any other endeavor. New tools of communication offer unlimited opportunities that were not available to Richard Holbrooke, and I know you will employ them in ways never before imagined.
Nevertheless, regardless of when, how, and where you enter the fray, there is no substitute for direct, on-the-ground engagement in the real, not the virtual, world. The things that enabled Holbrooke to force change in an impossibly calcified and resistant system—direct, personal involvement; applied judgment and intelligence; a willingness to question and, if necessary, fight prevailing conventional wisdom; sheer physical and intellectual courage—still work better than anything else, as they always have.
In “The Diplomat” you will see how one person actually did change the world, but not without many setbacks, occasional enormous frustration, a huge cost to his family life, and a very sad ending to his story. I consider this film so important that I actually sent David Holbrooke, who made the film about his father, some money to make sure it receives wide distribution, especially to young audiences.
There is mounting evidence that people of your generation have conflated participation in social movements with political participation, and this is a serious mistake for those who seek political and policy change on a massive scale. In some instances—for example, with the dramatically increasing support for same-sex marriage—social media have played a decisive role.
But where the government does play the determinative role, engagement in the political process through political leadership, work in the public sector, and even through the vote are the surest ways to effecting change. The most important decisions and choices will always be made in real government offices by elected and appointed government officials, which is where the real power still abides.
David Holbrooke dedicates the film to “the next generation of diplomats.” Just think about it: That could be you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People keep coming up to me and behaving as though I am an adult.
I don’t know how to get them to stop. It is a very disturbing trend. “No,” I want to tell them. “You don’t understand. I was just looking around for an adult myself.”
There are other signs.
I have actually started to have those conversations that people in Hallmark cards have. Not the ones about golf or forgetfulness or the one where the guy calls to his wife in the next room to remind him about the names of flowers and it turns out that what he’s actually trying to remember is her name. The ones about the things your boss is doing and how much you look forward to vacation and how everyone you grew up with is married and having kids.
All the weird inconveniences of adult life that you thought they made up to lend excitement and color to episodes of Sex and the City are, in fact, real. (Does that reference date me horribly?)
One of the creeping signs of adulthood (other than that your year of birth slides gradually farther and farther out of reach on online forms) is the increasingly persistent worry that you missed orientation.
When you’re on the subway you see people who really seem to have it together. They are wearing dry-clean-only clothes. Their hair is glossy. They are reading the Economist and they are actually caught up on it. They respond promptly to emails and their apartments are well-appointed and clean. They know how to cook Brussels sprouts and remember to buy them.
You, on the other hand, have a refrigerator full of things you are too frightened to throw away because one of them hissed menacingly at you when you last opened the icebox. Once you took something to be dry-cleaned, but it turned out that the dry cleaner’s hours of business only coincided with your schedule during one brief window many months ago, and you are not sure you will ever see that item again.
How, you wonder, do these people do it? When is orientation?
There should, by all rights, be some place where they sit you down and explain how to cook or one or two basic chicken dishes, how to go to bed at a reasonable hour, how not to be the person frantically attempting to change clothes in the back of a taxicab, and how to prevent yourself from reaching the stage where you get most of your nutrition from 7/11. When I was younger and naïve-er, I thought that this place would be college.
I was wrong. In high school, you at least have to get up at a reasonable hour and show up at places on time. College, on the other hand, gave me the sense that I could complete major assignments at 2 a.m. without suffering any repercussions, along with the erroneous idea that in real life, things started after one in the afternoon.
These were, if anything, the opposite of the lessons I needed.
But I mainly thought that if I were an adult, I would notice. This is untrue.
Every so often you will do a thing and you will think, finally, behind this door, there is going to be the item I have so long desired. I will unlock this accomplishment, and things are going to be different. I am going to feel different. I am going to be a Real Human, not a weird puppet-thing with some very obvious tells and a contentious relationship with an old woodcarver.
But you never quite are. Success is like food caught in your teeth: much more noticeable when it happens to other people. If it happens to you, other people have to take you aside and say something.
There are no there’s there.
There are moments that feel vaguely there-like. But I can count them on one hand that has been flayed by Ramsay Bolton.
Life is what happens instead.
There’s no there, but what there is is pretty good. You just have to notice. Days when I measure What Is Actually Happening against some imaginary There, a Magical Dream-World Where All Doors Open To Me and Children Strew Palm Fronds In My Path—those days tend to go less well than days when I look around at what is actually there and think, hey, not bad, today I saw my friends and family and ate a good sandwich. It’s not the capital-A Adulthood I pictured, but it has a lot going for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was a failure until I was 40, and you will be too if you aren’t careful. You probably think that’s not true—that I’m just looking for what reporters call a catchy “lede” to pull you in. After all, I was successful by conventional standards within a few years of graduating from Harvard: I had—and have—a gratifying and well-paying career, a strong marriage, and three children who turned out just fine. How could that possibly constitute “failure"?
My answer is that I failed because I spent too much time thinking about myself. Sometimes I didn’t think enough about my family. I’d let my wife do more than her fair share at home and I was too often insensitive to what was on her mind. Of course these weren’t hanging offenses. I was generally a good husband and father before I was 40—good enough, certainly, to avoid failing grades in those subjects.
But I thought that if I achieved my career ambitions, looked after my family, and treated people with respect, I was successful.
Nope. Not good enough.
I wasn’t doing much for anyone but me and my blood relatives.
I rationalized this by saying that my writing and analysis helped the public understand the world better, just as lawyers can say they are honorably representing clients and business people can say they are creating jobs or inventing a new product in order to “make the world a better place,” as the tech entrepreneurs keep saying on the TV show “Silicon Valley.” The line makes me laugh every time.
Many of you will go into idealistic occupations where you help people every day: teaching, medicine, social work. Others will enter public service by running for office or taking a patriotic pay cut to work in government.
Most of you won’t. You will likely get caught up in the traditional American definition of success—money and acclaim. I’m sorry to tell you that this just isn’t good enough anymore. It’s an incomplete source of satisfaction for yourself and a failure of empathy in the wider world.
Harvard graduates are so ridiculously blessed—so outrageously privileged—that we are obliged to live by a higher standard of decency.
There’s a terrific movement (led by the Franklin Project) underway to make it a cultural expectation—though not a requirement—for every young American to spend a year in some kind of national service, before, during, or after college, just as their grandfathers did during the decades of the military draft.
Maybe you can’t swing that, as I couldn’t. So at least resolve to do something for some cause greater than yourself and your family for a few hours a month. That should keep you out of the failure category.
Too busy? We aren’t too busy to exercise or binge-watch. We manage to fit in the “me time,” just not the “you time.” And by “you” I don’t mean people like you. I mean people who aren’t like you.
When John F. Kennedy, Class of 1940 and the son of an ambassador, skippered a PT boat in the Pacific in World War II, he served with and learned from the sons of butchers and plumbers. For all of today’s diversity, many college graduates can now spend their whole lives without much contact across class lines. They often don’t know anyone who hasn’t gone to college. They don’t know anyone who has served in the military. They’re missing a lot.
When you get out in the workplace, you may figure that first you’ll make that bundle or get that promotion or publish that book, and then—sometime down the road—you can do pro bono work or volunteer in an inner city school or offer your creative ideas to an innovative nonprofit.
That’s just procrastinating on one of the biggest moral challenges of your life.
I’m a liberal but I always loved it on the campaign trail when I’d hear John McCain talk about Americans needing to work for something “greater than one’s own self-interest” or George H.W. Bush say that no American life is complete without service to others.
During the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, launched a recovery program that asked Americans to hang a sticker of a blue eagle in their windows with the motto: “We Do Our Part.”
Around the time I turned 40, I begin to do mine—not all the time, but enough to feel that I wasn’t failing any more. Enough to feel that my life would have the sense of completion that I wish for you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 The current code word being tossed around to protect political correctness from competition in the marketplace of ideas is “unsafe.”
“I feel unsafe” has become the argument stopper on many university campuses. Efforts have been made to shut down controversial events or speakers, some of which have succeeded, at MIT, the University of Michigan, Northeastern University, Oxford, Hampshire College, Smith College, and other great universities on the grounds that students would feel “unsafe.” Students must, of course, be and feel physically safe in their dorms, classrooms, and campuses. That’s what university and city police are for: to protect against physical assaults and threats. But no one on a university campus should be or feel safe or protected when it comes to the never-ending war of ideas.
An important role of the university is to challenge every idea, every truth, every sacred notion, even if challenge makes students (or faculty) feel intellectually uncomfortable, unsettled, or unsafe. There must be no safe spaces in the classroom or auditorium that protect members of the university community from dangerous, disturbing or even emotionally unsettling ideas.
There can be rules of civility that prevent shouting down opposing views, but these rules must be content-neutral, applicable in equal measure to politically correct and politically incorrect speech. Universities must not have acceptable ideas that are given greater protection that unacceptable ones. All ideas must compete on an equal footing in open marketplaces.
But what about ideas that really do make certain individuals or groups feel intellectually or emotionally unsafe—ideas such as opposition to gay marriage, to a woman’s right to choose abortion, to race-based affirmative action, to religion in general or to particular religious or religious practices, to Zionism or anti-Zionism? It is especially these unpopular ideas—some of which were quite popular in the recent past—that today need protection against the forces of political correctness that seek to stifle dissent in the name of safety.
So long as there is no realistic, imminent threat to physical safety—such as an incitement to commit violence against gays, women, blacks, Jews, etc.—the university must assure the safety of the politically incorrect speaker, student, faculty member, administrator or employee. The answer to bad speech must be good speech; the response to false ideas must be true ideas; the protection against dangerous ideas is effective rebuttal, not censorship.
The university should be an uncomfortable place for comfortable ideas. It should be a dangerous place for all deeply felt ideologies. It should be an unsafe place for political correctness or incorrectness. Ideas must live and die on their merits and demerits, so long as those espousing them are kept safe from physical intimidation or threats.
The line between physical safety, on the one hand, and intellectual or emotional safety, on the other hand, will not always be clear or easy to administer, but doubts must always be resolved in favor of freedom of expression, even against claims of unsafety, because it is far too easy to argue that safety is being endangered in ambiguous circumstances. For example, one professor has talked about “the violence of the word”—a metaphorical concept that could spell the end of controversial speech on campus. I don’t doubt that some people really do feel subjectively unsafe when their conventional wisdom and deeply felt world views are challenged, but freedom of expression is too valuable to surrender to subjective feelings. Before speech may be stifled in the name of safety, rigorous objective standards should have to be met.
Freedom of dissent on many university campuses is quickly becoming an endangered species. Many constituent groups support free speech “for me but not for thee.” Ideas that they express come within the ambit of free expression, but opposing ideas that make them feel unsafe are now included in the amorphous category of “harassment.”
The real world into which students graduate is not always a safe place. Students must be prepared to face the cruel realities of obnoxious views that make them feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Sexism, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other awful “isms” still exist in many parts of our own country and in the world. We have the right to try to defeat these pernicious and dangerous ideas in the marketplace. But we cannot censor them in the real world. Nor should we try to protect our students from them as they prepare to enter that world. Instead, members of the university community must learn the best ways to respond to ideas they detest within the framework of a free and open marketplace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gerald L. Chan and his brother Ronnie wrote their names in Harvard history books when they made a $350 million gift to the since-renamed Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in September—the largest single donation Harvard has ever received.
But although the Chans made history by becoming, not without controversy, the first donors to rename one of Harvard’s graduate schools, the brothers are not being nearly as stipulative with their money. The record pledge falls into the unrestricted category, giving school leadership the authority on how to disburse it. The Chans’ one requirement is that the School of Public Health does not spend the money all at once. Instead, funds will be given to the endowment over a five-year time span in order to endow the school far into the future.
Eight months after the historic gift, Harvard’s public health researchers and professors say they have not seen a significant jump in their funding, as the vast majority of the pledge remains to be disbursed. And yet even as School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk prepares to leave Harvard to lead the University of Miami, the Chan gift, and its lack of strings and stipulations, has inspired a fresh sense of optimism at the school’s Longwood campus.
QUIET LEADERSHIP
A School of Public Health alumnus with a degree in radiation biology, Gerald Chan is known, particularly in the Longwood Medical Area, as a science enthusiast. 
“When I meet him for coffee, he just wants to talk about science,” said longtime faculty member and friend Myron “Max” Essex. “‘How do you make a vaccine for this, what do you think about that particular epidemic?’”
Even between his graduation and making the gift in 2014, Chan was involved at the School of Public Health, sitting on an advisory board with input on the school’s ongoing capital campaign. But since the donation, Chan has taken a backseat advising role, at least in some respects.
“[Chan] is one voice of a group of alumni that gives advice and guidance to the dean, but the dean is not bound by any advice,” said Mitchell L. Dong ’75, who also serves on the Public Health School’s campaign committee. “Having said that, [Chan] is a pretty important guy.”
Regardless of Chan’s influence, professors and administrators agree that he is not using his superstar status to sway the school’s research agenda.
“It is unusual, but I think the Chan family agreed to this because Gerald Chan, as a graduate of the school, understands the school and the value of something that is unrestricted,” School of Public Health professor Walter C. Willett said.
Recently, though, School of Public Health affiliates looked to Chan for leadership when Frenk announced his departure just seven months after the gift was announced. Chan had been enthusiastic about Frenk’s capital campaign vision, which sought to advance four major threats to public health: old and new pandemics, harmful physical and social environments, poverty and humanitarian crises, and failing health systems.
“Gerald really liked the vision that Julio had for the school,” Dong said. “He wanted to make a gift for the school and bought into the vision.”
In a speech two days after Frenk announced his departure, Chan energized a crowd of supporters and boosted morale, according to Dong.
“We just lost our leader, but Gerald is here, and he’s supporting us,” Dong said.
ON THE WAY
Though Frenk and his team have worked to allocate the money as they see fit, the pledge’s disbursement timetable means that there will be a “very gradual ramp up” in the amount of funds available, according to faculty member Meredith B. Rosenthal, who serves as an associate dean at the school.
Frenk expects the gift to generate about $15 million in revenue each year, accounting for almost 5 percent of the school’s $340 million total annual operating income “over a number of years.”
The money is coming at a good time. Since 2003, federal funding for scientific research has been put on the chopping block, particularly for the National Institute of Health, which has seen more than a 20 percent decline in its budget in the past 12 years. The Chan gift will allow the school to not only make up for some of those lost funds and stabilize the school but also relieve some of the stipulations of federal funding, Rosenthal said.
“What’s so exciting about this money is that over time it will give a lot more flexibility to future deans to enable them to look for the leading edge and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and encourage risk-taking,” Rosenthal said.
This year, the school increased funds in “modest but meaningful” ways that targeted student financial aid and faculty support, according to spokesperson Julie F. Rafferty. Because most of the money is yet to be allocated, though, professors are making plans to improve some of their existing projects. Professor Dyann F. Wirth, who leads the Harvard Malaria Initiative, said plans to use the funds are in the works.
“We certainly are planning to have both additional students working in this area, and we are developing pilot projects that faculty from my department and from other parts of the University are working on,” Wirth said.
Until the money accrues, professors and administrators hold onto the optimism the promise of Chan’s gift brings.
“The changes are certainly more in perspective,” Rosenthal said. “We can think bigger. We can think in ways that are more creative and know that in the coming five years we will have an opportunity to do things a bit differently.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Stephen Blyth took over the top spot at Harvard Management Company in January, he was catapulted into the role as the public face of one of the world’s most prestigious endowments, but one that has seen a great deal of criticism in recent years for consistently underperforming relative to its peers.
Blyth, who arrived at Harvard in 2006, succeeded previous HMC head Jane L. Mendillo, who was publicly praised by University leaders but also questioned by others for not being effective enough to compete with other endowments. Harvard's endowment was valued recently at $35.9 billion.
In the new position, Blyth faces high expectations from Harvard and its supporters to return HMC to the top of the pack.
SAME PLACE, NEW ROLE
Since Blyth joined HMC in 2006 after spending time at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley’s London office, he has been seen as one of HMC’s premier investors. In 2013, while serving as the head of the fund’s public markets team, Blyth earned $11.5 million in compensation—the highest pay of any employee at HMC—after his primary division returned 16.5 percent, beating the benchmark by 1.8 percent.
Glenn H. Hutchins ’77, co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake Partners and a member of the HMC Board, said Blyth’s investing prowess was what made him an attractive candidate.
“What Stephen brings primarily in my view is the fact that he is a first-rate, world-class investor. I think that’s exactly what is needed for this time period in Harvard Management’s history,” Hutchins said in a phone interview, joined on the call by Paul Andrew, Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications.
University President Drew G. Faust also praised Blyth. “I think he’s asking big questions, and he’s very energized, and I think he’s communicating a lot with the company and the employees are really happy about that and feel very engaged with him.”
Although Blyth does not have the abundance of top-level management experience that Mendillo had when she returned to HMC as the CEO in 2008 after serving as chief investment officer of Wellesley College for six years, Hutchins said that he believes Blyth has the experience to transition.
“You’re right that he's never been a chief executive before, but you’ve got to remember that he has had almost every other kind of other management job at Harvard Management,” said Hutchins, who also serves on Harvard’s elite group of donors, the Committee on University Resources. “He ran the team, he ran the desk, and he ran half of the endowment. He is not without management capabilities.”
Despite coming into the top post with relative discreteness, those close to Blyth, who declined The Crimson’s request to be interviewed for this article, praised him as a great representative for HMC and Harvard as a whole.
“Stephen is a Harvard man through and through,” Hutchins said. “If you observe him as a model for the kind of behavior that you want to have and the kind of person you want to be the CEO of an organization like Harvard Management, you couldn’t ask for a more ideal person: a person who is really committed across a variety of different dimensions to the University’s success and also has a world-class track record as an investor.”
This year, Blyth is taking a leave from his teaching appointment in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as a professor of the practice of Statistics, for which he received a monthly salary of $1. Within the department, he taught Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance,” for which he also wrote the textbook.
FRAMING THE CHALLENGE 
Blyth settles into the top spot at HMC after years of inconsistent performance at the fund.
When Mendillo joined HMC as its CEO in 2008, the American economy was on the verge of free fall. Many of the Harvard endowment’s assets were in illiquid positions such as private equity, which for much of a decade had consistently led to high returns. Despite the practice of using a Policy Portfolio, which set targets for the percentage of the endowment to be invested in different asset classes to manage risk, the financial crisis hit HMC hard. In Fiscal Year 2009, the fund plunged 27.3 percent. 
As a result of the financial meltdown, HMC was unable to provide the University enough liquid capital to cover budgets, forcing the fund to liquidate some of its long-term positions, such as private equity investments, and take massive losses.
University of Chicago Booth School of Business professor Steven N. Kaplan ’81 said Harvard’s recent poor returns have not just been based upon their underinvestment in private equity to gain liquidity, but overall underperformance in the asset class. Over the last five years, HMC has missed its benchmarks in private equity by an annualized negative 0.6 percent. In Fiscal Year 2014, Mendillo’s last full year at the helm of HMC, private equity returned 20.3 percent, under the benchmark of 21.6 percent, the highest benchmark for any asset class.
Harvard’s endowment as a whole has five-year annualized returns of 11.6 percent, below average for universities with endowments of more than $1 billion, 12.1 percent.

To bolster its private equity performance—after all, private equity drove HMC to great heights before the financial crisis—the Management Company hired Richard Hall ’90, who served as head of private equity for Teacher Retirement System of Texas, to manage private equity investments for the fund, succeeding B. Lane MacDonald ’88-’89. Hutchins, a major private equity investor himself, expressed great energy about the hire of Hall. Since FY 2008, the percentage of the Policy Portfolio for HMC dedicated to private equity investment has increased from 11 percent to 18 percent for FY 2015, though Mendillo said last year, before her departure, that the fund was entering into new, more flexible contracts with private equity firms.
“I think we now have a team that has the kind of skill-set and track record to manage that portfolio well, so I am very confident about it,” Hutchins said. “If and when managed well, private equity is a major contributor given its high historical rates of return to the endowment and it’s something I think we should stay committed to.”
While Harvard Treasurer and HMC board member Paul J. Finnegan ’75 has publicly expressed confidence in HMC’s ability to consistently generate value through an active management approach to the endowment, much remains unknown.
Finnegan pointed out in an interview that much of Blyth’s strategy going forward—particularly the areas to which he allocates Harvard’s assets—will be revealed in September 2015 in his first report as CEO. But Harvard will not know about the full scope of his investment philosophy and its results until September 2016, when HMC releases its first report in which Blyth served as the chief executive for the entire fiscal year. Until then, Harvard affiliates appear set to wait with optimism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After walking away from Commencement with a degree in Economics, Alex A. Nesbitt ’15 will head to work at Goldman Sachs. While his studies at the College have no doubt played an important role in preparing him for his new job, Nesbitt’s path from Harvard to Wall Street took an important turn across the Charles River and through Lavietes Pavilion, where he played point guard for the men’s basketball team.
From formal and informal networking opportunities that helped him learn about and connect with potential employers, to lessons learned on and off the court that will help him in his future employment, Nesbitt’s experiences as a student-athlete headed to a career in finance are on par with what alumni and those involved in recruiting say is an established track.
According to The Crimson’s 2015 survey of the senior class, 18 percent of working seniors who responded will head to a job in finance, making it the most popular field of employment. As top schools draw criticism for sending large numbers of graduates to careers in finance, athletes at Harvard are part of a strong network directly linked to the industry. While there is no single route to securing a finance job, there are a number of built-in advantages that make the pipeline from the athletic field to the finance field a large and established one.
CRIMSON CONNECTION
While Nesbitt said he knew that a career in finance was something that he had wanted to try, his connection to the Harvard athletic network was helpful in giving him insight into possible financial internships and employers. From a mix of formal and informal networking opportunities, he learned about various summer internships that aided his decisions in where to eventually apply for jobs after graduation.
“It’s a strong network,” Nesbitt said. “The formal events and informal events are intertwined.”
There are an array of athlete-specific career services made available throughout the year, including information sessions organized by the Harvard Varsity Club and events organized by individual sports such as an Office of Career Services orientation for the football team and a career panel for basketball players.
The Harvard Varsity Club’s executive director, Robert A. Glatz ’88, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
With the significant time constraints that athletes face, OCS Associate Director Deb Carroll said events tailored to athletes are a way to make time for face-to-face interactions that can fall by the wayside in the midst of busy schedules.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s formal or informal,” Carroll said. “For anyone interested in a finance career, it’s making connections.”
Patrick Steeves ’16, who is also on the basketball team, will be spending the upcoming summer with an investment banking internship in New York. While Steeves said a job in finance is just an option that he is considering, he found both current and former players helpful in learning more about the field.
“There wasn’t any specific athlete event that I went to, but talking to basketball alumni and then just seniors on the basketball team that did it last year, I got a good feel for what investment banking is about,” Steeves said.
One link in the men’s basketball network is Thomas W. Mannix ’81, a former captain of the team who began his career in finance over 30 years ago. For the last two decades, he has been mentoring younger players on the basketball team by participating in career panels hosted by the team and helping numerous players through informal guidance, such as giving them the opportunity to shadow him at work.
After leaving his job on Wall Street and moving to the Boston area, Mannix now frequently attends games and encourages student-athletes to seek him out for advice on a range of matters.
“Once I started to have some success in my own career...I volunteered to be a part of mentoring,” Mannix said. “It was way more informal 20 years ago. Now we’ve institutionalized it. We have a day every year where we bring back a bunch of ex-players.”
It is a cycle that will continue into the future, it seems. While Nesbitt will leave Cambridge and Lavietes Pavilion behind, he said he will continue to share advice with younger basketball players as well as with students at the College in general.
“It’s important that we create that culture,” he said.
CLEAT IN THE DOOR
Although athletic experience is just one element of an application, it helps candidates stand out in a crowded job pool and provides an easy point of connection while networking—especially when the recruiters are former Harvard athletes themselves.
Mina P. Mitby ’04, a former ice hockey and field hockey player, now works at Morgan Stanley and is involved in recruiting efforts at Harvard, such as athlete-specific open houses and events such as pizza after practice with female student-athletes.
Mitby said many of the qualities necessary to be successful in athletics, including being hardworking, looking towards a long-term goal, and communicating as part of a team, are transferable to the finance industry. While she added that there a number of experiences that teach these traits, she said there is a targeted athlete recruiting network because it has been successful in the past in hiring qualified applicants.
“Finance is going to naturally want people who have done that before,” Mitby said. “I really love recruiting student-athletes obviously given my background, and I think the skill set is transferable.”
Carroll also said that many of the skills athletes must develop on the field make them attractive to employers, highlighting lessons of resiliency and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment.
“There’s a lot of things that are appealing from an employer perspective,” Carroll said. “They’re really strong candidates.”
And when it comes to interacting with employers, student-athletes said their athletic experience proved helpful in the course of networking during the application process.
After a multi-year career as a professional hockey player, Ben Storey ’99 now works at the Bank of Montreal. He said that in the course of networking, telling his story of being a student-athlete at Harvard has helped open a lot of doors. Especially living in Canada, Storey said his hockey career often comes up in conversations.
“There’s a lot of people who are more interested in that than the original purpose of the meeting,” Storey said. “When people hear the experience you’ve had, you earn a bit of respect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This morning, over 1600 Harvard undergraduates will process into Tercentenary Theater as seniors and leave as alumni. It is one of life’s seminal moments, when a student enters the “real world” beyond the banks of the Charles. We wish these seniors nothing but the very best.
Dexter Gate, near Wigglesworth Hall, is emblazoned with the command, “Enter to grow in wisdom.” It commissions those exiting to “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” What advice could be more sorely needed in an era of unprecedented political divisiveness, increasing economic challenges, and environmental threats that put at stake the human experiment itself? If the legacy of the Class of 2015 is a culture of service informed by Harvard’s wisdom, the graduates will have done well indeed. Congratulations and good luck to the Class of 2015!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Polonius tells Laertes, “This above all: to thine own self be true,” he voices what has since become among the most repeated, and arguably most hackneyed, pieces of life advice ever. Given the rest of his speech, this is pretty much as it should be. “To thine own self be true” follows a random string of platitudes along the lines of “look before you leap,” “walk softly but carry a big stick,” and “clothes make the man,” which makes it natural to wonder how seriously we’re supposed to take it. In fact, it’s an interesting philosophical question whether the whole idea behind it is bullshit.
Now, I should stress that I’m using “bullshit” in a technical, academic sense, as formulated by the distinguished moral philosopher Harry Frankfurt. For Frankfurt, the essence of bullshit—as distinct from lying—is a lack of concern for truth. “Both in lying and telling the truth,” he writes, “people are guided by their beliefs concerning the way things are. These guide them as they endeavor either to describe the world correctly or to describe it deceitfully.” But “for the bullshitter … all these bets are off. His eye is not on the facts at all, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.” Thus, Polonius certainly isn’t not trying to deceive Laertes in advising him to “give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,” but he can’t be speaking from experience or conviction either. More likely, he’s just saying this because it’s the sort of thing he imagines a good father would say under the circumstances. If so, he is bullshitting.
So, in order for “being true to yourself” to not be an exercise in bullshit in Frankfurt’s sense, it has to be something that can be guided by beliefs about what you are like. Unfortunately, it’s not clear how it can be. In considering this problem, the writer Hazel Cills quotes My So-Called Life’s Angela Chase, who puts it perfectly: “people always say how you should be yourself, like your ‘self’ is this definite thing, like a toaster or something. Like you can know what it is, even.” In my opinion, Angela has a point. One of the most important differences between your toaster and your inner self is that the former, but not the latter, exists independently of your judgments about it. Looking at a toaster normally doesn’t do anything to it, but the self is more elusive: reflecting on who you really are, or what really matters, can itself change these things. In fact, as Hamlet’s case illustrates, too much self-reflection can be destabilizing: it can leave you confused and ambivalent, with less of a clear and distinct self to be true to.
But Polonius’s injunction doesn’t have to be interpreted this way. Instead, and more interestingly, it can be interpreted as about love. “You are what you love” is a cliché in its own right, but it’s true anyway, from which it follows that to be true to what you love is to be true to yourself. Being true to what you love, however, involves a fundamentally different mode of attention from self-reflection. Specifically, it involves attending to the kind of beauty specific to the beloved object.
Explaining this idea, the philosopher Alexander Nehamas writes that “it is impossible for us to find our friends ugly.” His point is not that we tend to idealize our friends, but that we see their qualities in a different light once we see them as symbols or manifestations of our friends’ personalities. I think something close to this pertains to any object of love whatsoever: it’s impossible to love math, or basketball, or suburban Indiana without seeing these things as possessed of very particular sorts of beauty. But seeing something as beautiful in this sense is inextricably linked to aspiring, in various ways, to be true to it: to understand the complex nature of its appeal, to meet whatever standards it seems to set for you, to preserve and deepen your connection to it. For example, if you play basketball for the beauty of the game, you’ll probably want to play well for its own sake, rather than just to win, and you may take a broader interest in how other people play and in the practices surrounding the sport.
All this is to say that when you hear Polonius’s advice—and at a college commencement, I don’t see how you couldn’t—don’t think about yourself. Think about what you love, and what’s beautiful about it. Since these things are very individual matters, it doesn’t follow (contra Polonius) that if you attend to them assiduously and unselfconsciously, you’ll thereby be true to any man. But it does follow, “as the night the day,” that you’ll be true in what might be the most important way a person can be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of many special things about Harvard is that its students come from all fifty states and every region on earth. It’s part of what makes our time in Cambridge so unique and enriching.
But something happens to this diverse group over four years. While students enter from all over the country and the world, only about one quarter return to their home state. After Commencement, nearly two-thirds of Harvard graduates move to just four places: New York City, Washington, DC, Boston or California. These are all nice locations, of course, filled with exciting opportunities and interesting things to do. I’ve spent a lot of time in each place. But if you’re still looking for a way to make an impact, consider another option: go home.
Last year, after more than a decade in Cambridge, Washington, DC, and traveling to 47 states and seven countries with Barack Obama, I ran for state senate from my hometown in western Massachusetts. I was in my last semester at Harvard Law School and a tutor in Kirkland House. I was on my way to a top law firm and a very comfortable salary. But my wife, daughter and I put that aside and moved back to my childhood home ninety miles west to jump into a political campaign as a long shot candidate in a crowded primary.
The campaign was an adventure, to say the least. My wife and I cold-called thousands of voters and knocked on thousands of doors. I spent countless hours trying to win over city councilors, county officials, and Democratic committee chairs. I can confidently predict that I’ve attended more pancake breakfasts, pasta nights, ice cream socials, and neighborhood picnics than anyone else in my Harvard class. Although I’m now the youngest member of the Massachusetts Senate, I spent a lot of time at retirement communities: two-thirds of my district’s voters are over fifty.
I had never run for public office before. When I started, I had no campaign organization, no name identification, and faced opponents who had spent decades in the local political system. The region where I’m from is a wonderful place to grow up, but has struggled to keep pace with the red-hot economies in other parts of Massachusetts. What I lacked in longevity I tried to make up for with enthusiasm, a commitment to look at things differently, and a belief that what I learned at the White House and Harvard could be useful at home. Many were eager for a fresh perspective. Others were skeptical. I won by 192 votes.
Now, I have the chance to work every day helping the community where I grew up. The work is not glamorous, but it makes a tangible difference in peoples’ lives: a new program to lower the cost of a life-saving anti-overdose drug, for example, or a pilot program to train workers for careers in precision manufacturing. I put my Harvard education to work each day in the same places where I went trick-or-treating, played catch, learned to drive, and went fishing with my Dad.
You don’t have to work in politics to make a difference in your hometown. If your passion is starting a business, think about doing it where you grew up. You’ll have a built-in customer base (your family and high school friends will be loyal even if your idea is less than perfect). And it will probably be cheaper to get started, too. If you want to work in medicine, having personal knowledge of a community’s needs and history will make you a better clinician and a more thoughtful researcher. If journalism is your calling, your local paper is probably very eager for talented writers and fearless reporters. If you want to act, dance, sing, paint or sculpt, local arts and culture scenes are often the quickest ways to get noticed. People and businesses outside of Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and New York City need talented lawyers, bankers, app designers, professors, accountants, marketers, brokers, programmers and management consultants, too.
Harvard is a place that rewards ambition and exploration. From our first days on campus, we’re encouraged to act boldly, think globally, and travel far. Those are worthwhile traits, and we should hold onto them. And for some of us the boldest and bravest way to have an impact is to go where we are needed most: home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When members of environmental activist group Divest Harvard lifted their six-day “Heat Week” blockade of Massachusetts Hall on April 18, they had progressed little in convincing University President Drew G. Faust to enter into formal negotiations regarding Harvard’s investments in fossil fuels.
Faust’s stance against divesting Harvard’s $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels has remained steadfast in the face of numerous sit-ins and demonstrations by students, alumni, and faculty affiliated with the activist group.
“The funds in the endowment have been given to us by generous benefactors over many years to advance academic aims, not to serve other purposes, however worthy,” Faust wrote in a 2013 letter on divestment that remains the University’s official position. “The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
Faust highlights the Harvard University Center for Environment, which convenes 225 faculty and about 40 graduate students across the University to share and conduct research, as evidence of the University’s academic commitment to addressing climate change. Moreover, administrators and professors point to the more than 260 courses offered on energy, sustainability, and the environment, and the environmental research being done across the University—on sustainable cities at the Graduate School of Design, on the business cost of climate destabilization at Harvard Business School, on environmental law, health and policy—as exemplifying the University’s interdisciplinary dedication to both the policy and science side of environmental challenges.
Yet various faculty members and students at Harvard diverge on their assessments of the size, scope, and effectiveness of Harvard’s research on specifically climate change, and for some, the battle over divestment remains at the forefront of the issue.
PAYING THE PRICE 
Part of what may lead to divergent views of University programs are the difficulties and ambiguities in quantifying Harvard’s academic and financial commitment to climate change.
Vice Provost of Research Richard McCullough, who oversees research at the University at large, emphasized that energy and environmental research is one of his top two priorities, but said decentralized accounting across the University made estimating total research expenditures in this area difficult. McCullough said one of the offices he oversees estimated that $71 million in research grants were awarded to energy and environment research since 2009, but noted that the actual number would probably be higher since only grant titles, and not more detailed descriptions of work, are used to categorize the subject of research. The University’s annual research expenditures in 2014 totaled $851 million, according to McCullough.
How one defines research and education related to climate change also makes a big difference: For Divest Harvard member and Applied Physics graduate student Benjamin Franta, much of the work being done by faculty affiliated with HUCE is only tangentially related to addressing climate change.
“If they’re going to only limit themselves to that far-off, very uncertain, not timely research that’s needed for a very timely problem they should say, ‘We’re not working to solve climate change,’” he said. “We don’t have a very long clock on this particular problem.”
David W. Keith, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a signatory of an open letter to Faust urging divestment, also argued that by his count, there are only a handful of courses about the policy and technology of emissions reductions “central” to solving the climate change problem.
But for McCullough and Environmental Science and Engineering professor Steven C. Wofsy, who sits on HUCE’s steering committee, climate change, energy, environment, and sustainability are fundamentally inseparable topics, suggesting that the University’s numbers are not only accurate but may even be underestimates.
Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Zhiming Kuang, for one, “thinks a lot about tropical convection—you say, is that really climate?” said Wofsy, giving an example of how it is sometimes difficult to immediately identify research related to climate change. “Well, yeah, tropical convection is the firebox that drives the atmosphere…if you don’t understand how big thunderstorms work, you can’t make meaningful models of it.”
Wofsy said that though Harvard is perhaps not engineering immediate solutions to climate change, the University’s professors and students are conducting environmental research that would shape policy in 10 years and beyond.
“There are some people that tell you about climate change, and that’s what it’s going to be, and then there are others that are actually trying to understand what happens…and you have to understand it to mitigate it,” McCullough added.
Whatever the absolute size of Harvard’s commitment to climate change research may be, increased attention without a doubt has been given to the environmental sciences in general in recent years. Wofsy said Environmental Science and Engineering has seen three faculty appointments this year, what he said was a significant increase for an area that has only 10 core faculty in SEAS. The department also expects an average of 30 concentrators every year, about six times the number it had just five or six years ago.
McCullough also pointed to the University’s new $20 million Climate Change Solutions Fund, which awarded roughly $800,000 to seven research teams this year, as evidence that environmental research is a top capital campaign priority for his office and for Faust.
BRIDGING THE GAP
Professors and administrators such as Wofsy argue that Harvard is uniquely prepared to meet the climate change issue with an interdisciplinary solution uniting policy and science, but for others, Harvard’s historically decentralized structure raises questions about its ability to connect researchers from across the University.
“I think we need to strengthen the link between SEAS and the Kennedy School,” said Keith, who holds a joint appointment at both schools. “We don’t have enough connection between people who are cutting-edge at the relevant science and tech and industry that’s actually developing solutions, nor with those people and policy people who understand [the] world of politics.” Keith said Harvard should prioritize hiring faculty with expertise in multiple facets of the energy and environment debate to bridge the gap.
For some, HUCE is already bridging that gap. The center’s managing director, James I. Clem, described its role as “convening and coordinating” researchers from different schools in an effort to bring Faust’s spirit of “One Harvard” to the environmental space.
“We want to make sure that the people making breakthroughs in renewable technology are in touch with the people at the Business School, at the i-lab, with the policy people at the Kennedy School, that that collaboration is happening,” he said.
Clem, though, also acknowledged that Harvard’s decentralization might lead to schools being “preoccupied with what they’re doing” and not “necessarily connected to the other parts of campus.”
McCullough, who views his role as “matchmaking” researchers across the University, points to the fact that Harvard recently received two large Energy Frontier Research Center grants from the U.S. Department of Energy—one worth $12 million—in a year when many institutions lost theirs as evidence that research efforts have begun to transcend decentralization.
“You can’t win them unless you have people marching in lockstep—it’s not a fake collaboration,” McCullough said. “When leaders at the University stand up and say, ‘Energy and environment, climate change solutions [are] important,’ it has a tremendous impact on the University….People tend to rally around these issues.”
IN THE BELTWAY
Some are also concerned that even if the University’s research efforts are able to produce the breakthrough policies and technologies needed to address climate change, political realities in Washington and around the world—which in some respects are working directly opposite sustainability research—will stall their implementation and further developments.
“The speed at which technology is developing is adequate to keep up with climate change, but they have to be incorporated immediately after they develop,” Chemistry professor James Anderson said. “Congress right now is trying to eliminate research on climate problems—this is really a serious breakdown in the governance of this country.”
Wofsy pointed to the capital-intensive nature of energy infrastructure as a reason it is difficult for businesses and governments to rapidly incorporate developing technologies.
And further climate research could stall as most institutions are experiencing 8 to 12 percent decrease in federal funding for scientific research, according to McCullough. Though Harvard has been relatively less affected by this trend, receiving 3 to 5 percent less funding from Washington than past years, researchers say they can already feel the impact.
Chemistry professor Roy G. Gordon ’61 said seed funding from Harvard for research projects would be critical going forward in producing the results needed to land larger federal grants. An ongoing battery storage research project that Gordon leads, for example, was recently able to obtain funding from the Department of Energy after SEAS seed funding allowed it to generate some preliminary results.
But for Franta, slow adoption of research findings by change-averse political and business circles is a reason for why laboratory work alone is not enough to address climate change.
“I’m not trying to bash teaching and research—I think they’re incredibly important...but I think we just simply need to be honest with ourselves,” Franta said. “If we really want to solve this problem in the time frame that we have available, we need to be honest about what is actually going to make a big difference in that time.”
A RESEARCH INSTITUTION
Some, however, view climate change as a fundamentally long-term problem to which the University can best contribute as a research institution alone. Business School professor Rebecca M. Henderson credited research with informing society of the dangers of climate change and subsequently uncovering potential mechanisms to address them.
“It’s an incredibly difficult collective action problem, and without the work of the scientists who brought it to our attention we wouldn’t even be talking about it,” Henderson said. “I think not to do research is to shoot our eyes out.”
McCullough similarly maintains that research is the University’s most appropriate response to climate change.
“We’re focusing on the problem in exactly the way that universities should focus on the problem,” McCullough said. “[And] we’re talking about the planet, it’s just not something that we can pull the string and all of a sudden there’s no climate change—it’s a really complicated and long-term issue, something we’re going to live with for a while.”
But for Franta, a little hope at least lies in his perception that research will inevitably propel the University to take that final step towards divestment and match its commitment to a sustainable campus and research with action.
“The irony is that the more they scale up their teaching and research, the more people are going to want things like divestment,” Franta reflected. “The more people are educated about climate change, the more they’re worried about it, the more they’re interested in trying new things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conventional wisdom would call my undergraduate graduation a train wreck—even without the commencement speaker who was drunk and angry. Most of my classmates were heading to fancy graduate schools or Wall Street jobs. Even the slackers had something lined up back home.
Me? Summer school teaching had convinced me to abandon my teaching plans and work at Yale for a year, but a few weeks before graduation the provost revoked the job offer so he could give my position to someone well-connected.
I had no job, no money and no plan. Moreover, I was engaged to a classmate, my best friend, who also had no money, no job, and no plan.
By most measures my next two years were a string of professional failures. I answered mail for a senator who promptly retired; the promised promotion never came. I evaluated demonstration programs for two nonprofits that quickly ran out of grant money. I dropped out of an evening graduate school program to run a presidential primary campaign—for a boom-and-bust candidate.
I was having a great time and learning a lot, but I felt I needed a “plan” and headed to Harvard for law school, where after three grim years I extended that grimness by working for a large Boston law firm. Eight months later, when my earlier “failures” unexpectedly led to an offer of a senior job in Washington at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, I grabbed it even though everyone except my wife told me that I was ruining my life by not sticking to “the plan.”
Over the next eight years I had the opportunity to do things I never dreamed possible. At the White House I wrote the first 25th Amendment operations plan for the disability of the President. At HHS I co-wrote the first United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval plan, a plan which by now has benefited tens of millions of desperate patients. I successfully tried the first federal human immunodeficiency virus discrimination enforcement case.
As I was leaving the federal government, major law firms were savaging the plans of my classmates in unprecedented numbers. Many of them never recovered.
I learned that mission matters. People who pursue their passions rarely lead lives they regret.
I also learned that the workday does not need to be what defines you as a person; an education in the arts or humanities need not be forgotten because you are supporting yourself. If you can stave off the demands of social media, gaming and bad television, you can write top-notch poetry or music at home. You can paint. You can preserve the history of one of your communities.
Your life should dictate your education—your education should never dictate your life, and your education does not need to stop just because you are no longer sending checks to Harvard. There has never been a better time in history to be an independent scholar. The books and articles you need for scholarship are increasingly available on the Internet; one no anymore needs an academic affiliation to engage in world-class scholarship.
These days most happy people have reinvented themselves—out of either necessity or changed ambitions—many times. Your most likely source of regret will be a pragmatic decision not to have chased an opportunity whose uncertainties frightened you.
Many of your classmates set long-term plans as teenagers, and for some of them their plan is a reasonable map for pursuit of their passions. Many more of them have a plan that reflects the expectations of parents, classmates and others, and they will almost surely find that those plans will stifle their opportunities.
There are no SAT tests in life. Be passionate about what you do, and if your first try doesn’t work, do not be afraid to reinvent yourself and be passionate about the second or third try. Remember how precious your time is, and use it as if it is running out (which it is).
Plan or no plan, find the people and the missions you can love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2012, Harvard and MIT announced a collaboration that changed the virtual education landscape: edX, an online platform intended to make course material from the two schools available for free to a global audience.
The founders shared a threefold mission—to expand access to education, improve teaching and learning on their campuses and online, and research the effects of their initiatives in order to improve teaching and learning. Today, the platform has partnered with more than 50 colleges and universities but remains governed by its co-founders, Harvard and MIT. But in the years since the schools introduced edX to the world, the platform has manifested itself on the two Cambridge campuses uniquely.
More than 83 percent of undergraduates at MIT have used the school’s Residential MITx system— a learning management system adapted, but separate, from edX—for a “substantial” portion of the work in one or more of their courses, according to MITx’s website and faculty involved in the program. Beyond that system, professors at MIT often harvest assignments and data from their Massive Online Open Courses they create on the platform and readapt them for their on-campus classes.
While Harvard groups have made substantive efforts to introduce HarvardX into courses across the University, the platform has not had as much of a widespread presence on this campus as it has on MIT’s.
“Harvard and MIT have made efforts to translate the work they're doing at HarvardX and MITx to the residential experience, and MIT has really made some substantial strides along that regard,” said Justin Reich, a HarvardX researcher and MIT lecturer who has authored and co-authored numerous reports about edX.
“I think Harvard is doing some interesting things, but I think they’re definitely still in the pilot phase,” Reich added, “and they're having less of a systematic effect across” the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
A HEAD START
In the fall of 2012, Harvard and MIT jointly rolled out several courses under their new platform edX, amidst widespread media excitement over the “tsunami” of MOOCs that were predicted to revolutionize the nature of education.
But online course material was nothing new for MIT. A decade earlier, the school had launched OpenCourseware, an initiative aimed at placing all content from MIT’s courses online and available to the world.
On the other hand, edX was Harvard’s first major experiment with MOOCs. And it did not roll out without controversy: A year after the announcement of the creation of edX, 58 Harvard faculty members signed an open letter calling for faculty oversight on the platform and raising concerns about it overall.
“It is our responsibility to ensure that HarvardX is consistent with our commitment to our students on campus, and with our academic mission,” the letter read. “Given the rapid pace of development of HarvardX, we believe it is essential to have a formal, sustained, and structured faculty discussion on these issues as soon as possible.”
To the knowledge of MIT faculty members interviewed, faculty raised no such public concern at MIT, although some MIT professors acknowledge that other faculty members were initially skeptical about the MOOC aspect of edX.
Some faculty and administrators from both Harvard and MIT say that MIT’s history with online course material resulted in the school’s easier transition to edX, while the new initiative spurred more public backlash from Harvard faculty.
“With OpenCourseWare there was this major push for MIT faculty to put all of their material online in the OpenCourseWare structure,” said Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX. “I think for their faculty it was less a transition in mindsets.”
MIT faculty members agree, suggesting that a culture of online courseware had already been well-established on MIT’s campus by the time the school introduced edX with Harvard.
“The transition over to MITx was facilitated with our experience with OCW,” said Saif Rayyan, lecturer and researcher of online education at MIT. “I found myself, as well as other faculty, naturally transitioning over to MITx.”
ON CAMPUS
That initial hesitation on the part of the Harvard faculty, and the more open arms of MIT professors, might have served to accelerate MIT’s adoption of the platform that the two schools jointly engineered.
“I think it depends on the department and how quickly people buy into it,” said Mary Ellen Wiltrout, a curriculum development specialist for the Biology department at MIT. For most professors at MIT, she said, reception was “positive.”
Students and faculty from MIT say that MITx has become an expected—and almost unavoidable—part of the school’s curriculum, since it acts as part of the school’s learning management system and because faculty members often integrate aspects of their MOOCs into their residential courses. Just up the river, HarvardX has not been incorporated into students’ curriculum and has not taken hold to the same degree despite administrative initiatives, according to some faculty members and researchers.
Faculty from MIT and Harvard point to MIT’s history of experimentation with online resources as a reason for the school’s success in incorporating the platform into students’ curriculum.
“Once that culture was in place all online courses are just an extension of that,” said Chris Terman, a computer science professor at MIT. “It’s just taking OCW material and saying, ‘Well, let’s give students a chance to help them interact with the material and present it with them, as opposed to just posting it online.’”
The school’s Residential MIT program uses the Open edX platform to mount course websites as a version of a learning management system. Harvard, on the other hand, uses iSites and Canvas as its learning management systems for course websites.
According to Isaac Chuang, senior associate director of digital learning at MIT, the learning management system also makes it easier for professors to reappropriate MOOC content they have created into their on-campus classrooms.
“One of the benefits that we have is the ability to quickly turn around whatever we put up in MOOC form and readapt that content on campus,” said Chuang, adding that faculty members often reuse psets, videos, and assignments from their MOOC courses for their online courses.
“It’s definitely very prominent,” said MIT student Drew Bent of the platform’s presence on campus. He later added, “I can't think of any instance where you wouldn't interface with it at some point.”
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said Harvard is exploring integrating HarvardX more systematically as does MIT. “MIT has had an explicit goal to have more of its undergraduates interact with the platform, and they followed a strategy that allowed that to happen,” Smith said.
TOP DOWN AND BOTTOM UP
Both universities have invested millions of dollars into new strategies to improve teaching and learning and have used edX as a means by which to do so. But the two schools have implemented different methods for managing their own offshoots of edX in order to reflect the differences in their faculty’s experiences with online education and their distinct curricula.
In 2013, MIT created an Office of Digital Learning specifically focused on rethinking education in “the digital age.” That same year, Harvard introduced its Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, which is headed by East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Peter K. Bol and oversees HarvardX and the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, a presidential initiative launched in October 2011.
Since its inception, HarvardX has employed a central team of 48 full-time and seven part-time researchers, instructional development staff, and production management employees. They work on the fourth floor of 125 Mt. Auburn St. in a space self-dubbed “Hx HQ,” where teams edit video clips, write plans on the whiteboard walls, and produce courses for a faculty without a long history of online teaching.
Additionally, while HarvardX affiliates describe the course creation process for the platform as “grassroots” and “bottom up,” since faculty often approach Lue or Bol first to propose a course, the HarvardX affiliates work with these faculty each step of the way to ensure their course will be successful.
Down Massachusetts Avenue, MIT runs its MITx course proposal process and instructional support services through its Office of Digital Learning. The central staff is smaller at MIT than it is at Harvard, instructors receive support when they request it, and individual departments are instrumental in planning courses.
According to Wiltrout, most conversations that determine course content happen not through the Office of Digital Learning, but within individual departments. But at Harvard, the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning takes on a more involved role.
“We're more centralized at Harvardx,” Reich said. “We have a floor full of course developers and video editors...MIT has a more distributive model of course development, so they send resources out to professors groups and the faculty build the course with support but without the same degree of centralized support.”
COURSE DIFFERENCES
Even beyond its history with online education and its professors’ acceptance of the program, some faculty members say that MIT’s focus on science and technology has further made transferring in-class materials to the platform easier.
“I think that, in general, MIT courses lend themselves to easier online implementations because of their science and math focus,” said Zhongzhou Chen, MITx postdoctoral fellow and educational researcher. “We still haven’t reached the stage when we can easily have computers grade English essays, but through algorithms we are developing, we’re trying to reduce that gap.”
Lue agreed that MIT’s educational focus may have better facilitated edX’s introduction onto its campus, while it may have been more difficult for faculty in Harvard’s many humanities and social sciences departments to think about an online version of their course.
“It’s also worth noting, besides the open courseware issue, that MIT is primarily an engineering school,” Lue said. “I think with Harvard it was much more unusual to think about these things in the context of the humanities and the social sciences.”
The edX platform is integrated into many of MIT’s “General Institute Requirements,” MIT’s set of distribution requirements, which often include first-year and introductory courses, according to MIT faculty.
For MIT faculty, transitioning between their MOOCs and on-campus courses is made easier by the school’s use of Open edX as its learning management system. But Bol, Harvard’s vice provost for advances in learning, said Harvard is currently working on creating a means to use HarvardX internally only for Harvard, just as MIT does with its Residential MITx system. That system is expected to be available in the fall, Bol said.
Still, the degree to which the platform has been integrated into the traditional education at MIT leaves some students there questioning the compatibility of online learning in the campus setting.
Andre Aboulian, a junior at MIT, recounted his experience taking one specific MITx math course, saying that “students just try to get through [the course material] as quickly, so instead of those exercises being an hour of quality comprehension, it was about two minutes of students just clicking through random answers—this became very ineffective very quickly.”
Echoing the concerns raised on-and-off-again by various Harvard faculty members, Aboulian questioned the value of edX for the traditional students of the two institutions that founded the platform almost three years ago.
“A lot of people question why they are paying money to come to a university to take courses online,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many Harvard professors, a sabbatical provides is an opportunity to delve deeper into a research topic of interest, travel outside of Cambridge, produce a book or a substantial written work, or even conduct a transition in an academic career.
English professor Elisa New, however, spent the the past year on sabbatical solely focused on developing an online, modularized version of her on-campus course. She aimed to bring Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 12: “Poetry in America” to HarvardX, the University’s branch of virtual learning platform edX.
According to New, who had begun the development process a year prior to her sabbatical, the effort required to deliver her course’s brick-and-mortar experience to an open, online classroom demanded her full attention.
“I’m working my brains off during this sabbatical,” New said. “I took two semesters [off] at half pay, and I work harder for half pay than I work for full pay…I’ve been working harder in the last few years than I ever remember working.”
New’s decision to take leave deviates from the path of other Harvard professors who have also volunteered to create online courses. For his part, classical Greek literature professor Gregory Nagy said at the time that he added 25 hours per week to his teaching and research workload and received no additional compensation when he produced CB22x: “The Ancient Greek Hero” in the spring of 2013.
Since its founding by Harvard and MIT in 2012, edX has expanded to include 39 university charter members and to host more than 500 courses on its platform. But what has remained constant is that by and large, Harvard faculty members do not receive monetary compensation from HarvardX, although some receive varying levels of support from their individual schools.
Concerns about the discrepancy between the work necessary to create a HarvardX course and an associated form of compensation, or lack thereof, have led professors to question the long-term sustainability of Harvard faculty participation in virtual course development.
AN UNDERESTIMATED EFFORT
History of Science professor Peter L. Galison, who spearheaded the HarvardX course based on Science of the Physical Universe 17: “The Einstein Revolution,” said he underestimated the endeavor of planning, developing, and publishing a HarvardX course, a reality commonly acknowledged among HarvardX professors.
“The course took a couple of years to make,” Galison said. “It was much more work than I thought it would be. It’s really two years of work, a huge amount of advance work that had to be done.”
According to History professor William C. Kirby, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and one of the instructors for “ChinaX,” launching a HarvardX class can place additional burdens on a faculty member’s workload, especially considering that development frequently occurs in tandem with on-campus teaching and research responsibilities that HarvardX faculty maintain.
“The time it takes to start a new online course was in our experience the equivalence of at least the time it would take to launch two altogether new courses in the College,” Kirby wrote in an email.
Some HarvardX professors doubt that these efforts are worthwhile when only about 5 percent of registrants who do not pay a fee for ID verification complete their online course, a reported rate based on two years of edX course data.
“If you asked me, would I do it another year, if it took the same amount of time for the same amount of student impact, I think the answer is likely to be no,” said Kennedy School of Government professor Graham T. Allison ’62, who also instructs HarvardX course “Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press.”
NOT ABOUT THE MONEY
At the same time, the usually unpaid effort to create a HarvardX course has not deterred some faculty members from eagerly taking up the endeavor, which involves submitting a competitive proposal to HarvardX that details the scope of their course, logistics, and research objectives.
HarvardX professors did agree that they did not pursue the online course development process for financial benefits. Rather, they considered the opportunity to enhance their on-campus classroom experience via elements created for the online courses a top priority.
In Astronomy professor Dimitar Sasselov’s course, SPU30: “Life as a Planetary Phenomenon,” students utilize materials from his HarvardX course, “Super-Earths And Life,” in homework assignments, so more classroom time is devoted to discussion and interactive engagement, rather than the traditional lecture format.
“My opinion is anything we do as faculty should first and foremost take care of students in residence,” Sasselov said. “The time I spent developing my HarvardX course is used to improve my residential course.”
Expanding beyond a localized University impact, some HarvardX professors said providing educational resources at no cost to those interested prompted their involvement. Sasselov added that the creation of a free, online course can be compared to writing a magazine article targeted at the general public, a common form of outreach for scientists, because neither generate revenue but both represent meaningful investments of a public intellectual’s time.
Nagy echoed Sasselov’s sentiment, emphasizing an aim to “get the word out” about classical Greek literature.
“I want to put my non-money where my mouth is… I’m just passionately interested in education not becoming stratospherically expensive, and something that the only the elites can have,” Nagy said.
The number and diversity of students enrolling in HarvardX courses—more than 2.7 million students had registered in 195 countries as of May 2015—have also proved attractive to professors.
Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilization Peter K. Bol, who also leads the office that oversees HarvardX, instructs “ChinaX” and said the 40,000 of his online registrants represents a number far greater than that he could ever teach in person over his lifetime.
WORK IN PROGRESS
With Harvard faculty members putting in considerable time and energy into creating online content, they have raised the question of whether they should receive payment for their work.
Bol said individual schools over HarvardX have the choice to additionally compensate their professors who instruct on the virtual platform.
“We [HarvardX] would bust the bank if we were to try to take responsibility for compensating faculty,” Bol said. “What we’ve said is that it’s up to the schools to compensate faculty.”
At the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, professors who teach on HarvardX currently do not receive any form of compensation. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said the school will have a “more explicit compensation model” after he discusses with faculty “our strategic vision now that we've had some experience in this space.”
The compensation model varies at other schools within the University. For Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health with a HarvardX course on global health, he said his teaching load was reduced by a half course by the school as compensation.
Similarly, Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Richard Elmore said he developed and taught his HarvardX course “Leaders of Learning” as part of an agreement that it would be part of his course load.
Elmore added that he raised the issue of compensation when asked to develop a second version of the course and was told that HarvardX would support production and research assistance but not faculty compensation.
“I understand that the HarvardX business model is still a work in progress, but when faculty put considerable effort and creativity into the design of courses, it seems exceedingly odd to have no arrangement whatsoever to compensate faculty, other than released time from regular teaching,” Elmore wrote in an email.
Many professors said the current “volunteering” model—where HarvardX relies on individual initiative of faculty members to develop courses—is not sustainable.
“The organization can't seem to figure out how to acknowledge the faculty's intellectual property other than by reductions in teaching loads,” Elmore wrote in an email. “I don't think this model would generate a passing grade in entrepreneurship 101 at [Harvard Business School]."
Debate and uncertainty over virtual education compensation models goes beyond Harvard’s gates, with edX partner institutions varying in their approach. According to Guy M. Rogers, a Wellesley professor who teaches an edX course on Alexander the Great, Wellesley College gives faculty members nonmonetary forms of compensation, such as a reduced course load.
At Cornell, each department receives a grant to support professors instructing online courses with teaching assistants and reduced administrative responsibilities, according to Cornell professors Marianne E. Krasny and Andrew Chignell.
Still, professors at the University of Texas at Austin and Colgate say they have yet to receive any form of compensation and are unsure of whether they will. Indeed, at UT Austin, the faculty and the university have been negotiating a contract for the past two and half years on potential sharing of revenues generated by online courses, according to UT Austin Computer Science lecturer Maggie Myers.
“It’s definitely at an experimental stage, and we should expect lots of missteps and chaos and confusion,” said Michael P. Starbird, a UT Austin professor teaching an edX mathematics course. “Nobody yet knows what the right models are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a national discussion about the decline of liberal arts education, Harvard College has seen a drop in concentrators in the arts and humanities. Just 14 percent of undergraduates concentrated in the field during the 2013-14 academic year, down from 22 percent a decade ago.
But at the same time, more than a year into the public phase of Harvard’s $6.5 billion capital campaign, University President Drew G. Faust has endeavored on an unprecedented and extensive campaign to fundraise for the arts and humanities. From bringing representatives from the movie industry to campus to publicly praising the University’s work in the field, Faust has made the humanities a centerpiece of Harvard’s messaging during its record-seeking fundraising drive.
“We’ve always tried to raise some money for the arts in the past, but not with the kind of emphasis or the high level priority or the presence with which the President or [Arts and Humanities Dean] Diana Sorensen has spoken about how it enriches our environment,” said Michael D. Smith, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
And while universities across the nation experience a crisis in the humanities, Harvard has set forth on its first major campaign for the arts, extolling recent initiatives to expand their presence on campus. Administrators have seized the opportunity of the Harvard Campaign to craft a network of alumni donors and reframe how they represent the arts and humanities in their messaging.
“Crisis is an opportunity,” English professor Martin Puchner said.
THE DONORS
A crucial component of fundraising for the arts and humanities is identifying key benefactors who recognize the value of a liberal arts education, administrators say, and part of Harvard’s strategy has been to build and capitalize on extensive alumni networks. That can take some finessing.
Faust said arts and humanities fundraising targets “people of every walk of life for whom the experience of doing things in the humanities here is and has remained central in their lives.”
Fundraising for the new undergraduate concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media presents a special challenge, said Puchner, who spearheaded the program’s design. Launching for the first time this coming fall, Theater, Dance, and Media lacks the advantage of a preexisting alumni network from which to pull potential donors, unlike more established sectors of the sciences and humanities. Harvard hopes to raise $20 million for the concentration, according to Smith.
Puchner said he has found that he has been able to develop a network of potential donors comprised of alumni who were involved in extracurricular theater during their time at Harvard, many of whom he said have expressed that they wished such a concentration existed when they were students.
“We’re conscripting them as ex post facto alumni, in a way,” Puchner said.
In addition to alumni networks, geographic targeting is a key element of arts and humanities fundraising. Sorensen said reaching out to potential donors in “key cities”—such as New York and London, where there is a strong culture of the arts—will allow for “building the momentum we haven’t always had.”
The strategy, said Sorensen, is “a concerted effort to identify potential donors and building a group.”
THE MESSAGE
Once donors have been reached, administrators and professors must carefully craft a message in the greater context of a national struggle for the arts and humanities.
“You do not get people to invest in you if your only message is ‘We are the downtrodden, we are neglected, we are not given the place at the table that we deserve to be given,’” said Homi K. Bhabha, the director of the Mahindra Humanities Center. “Those things are true, but the way you change those things is show people what the humanities can do, not that the humanities are in danger.”
For administrators, showing what the humanities can do involves new developments and reframing what is already on campus. They are quick to point to the concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media as an initiative that presents a new commitment to integrate arts into undergraduate education. Donor funding would be used, for instance, to support new faculty positions, visiting artist lecturers, and the new concentration-led performances, according to Smith.
“The hope is that it is easier to get support for something that is already starting, where you can point to initiatives, students, programs, courses, than a hypothetical thing doesn’t even exist yet,” Puchner said, adding that he hopes that the concentration’s roll out will increase support for the program beyond the $5 million in seed funding from Faust’s office.
“At a time when we are losing students, I think it’s a good idea for morale,” Puchner said.
THE CAMPUS
Alongside discussions with donors about new teaching programs, administrators have brought the conversation of spaces into their push to pitch the arts and humanities—even if new construction is not physically underway.
Seeing areas of Harvard’s campus as “corridors” as concentrations of work in the humanities is an effective way to increase the presence of arts and humanities for donors to target, according to Sorensen. Just Quincy Street, for example, includes a number of Harvard buildings that serve the humanities, such as the Sackler Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, and the Barker Center. An area of Brattle Street includes the American Repertory Theatre, venues in Radcliffe Yard, and the Dance Center.
“We may not have a huge new building, but we can frame the spaces we have,” Sorensen said.
Faculty members have also expressed interest in including arts and humanities spaces in the development of a campus in Allston in coming years, which Sorensen said could be framed as another such area.
Other ongoing initiatives are also good selling points for Harvard administrators looking to court donors for the field. While the arts events throughout the year are not directly connected to the capital campaign, for example, they raise the profile of the arts and humanities at Harvard for those on campus and off, according to Faust.
These strategies, from new undergraduate commitments to a new looks at old spaces to looks at future spaces, combine to present the humanities’ revitalization, Bhabha said.
“I think the important thing is to show how the humanities are a crossroads of the campus,” he said, “and that’s the way you actually get people to invest in you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They come to Harvard as new Ph.D.s, as researchers paid to teach but who hope to use Harvard’s resources to advance their academic careers. They come as curators and administrators, scientists and artists, but work extra jobs on the side. They come as spouses, seeking academic work while relocating for a partner who received a faculty position here.
For Harvard’s non-ladder faculty, rarely is there a single or obvious path into the University’s gates, nor is there a clear path out.
Today, there are 295 full-time non-ladder faculty—the teachers not on Harvard’s tenure track—within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, while there are 726 ladder faculty members. They can hold one of 11 formally non-ladder positions, from lectureships that can expire after just one year to what are essentially indefinite positions for some professors of the practice.
Other Harvard schools—like the Graduate School of Education and the Kennedy School of Government—use the term “adjunct” to describe the instructors that take on similar positions in their programs. And in recent months, adjunct faculties at universities both within Cambridge and across the nation have moved to unionize, garnering attention with their demands for workplace rights for part-time instructors.
FAS administrators, though, maintain that their non-ladder faculty are not adjuncts, or part-time or “contingent” instructors, and instead are unique instructors who play a vital role in teaching undergraduates and in the FAS community, even if they are hired solely to replace ladder faculty in some courses. Moreover, they have access to certain University resources and are eligible for contractual benefits that many adjunct faculties elsewhere are not.
But some groups within FAS’s non-ladder faculty closely resemble adjuncts at other universities. Their similarities may be less obvious within FAS given its broad definition of non-ladder faculty, which includes wide disparity in pay, job security, and voice within the school. Even more, some charge that administrators do not give enough attention to the issues that concern them.
“In three years that I’ve been here, I’ve never had any dean or somebody who can affect the conditions of my work or my salary or my teaching sit with me or sit with all of us and have a discussion,” said Ezer Vierba, a History and Literature lecturer.
And to Alison Denton Jones, a Social Studies lecturer, the difference in terminology is just semantics.
“It’s not a term Harvard uses because, like everything else, they have their own term for everything,” said Jones, who often referred to herself as an adjunct. Jones, who says her life at Harvard is “convenient” but often stressful, is not sure what she will do once her contract here expires, since she has not yet been able to find a permanent job at any university.
Included in a large and disparate group of non-ladder faculty within FAS, lecturers face the daily stresses of job instability, uncertainty for their futures, and a lack of career support as many aspire to remain in academia, but as ladder faculty. Theirs is a transient population that serves Harvard in its educational mission, but individual lecturers say they often feel marginalized while they are here but unprepared to leave.
THE ‘BEDROCK’
According to the 2013-2014 FAS Appointment and Promotion Handbook, there are 11 categories of non-ladder faculty within FAS, ranging from senior lecturers to the recently-created position of College fellow. In their roles as teachers, these faculty provide a vital service—one to which FAS’s ladder faculty often lack time to contribute.
Non-ladder faculty teach about 34 percent of the College’s enrollments, according to Michael D. Smith, the dean of FAS. And they are often considered better teachers than their ladder faculty counterparts.
“A lot of professors at high-ranking universities are actually poor teachers,” said Cris Cecka, a former lecturer at the new Institute for Applied Computational Science who recently left for another job in California. “I don’t think that’s anything new. That’s been around for along time. Professor and people in academia are taught to do research and think about big ideas and not trained to teach.”
All categories of non-ladder faculty members received, on average, higher teaching evaluations on the Q Guide than full professors, according to a 2009 internal report on non-ladder faculty in FAS.
At FAS, many non-ladder faculty are hired explicitly and singularly to teach, which sets them apart from ladder faculty, who are also expected to research, advise, and do committee work. According to the 2009 report, the school uses non-ladder faculty to “deploy its resources and instructors to their best comparative advantage.” The majority of Expository Writing and language preceptors are non-ladder faculty, and concentrations like History and Literature and Social Studies rely almost wholly on part- and full-time lecturers to teach their students.
“They are the bedrock of some of our teaching programs,” History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said of non-ladder faculty members.
JOB INSECURITY
Many non-ladder faculty are brought to Harvard for one reason—to teach—but some say that it can be difficult to fulfill that responsibility as they grapple with uncertainty, often second-class to Harvard’s ladder faculty.
Non-ladder faculty members—especially lecturers on short-term fixed contracts that can last as little as one year—often teach courses when professors are on sabbatical or temporarily fill in after faculty members leave and FAS looks for full-time replacements.
As a result, their job security is almost always in flux. Non-ladder instructors’ contracts might not be renewed when ladder faculty members with similar areas of expertise are hired or return from leave. The problem is especially acute in departments with few faculty members who are not on the tenure track.

Although Jones said she has not ever been replaced by a ladder faculty member, if someone who similarly teaches on social movements were hired, she could be. And the problem is not as acute in Social Studies—where most instructors are in fact lecturers—as in other departments with more professors.
“If they should hire one of these joint track [faculty] members who teaches what I teach, then they won't need me anymore, and it won't be because of anything I did,” she said.
And while non-ladder faculty members’ contracts are often subject to the whims of students and faculty, their teaching experiences for the duration of their employment at Harvard are similarly out of their hands. Professors have priority in terms of course choices, non-ladder faculty members say. Even if a lecturer has worked on the subject, they probably will not teach that subject if a ladder faculty member has designed another course on that topic.
THE OUTSIDERS
Though Smith says that “we expect them to be members of our community,” lecturers, brought to Harvard for an uncertain measure of time, navigate life inside Harvard oftentimes without the sense of belonging that the school’s less transient members come to enjoy.
For his part, Vierba, the History and Literature lecturer, said he and his non-ladder peers feel “marginalized” because they think that ladder faculty and administrators rarely ask for their input.
Indeed, regular lecturers and preceptors—two of the formal positions FAS categorizes as non-ladder—do not have voting power at FAS’s monthly meetings, where ladder faculty and a select few others meet to discuss and change programs and policies, like General Education and sexual harassment procedures, that affect the school.
Vierba—who shares an undecorated and cramped office in the basement of the Barker Center with three other lecturers—said he feels that FAS does not ask for his and his peers’ opinions and that their scholarship often goes unnoticed. “In those ways we’re marginalized,” he said.
Smith, the FAS dean, said individual departments can include instructors in their own internal discussions. “I tell individual departments, ‘It’s entirely up to you, but I have no problem at all if you include your non-ladder important teaching faculty in departmental discussions and departmental meetings,’” Smith said. “But then it becomes very departmental specific.”
Still, within FAS, non-ladder faculty members especially feel the presence and pressures of academic hierarchies. “It’s a weird thing, having all the kind of power and responsibility of faculty without the privilege,” said Cecka, the former Institute for Applied Computational Science lecturer. “It’s something I don’t fully understand.”
And often, undergraduates do not understand those hierarchies, which can sometimes make lecturers feel uncomfortable trying to explain the difference. According to Peter Verovšek, a lecturer on Social Studies, lecturers feel the impact of their positions when students ask them to write letters of recommendation—“I unfortunately think that a letter from a lecturer or a glorified post doc just does not mean as much when students are applying to very prestigious things,” he said—and even when they receive their emails.
“There’s always the awkward moment at the beginning of the semester where students write to you and say, ‘Dear Professor Verovšek,’ and we’re not,” said Peter Verovšek said. “I think students automatically think that if someone’s teaching at Harvard they're a professor.”
“They feel like second class citizens, and that’s unfortunate,” Graduate School of Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 said. “Not all of them do, but even when they're beloved by students and faculty, they feel second class because they don’t have that name professor in front of them.”
Still, non-ladder faculty acknowledge that their situations at Harvard are generally better than other adjuncts around the nation, who often do not have access to resources like those at Harvard. “There are a lot of us who would be perfectly happy to do this indefinitely, and not have to timeout,” Jones said.
LOOKING FOR A LADDER
No matter their experiences, many non-ladder faculty members at the lower end of the pay scale do not feel they could stay in those positions forever—that is not how they are designed. Given that reality, some feel that FAS could better prepare them for the transition into new jobs, especially for careers in academia, once they end their stays here.
Lecturers, aiming for tenure track positions later in their careers, feel pressure to research; in order to be considered for those jobs, they must churn out research and publications—crucial for a potential faculty portfolio.
“We have to convert our dissertations into books, we have to write more articles,” Vierba said, “and the University acknowledges that in that we have full privileges like other faculty to use the Harvard libraries and to do research.”
But lectureships often provide little, if any, financial compensation for research or to attend conferences, whereas ladder faculty position might offer more. Vierba said he receives only $650 in research funds each year.
The issue of funding surfaces elsewhere as lecturers attempt to establish themselves in the academic community. Lecturers recount stories where conference planners expressed surprise that a lecturer from Harvard could not attend due to financial constraints.
“I found myself flying to Panama for a week between classes—Panama is where I do my research—and that does not cover the conference I have to go to,” Vierba said.
Some lecturers seek to relieve their financial constraints by taking paid positions as research assistants, functioning effectively like postdoctoral positions. Smith, meanwhile, said individuals can seek out a variety of positions that fit their academic goals, especially if they want resources to pursue research.
Smith cited the Harvard College Fellows Program as an important effort to ease the transition into a ladder faculty position. Departments seek applications for fellows with specific academic interests so they can teach in a specific academic interest with research support. About half the non-ladder faculty hires since 2009 has been through the program, he said, indicating more support for non-ladder faculty in their transition.
Still, for many non-ladder faculty members, finding time for other scholarly pursuits can be difficult when they are consumed by their teaching duties. As such, the stresses and instability of life as a non-ladder faculty member can force aspiring professors to give up on their academic careers entirely or to concede that their time at Harvard has not adequately prepared them to move forward in academia.
Indeed, non-ladder faculty members worry that a ladder position becomes more and more out of reach, as lecturers become consumed by teaching and do not have the time to research, Vierba said.
“We tend to do a lot of teaching and advising,” Verovšek said. “That’s great for students, but the problem is when you’re searching for other jobs...they’re really looking for research output.”
“The things I think that we're called to do and the things I think a lot of us enjoy doing are not, I think, the things that are then going to help us to get a permanent position necessarily later,” he added.
Jones said that after her contract with Social Studies expires, she thinks she may leave academia.
“There haven't been that many jobs over the years that have been a good fit for me, and I don’t have the publication record to easily get any job,” Jones said.
She began working at Harvard as a College Fellow and had expected her position to be renewed. But it was not, and instead Harvard offered her a part-time lecture position teaching two classes. Jones said she could not have feasibly taken that offer if her family did not have other sources of income, but luckily, her husband had a stable job then.
“It was a good thing,” Jones said. “But if I had known in advance...that isn’t what I would have chosen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Economics concentrator Jing Qiu ’16 came to Harvard in the fall of 2012, she quickly joined the Harvard College Consulting Group, anticipating a potential career in consulting. But she soon found another calling: volunteer work with the Phillips Brooks House Association, Harvard’s dominant public service umbrella group.
“My parents brought me up with the belief that it’s everyone’s responsibility to give back—you need to do something for society,” Qiu said, referencing her shift in interests, which she has maintained through extracurriculars and internships. “You can’t go through life doing your own thing and ignoring the issues and problems that your community is facing.”
Qiu’s commitment to public service, however, has not been without its difficulties: As a first-generation college student, she faced financial pressures in finding employment that would support her mother as well as the preconceived notions of her immigrant family about the public service sector.
And as critics both in and outside Harvard heatedly debate whether the College sends too many of its graduates to careers in finance and consulting, Qiu finds herself far from alone in the challenges she has found in her participation in public service at Harvard.
About half of the student body engages in volunteer or service work during their time at the College, according to Travis A. Lovett, the director of the Center for Public Interest Careers, and many indeed face similar hurdles of time and money, both at the extracurricular level and later on when seeking internships and employment in non-profits and government work. And while College administrators seek to address these difficulties with limited resources, they must also contend with job market and economic realities outside of their control.
JOB DIFFICULTIES
For many students, formulating postgraduate plans can be a highly structured and well-resourced process. Harvard seniors interested in finance and consulting careers are greeted with coordinated efforts on the part of potential employers, who travel to campus to provide information and conduct interviews to fill what Robin Mount, the director of the Office of Career Services, calls “classes” of incoming employees.
Graduating seniors interested in public service, however, face an uneasy job market populated by employers without the same resources to recruit and hire graduates for their organizations.
To introduce more structure to the job search process for these students and to facilitate direct conversations with non-profit and governmental agencies, the College offered its first public service recruiting day last November. The initiative brought 20 public service organizations to campus for job discussions and interviews with 99 selected seniors, ultimately resulting in a dozen accepted offers of employment, according to Gene A. Corbin, the College’s assistant dean of student life for public service.
That event sought to address some of the unique challenges students seeking employment in the public sector face. According to Lovett, the recruiting process facilitated by financial services and consulting firms is hard for more financially sensitive nonprofits and government agencies to match, since many cannot anticipate their needs months in advance or take the risk of hiring a significant number of graduates with no predetermined role or responsibility.
According to Mount, OCS tries to help out such employers by using money obtained from for-profits to waive job posting and career fair fees for non-profits.
Further complicating job search in the public sector, Mount said, is the fact that many roles only open up after a departure at an organization and that nonprofits generally cannot afford to train students, meaning that the few positions they offer are unlikely to be entry-level ones that recent graduates can take. Mount said students heading into public service often have to wait some time to find a good match.
“When you’re looking for a job in the public interest sector, it’s not going to happen in the fall semester—it might not even happen halfway through the spring semester,” added Phillips Brooks House service to society fellow Robert C. Julien, who works on publicizing service opportunities at Harvard.
According to Lovett, 21 percent of Harvard College seniors go into a public service job, putting Harvard right in the middle of what he said was probably a 15 to 25 percent average across the Ivy League and other peer institutions.
But even before students grapple with an uncertain postgraduate job market, they face a similarly under-resourced process for finding and securing internships in the public service sector.
Last summer, according to Corbin, the College was only able to place 44 percent of the 888 students who applied for a summer internship through organizations such as the Phillips Brooks House Association, CPIC, and the Institute of Politics each year.
“We’re turning away a lot of students who care about service and want access to these programs,” Lovett said, adding that the inability to match student demand for service internships is largely a financial issue. “That’s a fairly alarming trend—I don’t think it’s a matter of lack of support from administration...it’s just that it’s going to take a really significant [financial] contribution to be able to expand opportunities.”
Corbin said one of his office’s priorities in the ongoing capital campaign is to expand participation in the College’s public service opportunities, creating a central “pot of money” to enable every student to do a summer of service if desired.
MONEY TROUBLES
But even after students obtain coveted public service internships, they can still face financial challenges, which for some can extend beyond summertime employment and stand in the way of term-time participation in public service.
Kevin E. O’Donnell ’16, who interned in New York City last summer as an IOP Director’s intern, said high housing costs made him pick up frequent side jobs like cat-sitting to break even, and that still left him with only $60 a week to budget for food.
“If there is someone who is in a more tight spot with financial aid, I would say that more [money] would definitely be necessary—because you’re definitely not earning any money,” O’Donnell said.
Lovett, who joined CPIC in 2006, said the Director’s Internship $4,000 stipend for domestic internships has not been updated for “as long as [he] can remember,” and noted that other stipends Harvard grants to students for summer work have also not been updated in several years.
“The reality is that $4,000 doesn’t cover a summer experience,” Lovett said. “That amount is probably closer to $6,000 or $7,000 today...I’ve been pushing for more funding.”
And several summer internships have not even reached the $4,000 mark—some internships offered by CPIC, for instance, offer stipends from $1,000 to $3,000. Corbin said one of his office’s capital campaign goals is providing $4,000 stipends across all service internships that the College offers, in addition to waiving the summer earnings contribution of any financial aid recipients.
Even if that is achieved, however, an economic disincentive for service could still remain for many students when they return to Harvard’s campus after each summer.
“Oftentimes for first-generation students, financial reasons can serve a barrier to pursuing extracurriculars, and even post-grad work, because that pressure to make money is always there,” said Jasmine A. Fernandez ’16, the president of the Harvard College First Generation Student Union.
The STRIDE Undergraduate Scholarship Program at PBHA, which provides some low-income students with a stipend for year-round service work, would seem to be the College’s antidote to that problem. Yet the Stride Rite Foundation that funded the program no longer exists, so the program itself now depends on insecure, temporary funding from PBHA itself, according to PBHA Executive Director Maria Dominguez Gray.
Once a first-generation college student himself, Lovett said addressing the financial obstacles to public service is at the top of his priority list.
“One of our biggest concerns [is how to] support the student who doesn’t have the financial means, or if they have the financial pressure, that they have to earn X amount of money to either pay for tuition, so we’ve been looking at summer earnings contributions, trying to figure out if there are ways we can waive that,” Lovett said. “Unfortunately, that’s extremely expensive...but we would love to be able to send the message that more students would be able to go into service.”
COMMITMENT ISSUES
While financial difficulties might drive away some students from public service activities, administrators and student volunteers say that still others might not participate in programs like PBHA because of other commitments and a culture of pursuing lucrative financial and consulting careers. As a result, the College’s public service community is often centered in pockets that may be isolated from the rest of the student body.
“Historically, public service has been on the margins of campus culture,” Corbin said. “It's been the committed students, instead of across the board.”
Harvard Public Service Network Manager Varsha Ghosh said she thinks the large time commitments of substantive service opportunities deterred students who are already engaged in other extracurricular opportunities.
“A person might be willing to give two hours, but not if that two hours is in addition to a 45-minute commute to Roxbury and coming back,” Ghosh said. “Getting the time commitment for a high quality volunteer experience that is serving the community as well as helping your own learning…is hard.”
Former PBHA resource development co-chair Ivy Z. Yan ’15 expressed concern regarding the fact that nearly half of the student body does not do public service, and said she was disappointed with the tendency of some students to engage sporadically with the service community.
“That’s an incredible body of people who we would like to get involved with service, because there are actually a lot of volunteer shortages in a lot of programs [at PBHA],” Yan said. “[But] this kind of lowest possible involvement to do service is unfortunate in my eyes because it’s not focused on the community, it’s not very intentional. It’s…get in, get out.”
Yan also said that there was certainly truth in Harvard’s reputation for “churning out” students who go into finance and consulting, characterizing it as the “path of least resistance.”
“I don’t think it’s Harvard saying, ‘You guys should all do Bain,’” former PBHA programming co-chair Vivian C. Shaw ’15 said. “I think they say that in the way their resources [are allocated].” Shaw pointed to funding for the On-Campus Interview Program and CPIC as an example of such resource allocation.
Harvard’s campus culture problem, Shaw argued, is also characteristic of a larger nationwide culture problem, and is a manifestation of what she said was Harvard and OCS’s desire to have students to succeed within an “existing structure.”
Still, Mount characterized OCS’s philosophy as a neutral one that wants to support students regardless of their career choice.
“Students are not considering careers at the moment,” she said. “They’re just choosing their first work experience and their first next steps—it’s kind of a journey that you guys are on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the United States Olympic Committee picked Boston as its candidate city for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in January, bid documents hailed Harvard as the potential host of 10 events and a key component in the effort to win the games.
Not five months later, public opinion polls show that local support for the games is hardly overwhelming, and Harvard’s leaders have insisted that the University has made no formal partnership with the bid. In Allston, where bid documents suggested using Harvard Stadium as well as proposed temporary venues to host sports like field hockey and aquatics, the University’s track record of false starts with construction and debate over benefits to the community has some residents reluctant to embrace the bid.
There is little doubt that the Olympics would bring notoriety and fanfare to the region. Yet nine years ahead of the potential arrival of the torch and two years ahead of the selection of the host city, Boston 2024 has yet to solidify a winning coalition with either Harvard or Boston.
‘A MARQUIS UNIVERSITY BRAND’
The backers of the Boston 2024 bid have not been shy about their desire to affiliate with Harvard.
In bid documents released shortly after Boston was named the USOC’s nominee, Harvard was featured prominently along with other area institutions like Boston University and the University of Massachusetts. The bid proposed hosting up to 10 events on Harvard property. Field hockey was slotted for Harvard Stadium, fencing for the Albert H. Gordon Track, and aquatics and tennis for proposed temporary venues on Harvard property in Allston. 
“The senior administrative officials of Harvard University have been involved in our planning,” the bid documents read, noting that Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp was serving on the Executive Committee for the Boston 2024 Partnership.
A few weeks after the proposals were released, Boston 2024 CEO Richard A. Davey called Harvard an important partner and said the University “has proposed to play a big role in 2024.”
Kennedy School of Government professor Juliette N. Kayyem ’91, who serves as chair of Boston 2024’s Security Committee, agreed that a working relationship between advocates of the bid and local University experts has been an important part of of the process.
“I think drawing on the subject matter expertise, whether you’re from MIT or Harvard or UMass or wherever, is actually really a value added for the cause of the 2024 bid,” Kayyem said this month. “We actually have homegrown talent that can figure this stuff out from urban planning to transportation to security. This is not going to be an imported Olympics that you saw for example in Sochi....We can do this. And I think that’s what ought to make Boston appealing.”
Harvard also figured into the USOC’s thinking when it selected Boston for its bid.
“What really enticed the United States Olympic Committee about Boston’s bid was with the Boston area being such a center of excellence in education, innovation, and brainpower, and Harvard is a part of that,” Patrick D. Sandusky, chief of public affairs and communications at USOC, said in a May interview.
Despite the praise from the USOC and Boston 2024 officials, however, Harvard University President Drew G. Faust and Lapp have pushed back. In early February, Faust said Harvard would not help the bid fundraise, even though Boston 2024’s Dec. 1, 2014, budget proposal suggested “collaborating with our college and university partners in this bid, whose established fundraising programs have created endowments that are among the largest in the country.”
“We would not divert fundraising to the Olympics, and we would not share names of donors who are confidential and part of Harvard’s community,” Faust said in February. “We would not share those beyond our own community.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal said recently that no deals have been struck.
“To date, Harvard has made no decisions nor given any commitments regarding the possible use of any specific venues in support of Boston 2024,” Neal wrote in a statement.
Neal also wrote that Lapp “no longer has any role with Boston 2024.”
ALLSTON TAKES CENTER STAGE
If the games do come to Boston, the city’s Allston neighborhood, which sits just across the Charles from Eliot House, will play a main role. But for decades, Allston residents have worked with Harvard as the University has purchased significant tracts of land and started and stopped major construction projects. The experience has not always been easy and has some Allstonians concerned about hosting the Games.
After major delays, a new home for Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is in early stages of construction and on pace to be completed by late 2017 or early 2018. The center was proposed by University President Lawrence H. Summers in 2003, but construction was halted in December 2009 during the financial crisis. Originally, the complex was slated to open in 2011.
Through the years, Harvard and Allston have also butted heads about the secret purchases through which Harvard acquired much of its land in Allston and about the benefits Harvard could create for Allston residents.
The experience, which many say improved when Summers and Faust worked closely with former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, nevertheless has some residents expressing mixed feelings about Boston 2024’s Olympic Bid, while others are excited at the potential benefits to be gained.
Renny McKinney, a resident of Allston, agreed that the relationship between Allston and Harvard has always been “complicated,” but he said he supports the bid. McKinney, who described himself as “grateful” to Harvard for the impact the University has had on Allston, says that he sees the same attitudes towards the proposed games as he’s observed some Allston residents have toward Harvard.
“People are very, very change averse,” McKinney said. “They’re very resistant to change, but on the other side of the coin, they’re very anxious to get any kind of benefit they can get.”
Polls have indicated that Boston residents would be more supportive of hosting the Olympic games if that decision came with the guarantee of benefits like improvement to public transportation.
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident, expressed concern over Harvard’s ambiguous stake in the upcoming games.
Characterizing the reception for the bid in many areas of Boston as “cool at best,” Mattison added that he believes Allstonians would be “open to considering” the bid, provided they gained a clearer view of potential benefits and impacts that could come of hosting so many of the Games’ slated events in Allston. “That means we’re open to considering it, but it doesn’t mean anything goes,” Mattison said. “What do we have in 2025, a giant empty lot where there used to be a swimming pool, and what good does that do for the neighborhood?
“If it’s just going to be some backroom deal struck between Harvard and City Hall...that’s hopefully not what it’s going to be,” Mattison said.
Christopher Dempsey, a Harvard Business School graduate who co-chairs the group No Boston Olympics, has also highlighted Allston’s up-and-down past with Harvard as he argued against the bid.
“I think the Allston community has seen the pros and cons of being cheek by jowl with Harvard,” he said. “There are benefits in terms of investment, in terms of community events, and there are drawbacks in terms of less control over development, having the University trying to expand into the existing neighborhood.”
Moving forward, Dempsey said, the bid and Harvard should clarify their relationship.
“I think the general public thinks that athletes are going to live in the dorms and Harvard is going to build a bunch of these venues or use existing venues without needing to use public dollars for those or even Olympic dollars,” he said.
“Boston 2024 is making it very clear that Harvard is ‘part of the team’ and is on board with the process, and we think we need more transparency about the commitments that are being made between Harvard and Boston 2024, if any,” Dempsey added.
“We don’t really know what that impact is, because we don’t know what the facilities are or how they’d be operated,” said Mattison.
A WEAK COALITION
Boston has until 2017 to make its case to the International Olympic Committee, but the bid has lingering support issues that may complicate its application.
Local residents have voiced their concerns about the bid, especially wary that, like so many recent games, the 2024 Olympics will overrun projected costs and ultimately be forced to use public funds to finance venues and execution of the games. According to a WBUR/MassInc poll, half of registered voters in Boston surveyed were not in favor of Boston’s Olympic bid, with just 40 percent in support.
The USOC has the option to change its candidate city for the 2024 Olympics by Sept. 15, 2015, giving the committee the opportunity to change course. Even after Boston was selected, Los Angeles has kept slim hopes of winning the bid alive.
And yet Paul S. Wylie ’90-’91, an Olympic silver medalist in figure skating, expressed a great deal of excitement about the games and reiterated his belief in the positive effects of bringing the Olympics to Boston and Harvard.
“I think Boston should be proud to have been selected,” said Wylie. “I know there has been a lot of noise and detractors, but we have an incredible chance to win the bid and it is an opportunity to show the world what a great city Boston is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September, as Harvard implemented a new approach to handling cases of sexual harassment, a group of professors at Harvard Law School wanted a change.
Upset with what they viewed as a flawed policy and their lack of a role in informing it, the professors set up a meeting with University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 to offer an ultimatum: Alter the University’s new policy and procedures, or they would publicly condemn Harvard’s approach. After conveying that message, and after realizing that change was not forthcoming, a group of professors followed through. The product was an open letter in the Boston Globe that publicly blasted Harvard’s policy as stacked against the accused.
Just about a month later, History professor Mary D. Lewis made a motion at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ monthly meeting calling for a repeal of Harvard’s new health benefits plan for non-union employees, which she and other professors charged placed unfair burdens on vulnerable members of the Harvard community. At that meeting, which saw unusually high attendance, the Faculty unanimously voted in favor of Lewis’s motion. The vote was purely symbolic, but it garnered the attention of University President Drew G. Faust and outside observers.
At both junctures, professors at the Law School and FAS sought to publicly decry administrative decisions with which they disagreed, but their options for response were limited. To criticize the health benefits changes, FAS professors turned to their central discussion forum—their monthly meeting, over which Faust presides and reporters from The Crimson and Harvard Magazine regularly attend—while the Law School, lacking such a public forum, went to a media outlet. But there was no central forum for them to convene and discuss the issues together.
The faculty outcry over two major University policy decisions made this year—the formation of the new Title IX framework and the roll out of the new health benefits plan—reflect a tension in Harvard’s governance structure: Even as administrators call for the unification of the University as “One Harvard” and more decisions are made in Massachusetts Hall, individual faculties remain largely divorced from one another, and when they have grief with a central decision, they lack a built-in forum to raise those concerns together.
The resulting tension has left some professors questioning the wisdom of central administrative decisions and whether a change is needed to ensure that they are guaranteed an opportunity to respond. A contingent of faculty critics, convinced that the current governance system at Harvard is in need of restructuring, have called for a unified body of faculty representatives from each school, dubbed a “faculty senate,” to weigh in on policy decisions. Such a move toward a more centralized faculty governance structure to match recent administrative trends would stand to change the way faculty interact with administrators and each other, but history suggests that change is far from guaranteed.
PRECIPITATING PROTEST 
Historically, when central administrators have made decisions that have prompted widespread faculty pushback, professors’ outcry over individual policies has often been accompanied by general discussions about their role in informing University decisions.
In 2006, amidst widespread criticism—and a vote of no confidence—from professors in FAS, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers, who maintained popularity among some other faculties, resigned. In the aftermath of that dramatic administrative reshuffling, Summers’s supporters questioned whether the conflict would have had a different outcome had faculties from across schools had a University-wide forum to deliberate the issue with each other. “One thing that was extremely important at that time was, what mechanisms did the faculty have to come together,” Anthropology professor Arthur M. Kleinman recalled.
Again, in 2013, in the wake of revelations that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of College resident deans, a group of professors from FAS called for a change in communications channels and questioned the school’s governance.
“I think that’s the context in which ideas about a faculty senate across all the schools have come up from time to time,” said Richard F. Thomas, a Classics professor. “When there’s either some sort of crisis or perceived crisis, or some issue that concerns groups of faculty who therefore by accident or by serendipity are in touch with each other.”
This year, faculty again have raised governance concerns in the wake of two controversial decisions that were handed down from Mass. Hall. After Harvard unveiled its new Title IX policy last summer, some faculty—particularly at Harvard Law School—responded in an uproar, charging in their Boston Globe letter that it was stacked against the accused. They, too, raised governance concerns: In establishing a central Title IX policy, rather than allowing individual schools their own jurisdiction of the issue, “Harvard undermined and effectively destroyed the individual schools’ traditional authority to decide discipline for their own students,” the 28 professors wrote.
At the same time, faculty from across the University—particularly within FAS—rallied in protest against the health benefits changes. Although the body that recommended the changes included some faculty members, professors argued that it was not representative and decried both the plan itself and what they perceived to be a lack of communication between administrators and faculty leading up to its creation.
In both cases, Harvard’s faculty members publicly and strongly disagreed with the central administration’s vision for University policy, and that disagreement sparked still more discussion about their role in the policymaking and feedback processes.
“Over the past decade or so, there has been a growing frustration,” said Susan R. Suleiman, a Comparative Literature professor who has been on leave this year. “This year there was a great dissatisfaction with health benefits, including the way it seemed to have been imposed. People feel they’re only consulted afterwards, if at all.”
LACKING A FORUM
While Harvard has in recent years centralized its administration and issued more policies that govern schools University-wide, faculty governance structures remain school-specific, based in faculty meetings and councils at individual schools. Today, Kleinman said, Harvard operates a “fine balance between decentralization and centralization,” as administration and policies are increasingly centralized but individual schools retain their autonomy.
The debates surrounding pushback against two of Harvard’s most recent central policymaking decisions have brought to light a more entrenched issue—the lack of a unified faculty body with representation from across Harvard’s schools. Some professors are concerned that the University’s faculties lack a forum to collectively discuss matters that involve them, and still others charge that Harvard’s central administration sometimes fails to properly communicate and engage. 
 According to Charles Fried, a Law School professor, there were communication issues in the new Title IX policy’s execution: Some Law professors said they did not learn about it until a school-specific implementation committee presented it to them at the beginning of the year, he said.
“That, in fact, was one of the defects of the process that the central administration had engaged in,” Fried said.
Administrators, including Faust, defend Harvard’s governance structure and maintain that in crafting these new University policies, they sought input from faculty. Administrators cite the Council of Deans, which meets with Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 on a monthly basis, as a venue in which school deans can represent the interests and concerns of their faculties. University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, for example, said her office consulted various groups—the Council of Deans, FAS’s Faculty Council, and other groups of deans and faculty members—while creating Harvard’s new sexual harassment policy.
Faculty, however, contest the argument that the Council of Deans is an adequate substitute for an open forum among faculties of the different schools. “It’s unrealistic to think that all problems can be solved by regular meetings between the deans and the president and provost,” Graduate School of Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 said.
“Faculty don’t only want to have input; they also want to have feedback,” said Christopher Winship, a Sociology professor. “As yet we don’t have a mechanism for broad feedback from faculty and non-union employees when Mass. Hall is considering major policy changes.”
Some faculty note the growth of administration at Harvard—and thus the decisions made centrally—and suggest that faculty communication channels have yet to catch up to reflect that change.
"All of a sudden, we wake up in a world, in fact because of government regulations, because of the vast amount of expansion, and voluntary terms, and government concern, etc., because of the very large number of administrative systems that's been hired by Dean [Michael D.] Smith and others, in fact, we are being run in a rather bureaucratic fashion,” said History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, a former Crimson editorial chair. “And people listen to us, and if there's pushback they may modify things, but somehow faculty control and input has slipped."
Former FAS Dean William C. Kirby, referring to a faculty governance body, argued that Harvard is behind its peers: “We are one of the few universities I know of that has no university-wide, faculty-led, governance body whatsoever,” he said.
A CALL FOR CHANGE
In March, two Law School professors published an op-ed in the Chronicle of Higher Education calling for changes to Harvard’s governance structures. The professors, Fried and Robert H. Mnookin, called for the creation of “a representative faculty senate that would include ladder-rank from all schools in the university” to “provide the administration with an opportunity to have university wide efforts discussed and assessed by a broadly representative group.”
Their call is reminiscent of an already established body embedded within Harvard’s University statutes, a University Council, created to address topics “which concern more than one Faculty, and questions of University Policy.” That body, though it remains in the University-governance document, has not met for several decades, and in the wake of this academic year’s policy debates, some professors are arguing that the University Council, or something like it, should once again exist.
For Fried and Mnookin, a representative faculty body with professors from across Harvard could have helped not only shape better policy at the University level, but also better respect a faculty-centric vision for the University.
This year, in light of growing concerns about central administrators’ decisions, a group of faculty critics are arguing that Harvard needs a new structure to incorporate the voices of professors at each of the University’s schools. Some, like Fried and Mnookin, propose the creation of a central faculty governance body—often called a faculty senate—as a solution. According to Thomas, who helped pen an op-ed denouncing the health benefits changes last fall, discontent over the new plan also spurred conversation among professors about establishing a University-wide faculty body to cull their various interests.
To advocates of a faculty senate, such a body could serve as a forum for discussion and feedback on major University policies and decisions. Fried argued that the existence of a faculty senate could have helped avoid the controversy surrounding last year’s Title IX policy changes, for example.
“In the course of the discussion, the very great defects in the drafts that came out of the Title IX office would have been laid bare, and having been laid bare, it's very hard for me to believe that it would have survived in that form,” Fried said.
Professors outside FAS argue that a faculty senate could also bring them a voice that they currently lack. FAS’s monthly meetings are covered by the news media, and top University administrators, including Faust, attend them, giving the body visibility. Other faculty meetings, however, are more private, leaving some professors to charge that FAS has disproportionate influence on University decisions that they do not.
Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, for example, said FAS currently “has far too much influence on the University” that he argues is not representative of faculty as a whole, especially in the realm of policies and programs that affect all schools, such as Title IX and the online learning platform edX.
“I think a University senate would help create a more representative voice of the faculty,” Dershowitz said.
Gardner, for his part, said he would not like to see power taken away from FAS—a faculty that he called central to Harvard—but suggested that FAS must adapt to a “new reality” in which administrative decisions increasingly affect the entire University. Like other professors, Gardner said a unified faculty body could help achieve this.
AN UPHILL BATTLE
But despite faculty calls in support of creating a central governance body, in practice, supporters face an uphill battle. If Harvard’s history is any indication of where the proposal for a faculty senate, or any major reconsideration of governance at Harvard, will head, the prospects do not look good. Seemingly each time faculty members have organized support for such a body, it has yielded little, if any, change.
Implementing a faculty senate proposal itself would be a challenge. To many faculty, how a university so decentralized could bring together its disparate faculties into one representative group is unclear.
While generally in favor of creating a faculty senate, History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said it would be difficult to create in practice because of the cultural differences between each of Harvard’s schools. “There are really significant differences between what FAS faculty do and the Medical School faculty do, just as the Medical School and Law School are doing fundamentally different things,” Jasanoff said.
Kennedy School of Government Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 suggested that there is a tendency to propose change in times of discontent, but following through is another issue. "Unless there's a really operational proposal, when there are problems people tend to want to create things, but it's far from clear that the cure isn't worse than the disease,” he said.
Fried, who wrote the op-ed publicly calling for the creation of a faculty senate, acknowledged that it is not an easy nor immediate project.
“This is a busy time. It’s in people’s heads, and maybe, on an appropriate occasion, somebody will pick it up; I can't tell,” Fried said. “I don't intend to make a career of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past 12 years, as many of Harvard’s top University offices have experienced turnover, at least one top position has remained constant.
Tucked away in Massachusetts Hall, in close proximity to the cycle of University presidents, Robert W. Iuliano ’83 has for over a decade sat at the helm of Harvard’s internal arm of lawyers who together make up its centralized Office of the General Counsel.
With 17 decorated lawyers, often out of sight, OGC defends Harvard from outside lawsuits. The office, however, also has a significant, and growing, role on campus. Top administrators consult OGC frequently on issues ranging from online education to Title IX.
OGC also gets involved behind the scenes. In the fall of 2012, when administrators wanted to search the email accounts of the College’s resident deans in an effort to plug a leak of information in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal, they called OGC. From start to finish, OGC dictated virtually every action to Harvard University Information Technology, including a round of searches found not to be in accordance with Faculty of Arts and Sciences policy. Amid faculty outcry, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who authorized the final round of searches, stepped down; OGC, whose attorney relayed administrators’ instructions, largely avoided public scrutiny.
OGC’s relative anonymity, however, should not be confused with irrelevance. Though the office’s roster of attorneys has not grown significantly in recent years, OGC’s influence and responsibilities have. Harvard’s prominence makes the University a popular target for lawsuits, and heightened federal regulations like Title IX make adequate compliance an increasingly complex goal. And as Harvard itself grows administratively and expands overseas and online, there are more internal policies to interpret at home. Increasingly involved in those decisions is an unseen apparatus of professionals charged with protecting Harvard and its interests.
“If you can think about a legal issue out there, we touch it in almost all cases,” Iuliano said in May.
CALL IN THE LAWYERS
When then-University President Derek C. Bok first established OGC in the 1970s, he wanted to reduce outside legal fees and, in an increasingly regulatory environment, hire lawyers with deep knowledge of the complex University who would oversee legal compliance.
"The combination really of expense and expertise just began to tilt very much in favor of developing your own legal staff," he said this month.
Although University administrators relied on the office and occasionally sought legal guidance, OGC operated more or less out of sight but on behalf of top administrators. Neil L. Rudenstine, who served as University president from 1991 to 2001, said his interactions with the general counsel’s office were “relatively infrequent.”
For today’s Harvard leaders, that is no longer the case.
When asked in a May interview how often she interacts with Iuliano, University President Drew G. Faust said she had met with him two days before and emails him often; his office is in Mass. Hall. Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said he “must have 100 conversations a year” with OGC about contracts in the school’s international employment and financial operations. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said conversations with OGC are “continuous” and that he has consulted with the office about issues that pertain to “important aspects of the College,” such as Title IX.
“I believe the role of the OGC here has expanded,” Faust said.
As an influential office connected to the central administration, OGC walks a fine line, especially on a campus where faculty have loudly challenged central decisionmaking and gravitated toward a philosophy of “every tub on its own bottom.”
While all administrators interviewed for this story praised the work of the office, some lawyers fear that general counsels may be making too many decisions for universities.
“The job of Harvard’s lawyers was protecting the intellectual integrity and freedom of its faculty and of its students,” said author and civil rights attorney Harvey A. Silverglate, who attended Harvard Law School in the 1960s. “And now the role of the University counsel is to make sure that the bureaucrats are not angry at Harvard.”
Silverglate, who has written on a national trend of increasing numbers of administrators on College campuses, said lawyers have swarmed campuses “like a locust plague” on universities since the 1980s and that now instead of faculty making policy decisions, general counsel lawyers and administrators take the lead.
So far, however, OGC has largely avoided faculty ire, and Faust and Iuliano say the office is responding to pressures from the government that in some cases require a more unified approach. Faust also discounted the argument that OGC might take policy decisions away from faculty actors.
“If faculty or others are uncomfortable...what they are uncomfortable about is the increasing scrutiny and regulation that were subjected to,” she said. “And it's the OGC as the arm of the University that responds to that.”
ANSWERING SUBPOENAS
Like all universities across the nation, Harvard is subject to legal disputes. But administrators and legal experts say that Harvard, because of its international reputation and prestige, faces increased legal scrutiny and attention. As the chief legal defenders of the University, OGC has increasingly had to defend against external litigation.
"If your goal is not to win the suit, but to get publicity, then there's no better target,” said Howard E. Gardner '65, a professor at the Graduate School of Education.
Beyond the publicity, some administrators say that bringing a lawsuit against Harvard in particular raises the stakes of a ruling, meaning it is not just media reputation at risk. “Filing a lawsuit against Harvard makes it more likely that…whatever happens in that lawsuit will then become precedent for lots of other schools, and people will pay attention,” Nohria said.
And though he does not often speak to the press—since he assumed his post as University general counsel and vice president in 2003, he has rarely spoken with The Crimson on the record—Iuliano does help manage Harvard’s publicity, maintaining a “very close” relationship with Harvard’s public relations shop, Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
“Much of what we do exists on the public boundary,” Iuliano said, adding that his office works with HPAC to “make sure that we are talking about that in a way that is responsible and consistent with the things that matter to us.”
When Harvard comes under legal attack, Iuliano vocally defends the University. Earlier this month, when more than 60 Asian-American groups charged that Harvard was discriminating in its undergraduate admissions processes, Iuliano wrote in a statement on HPAC’s website that the College’s admissions policies are “fully compliant with the law.”
He has also notified members of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and the Corporation about similar allegations, suggesting press inquiries be referred to HPAC and asking for Overseers’ and Corporation members’ “forbearance” when communicating about a case, according to hacked and published emails from Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO and Overseer Michael M. Lynton ’82.
The public relations strategy is necessary, in part, because of the volume of litigation that Harvard experiences. To deal with these cases, OGC typically hires outside firms who work with one internal attorney on litigation, meaning that staff normally do not interact with lawsuits on a daily basis. In 2013, the most recent year for which public tax filings are available, Harvard spent $13.04 million on outside legal fees, though Iuliano said some of that work may have been coordinated by offices other than OGC.
Now more than in the past, the University, through OGC, appears to be on the defensive. “This year is different. There’s been more litigation,” Iuliano said.
The list is long: A federal probe into the College’s Title IX compliance is ongoing. Another investigation into Harvard Law School finished in December when the government found the school in violation of Title IX and brokered a voluntary resolution agreement.
Suits from other parties have also been plentiful. In addition to the lawsuit and separate complaint challenging its affirmative action policy, Harvard was formally sued this spring by former associate Anthropology professor Kimberly Theidon, who claims that the University denied her tenure in part out of retaliation for comments she had made in support of victims of sexual assault.
The University is also the target of a lawsuit charging that its online content violates the Americans with Disabilities Act because it lacks captions. And although a judge recently dismissed a case from some student environmental activists who argued that the University was engaging in “abnormally dangerous activities” by investing in fossil fuel companies, the group plans to appeal.
“Direct legal action against anyone here—the first phone call is to OGC. We don't answer subpoenas,” said Sarah E. Wald, chief of staff and senior policy adviser at the Kennedy School of Government.
INCREASING INFLUENCE 
As the University faces increased scrutiny and federal guidance on regulations ranging from Title IX to real estate, property, and intellectual rights, OGC’s importance and influence at Harvard is only growing. More so than ever before, the federal government is regulating and looking to intervene in University affairs, even the tenure process, according to higher education experts.
Across the nation, many institutions have just recently propped up or increased the size of their offices of general counsel, said Jonathan R. Alger, who has worked in general counsel offices and now serves as president of James Madison University.
General counsels are also increasing their workloads, according to Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law. “There's never been a time where general counsels were more worked than they are right now,” Lake said.
The anti-sex discrimination law Title IX in particular has been a hot spot of discussion on campuses this year, as the federal government opened more investigations and released additional guidance documents. Harvard is no exception to the pressure, and in July 2014, the University drastically modified its approach to handling sexual violence on campus.
“Society as a whole is much more regulated, and as there’s an increased set of regulatory obligations that every actor in American society has to meet, we’re not immune from that, and we have to figure out how to do what we’re trying to do within that context,” Iuliano said.
Federal regulations go far beyond Title IX. The rulebook has also made it more difficult to navigate federal grant applications, and as a result Harvard’s researchers have increasingly turned to OGC for advice: Ara Tahmassian, the University’s chief research compliance officer, said his department in the Office of the Vice Provost for Research has increasingly relied on OGC to provide advice to professors submitting research proposals or funding applications to his office. Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez, similarly, said he is in contact with OGC lawyers daily to maintain overseas research centers, which come with the unique legal requirements of the countries that host them, and coordinate study abroad programs.
To both handle this workload and defend Harvard in court, OGC tries to attract the best, and it does, for largely the same reason Harvard is a target for lawsuits: In the business of university attorneys, Harvard’s OGC has a strong reputation, lawyers say. The positions are quite competitive and the turnover in staff is infrequent, Iuliano said. According to Bok, a single opening on OGC, as he learned during his presidency, once attracted about 1,000 applicants.
OGC’s current attorneys—many of whom are graduates of Harvard, Yale, or Columbia law schools—have been on staff for an average of 13 years each, even if not for relative monetary gain. Margaret H. Marshall, Harvard’s former general counsel, said she would only leave Harvard for one position, as she did in 1996—to serve on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
To some, Harvard’s legal apparatus has earned the University a formidable reputation. “Harvard is known for litigating aggressively,” Brian O’Reilly, an attorney who is facing Harvard’s Office of Technology Development in ongoing litigation, wrote in an email. “My client hired me because he knew that if he sued Harvard he was going to be in for a long tenacious battle. And that is exactly what’s happened.”
THE NEW POLICYMAKERS
OGC’s role transcends assisting professors with legal paperwork. With the increased external regulations and internal institutional complexity, Harvard leaders also rely on OGC for policy guidance. This side of OGC often goes unnoticed by the public, but is becoming increasingly more prevalent, and not without controversy.
In general, when it comes to forming policy, administrators now frequently consult OGC, whether at the beginning stages of or after creating policies.
“Any policy that you want to create at this school which reflects any change, you want to make sure that the OGC will at least take a quick look at it and make sure that you’re not doing something that unwittingly…puts either the University or the individual [at risk],” Nohria said.
In 2008, when the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights investigated Harvard Medical School’s Title IX compliance, OGC attorney Ellen F. Berkman ’86 communicated frequently with the lead investigators. Berkman persistently rebutted claims that the school had failed to act in compliance with Title IX but, according to case documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, suggested a set of policy modifications.
“This proposal would likely have to be reviewed by administrative or faculty committees,” Berkman wrote. OCR eventually accepted modifications and entered the Medical School into a voluntary resolution agreement.
That was hardly the first, or last, time OGC played a key role in policy formation. And while the office, by design, represents the singular interest of the University, individual schools, professors, and administrators can disagree, leaving OGC in a mediatory position that sometimes raises more than just legal questions.
Most recently, this past year, professors at Harvard Law School sparred with the central administration over the University’s new Title IX policy and procedures, which leaders designed to bring further consistency to varying approaches across schools. When Law School professors lambasted the central office as stacked against the accused and later expressed their concerns to administrators, Faust allowed them to work with Iuliano to come up with a school-specific set of procedures.
“His role in that was trying to come up with a solution that would address the deeply felt concerns of the Law School faculty but also meet the criteria that were necessary to meet the University's commitments and obligations,” Faust said. “So he was negotiating on behalf of the University for an agreement that would work for everybody in this instance, which is what he and I discussed and what I asked him to do.”
Speaking in broad terms, Iuliano said there are occasions where “sufficient conflict” among constituents means that a decision whether a policy should stick with a decentralized or more unified approach “gets moved to a different part of the organization.”
For some, however, OGC’s involvement in administrative decisions—largely unseen by faculty members—raises questions. Sharon L. Howell, a former College resident dean, said OGC’s role in 2013’s email search scandal, detailed in a report by an outside lawyer, was just one instance where the office may have “played more of a leading role than was appropriate.”
Although Howell said OGC plays a critical function in advising leaders, she said there was a sense among some faculty that the balance had tipped away from one of supplementary guidance.
“The administration would be consulting General Counsel and following General Counsel’s lead rather than following the lead of faculty who govern the school,” Howell said, describing the impression of some faculty members. “Instead of just being counsel, they were driving decision-making based on some fear of litigation.”
Although Iuliano and administrators insist the office has not usurped administrative or faculty influence, that the office plays an ever more important but mostly silent role at the University seems unambiguous.
On a quiet Wednesday afternoon this month, after Faust answered a few more questions from The Crimson, she led two reporters out of her office, exchanging goodbyes as they went. After they were gone, she said earlier, she would prepare for a scheduled meeting with Iuliano.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 11, 2015, at 3:56 p.m.
Today, the clang of jackhammers seems ubiquitous at the corner of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street in North Allston.
As construction teams demolish one aged apartment complex, a replacement springs up across the street. After years of false starts and unrealized plans, one thing is certain in North Allston: Harvard’s development is underway.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory board managed by the Boston Redevelopment Authority made up primarily of Allston residents, played an active role in the finalization of the University’s development plans in the fall of 2013. With construction underway, however, some Allston residents feel like this avenue of communication can no longer do enough to guarantee a community voice is heard in future conversations regarding Harvard’s construction.
In its current iteration, the University’s planned development in Allston includes a nine-project Institutional Master Plan for 1.4 million square feet of new construction and 500,000 square feet of renovations, a retail and residential commons, and a new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex. Preliminary work on the SEAS complex has started, and a number of building construction projects both at the Business School and in Barry’s Corner are nearing completion.
Allston residents say that communication from the University on its construction remains constrained by what they describe as a failure to reach certain core constituencies and to engage them on meaningful topics on the future of the neighborhood.
While representatives from the University point to efforts to improve outreach and draw more segments of the community into the conversation, Allston residents like Paola M. Ferrer say that barriers continue to impede engagement from minorities, non-native English speakers, low-income residents, and residents who are less knowledgeable about Harvard’s relationship with Allston.
These outreach challenges are compounded by allegations that the University refuses to engage the community in good faith.
“I don’t think that there is a real concerted effort to put the entire project on the table for comments from the neighborhood," Allston resident Galen Mook said
OUTREACH OBSTACLES
According to BRA senior project manager Gerald Autler, the BRA provided interpreters at community meetings around 2006 and 2007. The BRA ultimately discontinued those services, however, in the face of under-utilization. Years later, Allston residents are questioning whether task force meetings are accessible to all constituents.
According to Ferrer, an apparent lack of enthusiasm toward interpretation services does not necessarily indicate an unwillingness on the part of non-native English speakers to participate in community development.
“We need to challenge the assumption that only a very narrow segment of the community [is] interested in the community,” said Ferrer, who also sits on the Harvard-Allston Task Force. “The positive development of the neighborhood is something that matters to all constituencies.”
Rather than a failure among Allston residents to take full advantage of inclusionary services provided at meetings, Ferrer and other Allston residents point to what they say are shortcomings in Harvard’s and the BRA’s outreach efforts.
“Generally, a specific segment of the population is interested in task force meetings and others are not—and we might not be hitting everyone who might be interested,” acknowledged Autler, who characterized current outreach efforts as effective but imperfect. Autler suggested using an online forum to engage constituencies who cannot make meetings due to conflicting work schedules.
For Allston residents without an Internet connection, however, Harvard’s development plans may be out of reach. According to Annie Tomasini, a Harvard spokesperson, much of the University’s contact with Allston residents occurs online through newsletters, Facebook, and Twitter.
“It’s not like everybody has a computer in Allston; many of the people in Allston are blue-collar,” resident Renny McKinney said. “If they do Internet-only, they don’t hit many people—once in a while, we get a postcard, and that’s not enough.”
According to Tomasini, the University does supplement these weekly online communications with hard-copy mailings a handful of times each year, much of which are in English, and monthly drop-in meetings with senior project personnel that are open to the public. With just this connection to Harvard’s development trajectory, members of the community who do not regularly attend information meetings lack the level of prerequisite knowledge to fully participate in the discussion, Ferrer said.
“When I was put on the task force, it was monumentally difficult for me to get up to speed; it’s really difficult to have a context to be engaged in the present,” Ferrer said. “If you don’t have a certain knowledge, then you can’t participate.”
Ferrer also said that inconsistently scheduled task force meetings conflict with other community meetings—such as those of the Allston Civic Association—and can create challenges for residents with children and busy work schedules.
According to Allston resident Richard Parr ’01, the responsibility for outreach failures may not lie solely on the University but also in the composition of the Allston community itself. According to Parr, the neighborhood’s high percentage of transient residents, who are less likely to participate in community organizing, creates a unique outreach challenge. Only 10.2 percent of housing units in Allston were resident-owned in 2011.
“We have a large population of students and people who move in and out,” Parr said. “So it is a challenge for an institution to do outreach in a community with people who might not be there some time down the line.”
A ONE-WAY STREET
Even some Allston residents who are able to participate in the community discussion, however, find themselves wondering if Harvard engages in an open partnership or conversation with the community. Some say that Harvard pursues and announces projects relevant only to its self-interest.
“Announcements that come from Harvard come in one direction, but community input doesn’t really go the other way,” said Mook, an Allston resident. “It’s a little myopic, isn’t it?” Mook expressed hopes that the University would at least show that suggestions from neighborhood leaders would be taken and considered in good faith.
“There should be transparent awareness,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications. “There isn’t a project that isn’t aired before community meetings, city approval processes, or the task force.”
Despite efforts made by Harvard to include Allston residents in conversations about development, imbalances of power manifests themselves, according to Allston residents, in the very structure of the task force meetings.
“One of the communication problems is that when Harvard is getting ready to present something, they simply come in, present it, and we have little or no time to respond,” said Ed Kotomori, who co-chairs the Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee. Kotomori suggested that Harvard should share presentation materials before meetings out of respect for residents, allowing them to prepare questions.
According to Casey, Harvard does try to hand out meeting material ahead of time, but the oftentimes dense nature of the material may create misunderstandings.
“Our information needs narrators,” he said.
Other Allston residents named additional problems with the task force serving as the primary mode of communication between Harvard and the neighborhood. McKinney called for added time for residents who do not sit on the task force to ask questions of Harvard representatives. For Ferrer, the presentation format succeeds in disseminating information but discourages participation, a problem that could potentially be solved by more interactive-style meetings.
For Allston resident and task force member Harry E. Mattison, the University appears more interested in promoting its own events than in engaging residents in a discussion of how to translate its long-term development projects into tangible quality of life improvements for community members.
“There’s a difference in marketing Harvard’s programs and having a collaborative joint planning conversation about the future of the neighborhood,” said Mattison, who resents what he describes as the discrepancy between community participation in the development process and the pace of improvements to Western Avenue, a potential social and economic hub of North Allston.
“I’ve pretty much run out of patience because I’ve spent hundreds of meetings and hundreds of hours and years and years trying to do that, and it’s got us the Western Ave. that we have today, which is not much of a Western Ave.,” Mattison said.
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
For some, any attempts by Harvard to improve communication come too late. Residents and University representatives agree that the planning stage of Harvard’s Allston development has passed with the approval of Harvard’s IMP and the finalization of the University’s associated package of community benefits in 2013. And for residents, there is a real fear that the end of the planning stage brings an end to opportunities for community input. While the Harvard-Allston Task Force does still hold its meetings, they have become far less frequent and discussions revolve around specific details of construction rather than bigger ticket items.
“We are in a phase after intensive meetings,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications. “We have been in the process of implementing that plan and the fruits of that are now being seen.”
For some Allston residents, however, those fruits do not seem so sweet, and feelings of exhaustion and fatigue, rather than reward, accompany discussions of the implementation of Harvard’s IMP.
“We tried to have some broader conversations a couple of years ago when the master plan was being reviewed...In a way, there’s nothing even to discuss,” Mattison said. “We’re sort of at this point where there is no master plan to talk about, just small things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an undergraduate, Herbert B. Castillo ’14 could not work toward a degree in his field of choice—not because of a lack prerequisite skills, faculty support, or motivation but because Harvard College did not offer the appropriate concentration.
Castillo describes “a lot of pushback” when he, and other students like him, tried to influence administrators to create a program specifically for Latino studies.
“A lot of times we were frustrated at the fact that we weren’t being heard,” Castillo said.
But after years of faculty and student frustration, the College next fall will debut a Latino studies secondary field within the Standing Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights and a track within the Romance Languages and Literatures Department, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
The formation of these programs follows decades of administrative shutdown of repeated calls for Latino studies. Throughout that time, and despite news of the expansions within RLL and EMR, professors have rebuffed administrative decisions, choosing instead to pursue Latino studies not under a formal program. Students, meanwhile, have gathered for town hall discussions about advocating for a program at Harvard.
In separate realms across campus, yet all with one voice in favor of Latino studies, professors and students have chartered their own paths for this field and are hoping still for increased recognition and support. Their unified and persistent efforts have successfully revitalized the dialogue on campus and prompted administrative steps in cementing the place of Latino studies at Harvard.
STOP AND GO
Across University divisions, students and their professors for a long time have fought to make Latino studies a viable option within Harvard’s curriculum. While administrators have approved some programs, the stop-and-start nature of student and faculty efforts and the mixed results they have garnered over time have resulted in disparate programs.
“This is really an issue that’s gone on for so long...because...it doesn’t live in one place and because of those piecemeal efforts,” said Jeannette Soriano Gonzalez ’01, who served as co-chair of Concilio Latino, the University-wide umbrella organization for coordination and communication about Latino and Latin American groups on campus.
David Carrasco, professor for the study of Latin America at Harvard Divinity School who came to Harvard in 2001, said he has wanted Latino studies to become a “profound” area of study here since his employment began.
Carrasco said he has felt continually disheartened by what he calls a glaring absence in curricular offerings.
“Several times we’ve been on the verge of something...but the administration has pulled back,” Carrasco said. “In this particular area, Harvard is not a leader.”
In the early 2000s, Soriano said she helped organize town hall meetings in conjunction with professors Doris Sommer and Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, now at the University of California, Los Angeles, to discuss their hopes for Latino studies at Harvard. Attended by more than 70 students, the meetings were productive in creating a unified student-faculty voice but lost momentum because of administrative shutdowns, she said.
In 2002, for example, some prominent faculty members wrote a proposal for the creation of a Center for Latino Studies at the University and sent it to then-University President Lawrence H. Summers.
Despite administrative turndowns, students and professors continued to raise their concerns.
“There’s always been this desire [for Latino studies],” Soriano said. “You hit up against bureaucratic realities. They saw that [Summers] was not basically for this plan. Those [are] kind of hurdles, unless there’s a concerted effort on the part of the University.”
Still, professors and students have continued to agree that Latino studies should represent an important part of Harvard’s course offerings.
ACCELERATION
Across Harvard, renewed calls for Latino studies program have in part been answered by the two new programs, some students and professors said. But some professors have pointed to their own courses individually as academic changes already in the works, long before the news of the EMR secondary field in Latino studies and the track in the Department of Romance Languages and Literature.
Responding to what they say is a lack of programming in Latino studies, professors over the past few years have taken the matter into their own hands, contributing to a growing number of courses in the field.
“[I]n recent years, there have been a lot of faculty...committed to provide students with courses [in which] they can explore issues regarding Latinos,” said Maria L. Parra-Velasco, senior preceptor in Romance Languages and Literatures. “We’re not that many, but certainly there are important efforts on campus.”
Through their persistent efforts, professors and their students have formed an alliance and supported courses that foster topics that they deem important to study.
“I think that we do see a vibrant interest in Latino studies now, both among students and faculty,” EMR Program Administrator Tessa L. Desmond said. “There are a number of faculty who are [creating] a foundation, all actively working to develop a curriculum in Latino studies.”
The secondary field and Romance Languages and Literatures concentration track represent a more formal approach to Latino studies at the College.
At this point, the EMR Committee, home of the new Latino studies secondary field, plans to support professors as they continue to hone their specific courses, Desmond said.
CONTINUING THE DRIVE
At the same time, however, some professors say that a larger, more centralized approach to Latino studies, perhaps through a department or concentration, would benefit the field, drawing comparisons to the revitalization of African-American studies at Harvard through the establishment of a distinct committee in that field.
The new programs leave much to be desired, according to some professors, who not only want to continue refining their courses independently but to promote the importance of Latino studies on their own terms.
“[W]e also want to offer a concentration in Latino studies,” Parra-Velasco said. “And I’m sure that the Divinity School might have other possibilities. So now, you see things growing in different places, and I think that now the thing is going to be how we can start consolidating those possibilities.”

Carrasco, for his part, wrote in an email that although the secondary field and Romance Languages and Literatures track options indicate a step in the right direction, he sees these developments as part of an “unfinished product.”
“By this I mean both initiatives show the potential Harvard has, through the profs and students making these moves, to be the intellectual leader in this crucial area,” Carrasco wrote, adding that a “[s]econdary field is good. A Center or department or 'primary field' is much better and overdue.”
Yet the EMR Committee does not count as one of its goals pushing administrators to expand the secondary field to become a concentration or a department, according to Desmond. Instead, Committee members hope “to build a solid program with what we have,” she said.
“Our goal is to work with the faculty who are working in these areas...to identify curricular gaps...given the resources we’re allocated...build the strongest program we can given the University’s framework,” Desmond added.
Dean of the Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen also said she does not see the next step for Latino studies as turning the secondary field or the concentration track into its own department, citing the importance of interdisciplinary learning that a departmental structure would stifle.
“I feel that creating new departments only isolates people," Sorensen said.“I think the key thing is to have the field be present in a lot of departments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a typical Saturday night at Harvard, and undergraduates have flocked to Mt. Auburn Street, where parties rage on. Several of the College’s final clubs line one side of the street, known for its concentration of the historic social organizations. In the middle sits a building known simply as “The Castle,” home to the country’s preeminent undergraduate humor magazine and one of Harvard’s most exclusive social scenes.
The final clubs on the south side of the street have a lot in common with the Harvard Lampoon. Both host parties; guest lists often determine which non-members may enter their doors. Prospective members must navigate lengthy processes to gain admission.
But there is one key difference: While final clubs long ago severed formal ties with the University, the Lampoon is officially a recognized student group according to Harvard College.
The Lampoon’s relationship with Harvard’s administration is indicative of the blurred line that determines which student groups may benefit from official College recognition and the perks that may accompany it—the right to apply for funding, reserve rooms, publicize events on campus, and use the Harvard name.
Administrators this year have embarked on a movement to publicly question the role and values of the College’s unrecognized student groups, including final clubs and Greek organizations, led by new Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and his more vocal approach to the issue. Behind the scenes, he has met with leaders of final clubs and other unrecognized social groups and questioned their practices, particularly the groups whose memberships are single-gender.
But while administrators focus publicly on these groups outside of their jurisdiction, there are others that operate on similar grounds but without the same scrutiny. Despite its stated commitment to the contrary, Harvard recognizes some groups that are effectively single-gender. Other officially sanctioned groups are largely social in function and run competitive processes to determine their memberships. And as administrators increase pressure on unrecognized groups to conform to their definition of inclusivity, some students question whether the College is being consistent—and if it even realizes what goes on within its gates.
THE RULES OF THE ROAD
Last fall, Jimmie Hill ’18 met with College administrators to request that they recognize the fraternity whose presence he recently brought to campus, Delta Kappa Epsilon. Hill hoped he could work with the College to gain the benefits that come with recognition and provide what he believes is a service to campus.
He sooned learned, though, that DKE had no chance of gaining official recognition. Administrators at the College told him that they would not recognize his fraternity, citing the fact that its membership is restricted to men.
That response is consistent with administrators’ public statements about the College’s student organizations, which now number more than 400. On paper, the criteria for official recognition is cut and dry: For a student group to earn recognition today, it must comply with guidelines outlined on the OSL’s website. Some are tangible, such as having at least 10 members, a constitution, and a proposed budget; others are more abstract, such as demonstrating that the group provides benefits to campus, is not a duplicate of a group that is already recognized, and is in “alignment with the Mission of the College to educate citizens and citizen leaders of our society.”
Proposed constitutions must also include a non-discrimination clause stipulating that “membership in this organization shall be open to all students in good standing currently enrolled in Harvard College, regardless of race, creed, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or physical disability.”
Against the backdrop of recognized student groups are several firmly established unrecognized clubs, including fraternities, sororities, final clubs, and other social groups. Every year, final clubs punch, or put up for entry, hundreds of students. The clubs then winnow down prospective members through several rounds until each admits roughly a couple dozen members.
Most of these unrecognized social clubs are single-gender. In 1984, as administrators became increasingly concerned that the campus social scene was male dominated, the University asked its male final clubs to extend their memberships to women. The clubs declined and effectively severed official ties with Harvard.
Today, when they discuss the final clubs and Greek organizations they refuse to recognize, administrators often cite their single-gender memberships—and criticize them without ambiguity. In 2011, before he became the College’s top administrator, Khurana said he was “always suspicious of a club that builds itself on gendered exclusivity.” In March, Khurana reaffirmed his comments: “The College continues to support the idea that…single-gendered organizations are not appropriate for the College,” Khurana said.
Administrators also speak generally about wanting to combat “exclusivity” in campus organizations. Khurana blasted a controversial party invitation that the Spee Club circulated to some students in March, labeling it “offensive, crude, and sexist.”
This call from the top for increased critique of campus social life—and particularly unrecognized groups like final clubs—has trickled down. Students are taking note: In April, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations hosted an off the record conversation about exclusivity in social spaces at the College. Shortly thereafter, anonymous blogs published lists of students they claimed were members of final clubs.
The Crimson is not officially recognized by the College so as to remain independent from Harvard, but it does enjoy some benefits traditionally associated with recognition.
A CROOKED PATH
But while administrators suggest that there is a clear definition of which groups are “inclusive” enough to earn College recognition, in practice, the line is blurred.
The College tells fraternities and groups such as the all-female Seneca that it will not recognize single-gender organizations, for example (Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, who oversees student group recognition, said he does not remember recognizing a single-gender group in recent years).
But in practice, there are in fact single-gender groups on the books: Several performance organizations on campus, including some a capella groups and the cast of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, are single-gender. And there are sanctioned social organizations that are effectively single-gender and largely operate like their unrecognized equivalents. The Asian American Brotherhood, a social and service organization geared toward Asian American students listed on the OSL’s website as a recognized student group, is one example.
Although AAB, founded in 1999, includes a non-discrimination clause in its constitution, the rosters listed on its website indicate that its membership—whom it dubs “brothers”—is all male.
Several members of AAB did not return requests for comment for this story, but its website describes it as a group that “seeks to promote intercultural understanding and social activism at Harvard and beyond” with three pillars of “Service, Activism, and Brotherhood.”
The group’s constitution details the organization’s “fraternal social structure” and lists as one of its codes of conduct to “always uphold gentlemanly behavior.” Membership biographies on its website also allude to the “fraternal” nature of the group: One member, Andy Kim ’17, wrote in a post, which was taken down from the site late last week, that he originally thought of the group as “just another exclusive fraternity” but that he “found that AAB is a group of distinct, yet similar, caring guys who bond together. I learned the purpose of the exclusivity and saw the positive effects of it in the connections between each brother and throughout the brotherhood as a whole.”
Its membership is capped at 40 people, according to its constitution.
Other recognized groups, while not single-gender, also admit very few applicants and have a large social function. For instance, Crimson Key Society, a recognized student group that gives campus tours and coordinates freshman week and parents’ weekends, among other activities, holds various regular social events including parties. Its comp process lasts two rounds, and only a small fraction of students seeking to join the group successfully make it through the comp—generally about 30 of 150 or more compers, according to its website.
According to Undergraduate Council President and Crimson Key Society member Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, a factor of what holds the group together is a likeness in personality. Nasrollahzadeh added that members of Crimson Key tend to be “outgoing.”
Besides its parties, the Lampoon—a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine—is similarly famous for its competitive comp process, which students often enter multiple times in attempt to join the staff. Several Lampoon members directed questions about the comp to president Calvin W. Willett ’16, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment; Friedrich, who confirmed that the Lampoon is recognized, declined to comment on specifics when asked about their comp process and initiations.
But Jack C. Smith ’15, the former vice president of Harvard’s chapter of fraternity Sigma Chi, described the Lampoon as “a final club” whose members join largely for social reasons and said he believes Crimson Key is primarily a social group.
Khurana, for his part, has also this year talked to leaders of recognized student groups about comps and other issues. He said he does “worry that there are some recognized student groups that are not always considering how their practices of membership or the sort of subculture that they might have might unintentionally make people feel like they don’t belong.”
But with hundreds of student groups under the College’s umbrella, administrators—Khurana included—are not aware of all their practices. When asked to comment on AAB, for example, Khurana said he lacked sufficient prior knowledge of the group and needed to learn more.
Some of the recognized groups that critics label as “exclusive” may have been recognized some years ago. According to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, there is “history of certain organizations that have been grandfathered in” to recognition. Friedrich said his office periodically checks on constitutions, but that he does not remember revoking an organization’s official recognition in recent years.
TWO ROADS DIVERGE
The fact that these groups enjoy official College recognition has drawn some ire from members of unrecognized groups. “Maybe the administration doesn't know about what goes on,” Smith said, “but they would have to be, in my opinion, absolutely turning a blind eye to it to pretend that they don't know that these organizations are exclusive or that they have practices which would be highly criticized if they were conducted by another group.”
“Organizations that are generally unrecognized are, in some ways, just as exclusive as organizations that are recognized,” added Jason A. Solis ’16, the current president of Sigma Chi.
Jacob T. Bradt ’16, president of the unrecognized Oak Club, has met with College administrators to discuss the social scene at the College and said he appreciates their efforts, but added there may be a certain stigma associated with unrecognized groups. He readily admits he that he views the Oak as exclusive because there is an “evaluative process” that members must successfully complete to join. But he said there are recognized groups that are “equally, if not perhaps more, exclusive” than the Oak.
Friedrich maintains that his office should maintain a relationship and open dialogue with the recognized and unrecognized clubs, as opposed to being a punitive force. “I think that organizational change is a challenge, and our role is to be a resource and a support to students who are thinking critically about how they operate,” he said.
But others call for more drastic change, charging that the College should be consistent in enforcing—and understanding—student groups’ membership rules. Former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who is in the Oak Club, said Harvard should recognize all social groups so it can regulate them. Hill and Smith, both members of unrecognized fraternities, said they want the College to either recognize or not recognize all groups that are single-gender or serve large social functions while only admitting fractions of interested students.
“I’m not necessarily advocating for the University to recognize all of the groups or not recogniz[e] any of these groups,” Smith said, “but I think whatever they do, it should be consistent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last July, Harvard could seemingly breathe a sigh of relief.
The University had just unveiled a new policy and set of procedures intended to centralize and revamp its approach to handling sexual harassment and to ensure compliance with the anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. Within the new framework, Harvard was now in close line with increasingly demanding federal standards from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, and many activists on campus lauded the new policy as an important step to reform Harvard’s approach to an issue that had recently begun to dominate national discourse. 
But within days, the sense of ease faded, once again, into months-long controversy, criticism, and debate. Undergraduates continued to criticize the policy on the grounds that its language needed clarifying and that it lacked an explicit affirmative consent clause. They argued that the College also needed to augment mandatory Title IX training, increase the transparency of its disciplinary board, and further centralize accommodations for victims of sexual violence.
Other Harvard affiliates had their own concerns and used the same tactic of public engagement to air them. As it quickly became clear, however, the messages did not always align and were at times directly in conflict.
In October, a group of 28 professors at Harvard Law School published an open letter in The Boston Globe that slammed Harvard’s new policy and procedures, arguing that they were “overwhelmingly stacked against the accused, and are in no way required by Title IX law or regulation.”
The Law School professors followed through with their criticisms, adopting a set of Title IX procedures totally separate from the University’s. The undergraduate activists also did more than speak out: In December, they organized a satirical bake sale to fundraise for the understaffed Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, the new central office responsible for investigating cases of alleged sexual misconduct. The federal government, for its part, found Harvard Law School in violation of Title IX in December, bringing to an end its years-long probe. Harvard College remains under investigation.
In a year marked by heightened federal scrutiny of sexual harassment at colleges and universities across the country, Harvard is faced with the task of accommodating disparate demands from both outside and within the University. Administrators can hold town halls and open their doors to feedback from critics on campus, but while stuck in the midst of a polarizing argument over how best to address sexual assault and disagreements over the basic interpretation of Title IX, Harvard, realistically, cannot please everyone. Compromise, as this year has shown, is no solution to such a heated debate.
“What we're seeing very prominently now is that people are getting criticized from just about every direction,” said Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law.
UNDER PRESSURE
The past academic year has seen increased federal scrutiny and media attention to sexual assault on campus, leaving many universities, including and especially Harvard, scrambling and often debating best practices to meet Title IX requirements, according to experts in higher education law.
“The last academic year has seen more tension in higher education on the issue of sexual violence than any academic year in history, without question,” said S. Daniel Carter, the director of 32 National Campus Safety Initiative, a group that advises colleges on campus safety issues.
With dozens of outstanding investigations into higher education institutions’ Title IX compliance, OCR is also more visibly and critically evaluating universities than in years past. Between this and last April alone, the federal government has released more than 90 pages of regulatory guidance on Title IX, covering topics from the preferred evidence standard for investigations to the role of Title IX coordinators.
Coupled with increased federal oversight, media attention to the issue of campus sexual violence has emblazoned a national fervor for debates over Title IX, ranging from technical procedural questions about investigation and discipline to broader disagreements about OCR’s jurisdiction. Attempts to appease everyone while complying with federal law are at best naive, according to legal experts.
“I don’t think you can please everybody,” said Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center. “I just don't think you can.”
STUCK IN THE MIDDLE
At Harvard in particular, the attention, debate, and public activism have hit home. From federal oversight to petitions, posters, and public demonstrations from student activist groups, the University is facing, and responding to, increased pressures.
But these debates are hardly uniform. They extend beyond demands from students to administrators: Across Harvard Yard at the Law School, a group of vocal professors have rallied against Harvard’s approach to the issue, and even in some cases the government’s own interpretation of federal policy.
Undergraduate activists, Law School professors, and other affiliates all want Harvard, as a nationally renowned institution, to play a leadership role in redressing sexual violence—but there is no consensus about just what that should look like. The University, entangled between varying and at times oppositional voices, struggles to stand on neutral ground while accommodating its constituents.
University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, who worked at OCR before coming to Harvard, said she does not expect agreement on an issue as complicated as sexual violence and finds its necessary to hear differing views. But increasingly this year, Harvard, like other universities across the nation, seems all the more caught in between criticisms.
“In many ways, when you start to run a grievance process, you become the entity in the middle,” Lake said. “Often we find that what satisfies one interest is potentially against another.”
Although not strictly dichotomous, Law School professors and student activists have aired starkly divergent concerns over Title IX policy and implementation. Through the seemingly disparate visions, however, critics all seem to agree on the same guiding public strategy: visibly criticizing the University.
The difference in their visions but similarity in their strategies came through perhaps most clearly in debate over the University’s centralized investigatory office. Law School professors castigated ODR in public statements and communications to administrators, eventually circumventing the body entirely by creating separate Title IX procedures for their own school; at the same time, undergraduates pitched outside Lamont Library in a satirical bake sale demanding that the University amp up institutional support for the office, which was understaffed.
When it comes to the role of the federal government, parties also diverge. Some critics—most prominently the Law School professors who signed the Globe letter—lambast Harvard on the grounds that it should push back against the government’s interpretation of Title IX, which they consider flawed; other activists call on Harvard to proactively modify their policies to go above and beyond what the government requires. Undergraduates, by and large, speak not of faculty governance and federal regulatory jurisdiction, but of cultural forces. All parties, however, fault Harvard. 
Elizabeth Bartholet, a Law School professor who signed the Globe letter, said she wishes Harvard had taken more of a leadership role against the federal government, which she claims is pressuring universities to lead investigation processes that deny due process rights to the accused.
“I think the federal government is primarily at fault, if you will, but then I fault Harvard University for not taking a good look at what the the federal government was demanding, deciding on the merits whether it was good or bad, making the commitment to fight against those aspects that were being pushed that were in fact bad policy, and then performing a leadership role,” Bartholet said.
And while praising the University’s new policy, undergraduate and graduate activists then argue that Harvard is not doing enough. Instead of primarily lobbying for procedural changes, they hold that Harvard must bolster training, transparency, and consistency in resources for victims. In direct response to students, the Title IX office released additional information on the University’s policy this semester, but leaders of student activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better argue that more clarifying materials must be quickly released.
“Harvard has made all these statements in the past year and made all these surface level cosmetic changes to the policy, but in practice the way that they do things really hasn’t changed at all," said Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better.
SEEKING AN INTERSECTION
Pulled in different directions by its affiliates, it is essentially impossible for Harvard, activists and lawyers acknowledge, to satisfy all critics. But even with that reality, some call on Harvard to increase avenues for input on the issue to alleviate tensions.
“I think the University is pulled in a lot of different directions when it comes to trying to do the right thing,” Bruno said. “I think it's a good thing for them to be swayed by the public consciousness on their campus.”
Undergraduate organizers cautioned against extrapolating strong disagreement in values from the critical Law School professors, but argued that if the debate has shown anything, it is that Harvard needs to better consult all of its constituents.
“You might think that at core there is a disagreement in values that might be happening between, say, student activists and Law School professors, but I think that's an assumption that I would really push on, because we haven’t seen an open and honest discussion,” said Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17 of Our Harvard Can Do Better.
Janet E. Halley, one of the Law professors who signed the Globe letter and has played a leadership role in pushing for changes to the Law School’s Title IX procedures, also argued that engaging students is crucial.
“We really need to be walking towards the students and saying, 'What is this really about?'” Halley said.
Student activists also caution that the debate should not stall change: “Increased training and increased resources can be done regardless of where this debate over the policy stands,” said MaryRose Mazzola, a Kennedy School of Government student and organizer for Harvard Students Demand Respect, a graduate student group focused on sexual violence prevention.
For the time being, Karvonides and the University said they will continue to respond to concerns from various constituents. But Karvonides said she hopes next year will bring a new form of dissonance.
“I hope as we go into next year that some of the debate might be less polarized,” Karvonides said.

UPDATED: May 29, 2015, at 2:48 p.m.
Were it not for Harvard Law School professor Janet E. Halley, the national debate surrounding sexual assault on college campuses may well be in a markedly different place.
Last year, media and government attention to the issue surged as students across the country charged that their schools failed to support sexual assault victims and the federal government launched an unprecedented number of investigations into colleges’ compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
Harvard was among them. On the heels of this increasing federal scrutiny and pressure from student activists, the University adopted a new policy and set of procedures that overhauled its approach to handling sexual harassment. Lauded as a newly centralized approach to addressing a controversial issue, the new framework rolled out in the fall and was set to govern all of Harvard’s schools with consistency for years to come.
If, that is, Halley and some of her colleagues at the Law School had not had something to say about it.
Halley’s reaction to Harvard’s new sexual misconduct policy was not just disapproval; to the legal and feminist scholar, the issue at hand was more than just disgruntling bureaucratic decision making. Harvard’s—and the government’s—approach to adjudicating campus sexual harassment, Halley believes, represented an inconsolable breach from the principles of due process and an alarming example of some feminist principles taken too far.
Her position on the contentious issue has its roots in her career as a scholar of both the law and of sexuality.
Halley believes in feminism, but throughout her career, she has pushed against orthodoxy and remained critical of what she sees as the consequences of some of its tenets. And now she is pushing against Harvard’s position on Title IX: Last fall, she took to the forefront of the Harvard Law School faculty’s charge to challenge the University’s approach to the issue, penning memos, conceiving open letters, and mobilizing her colleagues to take a public stance. That push has precipitated not only a change in conversation, but a major break from the vision of Harvard’s central administration.
Halley’s plunge into Harvard politics has changed a swirling campus and nationwide policy debate characterized by institutions of higher education struggling to keep up with increasingly demanding Title IX standards. Not without critics, she is vying not only for a change in policy at Harvard but also for a shift in conversation at the Law School, the University, and the country at large.
“When I read the University policy last July, I said to one of my colleagues at the Law School who works with me on these things, ‘You know we have to change the weather,’” Halley recalled.
A California native, Halley’s engagement with feminism—a relationship that has characterized her academic career—began during her days as a student. She graduated summa cum laude with the second class of women from Princeton, earned her Ph.D. in English literature from the University of California at Los Angeles, and became a literature professor at Hamilton College around the time it went coeducational. During the integration of those two formerly all-male institutions, Halley said the “flourishing” feminist thought of the time played an important role in her experiences.

Over time, she said, she started to engage with her views on feminism critically and “regard feminism as an alternative, not as a religion,” and she would go on to explore this concept in her scholarship.
Halley described her beliefs in a recent phone interview succinctly: “I'm a leftist, and I'm a crit, but that means for me, hetereosexual men are just as important as lesbian feminists, and I don't care about one identity group more than another. I sympathize with the justice aspirations of all kinds of people,” Halley said.
Since leaving her post at Hamilton, attending Yale Law School, and teaching law at Stanford, where she advised sexual harassment complainants, Halley has maintained this often-times critical bent. A cursory glance at some of her scholarship—of her books, she is most proud of 2006’s “Split Decisions: How and Why To Take a Break From Feminism”—demonstrates her critical approach to the topic.
“She embraces the ways that feminism can sometimes conflict with itself, and she sees that as a strength and not a weakness,” said Rebecca N. Chapman, a third-year Harvard Law student who has taken class with Halley and served as her research assistant.
Today, the Title IX debate has pushed Halley to make what she calls a “shift” in her career to enter not only academic conversations on the topic but a concrete policy debate. To Halley, the debate about sexual assault on college campuses represents what she argues is too much of a focus on women as victims that advances “an image of women that really forgets the power that women have” while simultaneously failing to offer necessary protection for the accused. She is also concerned that the absence of what she considers proper due process would disproportionately hurt minorities involved in proceedings.
“It kind of continues her trajectory of pushing people who are engaged in feminist activism on the topic of sexual assault, and on the topic of sex and sexuality, to think hard about the consequences of their actions, and the consequences those actions might have on other people,” said Aziza Ahmed, an associate law professor at Northeastern who was previously a student of Halley’s.
Although much of Halley’s career has been marked by her willingness to take controversial stances on a range of issues, she generally shies from the limelight and sensationalism; ask her a question, and there is a long, measured pause before she answers. But when Harvard unveiled its new Title IX policy last year, she felt that she had no choice but to respond.
“I felt: this is right in my backyard. I’ve been working on this for years,” Halley said. “This is making all kinds of mistakes I’ve been writing about. I can’t just stand by—that would be discontinuous with the commitment I’ve made in my scholarship and teaching to just let this go by without making an objection.”
Her colleagues are not surprised.
“She is in the business of telling the truth about things that other people have an incentive either not to see or not to say,” said Jeannie C. Suk, a Law professor at Harvard who said she attended law school because of Halley’s work and was later her student. “More than anyone else that I have worked with, she has that ability to do it in a way where people will listen.”
While Halley says her campaign against Harvard’s Title IX policy and procedures is unusual for her, the movement to break from the University’s centralized sexual harassment policy, which she helped spearhead, is even more so.
A loud challenge to an unprecedented central University policymaking decision, Halley’s efforts are emblematic of the fervor with which many Law School professors oppose Harvard’s new Title IX approach and their genuine belief that it violates legal principles they consider fundamental. To Halley and her colleagues, when Harvard adopted the approach last year, something was going to have to change.
And according to many Law School professors, Halley’s efforts to effect this change were all but essential.
In September, Halley wrote a critical analysis of Harvard’s new framework, arguing that it was “defective on every known scale of equal procedural treatment of the parties and due process.” Halley sent her analysis to the entire Law School faculty and directly to some of Harvard’s top central administrators—University President Drew G. Faust, University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83, and University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides—to begin a dialogue with Massachusetts Hall that would later involve the rest of the Law School faculty.
 According to Halley’s colleagues, that analysis was an important first step in mobilizing the Law School faculty to push for change. “I think that analysis just proved enormously important in terms of educating the entire Harvard Law School faculty,” said Elizabeth Bartholet, another Law School professor who worked with Halley and several colleagues to lead the effort to bring the issue to the faculty’s attention.
After Halley’s initial analysis, one of several on the policy that were ultimately circulated among the Law School faculty, a group of professors met with Harvard’s general counsel to discuss possible changes to the new policy and procedures. When that meeting proved unsuccessful in prompting immediate policy change, the professors decided to make their concerns public.
In October, a group of 28 Law School professors—including Halley, Suk, and Bartholet—published an open letter in The Boston Globe that sharply criticized Harvard’s Title IX approach, like Halley’s initial analysis, on the grounds that it was unfair to the accused; among other points, it argued that Harvard's central Title IX office, which both investigates complaints and determines whether or not policy violations have occurred, was not structurally impartial, and criticized the process's lack of an adversary hearing. It also charged that it failed to guarantee "adequate representation for the accused, particularly for students unable to afford representation" and that Harvard's definition of sexual harassment "goes significantly beyond Title IX and Title VII law."
According to Law School colleague and co-signatory Charles J. Ogletree, the idea for the letter originated with Halley.
Their efforts saw results. In wake of this widespread faculty pushback, Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow appointed a committee to craft a set of Title IX procedures specific to the Law School. Halley, in conjunction with 19 other professors who signed the Globe letter, circulated a memo to the full faculty in November, lobbying for the Law School to break from Harvard’s centralized procedures.

The committee ultimately proposed a set of procedures that closely resembled what Halley and her colleagues requested: It featured an independent adjudicatory body and attorneys guaranteed to both parties in a case, formally circumventing the central investigatory body that was then responsible for hearing complaints filed against all students at Harvard.
“The tide was going the other way, and people around the state and around the country wanted to make sure, following Title IX, that women could find the kind of support they needed at universities,” Ogletree said. “And the record around the country was not a very positive one. And so she was going against the grain when she took on this issue, and the reality is that she made the Harvard faculty think really hard about it.”
While Halley and her colleagues’ position has drawn praise from some law professors, it is not without its critics. Karvonides maintains that Harvard’s policy is neutral, and Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, argued that the Law professors’ position involves “a lot of confusion and a lot of overstepping from the criminal system into the civil system.”
Closer to home, Stephanie E. Davidson, who was president of the Harvard Women’s Law Association before graduating from the Law School in 2013, responded to the Globe letter alongside other alumni with an op-ed in The Crimson. Davidson argues that the professors’ stance is insensitive to the needs of sexual assault victims.
“We felt pretty betrayed by our former professors,” Davidson said.
With Harvard Law School’s new Title IX procedures in the implementation stage, Halley continues to call for what amounts to a paradigm shift in the way Harvard and the federal government approach Title IX compliance.
Halley maintains that she will not stop her push while her concerns about the sexual assault debate remain, and her continued involvement has taken her to the pages of the Harvard Law Review and other schools around the country to advance her argument. In February, Halley explored the adjudication of college sexual assault complaints, and again criticized Harvard’s Title IX office, in a piece in the Harvard Law Review.
She has also visited Roanoke College, the University of Chicago, and Hamilton College to discuss Title IX compliance; at Hamilton, she met with the College’s president and Title IX officials to help review their Title IX framework, according to Frank Anechiarico, a professor there. They may call her for future advice this summer as they revise the policy, Anechiarico said. 
“She is definitely one of the top experts and perhaps the foremost leader of the pushback that’s been going on this past year against the sexual misconduct policies that have all been crafted in response” to the federal government’s recent Title IX guidance, said Gerald McDermott, a professor at Roanoke.
Back at Harvard, the debate about sexual assault continues. Although the federal government found Harvard Law School in violation of Title IX in December and is now working with the school on its new procedures, an investigation at the College is ongoing, and student activists there continue to seek more administrative support for victims. Halley and her colleagues, meanwhile, seek broader policy change as they continue conversations with administrators about the University’s Title IX approach.
Although she declined to offer specifics in an interview last week, Halley alluded to possible change in the future. “There are lots of conversations going on about it now,” she said, “and I think they will be productive."
Halley envisions a new national landscape on the issue, in which a diverse group of people—“politically and generationally and in terms of their relationship to feminism”—think about the sexual assault debate critically.
“When that’s true all over the place, maybe one day I get to let this go,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council considered an act sharply condemning Harvard’s all-male final clubs at a contentious meeting in March. The legislation and its attached position paper came amidst a wave of controversy on campus regarding the clubs after the Spee Club sent out a controversial party invitation to students including what some viewed as sexist depictions of women.
After embarking on an hour of debate, the Council ultimately voted down the measure, leaving the UC without a position on a topical campus issue.
Such an action is not a typical one for Harvard’s student government: The meeting marked the first time since November that the Council voted down a piece of legislation. During the past academic year, only three out of 57 Council acts on which representatives took a vote were not approved; many of them passed unanimously.
Some representatives defend the sheer number of up-votes, arguing that it is a byproduct of the Council’s reliance in committees to vet legislation before it comes before the entire body. But others point out that the bulk of the legislation that the Council considers—grant funding for student groups, statements of solidarity—is not controversial and actionable, making it easy for representatives to simply say “aye.” These representatives raise concerns that this trend suggests that the Council is not allocating its attention appropriately. Instead, these representatives argue, the UC is opting to shy away from taking bolder stances on controversial issues with relevance to student life, turning its focus to smaller internal initiatives and student group funding.
GETTING TO A YES
The Council holds in its coffers nearly half a million dollars to spend every year, the vast majority of which is allocated to student groups seeking funding for their activities. Though widely considered both inside and outside the Council the most important mandate of the UC, this appropriation of funds is not debated by the entire Council in detail at its general meetings. The specifics are usually hashed out weekly by its Finance Committee, the group of representatives responsible for funding.
The UC carries much of its work out this way. The Council has four other primary committees like its Finance Committee, all meeting weekly to meticulously discuss the legislation and initiatives that fall under their purview.
“Committees give a better environment for debate in a small setting,” UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said.
This system of considering legislation in committees first is intentional; according to UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, the Council prefers that legislation go through committees to make sure it is “tightened up” before reaching the floor.
Once there, legislation is usually passed by unanimous consent, which former UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said is indicative of the Council’s faith in its committee structure. “We trust them to make a good decision; unanimous voting is a symbol of that trust,” said Goffard, adding that representatives are “skeptical” when pieces of legislation are not vetted by committees.
Biebelberg, for his part, criticized the use of unanimous consent. The use of unanimous consent allows legislation to be passed after only two representatives speak in favor of it; as long as no member objects, the legislation passes without a vote of the full Council. Biebelberg said its use may discourage freshmen and other new members from expressing dissenting opinions and that unanimous consent can often allow things to “pass by quickly” with little discussion.
NO CONTROVERSY
But although it contributes, representatives say that the UC’s committee system cannot alone explain the body’s lack of expressed dissent. Some forms of the legislation that are brought before the UC consist of material which Biebelberg called “by its nature, uncontroversial.”
“Just by virtue of the things that we do, there’s not always room or need for excessive debate,” he said.
Biebelberg added that the approval of things like endorsements and budgetary items are more “business-oriented and administrative” than thought-provoking. Dudley House representative Zachary W. Popp ’15, who sponsored the third failed legislative act this year, went further, calling UC legislation “unimportant” at times.
Popp’s legislation asked the UC to allow environmental activist group Divest Harvard to publicize “Heat Week,” its April protest of Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies that involved a weeklong blockade of Massachusetts Hall, over the Council’s email list that reaches all undergraduates. The Council voted down the measure, with several representatives arguing that they were reluctant to give what they saw as “implicit” support of Heat Week and the divestment movement.
The Council’s hesitance contrasts with the strong support the UC offered in fall 2012, when the Council passed legislation sponsored by now-UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 that the Council would “partner with...Divest Harvard to actively pursue its goals.” Three years later, Goyal voted against Popp’s legislation.
Earlier this semester, the UC similarly hesitated to support the act authored by Winthrop House representative and Crimson news writer Daniel R. Levine ’17 that condemned final clubs. The position paper that accompanied the act said many undergraduates view the clubs as “a thinly-veiled mechanism for elite, male students to exploit power dynamics and get laid.” Representatives scorned the act for its harsh language and voted it down.
ABSTAINING FROM A STANCE
That vote was a departure for the UC. Cabot House representative Luke R. Heine ’17, who voted against the measure, said controversial legislation that takes a strong stance like the final clubs act is rare for the Council.
“That was a great example of what the UC could be in its best times,” said Heine, calling the act “bold” and “courageous.”
Even on other concerns raised by the student body, such as the administration’s decision to shift the purview of the Bureau of Study Counsel from Harvard University Health Services to the College, the Council has failed to take a concrete stand. Instead of expressing disapproval or approval of the College’s decision, the UC merely asked administrators to provide documents that would explain how they came to their decision.
Some representatives, such as Heine, say that the Council should be looking to discuss more controversial topics and take stronger stances on issues. Popp said that beyond the weekly student group grants approved by the Council, legislation is mainly immaterial.
“I would love to have the UC more actively using their…powers to reach parts of the student body,” he said.
Still, other representatives contend that voting in support of smaller pieces of legislation and not taking strong stances on controversial issues is simply the nature of a student government.
“The UC tends to want to accommodate people’s perspectives, so we tend to up-vote a lot of things,” Council Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 said. “I think people want a lot of things from a student government, so they expect it to be a forum where a lot of profound things happen.”
Biebelberg said despite this possible expectation from the student body, the Council does not have to change what it votes on and considers.
“We should not take ourselves more seriously than people think we should,” Biebelberg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of rehearsal, countless lost hours of sleep, and perhaps a missed lecture or two, scores of undergraduates step on stage each semester to debut in student-run productions, just one of the ways many Harvard students spend their time outside of the classroom.
Yet for the first time in the school’s history, participating in such a student-run extracurricular activity will cease to be separate from some students’ academic life. It will fulfill a concentration requirement.
Earlier this semester, members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences bridged the gap between academia and extracurricular life when they approved a new undergraduate concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media, one of many recent efforts to promote the arts at Harvard. Concentrators will be required to take to the stage in four performing arts productions. Two must be departmental shows, but two may be produced by student-run groups.
This new concentration follows discussions by administrators and professors, some of whom over the years have insisted that students should focus on their coursework—not their extracurricular activities.a
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has discussed student-run organizations on campus and concerns about their growing prominence. In an email in the fall of 2014, Khurana cited senior survey data from 2010, 2011, and 2013 showing that students spend more and more time on their extracurricular activities. Former Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister said that over the past decade, the College’s club list has grown by more than 100.
But as the College readies to launch its new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration, a grey area between academics and student-run clubs and organizations has begun to emerge.
Indeed, some faculty members identify the concentration as an effort to formalize and validate the extensive time students spend on the performing arts outside of the classroom. Some of those students, too, said they both value their involvement in extracurricular groups and support the new concentration, making the curricular-extracurricular distinctions all the more fuzzy.
“Student involvement outside the classroom should be purposefully educational, so it is great to see involvement opportunities that span the extra-curricular and the curricular,” Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote in an email.
STAGE TO PAGE AND BACK AGAIN
As the College launches its first performing arts concentration, faculty and administrators have incorporated student-run productions into the concentration curriculum in an effort to support the groups and emphasize hands-on learning.
“There’s such a strong extracurricular culture, and we wanted to build on that and preserve that, but also make sure that there would be a sort of give and take between that and the new concentration,” said English professor Martin Puchner, who formally proposed the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration in the fall of 2012.
To fulfill one of the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration’s requirements, students may count two performances produced by student-run groups, though these productions will not count towards the 32 half-courses required to obtain an undergraduate degree. Some faculty members said they recognized the time students spend working in performing arts organizations on campus.
“There’s been consistent demand by students to get...recognition and credit in a way for the incredible energy and time and thought that a lot of students have brought to theater,” Puchner said. “So it seemed only natural to create a concentration.”
“It was the desire to find a space where the entrepreneurial independent theater-making that has always been so strong at Harvard could be supported, so we didn’t want a concentration that separated the extracurricular theater making so drastically that it would feel at a loss,” said Diana Sorensen, FAS’s dean of arts and humanities. “Letting students count some of that towards the concentration seemed like the right balance.”
Administrators and professors suggest that given the subject material of the concentration, involvement in the production process constitutes an essential learning experience. “Participation in performing arts productions, whether curricular or extracurricular, will provide opportunities to deepen the intellectual study of the various art forms,” Friedrich wrote.
Jack Megan, the director of Harvard’s Office for the Arts, emphasized that the performance requirement serves as a key way to inform concentrators’ academic work. He said the program intends for coursework and out-of-class performances to work in tandem.
“[The program] is going to be integrated, so there will be movement from the curricular into the extracurricular,” Megan said.
A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
Concentration architects are not the only ones excited about the blending of extracurricular life and academia—leaders of these groups believe the change will help their clubs gain resources and momentum.
Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club President Magdalene M. Zier ’16 said HRDC overall is “very, very excited” about the new concentration and hopes that it will not fragment theater on campus but incentivize students to join club productions instead.
“I think it will definitely bolster participation in shows,” Zier said. “We all spend so many hours a week doing this stuff, and getting academic credit as well will only help.”
The process of auditioning for shows, called Common Casting, for a long time has been organized, publicized, and managed by students. With Theater, Dance, and Media concentrators’ ability to partake in HRDC productions, club leaders and concentration coordinators have been discussing potential overlap.
Those involved in student-run productions hope to benefit from the College’s funding and hiring professionals for the concentration.

“What we’re really hoping is that there is going to be an outpouring of resources and support from the administration, who have expressed that that is certainly going to be the case, so we are really excited to work with them,” said Jake S. Stepansky ’17, an HRDC board member who coordinates shows in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
These resources include structured professional feedback and exposure for concentrators, according to Ryan S. McKittrick, the director of artistic programs and dramaturg at the American Repertory Theater.
Despite the increase in some resources, the new concentration will share much of the same spaces currently used by student-run shows, a concern that designers of the concentration have voiced.
“We don’t want to compromise the extracurricular opportunities,” Megan said.
Some students still are optimistic about the overlap. “What has been great is that the administration and faculty have been very forthcoming about their plans, and very positive, and excited about what this concentration is going to mean in terms of space usage,” Stepansky said.
[EXTRA]CURRICULARS
Still, Theater, Dance, and Media represents only part of a broader discussion about the convergence of the academic and extracurricular lives of students at the College. Across the board, faculty and administrators have said now that the binary picture of academia versus extracurricular life is not as distinct as it largely has been painted.
Although Khurana said the academic component of a student’s life at the College is critical, he also said that in the future both curricular and out-of-the-classroom aspects of their lives can merge.
“Moving forward, we hope to continue to build a supportive environment where students can integrate their academic, social, and personal choices in ways that reinforce that important goal,” Khurana wrote in an email.
While the incorporation of student-run productions in the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration curriculum is in many ways new, there already do exist some blurred lines between academia and activities that take place outside of the classroom.
Participation in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, which is led by a faculty member, earns students course credit towards their diploma graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis, according to HRO President Aaron Z. Roper ’16.
“[Academic recognition is] a big acknowledgment of all the hard work we do, and the fact that we are working with a faculty member means that it is supervised, a more structured environment than just a typical extracurricular activity,” Roper said.
Navigating middle ground comes with its own set of challenges, however, and earlier this spring HRO Director Federico Cortese and senior lecturer in the Music department pointed to limitations of preserving some extracurricular aspects of the orchestra.
“If we decide that the faculty/conductor model is what we want to have, we have to push it all the way and make these groups rigorous, selective, and evaluated on stringent and strict criteria,” Cortese said. “Hence, grades.”
But for thousands of students involved in hundreds of other extracurricular activities next year, the time and effort they spend outside of the classroom will not fulfill any academic requirements, even though many said that non-coursework constitutes an important part of their education.
Ross C. Svenson ’15, a Government concentrator, participated in the Harvard Democrats and programs at the Institute of Politics throughout his time as an undergraduate. Svenson said his experiences enhanced the course material he studied in his Government classes, though he never fulfilled academic requirements for the time he spent and the work he did for extracurricular activities.
“I think people derive a lot of enjoyment and learn a lot of practical skills…in those extracurricular organizations,” Svenson said. “I think [connecting extracurriculars and academics] would help the College’s problem with student overcommitment to extracurriculars.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 7, 2015, at 1:31 p.m.
As more universities look to expand their influence abroad, Harvard might appear to be falling behind.
In recent years, several of Harvard’s peer institutions have built overseas campuses or schools jointly run with international partners. Examples include Yale-NUS College in Singapore (2011); Duke-Kunshan University in China (2014); and New York University’s campuses in Abu Dhabi (2010) and Shanghai (2013).
Meanwhile, University President Drew G. Faust has been firm that Harvard will not establish undergraduate campuses abroad. But this does not mean the University has stopped pursuing global footholds. Rather, Harvard maintains a significant global presence through 16 officially recognized overseas offices and dozens more programs organized by specific schools.
Three more centers—in Cape Town, Beijing, and Mumbai—were recently approved and are in various stages of development. Indeed, while Harvard may not have an undergraduate campus abroad, administrators say the system of international offices and school-run programs has allowed the University nimbly to expand its international presence while avoiding the restrictions and barriers that come with channeling resources into a single foreign campus.
HOME AWAY FROM HOME
Harvard’s offices abroad serve as outposts for University programming, teaching, and research efforts. From hosting speaker series to assisting research and travel planning to coordinating with alumni, the offices help Harvard extend its reach without needing to commit the amount of resources necessary for an international campus.
“We try to bring the best of Harvard to India, and we try to bring the best of India to Harvard,” said Namrata Arora, associate director of the South Asia Institute’s office in Mumbai, separate from the University-wide Mumbai center that was approved earlier this year.
A Harvard center in Shanghai is another example of its embassy approach to international presence. The facility is equipped with classrooms, a multipurpose space, nine conference rooms, offices, 17 full-time staff, and a student intern. Besides hosting various events and Harvard Business School’s executive education courses, the center also helps with the recruitment of Chinese applicants to Harvard College, and is used by the Business School as a space to conduct admission interviews in the region. In the past four months, the center has held 16 events that were participated by more than 1,200 people, according to Jing Huang, the center’s managing executive director.
“The feel is very Harvard-like… Harvard Center Shanghai is an ambassador of Harvard to China,” Huang said.
The offices give the University the ability to change and adapt its overseas engagements as it sees fit. All start-ups are inherently risky, and start-up schools are no exception, said Jorge Dominguez, Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs. When things do not work, closing down a center—which has happened with Harvard’s centers in Moscow and Berlin—is much easier than closing down a university.
“I think having that flexibility is very valuable. We’ve done it in a way that gives us the best bang for our buck,” said Todd Washburn, an assistant provost for international affairs. Washburn added that establishing offices, instead of partnering with local universities, allows Harvard to collaborate with a whole variety of international partners instead of “playing favorites” and choosing any one in particular.
The structure of the offices has also, so far, helped Harvard largely avoid the faculty resistance that has developed around international efforts at other schools.
“There’s a lot of inertia in great academic institutions, and it’s natural for faculty to say: ‘Why are you rocking this boat? Why should you try something different?’” said NYU Shanghai Vice Chancellor Jeffrey S. Lehman, who said that reception among NYU faculty to the new venture was mixed at first.
But for Harvard, the office strategy allows for a great deal of flexibility in opening and closing locations, and allows for broader presence without the University having to choose a single location, said Fernando M. Reimers, a professor at the Graduate School of Education who specializes in global education.
Harvard’s Connecticut cousin, though, made the more permanent decision by opening a campus abroad, Dominguez said, singling out Yale-NUS, a college jointly run by Yale and National University and Singapore.
“I do not understand why Yale has done what it did. They have massive expenses, narrowly defined degree programs, they are under-demanded and receive many fewer applications than they had planned,” Dominguez said.
STREAMLINING AND ADAPTING
Over the past 15 years, Harvard has centralized its management of overseas operations, in part to relieve the logistical burden on faculty and students as they conduct their research.
Harvard has had international activities for at least 150 years. In the 19th century, professors who wanted to conduct research overseas often went with soldiers, and were on their own to learn about the laws and customs of their destination country, according to Joseph Levy, the director of Harvard’s Global Support Services.
For most of this time, the University president had little knowledge and oversight of Harvard’s international activities. This state of affairs changed through a string of efforts in the last 15 years intended to enhance oversight and provide support for faculty and students who wanted to venture abroad, according to Levy. These include the creation of the University Committee on International Projects and Sites in 2006, the creation of the vice provost for international affairs in 2006, and the establishment of Global Support Services in 2011.
If Harvard’s international footprint is relatively decentralized, as Washburn said, central University resources play an increasingly major role when affiliates travel abroad, to the centers and elsewhere.
Global Support Services is an example of a centralized office which has sought to lower or erase those barriers. The four-year-old-office provides pre-travel information on safety risks and local laws and works with external partners to provide on-the-ground support to affiliates in need. Recently, Global Support Services helped extract Harvard affiliates from Nepal after a crushing earthquake.
“Certainly, our office didn’t exist 10 years ago, and you could argue that this is evidence of centralization,” Washburn said. The push for “One Harvard” has increased the connectedness of these international offices and has established administrative support services, such as GSS and the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs, to encourage the deepening of offices’ abilities, as well as the creation of new offices.
“To me it’s about lowering barriers for our faculty and students to pursue their research and education interests, and to not let the hurdle of logistics stand in the way of pursuing research interests,” Washburn said.
Washburn added that his office allows center development to occur at an accelerated pace, without being dictated by Harvard’s central administrators.
“A center or a school that wants to open a physical presence, an office if you will, comes to us when they’re ready,” Washburn said. “I think that’s a smart way to approach it, rather than the President of the university proclaiming an office in city X, Y, and Z—Harvard is enormously decentralized and always has been.”
Dominguez said that when he became the University’s first vice provost for international affairs about a decade ago, the average time it took for a proposal on global engagement to be approved was two years. Now, it is at most six months.
“The difference between then and now is that now there is now a thoughtful process, by colleagues, not by some administrative fiat…and you get good advice and a quicker decision,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Interim Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has been in the position since January, has briefly led Harvard’s tech and science hub during a $450 million capital campaign and the planning phase for the its relocation across the Charles River to Allston in 2019. He sat down with The Crimson to discuss fundraising, computer science, and SEAS’s move to Allston before new dean Francis Doyle, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, takes the helm in August.
The Harvard Crimson: Reflecting on your time in the position this semester, as interim Dean of SEAS, what were your strategies for fundraising and priorities this semester for the school?
Harry R. Lewis: I’ve been trying to reconnect to alumni that I’ve known. This is my 41st year on the faculty. I’ve actually also been talking to people that I was in college and grad school with, so I’ve been seeing people over really a 50-year span of Harvard classes. A bunch of people I knew, a bunch of people I’m meeting for the first time. …
I tell them it’s very simple. I tell them that all of the areas of applied science are exploding at Harvard. … We’re drawing on all the richness of the undergraduate population, and we are doing world-changing scientific research. Some things are going to have enormous consequences on energy and biomedicine and robotics, and some things are going to improve the quality of human life.
Then I talk about the promised land, as I call it, on the other side of the river and the excitement of SEAS getting to go to and be kind of the anchor store of developing the vast tract of underdeveloped land within the city of Boston… I try to get people to understand the importance of what is happening as SEAS grows and expands…. We’re at the beginning of something huge here.

THC: So what do you think will be the most challenging part of SEAS move to Allston?
HRL: It’s a very large building project, and it’s a combination of wet labs and dry labs and office space, so its a costly project. It’s a complicated project, so getting it as right as we can get it from the planning standpoint, given that we’re talking about how science is going to be done, how teaching is going to be done four years from now. You know a lot of us are changing our teaching styles. Now there’s a lot more with the classroom and interactive and less lecturing. So you’ve got to say to the faculty, how do you want to teach your courses four years from now? So those are hard decisions but they really impact the design, as to how many, you know, lecture halls. So in the short run that’s going to be very challenging.
I’m not at all worried about the connectedness questions which have troubled some people. … I’m not worried about attracting students to go down there as long as the building is lively and fun and comfortable.
THC: A couple years ago, you were one of the coauthors of a white paper that outlined visions and hopes for the design and the use of space, and I’m wondering how this white paper and the components that you and your colleagues outlined in it have shaped your work this semester in SEAS?
HRL: It’s been in the background. There have been lots of discussions going on between the architects and the faculty and other parties, you know, food services, librarians, and all the rest throughout the semester. I actually have not been an integral member of those discussions because I’m only interim, and so other faculty who have been assigned that on a longer term basis have been more central to the discussions. … I haven’t heard any challenge to the concept.… The fundamental idea is that we, the faculty, will go to our new campus, and that’s where we’ll do all our work, and that’s where the students will see us.
THC: There’s half of SEAS that’s not moving, which consists of departments like applied math, environmental science, engineering. Do you see there will potentially be a disconnect between these areas and the Allston?
HRL: No, we’ll make that work. ... You know, through some combination of technology and scheduling. It’s all still somewhat up in the air. ... This is probably not the last building to be built on that side of the river.

THC: Related to that last point, how do you think the roles as dean of the College and dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are similar? And in what ways, at least with you, have they been different?
HRL: I’ve thought about that a lot. You know, in one way they’re very similar because the first principle is that people matter more than structure. People think that you solve problems by having [to] report to someone else, and all of a sudden your problems are going to be solved... It depends on the quality of the people. … Getting people to buy into the idea that they’re here doing something important and that we’re in the future’s business; we’re in the business of changing the future of the world and creating the future for our students.
There’s many ways in which these two jobs have nothing to do with each other. I’d never hired a faculty member before, even when I was kind of leading the CS part of the school... These are all kinds of new conversations, all the business side of hiring faculty. There’ve been huge challenges here because we have been growing so quickly that we’re out of space. We’re spread across 17 buildings. Every coat closet is now pretty much in use, and we’re continuing to hire.
THC: What do you think SEAS needs the most currently, besides space?
HRL: Money. We’re expanding much more rapidly than our resources can support, frankly. That’s a critical resource. That’s why they keep flying me to California and Seattle and New York, and why I think it’s important for alumni and Harvard in general. … So we need the resources and we need the resources to support what we’re doing now and to keep, continue to do what we’re doing to meet the demands that are upon us. This is the best possible problem to have. I’m very proud that we’ve created this problem for ourselves, that our enrollments are growing.
THC: Now, looking at the recently appointed dean [Francis Doyle]… one point we’re interested in is that the new SEAS dean comes from outside the University. What do you think his adjustment period will look like, especially since we’re in the midst of a such a large capital campaign, and how do you think he can best try to connect with donors he may not have known before?
HRL: I don’t know him personally; I was not a part of the search process. Everyone says wonderful things about him. I’m really looking forward to getting to know him and helping him make the transition. The previous two deans before me were also new to Harvard. … Look what’s happened. … I don’t think there’s any intrinsic reason why he should have any problem keeping the school moving forward and connecting to alumni who are eager to hear the story we tell. The anecdotes are personal but the visions are exactly the same that SEAS has had for a decade now or more.
THC: What are your plans for after you step down?
HRL: I’m just going to go back to being a professor then. I never stopped being a professor—I kept teaching my course CS20, same as when I was Dean of the College. I never stopped teaching. It’s so important to me. … I’m going to go back in the fall, CS121, undergrad theory course. I wanted to again offer my freshman seminar, "Amateur Athletics." I will again become director of undergraduate studies in CS, which I gave up for the term—that’s the one thing I gave up that I stopped doing. I’ll just pick up what I was doing last fall.
THC: What is your proudest achievement?
HRL: I don’t know. I haven’t had time to think of that. That I managed to get to most of my classes. … I relied on my head TF a lot this term so he really gets more credit than I do for teaching this class... but I was at most classes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences filed into University Hall’s Faculty Room in May to discuss a critical report on the College’s General Education program at their last meeting of the year, most were unsurprised to hear that the core curriculum of the one of the world’s leading colleges was “failing on a variety of fronts.”
The program suffers from a lack of identity; includes courses that are often too large and indistinguishable from their departmental counterparts; and faces difficulties in preparing teaching fellows to instruct its courses effectively, according to the committee charged with reviewing it. Notably blunt, the report listed many “misgivings” about the program from faculty and students.
Faculty members who came to discuss the program, which generally constitutes a quarter of students’ undergraduate course loads, were prepared with remarks. Some expounded upon the philosophy of General Education; others listed the dangers of distribution requirements and including departmental courses in the curriculum. Still others voiced frustration with what they described as serious problems with an endeavor that had been billed as Harvard’s academic cornerstone and spanned years of contentious debate.
It was clear by the end of the meeting that the Faculty has months more of debate ahead. But tellingly, those most involved with the program, from instructors to administrators, expressed no surprise with any of the report’s findings.
Looking back, they say, Gen Ed seemed doomed to its fate, a victim of the administrative and financial uncertainty that gripped Harvard during its implementation. Yet beyond that, some of the program’s woes are manifestations of structural problems within Harvard’s system of undergraduate education, suffering from many of the same problems it was intended to fix.
CORE PROBLEMS
Despite nearly four years of deliberation, a working group, a committee, and a task force, the very problems that the designers of the Gen Ed program intended to allay are the ones plaguing it today.
From the beginning, the Program in General Education was intended to be the cornerstone of a renewed undergraduate educational experience at Harvard College, the goal of the curricular review championed by former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former FAS Dean William C. Kirby. They set out to modernize Harvard’s undergraduate education, targeting among many other things the College’s version of Gen Ed at the time, the Core, which was crafted under then-University President Derek C. Bok and his FAS Dean, Henry Rosovsky, nearly three-decades prior.
The Core “failed to respect the many changes in knowledge that had taken place since its establishment in the 1970s,” Summers said in an interview last week. In April 2004, committee work and faculty discussion resulted in a 67-page review of the Core, which in turn launched further committees, conversations, and reports on how to replace the aging framework.
But more than 11 years later, many of the same problems have reappeared in the Core’s replacement. Reports on both programs found that the criteria for approving courses is opaque; the programs’ missions are unclear to both faculty and students; it channels students into large courses; and the courses are often too easy. Instead, undergraduates should take courses that are broader and more foundational, both groups recommended.

Yet despite the similarities in problems between the two systems, administrators worked extensively to improve on the design of the Core before launching the Gen Ed program. A Committee on General Education of about two dozen members, chaired by Kirby and Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 and featuring Summers, for a time, as an ex-officio member, was organized to craft a more concrete proposal in 2004.
That group’s large size was a detriment, English professor Louis Menand said, who sat on the committee, which met weekly in the fall of 2004. He likened the committee’s work to “herding cats” because of its size. Eventually, a smaller group of five professors crafted the final report that they presented to the Faculty in November 2005.
The final Curricular Renewal report—a 131-page and legacy-defining creation for Summers and Kirby, according to faculty members—was released in January 2006. It included the findings of the committee.
“All we could come up with was distribution requirements,” Menand said. That proposed program would require students to complete courses spread over three subject areas: arts and humanities, the study of societies, and science and technology.
Yet despite the preparatory work, this recommendation was not ultimately approved by the full Faculty, who criticized it for lacking a guiding vision and generating little enthusiasm for the new program. Coupled with a crippling financial crisis and major administrative turnover, Gen Ed was off to a slow start.
ONE PROGRAM, THREE ADMINISTRATIONS
Shortly after the Curricular Renewal report was released, Kirby announced his resignation amid a deeply divided administration. Weeks after that, facing sharp faculty criticism, Summers announced that he, too, would be leaving his post. And with that, the men who spearheaded the creation of Gen Ed ended their primary administrative ties, leaving the program in a lurch.
Psychology professor Steven Pinker, who sat on the Gen Ed Committee of 2004 and 2005, attributed the its lackluster final product not to size but to the lack of leadership from Summers as his relationship with the Faculty deteriorated throughout 2005.

“The process was leaderless,” Pinker wrote in an email, “and a committee of any size that embraced both postmodernists and scientists was bound to come up with a bland common denominator that no one could get excited about and everyone saw as fair game for horse-trading and pork-barreling.”
Thus, while the idea for the Gen Ed program initially formed under Summers’s administration, legislation detailing the curriculum’s specifics came under two interim administrators, Bok—who returned for a brief stint as University president in July 2006—and Jeremy R. Knowles, who took over temporarily as FAS dean.
In the first weeks of their tenure, a task force was created in response to the lack of faculty enthusiasm for the original proposal and the delays caused by the administrative chaos of the previous six months. Menand and Philosophy professor Alison Simmons, also on the previous committee, led the small task force as it crafted the new proposal under the interim administration.
The group released its final proposal in early 2007, and after the efforts of several groups, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences officially approved the new Program in General Education in May.
But just two months later, a new administration took over when Drew G. Faust began her tenure as University president and Michael D. Smith stepped in as the next FAS dean, leaving the program in their hands to bring from paper into classrooms around Harvard Yard.
In the span of three years, Gen Ed had become one administration’s to contemplate, another’s to legislate, and yet another’s to implement—a crippling combination.
“A little bit of the difficulty was that the people who had to administer the program didn’t own it,” Menand said, “and I think that’s probably understandable.”
“I don’t think Drew Faust could come in with the authority in this particular area that could let her say, ‘This is how we’re going to do it; this is how it would make sense,’” said History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, who sat on the 2004-2005 Gen Ed Committee and is a former Crimson editorial chair. “This clearly was Larry’s.”
The newly-minted Standing Committee on General Education was charged with implementing a new program in one year, a rapid transition, according to Stephanie H. Kenen, administrative director of the Gen Ed program.
“It was partly because we had been saying that the Core is dead for eight years, and the undergraduates deserved to have something new,” she said, adding that the “excitement” of getting the large reform underway also played a role, although she would have liked some more time.
After six years, three presidents and FAS deans, and hundreds of pages of reports, the Gen Ed program launched in the fall of 2009. But the program’s obstacles had not ended with administrative turnover as that transition was matched by another event that roiled the University: the financial crisis.
LESS MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS
The biggest change to the undergraduate curriculum in three decades came just as the University’s endowment suffered its biggest loss ever, undercutting Gen Ed right from the start. As the endowment plummeted, Smith declared a FAS-wide hiring freeze in November 2008 and that spring announced an extensive list of cost-cutting measures to save $77 million in light of a projected deficit of $220 million.
Meanwhile, the first undergraduate class required to complete the Gen Ed program arrived on campus in September.
Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, the current chair of the Gen Ed Committee, said the impact of the financial crisis siphoned off financial resources and administrative attention that a whole reform of undergraduate education necessitates.
“The administration’s attention was understandably on dealing with the financial crisis,” he said, “whereas at the time of a launch what you really want is an administration that has plenty of time in its schedule to be going around to departments” to make sure they are committed to helping the program.
What emerged was a Gen Ed program lacking the resources to provide faculty members the proper spaces and help to set up courses, Hall said.
Furthermore, faculty members did not gain a proper understanding of the principles of Gen Ed in designing their courses, and departmental courses—designed as introductions to more specialized thinking—ended up diluting the message of the overall program, faculty members said.
Forced to create a collection of courses quickly without much funding to assist faculty in crafting courses and graduate students in their teaching strategies, the committee preparing the program accepted many syllabi that were very similar to Core classes, even as they did not fit the goal of the new program to create spaces for more generalized learning.
“In the context of reduced resources, there was a ready-to-wear Gen Ed if you shifted over some Core classes, which in practice is what happened,” said History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, who sits on the current Gen Ed review committee.
With administrative attention devoted elsewhere amid the financial crisis, the ambitious schedule to set up the cornerstone of a curricular reform of a past administration led to many of the same criticisms that Gen Ed was first designed to fix. The philosophy seemed unclear and the course selection arbitrary. And in the rush, the fundamental presence of the program, debated for years, was lost.
MICROCOSM, MACRO PROBLEMS
Although the administrative and financial circumstances of Gen Ed’s development hampered its capacity to succeed, faculty members emphasized that some shortcomings of the program are manifestations of larger issues in Harvard’s undergraduate education that FAS must address beyond Gen Ed.
“I think Gen Ed is a microcosm,” Kenen said. “I think it magnifies issues that are broader and longer-lasting.”
The teaching experience of graduate students, which has drawn extensive criticism over recent years, compounds and introduces issues within Gen Ed, with faculty attempting to alleviate problems in hiring TFs through the program.
Shaye J.D. Cohen, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, acknowledges that he tries to make his Gen Ed course, Culture and Belief 23: “From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism, From the Old Testament to Christianity,” as large as possible to ensure TF positions for his department’s graduate students. In departments like his with many graduate students but few undergraduates, it provides a way to reduce uncertainty for the TFs, he said.
As such, the issue of hiring graduate students in teaching capacities transcends Gen Ed but is acute there, Hall said, adding that in order to improve Gen Eds, administrators should think of strategies to address the uncertainty inherent in the TF experience, such as discussing pre-registration, section size caps, and other possible teaching responsibilities and teaching support for graduate students.
And while diversion of administrative attention was detrimental to the implementation of the program, getting undergraduates to understand and embrace the philosophy of Gen Ed has not been easy given Harvard’s sectionalized culture, according to program affiliates.
A successful Gen Ed program at Harvard should serve the role of broadening undergraduates’ education in that highly sectionalized culture, which is not necessarily the case at other schools, Menand said.
“We’re too specialized here, so you need something to pull them out of their specialization here,” Menand said. “The program has to work for your students and faculty and what you do well so that when students come here they think this is part of the Harvard experience.”
Indeed, undergraduates should be well aware from when they first consider applying to Harvard about the philosophy of Gen Ed and how it relates to their education when they arrive on campus, Jasanoff said.
Gen Ed’s lack of identity in the College emerged from this specialized academic culture, as faculty members and administrators have have failed to emphasize the benefits of understanding intellectual pursuits more generally in a liberal arts education, several program affiliates said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana acknowledges the College administration’s responsibility in articulating Gen Ed’s role to undergraduates.
“One of the things that we have to do better is communicate the understanding of general education and a liberal arts and sciences education,” he said.
THE FUTURE OF GEN ED
Amid the extensive criticism of the program, administrators and professors are intent on improving the Gen Ed program, though the path to success is anything but clear.
“[We will] be much more intentional in discussing liberal arts and sciences education earlier in our Harvard students’ careers,” Khurana said.
Administrators suggest that the attention to Gen Ed will grow as the faculty discusses its reforms. Program affiliates said they sense that courses will more closely reflect the principles of Gen Ed over time as faculty understand better how to implement the philosophy and new faculty members arrive and spend their whole teaching careers at Harvard under Gen Ed. Nevertheless, the debate about what will come out of a reformed program has barely begun.
The review report outlined some preliminary ideas and mentioned scrapping the program in favor of basic distribution requirements, although FAS affiliates say most of the Faculty is committed to reforming the program with the same philosophical principles of engaging with broader questions to understand the intellectual pursuit more broadly.
At the most recent Faculty meeting and since, faculty members and administrators have argued that making Gen Ed the centerpiece it was meant to be in Harvard undergraduate education will require administrative steps, Faculty legislation, and commitment to larger cultural changes.
Harvard, attracting international attention, has a responsibility to its undergraduates, faculty members say, and also to the many institutions that look to it to respond to longstanding issues that remain stubbornly prevalent in its undergraduate education.
And while not a specific line item within Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, Smith said the quality of undergraduate education, including the Gen Ed program, appears in many sectors of the FAS campaign.
Faculty members and administrators assure that assessing General Education at Harvard is not a one-time event and barely once in a generation. Reassessing, especially if similar issues persist, is vital to ensure that undergraduate learning is appropriate for a preeminent university, they argue.
“I don’t know why any of us would be doing this if we didn’t think we could provide an undergraduate experience that could be meaningful,” Kenen said.

When University President Drew G. Faust got word this April that students were blocking the entrances to Massachusetts Hall, she found another place to work without much of a thought.
The demonstrators, members of the activist group Divest Harvard, were demanding that the University divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels, a charge that Faust had already refused. But as the protesters attempted to escalate the debate, Faust did not respond for five days. When she did, she tendered an offer that the protesters had already refused during a previous demonstration: a meeting with the president, but on the condition that the protest end. Divest Harvard once again declined, but still ended its blockade the next evening. For Faust, business as usual returned—if it had ever even left.
The academic year 2014-2015 featured a number of public, campus-based challenges to Faust’s leadership. Students blocked her from her office, faculty responded negatively to a newly centralized sexual assault policy, and an even larger group of professors challenged the decision to modify their health benefits plans.
Each of these issues has presented Faust with an opportunity to make headlines, but Harvard’s president of eight years has instead chosen, more often than not, a calculated policy of public non-engagement. When campus news has surfaced, deputies like Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana have often made initial statements to constituents and the press, while Faust has skipped the bully pulpit and engaged behind the scenes.
It is an approach that Faust has adopted intentionally, and one that has allowed her to skate above certain campus issues in the public eye, delighting her supporters and frustrating many of those seeking a response.
“This is my eighth year, so you get a little bit accustomed to the constant surprises and emergence of issues,” Faust, who was installed in 2007, said this month.
The president of Harvard, with all the historical power and prestige of the office, has a voice that people want to hear.
“Every time Harvard sneezes there is a national attention, focus on that issue,” said former Princeton president Shirley M. Tilghman.
It is a reality that Faust seems to internalize.
“When I publicly engage on an issue, it elevates it,” Faust said in an interview this month. “So I want to be very careful of how I use my voice, and when I use my role in a very public way and when I try to work in quieter ways or when I let the people who are directly responsible for issues deal with those issues.”
In 2007, Faust put her philosophy more succinctly. Referencing Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter, Faust told the New York Times that she often considers the mantra “strategy is what you don’t do.”
Perhaps the most visible manifestation of this approach is Faust’s fraught relationship with the Divest Harvard protesters, who have staged four Massachusetts Hall protests in the last 13 months, each aimed at disrupting University business and generating a public presidential response. Those responses have been few and far between.
“I think it’s extremely disrespectful,” Divest Harvard co-coordinator Talia K. Rothstein ’17 said this month. “We want to talk about the people who are being affected, and she won’t go near them because she won’t go near us.”
Protesters have increasingly targeted Faust and her office this year, but unlike predecessor Neil L. Rudenstine, who went to work in Mass. Hall as two-dozen protesters occupied it demanding higher wages for Harvard staff members, Faust gave the demonstrators little face time. And while the living wage protesters of 2001 spent three weeks in Mass. Hall, during the 2015 sit-in, the Harvard University Police Department quickly shut down bathroom access, making an extended stay difficult. The sit-in lasted 24 hours. 
It was a strategy of limited engagement: While Faust did not give the protesters the public meeting they requested, Rothstein said no participants have faced discipline for breaking University rules.
Still, the lack of presidential attention has bothered some. Bill Jaeger, director of Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, questioned the tactic.
“As someone who has been on campus on a long time, it's interesting how dismissive or hard-edged the current administration has been,” Jaeger said. “I think there have been other moments at Harvard where there has been much more of a tendency to bring protesters cookies or hot chocolate.”
Student protests are nothing new for Harvard presidents. “1969 was a tough year. What was so tough about this year?” remarked one prominent alumnus, Paul J. Zofnass ’69, in a recent interview.
Still, Faust this year faced challeanges from higher and potentially more potent places. In the fall, dozens of Harvard Law School professors publicly blasted Harvard’s new University-wide sexual assault policy and procedures in an open letter in the Boston Globe. Targeting an initiative championed by Faust, the professors charged that the new procedures lacked adequate fairness and due process standards.
Publicly, Faust was quiet about the criticism. But behind the scenes, she went to work, engaging with the Law School and directing University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 to reach “an agreement that would work for everybody.”
In December, the Law School formally stepped out, launching a new set of procedures that broke with Faust’s University-wide approach. Some viewed the move as a challenge to Faust’s central administration; others saw the situation as an example of careful, effective leadership.
“Very few complicated issues are solved by someone putting their foot down and saying, ‘I'm not moving an inch,’” said William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. “To get to the resolution that the University had with the Law School...required a lot of one-on-one conversation, small group conversations.”
Faust also stayed quiet, at first, when members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously voted to ask her and the Harvard Corporation to reverse controversial changes to the health benefits plans for non-union employees. Amidst the controversy, Faust simply said she planned on “replying in due course.”
One week later, Faust announced a fund that would compensate faculty members who were affected the most, but said the plans would remain in place for the year.
“One of the things about my job is there's so many parts of it, and people have so much autonomy,” Faust said this month. “I don't control much around here in terms of what students are going to get upset about or what's going on in the world at large that is going to be reflected in the University or faculty issues…. There are always things happening, and that is one of the defining aspects of this job, and you can't get stressed by it.”
“A lot of this year was bringing things along that we had begun in one way or another, initiatives that I had introduced as early as the very beginning of my presidency, things like the Common Spaces with the Smith Center, things like the arts initiative with the museum opening,” Faust said in May.
But even in advocating for those initiatives, like a new undergraduate concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media, Faust has embraced a quieter leadership style than predecessor Lawrence H. Summers. It was during Summers’s fall from grace in 2005 and 2006 that Faust, then the dean of the fledgling Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, gained increased stature and recognition within the faculty as an authority on the status of women within Harvard.
In 2007, Faust moved into Mass. Hall as Summers’s replacement and Harvard’s first female president. With Summers’s missteps in her rear view mirror, Faust has stayed away from controversy and focused on seeing through a long-term plan.
The strategy of continuation is different from that of Summers, who favored identifying annual priorities, articulating them publicly, and advocating for them behind the scenes.
“She doesn't come and say, ‘I have one big idea each year,’” Lee said. “She has a series of ideas that are for Harvard in the long term. And they include integrating the University as ‘One Harvard’ where it should be.”
In “One Harvard,” Faust has embraced an initiative that Summers pushed into motion. The concept of centralization has manifested most prominently in Harvard’s first fully University-wide capital campaign. Faust has traveled around the world, from Beijing to Seattle, to meet with donors and host events to promote the fundraising drive that has raised at least $5 billion of its $6.5 billion goal.
Major gifts this academic year, such as Gerald L. Chan’s $350 million pledge to the School of Public Health in September—the largest single donation in Harvard’s history—have shown her to be an adept fundraiser. Chan’s gift made history in more ways than one: In exchange for the money, Faust—the president viewed by one observer as “a cautious pick"—and the Corporation agreed to rename the school in honor of Chan’s late father.
But some, including Summers, have urged Harvard to be bolder, not necessarily with naming rights but with a forward-thinking policy direction. In a 2011 Boston Globe op-ed marking the University’s 375th anniversary, Summers wrote that Harvard would have to “risk disruptive change” lest it “cede its preeminence to those with less distinguished histories but a clearer field, a cleaner canvas on which to paint boldly.” Asked about the 2011 op-ed this month, Summers indicated that he worries Harvard might be losing ground, particularly to Stanford, which has posted lower undergraduate acceptance rates than Harvard in the last two years while recruiting a stable of top faculty.
“In the last few years as I have visited Stanford and observed Harvard, the concerns I expressed in the Globe have increased. I hope the pace of change at Harvard will greatly accelerate in the years ahead,” Summers, now a University professor, wrote in an email.
Eight years is not a short time for the modern University president. Summers lasted five. Neil L. Rudenstine led Harvard, a school known for its proud, occasionally capricious faculty, for 10. But as Faust completes her eighth year, she is showing strong support in many of the right places, particularly with alumni, top donors, and members of Harvard’s governing boards.
“Unfortunately it's true that any president will begin to have difficulties with the faculty after certain years,” said former Overseer Peter L. Malkin ’55. “I think that hers have been less than most. So I think that she's done a good job of that.”
Other Harvard supporters have come across as nothing short of gushing.
“I think President Faust is one of the best leaders I've ever seen in a long career of writing biographies and doing journalism,” said author Walter S. Isaacson ’74, an Overseer who has catalogued the lives of Steve Jobs, Benjamin Franklin, and Albert Einstein. “She’s very calm and insightful when she addresses a problem because she knows how to listen and find a commonsense solution.” 
Overseers, Corporation members, and alumni alike credit Faust for her ability to listen and to engage often polar constituencies. Faust’s supporters say these qualities, together with her public patience, have kept small problems contained.
“One of her attributes is her capacity to be disagreeable, sometimes vehemently, but to not have it be personal,” said Overseer Kenji Yoshino ’91. “You realize this is someone who you can disagree with, who welcomes debate. Even if you are on the wrong side of the debate, you are never on the wrong side of her.”
With trust from Harvard’s governing boards and a fundraising apparatus that is plowing ahead, Faust looks forward to completing a campaign that has its sights set on a higher education record, seeing through the University’s Title IX framework, and launching a new undergraduate concentration in the fall.
It is clear that, for Harvard’s veteran president, the support is there and the wheels are turning. But Faust herself acknowledges that “every year has its challenges,” many of them unpredictable. And while Faust’s policy of public non-engagement has served her well, some would like her to take a larger public role.
“I would like her to [use] the bully pulpit of the Harvard presidency to speak out more on national issues, particularly on education and related to problems of K-12 and throughout the country,” Malkin said. “But I think she's trying to lead by example. And I think we need a little more public statement and a little more leadership in the public arena.”
For now, though, Faust is happy with her performance. Asked by The Crimson this month about how she might improve as a leader, she seemed surprised by the question.
“Is this my end-of-the-year performance review?” she asked, jokingly. “How would I answer that?”
