After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—In the minutes after the Harvard men’s basketball team defeated the favored Cincinnati Bearcats by a score of 61-57, the team came together near the baseline to salute the fans in section 103 of the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena. As the team waved and the band played, the crowd in Section 103 stood on its feet to give the Crimson a loud ovation.
It was a fitting salute. By early Wednesday afternoon, Harvard had sold all of the 350 tickets allocated to the University by the NCAA. While Cincinnati’s fans filled fewer than ten rows behind the team’s bench, Harvard’s supporters were fifteen rows deep.
After the game, players said that they felt the crowd’s energy on the court.
“Having the crowd come out and support us, that’s great,” said guard Wesley S. Saunders ’15. “It gives us a sixth man on the court...which was definitely needed against a team like Cincinatti,”
Brandyn T. Curry ’13-’14 said that the crowd endowed the team with an added sense of purpose.
“To have the crowd rooting for us, we feel like we have to do it for them,” he said after the game.  “We’re not playing for ourselves, we’re playing for Harvard University, and I’m just proud that we represented the University very well.”
For the Harvard affiliates gathered in Section 103, the game represented an opportunity to come together as a community and enjoy the festivity and exposure that have come with the program’s increasing success in recent years.
“[The basketball team] catalyzes everything,” said Mitchell L. Dong ’75, who sat in the front row of Harvard’s section and has followed the team during its three NCAA appearances. “This brings the whole community together. It’s one of the few times that Harvard is on national TV for a sport. We’re in the press for everything academically, but sports-wise, this really pulls the community together.”
Supporters in attendance included current students, faculty members, and alumni, many of whom had graduated long before the team made its first NCAA appearance in more than sixty years in 2012.
Oliver R. McNally ’12, who starred as a point guard for the basketball team and led the program to its NCAA Tournament appearance in 2012, said he was impressed by the number of fans who turned out to support the University.
“It’s unreal…. We have power conference teams all over [this arena]: Michigan State, Cincinnati, and we had the best contingent of fans," he said.
The day began hours before tip-off at the Red Lion Hotel in Spokane, where Harvard’s traveling party—the team, athletic department administrators, the Harvard University Band, and the Harvard University Cheerleaders—is staying for the tournament. Continuing a tradition established at the New Mexico regional of the NCAA Tournament in 2012, members of the band and cheerleading squad formed a human corridor to send the team off to the arena shortly after 9 a.m.
“We’re getting a lot better at this,” said Luke P. Cheung ’84, observing the orchestrated pomp. Cheung said that this year’s tournament was his third following the Crimson. John C. Wang ’88 said that he has started to account for postseason play in his schedule.
“We’ve started to budget this trip in our work schedules,” Wang said. “If they ever get an East Coast location, it’s going to be huge.”
Of the cities chosen to host NCAA Tournament games, Spokane was by far the furthest from Cambridge.
After the morning pep rally, fans trickled into the Spokane Arena and began to gather in Section 103. Some reflected on the program that Coach Tommy Amaker has built.
“We had one or two on the team who could touch the rim, and now athletically we can stand toe-to-toe with Cincinnati,” said David C. Scheper ’80, who once called the Harvard basketball games for WHRB, Harvard’s undergraduate radio station.
Sitting with Scheper was Amos “Alex” Lowder ’02, who played as a guard on the men’s basketball team while at Harvard.
“Coach Amaker has made a real effort to connect with alumni,” Lowder said, adding that the coach and his assistants make a point of stopping to talk with alumni when the travel to road games.
“It feels like a community,” Lowder said.
Scheper added that basketball, like football, has become a rallying point for alumni.
“When you’re really good at something that people can rally around, people will come from far and wide...even if the game is in Spokane.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
SPOKANE, Wash.— What comes after a fairy tale?
 
It turns out, for the Harvard men’s basketball team (27-4, 13-1 Ivy), Cinderella can lose a second glass slipper.
 
With less than five minutes left in Thursday’s NCAA Tournament contest against Cincinnati (27-7, 15-3 American Athletic Conference) and Harvard up by three, Crimson junior wing Wesley Saunders ran a give-and-go with sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers. Saunders took a couple dribbles through the lane, spun, and put up the shot.
 
Saunders’ trademark fadeaway was good, but so was the subsequent shot taken by Cincinnati co-captain Sean Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick received the ball feet away from the top of the key and drilled a long two-pointer, bringing the deficit back to one possession.
 
Two possessions later, a pair of Bearcat shots from the free throw stripe cut the Crimson lead to one for the first time since the opening half.
 
But then Chambers remembered what it was like to celebrate an NCAA Tournament win. And then he delivered.
 
Co-captain Brandyn Curry received a handoff from Saunders with about 10 seconds left on the shot clock and 2:05 remaining overall. Curry sent it to Chambers, who received the rock near the left wing, dribbled several times, and ended up at the free-throw line. Chambers rose up and buried the shot.
 
“[Harvard coach Tommy Amaker] says that’s my shot at the free-throw line,” Chambers said. “Coach says if you get there and it’s open, go ahead and take it. So, he believed in me, I’m pretty sure my teammates believed in me, and I believed in myself, and I was able to take it, and I was blessed to make it.”
 
From that point on, it was all Harvard, and two minutes later, the Crimson advanced to the third round of the Big Dance for the second consecutive year. Amidst “I Believe” chants from its fan section, Harvard pulled off the upset, this time defeating fifth-seeded Cincinnati, 61-57.
 
 “[H]aving [won a postseason game] last year, we know the amazing feelings you get from having an upset type of victory in this great tournament,” Amaker said. “I thought [those plays] were key moments offensively for us.”
 
It was several defensive plays, however, that closed out the matchup. With 1:33 to go, a loose Bearcat ball was snatched up by Kilpatrick, and the senior took several dribbles towards the basket before making contact with Crimson senior forward Kyle Casey. Casey flew backwards as the whistle blew, and the referee’s arm signaled that it was Harvard ball.
 
On the next Cincinnati possession, pressure defense from Saunders forced Kilpatrick to lose his dribble. Chambers picked up the loose ball and was fouled at the other end. His one converted free throw on the trip made it a two-possession game, effectively sealing the win for Harvard.
 
PRESS CREDENTIALS
 
The scouting report on Cincinnati emphasized one fact in particular: the Bearcats pressured its opponent, trapped its ball handlers, and forced them to make hasty decisions.
 
After Thursday’s game, Harvard could confirm those reports and almost saw its lead slip away—multiple times—as a result of the Bearcats’ press.
 
“We turned it over way too many times,” Amaker said. “They knocked it off of us…. We got frustrated at times when we couldn’t really pull away from them enough, when we had chances to do that.”
 
In the first half, a Crimson nine-point advantage was quickly transformed into a one-point lead as Cincinnati’s trapping press led to several bad passes and ill-advised decisions for Harvard.
 
With less than seven minutes left in the opening period, Curry attempted to pass out of a Bearcat trap, but his try was deflected, and a Cincinnati fast break ended with an emphatic alley-oop from forward Shaquille Thomas.
 
In a 28-second span from 4:42 to 4:14, Harvard committed three forced turnovers, equaling its total number of mistakes up until that point. And, thanks to a three-point dagger from Kilpatrick along with a Troy Caupain layup at the 3:57 mark, the Bearcats had made it back into the game. The score was 24-23, and Harvard looked rattled.
 
The defensive success was nothing unusual for a Cincinnati team that ranks 20th nationally in steals per game with 7.94. Accordingly, in the second half, when the Bearcats needed to pull another trick from up its sleeve, they turned once more to their press.
 
With just over three minutes remaining in the contest, two free throws from Caupain brought his Cincinnati squad within one, 54-53—the closest the spread had been since the first half. Nine seconds later, junior Steve Moundou-Missi was feeling the pressure that comes with facing one of the best defensive teams in the country. The forward caught the ball about 80 feet from his own hoop, and threw an errant pass that landed near Bearcat co-captain Justin Jackson.
 
Cincinnati had the ball with the chance to take the lead. Only 120 ticks remained in the game.
 
However, a Jackson missed layup and the clutch Chambers jumper wiped away many of the ill consequences of Harvard’s trouble with the press, enabling it to sneak by Jackson, who is 21st in the nation in blocks per game, and the entire feisty Bearcat squad.
 
“Their press was really good,” Casey said. “They put the pressure on. They hounded us for a lot of the game, and we had some difficulties handling it for a while, and then we figured it out. I wouldn’t say we’ve played against someone with that intensity for so long, but I think we were prepared for it.”
 
MONTE-VERTIGO
 
While Harvard hadn’t played Cincinnati in almost 40 years—the last time the two squads faced off was in the 1975-1976 season, when Harvard won, 77-76—certain players recognized familiar faces on the opposing bench.
 
Moundou-Missi and Jackson went to Montverde Academy together, and heading into Thursday’s matchup, both players remembered the days when they put on the same color uniform.
 
The fact that the two former-teammates would be matched up against one another was the first comment that Moundou-Missi made at the Crimson press conference on Selection Sunday. Four days later, the first question that Jackson received was about the Crimson junior, who Jackson called “cool,” “smart,” and “quiet.”
 
On Thursday afternoon, however, Moundou-Missi’s play was loud enough.
 
The junior was given the assignment of guarding Jackson, Cincinnati’s second-leading scorer. While Jackson connected at a 54.2 percent clip throughout the regular season, he was held to only five-of-15 shooting from the field in Thursday’s matchup.
 
Moundou-Missi, however, provided a dynamic performance on both ends of the floor. In the opening minutes of the game, the forward received a pass from sophomore wing Agunwa Okolie on the left baseline. He put the ball on the hardwood, and went up and under the basket, scooping the ball into the hoop.
 
His block with 8:05 left in the contest perhaps best encapsulated his defensive performance. After a Chambers missed pull-up jumper, Kilpatrick grabbed the outlet pass and took off the down the court. He looked to have an easy lane to the basket and laid the ball up, but Moundou-Missi came streaking down the paint, seemingly out of nowhere, and swatted the ball away, keeping Harvard’s eight-point advantage safe.
 
“Steve is our best post defender,” Amaker said. “He moves his feet very well and he’s very strong and can get up on the backboard to rebound it, but also [can] challenge and block shots…. [However,] we were a little lucky. Jackson missed a lot of things around the rim that I think ordinarily…he makes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the middle portion of its annual spring break trip to California, the Harvard softball team (9-8) split a pair of games with an opening win against Bethune-Cookman (9-18) and a loss to Loyola Marymount (14-10) on Wednesday.
.500 and .111. The Crimson’s batting average with runners in scoring position was the difference between its decisive 9-3 win over B-CU and its 6-3 loss against LMU.
“In the [B-CU] game we rallied hard and put some things together,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “And then in the [LMU] game we had some people up in key situations, and they just didn’t come through.… It’s a good sign that we’re getting so many runners on base, but we just need to be consistently tougher with runners in scoring position.”
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 6, HARVARD 3
With bases loaded and two outs in the fifth inning, the Crimson looked as if it might battle back from a 4-0 deficit to take its first lead of the game. But Loyola Marymount rookie Rachael Farrington got freshman Catherine Callaway looking to notch her fifth strikeout of the game and preserved the Lions lead, 4-3.
Loyola Marymount rallied for two insurance runs in the bottom of the fifth inning to extend its lead, which was all the run support Farrington would need en route to her first collegiate win, 6-3.
The Crimson fell behind early as junior ace Laura Ricciardone surrendered a grand slam to rookie right fielder Amanda Dirks in the bottom of the first inning. Harvard is not used to playing from behind with Ricciardone on the mound, as she has already recorded complete game shutouts against Texas Tech and Louisiana State University this season.
“[Ricciardone] needs to work through those tough situations, and I know she’s capable of doing it, [so] that’s why I left her in,” Allard said. “Facing that adversity and trying to get to a better spot is what preseason is all about.”
After the first inning, Ricciardone settled in and held the Lions to scoreless in the next three frames to hold the Crimson deficit to four.
Despite having runners on in every inning but the first, Harvard did not break through and score until the fifth inning.
The Crimson and Lions each finished with seven hits in the game, but Loyola Marymount outhit Harvard with runners in scoring position. The Lions scored five runs with two outs, while holding the Crimson to no two-out runs.
In the top of the fifth inning, a string of errors by Loyola Marymount let Harvard back into the game. After junior catcher Katherine Appelbe reached first on an error, back-to-back singles by captain Shelbi Olson and junior second baseman Katherine Lantz loaded the bases for the Crimson. Two consecutive errors by Lions’ infielders allowed Appelbe and Olson to score and cut Loyola Marymount’s lead in half.
The Lions committed three of its four total errors in the fifth inning.
A grounder off the bat of junior first baseman Adrienne Hume scored Lantz from third and brought Harvard within one. Although the Crimson reloaded the bases, the team stranded all three runners and squandered its best opportunity to take the lead.
HARVARD 9, BETHUNE-COOKMAN 4
The Crimson rallied for three runs in three different innings to lead B-CU by as many as nine runs in its first game on Wednesday afternoon.
Harvard jumped to an early 3-0 lead on a string of hits in the top of the first inning. Three consecutive singles by Lantz, junior shortstop Emily Gusse, and Lange put the Crimson on the board. Hume followed with a double to left to score Gusse and move Lange to third. Lange crossed the plate for Harvard’s third run of the inning on a fielder’s choice.
Lange went three-for-three with three RBI’s and two runs scored to pace the Crimson offense. With a hit in both games on Wednesday afternoon, Lange extended her early-season hitting streak to fourteen games.
“I’ve been focusing on putting good swings on good pitches,” Lange said. “My goal is to be a consistently tough out for the other team and I plan on keeping that mentality going into Ivy League play.”
Sophomore Morgan Groom retired the first 12 batters she faced, keeping the Wildcats hitless until the fifth inning. Groom finished the afternoon with a season-best nine strikeouts.
B-CU freshman Sabrina Anguiano surrendered three walks to set up another scoring opportunity for the Crimson in the third. A single by freshman catcher Lindsey Hagberg and an error by the Wildcats’ center fielder capped the three-run inning for Harvard.
Although the Crimson finished with only one more hit than B-CU in the game, Harvard was much more successful at manufacturing runs with an average of .500 with RISP compared to the Wildcats average of .273.
Walks continued to plague B-CU’s pitching, as freshman reliever Bailey Conner put three Crimson on before giving up a two-RBI double to Lange that extended Harvard’s lead to nine.
The Wildcats fought back in the bottom of the sixth with a series of hits. After two quick singles, senior second baseman Kelsey Rodney hit a double to center to knock in both runs. Still with no outs in the inning, freshman third baseman Kaitlin Alamprese launched a home run over the center field fence to tighten the score, 9-4.
Junior Gabrielle Ruiz came on to pitch in relief. After a passed ball and error by shortstop Gusse allowed two B-CU runners to reach base, Ruiz battled back with a strikeout and two forced groundouts to halt the Lions scoring in the sixth.
B-CU threatened again with first and third and just one out in the bottom of the seventh, but a strikeout and infield pop-up ended the team’s hopes and sealed a 9-4 victory for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Spokane wasn’t the only place that a Harvard basketball team was feeling victorious on Thursday. Hours after the men’s squad upset Cincinnati, the women (22-7, 11-3 Ivy) pulled out a nail-biting win in New Rochelle, N.Y. to advance to the second round of the WNIT for the third consecutive year.
 
With seven seconds left on the clock and Harvard up by two, Iona guard Aleesha Powell drove to the basket for a hard layup, drawing the foul on captain Christine Clark and making the basket for the three-point play. Powell, an 84.9 percent free-throw shooter, completed the and-one.
 
One-point Gaels lead, 6.7 seconds on the clock.
 
But Clark was not about to let her season—and Harvard career—end with that. The veteran took the inbounds pass from junior forward Erin McDonnell and took the ball from one end of the court to the other, blowing past five Iona defenders and putting up a layup of her own with 0.8 seconds left to give Harvard the lead.
 
Clark’s last-second heroics helped the Crimson end Iona’s WNIT run as Harvard outlasted the Gaels (26-6, 18-2 MAAC), 90-89, at the Hynes Athletic Center. 
 
“We had two options going in [to the final possession],” Clark said. “Our other option got taken away because they were running the zone-press on us, so I went with the next option, and that was me driving to the basket.”
 
The senior led the Crimson’s offensive attack all year, averaging 16.7 points per game, but was shut down for much of the night by Iona forward Joy Adams, who foiled Clark’s attempts all night to drive into the paint and held the guard to just five-for-18 shooting.
 
“They had Joy Adams, one of the most athletic players we’ve seen all year, on Clarkie,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I didn’t think Clarkie was going to get all the way…. But the Red Sea just opened up, and Clarkie did a great job, she was under control and read it, went all the way to the basket and didn’t force it.”
 
Harvard held a lead as large as 13 after starting the second half by shooting 83 percent from the floor. McDonnell came out of the break with a personal 5-0 run, senior guard Jasmine Evans threw in a trey, and a three-point halftime lead suddenly became 11.
 
Then, with ten minutes to go, Iona found a hot hand. A string of three treys in as many minutes cut the lead to three. A minute later, guard Damika Martinez missed a shot from downtown, grabbed her own rebound, drove into the lane, and kicked the ball out to Aaliyah Robinson beyond the arc. Robinson knotted the game at 72-apiece, wiping away the advantage that the Crimson had held since five minutes into the game.
 
“[Iona] was very, very athletic, and they shoot threes,” Delaney-Smith said. “I didn’t think they would shoot them as well as they shot them tonight, but it was a really fun, exciting game for people to watch. I don’t think it was that much fun to coach necessarily, but both teams shot the lights out.”
 
Harvard hit 50.6 percent of its field goals and 47.4 percent from deep—high numbers by any standard—and the Gaels outstripped the visitors in both marks, shooting 52.3 percent from the field and 50 percent from three-point range. Of Iona’s 65 attempts, 34 were threes. Iona’s 17 treys set a school record.
 
“They shot 17-for-34 from three with a hand to their face, so I wouldn’t even say our defense was bad,” Delaney-Smith said. “On many of those threes, we couldn’t have done much more. That’s just what they do, and they do it well. They literally put four three-point shooters out there and an incredibly athletic rebounder, and they drive and kick, and they drive and kick.”
 
When the Crimson’s offense sputtered in the second half, it turned to its defense, relying on the combined height of McDonnell and junior forward Temi Fagbenle to defend the drive and pull down rebounds, where Harvard edged Iona, 41-32.
 
However, the Crimson lost some of its height coming in with senior guard Missy Mullins out with an ankle injury. Mullins joined a number of injured or sick Crimson players, including starting point guard Ali Curtis, who logged just 15 minutes with a sore knee. Senior center Elise Gordon also played limited minutes. Sophomores Kit Metoyer and AnnMarie Healy played significant minutes off the bench with the depleted Harvard roster.
 
“To pull out a win where a team puts out their best shooting effort, I’m proud of that, especially missing two starters and four off the bench,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think everyone tried to tough it out a little bit, but we missed them all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In the wake of Harvard’s upset victory over the Cincinnati Bearcats in the NCAA Tournament round of 64 here on Thursday, the Back Page caught up with some key players for Michigan State, the four seed in the East region and the Crimson’s opponent in Saturday’s round of 32.
 
ADREIAN PAYNE, Senior Center
“I was watching a little bit on TV and I heard that they don’t run a lot or push the ball a lot, so it’s probably sort of a team like Wisconsin maybe, you know they’re really smart and they don’t turn the ball over a lot. They’re just solid, so we’re just going to have to come out and be solid too because they’re not going to be doing anything crazy.”
 
BRANDEN DAWSON, Junior forward
“We really didn’t watch a lot of their game. We were in here in the locker room and we watched a little of it towards the end. Those guys have great guards, they play solid, they don’t make mistakes.”
 
ALVIN ELLIS III, Freshman guard
“We’re not familiar with them, but we have managers and stuff to do research on them, and we’re going to watch some film tonight and tomorrow and learn their plays and see what it takes on Saturday.”
 
KEITH APPLING, Senior guard
“A lot of people had those guys picked to win that game [against Cincinnati]. Me, honestly, I thought that Cincinnati's athleticism would take over, but Harvard, they just seem like a grind it out team that can win many different ways.”
 
MATT COSTELLO, Sophomore forward
“We’ll learn a lot tonight. That’s the plan. I’m not quite sure what’s going with that but we’ll watch a lot of film tonight and see what we can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second leg of its 10-game California road trip, the Harvard women’s water polo team split four games Wednesday and Thursday, returning the team’s record to .500.
HARVARD 14, CAL LUTHERAN 4
In the second faceoff between the two teams this week, the Crimson (11-11, 1-0 Ivy) was able to pull out the victory yet again.
The game swung in Harvard’s favor from the beginning, as the Crimson took an early 4-0 lead in the opening quarter of play. The offense continued to click, adding five goals in the second quarter while limiting the Regals (4-18) to only two goals up to that point in the game.
Nine Harvard players contributed to the double-digit win, a season high for the team. Five Crimson players tallied more than one goal in the match up.
“We really picked up our game after the loss against Whittier,” senior co-captain Shayna Price said. “We think that we have the ability to play great water polo and come from the east and try and get some upsets [going forward]. We think that we have the ability to show what east coast water polo has to offer to the west coast.”
CAL STATE NORTHBRIDGE 11, HARVARD 9
Tied at eight goals going into the final quarter of play, the Crimson could not muster up enough offense to match the Matadors (16-5) as the game was decided in the final eight minutes.
Despite four goals by sophomore attacker Yoshi Andersen, Cal State Northridge was able to score three goals in the fourth quarter and come out on top. This was the first game Andersen played on the team’s California road trip after being out the previous weekend with an injury.
Junior goalie Ariel Dukes was in goal for Harvard, saving six shots during the contest.
“I think we definitely grew as a team,” Andersen said. “I think we had the potential to beat Northridge but I think we kind of stepped in our own way and I think it was difficult to see that we could have beaten them. Nonetheless, it is important game for us because we are going to see top-ranked teams this weekend.”
HARVARD 11, POMONA-PITZER 7
After a slow start, the Crimson was able to take charge of the game en route to its second win of the road trip.
The Sagehens (13-8, 1-0 SCIAC) came out to a 3-1 lead midway through the first quarter, but Harvard answered with three straights goals while holding Pomona-Pitzer to only one score to go into halftime with the lead.
The third quarter saw the Crimson offense surge forward, scoring six goals to take a 10-6 lead going into the final eight minutes of play. Sophomore Charlotte Hendrix led the scoring effort with three goals, while sophomore Rachel Lobato, Price, and freshman Michelle Martinelli each added two.
Harvard’s defense held strong in the final quarter of the game, not allowing the Sagehens back into the game. Junior Victoria Frager led the defense with five steals, while Dukes had two.
“We knew that we could play better [than we did against Whittier],” Price said. “It’s really fun being out here in the sun and playing outside and seeing all our families out here during spring break. I think we let that get to us and it got in the way of what we’re really out here for which is to play water polo.”
WHITTIER 12, HARVARD 9
In a back-and-forth battle that saw multiple lead changes throughout the competition, the Crimson could not come out on top.
The first quarter saw the teams come out knotted at three goals apiece. A breakaway goal early in the second quarter gave the Poets (13-10, 1-0 SCIAC) a one point advantage going into the second half of play.
Harvard saw scoring from across the roster. Senior co-captain Shayna Price registered her third hat trick of the season in the loss, while freshman Lexi Del Toro and Andersen added two goals each.
Coming back from the half, both teams matched each other’s goals in the third quarter. The deciding factor in the game came in the fourth quarter, as Whittier was able to get two goals into the Crimson’s net, while Harvard’s scoring was silent.
“We had trouble in our first game,” Price said. “We didn’t come out to play and it showed in the loss but after that game we really picked it up and came out to play the rest of those three games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.— The first comments from the Michigan State players at Friday’s media conference were respectful of the Harvard men’s basketball team, as if it were any other Big Ten or nonconference opponent.
“They’re a disciplined team,” sophomore guard Gary Harris said.
“They really don’t make a lot of mistakes, and they play together,” junior forward Branden Dawson said.
But when pressed whether they recognized any of the members of Harvard’s roster, the gap between the two programs became a little more evident. Outside of sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers, whose name Harris offered as playing in the same AAU circuit, the assembled Spartans could not name another one of the Crimson’s players.
Though they will undoubtedly learn them in the coming hours, the relative anonymity of Harvard’s roster reflects the size of the task in front of it. In its third-round NCAA Tournament matchup against Michigan State, the Crimson will be competing against one of college basketball’s best teams and a lineup full of superstars.
“They’re outstanding,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Let’s not kid ourselves. They’re incredibly balanced. I think that they’re playing their best right now. I think they’re in an incredible rhythm with their ball club.”
For the first half of the season, Michigan State looked like a probable No. 1 seed and a national championship contender, starting the season 18-1 and holding the No. 1 ranking in both the AP and Coaches Polls for three weeks. But a series of significant injuries to four of the team’s five starters derailed the Spartans’ momentum and sent them into a 5-7 spin that knocked them down to No. 22 in the country.
After regaining its now-healthy starters for the final two weeks of the year, Michigan State displayed some of its early season form in dispatching Northwestern, Wisconsin, and rival Michigan on three straight days to earn the Big Ten Tournament Championship. Following the release of the brackets last Sunday, the Spartans became a popular pick to win it all, including in the bracket of Obama.
The Spartans’ potent starting lineup boasts two likely first-round NBA selections in Harris and senior forward Adreian Payne. Harris will present a similar challenge to that of Cincinnati’s Sean Kilpatrick, a big two-guard with the ability to both shoot and get to the rim. As was the case against the Bearcats, the primary defensive responsibility for containing Harris will likely fall to junior wing Wesley Saunders, who has been effective in limiting the offense of the opposition’s best perimeter player all season.
The Crimson will have no obvious defensive strategy for guarding the 6’10”, 245-lb Payne, who scored a career-high 41 points in his team’s second-round victory over Delaware on Thursday, exhibiting each of the traits that make him such a formidable offensive threat. In one stretch of four possessions in the first half, Payne hit two three pointers, converted an and-one in the post with his off hand, and capped his personal 12-0 run with another three. And unlike against Cincinnati’s Justin Jackson, fouling Payne when he gets near the rim is not a productive strategy either—Payne went a perfect 17-of-17 from the line against Delaware.
“Their team is incredibly well balanced, and I think Payne is one of the bigger keys,” Amaker said. “[He can] score in the paint with his back to the basket, he can face up and knock down threes…and he’s also a big man that rebounds and blocks shots.”
If the Crimson manages to contain Harris and Payne, it still has to contend with McDonald’s All-American Keith Appling, the athletic Dawson, and playmaking guard Denzel Valentine, as well as the Spartans’ options off the bench.
Yet the Harvard players that took the stage prior to Michigan State did not look like the wide-eyed group that faced a second round of media obligations after their win over New Mexico a season ago. If they were intimidated by the challenge ahead of them, they gave no indication of it.
“I think that any team we match up against, we just try to play our game,” Saunders said. “We don’t really worry too much about what they do…. We just try to stick to our standards and principles, and do the things that have gotten us to this point.”
In last year’s third-round loss against another national power, Arizona, the Crimson looked overwhelmed, falling behind, 17-2, in the first seven minutes of the opening half. The team admitted that the glow of the previous round’s upset victory lasted longer than was healthy.
“Last year, we got emotionally drunk after that first win,” junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi said. “We kind of forgot the reason why we were there, and I think this year we are a lot more focused. I think we’re a lot more mature than we were last year.”
“We didn’t turn the page quickly enough,” co-captain Laurent Rivard added. “We made sure to do it differently this year.”
And though the Spartans have designs on making a deep run in this year’s tournament, Harvard has no intention of simply making way for them—it has milestones of its own to achieve.
“Absolutely our goal is to make more history,” co-captain Brandyn Curry said. “Our goal is every year to get better…from going to the CIT to the NIT to the NCAA to winning a game. We’re getting better and better slowly, so, obviously, the next step is we have to win two games in the NCAA Tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—On Saturday night (8:40 EST, TNT), the Harvard men’s basketball team will take on the Michigan State Spartans in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. In part II of his two-part preview, staff writer David Freed looks at the individual matchups of the competing squads.
Point Guard: Siyani Chambers v. Keith Appling
The matchup here is youth versus experience. The Crimson sophomore, described by Izzo as “one tough cookie” on Wednesday, carried himself well against the tough Bearcat press, as Harvard had just four turnovers in the second half with Chambers playing nearly every minute. Chambers is fearless, even to the point of disregard. Sometimes that results in barreling at full speed towards a waiting Justin Jackson, only to see his layup swallowed whole by the Bearcat center. Other times it results in being able to shut out his 1-of-9 shooting performance in the contest’s first 38 minutes to nail a game-clinching jumper from the free-throw line.
Such is confidence, which Appling also has in spades. The senior guard, who averages 12 points and 4.7 assists per game for Izzo’s squad, will be motivated to avoid being the first player to graduate under Izzo without going to the Final Four. Like Bearcat point guard Ge’Lawn Guyn, Appling is long and rangy, and will use his length to contain the smaller Chambers all night.
Shooting Guard: Wesley Saunders v. Gary Harris
Despite his position as the Crimson’s leading scorer, Saunders has had a relatively quiet second half to his season. After scoring in double figures in each of the team’s first 29 games last year, Saunders had 12 or less in six consecutive games late in the 2013-2014 Ivy League season. No longer the offense’s focal point and last resort, he takes fewer shots per game, but has been less effective this year—registering just a 46 percent field goal percentage.
Harris has likewise seen a drop in efficiency, only it has corresponded with a strong increase in usage. He was a prohibitive first-round pick after his freshman season but returned to lead a loaded Spartan squad. He averaged 17 points per game, but shot just 35 percent from three after shooting 41 percent the year before. However, he remains a rangy defender whom Izzo can rely on to shut down opposing perimeter weapons.
Harvard will need the assertive Saunders early and often in Saturday’s matchup. The junior knocked down key shots against the Bearcats, but did the majority of his work on the defensive end guarding Cincinnati co-captain Sean Kilpatrick. He must succeed on both sides if he and his team are to emerge victorious.
Small Forward: Laurent Rivard v. Denzel Valentine
Although Rivard is primarily known for his shooting, against Valentine it will be crucial that he be able to rebound the ball as well. The co-captain pulled down five rebounds against the physical Bearcats, including a couple key late-game boards in traffic to seal the win for the Crimson. Valentine (6’5”, 225 pounds) is nearly identical in size to Rivard (6’5”, 215) but could not play more differently.
Although Valentine shoots 36.5 percent from deep, he operates mostly as a slasher who does a little bit of everything for Izzo’s team. The Spartan forward dishes out nearly four assists a game, second-best on the team, and pulls down almost six rebounds from the small forward position. Rivard shoots the ball almost exclusively from three and is not relied on to be a playmaker, only a steady ball handler, in the Crimson offense. His ability to prevent Valentine from getting to the rim and his success crashing the boards will be almost as crucial as his three-point stroke in this one, however.
Power Forward: Steve Moundou-Missi v. Branden Dawson
Both Moundou-Missi and Dawson are tough, underrated post players that lead their teams in rebounding while shooting better than 50 percent from the floor. Moundou-Missi is the most reliable post presence Harvard has and dunks everything in sight. He will try to contain the versatile Dawson on the other side, while making sure to box out the aggressive Spartan on the glass.
As a group, the Spartans pound both the offensive and defensive boards, and it will be crucial for Moundou-Missi—often the only player Amaker leaves behind to hit the offensive glass—to post double-digit rebounds on Saturday. Delaware shot well against Michigan State but was dominated, 42-24, on the glass—a fate Harvard will look to avoid.
Center: Kyle Casey v. Adreian Payne 
Payne, who led off the Big Dance with 41 points and an NCAA-record performance from the free-throw line on Thursday, is the heart and soul of the Spartan attack. His versatility—the 6’10” forward shoots 44 percent from three—gives Michigan State a number of different offensive options. It not only clears space for Dawson to operate inside, but it also spaces the floor for Appling and Harris to drive (and sometimes kick to a waiting Payne).
Although Amaker may choose to match up the bulkier Moundou-Missi against Payne, Casey is the cornerstone of the team’s defense. A rangy, athletic defender, Casey struggles with foul trouble but is a dominant shot-blocker who moves his feet well. On the offensive end, he has the range to step out and shoot from the perimeter, but is also a vicious slasher and transition trailer—as evidenced by his single-handed destruction of the rim against Cincinnati.
Casey’s ability to stay in the game and limit Payne’s contributions on the offensive end will be key to the Crimson’s upset chances. To win, Harvard will need Casey to be at his best, which means a solid last line of defense with an aggressive offensive mindset.  
Bench:
Michigan State has a deep bench, anchored by three-point threats Travis Trice and Kenny Kaminski. Trice had 19 points against Delaware in the Tournament’s second round, flying off screens and showing an improved handle. Because of the amount of injuries the squad faced all year, Izzo trusts his bench. On the other side, Amaker has once again gone to an eight-man rotation, cutting out rookie Zena Edosomwan, and sticking with his starters, co-captain Brandyn Curry, junior Jonah Travis, and sophomore Evan Cummins. Travis and Cummins give much-needed frontcourt depth, while Curry provides another ball handler and ace three-point shooter to spot Chambers in key moments.

Break is only three days longer. If you haven’t figured out how to eat without the luxury of walking downstairs yet, we’re here to help.
 If you’re at home:1. Take advantage of your parentsEspecially if your parents are good cooks and you miss home-cooked meals! Plead to the ‘rents and tell them that you’ve been sick of HUDS since the first week of school.
2. Fast food all the wayIf your parents aren’t the best chefs, or if you’ve given up on begging, there’s always fast food. McDonald’s for days
3. DeliveryMaybe you don’t have a car or access to a nearby fast-food joint. Have no fear: there’s always delivery. Order in, watch a movie, and eat away.
4. The last resortIf all else fails: your parents have given up on you, you’ve had too much McDonald’s, or the pizza delivery boy is questioning your sanity—you might have to cook for yourself…
 As bad as it may seem—getting off your couch and missing a few minutes of the next Netflix episode—we have a few suggestions for quick last resort meals to make.
Grilled Cheese: Basically a delicacy. But at the same time, it’s an easy delicacy. Just butter up some bread, toss a little cheese in between, and you’re the next Martha Stewart without the jail time.
PB&J: It seems premature, but what’s tastier than a walk down memory lane? Pro tip: Cut triangles, not squares – tastes so much better.
Ramen: So easy a Yalie could do it. Just boil some water and you have yourself some of the best ramen noodles a Harvard student could ask for.
Easy Mac: Hopefully you’ve already stacked up on enough Easy Macs from the vending machine that you remembered to take some home.
Spaghetti: If you’re feeling really ambitious. Just remember to add water.
If you’re on vacation:
Room service: Always the way to go. It’s just like having a dining hall next door, but you don’t have to move an inch.
But if your parents have found out how much room service you’ve been ordering from the hotel, or if you’ve spent all of your money on booze (we’re hoping the latter is your issue), see #4. Hopefully your hotel has a microwave and some bread.
 If you’re stuck on campus:
 So you’re HUDS-less...what’s there to do?
Put your house/dorm kitchen to useHead over to Broadway Market, Shaw’s in Porter Square, Whole Foods in Central Square, or Market in the Square and grab some groceries. Then follow #4, unless you’re feeling gourmet ambitious.
Beg the parentsTell them you are desperate for a care package filled with candy and snacks. If that’ll take too long, just ask them for some extra crimson cash to stack up on Easy Mac and Ramen from the vending machine.
Try to find some cheap food in the SquareWe all know how easy it is to spend all of our money on Pinocchio’s pizza or Tasty Burger. Maybe a few subs from Al’s will be good on your wallet.
Restaurant week!Leave the Harvard bubble and get some deals at some of Boston’s finest restaurants.
 
 
A revolution quietly took place during these first few months of 2014, changing the face of standardized testing. The next day, the evidence of the brawl was spread across the Internet, lining the pages of newspapers- the SAT had been completely overhauled.
According to a NYTimes article, as of 2013, the ACT had won the testing race, with 1,666,017 students taking it, versus 1,664,479 for the SAT. It has become the clear favorite of harried and stressed high schoolers looking for their golden ticket to college across the country.
That isn’t to say that the SAT has stopped growing; rather, both tests have seen spikes in the number of participants, with the ACT simply pulling in more. It seems that students are trying to make sure that they have done all they can to get into their university of choice. Perhaps an extra grade, a solid score on the ACT can push them over the hump and through the admissions door. This played a role in prompting the newly announced changes to the SAT format.
According to FairTest, an organization critical of standardized testing for college applicants, 730,000 students took the ACT  and 1,000,748 took the SAT in 1986. Then in 1996, the ACT was taken by 924,663 and the SAT by 1,084,725. This trend continued into the new millenium, with gap narrowing to 1,206,455 and 1,465,744 for the ACT and SAT in 2006, respectively.
The main issue with the SAT in previous years was its length and focus on vocabulary- however, the ACT was more time-constricting, with 45 minutes to answer 75 English questions, versus 35 minutes for 40 reading questions on the SAT. Now, there will be no more guessing penalty, an optional essay, no archaic vocabulary, and more practical math, such as linear equations, rounding out the total high score to 1600.
In addition, a new partnership with Khan Academy will allow test-takers access to free SAT study material. Furthermore, those who qualify will be able to apply to four colleges free of charge and sans pesky fee waivers.
Hopefully, the SAT’s ploy to increase the amount of test-takers will pay off, while helping ease the fretting of high schoolers in the face of their college admissions. We’re looking for a win-win here; regardless, the money sent on the exams still goes to the same non-profit organization of the College Board.
