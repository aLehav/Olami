After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Earth Day now past—reminding us all to appreciate nature and more immediately how we’re brutally murdering it—the importance of connecting with our environment is once again at the forefront of our minds. And so as finals loom and you try to swerve and run at your summer plans with open arms, remember to take a few moments here and there to breathe the fresh air. Reminisce about simpler times, when playing outside was a priority and you’d never heard of an essay longer than your book reports.

Arnold Arboretum: Arborway, Boston
Visit Jamaica Plains and get in touch with your inner Steve Irwin as you tour one of the only green areas left in our great city. The second-largest link in the Emerald Necklace, the Arboretum is certainly a hidden gem, housing over 280 acres of land and almost 15,000 individual plants. Tours are given every day during the spring, and this year’s Lilac Sunday is at the very beginning of finals. So if you’re one of the lucky ones with late finals, stop gloating and bring back some lilacs to your stressed-out friends.

Harvard Museum of Natural History: 26 Oxford St
Of course, if you’re too “busy” with “schoolwork” to put in the effort of a day trip, there is always the much more convenient Museum of Natural History, just down Oxford Street, past Annenberg. Vicariously live through a curation of findings from scientists who are actually out in nature, observing and experiencing. It’s even free if you bring your ID. A new exhibit up since April 28, “‘Pop-up’ Exhibit: The Global Exposure Project,” features HBS students finding “their passion for seeing the world.” If they can do it, you should gain a little hope for yourself.

Tercentenary “Theatre”: You Know Where This Is
But if you’re completely hopeless, at least take a few seconds here and there to gasp in some fresh spring air as you sprint from library to class to office hours and back. Momentarily immerse yourself in sweet, languorous memories of Yardfest and get in tune with humanity at its purest: tourists. Watch as they find wonder in items such as a church, a library, and a statue. They’ll get their thrill from that cardboard cutout of JFK in some Weld freshman’s window, and you’ll get yours from watching them feed worryingly overweight squirrels.

Who is this “we”?
It’s a common question, leveled at anyone who slips slyly out of the singular and into the first-person plural. Sometimes, the speaker seizes at “we” to shirk responsibility—the same way a switch from the active to the passive can shift the blame with it, à la Richard Nixon’s “mistakes were made.” Other times, “we” confers more responsibility than it deflects.
No matter the variation, “we” lets the writer move outside of herself. It allows caretakers to control children, or doctors to patronize patients, when “we” really means “you”: “We’re a little fussy this evening. Perhaps it’s time for us to go to bed?” and “How are we feeling today?”
The royal “we,” of course, means “I.” It turns king into kingdom: “We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat,” Queen Victoria, speaking for the state, said of the Second Boer War. It also allows a ruler to express a personal opinion in a way that seems proud rather than petty. The famous, and arguably apocryphal, “We are not amused” comes to mind. (The royal “we,” it turns out, isn’t only for royals but also those who consider themselves close enough to the crown to claim. Upon the birth of her first grandchild, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced to the press, “We have become a grandmother.”)
The editorial “we” isn’t much different.
Most times, the newspaper editorialist speaks for the paper. Other times, she seems to speak for the country. Either way, she wields “we” like a sword, slicing at politicians, pundits, and presidents foreign and domestic with all the power the name of a major (or not so major) media outlet can bring to bear.
As far as the public is concerned, the New York Times endorsed Hillary Clinton this winter—not Francis X. Clines, or Elizabeth Williamson, or whichever individual writer put pen to paper in support of the candidate. And as far as our campus is concerned, the Harvard Crimson came out against the change in the House Master title this fall, and condemned calls for the university to divest from fossil fuels, and demanded Evelyn Hammonds’s resignation after 2013’s email search scandal—not me.
I’ve played the part of editorialist since freshman fall. Inhabiting the “we” takes some getting used to, but after a while, it starts to feel natural. I’m not writing for myself or as myself; I’m writing as something bigger.
There’s power there. Invoking the “we” has proved the best way to pitch The Crimson’s editorial board to small-fish freshmen looking to make something of themselves: “We’re the voice of the paper,” a younger member of the board says to the potential recruit. A quick pause. “We’re the voice of the student body,” he adds. Pause again. “We’re the voice of Harvard.” That tends to raise eyebrows. It also tends to work.
But for all the power the editorial “we” can hold, there’s also something stifling about it. I’ve spent so many semesters and so many words pretending to be an “us,” that I’m starting to wonder what it means to be a “me.” With the voice of the paper, the voice of the student body, and the voice of Harvard echoing in my head and spilling from my fingers, I haven’t paid much attention to my voice at all. The same has been true of my editing: I’ve policed other peoples’ writing rather than working on my own—I’ve not found my voice, but instead sought to understand those of others, from their tone and technique to style and substance.
So here I am, on the cusp of adulthood, and still searching for what I thought every kid was supposed to find in college. Worse yet, I want to be a writer. And if I don’t know my voice, I can’t know what kind of writer I want to be—what I want to write about, or where and how I want to write about it.
That is the problem. This column has been, in part, the solution: a step, every other week, toward figuring myself out. Sometimes, even here, I find myself saying “we” when I mean “I.” It’s a hard habit to kick, but the jolt of reality I’m going to get on May 26 could end up being just what I need. I’ll be starting a life that’s really, for the first time, my own. Perhaps I’ll happen upon a voice that’s my own along the way.
I guess this is goodbye, then. I’m off to find a me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have mixed feelings about the end of spring semester. As yet another academic year comes to an anticlimactic end, my sense of mortality is reaffirmed. No one has time for one another, and conversations become limited to two topics: final exams and summer plans. The former bores people at best (who on earth actually enjoys discussing finals?); the latter only serves to stress those who have yet to set their summer plans in stone.
Spring also brings about the sun’s return, creating the perfect atmosphere for perfect pictures, but also attracting yet another wave of tourists. Oddly enough, the beautiful weather almost serves to mock me. Here I sit, trapped inside Widener library as children play tag and enjoy ice cream in the Yard. No matter; one day they’ll discover responsibility and join me in my gloom.
However, no date in particular sums up my conflicted relationship with spring better than the 25th of May. On that day, three Harvard cadets will commission and enter the U.S. Army as Second Lieutenants. On the one hand, the thought of my friends commissioning contributes to a general sense of isolation; their graduation will reduce Harvard’s Army ROTC program to a mere three contracted cadets.
On the other hand, I couldn’t be prouder. Falletta, Clarke, and Perkins will make excellent Army officers. Their combination of discipline with understanding helped foster a training environment that focused on mentoring, rather than lecturing. More importantly, their sense of humor helped ease my former freshman self, reassuring me that I wasn’t the only odd one, to say the least.
My feelings extend to all the cadets in our battalion commissioning this May. They’re more than my fellow cadets; they’re some of my closest friends. Although the graduating class contributed to my marginalization as a communist (jokingly, of course), I’ve come to love their snarky sense of humor.
As our cadets prepare to commission in less than a month, I can’t help but feel a bit uneasy. Recent political headlines haven’t been the most comforting. The statements of some presidential candidates may seem funny to most at Harvard, but they’re disquieting to me. My friends may find themselves in the hands of a commander in chief, who, quite frankly, might very well instigate the next series of unnecessary wars.
In the dining hall, I sometimes overhear what other seniors will be doing post-Harvard. Some will earn mountains of cash. Others will advance knowledge as they spend their days working for think tanks or studying as part of a prestigious fellowship. Many will carry on their days as students in graduate school. A few will take time off to explore the world.
This year’s ROTC graduates could have enjoyed any of the aforementioned futures. They are among our nation’s best and brightest. Physically fit, mentally tenacious, and experienced leaders, the cadets graduating this May would have wanted for nothing had they chosen a different route. And yet here they are, confidently commissioning into the armed forces whilst our country’s political situation remains uncertain.
I won’t be present for Harvard’s commissioning ceremony on May 25th, or Wellesley’s, or Tufts's, or Salem State’s, or Endicott’s, or Gordon’s, or MIT’s. I won’t see any of my comrades get their butter bars this May. I won’t be there for the cheesy photos, the annoyingly small refreshments and snacks that accompany every formal event, or the unnecessarily long speeches. I won’t experience the tears, laughter, snarky remarks, or the streams of sweat as we sit for uncomfortably long periods of time in uniforms unsuited for humidity.
Instead, I’ll be stuck in some air-conditioned office, filing papers and taking phone calls to fulfill the stereotypical image of a college student intern spending his summer in D.C. To the cadets commissioning this May, I wish I could be there to salute you. I don’t know how the hell we’re going to run this battalion without you.
Very respectfully,
Your Resident Commie Cadet

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weekends ago, students reported thefts of a whopping 13 laptops and two iPads along with an assortment of other personal items from their dorm rooms. Following the uncanny and sudden uptick in these types of incidents, the Student Life Committee of the UC voted unanimously to support an initiative to install security cameras in dorm entrances. The Committee's support of this initiative is contingent on the fact that the cameras be used exclusively for retroactively identifying and pursuing perpetrators and not for disciplining students.
Given the rates of crime and theft on this campus, likely a function of its urban setting, installing cameras in entrances to dorms and upperclassmen houses is a worthwhile endeavor. The Harvard University Police Department reports that about 90 laptops are stolen on campus each year. That close to 15 percent of this yearly total has been reported over the span of one weekend suggests that the situation is not improving and may in fact be worsening. Like the Student Life Committee, we only support this initiative if the cameras are not used to surveil students in the entrances of their dorms, but if HUPD believes that more cameras could aid in recovering stolen items, this is a good triage measure.
That said, we also recommend more responsible and active efforts on the part of students to pursue other strategies that prevent crimes from occurring in the first place. In eight of the recent incidents, victims of thefts had left their doors unlocked or ajar, an irresponsible move that renders students susceptible to theft but could be remedied easily at no cost.
Unfortunately, it seems that the UC is falling into a pattern of trying to overstep the administration’s power to solve all student problems. Recently, the UC caused a stir when it asked the administration to allow students more time to create their Harvard Key accounts, a process that takes mere minutes to complete and has been available to students since November. In that scenario as in this one, we find that the UC is pandering to students at times when it should be instructing them.
Indeed, students have agency in these situations, and neither they nor the UC should feel entitled to too much help from the administration. HUPD provides extensive literature that instructs students on how to protect themselves from crimes like these, and the advice echoes what should seem, on many counts, like common sense. Installing security cameras at dorm entrances certainly makes sense, but in this case, we would prefer to see the UC use its clout to instruct students to help themselves, rather than only focusing on administrative solutions.

To the Editor:
As an alumna of the College and a member the Bee, I find the recent final club fracas narrow minded and missing the voice of a woman who benefited from a single sex social outlet. The camaraderie and confidence that women's clubs foster can mitigate the social imbalance of the dominant male clubs, and do more for young women than hewing to the calls for co-ed clubs, or abolishing them altogether. The latter would not solve sexual misconduct, but it would thwart the vital option of all-female fellowship on campus.

Alice Engel '04 lives in New York City. This letter represents her opinion, not that of the Bee Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I will never forget the final lecture of United States in the World 35 (“Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education”) at the end of last semester. That day, guest lecturer and Colorado State Senator Mike Johnston left us with a piece of advice that I wish more people could have heard.
Senator Johnston said that when we go home and someone asks us, “What are you going to be?” tell them that they are asking the wrong question. Instead, tell them that they should be asking, “What problem are you going to solve?”
With the prospect of entering the working world as a Harvard alum just around the corner, I’ve recently found myself reflecting deeply upon the senator’s words and what the purpose of my Harvard education is.
Senator Johnston helped me realize that my purpose at Harvard is something greater than myself. The world-class degree I will soon bear in my hands is valuable not just because of the opportunities it may open for me but also because of its potential to put me in a position to help others.
I am confident that I am not alone in saying that I could not have made it to Harvard by myself. Many of us can think of at least one person in our lives who helped build and hold the ladder that we then climbed. Whether it is the family member who showed you unconditional love from the day you were born, the teacher who inspired your love for learning, or the mentor that believed in you, incredible achievements such as getting to Harvard are rarely if ever the result of unilateral efforts.
Each of us carries an important responsibility to pay forward whatever help we received from those who supported us in our journeys that led us here.
I appreciate that Dean Rakesh Khurana begins each of his remarks by quoting the mission of Harvard College—“to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society”—for it is an appropriate reminder of the broader purpose of our education. Fundamental to the word ‘citizen’ is the idea that each one of us will leave this campus with certain responsibilities as members of a larger civic community. The mission concludes by stating that our purpose at this college is to begin to gain a sense of what we want to do with our gifts and talents, to assess our values and interests, and to learn how we can best serve the world.
This hope that each of us learns how we can best serve the world should be understood in the broadest sense. While many of us will graduate from Harvard to pursue careers that involve direct public service, the responsibility to help others lies with all of us, not just those select few. No matter what path we choose, from business to law, from health to technology, from academia to journalism, or one of the many other impressive fields that Harvard graduates enter each year, we should each carry deeply in us the attitude that we must use our talents and gifts to help solve problems and better the lives of others.
This means being the type of engineer that identifies first with the problem you want to solve rather than the money to be made. This means being the type of doctor that is motivated by patients, not profits. This means being the type of business executive that cares less about the job title and more about how to use that position to make the world a better place.
In short, I believe that we all have the capacity and responsibility to serve. Martin Luther King, Jr. said it best, speaking from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta 48 years ago: “Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve… You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love. And you can be that servant.”
With this mindset—one that has us thinking more about the problems we want to solve and less about the positions we hope to attain or the money we hope to make, that has us looking to serve no matter what we end up doing in life—I am confident that each and every one of us will not only go on to live out our dreams as professionals, academics, entrepreneurs, and artists but that we will also go on to make the most of our amazing talents and opportunities to make this world a better place for mankind.

Students organizing on-campus formals are remembering to arrange for security in addition to other costs associated with the event, prompting concerns over expenses for some House Committees.
According to the Harvard University Police Department website, a patrol officer costs $57.30 per hour and party details cost $70.30 per hour. Rebecca J. Ramos ’17, a Cabot House Committee co-chair who helped plan Quad Formal, said paying for HUPD was a frustrating addition to the event budget.
“There would already be HUPD officers around the quad for example at that time, so it’s frustrating that a large percentage of our budget has to go to event logistics like that,” Ramos said.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said some events, such as formals, necessitate an increased police presence.
“HUPD officers are on duty 24/7, but certain events and activities on campus require an extra level of police coverage to provide adequate public safety,” he said.
Despite the cost and organizing required, logistics regarding security often are not formalized until later in the event planning process.
“We began planning [the formal] probably right after winter break,” Freshman Formal co-chair Jamie A. Hawkins ’19 said. “We began planning security probably only a couple of weeks ago.”
The student-run Crimson Emergency Medical Services staffs events for free. Safety and security measures vary depending on the event, but most are coordinated through the Office of Student Life.
The OSL requires student organizations to register events that meet any of the following criteria: an attendance of over 100 people, an admission fee, the serving of alcohol, a weekend night date, fundraising, the selling of goods, a setting in an outdoor venue, or the inclusion of a raffle. Exceptions are made for certain venues on campus where location-specific staff manage the logistics, for example Sanders Theatre.
Since HUPD and CrimsonEMS only cover spaces on campus, the process for off-campus events is different, with students coordinating more with venue staff.
“The venue will drive what the security levels look like because it’s ultimately the responsibility of that venue to make sure that the event goes well,” Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich said.
For events that do take place on campus, Friedrich said completing the registration form three weeks prior to the event leaves an optimal amount of time to connect organizers to necessary resources, including CrimsonEMS and HUPD.
Friedrich added that safety and student well-being is the “utmost priority,” and that while the College has standard safety and security plans for regular on-campus events, coverage is often determined through constant communication with student organizers.
CrimsonEMS also looks at data from previous events before deciding on staffing levels for upcoming ones.
“We are a pretty data-driven organization so we have past event data that we look at whenever we staff an event,” CrimsonEMS Chief and an inactive Crimson editor Bryan L. Bu ’17 said. “For most events, we do communicate with the event staff and gauge their attendance and also the nature of the event.”

This weekend, students, faculty, and Cambridge residents came together for the 24th annual Arts First festival, a showcase of a variety of art forms including dance, music, theatre, and public art.
Produced by the Office for the Arts, the four day event brought visitors and students alike to art-filled spaces spread across campus. From acapella in the yard, to dancing in the Science Center plaza, artists found use for many public spaces.
Paige E. Peltzer, a student at the Graduate School of Design who attended a Friday afternoon jazz concert, said she “stumbled upon it after just walking by.”
Jack Megan, Director of the Office for the Arts and Producer of Arts First, said more faculty and University affiliates were involved in the festival than in prior years.
Megan said Arts First can be used as a platform for students to shed light on current discussions on campus, such as sexual assault.
“I’m very aware that students care about these things,” said Megan. “I want to help them give voice to that.”
The lineup of events also featured theater productions. Boyd I. R. Hampton ’16, the playwright and director of “Poise and Rationality,” said he hoped to highlight often underrepresented groups through his piece.
“Wedding farces tend to ignore strong females, gay characters, and millennial views, in short. And so I wanted to direct a farce that had all of that, and I couldn’t find one, and so I wrote one as part of the intro to playwriting class,” he said.
Madison E. Deming ’18 , one of the producers of “Poise and Rationality,” said Arts First allowed audience members to discover art created at Harvard. Deming said the events also helped highlight the new Theatre Dance and Media concentration.
“I just love that this weekend gets to put a spotlight on all the amazing work that happens after classes are over, and also this new concentration that’s going to help bring art into the classroom,” Deming said.
On Saturday, Harvard’s various acapella groups performed in front of the John Harvard statue. Desmond L. Green ’17, a member the Lowkeys group, said he enjoyed the “Jammin’ A Cappella” event.
“We  all come out to support each other, and it’s one of the very very few times that happens,” Green said.
“I like the breadth and the width of the Arts Firsts show,” Thomas V. Earle ’16, another member of the Lowkeys, said. “It gives every artistic community that I know of a place to publicly express.”

UPDATED: May 2, 2016, at 12:17 p.m.
Dozens of entrepreneurial teams from six schools descended upon Yenching auditorium Saturday for the Intercollegiate Pitch Off as a part of an undergraduate-run accelerator demo.
Each team had to pitch their startup idea to an audience of around 100 aspiring entrepreneurs and investors. Entrepreneur teams from Harvard, Northeastern, MIT, Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania presented their business ideas, ranging from property management apps to healthcare insurance selection tools.
This is the second iteration of the event; organizers hosted last year's venue in New York. Harvard organizer Benjamin I. Pleat ’17 said based on last year’s success, the Pitch Off will now become an annual event. Alexandra Sukin '19 was another Harvard organizer.
Aleeza H. Hashmi ’16, who is a member of the Harvard Ventures club, said the event was also an opportunity to meet aspiring investors from other schools.
“IPO might be the only thing that brings all these schools together in a way that’s not competitive,” she said. “This is not a competition and we’ve really fostered a community.”
The startup services varied, but many attendants said they came up with their idea through a similar process: identifying a need and finding a way to fix it.
“We solved our problem, we built an app,” said Sam Marley of Northeastern University who is one of the founders of Blurr, a photo-sharing app. “But more importantly, we realized people loved it.”
Harvard VentureWorks, a subdivision of Harvard Ventures that provides resources for campus startups, helped organize the event.
“VentureWorks serves as the bridge between you working with an idea, your dorm, and the iLab,” Pleat said.
Others school that participated in the event host similar accelerators and resource groups for student startups. MIT organizer Lisette Tellez said even though this was the first time StartLabs, an MIT group, participated in the Pitch Off, students had pitched their ideas at similar events.
“The joke is that there’s so much going on it’s impossible for you to do everything,” Tellez said. “But we’ve never done anything with this many other schools like this, so this is super exciting.”

Aiming to bring awareness to youth homelessness through artwork, the Y2Y homeless shelter hosted an art exhibition on Saturday as part of this weekend’s Arts First Festival.
Featuring pieces made by guests and volunteers, as well as some donated by local high school students, the showcase also aimed to showcase Y2Y’s recent initiative to promote art as a both a skill and a means of creative expression.
The initiative started when local art teacher Evmorphia Stratis read the Boston Globe Magazine’s “Bostonians of the Year” last December and saw an honorable mention of Y2Y founders, Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 and Samuel G. Greenberg ’14.
Upon learning of the youth homeless shelter’s opening in Harvard Square, Stratis said she was immediately impressed and wanted to get involved.
“I sent in my resume, came in and talked to them, and said ‘I’d love to offer a class, volunteer once a week, and have an open arts session,’” Stratis said.
Over the past several months, Stratis has held a weekly class at Y2Y, which she said has explored various art styles and encouraged free expression.
“When you have a place like this you kind of want to give people the space to do what they want to do, and to express themselves visually, without words, which is important a lot of times too,” Stratis said.
After several classes, the shelter’s volunteers wanted to display the art that the class had produced.
“We reached out to the Office for the Arts after Evmorphia’s class had been running every week and we had a great collection of really diverse pieces from several of the shelter’s guests and volunteers,” Y2Y volunteer Lance Johnson ’18 said. “We thought it would be a great idea to show this to the public and really reveal its value.”
The exhibit featured several drawings and paintings by the class, depicting landscapes, still-lifes, and abstract and expressionist art. It also included a re-creation of the Y2Y facility made on Minecraft, a building game, by a guest of the shelter.
In addition, pottery and pieces made from food packaging were donated by Beacon High School in Watertown, Mass., to raise awareness for hunger. The school will eventually sell the art and donate the proceeds to Y2Y.
“We saw this as a great opportunity to showcase the creative expression which normally goes unseen and kind of give a public voice to a very unique and very powerful experience that can manifest itself in really beautiful works we have here,” Johnson said.

Director Alex Gibney called for a national debate on cyber warfare at a screening of “Zero Hour,” his documentary on the details of a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program.
The Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs hosted the screening Friday. The documentary is partly based on research on clandestine warfare by David E. Sanger ’82, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times and a former Crimson editor, and features interviews with Belfer affiliates such as Executive Director for Research Gary Samore and Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a senior research fellow at the Kennedy School.
“Zero Days” lays out the events leading to the cyber attack on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in 2009. The U.S. military, with aid from its Israeli counterparts, developed computer malware to impair Iran’s nuclear program, according to the documentary. The malware ended up spreading beyond the nuclear facility.
Gibney began his research for the film based on his interest in cyber conflict. As he investigated further into the attack, however, he became more concerned with the political ramifications of the documentary.
“There was a whole world of threat that was all around us that I hadn’t at all appreciated,” he said.
The screening was followed by a panel with Gibney and Sanger, who is also an adjunct lecturer at the Kennedy School, that addressed issues the documentary details. Much of the panel focused on the potential danger of cyber warfare.
“Once cyber crosses into the realm of the physical, then it’s a physical attack, but it starts with cyber. And the idea of a cyber attack being able to take control of machines—that becomes a scary process,” Sanger said.
Gibney expressed his hope that the documentary would spark a national discussion about what he called the secrecy surrounding the cyber attack on Iran.
“I was hoping to provoke people to say, ‘Enough of the secrecy.’ The secrecy is putting us all at risk,” Gibney said.
Kilian M. Blum, a graduate student at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts who attended the event, said the movie not only focused on the use of cyber weaponry but also the politics involved in the conflict.
“I think the movie found a good balance between simplifying very complex affairs and still make it interesting even for a moderately informed audience,” Blum said. “It gave a broad overview on both the cyber side and the international relations side of the issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Layla B. Stahr ’17 powered up her computer last week, she planned to start writing the paper that she had woken up early to complete. What she did not expect to find, however, was an email announcing her selection to Harvard’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest undergraduate honors society in the United States.
“I called my dad and told him; he was driving to work,” Stahr, a Neurobiology concentrator in Mather House, said. “That was cool.”
Stahr was one of 24 juniors who received the award, “an honor bestowed on those whose coursework demonstrates not only high achievement, but also breadth of interest, depth of understanding, and intellectual honesty,” according to the chapter’s website. Jeffrey Berg, assistant director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, announced the awardees in an email last week.
The juniors study a wide range of fields, from Physics to Philosophy, and History and Literature to Neurobiology. Ten of the 24 students study in the Sciences Division, while six study in the Social Sciences Division, four in the Arts and Humanities Division, and four in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. 
Pforzheimer House and Mather House had the highest representation among the group of students, with four students from each of the Houses receiving the honor. Neither Dunster House nor Lowell House had students represented in this year’s selection.
Jeff R. Metzger ’17, a Government concentrator in Mather House, described his reaction to his selection as a combination of “honestly a lot of disbelief” and “overwhelming happiness.”
“I would have never expected it, to be honest,” he said.
Beyond the initial shock of receiving the award, several of the honorees emphasized how gratified they felt to receive an honor for both the breadth and depth of their academic interests.
“What the award really means to me is a validation of all of the many influences that went into my education,” said Bo Seo ’17, a Social Studies concentrator in Pforzheimer House who also won the 2016 world debating championship. “I’ve come across the most kind of stunning range of thinkers and teachers and mentors, and that’s been the really special part of Harvard for me.”
“I know there’s a lot of talented people at Harvard,” Daniel H. Rothchild ’17, a Physics concentrator in Adams House, said. “And so I’m thankful to my department and to my professors who have helped me get to this point.”
Many of the awardees said that the honor reaffirms their approach to pursuing interdisciplinary work.
For Stahr, coming to college represented an opportunity to study a variety of interests.
“[Each semester], I’ve been really lucky to… pick a class that’s been just kind of random, that doesn’t necessarily count toward my concentration,” she said, adding that those niche interests include behavioral pharmacology and game theory. She said she hopes to take more classes in the Computer Science and Visual and Environmental Studies departments during her last semesters as an undergraduate next year.
“The problem is you only get 32 classes, and… as a freshman… you kind of figure out a path for yourself,” Hans D. Gaebler ’17, a Mathematics concentrator in Pforzheimer House, said. “Suddenly you’re a senior and you have only eight classes left…. It would be nice to explore things that are a little more off… of the path that gets laid out for you when you choose your concentration.”
Seo, too, said he has tried to take an interdisciplinary approach to his coursework, adding that the Phi Beta Kappa honor does not represent the end of his exploration.
“It doesn’t simplify the uncertainties I still have about my studies,” Seo wrote in a message. “But it does encourage me to keep asking challenging questions and to pursue a genuine, interdisciplinary education.”
Here is the full list of Phi Beta Kappa’s “Junior 24.” According to students, they will be honored at a dinner in Leverett House on Monday, May 2:
Dhruva Bhat ’17, Economics (Eliot)
Marc R. Bornstein ’17, Chemistry & Physics (Pforzheimer)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council considered legislation Sunday to gather data from the Office of Student Life about the requirements students must complete in order to join organizations.
During Sunday’s UC meeting—the final one of the academic year—representatives debated the requirements, commonly referred to as clubs’ “comp” processes, and whether the Council should have oversight over such processes.
“For a lot of people, comping processes are incredibly stressful. There are a lot of processes that aren't necessarily equitable,” UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said. “If we’re interested in creating a dialogue about why there are requirements and if those requirements are just or necessary, then initiating a call for information is definitely warranted.”
Mather House representative Yehong Zhu ’18 suggested that the Council work to create a student evaluation system for club comp processes, akin to the Q guide that students currently use to evaluate courses and instructors.
“This is clearly an issue that is close to people's hearts and that everyone experiences,” UC Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18, who co-sponsored the legislation with Greenlaw, said. “We want to institute a way to learn more about comp processes.”
Representatives raised questions about what constituted a fair comp process; for instance, some representatives questioned whether considering a student’s GPA when determining club membership was permissible.
“There has to be a… line between academics and extracurriculars,” Elm Yard Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said.
Other representatives cautioned the Council against trying to exert too much control over student organizations.
“I think that we should not overstep our bounds and tell a particular club what they can or cannot approve people based on,” UC Parliamentarian Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said.
Brown said she wanted to collect information from both student organizations and from students who participated in comp processes to better understand membership requirements before making a decision on how to move forward.
The Council ultimately voted to table the legislation, with UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 saying that “this is something we'll definitely talk about more in the fall when we come back to campus.”
The UC also passed legislation to allocate $750 of the Council’s Crazy Ideas Fund—used recently to fund Club 1636—to provide free coffee to students outside of Lamont Library every weekday night this week between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m.
Crimson Yard Representative Nicholas Whittaker ’19, who sponsored the legislation, said he hoped the UC could serve between 100 and 150 cups per night.
Some representatives argued that the bill was not the best use of Council funds, noting that students can get coffee for free in dining halls or purchase it in Lamont Cafe with BoardPlus. Ultimately, 31 representatives voted in favor of the legislation, and 7 voted against it.
The Council also passed legislation from the Freshman Class Committee to allocate $1,600 to purchase four Xbox One game consoles and controllers for freshman dorms. Bonsall pointed to results from a survey of the freshman class indicating that between 75 and 94 percent of freshmen would want video game systems in dorm common rooms.
Earlier in the meeting, students from Satire V and On Harvard Time staged a satirical protest against the Council, interrupting Rather’s presidential updates to put forth a sole demand: “Don’t be bad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Finishing with the most wins in a single season would be an impressive feat. Adding having the record set for goals in a season by a rookie and the winningest senior class in program, and the recipe is primed for success.
Coach Ted Minnis had nothing but words of praise for his team before the CWPA Div I/II Championship Tournament, hosted at Blodgett Pool this weekend, was even over.
“This is the best team that Harvard women’s water polo has ever had,” Minnis said.
The No. 18 Crimson (24-10) can now add a sixth-place finish at the year-end tournament to its 2016 resume.
Harvard opened the tournament with a loss to No. 17 Princeton (19-7) before defeating Connecticut College (15-9) and George Washington (8-19). With a fifth-place finish on the line, however, the injury-plagued Crimson fell in its season-finale to No. 20 Bucknell (18-5), by four goals, to settle for a sixth-place finish.
“We didn’t really have any extra field-player subs, [but] the team really stepped up and gave it our all,” sophomore attacker Sami Strutner said. “Even the though this weekend might not have turned out the way we wanted it to, it doesn’t define our season. We had a great season.”
BUCKNELL 11, HARVARD 7
Senior attacker Eleanor Marrs and sophomore utility Marta Considine led the Bison with a pair of hat tricks to down a depleted Crimson team, 11-7, to close out the season on Sunday morning.
“They do a great job,” Minnis said. “They’re well coached. They subbed early and later on in the game, they got some counter-goals and we just didn’t have any gas left to swim with them.”
Several of Harvard’s key players were unable to enter the pool, giving the Crimson only seven field players to work with at one point.
“I’m super proud of the way our team has been able to play this weekend, with the circumstances of so many people being out,” said captain Yoshi Andersen, playing her final game with Harvard. “Everybody who was able to play was playing with so much heart. People who weren’t able to play were so supportive.”
Freshman attacker Kristen Hong led the Crimson with a hat trick, while senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix tacked on a pair.
Hong’s 12-goal weekend upped her season total to 80 goals, setting a program record.
Hendrix, Andersen, and senior attacker Rachel Lobato leave Blodgett with 77 wins as a class, also a program record.
“I couldn’t ask for two better classmates to spend [my four years] with,” Andersen said. “Definitely, I’m leaving feeling very grateful for everything that’s happened since I’ve been here.”
HARVARD 11, GEORGE WASHINGTON 6
Hong and Hendrix replicated exactly their performances from just hours prior by scoring four goals each to help the Crimson to an 11-6 victory over George Washington (8-19).
After facing an early 1-0 deficit less than a minute in, Harvard pulled back to lead 2-1 after one quarter and never looked back.
Sophomore utility Scarlet Hallahan led the way for the Colonials with two goals. Andersen tacked on a pair on the other end of the pool to help the Crimson advance to the fifth-place game against Bucknell.
HARVARD 13, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 3
Up against the lowest-ranked team, Harvard put on a clinic in the first half, snapping the back of the net eight times for an 8-1 halftime lead. The Crimson slowed down in the second half, running down the entire shot clock on several of its possessions, to walk away with a 13-3 victory over Connecticut College (15-9) and keep its hopes alive for a fifth-place finish.
Hong and Hendrix led the way with four goals apiece for Harvard, while in the absence of enough field-player subs, backup freshman goalie Sam Acker entered the game and tallied a goal. Sophomore Cleo Harrington made 17 stops in between the pipes.
The Camels, by virtue of being the 2016 CWPA Div III Champions, its third straight title, played into the tournament as the ninth and lowest seed.
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 8
Harvard opened the tournament with yet another shot at breaking its 23-game losing streak to defending CWPA champion No. 17 Princeton (19-7).
The Tigers outscored the Crimson 3-2 in both of the first two quarters, taking a 6-4 halftime lead. Despite the close score, Princeton charged out of the break with a string of goals in the third to put a dent into Harvard’s hopes. Led by sophomore attacker Haley Wan’s hat trick, Princeton upped its lead to 11-5 in the fourth quarter to ice its 24th straight win over its CWPA rivals.
The Crimson tallied three straight to make it interesting in the fourth, but the Tigers held on to win, 12-8.
Andersen led Harvard with three goals, including two straight that re-energized the team in the fourth quarter, while Strutner and freshman attacker Nikki Daurio each contributed a pair.
The final minutes also featured an unusual call. A goal by Daurio with 4:17 to go in the game, which would have made the score 11-8 and kept the comeback momentum rolling, was waived off after the officials granted Princeton a timeout.
A chorus of boos was heard from the home crowd, but Minnis downplayed the issue of the Tigers not having possession when calling the timeout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team found itself in a position that was both exciting and daunting this weekend. Facing off against its archrival, the Crimson had the chance to decide its own fate—come away with a win and the team would qualify for the Ivy League tournament, lose and the season would be over.
In the end, Harvard made the decision with conviction. The Crimson (9-6, 4-3 Ivy) topped perennial rival Yale (5-10, 2-5) with an ease that belied the gravity of the situation, brushing aside the Bulldogs, 13-4, on Saturday in New Haven, Conn. The victory saw Harvard finish fourth in the conference standings to make it to the Ancient Eight tournament for the third season in a row and the fifth time in six years.
“Today was a great day all around,” junior midfielder Megan Hennessey said. “It was a good team win. We are really excited to be going back to the Ivy tournament, as it is always our goal.”
The victory resulted from a team-wide effort from the Crimson, with Harvard shining both defensively and on attack.
“We executed the game plan well,” said co-captain and starting goalie Kelly Weis. “We hunkered down on defense and didn't allow them to drive to cage easily, and the offense moved the ball well and was able to finish their shots.”
The Crimson senior netminder anchored the team at the back, turning away 11 of Yale’s 15 attempts on goal.
Led by Weis, the Crimson back line managed to shut down the key to the Bulldogs’ offense, junior attacker Tess McEvoy, who tallied just two points on the day. Only six teams have limited McEvoy to two points or fewer this season, and Harvard is one of two squads on that list that is not nationally ranked.
With Yale’s offense limited, the Crimson attack was able to run away with the game. Harvard tallied 31 shots, compared to the Bulldogs’ 16, and five Crimson players collected two points or more, including hat tricks from Hennessey and junior attacker Maeve McMahon.
Junior attacker Marisa Romeo also chipped in two scores and four assists to continue her run of prolific scoring form.
“[Romeo was] fantastic,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “She was patient, ran the offense, found open cutters, re-defended well, and took the one-on-one when it was there.”
On the back of a standout performance from its attackers, Harvard quickly marched away to a decisive lead that it would never surrender.
Senior attacker Alexis Nicolia opened the scoring six minutes after the opening whistle, and the Crimson was ahead by seven points before the Bulldogs found the back of the net for the first time.
Prior to Yale’s first score, Nicolia had put away a second goal, while Hennessey had picked up two of her own and McMahon had already completed her hat trick.
Bulldogs’ sophomore midfielder Katie Smith finally snapped the string of unanswered Harvard points from a free position opportunity with 12 seconds remaining in the first half before the whistle blew to send the Crimson into the intermission ahead, 7-1.
The second period followed a very similar pattern, as Harvard quickly added to its advantage before Yale was able to strike back.
Hennessey scored for the third time just over 30 seconds after the restart to spark a run of five unanswered goals for the Crimson that would see sophomore attacker Caroline Ashford and Romeo each pick up a brace of finishes. Hennessey concluded Harvard’s streak and her scoring for the night with a fourth goal that stretched the Crimson’s margin to 12.
Yale would recover slightly once again at the end of the stanza, and the Bulldogs managed to end their second-period drought in the final 10 minutes of the contest with a strike from sophomore attacker Kiwi Comizio and two finishes from McEvoy.
The Harvard offense had already put the result out of reach, though, and the final whistle blew just after McEvoy’s second goal to quash the Bulldogs’ comeback bid and keep Harvard playing for another week.
Concluding the regular season with such a decisive victory will provide the Crimson with some much-needed momentum as the team enters the league tournament, which will be held next weekend in Philadelphia.
“It feels good to have a big win going into the tournament,” Weis said. “Some games haven't gone our way the past few weeks, so it was great to get a solid win before heading down to Penn next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the three seniors competing in this weekend's regatta, their final hurrah was far from the best performance of their careers.
In the final week of the regular season, the Harvard sailing team was unable to clinch a postseason berth at the New England Dinghy Championships in Hanover, N.H. after posting twelfth place result in the 18 school field.  A top-nine finish was required for the Crimson to qualify for the ICSA Nationals Championships at San Diego Yacht Club in June.  Harvard’s 78-point performance did not surpass the 65-point threshold achieve such a result.
Sailing in FJs and Z420s in the bi-divisional Coast Guard Alumni Bowl, the Crimson was led by fellow seniors, skipper Andrew Mollerus and crew Sydney Karnovsky in the A-Division, while senior skipper Marek Zaleski and junior crew Julia Lord sailed in the B-Division.  The group, who all competed in the event last year, was unable to best their previous sixth place finish from one year ago.
With each division only sailing four total races each on the weekend, the stakes were high for each individual event.  Mollerus and Karnovsky were unable to take advantage from the high-risk situation.  Although posting sixth and seventh place finishes in their middle two races, their first and final results were 13th and 14th, respectively.  Their 40 total points were good enough for 12th among the division.
In the B-Division, Zaleski and Lord were able to finish on a high note.  After scoring 11th, 11th, and 12th in their first three races of the weekend, they produced a fourth place result in their fourth and final event.  By the end of the weekend, the duo had put forth a tenth place, 38-point performance.  Although tying with ninth place Bowdoin in aggregate score, Zaleski and Lord fell short on a tiebreaker based on the number of high place finishes.
Roger Williams won the day with their 41-point result, after taking the lead from Coast Guard Academy in the very final race of the weekend.  Boston University, Coast Guard, Boston College, Yale, Tufts, Dartmouth, Connecticut College, and Brown rounded out the qualifying schools.
Following this result, Harvard will look to make a name of itself at the ICSA National Women’s Championship from in late May, the only postseason regatta that the Crimson qualified for this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of the squad rested in preparation for the outdoor Ivy League championships next weekend, the Harvard track and field team sent a small delegation of athletes to the Penn Relays and Stonehill Skyhawk Invitational this past weekend. The team came home with a bevy of first-place finishes.
“Because we had the Ivy League championships next weekend... we had a small contingent competing,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “Those who competed I thought did really well, and we had some outstanding performances.”
PENN RELAYS
The Crimson women’s performance at the Penn Relays was highlighted by junior indoor All-American Nikki Okwelogu, who claimed first in the women’s shot put with a throw of 56’3.75”.
Notably, Okwelogu defeated Tennessee All-American Cassie Wertman, who claimed second place—above Okwelogu’s bronze-medal finish—at the indoor NCAA championships in March.
“Nikki’s a tremendous competitor,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great to see her matched up against…one of the few people that beat her in the indoor nationals back in March, and for her to come out on top was a great victory.”
Sophomore Fiona Davis also performed well in the 10K—her first time running the race—placing 18th with a time of 37:01.84.
“[Davis] made her debut in the 10K and ran an outstanding time,” Saretsky said. “25 laps is a long way to go, and she did really well.”
On the men’s side, the weekend was highlighted by a strong performance from freshman Kieran Tuntivate, who shaved nearly 30 seconds off his personal best on the way to a 22nd place finish.
The men also sent freshman Collin Price and sophomore Tyler Spear to run the 10K, where Price and Spear ran neck-and-neck to respectively score 48th and 49th place finishes.
STONEHILL INVITE
The women’s squad also sent two athletes, sophomore Sophia Iosue and freshman Miranda Sadler, to the Stonehill Invite. There, Sadler claimed second place in the 800-meter dash with a personal best of 2:13.25. Iosue threw for 111’2” in the discus on her way to a tie for fifth-place.
The Crimson trio of senior Malik Epps, junior Thomas Negron, and freshman Liam Hackett scored a one-two-three finish in the 800-meter dash. All three times were personal bests.
“It felt great to be able to go out there, even without that much competition, and show that I can do a lot by myself,” Epps said. “I’d been hurt for a long time, including my entire junior year, so if anything it was kind of a relief.”
Harvard also landed gold medals in the 100-meter dash and men’s hammer, courtesy of sophomore Tomoya Hasegawa and junior Josh Whitener.
In the 100-meter, Hasegawa set a new personal record of 11.26 seconds, just ahead of senior David Gawlas, who ran a 11.30 on his way to a third place finish.
Elsewhere, freshman Nathan Williams ran a career-best 8:51.44 in the 3000-meter run on his way to a bronze medal. Fellow rookie Mitch Valko came home with a silver medal in the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 15.10 seconds.
Classmate Garrett Rouser landed a silver medal in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 56.08 seconds, ahead of junior Alex Kirby, who ran a 57.33 on his way to fifth place.
“We had some great performances at the Stonehill as well,” Saretsky said. “I was really impressed—it was great to see those guys get that competitive experience.”
Next weekend, the Crimson men hope to improve on their fifth-place finish at the indoor Ivy League championships in February. Meanwhile, the Crimson women—currently ranked the tenth best team in the nation, the highest ever by an Ivy League team—look to defend their outdoor Ivy League title from last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To find the last time that the Harvard men’s lacrosse team owned a four-game winning streak against Yale, you would have to go back to the 1990s, when current coach Chris Wojcik ’96 was still a player for the Crimson.
Exactly 20 years after captaining Harvard to an 18-15 away win over the Bulldogs and a second-round exit in the NCAA Tournament in one of the program’s best seasons in history, Wojcik returned to New Haven once again on Saturday afternoon.
A victory would not only push the Crimson into a tie for second place in the Ivy, but also make Wojcik part of a four game winning streak over Yale for the second time.
For 50 minutes, everything went according to plan for his squad. Harvard held an 8-4 lead after sophomore attacker Morgan Cheek scored his fourth goal of the afternoon with 11:03 remaining in the final quarter, and had a chance to end an up-and-down season on a high note by holding on against the Bulldogs.
By the next time the Crimson brought the ball into Yale territory, however, the score had been tied at 8-8. Junior midfielder Eric Scott took over the game, scoring or assisting on four straight goals to bring his team all the way back.
Then, with all the momentum on their side, the Bulldogs struck again to take the lead.
Harvard couldn’t find a way to respond, allowing No. 6/6 Yale (11-2, 5-1 Ivy) to complete the comeback victory and secure sole possession of second place in the conference. It will play 3-seed Penn in the semifinals of the Ivy tournament this Friday.
The Crimson (7-7, 3-3), meanwhile, remains in the fourth spot and faces a daunting challenge against 1-seed Brown, which went undefeated in conference play this season.
“We competed as well as we could, and there were a lot of positives to be taken from the game,” Wojcik said. “We know we can match up with anyone, but we have to do it for the full 60 minutes.”
Harvard came out as the stronger team, preventing the Bulldogs’ offense, ranked eighth in the nation in goals per game, from getting a single shot on goal during the first quarter. The Crimson offense took advantage, taking a quick 3-0 lead on the strength of two goals from Cheek.
“The coaches drew up a great game plan for us, and it worked perfectly at the start of the game,” co-captain and defender Stephen Jahelka said. “We made sure to be really deliberate with our movements, being aggressive and not letting them get into a rhythm.”
Yale responded with three straight goals of its own in the second quarter to level the score. Sophomore attacker Ben Reeves, who ranks fifth in the Ivy in both goals and assists per game, matched Cheek with two tallies of his own.
Cheek answered right away, however, scoring again to complete a first half hat trick less than a minute after Reeves tied the game. Cheek’s goal swung the momentum back to Harvard, which went on a 5-1 run to take a commanding 8-4 lead.
The Crimson capitalized on strong play from freshman faceoff specialist James Sullivan, who helped the team earn a 3-2 edge in faceoff wins in the second and third quarters.
“Our players pieced together some really good possessions, and I was pleased by how we were able to control possession right from the X,” Wojcik said. “He’s [Sullivan] shown a lot of improvement since the beginning of the season, and to come out in a big game like this and perform is great for him.”
Sullivan went on to win three more faceoffs in the fourth quarter, but the three he lost all led to Bulldogs goals as they fought back to tie the game.
Yale’s ninth score by senior attackman Shane Carr then put Yale in the lead for good, as Harvard could not find the back of the net for the final three minutes of the contest.
“We have another game to play, and we’ll learn and move on from this,” Jahelka said. “Games like this happen, and we just have to make sure it doesn’t happen in the tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hard defensive play has been the signature of the Harvard women’s rugby team all season. This weekend was no different. After securing a spot in May’s USA Rugby College 7’s National Championships last weekend, the team played every game within a score this weekend in the Varsity 7’s Championships. The Crimson also managed to  hold every team under 20 points.
Harvard competed against seven other schools in the Varsity 7’s Championships at West Point. The Crimson, having won the Ivy 7’s Championship last weekend, was the top-ranked team in its pool which consisted of Dartmouth, Army, and Navy. The other pool included top-ranked AIC, Norwich, Brown, and West Chester. Harvard went 1-3 on the day, losing twice in pool play before being edged out by AIC in the semifinal game.
“[It was] obviously not the outcome we wanted,” freshman Grace Chao said. “But even in some of our toughest games...we kept fighting....and it in no way diminishes the incredible progress we made this season.”
AIC, 15, Harvard, 12
The Crimson have played AIC twice this sevens season and both times, Harvard played the Yellow Jackets within three points. However, the Crimson was on the losing side in each contest. The last time Harvard took on AIC, it lost 10-7 at the Quinnipiac 7’s tournament.
The Crimson began the game with a 40-meter try by senior Aniebiet Abasi. This was the third game of four that Abasi downed Harvard’s first try. The Crimson went up 5-0, but AIC tied it up just before the half. Early in the second frame, AIC took a 10-5 lead. However, senior Lydia Burns put Harvard up 12-10 after a try and successful conversion. With 40 seconds left in the game, the Crimson was up, but a line break allowed the Yellow Jackets to score. AIC scored the game-winning try, taking the semifinal 15-12.
“I feel great about the team’s play,” sophomore co-captain Maya Learned said. “They did really well. They a really great match against AIC...the first seed in the tournament…. It was a very close game, really well done by everyone out on the field.”
Navy, 17, Harvard, 10
Abasi began her dominant weekend against Navy, downing the opening try on an 80-meter score. Freshman Caitlin Weigel, who has been a force in sevens, increased the lead to 10-0 at half. However, Navy countered with a strong second half attack, tying the score at 10. Penalties allowed Navy to score the go-ahead try in the final minutes to secure the victory.
Harvard 19, Dartmouth, 0
Harvard continued its solid play against Ancient Eight schools, shutting out Dartmouth in its lone win of the day. The Crimson has shut out nine of its opponents in its 17 wins during this sevens season.
“Defense in sevens rugby is all about work rate and just getting yourself in front of the ball,” Learned said. “That’s something our team...really commits to...having the best work rate out of any team.”
Army, 17, Harvard, 10
The trend of the weekend appeared to be Abasi opening the scoring for the Crimson. Out of the four games played, Abasi scored the opening try in three of them. Against Army, Abasi’s first try countered Army’s opening score to get Harvard within two at 7-5. Abasi took the ball 100 meters into the endzone to put the Crimson on the board. However, the Cadets scored before halftime to go up 12-5.
Army extended the lead early in the second half, but sophomore Dalton Youngblood, following Abasi’s example, went 100 meters for the score to bring the Crimson within seven. Army’s defense, however, held strong, taking the game, 17-10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 2, 2016, at 2:03 a.m.
In popular imagination and in reality, Harvard seniors graduate to positions of power.
Some land on Wall Street or Capitol Hill. Others spread out to top graduate schools across the country. Others still march into the headquarters of high-profile corporations.
But now, in increasing numbers, these graduates are flocking to a somewhat less traditional sector: professional football.
Last Saturday, for the second time in the last four years, a Harvard player heard his name called in the NFL Draft.
In 2013, the man was Kyle Juszczyk, and the team was the Baltimore Ravens. Since then, Juszczyk, who has a stocky tight end for the Crimson, has converted into a fullback and seen significant playing time for the Ravens.
This time, in 2016, the man is Cole Toner, and the team is the Arizona Cardinals. While Toner faces the uncertainty of training camp, he can take solace in the 6’4” form of Matt Birk, a former Crimson center who parlayed college stardom into sustained success with the Ravens.
However, Toner was not the only Harvard player to receive an important phone call over the weekend.
During the fall, tight end Ben Braunecker led the Crimson in virtually every receiving category, and during the winter, he put on an impressive show at the NFL combine, ranking as one of the most athletic tight ends in his class.
Although some analysts had projected the Indiana native as a fourth-round pick, Braunecker had to wait until the draft ended to sign with a team. That’s when the Chicago Bears snatched up the unpicked rookie.
Offensive linemen Anthony Fabiano and Adam Redmond experienced a similar narrative: silence during the draft followed by a speedy phone call. Soon after the final round concluded, Fabiano signed with the Ravens while Redmond joined the Colts—the same team that claimed defensive tackle Zack Hodges last year.
All told, the four Harvard players headed to the NFL is the largest number in the modern era. That scale testifies both to the consistent success of the team and to the track record of graduates such as Juszczyk, Birk, and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, all of whom have panned out at the professional level.
Meanwhile, at the level of the offensive line, the signing success of the three seniors indicates just how good that unit was for the Crimson last year.
The mass departure creates an undeniable hole for the Harvard program. But given the growing Crimson-to-NFL pipeline, it seems unlikely that the hole will last for much longer.

It seems like Malia Obama just can’t get enough of Harvard.
After touring campus last spring, then visiting again last semester, Malia will study at  Harvard College starting in 2017.
2017? Yup, she’s taking a gap year. I guess that means one year less of our friendship.
Rumors about Malia’s much-anticipated college decision started swirling yesterday after an image of her wearing a Harvard t-shirt spread like wildfire on social media, about which the media outlet the Tab reported.
Early Sunday morning the White House announced officially that Malia will attend Harvard. Having the White House announce your college decision sure beats that Facebook status I posted (which got a lot of likes!) announcing my decision.
Malia will make up part of Harvard College’s Class of 2021, a class year that makes me feel really old, even though I’m only a sophomore.
She will continue the Obama family tradition of claiming Harvard as their stomping grounds. Both of Malia’s parents (Mr. President and the First Lady, in case you were not already aware) attended Harvard Law School.
The elephant in the room though: given this tradition of Obamas at Harvard, will Sasha, Malia’s 14-year old sister, feel pressure to go to the same school? Only time will tell.
Malia, if you’re reading this, comp The Crimson. I promise we’re fun and normal. Follow me on Twitter too: @ignacio_sabate.

Flyby exec and amateur astrologist Kyle E. O’Hara counts many things among her talents—her impressive ability to drink Diet Coke before 10 a.m., her dogged pursuit of the position of El Jefe’s #1 customer, and her remarkable skill at napping at inopportune times. But most prominent of these talents is her questionable-at-best ESP. Check back on the first of each month for your Flyby Horoscope, courtesy of Kyle.
The stars have provided a different brand of inspiration this month. I’m here to report what summer job you should have based on your sign. If the opportunity you’ve found doesn’t match what I’ve reported here, you might want to check your birth certificate and make sure you didn’t misremember your birthday. This is a foolproof science.

GEMINI: You may not have a job yet, but good things are coming your way. Just stay optimistic and keep scheduling interviews. Everything is going to work out.
CANCER: Whatever you’ll be doing, Cancer, I’m glad to report that it’s something you care about. Congrats on evading stereotypes and finding fulfillment in your career.
LEO: Working for a nonprofit? That’s awesome! Please just don't put it in your Tinder bio.
VIRGO: Backpacking across Europe is most definitely not a job, but have fun anyway. You’re going to have the best stories come September.
LIBRA: Libra, how are you so chill about still not even knowing where you’re going to live this summer? Yolo-ing summer plans is definitely fun, but you’re cutting it close.
SCORPIO: You may be another Harvard stereotype, but at least you’re not going into consulting. Congratulations on the dope CS internship.
SAGITTARIUS: Where do you even find such a bizarre, off-the-wall internship like that? You’re definitely the most successful Crimson Careers user on this campus.
CAPRICORN: Glad to hear your startup is taking off, Capricorn. Being your own boss for the summer is going to be tons of fun.
AQUARIUS: Taking the summer off to focus on yourself definitely counts as a job, and you’re probably going to be the most successful in the long term.
