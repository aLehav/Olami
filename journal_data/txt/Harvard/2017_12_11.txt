After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, Nov. 6, Khizr Khan promoted his new book, “An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice,” at First Parish Church in Harvard Square. Khan, a Pakistani-American lawyer and Gold Star father, is best known for denouncing then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in a rousing speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Khan discussed the contents of his memoir with Harvard Law School professor Martha Minow before taking questions from the audience. A skilled raconteur, Khan captivated event-goers with reflections on his early reverence of the United States, the events leading up to his famed speech, and the upstanding character of his late son Captain Humayun Khan.
Khizr Khan recalled being first exposed to the founding documents of the United States as a University of Punjab law student in 1972. Living under martial law in Pakistan, he dared not even step outside without the consent of the authoritarian state. As a result, he was intrigued by the language of the Declaration of Independence. “I thought, who declares independence? Independence is given,” Khan recounted. Until reading the Declaration of Independence, Khan had understood independence as something granted at the discretion of a colonial power following the complete exhaustion of a region’s resources. To declare one’s own independence seemed to be the mark of an exceptionally advanced nation. “I fell in love with the Declaration of Independence first,” he explained, “then the Constitution, and then the Bill of Rights… Rule of law [and] equal protection of law [have] elevated this nation to a place where it has become an aspiration for the rest of the world.”
From there, Khan recounted, his admiration for the United States only grew. In addition to the beauty of its founding documents, Khan was struck by the kindness of the country’s citizens. After moving from Pakistan to Dubai, Khan could only afford to rent a small room in which he slept on the floor. But his American boss, who noticed his exhaustion, offered him free lodging in a furnished apartment meant for Western expatriates. “Every time I think of that moment, I lose my composure,” Khan admitted. “He owed me nothing.” Khan developed a connection to America that was both intellectual and emotional. His opinion of the country did not diminish after his immigration in 1980. Even getting a driver’s license from the DMV reaffirmed his faith in American rule of law: “Everyone had to come through the door, get a number, and wait. That was so impressive, because where I come from, there are classes of people. [In America] the human being is raised up to a level of dignity that the rest of mankind wishes to have.”
Reflecting on the nationwide resurgence of white supremacy, Khan maintained his hopeful outlook. Though horrified by the violent far-right rally that ravaged his new hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia this summer, he was heartened by the response of those who stood united against bigotry. He was moved in particular by the tens of thousands of Bostonians who flocked to the streets to demonstrate against racial hatred.
Khan’s love for America does not translate, however, to acceptance of the Trump administration. “We have every right to criticize the White House when they show incompetency,” he said. “Those are our tax dollars [at work].” Khan went on to condemn Donald Trump for his response to the recent killing of four American soldiers in Niger. He also criticized White House chief of staff John Kelly, himself a Gold Star father, for failing to advise Trump of the proper way to express his condolences to the soldiers’ families: “[John Kelly] knows better than anyone else what is required at that moment … his obligation [was] to restrain the president from using that moment for political expediency.”
During his question and answer session, Khan was confronted by an audience member who accused him of supporting a war criminal and being a pawn for the Democratic Party. Khan gave his earnest opinion on the American invasion of Iraq. Although he had personally opposed both Gulf Wars, he wanted to honor his son for his service and sacrifice. Khan’s response to the latter accusation was measured but unambiguous. “I wrote that speech,” he said. “I’m an articulate person.” He went on to describe staying up all night to write a twelve-page draft of his speech, which his wife Ghazala helped him shorten to 260 words. “The very first line of the original speech … was ‘These are my words. I have not plagiarized from Michelle Obama,’” Khan quipped, referring to Melania Trump’s 2016 Republican National Convention speech, which had marked similarities to a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama.
Several audience members, including Blessing H. Jee ’17-18, reported that Khan’s event had reaffirmed their confidence in the United States. “I think it was just very invigorating to hear [about] Khizr Khan’s love for the Constitution,” she said. “[The Constitution is] something that I take for granted or don’t really think about … in my day-to-day [life], but this definitely has made me appreciate more the kind of state under which I live, even if sometimes the political realities feel so horrible.”
Sathvik Sudireddy ’19, who attended the event with several other members of the Harvard South Asian Association, expressed a similar sentiment. “I think the way Khizr Khan was raised is very similar to a lot of the ways many parents of South Asians here have been raised. … Seeing that example of what he did … reminds us of our parents, and the story of his son … reminds us of why we’re here and what our duty is to this nation.”
Carissa J. Chen ’21, another audience member, was also impressed by the event. “I remember listening to [Khan’s] speech [at the Democratic National Convention] last year and being really moved by what he said … I’m really glad I came,” she said.

To share every quote from “They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us” that is enticingly beautiful or haunting would be to write no review at all, but rather to print an abridged serving of words from Hanif Abdurraqib’s first collection of essays. The spoken word poet’s pieces are deep, uncensored analyses of topics ranging from music to death, from culture to sports, saturated with the weight of his memories and experiences. Each essay is a masterful account of what it means to experience culture and current events in a black body, in a country that so often demands black silence. He writes, “We are nothing without our quick and simple blessings, without those willing to drag optimism by its neck to the gates of grief and ask to be let in.” While Abdurraqib does not hold back the pain, the loss, the injustice, and the grief of this world, he draws attention to the small joys through which we can survive it.
There is something precious in how Abdurraqib’s writing transcends changes in emotion and in tone to flow so seamlessly from one topic to the next, as evidenced by his opening four essays. He navigates effortlessly from his first, an insightful description of the optimism of Chance the Rapper, into a retrospective on what it means to be the only black audience member at a Bruce Springsteen concert—which ends in a visit to Michael Brown’s grave. Abdurraqib’s mourning in this moment is brief and then put on hold, while he dives into an impassioned argument in defense of the pop genius of Carly Rae Jepsen. In his writing, there is no separation between art and life. Each informs and intertwines with the other. He is at his best in these accounts, suffused with nostalgia, of concerts and of performers. He sees music as a vessel through which things are felt and processed, both by the creator and the listener, and has deep respect for all art which he believes does this honestly.
“They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us” does not shy away from death, but rather sheds light on it. Abdurraqib writes, “There is pretty much no violence in this country that can be divorced from this country’s history.” His essays are eulogies for Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, the victims of the Charlestown shooting, and so many more black lives stolen too soon from this earth. He is achingly honest about his reactions to such devastation and the fear it has instilled in him. It is hard to pinpoint where, in the course of his youth, he loses his innocence. There is a moment, in a heartbreaking account of his first time being pulled over unreasonably and harassed by the police, in which he has a haunting epiphany: “There are two sides of a night that you can end up on: one where you get to see the sunrise again, and one where you do not.” For just a moment, everything stands still.
Separate from the darkness of oppression but still on trial in Abdurraquib’s book is the violence of art. He attacks white violence and its ties to punk rock music, saying, “It is a luxury to romanticize blood, especially your own. It is a luxury to be able to fetishize violence, especially the violence that you inflict upon others.” The violence of art is by no means excused when placed aside the greater violence of the country as a whole. Death comes in many forms, which is no secret to this author. He pushes back against the glorification of killing oneself in pursuit of great art.  He writes, “So many of us begin tortured and end tortured, with only brief bursts of life in between, and I’d rather have average art and survival than miracles that come at the cost of someone’s life.” It is a surprisingly rare opinion to have in a country that would sooner see its artists martyred at their peaks than experience their lives in full.
For all its beautiful grief, “They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us” does not leave you downtrodden. The book is a longing for joy and for hope as much as it is a processing of loss. There is joy in each careful portrait he paints of his idols. In an essay titled “The Night Prince Walked On Water,” he retells the musician Prince’s performance at the 2007 Super Bowl as though it is a myth and Prince is a god. It is a eulogy in a league all its own. He writes, “Dearly beloved, when the sky opens up, anywhere, I will think of how Prince made a storm bend to his will. How the rain never touches those who it knows were sent into it for a higher purpose.” For just a moment, it is just you and Abdurraqib in that stadium, soaked to the bone and belting “Purple Rain” with the artist himself. In another essay, he writes an ode to Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright.” To him it is less of a song and more of a “salve.” It heals. “I realized the magic of ‘Alright’ is the same magic that exists in the body language of the joyful black greeting…. Kendrick Lamar says ‘God got Us’ and the Us crawls out of the speaker and wraps its arms around the black people in the room,” he writes. It is the spark that saves social movements from fatigue–a reminder of the freedom and the joy that they are fighting to secure.
The morning after the Pulse shooting in Orlando, Abdurraqib does not want to leave his bed. He is, eventually, beckoned to the window by the sound of children riding bikes and laughing outside. He ends his book with the essay “Surviving With Small Joys,” to which he has carefully woven a path throughout each of its predecessors. “Joy,” he writes, “can be a weapon—that which carries us forward when we have been beaten back for days, or months, or years.” Sometimes, it is all we have left.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past year of ruminating in these pages, I’ve reflected very little on the sport that consumes most of my life during the fall semester. A curious decision, especially given the outsized influence that rugby has on my life here at Harvard.
Perhaps that is because it is difficult for me to articulate just why I would choose to do such a thing. As an Economics concentrator, I can assure you that there are no rational actors running around on that pitch, myself included. Rugby is not for the risk-averse. We gladly put our bodies on the line, sacrifice heaps of our time, and incur opportunity costs upon opportunity costs, for…what exactly?
Even though most of us won’t go on and compete professionally after college, we will probably spend more time on the practice field, in competition, and in the gym than in the classroom. We will make superhuman efforts to contort and twist our academic and extracurricular schedules to preserve that 4 to 7 p.m. practice window, dragging ourselves out of bed to make those early morning lifts in and out of season and wondering if we are missing out on everything Harvard might have to offer during all those hours we spend across the river.
We certainly don’t play for the recognition, as it’s not like the Harvard student body turns out en masse for our sports teams on any day other than The Game. The crowds are usually sparse, sometimes even for playoffs and championships, and mostly consist of parents, other athletes, or maybe close friends and roommates if we’re lucky. It’s a shame, really, because the athletic community has so much pride in competing for this school, and we wish the Harvard community at large would share in the pride and honor we have.
In light of these not-entirely-marginal costs and challenges, it’s worth considering what drives me and my teammates to be on that pitch day in and day out. If you ask us, we will tell you that we play because we love our sport. We play because we love our teammates. We play because we love our school. That’s quite a cheery take on the matter, isn’t it?
Realistically, it’s hard to love rugby as you trek across the river for the second time of the day, almost three months into the season. It’s hard to love your teammates when you’re all stressed over midterms and playoff preparation, and see basically only each other over the course of the season. It’s hard to love our school when some of our classmates subtly insinuate that we are less academically qualified than they are because we’re athletes.
If being on this team for the past three seasons has taught me anything, it is that love is far from the flowery, hippie, irrational, inexplicable “feeling” of attraction that our culture so often seems to imagine it is. If this were the kind of love my teammates and I had for our sport and each other, there would be no rugby team at Harvard.
Athletics is full of platitudes, such as the notion that “we’re playing the sport we love” or “we love our teammates,” and while these phrases certainly reflect a shared sense of purpose and community, I must rebel against their casual and commonplace use. The love that carries our team is one of intention, habit, and sacrifice. Make no mistake: to love someone (or something) is to make a choice to do so. It is not a feeling. Love is not something you “can’t help” but do.
St. Augustine wrote in his Confessions that “my weight is my love. Wherever I am carried, my love is carrying me.” Our daily habits, commitments, and practices are expressions of what we chose to love. It’s not a question of whether we will love something, but what we will love.
With this idea of what genuine love really looks like, I see what a profound act of love it is when your team continues to wake up for lift, put in hours on the practice field, and compete with ferocity and spirit even when midterm season arrives and doesn’t leave, when physical fatigue starts setting in, and when hours of sleep slip away from you.
It is this love that sustains and persists when superficialities like “overcoming adversity” and “becoming the best” don’t move us. It is this love that forgives flaws, imperfections, and mistakes, keeping no record of wrongs. It does not shy away from difficult conversations in fear, but reaches out to others in truth.
This love is why we play.

It’s a natural feeling to want to look at your admissions file, as students are entitled to do by virtue of the Family Educational Privacy and Rights Act. With each passing year, the College’s acceptance rate only gets lower, and the number of people applying only increases. For many of us—especially freshmen who are still trying to carve out a space for themselves on a campus that can be daunting to anyone—the need to understand “why me?” is understandable. The number of students wishing the view their files has only increased since the last time we felt compelled to speak about this issue. Then, the rate of requests was approximately 100 a month. Today, the Harvard Admissions Office receives over 200 requests per month by students asking to view their admissions file.
For one, the plethora of file requests may potentially lead the Admissions Office to cast a greater veil of secrecy over an already-secretive process. The “circles, stars and weird numbers” facing curious file-viewers may only become more arcane and more abstract. Ironically, students searching for answers only become more puzzled.
As we have previously stated, we do not object to students’ right to view their admissions file. But we stand firm in our belief that all these requests only serve to heighten an unhealthy and toxic atmosphere that can often surround Harvard admissions.
Administrative resources aside, we do not believe it is good practice for students to view their admissions file because undergraduates evolve so much during their time here. They quickly change, as everyone does, and soon become different individuals from whom once they were in their high school days. College—especially Harvard, with its infinite amount of opportunities to develop new interests, hobbies, and skills—changes people, for better or worse. Many of us choose to trade in our varsity letterman jackets for a lab coat or put down the high school newspaper for a laptop to start coding. Viewing our files might only serve to create a negative view of ourselves, forcing us to think we should do more or do less or change in some way. But no one is perfect—we need to understand this and learn to be happy on a campus that piles enough pressure on our plate.
We should learn to let go of the often-stressful college applications cycle and learn to appreciate where we are now. It’s our hope that our fellow students will learn to accept the present as well as the past. The fact that you are here speaks volumes. While we may all have our own unique traits, we have one thing in common: The Admissions Office trusted us enough to send an offer of admission.
In the end, that’s what matters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 28, 2015, with Commencement speaker and former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and University President Drew G. Faust looking on, 1612 Harvard College seniors received their degrees. Of the graduating class, 14 percent left the ceremony as the first college graduates in their family and 21 percent of students, or their families, left with debt from studying at Harvard. And 31.2 percent of female seniors left as sexual assault survivors.
Victims reported 27 rapes on campus to the Harvard University Police Department in 2016. Many more assaults are anonymously reported via mouse clicks. In a 2015 survey of just over half the students at Harvard, 172 women reported  “nonconsensual sexual contact” in the previous year. Harvard is afflicted with a sexual assault disease, and the stories of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore help us diagnose why. Men sexually assault and harass women, in part, because others allow them to do so.
As a male student at the Harvard Kennedy School, I have readily joined the chorus condemning Weinstein and Moore’s disgusting abuse of power. But concentrating criticism on these (rightly) vilified perpetrators reveals a problem with our approach to sexual assault. We are only focusing on some of the people who are responsible for sexual assault.  We are ignoring, for example, people like me.
Here’s an example to illustrate what I mean. During Orientation Week in August of 2016, I was out late drinking in Harvard Square with two classmates. The topic switched to the women in our class. Over the drunken hum of the bar’s collective conversation, one guy proposed the “hottest” girls in our class. The other did the same. They both then asked me to rank the girls in our cohort in the order I wanted to get with. My alarmed heart bolted blood to my cheeks. I crossed my arms, unable to speak. “Are we making you uncomfortable?” one asked me. I cannot remember my exact response. But it was not: “Yes. Objectifying women, even though it seems harmless to you, demeans them and creates an environment that makes sexual assault more likely.” Instead, I uncrossed my arms, I shook my head, and yes, I discussed which girls were hot.
At the time, it was easy for me to discard my act of cowardice as inconsequential. The desire to be included made the risk of speaking up too great. During many similar “inconsequential” comments at the pub and locker rooms throughout my life, I know I’ve taken the easy way out.
Have you done the same? Maybe sat back while peers made sexually explicit comments about women on spreadsheets, like the Harvard men’s cross-country team did? Or didn’t say something when a woman was described as “the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated” like the Harvard men’s soccer team?
My silence that night—and in other moments—meant I accepted those comments and therefore an environment of disrespecting women. The same environment in which 87 percent  of women aged 18 to 25 have experienced sexual harassment and half of all women are sexually harassed in American workplaces. My silence lies on a continuum of complicity—complicity that allows sexual assault to occur.
It strikes me that Weinstein and Moore were not alone in their assaults. Enablers shrunk from confronting these men. Weinstein’s staff put women at the monster’s mercy by organizing, or quickly leaving, meetings with female targets. Weinstein hired gangs of spies and lawyers to suppress crimes. The media and his peers only attacked Weinstein once his power began to fade. Although troubled by Moore’s pursuit of young girls, people in Gasden, Ala., did not forcefully intervene. A teenager was even summoned from trigonometry class to the principal’s office so Moore could ask her out.
I am not trying to remove responsibility from the men who attack women. Their behavior must change—but so should the behavior of people not directly involved in sexual assaults. Avoiding small confrontations over sexist comments and behaviors is what allows a rape culture, an environment where rape is prevalent—like at Harvard—to build. Had their enablers taken the harder, riskier option and spoken up, Weinstein and Moore might have been stopped. Had more people in the Harvard community spoken up to combat sexist comments and behaviors, the strength of rape culture on campus would have weakened and assaults might have been prevented.
Courageous assault survivors risk backlash or disbelief by reporting their experiences. The rest of us should also risk backlash to challenge sexist comments and behaviors.  We are all responsible for preventing sexual assaults on campus and in the wider community. To help us do so, the Harvard administration should survey and report on sexual assault annually, like they did in 2015.
There are about 800 first-year women on track to graduate in May 2021. If we permit an environment that sees 31.2 percent of them experience sexual assault, nearly 250 female seniors will graduate as sexual assault survivors. We are all responsible for ensuring that students in our community are conferred only degrees from Harvard—not trauma.

Five Harvard seniors and six University affiliates were named Schwarzman Scholars on December 4, according to the scholarship’s press office.
Crimson news editor C. Ramsey Fahs ’18, Charles S. Krumholz ’18, Jae Hyun Lee ’18, Cristina S. Parajon ’18, and Justus E. Uwayesu ’18 will join the 16 previous recipients from the University.
Harvard Business School alumnus Stephen A. Schwarzman established the scholarship in 2013. Its recipients attend a one-year master’s program at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and can choose to concentrate in Public Policy, Economics and Business, or International Studies.
In an interview with The Crimson last year, Schwarzman said he hopes scholars will gain a better understanding of China’s role in the 21st century.
“To not understand what's going on with the largest and increasingly powerful country in the world is really a shortfall,” he said. “The Schwarzman Scholars provides a unique way of learning about it.”
The selection process is open to students who are 18 to 29 years of age and have or will receive a bachelor’s degree before beginning the program. It requires that applicants travel to New York for an interview in addition to submitting three essays and four letters of recommendation. Krumholz said the application process “was probably the most extensive application process that I have ever been through.”
Scholars study a core curriculum including classes on comparative government, Chinese history, and economics in addition to studying Mandarin.
Parajon and Uwayesu, who are from Nicaragua and Rwanda respectively, both said that they want to bring knowledge about China back to their home countries.
“The role of China, as an economy that is growing fast and as a place that has a huge impact on the African economy, is very interesting to me,” Uwayesu said.
Parajon, who plans to study reproductive health in China, said she wants to use the degree to help young women in Nicaragua.
“I want to pursue work that makes Latin America a more empowering place for women,” she said. “ A lot of girls from my neighborhood didn’t get to pursue their dreams of becoming lawyers and doctors and sociologists, so I want to use my master's from Tsinghua to address those inequalities.”

Harvard Law School’s student government leaders signed a pledge to improve mental health at the school, joining student leadership from 12 other top law schools.
The letter criticizes the “damaging” popular culture stereotype about law school—that it must be a “grueling and overwhelming ordeal to adequately prepare students for legal practice.”
Student government president Adrian D. Perkins and vice president Amanda Lee wrote, along with the other signees, that each school plans to broaden their mental health outreach efforts through their own initiatives and in association with other campus student groups.
This pledge follows the Law School’s distribution of a survey last month meant to gauge the status of student mental health at the school. A similar survey conducted at Yale Law School in 2014 found that 70 percent of the 296 students in the sample group struggled with mental health at some point during their time in law school.
Prior to the release of the survey, Lee said it was necessary for Harvard to collect its own data about mental health.
“We wanted to have some baseline data for our community as well and Harvard’s quite different from a lot of schools because we’re just so large,” Lee said. “Having that information is really important for advocating for better services.”
The Law School’s Student Mental Health Association has also planned its own initiatives to address questions about the “character and fitness” questions on the Bar examination, the test necessary to practice law in the United States, that inquire about certain mental health diagnoses and sometimes lead students not to seek help.
In addition to Harvard, other signatories included student leadership at Columbia, Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale Law Schools.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said the College has not decided if the recently-affirmed undergraduate social life policy will appear in the student handbook, which is approved each May by the Faculty.
University President Drew G. Faust announced Tuesday that the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, had voted to maintain a policy that penalizes members of final clubs and Greek organizations.
Maintaining the sanctions was one of three options Faust faced for the future of undergraduate social life. The other two options were to institute a ban on membership in single-gender groups or choose from a set of other possible options.
The Faculty voted down a motion designed to counter the policy in November. In an interview in October, however, Smith said the Faculty may have another chance to vote on the policy: If it is introduced into the handbook, Faculty will have to approve it in May.
Smith said that now that Faust and the Corporation have reached their decision, the College is reviewing the handbook.
“Now that we’ve reached a point where we have some clarity on how to move forward, we will go and look at the handbook and decide what changes need to be made,” he said.
In an interview last week, Faust said she does not know whether or not the policy will go into the handbook, and that the Corporation does not get involved with the student handbook.
“I don’t think most people in the Corporation would have much knowledge of what’s even in the handbook, or the details of the handbook,” she said. “That’s something that will be very much in the hands of the Dean of the College and the Faculty to work out.”
In October, Smith said that any “major changes” to the University’s policy on unrecognized single gender social groups would likely be approved by the Faculty. But in the interview Friday, Smith said the policy could instead appear in a different location.
“I’m sure we’ll find ways to make sure that the students understand the policy,” Smith said. “Certain things are written in the handbook, other things are available to you as policy on one of our websites, available to you on other venues.”
Throughout months of debate on the sanctions, some faculty members charged that the policy—which was not approved by faculty beforehand—has infringed upon their right to shared governance of the University. With the Corporation’s unusual foray into undergraduate social life, some faculty members remain concerned that they are losing a say in University affairs. Smith said he does not see it that way.
“I don’t see it as unnatural that the Corporation was involved in this,” he said. “As I said earlier, I think that all of us have to be working together for this policy to work. The partnership with the students and the Faculty and the administration is going to be critical to the success of getting to the kind of community that we want on campus.”
Smith said he is not sure in what capacity the Faculty will be involved with the implementation of the policy. Faust announced Tuesday that the policy will be reviewed in five years; the review will be presented to the Faculty.
“I hope the community works together on trying to understand how to move forward with the policy that we now know that we’re going to be using for the next five years,” he said.

Harvard graduate students have continued to advocate against Republican tax proposals that could hike their taxes and cut into the University’s endowment, stepping up lobbying efforts as Congress prepares to finalize next year’s tax plan.
One of the Republican provisions—included in the U.S. House of Representatives’ bill —revokes the tax-exempt status of “qualified tuition reductions” that universities give to their employees and paid graduate students. A tax expert estimated that taxing Harvard’s tuition grants could cause up to half of graduate students’ $35,000 stipend to go to taxes.
The Senate and House have also proposed an excise tax on large university endowments, a proposal that would cost Harvard $43 million next year, according to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Both bills passed their respective chambers in recent weeks, and a conference committee will convene to reconcile differences between the proposals and develop a finalized tax plan as soon as this week.
As lawmakers debate the specifics of the legislation, graduate students have called and written to members of Congress involved in negotiating the finalized proposal, asking them to oppose provisions affecting graduate students. Last week, organizers from Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers held a week-long phone bank to call legislators.
“We don’t know what the final bill will end up looking like,” Niharika N. Singh, a public policy graduate student and union organizer, said. “What we’re doing now is targeting House reps and Senators who will be on the conference committee to communicate what it means to tax the endowment, to tax the tuition waivers.”
Singh said that even if the House’s provision taxing tuition reductions is struck from finalized bill, other parts of the proposals—such as the endowment tax—could still affect graduate students.
“We know what happened the last time the endowment did poorly. Grad workers received, effectively, a pay cut, while Harvard rents and cost of living, in general, was rising,” Singh said, referring to this year’s below-average stipend increase for graduate students. The size of Harvard’s endowment dropped by almost $2 billion in fiscal year 2016.
Other students, meanwhile, have reached out beyond Harvard to seek support for their cause.
Alana Van Dervort, a biomedical sciences graduate student, published an open letter on Medium in late November, asking lawmakers to oppose taxing tuition deductions. The letter, which has since gathered over two thousand signatures from graduate students and faculty across the country, will be sent to legislators on the conference committee, according to Van Dervort.
Van Dervort, who is also a medical school student at Case Western University, said the tax bill would be particularly harmful to joint degree students like herself.
“I would not be able to pursue any singular degree if my tuition weren’t waived, and I certainly can’t pursue both degrees, being assessed for both as though I make income on both tuitions,” Van Dervort said. “So it’s particularly challenging for people who want to cross disciplines, do interdisciplinary work, and pursue a dual degree path. I just don’t know where I would get the money.”
Graduate students expressed hope that their advocacy would influence lawmakers’ thinking on the tax proposals.
“At least for the House, it seemed like they hadn’t heard from people recently. Because normally, when you’re calling otherwise, they know exactly what’s happening, and they’re very quick,” said Singh on her phone calls to Congress. “I had a number of decent conversations with a couple of the staffers.”
These attempts to lobby Congress against the tax provisions follow University officials’ own efforts to reach out to legislators about the tax plan.  On her latest trip to Washington, D.C., University President Drew G. Faust urged members of Congress to vote against the plan. In recent weeks, she has spoken to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer '71, and alumni in Congress about the bill.
A vote on the finalized tax proposal is expected before the end of the month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 11, 2017 at 2:20 p.m.
Students expressed surprise and confusion at recently proposed changes to the advanced standing program, which currently allows undergraduates to graduate early or pursue a fourth-year master’s degree by granting Harvard course credits for high Advanced Placement test scores.
Last Tuesday, the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Education Policy submitted a set of recommendations to members of the faculty. The committee—which has reviewed this issue since 2013—recommended that the advanced standing program, which currently grants up to 32 Harvard credits to students who scored a five on at least four qualifying AP tests, should no longer accept those scores for Harvard credits.
These recommendations—if adopted—are expected to make it more difficult for students to pursue a master’s degree in senior year or to graduate in less than eight semesters. Those who pursue advanced standing under the proposed policy would need to satisfy the full 32-credit requirements, forcing students to take five or six courses per semester to graduate early.
The committee recommended, however, that the College continue to use Advanced Placement scores for placing students into higher-level courses and for fulfilling language requirements.
At last week's faculty meeting, many professors said they were concerned about the potential consequences of the proposal.
Mark A. Bode ’17 said that he graduated in six semesters to ease the financial burden on his family. Bode said that while he does not regret his decision, he understands the committee’s reasoning.
“I know that Harvard’s a wonderful place that is full of academic rigor and diversity,” he said. “I can see why foregoing one of those years would cause students to lose out and I can see why the college is doing it.”
Many students were not aware of the recommendations. Michael Zhang ’20, a joint concentrator in Statistics and Computer Science, said that he was unaware of the proposed changes until he was contacted by The Crimson.
“I think just that the College, if they choose to pursue different policies, should be very clear and very transparent so that every student is aware of these changes,” said Chang, who plans to pursue a master’s degree in either Physics or Applied Math. “It can potentially be very damaging to students in terms of trying to plan their curriculum.”
Yashvardhan M. Bardoloi ’21, a prospective Economics concentrator who is considering advanced standing, said that he was “surprised” by the recommendations.
“I just hope that they make the decision sooner or later because if they make that finalized decision this semester, then I would have time to readjust my plans and figure out what I want to do,” Bardoloi said. “If the decision was made during my sophomore year and it applies to me, then that would be quite troublesome.”
The recommendations could be put into place by vote as early as the next faculty meeting in February, though the FAS docket committee has not yet determined when the faculty will vote on the measure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago, the women’s track and field team was a very young team. In spite of that, the group captured the elusive Ivy League Triple Crown—a title denoting an Ancient Eight title in cross country and both indoor and outdoor track and field. It was the first time in program history and the second time in division history that the feat had been achieved. This year, the women’s track and field team is still a young team.
A sprinting squad that was dominated by freshmen and sophomores in 2017 is now managed by most of those same athletes, only with a year more of experience. At the helm of that group is junior sprinter Gabby Thomas. One of the newly elected captains, Thomas has been a menace in the Ivy League for the past two seasons.
At the 2017 indoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, the indoor first team All-American took three gold medals. In the proceeding outdoor Heptagonal Championships, Thomas won five gold medals, one for every single event she competed in. She was unsurprisingly the unanimous pick for the Most Outstanding Performer of the Ivy League Heps and later received first team All-American honors for the outdoor track season as well.
As a sophomore, the Florence, Mass., performed at the national stage for both seasons. At indoors she placed eighth in the nation for the indoor 200-meter dash, and third for the second year in a row in the outdoor variant.
Thomas doesn’t seem to be losing steam at all. In her first meet of the season on December 2, she broke the school record and the facility record for an event she didn’t even compete in at Heps, the 300-meter dash. The 37.47 finish earned the Florence Flash one of her two golds, with the second coming in the 60-meter dash.
Last season, a senior, Jade Miller, and two freshmen, Maya Miklos and Karina Joiner raced alongside Thomas in the gold medal outdoor 4x400-meter. The first years, now sophomores, return to the track with senior level experience, having won at the Ivy League’s largest stage.
And their experience shows. In last week’s Boston University meet, Miklos claimed gold in the 600-meter run and Joiner set a personal record in her 60-meter hurdle second place finish. The pair teamed up with classmate Micah Meekins and freshman Claire Hotchkin to then take bronze in the 4x400-meter relay. Though young, the sprinters for the women’s team are already in the front end of the competition.
A veteran herself, co-captain Marlena Sabatino is well placed to continue her role as the leader of the women in the field. In pole vault, the senior took third at indoors and fourth at outdoors during the 2017 season. Last week, she was second among college athletes. The co-captain’s performance will be supplemented this season by two sophomores, Simi Fajemisin and Zoe Hughes. Both from the U.K., the two specialize in jumps and the heptathlon, respectively. Fajemisin took first in the triple jump and second in long jump at outdoors last season while Hughes was the division champ in the heptathlon.
However, the field is not without holes. The departure of Nikki Okwelogu ‘17 is significant among the group. Throughout her four years donning Crimson, the graduate won every single indoor and outdoor Heps competition in the shot put event. It may just be freshman Emily Johns that fills this hole. Last weekend, the first year placed 12th in shot put, the highest of any Harvard affiliated thrower.
“The field event groups are definitely progressing nicely into the indoor season,” Johns said. “Moving forward, I hope to become more technically proficient in the throws. For the indoor season, I hope to qualify and potentially place at Heps.”
This isn’t the only wound to the women. The cross country team is nursing the loss of two of its top three runners from its Ivy League Champion squad. Senior and Ivy League champ, Courtney Smith transferred to Stanford while sophomore Judy Pendergast left for Oregon. Division champs last year, the women’s cross country team placed eighth in the fall rendition of the Heptagonal Championship meet.
However, two of the team’s returning members raced over the summer for their respective nations’ junior national teams over the summer. Sophomores Eliza Rego and Lisa Tertsch ran for the USA and Germany, respectively, and are likely to be consistent producers for the Crimson.
For the men, the hope is to return to Ivy League dominance. Placing fourth and sixth in the Ancient Eight divisional meets, the group brings back several key performers. Two of which are the newly elected captains.
Junior co-captain Myles Marshall swept the Ivy League last season in the 800-meter run, taking gold in both the indoor and outdoor divisional meets. Alongside him is co-captain Jay Hebert. Last season, the senior recorded the second-fastest time in program history in the 60-meter hurdles in addition to claiming silver in the event at indoors.
The team did well at the most recent meet as well, putting six of its members in the top 10 list for the 300-meter. Hebert won the 60-meter hurdles while sophomore Donagh Mahon grabbed third in high jump with a personal best and junior Ian West took second in pole value among collegiate athletes.
For both teams, the freshman class is a strong group. The 28 new faces have already made an impact on the cross country teams and in the group’s first meet. Freshman Abbe Goldstein was the top finisher for the Harvard women at the Cross Country Heps as Hugo Milner was the top finishing freshman overall in the men’s division at the meet.
At the Boston University meet last weekend, two freshmen—Jovahn Williamson in the 300-meter dash and Ryan Thrush in the 1000-meter run—claimed gold.
“From what I’ve seen, it looks like we have some very talented athletes in the freshman class, many of whom are capable of competing with the upperclassman,” Thrush said. “It should be a good season, everyone’s been working hard and we’re all excited to compete.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 16, freshman defensive back Ben Abercrombie suffered a major cervical injury in a football game at Rhode Island. He collided with a wide receiver, fell motionless to the ground, and was rushed to a nearby hospital.
Three months later, Abercrombie faces an enormous struggle. The Hoover, Ala., native cannot move his limbs or breath on his own. His family must find ways to pay an ever-growing list of bills—medical expenses, home renovations to create an accessible environment, and other costs.
El Jefe’s Taqueria has decided to help. On Tuesday, the Harvard Square shop will hold a fundraiser for Abercrombie and his family.
During the event—which will run from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m.—El Jefe’s will donate all revenue to The Benson M. Abercrombie ‘21 Fund, which will provide financial help to the Abercrombie family. Customers can pledge extra money by dropping cash in a helmet or signing an electronic kiosk at the end of an order.
“Given the circumstances, Ben and his family are in great spirits,” Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said. “But there is a long road ahead.”
The Harvard Varsity Club started the Abercrombie Fund on Oct. 4, roughly two weeks after Abercrombie’s injury. The account assists any Crimson player who “incurs a severe or catastrophic injury” during competition. Since then, the trust has gained over $220,000—some for Abercrombie to use and some for future student-athletes.
The fund supplements an NCAA-wide policy called the Catastrophic Injury Insurance Program, which covers medical expenses for injured athletes. However, the mechanism requires a $90,000 deductible and limits use of funds to narrow purposes.
For the past two months, Abercrombie has undergone a trying process of rehabilitation. On Oct. 12, he transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, which specializes in spinal cord injuries. The Abercrombie family has documented the journey through CaringBridge, a website that allows users to share medical updates.
Abercrombie has experienced slight improvements. He can eat non-hospital food—albeit slowly—and make trips outside the Shepherd Center. Last week, he received a switch device that enabled him to use his iPhone without help from others.
“Ben has started to interact more with his friends via text and social media,” wrote Ben’s father, Marty, in the most recent CaringBridge post. “He can no longer complain about Mom or Dad messing up his text messages!”
The next step for Abercrombie is a surgery to implant a diaphragm pacer. Ultimately, that device would allow the freshman to breath without a ventilator. Doctors have scheduled the surgery for this week.
Besides El Jefe’s, other establishments have held events for Abercrombie. Earlier this month, the Atlanta-based chain WingsZone offered five free wings to all customers and donated $1 for each giveaway. The promotion ran at 80 locations in the United States, including stores in Hoover and Tuscaloosa, Ala., that Ben’s father owns.
In addition, the tag #StandUpForBen has circulated on social media. On Dec. 3, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 took the cause national when he wore red cleats dedicated to Abercrombie. One side read “#StandUpForBen,” and the other read “Abercrombie.”
Several members of Harvard football, including head coach Tim Murphy, have visited the freshman. Senior safety Tanner Lee and freshman offensive lineman Josh Hall made the trip over Thanksgiving Break. A week before, teammates had named Lee the season MVP, earning the safety a commemorative watch. While at the Shepherd Center, Lee presented that prize to Abercrombie.
The El Jefe’s fundraiser comes as the most recent effort to support Abercrombie. Owner John Schall announced the initiative in a Nov. 29 email.
Schall has a history of supporting individuals after serious injures. Four decades ago, a car accident consigned his younger brother Mike to a wheelchair. And six years ago, Schall held an event for Brenna Bean, a high school senior who suffered partial paralysis after another crash.
That 2011 fundraiser raised tens of thousands of dollars. On Tuesday, patrons at El Jefe’s will have a chance to do the same.
“Ben is looking forward to a time when he and his family can be at their home instead of in the rehab center,” Scalise said. “Everybody realizes…there [are] a lot of uncertainties of what will happen.”
