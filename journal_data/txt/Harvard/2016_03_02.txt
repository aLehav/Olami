After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even students who find themselves sprinting down Quincy Street one minute before Harvard Time on the way to lab will notice the giant, concrete structure that whips by their peripheral vision. But to many, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts is little more than that—a funky-looking spectacle. In an effort to engage a wider audience, CCVA launched Consumer Research Center/bookshop, which sits atop the hulking spiral walkway.
The CRC/bookshop is the Carpenter Center’s first endeavor as part of its Consumer Research Center/ initiative, which explores the relationship between consumer products and contemporary culture. The store is a collaboration between the CCVA and Motto Books, an international distributor based in Switzerland. CRC/ will experiment with the space—across from the Sert Gallery, overlooking the terrace on Quincy Street—in order to both exercise and reflect on consumer practices in cultural contexts. Future plans for CRC/ include a farmer’s market, a design boutique, and a coffee bar.
Simply as a book retailer in and of itself, CRC/bookshop aims to be useful to the area. “Motto is a bookshop that fills a void in Cambridge and Boston, from my observations,” says James Voorhies, director of the Carpenter Center. “We’ll be able to introduce people to an amazing amount of cultural production in contemporary art and writing and film and architecture and design that we don’t have very good access to here.”
This shop will serve as Motto’s first semi-permanent outpost in the United States. Motto specializes in smaller and self-published titles, and the merchandise on display reflects its eccentric curation. In a short span, one shelf, features both “Sleep Cures Sleepiness” and “Mazdaznan Health & Breath Culture.” The zany quality of these titles is exactly what CRC/bookshop embodies and hopes to contribute. “They carry a lot of titles that we, for example, don’t have in the art museum,” says David R. Odo, director of student programs and research curator of university collections initiatives at the Harvard Art Museums. “It’s really terrific for those of us who are interested in contemporary art, and I think it’s a great opportunity for students to come in and see what’s happening.”
According to Voorhies, the value of CRC/bookshop for students is twofold. In addition to being a concentrated site of commerce, the store also aims to serve as a critical reflection on consumer practices. More specifically, CRC/ hopes to encourage a closer examination of the increasingly frequent 21th century practice of hybridizing economic and cultural activities. The mainstream concepts of bookshop/coffee bar, bookshop/film screening, and design studio/coffee bar are examples of this phenomenon that likely sound familiar. CRC/bookshop itself will be hosting a number of events, using books as a departure point for its programming. “It’s part of an approach by this institution to think about how to build audiences and how to respond to consumer habits today,” Voorhies says.
The bookshop brings up numerous questions about contemporary retail practices. “To what extent is it really just a bookshop, and to what extent is it a comment on consumer culture?” Odo says. The initiative hopes to spark meaningful reflection: How difficult is it to walk into a bookstore without interacting with anyone? What do customers take away from these interactions? How does the public have particular stake in the types of commerce that also blend with culture?
These questions are difficult to answer, but the CRC/ team hopes that a walk around CRC/bookshop will help jump-start some critical thinking. “It’s really wonderful to have the space activated again in this way,” Odo says. “Different voices, different kinds of insight—not just seeing the art itself but thinking about different kinds of critique—is great for the students to have access to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a pilot program last year that kept two dining halls open during spring break, a new plan is in the cards this year. According to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, the College plans to reshuffle its meal plan for undergraduates who choose to stay on campus this spring break, closing all House dining halls and giving students on high levels of financial aid cash stipends for their meals. The new system—which will allot $225 stipends for the nine-day break—contrasts with last year’s decision to keep two House dining halls operating normally. 
This proposal is a productive one. It marks a new solution to the challenge of feeding students who elect to stay on campus over break. The stipend system gives students greater flexibility than they had last spring break, for example, when only Currier House and Dunster House’s dining halls were open. This dining plan, however, does have its issues and raises larger questions about the term-time student dining system.
Primarily, the stipend is inadequate. $25 per day is not sufficient for three full meals, especially considering Harvard Square’s high prices. It is reasonable to suspect that many students will end up paying out of pocket to supplement these funds.
The stipend also broaches the larger question of whether Harvard’s mandatory undergraduate meal plan is the best system. Students are now required to pay for all 21 HUDS meals per week, despite the fact that hardly anyone eats three meals a day in a dining hall. Between missed breakfasts and meals dined out, it is rare that a student makes the most of each of these meals that they are required to pay for. More flexible options, such as a partial meal plan, thus present a potential solution.
The spring break stipend system, however, reflects the value in giving students flexibility in their dining options and perhaps opens up the issue to conversation. Khurana plans to hold events over spring break, such as gatherings with pizza to make sure that students do not feel like House life has diminished over the break. We feel that the same argument extends naturally to the rest of the year. Lowering the burden of the meal plan would not be a big blow to House life like many fear.
Ultimately, the spring break dining plan still remains a work in progress. Last year’s system of keeping two House dining halls open was a pilot program in itself. And with the coming break, the College will have the chance to assess the merits of a new system. In any case, it will most likely take several steps of trial-and-error to find the right balance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something incredibly off-putting about bald-faced claims that unapologetically attempt to make sense of our place in the world. Some of these statements, however, are emotionally resonant enough to deserve no protracted rebuttal. These are the kind of statements that we naturally recourse to in hard times—nice little cushions of affirmation, making the fall all the lighter, letting us feel all the better.
One such claim is that any individual is more than the quality and output of their production. We remind ourselves by reminding others that we are not our schoolwork, not our career prospects, not any variant of result-driven definers. We point towards something intrinsically embedded within ourselves, a self-worth that transcends the opinions of others. Our identity becomes grounded in the specialness of our existence, in the assortment of identity markers that make me me.
Nevertheless, the same mechanism underlies the search for our authentic self and the dogged pursuit of success: Namely, the need to define ourselves through specific, convenient methods that reassure us that we’re properly relating to the world. We turn to schoolwork, friendships, relationships, our interior life, even our faith—maybe in that order, maybe in another—falling from trapdoor through trapdoor, hoping to land in the compartment that best expresses who we are.
I have identified as an evangelical Christian since I was eight years old. I tagged along with my parents to a Baptist church, and I kept tagging along, even after I transitioned away from home and childhood. I believed that this faith would be my help in ever-present trouble—trouble keenly accentuated when I flailed and failed in every major aspect of life, not in some epic fashion, but in the small, frustrating ways common to all of us. Yet, the immovable, unconquerable parts of my soul—my self-confidence, my closest friendships, my introspection—eluded me just as stubbornly as everything else.
I know, of course, that I’m not really a terrible student, or a terrible friend, or really that bad of a person. I know, too, that I could keep splashing myself with a dose of so-called realism, accepting this so-called human condition, this feeling that there’ll always be something crawling under your skin, some deeper fabric of yourself that you’ll never fully understand.
And yet, I find it impossible to reconcile this mode of thinking, compelling me to accept the insufficiency of my existence as defined by what I do and who I am, with the reassurance than I am more than the things I do. Because, then, your preferred method of work—spiritually, scholarly, relationally, whichever one best expresses who you know yourself to be—becomes the only possible thing that can define you, the electrical rail-line that keeps you grounded and moving. You have no choice but to be the best self that you know, even when that self rings painfully hollow.
This is especially true of many people who ascribe to Christianity and other religious systems. There’s a certain comportment that believers are meant to embody, one in which faith imbues every action with life-affirming meaning. Too often, however, this becomes one more way to measure ourselves, a twisted test of how pious and devout and “deep” we can be. By these standards, I was, and remain, far from the grace of God.
But faith isn’t meant to lead you towards self-sufficiency. Rather, it’s meant to illuminate this very gap—between what you should be or want to be, and what your current circumstances say about you. Faith takes that introspection, that self-doubt, and casts it outwards, reminding you, in the process, that your worth is measured, not in how you want to define yourself, but in how God views you, as His creature and His child. Realizing that you’re a bad person might be hard; realizing that you’re more than that is infinitely harder.
It might seem like I’ve circled back to another sweeping generalization about living a good life—and a highly divisive one at that. You could choose to logically dismiss everything I’ve said, claiming that I’m projecting my experiences and insecurities onto a swath of people with different lives, different perspectives, different goals. And, in a sense, you would be right—because, if you’re looking for someone who can envision a world without an Almighty, someone who can answer your epistemological and cosmological questions, someone who has complete confidence in what he believes, who never struggles with doubt, who is certain that his belief is more than vestiges of beautiful childhood memories, I am not that person.
What I am is a hurt kid, unable to spar intellectually with arguments against the existence of God, impaired by depression and self-image issues, unaccomplished in the eyes of Harvard, sometimes a decent friend, more often than not a bad one, and all too willing to launch myself down spirals of self-loathing in order to get someone to pay attention to me.
But, despite this knowledge of myself, of these elements that make me me, I know, as hard as it may be to believe, that the love God has for me renders me more than the sum of my parts.  And if you know, maybe irrationally, maybe emotionally, that you have to be more than what you produce, then I hope that you’ll see that this is more than another controversial proclamation of faith, more than another way to a better me, more than another coping mechanism for loneliness and meaninglessness.
Friendships matter. Schoolwork matters. The things we want to accomplish—the families we’ll raise, the careers we’ll pursue, the people we’ll help—matter too. But, regardless of whether my life goes according to plan or ends up in shambles, the final result will never define my worth as a person. If I am more than my circumstances, my grades, my emotional status, my interior life, my relationships, then I am more than the best self I could possibly imagine, more than the places I’ll go, more than my wildest dreams and aspirations.
This doesn’t make the daily grind any easier. But I can rest sure in knowing that, although a good life may be hard to find, my own frenzied attempts at doing so won’t come to define me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the South Carolina Freedom Summit, Florida Senator and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio argued that “our strategy on global jihadists and terrorists, [should resemble] the movie 'Taken.' Liam Neeson… had a line, and this is what our strategy should be: ‘We will look for you, we will find you, and we will kill you.’” Although the Senator was hopefully attempting to showcase his comical side, his statement embodies the irresponsible trivialization of foreign affairs that dominates political conversations today.
Unfortunately, such imprudent thinking equally plagues both political parties. During an interview regarding America’s strategy to defeat ISIS, Secretary of State John Kerry was asked, “As a practical matter, how does introducing more weapons to the region help stabilize it?” Secretary Kerry’s response? “We’ll, they are defensive weapons.”
However, foolish statements made by public officials aren’t what drive me to smash my head against my desk in frustration. Policymakers are little more than salespeople these days; they’ve got to compress complex policy plans into short, memorable statements. In other words, policymakers have an excuse for their folly. Harvard students, on the other hand, do not.
Harvard students have an interesting relationship with American foreign policy. For those undergraduates who come from wealth, their money insulates them from the consequences of American blunders abroad. Meanwhile, for many other students, the question of whether the United States will intervene militarily in a foreign crisis presents more of a whimsical dinner conversation than a matter of life and death. When a particular candidate or political group makes an outrageous or blatantly ignorant statement, these students laugh. How could they not? To them, the hooligans making a mockery of our country’s foreign policy are nothing more than fools who provide the occasional evening entertainment.
But when policymakers push half-baked ideas to enforce abroad, I’m left terrified beyond belief. The lives of my friends rest in the hands of those who handle international affairs like some sort of game. When politicians talk tough to defend their honor, they risk committing our country’s young to yet again fight in poorly planned campaigns overseas.
To make matters worse, the blame for American disasters abroad often falls on those in uniform, whilst those in Washington escape with impunity. According to our Army’s own website, the “Army’s mission is to fight and win our Nation’s wars,” not decide what wars to fight to begin with. Soldiers serve a government that is elected by the people; thus, it falls on the common citizens to elect officials that will shed American blood wisely.
Nevertheless, who terrifies me most are not those in office but the very students who surround me. Before coming to Harvard, I found myself confused by the string of poor decisions made by policymakers, many of whom have attended prestigious universities. Donald Rumsfeld graduated from Princeton, Paul Bremer (the leader of the disastrous Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq) graduated from both Yale and Harvard Business School, and Porter Goss (Head of the CIA from 2004-2006) graduated from Yale. How could such educated policymakers ultimately spearhead some of the worst geopolitical disasters in modern American history?
Over the past year and a half, Harvard has shown me the answer. The constant pressure to seem all-knowing discourages students from admitting ignorance. When asked about foreign policy conundrums, students defer to oversimplified, partisan answers rather than admit a lack of knowledge. Syrian Civil War? The solution’s somehow a mixture of bombing ISIS and accepting refugees. Russian aggression in Eastern Europe? Simply maintain sanctions. When our peers become tomorrow’s policymakers, it’s vague answers like these that’ll get people killed.
If the Kurds of Rojava refuse to return the land they’ve purchased with their blood to Assad, what should we do? If al-Nusra or Russia sabotages the upcoming Syrian ceasefire, should the international community turn a blind eye? Is there any legitimate manner in which we can force Assad to peacefully assimilate opposition fighters, or will an Assad victory be followed by years of purges and persecutions? If we let the war drag on for another five years, will there even be a home for Syria’s refugees to return to, or should we consider permanently integrating them into other countries?
I don’t know the answer to these questions, but I know what’s at stake, and it’s certainly more than any individual’s political career. The aforementioned statements from Rubio and Kerry are neither funny nor useful; if anything, they’re downright dangerous. Students preparing to enter the realm of foreign affairs shouldn’t sacrifice complex, thoughtful responses in the name of strengthening their image. If we let pride trump truth, then tomorrow’s foreign policy failures lie just around the corner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I didn’t vote on Super Tuesday. It wasn’t out of laziness, apathy, or protest, but simply first-time voter inexperience. Yet while voters from twelve states flocked (or rather, trickled) to the polls for the Super Tuesday primaries, thousands are disenfranchised every time they try to vote by anti-democratic efforts aimed at excluding them from our political process.
I’d always thought voter registration was only a problem for underprivileged districts, suppressed by whatever local establishment had the most to gain by minimizing turnout. I, on the other hand, had it made: I would be voting in Cambridge, raised on 19 years of NPR or BBC, and fresh from a summer internship in the Senate. I’d watched every Presidential debate and my most-played iTunes clip was a dubstep remix of Trump saying “China.” How could I possibly mess this up?
And yet at the polling station in the Quincy courtyard 15 minutes before class on Super Tuesday, what was supposed to be my first vote as an adult American became a lesson in personal ineptitude and the ridiculously baroque nature of our system.
After one of the women who had taken a day off work to volunteer at the polls couldn’t find my name on a list of about twenty registered students from Leverett (why so few?!), she asked for my ID—a Massachusetts driver’s license—and went to “phone the election.” She returned a moment later: “You’re registered at your home address. You can’t vote here.”
I asked if I could do a same-day switch. Not possible. Get an absentee ballot? Too late. She gave me a form to change districts in time for the general. I briefly considered catching the 6:15pm ferry to Martha’s Vineyard before the polls closed at 8pm.
“You knew this,” said my Mum on the phone as I rushed to class. But I didn’t. Somehow, a short lifetime of political engagement had left me with the assumption that absentee ballots were only for people from outside the state. And when I checked the online registration system I’d used a few weeks earlier, nowhere on the application or confirmation had it instructed me.
I expect that much of my confusion—beyond what can be attributed to mere stupidity—arose from my Australian childhood. Australia has mandatory voting and Election Day is always on a weekend or national holiday, so that most people don’t have to take time off work to participate in democracy. I remember a Saturday on a beach just north of Sydney when Mum dragged herself off her towel to vote at a booth on the edge of the sand, surrounded by citizens emerging fresh from the surf to fulfill a civic duty. It would have been harder to find a bathroom than a polling place: even the habitually tuned out tune in, for a few moments. And they get counted. As a result, participation in Australian elections tops 95 percent. In the United States, only half of eligible voters make it to the polls.
In many American districts, voting isn’t made difficult so much by personal error as by intentional obfuscation, often stemming from racial bias. American voting has a long and painful history that began before Jim Crow laws that weren’t struck down until 1965 and continues today with voter suppression tactics that disenfranchise swathes of the population for political gain.
These tactics take many forms. Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Kansas for illegally requiring tens of thousands of citizens to provide additional documentation of citizenship when registering to vote. Similar cases have been brought in Georgia and Alabama, the source of the 2013 Supreme Court decision that eliminated many of the hard-won protections of the Voting Rights Act. These efforts, often in response to virtually nonexistent voter fraud, disproportionately target minorities and contribute to socioeconomic inequality. While there are many potential threats to democracy from big money in politics to NSA surveillance, flaws in voter registration and difficulty getting to a polling place on a workday are the most direct way in which our country fails to live up to its egalitarian principles.
Am I a fool for not knowing that I needed an absentee ballot? Yes. Is my situation better than millions of Americans whose votes are intentionally prevented? Of course. But should voting ever be any more difficult than absolutely necessary for any American? No. Perhaps even more important than Citizens United or iPhone privacy is a system that makes voting as easy as possible for as many people as possible, regardless of race or district. In the meantime, I’ll be changing my address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 2, 2016, at 7:58 p.m.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted Tuesday to approve a new General Education program that would allow students to take as many as half of the program’s requirements pass-fail.
The newly approved legislation mandates that students take four courses in new Gen Ed categories and three distribution requirements across FAS and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Additionally, the program requires a “quantitative facility” course, modified from the current Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning Gen Ed category.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris clarified at the meeting that, in theory, students could opt to take one of the Gen Ed courses as well as all three distribution requirements pass-fail. Though allowing students to enroll in a class pass-fail will remain subject to the discretion of the course instructor, many faculty expressed surprise at the change and said they were concerned this option could reduce the program’s rigor.
“I don’t really want students in my class who are both pass-fail and letter grade unless the pass-fail are not doing it for Gen Ed credit,” said Comparative Study of Religion professor Diana L. Eck, who called the change “appalling.” “It doesn’t make any sense to me, it feels like a weakening of this requirement and puts instructors in a strange position.”
In addition to the pass-fail option, the new Gen Ed category previously entitled “Aesthetics, Culture, and Interpretation” is now named “Aesthetics and Culture.”
“This is a historic moment,” University President Drew G. Faust said, congratulating the review committee on its work.
At the first faculty meeting last fall, Faust offered her own set of principles that she hoped would shape the new program to “embody the very best pedagogy.”  She said undergraduates should receive a liberal, interdisciplinary education that emphasizes elective opportunities and literacy in writing and mathematics.
Additionally, the Gen Ed legislation now states that a committee tasked with reviewing undergraduate education requirements will “recommend”—not “determine”—any changes to the program. The full Faculty still must vote on changes to graduation requirements.
It remains unclear when the new program will roll out, though FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has said he does not want to run two programs at once and on Tuesday emphasized that he would like the new program implemented as soon as possible.
Faculty also expressed concern about whether the new program—which passed without an delineated budget—would receive sufficient financial and administrative support.
History professor Andrew D. Gordon, in particular, said he worried that an inadequate plan for resources would impede the new Gen Ed, citing the financial crisis that complicated the launch of the current program in 2008.
Gen Ed committee chair Edward J. Hall added that teaching a successful Gen Ed course requires substantial preparation on the part of the course instructor, and suggested that a significant amount of resources would be needed for the new program to succeed. He said he expects around 120 to 150 Gen Ed courses to be offered each year.
“I couldn’t agree more that we have to put resources into this, but I also can’t create resources from nothing,” Smith said in response. “There’s unfortunately not a pot of money out there just waiting to be spent on Gen Ed.” Smith said he hoped to receive the support of faculty to prioritize funding for Gen Ed over other programs, where appropriate.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Faculty also voted to approve a dual degree program between the Music Department and the Berklee College of Music.
The program, which Faculty discussed at their meeting in January, mirrors the partnership already in place between Harvard and the New England Conservatory. Students enrolled in the Harvard-Berklee program will receive a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard and a Master of Music from Berklee in fields including music technology, digital production, global music, and jazz performance.
At last month’s FAS meeting, some professors raised concerns about the program, citing financial costs associated with niche academic opportunities that could preclude underprivileged students from participating.
The Harvard-Berklee program would cost each student $8,000 per year, the same cost of the current Harvard-NEC program, Music Department Chair Carol J. Oja said.
The Harvard-Berklee program’s global jazz track, however, would be fully funded, whether the enrolled student is at Harvard or another school, Oja added.
Psychology Professor Jason P. Mitchell, who previously has criticized the $8,000 annual tuition, said while he appreciates that the dual degree broadens the Music Department’s offerings, he worries that conversations about fundraising will cease after the program’s inception.
Smith said he would not prioritize funding financial aid for the program.
“Fundraising for Berklee is not high on my agenda,” Smith said. “I will fundraise more broadly for things in the arts than specifically for a program.”
Visual and Environmental Studies professor Robb Moss and Germanic Languages and Literatures professor Eric Rentschler introduced a proposal to transfer a current doctoral program in Film and Visual Studies from the purview of a standing committee to the VES department.
Faculty will vote on this proposed change at a future meeting.

Debate over a $4.5 million proposed renovation to Harvard Square’s Out of Town News Kiosk and surrounding plaza divided The Cambridge City Council members at the body's weekly meeting on Monday evening.
Councillors had intended to pass a resolution ordering the creation of a task force for “developing a framework for the continued stewardship, curatorship and oversight of the historic Kiosk.” The City has promised $4.5 million over the course of the next three years to fund the project. Following internal debates over the allocation of such funds and the level of public input, the Council pushed the resolution to the next meeting.
“The truth is, there isn’t enough information here,” Councillor Dennis J. Carlone said at Monday’s meeting. “How does the public get involved? It sounds like it’s already a done deal.”
Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said he also felt the project was in need of further discussion and suggested to place the resolution, sponsored by Mayor Denise E. Simmons and three other councillors, in the hands of a committee.
“This is, as far as I’m concerned, a critical use of funds, a critical convening point, and while I don’t have a particular agenda or urban planning background, I think the extra attention we could bring it might in fact tighten it up a little bit and send it on it’s way,” Mazen said.
The Out of Town News Kiosk, a building on the National Register of Historic Places, moved to its current location in the 1980’s. As the kiosk struggled to thrive with the advent of online news, it’s lease from Hudson News was dropped in 2008. The building is currently owned by the City of Cambridge.
The resolution would have also called for a partnership between the Harvard Square Business Association and the city government to “continue efforts to support and promote commerce in Harvard Square.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the association believes the kiosk is an important historical site for Cambridge and deserves the much needed funds for restoration.
The kiosk “hasn’t been really worked on since the 80’s. It’s registered on the National Historic Register. So the time has come for money to be invested in the building to protect it, preserve it, and maintain it properly,” Jillson said.
Because of the presence of underground tunnels and the busy atmosphere in the Square, the cost of renovation is likely to be hefty, according to Jillson. She added that the history of the building and plaza and the traffic of “10 to 12 million people a year” will ultimately justify the $4.5 million cost.
In 2015, the Cambridge Community Planning Department held a public meeting to discuss the future of the kiosk and plaza. Following the meeting, the Harvard Business Association funded an initial study of the renovation according to Councillor David P. Maher, a sponsor of the resolution.
“This should not just be a city responsibility,” Maher said. “And I think the Association is saying they would like to play a key role in this along with the city and conceivably, the universities which have much deeper pockets than the city or the Business Association.”

More than 100 students of different genders, sexualities and beliefs “came out” as feminists at the seventh annual Feminist Coming Out Day on Tuesday at the Barker Center Cafe.

Organized by the Radcliffe Union of Students and co-sponsored by the Harvard College Women’s Cabinet, the event brought students together to discuss what “feminism” means to them.
“Our event is intended for all who are interested in feminism, regardless of where they stand on this issue,” said Juhwan Seo ’17, Co-President of the Radcliffe Union of Students. “We always welcome not just the staunch feminists but also those who are questioning or against feminism to create conversations among students.”
Attendee Amy G. Zhao ’18 said she came to the event to express her support for feminism.
“I’m a feminist because I believe in equality for everyone,” Zhao said. “I think that some people are a little scared to say that they are a feminist, but it really is that, if you believe in equality you are a feminist.”
Peter L. Ku ’16, who also attended the event, said that for him, the event was “about getting people from different backgrounds to be a part of the conversation to learn from each other to build empathy and create better opportunities for everyone.”
Julie E. Estrada ’18, Co-President of the Radcliffe Union of Students, said organizers used the term “coming out” to support feminists in communities who may not have the same opportunities to talk about feminist issues.
“In many places throughout the world, ‘coming out’ can be subversive and a sometimes dangerous act,” Estrada said. “We wanted to continue the tradition here to bring strength to these communities.”
Leszek R. Krol ’18, who is on the board of the Radcliffe Union of Students, said he hoped that the event would dispel the negative connotations sometimes associated with the term feminism.
“I find that there is a lot of controversy even in the use of the term feminism, given that it just stands for equality of the sexes,” Krol said. “[The event] is an active way to affirm your belief in gender equality and try and make others understand what feminism is about.”
The event catered free drinks and vagina-themed cupcakes, and sold “This Is What A Feminist Looks Like” tank tops. Proceeds went to the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.
This year, the event also included a collection of archival images of feminist movements, courtesy of the Schlesinger Library.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences announced it would provide a 50 percent discount off T passes in January and double the stipend and leave time for adoptive and expectant parents in February, two different groups celebrated victories: the GSAS administration, and the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers.
Members of the unionization movement see a direct link between their efforts and the new changes coming out of GSAS. Following the increase in parental leave time and stipends, the HGSU-UAW posted on its Facebook page, “When we organize, we win! Once again, we see what grads at Harvard can accomplish when we act together.”
GSAS Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana, meanwhile, stated that the improvements resulted from a reassessment of the program and from engaging collaboratively with graduate students.
At an event that brought together graduate student organizers from several universities, Aaron T. Bekemeyer, a member of Harvard’s unionization effort, mentioned the new benefits in his speech.
“We didn’t see these things happening until January. We started our campaign in the fall,” Bekemeyer said. “When we organize and when we act collectively, it matters. It makes a difference. We’re seeing concrete changes as a result of what we’re doing already.”
GSAS Dean for Administration and Finance Allen Aloise pointed to the administration’s track record of providing benefits without the work of unions.
“Benefits for graduate students have been increasing and improving for more than a decade, and we are working hard with graduate students to ensure that trend continues,” Aloise wrote in an email.
The administration has responded to student groups advocating for change in the past. In 2013, the Graduate Student Council and the Student Health Planning Committee successfully pushed for increased mental health visits covered by student health insurance—from 12 visits to 24.
Julia M. Rogers, a board member of the Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering, said the group actively advocated for a parental support program back in 2008, when it joined with the Graduate Student Council and the GSAS Student-Parents Organization to survey graduate student parents on their concerns. That information was taken to GSAS administration.
“There was some progress towards working a solution at that point, but then with the economy crashing and everything, things started going on the back burner,” Rogers said. “And then we picked everything back up again in 2012.”
The GSAS administration created the Parental Accommodation and Financial Support program in 2013. Rogers said the group had not been actively advocating for an improvement to the program leading up to this year, when GSAS announced it would double the stipend and leave time.
McCavana did not specify if he worked with any specific student groups this time around, leading to speculation that the unionization effort placed the ball in the administration’s court to improve benefits.
“I know they say it has nothing to do with the union, but people pushed and pushed and pushed for parental leave for years and years and they finally got a little concession, and then we show up and within months they double it,” Avery A. Davis, a graduate student and supporter of the unionization effort, said. “I am a scientist so I can’t say that’s causation, but it’s a pretty odd coincidence.”
Rogers said the women in science group has maintained an open and effective communication channel with GSAS administration.
“They’ve been willing to talk to us about every issue that we thought was important to discuss,” Rogers said. “Clearly there are still things that I think Harvard needs to work on, but I’ve never tried to discuss something and not been able to.”
GSAS administrators still maintain that the relationship between graduate students and faculty should remain academic in nature. To that end, the University jointly filed an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board on Monday arguing against the unionization of graduate students.

Professors of the Divinity School’s new edX Scriptures course shared an array of teaching strategies and resources from each of the six course modules at an introductory panel in Andover Hall on Tuesday.
The course, titled “World Religions Through Their Scriptures,” has already attracted 22,000 registered participants as of its official launch on Tuesday, according to Diane L. Moore, the faculty leader of the course and director of the Divinity School’s Religious Literacy Project.
Designed to improve public religious literacy and deconstruct misconceptions about different faiths, the course will cover each of the five major world religions over the course of the next six months: Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism.
The panel event functioned as a preview of the interdisciplinary online course, which will incorporate lectures, social media, and multimedia activities to help participants absorb the material. The course will also use discussion and multimedia forums to foster student interaction, as participants have already been directed to introduce themselves on the course’s Twitter feed.
“We are not trying to give a comprehensive introduction to five of the world’s religious traditions,” Moore said. “What we are trying to do is give people language and tools to think about religion in some new and creative and constructive ways through illustration.”
Professors emphasized the role of experiential engagement with scripture using multiple forms of media in their course modules, rather than exclusively studying the written scriptures themselves.
Neelima Shukla-Bhatt, an associate professor of South Asian Studies at Wellesley College who will be teaching the Hinduism module of the course, said many Hindu texts were passed on through oral traditions for thousands of years before they were written down in textual form.
“Performance is the primary mode of transmission,” Shukla-Bhatt said. “I hope that at the end of my session, the students will ask what makes a text scripture? Where does the authority of the scripture lie? Is it in performance, or is it in the text itself?”
To illustrate the aesthetic and experiential aspects of Islam and Muhammad’s teachings in particular, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Ali S. Asani ’77 played a video of a concert recitation of the Quran for the audience.
“We are really engaging with the artistic dimensions: the sonic, the visual, and the literary,” Asani said.
John A. Sibley, a resident fellow at the Divinity School, said he thinks the course has a lot of ground as it covers each religion for only one month, and that course participants will need to show commitment.

Student leaders expressed surprise regarding recent changes to the new General Education program, approved by a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Tuesday, though they were quick to voice support for the alterations.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris released a final report in January outlining the new Gen Ed, designed to fix issues with the current program that has been deemed “failing on a variety of fronts.” Not included in that report, however, were changes, approved Tuesday, that will allow students to take up to four of their requirements pass-fail.
“I don’t think it’s ever a positive thing to have last-minute changes to programs that affect thousands of students,” said Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, a member of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee. “That’s never anyone’s first choice.”
Though UC Education Committee chair Scott Ely ’18 said he was “taken aback” by the late changes, he also said that he ultimately supported the move to give students the opportunity to take Gen Ed classes pass-fail.
“On the whole, I think it’s great for student choice,” Ely said. “It shows that Dean Harris and Dean [of FAS Michael D.] Smith and some of the other people involved are definitely committed to making sure that students have the opportunity to take new interesting courses and put themselves out there.”
Other UC members also expressed support for the pass-fail alteration, although with some initial reservations.
“This seems right off the bat to have both advantages and disadvantages,” Gonzalez said, referring to the new policy. “It works out great because [students] have more freedom to explore the class. On the other hand, you run the risk of students’ finding the easiest class they can and then making it easier on themselves by making it pass-fail.”
Several students not on the UC also said they worried that the new policy might detract from the academic rigor of the Gen Ed program. For freshmen especially, who remain uncertain about how the new Gen Ed will apply to them, the question seemed significant.
For Gopal K. Vashishtha ’19, who cited the experience of a friend at Brown, a school that is flexible on grading policies, the possibility of taking Gen Ed classes not for a letter grade might detract from the time and effort future students dedicate to classes.
“When you take a class pass-fail, whether intentionally or not, you end up devoting less time and energy to it,”  Vashishtha said. “If the point of Gen Ed is for you to engage deeply with a subject that’s not your primary area of study, I could see that allowing us to take Gen Eds pass-fail could be counter-productive.”
Other students, however, were more optimistic about the policy, saying that the new pass-fail option could let students explore different topics without fear of poor grades.
“By giving students more leeway with the Gen Eds, they’re more likely to choose their classes on their interests and be more open to exploring and embodying the liberal arts education,” Cindy Chau ’19 said. “They wouldn’t mind taking a really abstract class, and who knows what they might learn in that class.”

As voters across the country casted their ballots during the Super Tuesday primaries, dozens of Harvard Club of Boston employees rallied at a Donald J. Trump themed event to raise grievances with the Club’s administration.
Organized by UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents the Harvard Club workers, organizers rally outside of the Business School’s Burden Hall where Harvard University President Drew G. Faust was speaking for a fundraising event. Workers donned masks in the likeness of Donald J. Trump and jokingly chanted “What do we want? Exploitation. When do we want it? Now.”
This rally comes in the midst of a strained negotiation process between the union and the Club administration. Last December, over 300 undergraduates along with workers from the Club submitted a petition to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 requesting that the University revoke the Club’s name rights. The Club is not officially affiliated with the University.
Organizers of the rally said they were inspired by the growing media presence of the controversial presidential candidate.
Lila Goldstein, a union organizer, said that workers believe the Club is “acting like Donald Trump in terms of taking away rights for immigrant workers.” Laura Moye, one of the workers who imitated Trump, said she prepared for the role by thinking about “how mean” she could be.
“We have a lot of immigrant workers. Those benefits are very important for us, and they want to cut them,”  said Susan B. Cahrera, an employee at the Club.
Diana C. Pisciotta, the spokesperson for the Club, wrote in an emailed statement that the Club was “disappointed that Union organizers are focusing energies on false comparisons instead of coming to the negotiating table.”
Central to the workers’ concerns is the issue of healthcare—an often contentious topic that has previously caused rifts between campus unions and the University. Last week, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical workers voted to ratify an agreement reached with Harvard this past January, concluding a negotiation process that was stalled by debates surrounding healthcare benefits.
Additionally, contract negotiations for Harvard University Dining Services, another group represented by Local 26, are set to begin in June. At an event last week, HUDS members voiced concerns over a previous non-union health care package that some believed would be offered.
Pisciotta wrote that the Club has "taken every step possible during this current contract negotiation to put a fair offer on the table," including offering lower healthcare premiums and a new 401k plan.
Noah R. Wagner ’18, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate organization focused on labor issues, said the organization supports the Club workers.
“We have unique sway as members of the Harvard community who are really visible and who are supposed to become future members of the Harvard Club of Boston,” Wagner said. “And we want to make it known that those institutions need to become much more accountable and treat their workers much more fairly if they want to see the next generation of students join an institution like the Harvard Club.
Earlier this semester, some SLAM members attempted to attend a negotiation session between the workers and administrators of the Club. Their presence prompted Club administrators to end the meeting.
“It is our protocol that negotiating sessions can include members of the union leadership and employee representatives,” Pisciotta wrote. “To have students there, particularly those who are not informed on the facts, is a distraction from the real issues.”
Negotiations are set to continue, though it is unclear when both parties will agree on a new contract.  Prisciotta wrote that she is worried that the process will be prolonged.
“The Harvard Club remains committed to a fair resolution for our employees,” Prisciotta wrote. “But we are beginning to wonder if such a thing is possible with this negotiating team.”

Amid increasing concern over player safety and concussion prevention, Ivy League football coaches voted last week to eliminate all full-contact practices during the season.
While support to completely eliminate contact practices during the season was unanimous among coaches according to the New York Times, the potential rule change is still only in the “discussion” phase, according to Ivy League Associate Communications Director Scottie Rogers.
Rogers wrote in an email that the process to formalize any changes would take months and would have to go through multiple rounds of voting.
“From that discussion it gets developed into a proposal, and that proposal is what would get approved,” Rogers wrote. “The coaches approved to move forward with a proposal. That's where this stands.”
The Ivy League could formalize a no contact policy in June 2016 and go into effect as early as the 2016 football season, Rogers wrote.
Outlining how a potential no tackling proposal would move forward, Rogers wrote, “The decision tree for most major proposals/decisions that affects athletics in the Ivy League begins with the athletics directors first and then the policy committee and then finally to the presidents.”
The Ivy League currently enforces safety policies that are stricter than NCAA rules and requires teams to hold fewer full contact practices during preseason and the spring.
According to Ivy League football rules, teams are currently allowed just two full contact practice days per week while in season. “NCAA regulations currently do not address inseason, full-contact practices”, according to the organization’s website.
The move to formalize stricter rules would mirror current policies at Dartmouth, which barred in-season tackle practices in 2010.
The Faculty Council, the highest elected body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—under whose purview the Athletics Department falls—discussed concussions among athletes at a meeting in January.

University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides said the Title IX office has “fallen short” when it comes to transparency over Harvard’s sexual conduct policies, which some students said were unclear at a town hall Tuesday evening.

In her presentation on Harvard’s recently revamped sexual assault policy, Karvonides highlighted Harvard’s standards on “unwelcome conduct”—central to the policy's definition of sexual harassment—through hypothetical case studies. Specifically, she said welcomeness cannot be assumed between partners in the absence of a “no,” or through clothing, gender, race, or sexual orientation.
During a period for student questions about unwelcome conduct standards, some undergraduates argued that the policies are inaccessible and poorly publicized. Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, who attended the panel hosted by the Undergraduate Council, said the concept of unwelcome conduct is likely unclear to a majority of undergraduates.
Responding to Goldberg, Karvonides said the Title IX office has “fallen short” with regards to being clear and public about the University’s policies with its students.
In recently released results from Harvard’s sexual conduct climate survey, a majority of Harvard student respondents—71 percent—said they were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct.
The results also showed just 15 percent of surveyed students said they were very or extremely knowledgeable about how sexual assault and misconduct are defined at Harvard; 21 percent said they were not at all knowledgeable.
“Unfortunately our folks were not out enough, and we were not able to do enough messaging,” Karvonides said. Karvonides added that her office has recently released brochures on unwelcome conduct standards to better publicize the relatively new policies.
The Title IX Office previously released a set of Frequently Asked Questions last October in an effort to clarify its policies, but student activists criticized them for being “totally inaccessible.”
The town hall comes amid fervent discussions at Harvard about the rate of campus sexual assault and the response from University personnel.
In the past, students have criticized Harvard administrators, arguing that poor handling of reported sexual assaults have caused trauma among victims. Laila M. Smith ’17, who also attended the event, said that while raising awareness for the policies was needed, it wasn’t enough.
“We need to be aware of the policy because nobody knows what this is or how this process works, but we also need a huge effort of survivor advocacy and survivors spaces,” Smith said. “What the Title IX office is thinking about is the entire situation and what survivors are crying out for is someone to validate them on an institutional level.”
Just last week, recent graduate Alyssa R. Leader ’15 filed a lawsuit against Harvard alleging that administrators mishandled her claim of sexual assault. Cabot House, Leader’s former undergraduate residence, held an off-the-record conversation on sexual assault earlier this week.
Members of the Undergraduate Council hosted Tuesday's event, which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67, and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris attended.

UPDATED: March 2, 2016, at 11:19 a.m.
Speculation over Panera’s closure had barely begun before the rumors subsided and the mystery over the space's new tenant cleared: Tatte Bakery and Cafe announced it will move into Panera’s vacated storefront at 1288 Massachusetts Ave.
“For years, Panera Bread has been proud to serve and feel the support of the Cambridge community,” Panera Bread Spokesperson Amanda Cardosi  wrote in an email. “After investing in the local bakery-cafe concept Tatte Bakery and Cafe, which operates independently, Panera has decided to close our Harvard Square location.”
Cardosi added customers should expect Tatte to open later this summer.
Tatte serves a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches—with some higher prices compared to Panera—and already boasts five other locations, all in the Boston-area. This will be Tatte’s fourth Cambridge location, after branches at 318 Third St., 101 Main St., and 205 Broadway.
Several students said they are still reeling over Panera’s closure, but are excited about Tatte’s impending arrival.
Claire P. Dinhut ’18, a fan of Tatte, said she looks forward to not having to take the MBTA in order to dine at the eatery.
“In my opinion, their shakshuka is the best dish in Boston and I can’t wait to have it available at my fingertips,” Dinhut said, referring to the Israeli skillet made of poached eggs and tomatoes that Tatte serves as one of its signature dishes.
Other students, like Osaremen F. Okolo ’17, feel that a restaurant like Tatte’s is a much-needed change from the chain fast food options she said are seemingly taking over Harvard Square.
“The Square is sorely lacking in quality, no-chain, coffee options in comparison to comparable metropolitan areas,” said Okolo. “I’ll be more likely to want to sit and grab a bite in Tatte than I was in Panera.”
Okolo also characterized Tatte as having a “very true cafe vibe” in comparison to Panera.
Other students said they are excited that Tatte offers a brunch option in the heart of the Square. At Tatte’s Broadway location, the brunch menu offers dishes like a breakfast sandwich for $8.50 and an Avocado Tartine for $9.50.
“I think that Tatte is really going to revolutionize the brunch scene in the Square” Natalie C. Kim ’18 said.
Still, some students said they are disappointed about the sudden loss of Panera, but excited about a new option nonetheless.
“It's going to be hard to imagine a Harvard Square without Panera—I will miss their generous WiFi and delicious sandwiches,” Lucy Xu  ’18 said. “That being said, I've been to Tatte bakery in Kendall Square before and it's absolutely lovely so I'll be looking forward to seeing them come to the Square and treating myself to some very fine cheesecake!”

The Freshman Dean’s Office is currently considering candidates for its newly created Fellow for College Programs and Initiatives position, which will focus on reflective programming for undergraduates.
The fellow will attempt to enhance the experience of students by working closely with Katherine W. Steele, the Director of College Initiatives and Student Development at the FDO, on ways to foster personal growth during their four years as undergraduates.
“We realized that through doing this kind of programming, you can really create experiences where people can dig into these questions of  ‘Who am I?’ and ‘What’s my purpose?’,” Steele said. “Thinking about those questions now may help you later when you’re deciding what to do after you graduate.”
The Fellow will work closely with Resident Deans, Faculty Deans, Tutors, and Proctors to provide reflective guidance for students and formulate new approaches to community conversations, a required program during Opening days.
“It’s brand new,” Steele said. “This job’s never existed before… we’re going to be a start-up basically, within Harvard.”
Steele hopes to run focus groups with recent graduates during the summer, using their reflections to provide direction for new programming.
In addition to the focus groups, the FDO already possesses some historical information on the overall satisfaction of undergraduates from a 2006 study conducted by Graduate School of Education Professor Richard J. Light  involving students and their college journeys.
“Seniors said they learned a lot from chemistry and history and whatnot, but never really learned how to live life,” said Steele, discussing data the FDO obtained from the 2006 study.
Because personal growth is not isolated to freshman year, the fellow will also develop programs for upperclassmen while still operating from the FDO.
“The position is a very college focused role and is not necessarily just a response to a need that we’re seeing here at the Freshman Dean’s office,” Steele said. “This person will focus on personally transformative programming across the four years.”
Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba, who confirms all new hires, wrote that she approves of the new position’s goal of fostering personal growth among students.
“I'm glad we can support this nascent programming in personal transformation and look forward to seeing what comes of the initiatives underway in the Houses and Yard,” Thimba wrote in an email.
Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 , a freshman Undergraduate Council representative for Crimson Yard, also praised the new position.
“I’m very much in favor of this,” he said. “I think this is the FDO making an effort to really try to reach out to students as people… there’s a lot more to get out of this experience than a degree.”
Administrators have in recent years attempted to bolster College programming focused on student reflection. In 2015, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pushed for additional reflection seminars and retreats during wintersession.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the sticky floors at Toad’s Place may seem a world away from the granite walls of University Hall, the New Haven nightclub frequented by Yale students has been a topic of some discussion among Harvard administrators this year.
As debates around House life, party space, and social clubs have reached a fever pitch this year, Yale has emerged as a potential model in the College’s efforts to recenter social life in the Houses and on campus.
Discussions of Yale’s residential set-up have been particularly prevalent in the administration’s communications with members of Harvard’s non-affiliated single-gender social clubs. An official write-up of meeting notes between Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich and graduate and undergraduate leadership of final clubs, and a set of emailed recommendations from Lowell House resident tutor Eli B. Schachar offer insight into how administrators and the clubs have turned to Yale as a potential model for the College’s social scene.
“Freshmen guys are resigned to ‘stay in their rooms playing video games and pining of the day they’ll be in the Clubs,’” Schachar wrote in the email, quoting leaders of undergraduate clubs he spoke with, adding that Yale is perceived as “a more fun and socially inclusive college experience.”
Schachar said in an interview that he began meeting with several presidents of both male and female clubs shortly after an August meeting between a number of Lowell tutors and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. According to Schachar, Khurana urged the tutors to use their role as “near-peers” to the undergraduate leaders to discuss ways that the administration and the clubs could make Harvard “more inclusive.”
The common theme of his meetings with five all-male and three all-female clubs, Schachar said, was a perception that final clubs are a “symptom” of what leaders called the College’s subpar social scene. After hearing the clubs’ concerns, Schachar, drawing from his own undergraduate experience at Yale, wrote an email to Khurana, Friedrich, and then-Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde early last semester.
His message outlined “five changes the administration can pursue” to improve social life at Harvard. Schachar advocated creating a “designated party space,” similar to Toad’s, and preserving in-suite common rooms in subsequent house renovations, as opposed to the hallway common rooms in parts of Quincy’s Stone Hall, Leverett’s McKinlock Hall, and Dunster House that have drawn some criticism. He also suggested randomizing students into their house before freshman move-in, similar to how students are put into Residential Colleges at Yale, and, introducing more social activities for freshmen.
Prefaced by the words “most controversial,” he finally recommended abolishing the residential tutor system in favor of an undergraduate RA model.
All five of Schachar’s suggested policies are currently in place at Yale.
“Some of what I suggested are dramatic changes, and because of space and other constraints, I’m not even sure what’s possible,” Schachar said.
In his response to Schachar, Khurana wrote that the administration had heard “similar suggestions from other students,” adding that “the suggestions you are making are something we would have to do in a process that engages our entire community.
During his tenure as the College’s top administrator, Khurana has focused heavily on social life at the College, critiquing single-gender groups and practices he deems “exclusive.”  Behind closed doors, administrators have increasingly pressured male final clubs to admit women, and for the centuries-old institutions to rethink selection processes.
 Schachar’s policy recommendations mirror similar proposals that administrators and final clubs discussed during meetings final club graduate and undergraduate leadership.  Friedrich declined to comment on the status of any policy changes and Khurana could not be reached for comment.
At least two of Schachar’s suggestions were also brought up at spring 2015 meetings with graduate and undergraduate final club leaders. Friedrich’s meeting notes, from a Mar. 30, 2015 meeting with undergraduate leadership and a May 6 meeting with graduate leadership, also mention Toad’s by name and suggest improvements to the first-year social experience.
"The social isolation of the first year also appears to feed the growing fraternity and sorority culture as students seek a sense of belonging and connection to upper-class students,” administrators included in the notes, which were obtained by The Crimson.
The notes, watermarked “Confidential —  Not for Distribution,” are divided into two sections: “potential changes to final club policies” and “potential College administration-led social initiatives.”
Among the potential College actions listed were expanding social programming at the Queen’s Head pub, streamlining the party registration process, finding a “Harvard equivalent” to Toad’s, and “re-center[ing]” social life in the houses.
Among the potential changes to club policies were the institution of guest-only policies, shortening initiation processes, replacing punch with an “open application” system, and allowing co-ed membership.
In the fall, both the Spee and the Fox added women to their ranks. Though Khurana has kept quiet on his involvement in these changes, dozens of Fox club leadership emails obtained by The Crimson indicate an acute fear of increased administrative oversight on all-male final clubs. Fox club undergraduates framed the concern in their letter to graduates as a prominent factor in their decision to go co-ed.
Administrators have already implemented some of the suggestions from Friedrich’s notes and Schachar’s email by attempting to revamp freshmen social life. The College has also introduced more programming in the Queen’s Head Pub has also been part of the administration’s effort to bolster social spaces on campus.
While Dean of Yale College Jonathan Holloway wrote in an email that he and Khurana “have profited from sharing experiences and ideas” in the past, Holloway did not elaborate on any potential changes to Harvard’s residential set-up or social life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly halfway through a five year capital campaign that hopes to raise a higher education record of $6.5 billion, University President Drew G. Faust extolled Harvard’s broad societal value to hundreds of alumni and affiliates gathered on campus Tuesday night.
The event, boasting more than 750 guests in Burden Hall at the Business School, was the latest in a series of “Your Harvard” alumni gatherings around the country and world; Faust has made similar appearances in Atlanta, New York, Beijing, and Mexico City.
As of October, Harvard had raised $6.1 billion of its $6.5 billion goal, and while Faust did not say on Tuesday how much Harvard had raised since then, she elucidated some of the campaign’s goals and accomplishments so far. Harvard has raised $730 million towards financial aid during the campaign, according to Faust.
“We gather tonight to celebrate what we have achieved in the campaign so far, what you and more than 126,000 households around the world have already made possible,” Faust, clad in a crimson-colored suit jacket, said to the room full of alumni, donors, and potential donors. “We build on the generosity and ingenuity of those who came before us, those who over centuries have strengthened Harvard for an unknown and uncertain future. Like them, we must be willing to push further and reach higher as Harvard has uniquely equipped us to do.”
Faust specifically highlighted renovating the College’s 12 undergraduate Houses, building Harvard’s Allston campus, and increasing financial aid. Over the past few years, Harvard has been systematically renovating decades-old residential housing at the College—renewal will begin in Winthrop House this summer. But fundraising for the House renewal initiative has progressed relatively slower than other priorities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences campaign, according to a September report.
“We need to build, renovate, and maintain spaces worthy of the students and faculty who populate them,” Faust said. “And this campaign is helping us to do that. House renewal has breathed new life into old Quincy House—now Stone Hall—Leverett House, and Dunster House.”
Faust’s speech, largely focused on the importance of the research university, was not without some levity—she poked fun at Yale University as she underscored Harvard’s progress over the last few years.
“CS50, an introduction to computer science, is one of the most popular courses, and it’s so undeniably good that Yale gave up on teaching introductory computer science and uses our course,” she said to laughs.
Before Faust took the stage, a panel featuring Government professor Danielle S. Allen and University Professor Douglas A. Melton explored the ethical implications of modern biological and gene editing science. Neal Baer, who graduated from several Harvard graduate schools and has worked in television, facilitated the wide-ranging and intellectual discussion.
In an interview with The Crimson before the event began, Baer said that the large “Your Harvard” alumni “were one of a multitude of ways that Harvard reaches out to alums.”
“But certainly I think this a good way to do it,” he said. “To get the leading voices in front of 750 people is pretty great.”
Others, though, were trying to engage alumni for different purposes. In addition to some of the University’s most prominent alumni and power brokers, a group of protesters showed up outside the event to criticize the Harvard Club of Boston’s employment practices.
Michael D. Lewis ’93, who attended the event, had similar praises to Baer's. For alumni removed from the day-to-day of Harvard’s research and work, the academic panel was particularly interesting, Lewis said.
“I think for a lot of the alumni once you leave the university environment you don’t have a sense of who the faculty are and what they’re doing outside of the superstars whose names you see in the news all the time,” Lewis said. “But this is an event that gives you a sense of the kind of work being done and kinds of people who are doing it. I feel energized by it.”
After Faust’s speech, many alumni headed over to Shad Hall, also on the Business School campus, for what a brochure advertised as a “festive party.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, The Harvard Softball team traveled to Jacksonville, Florida to compete in the Jacksonville University Green and Gold Classic. In her collegiate debut, Rhianna Rich led Harvard (3-1) to its first three wins of the 2016 season. Rich was an offensive powerhouse - she tallied nine hits in 16 at bats and scored seven runs.
On Friday, Rich recorded two hits in each game. In her first ever collegiate game, Rich’s made her presence on the field known. She had a bunt single that set up sophomore Maddy Kaplan for a single and junior Giana Panariello for a double. In this play Rich scored her first run for he Crimson.
Later in the game, Rich teamed up with Kaplan again. Rich’s double led to freshman Meagan Lantz’s single and Kaplan’s double, allowing both freshmen to score.
Rich’s solid performance helped lead Harvard to a 7-2 win over Presbyterian College (6-5). The game marked the Crimson and Blue Horse’s first-ever meeting.
Later that same day, Rich led Harvard to another first-ever win, this time against St. Bonaventure University (1-8). Although the Crimson was down 2-0 after the first inning and the second inning passed by scoreless, Rich picked up the momentum for Harvard and helped lead a major comeback.
In the third inning, Rich hit a triple with one out, and then she scored during the next at bat when Kaplan grounded out to the second baseman. Rich shined again in the fifth inning, when she sent a long ball sailing over the right field wall, which was the first home run of her collegiate career. With this run, captain Zoe Galindo was also able to score. This was the second game in a row in which Rich scored twice.
This helped Harvard rally with five unanswered points, which won it the game.
“Rhianna came out and she didn’t play like a freshman,” Galindo said. “She was comfortable, relaxed, strong, confident.”
Rich continued to play well on Saturday against Albany (1-3), with two hits at bat. Unfortunately her efforts were not enough and the Crimson recorded their one loss of the season so far, falling to Albany 7-4.
Rich’s best game of her breakout weekend came in the final game against Jacksonville (9-7).
“Jacksonville University was suppose to be the toughest opponent of the weekend and we were playing on their home field,” Galindo said. “We play four games a weekend during Ivy League play, so being able to come out strong in that last game was going to show a lot of what we’re made of.”
From the lead-off spot, Rich went 3-for-5 with two runs and two RBI, bringing Harvard to an early lead. She then laced a triple through the left side, bringing home teammates and fellow freshmen, Meagan Lantz and Kaitlyn Schiffhauer.
“Our younger players in general are going to have a big impact on the team this year, Galindo said. “That’s going to be very exciting to see.”
Rich, a California native, played softball and soccer at El Segundo High School where she won numerous athletic and academic accolades. She was three-time first team all-league in softball, the Pioneer League Most Outstanding Softball Player in 2014 and earned a spot on Daily Breeze’s 2015 Top 10 Soccer Players to Watch in South Bay.
Rich is not the only softball standout in her family.  Her sisters Jenna Rich and Ciji Rich were both accomplished Division 1 softball players. Jenna was an NFCA All-American while playing softball for Stanford University and Ciji earned second-team All-Ivy League for Columbia University in 2008.
“The team really is a family,” Rich said. “Overall the weekend went really well, especially when we came back to beat Jacksonville under the lights after a loss from Albany. I think it showed how resilient the team is and how this season we’re going to play big and go all out.”
Rich currently leads the team statistics in almost all hitting categories. Rich has a double, two triples and a home run, more extra-base hits than any other Harvard softball player through one weekend of play.
Statistically, Rich is leading the NCAA as well. According to the yearly national rankings for NCAA Division 1 softball so far, Rich currently has a slugging percentage of 1.250, which puts her third in the nation, and a batting average of 0.583, which ranks her eighth.

The Harvard women’s rugby team (3-1, 0-0 Ivy League) is young. The team recruited six freshmen last season, and 16 of the 24 players on the team during the fall were either freshmen or sophomores. The co-captains of the team, Maya Learned and Isabel Delaura, are both sophomores. And many of these players are playing for the first time in sevens tournaments, a variation of the standard form of rugby, this spring.
“So many of the freshmen have been recruited and have rugby experience definitely helps with our preparedness initially,” freshman Akweley Okine said. “We still have older people on the team who are willing to help with anything... That’s just a good atmosphere.”
The team’s spring schedule consists of sevens tournaments rather than the standard form they play in the fall. Sevens is a variation of rugby that features seven players on both sides contrasting the typical 15 that play. Rather than an 80 minute game, each match consists of two seven minute halves. This allows for high-paced, high-scoring games. The shorter time limit enables entire tournaments to be played in a day.
“I haven’t played sevens before, but I have played 15s.” Okine said. “I definitely have a base in rugby. Sevens is a totally different animal. It’s a lot more running, and it takes a certain type of skill to move people where you want to move them on the field. A lot of the off-season has been running...improving passing, improving fitness.”
The team had a strong showing in the fall, setting their game-high points total at 111 then breaking the record again after putting up 132 against Penn on October 24. However, they ended the season with a loss to Army at the Varsity Championships.
The team returns to action this Saturday, hosting the Frostbite 7s Tournament on Cumnock Field. The Crimson will also host the Crimson 7s Tournament on March 26. They will then head to Quinnipiac for the Quinnipiac 7s on April 2 and Atlanta for the Atlanta 7s April 7-9.
“The team has come a very long way since last season, and even since the fall,” Delaura, a Crimson sports editor said. “We know the teams we’re playing, we’ve played against them a lot. We’re all feeling really ready to be back on the field.”
However, these tournaments are considered preparation for the Ivy 7s and Varsity 7s Championships in late April. The Ivy 7s Championships will be held in Princeton this season on April 23, with the Varsity 7s Championships beginning the following weekend in West Point, N.Y.
“One of the things...about the Sevens season that’s really nice is that we do get to play lots of different teams that we haven’t played previously...in addition to the Ivy League [teams],” Delaura said. “That really helps us hone our skills, try some new things out, and better prepare us for when we do play the Ivy teams.”
The Ivy 7s Championships of last spring went similarly to the Ivy Championships of this past fall with the Crimson finishing fourth. At the last Ivy 7s Championships in Princeton, Harvard finished 1-3 on the day. The Crimson opened with a loss to Dartmouth before blanking Yale 22-0. However, Harvard ended with two straight losses to Princeton and Dartmouth.
With the exception of the Atlanta and Varsity 7s tournaments, the Crimson participated in all of the sevens tournaments last season. At the Frostbite 7s, Harvard fielded both a Crimson and Black squad, rounding out a field of four with MIT and Beantown RFC. Both the Crimson and Black teams went 2-1 for a 4-2 overall record for Harvard at the tournament.
At the Crimson 7s, the team went 4-4 overall, with the Crimson team going 3-0 in pool play. The team lost to Norwich 1 in the championship, taking second place. Contrarily, the Black team, went 0-3 in pool play. The team beat Boston University 2 in the consolation game, though, finishing in seventh place. The Quinnipac 7s consisted of three matches against Quinnipac, Harvard losing all three. The team then played in the Sorenson Cup before moving onto the Ivy Championships.
“We have a great team to be the captains of,” Delaura said. “It’s an honor to be named captain. I think everyone feels a little bit of pressure going into the first tournament of the season, but I think that both Maya and I feel very strongly that we have a great team behind us.”

Despite Harvard’s tough loss against No. 9/9 Colgate in the ECAC tournament quarterfinals over the weekend, there was still much for the players to celebrate. Five of the player’s for the Crimson earned postseason honors from the Ivy League.
Co-captain and goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, senior defender Michelle Picard, and junior forward Sydney Daniels were all named to the first team all-Ivy League team. Senior forward Miye D’Oench was named to the second team. Rounding out the list is sophomore forward Karly Heffernan who was named an honorable mention.
Maschmeyer, who was honored as both an All-American and Ivy Rookie of the year after the 2013-2014 season, was named to the first team for the third year in a row. Hailing from Bruderheim, Alberta, Maschmeyer had a record setting senior season. Maschmeyer finishes her college career eclipsing the career saves record set by Erin Villiote (1991-95) with 2,448 saves. Maschmeyer also finishes her college career with the career second best save percentage (.941) and second best goals-against average (1.65).
Picard would finish her career at Harvard with an Ancient Eight first team selection, which is the first of her career. The Taunton, Massachusetts native was honored with a honorable mention in 2013. Picard’s experience of 129 games over the span of her career was a major factor in the Crimson defense averaging only 1.5 allowed goals per game in Ivy League play.
Southwick, Massachusetts native Daniels provided experience and valuable play from the left-wing all season. In Ivy League play the emerging junior found the back of the net for nine scores, as well as serving up two assists. With 21 goals Daniels led the Crimson in this category as well as recording 31 points in the season. Daniels finished the season with 0.64 goals per game, which was the ninth best average in the entire country.
D’Oench, no stranger to the bright lights as a native of New York City, shined under the arena lights this season. The senior forward received her first post-season honor after a stellar season. D’Oench led the Crimson with 37 points this season, 14 goals and 23 assists contributing to the senior’s point total.

Heffernan, sophomore from Sherwood Park, Alberta, had a solid season for the Harvard. The honorable mention is the first post-season honor that the sophomore has received from the Ivy League. Heffernan scored eight goals and dished out 16 assists for the Crimson this season, four of the goals and 5 of the assists were against Ancient Eight opponents.

Once you become a part of house life (or even if you’re particularly comfortable in Annenberg), the dhall will become essentially an extension of your room, albeit a part with more people and less dirty laundry. And sometimes, in your own room, you want to grab coffee (or, if you have more refined tastes, Diet Coke) without having to get all dressed up. Your d-hall outfit, however, is telling the rest of us camped out at brain break your whole life story. Here’s what you’re projecting:
Athlesiure (aka Health Goth)You just went to the gym. Or, alternatively, you want people to think you just went to the gym. This is decidedly an active attempt to seem casual and put together, so it looks like you’ve mastered the art of balancing all aspects of your life. This is an obvious ploy, but for some reason, it still works every time. Congrats.
PajamasThis is the end. You have a big assignment due tomorrow and you’re getting coffee so that you can start it tonight. We’ve all been there (and will be again), but it’s still embarrassing to bear witness to this particular brand of hopelessness.
Party ClothesDude, that coffee isn’t gonna sober you up in time to finish your work. Just call it quits and get a glass of water before you go to sleep. Don’t try to get cereal, though. You’re just going to make a huge mess and disturb the sad, resigned calm of everyone actually psetting in the dhall.
Business Casual You always have it together. Always. You’ve never slept through class. You go to lecture, even when it’s recorded.  Midterms don’t scare you, because you’ve actually done all the readings all semester. Teach me your ways. Please. I need to be rescued from myself.
So, there you have it. The definitive guide to what your dhall outfit says about the current state of your life. Dress like the person you want to be. Or, alternatively, just keep showing up to brain break in a onesie, because it’s cold and you have “serious work” to do.
