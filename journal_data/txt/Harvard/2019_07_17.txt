After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For an exhibition entitled “Big Plans,” the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum’s newest showcase is, at just two rooms, compact.
“Big Plans: Picturing Social Reform,” which runs from June 20 to September 15, is about landscape architecture as a 19th-century social innovation, one that the exhibit claims re-mapped the boundaries between the elite and working classes.
The exhibition cartographically charts the development of public parks in major cities, with Frederick L. Olmsted starring as protagonist in the story. Olmsted conceived New York’s Central Park and Boston’s Arnold Arboretum, Back Bay Fens, and Emerald Necklace park system as progressive antidotes to inequality — democratic luxuries that offered reprieve to the rich and poor alike, according to exhibition materials.
Exhibit curator and Harvard professor of landscape architecture Charles Waldheim gestured to a map of Central Park at the entrance of the exhibit, the day before it opened to the public. “Can we take drawings that are made in service of urban planning and hang them on the walls of the museum that has Rembrandts?” he asked. “Can they hold their own as works of art?”
Assistant exhibit curator Sara Zewde said that she thinks they can, given that the maps had “to be beautiful in order to galvanize people about an idea.” The maps on display feature parks and lakes rendered in jewel-tones of green and blue, their textures ranging from dense, webbed gridding at the center of cities to swirling mountain ranges at their outskirts.
But standing before another Central Park map, Waldheim said that there is “violence” that belies this beauty. He said that immigrants and freed slaves living on the land were displaced — and their homes razed — to create this public space.
“The tension between the erasure of the existing topography and the erasure of the existing lived experience is central to the show,” he said.
In the exhibition, sprawling plans surround an inner wall of tightly-ordered, black and white photographs by child labor reformer Lewis W. Hine. Titles of his work include “Boys of the Dumps” and “Among Ash Barrels.”
“We're interested in the contrast between these large urban plan drawings here — kind of heroic, and if you build it, aspirational things. And these tiny, little, tougher, this-is-how-it-really-is kind of images,” Waldheim said.
Also on display are archival materials from the museum’s namesake, Isabella S. Gardner. One remarkable treasure is her “Birthday Book,” which guests were invited to sign if their visit happened to coincide with their date of birth. The book is opened to a page bearing Olmsted’s signature.
Like Olmsted, Gardner had a passion for social reform. Indeed, she founded her museum “for the education and enjoyment of the public forever,” according to its website.
Waldheim said that Gardner’s museum — which sits on Olmsted’s Back Bay Fens — is just as much a part of Boston’s landscape as its parks. The line between culture and landscape is misplaced at best, he added.
“I think many people could imagine the Boston parks and their parks as preserved or conserved natural elements,” Waldheim said. “They didn't know it was erasing what was there and building something artificial.”
Zewde concurred, noting that the landscape is not a thing but a “frame of the world.”
At this exhibition, landscapes both frame and are framed.
Zewde added that she considered the exhibition to be a “microcosm” of the Gardner museum's broader mandate for social reform.
This mandate manifests today in the Neighborhood Salon Luminaries program, which gathers local artists to shape the “creative, educational, social, and political landscape of Roxbury, Mission Hill, Fenway and Greater Boston,” according to the museum’s website. Current luminary and fashion designer Nathalia JMag is working this summer with local youth to treat maps as aesthetic material and transform them into textiles.
The “Map This” fashion project kicks off a little more than a month after a group of students of color was allegedly subjected to racist and humiliating treatment on a school trip to the Museum of Fine Arts. In the past few weeks, the question of who museums are for, and of whose stories they should tell, has been asked with new vigor.
“It’s very clear that museums — cultural systems broadly — need to be more relevant to the communities they serve,” Waldheim said. “And so this show is an example of our new strategic plan, where we need to be much more focused on telling stories that matter to us, and then also be available to host conversations like this about the future of the city itself — and not just about art for the sake of art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Crimson asked Joachim Homann what a drawing is, Homann — the incoming drawings curator for the Harvard Art Museums — chose to answer a different question. “What do people do when they draw?” he asked.
“Sometimes they are visualizing information, they're structuring information, or they're capturing their observations,” he said in response to his rhetorical question. “I think of drawing first and foremost as an activity.”
The new Maida and George Abrams Curator of Drawings, Homann is the successor to Edouard Kopp, who left his post at HAM in 2018 to become the chief curator at the Menil Drawing Institute in Houston, Texas.
Homann comes to Harvard from Bowdoin, where he served as the curator for the college’s Museum of Art. There, in a 2017 exhibit, he posed a third question about the nature of drawing: “Why Draw?”
The exhibition featured works as diverse as a quotation from Mao Zedong written in Chinese ink, a trapezoid rendered thickly in charcoal, pretty pink fungi studied in watercolors, and a mother and child dyad done in pastels.
A 2014 chalk portrait by Alex Katz of Pharrell Williams — the pop singer best known for his hit song “Happy” — further stretched the range of the exhibit.
The portrait of Pharrell is a “cartoon,” here defined as a perforated preliminary drawing transferred with red chalk onto a larger canvas. This technique is one that dates back more than 500 years to the Renaissance, according to Homann.
“It was the opening picture for my show ‘Why Draw?’ because it demonstrates that old master techniques — in some particular circumstances — are still unsurpassed,” Homann said. The transmission of technique from one century to another resonated with the transmission of form from one canvas to another.
Looking towards his goals as a curator at Harvard, Homann said that he hopes to broaden the museum’s scope.
“As we're thinking about the hierarchies and biases that are often inscribed in historic collections, we might have to broaden our vision in order to include works that, for whatever reason, have not not been appreciated the same way,” he said.
He added that “descriptive,” or literal, drawings — mostly done by women — “were maybe at times not valued in the same way as the work that artists in the studio were doing — male artists especially.”
To illustrate the artistic diversity that he wants to curate, Homann referenced two different drawings: a “descriptive” bird drawing from the hand of Baroque-period botanist Maria Sibylla Merian with the contemporary watercolor “Bluebird” by Richard Tuttle.
The former is a naturalistically-rendered green plover, while the latter is a scribble that lends the impression of a winged body blotted out by intense, yellow sun.
In both cases, Homann said, drawing “is a process of bringing joy, of bringing energy, and sharpening people ability to perceive their environment.”
Though he has never been a practicing artist, Homann said that he loves “to look.”
During his childhood in Germany, Homann frequented museums. “I felt that the art that I saw and the galleries were opening up completely new ways of thinking about the world,” he said. “It helped me grow up.”
At the tail-end of earning his Ph.D. in art history and media theory at Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design, Homann took on a two-year curatorial fellowship at HAM. He went on to teach and curate at the University of Texas, Colgate, and Bowdoin, before finding himself back at Harvard.
Harvard’s significant drawings collection establishes the University as “the major North American site” for works from the Dutch Golden Age, according to HAM’s press release.
The press release further noted that Homann’s role will be to develop exhibitions and public programming to spotlight this strength, among others. Harvard spokesperson Jennifer Aubin added that Homann will work closely with the division of European and American art, the division of Modern and Contemporary Art, and the division of Asian and Mediterranean art.
Homann said, “I think that my role — the way I see it — is going to be to open the doors to those people who are excited about drawing, but don't feel that they have the expertise in the more conventional sense in order to really approach it the right way.”
But expertise — “in the conventional sense” — seems to be elusive when it comes to drawing.
“You won't get a single definition of what drawing is from me,” Homann said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote a letter to United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan last week to share his “deep concern” about uncertainty over immigration policies under President Donald Trump’s administration.
Bacow wrote in the July 10 letter that he understands the agencies have the duty and obligation to ensure that those who come to the U.S. do so legally, but that he is disturbed about the policies affecting international students and scholars. He wrote that the uncertainty surrounding immigration policies is “driving anxiety and fear” on campus.
“Students report difficulties getting initial visas—from delays to denials,” Bacow wrote. “Scholars have experienced postponements and disruptions for what have previously been routine immigration processes such as family visas, renewals of status, or clearance for international travel.”
Spokespeople for Pompeo and McAleenan did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday morning.
The Trump administration has put forward numerous policies that seek to curtail the number of immigrants that enter and live within the United States. In addition to Trump’s long-time promise to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration has widely publicized Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in major U.S. cities, and members of Trump’s administration have proposed policies that would enact a new merit-based system for legal immigrants seeking to enter the country.
Bacow’s letter was not his first attempt to address how new immigration policies impact foreign students at Harvard. In the year since his inauguration, Bacow has advocated for protecting undocumented immigrants on various lobbying trips to Washington D.C. Last year, he met with a group of faculty, staff, and students concerned with the status of Harvard’s undocumented population.
In his most recent letter, Bacow specifically pointed out Dreamers — participants of an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth brought to the U.S. by their parents to live and work in the United States — as one of the most “vulnerable” in the “current environment of uncertainty.”
“I have had the opportunity to meet many of Harvard’s Dreamers, and I have been deeply impressed by them and their determination, talent, and commitment to excel,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow also identified recipients of Temporary Protected Status — a program offering legal protection to immigrants from countries plagued by violence or natural disasters — as “at risk” under the Trump administration. The White House attempted to terminate TPS for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Sudan, but a federal court judge issued an injunction in October blocking the order. Dozens of staff members at Harvard are TPS recipients from the targeted countries.
Bacow noted that “science and security concerns” — including stricter visa policies — which affect a “few specific countries” also cause concern among students and faculty.
“While we support appropriate measures to safeguard valuable intellectual property, national defense, and sensitive, emerging technologies, singling out one country and its citizens is incompatible with the culture and mission of higher education and our national ideals,” he wrote.
Professors and researchers of Chinese descent have faced more intense inspection from U.S. airport security and when applying for American visas in recent months.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email that Bacow has been in Washington, D.C. since Monday to meet with lawmakers and attend a reception for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics’s Summer in Washington Program.
Swain noted Bacow had scheduled meetings with several members of Congress including Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Representative Lori Trahan (D-Mass.), and Representative Richard Neal (D-Mass.) during his trip.
Bacow periodically meets with legislators to discuss issues of higher education. In interviews, he has cited immigration as one of the frequent topics of discussion with policymakers.
Bacow is not meeting with Pompeo or McAleenan, but is sharing concerns outlined in his letter with legislators, according to Swain.

Correction: July 17, 2019
A previous version of this article misquoted University President Lawrence S. Bacow's letter. In fact, he wrote that singling out one country and its citizens is "incompatible" with the culture and mission of higher education. He did not write "compatible."
