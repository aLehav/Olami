After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What was it that was so alluring about Justin Bieber in 2010? There was something exuberant and undeniable about the tryhard teenybopper — something comforting about his floppy-haired shallowness and rampant consumerism that drew in a generation of fans. He seemed sweet and earnest, charming in a way that allowed us to overlook, even embrace the fact that his music sounded like it was written by a team of capitalist nudge psychologists in a last ditch effort to push purple hi-tops and snapback caps.
Back in that golden era of Bieberdom, we, the listeners, held the power. Bieber was just a kid, and when he sang “Baby, baby, baby oh” for the hundredth time, it was always wistful, a hand outreached, a single soul grasping towards a million others, simply yearning for a moment in the spotlight.
Of course, it’s been many years since the reign of young Bieber. But in the past decade, the Bieber brand has become synonymous with gold-standard hit-making: He’s collaborated with some of the biggest and most innovative names in the music industry. Given this history, “Yummy,” Bieber's first solo single in three years, has high stakes. It is the legacy of an international phenomenon, a touchstone for the sonic identity of the decade.
So why is the song so devastatingly mediocre?
The problem with “Yummy” isn’t its vapidity or its shameless social media stream-mongering. These are core parts of Bieber’s cultural footprint, and listeners simply don’t turn to Bieber for heavyweight experimentation or strong political messages. No, what really jars about “Yummy” is that Bieber has finally let down the essential facade of pop utopianism, revealing a stark truth: that Justin Bieber, who has an estimated net worth of $265 million, does not care whether you like his song. Justin Bieber is too big too fail, and no matter how substandard “Yummy” is, you still will be listening to it for the next six months, on TikTok, during YouTube makeup tutorials, and at crummy Ibiza-themed club nights across the globe.
“Yummy” itself is like the sonic manifestation of Bieber’s “scumbro” aesthetic: sagging tie-dye pullovers and greasy hair. Its triadic syncopated synths are recycled from reliable bops like Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” released just recently enough in 2016 to make the copycat style more derivative than retro. The main melodic hook is amateurish, catchy in intention but not in practice. By Bieber’s standards, the vocals sound flaccid and disinterested. The lyrics don’t even bear discussing.
“Yummy” is more than just an untimely flop for Bieber. It perfectly encapsulates the cracks starting to form in our current guard of pop superstardom. For years, popular culture was a band-aid intrepidly plastered over the gaping wound of corporate America. No longer. Where pop songs once reminded us of our individuality and the validity of our rich personal lives, “Yummy” positions the listener as the outsider, watching Justin and Hailey make out on a luxury resort, dressed head to toe in Bieber’s own apparel line, Drew House.
This isn’t music that expresses any discernible human emotion. Instead, it is background music for an already perfect life — but in a drastically imperfect word, it is derisive, and even offensive to wield power and influence like Bieber’s and still stand for so little.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The former governor of Alaska and five other prominent political figures are slated to join the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics this spring as part of their residential fellows program, the IOP announced Thursday.
Bill Walker, the former governor of Alaska, and Mark P. Harvey, a former Special Assistant to President Donald J. Trump, will join the semester’s cohort, along with former British Ambassador to the United States Lord Kim Darroch and Rohini Kosoglu, chief of staff to former presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). The class also includes Tara Setmayer, a CNN and ABC political commentator and former Republican communications director, and Tiffany Cross, co-founder and managing editor of The Beat DC.
In an email announcing the fellows, IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote that the Institute was “pleased” to bring them to the institute at such an important political time.
“At this important time in civic life we are pleased to welcome an extraordinary group of Resident Fellows from highest levels of government to national security, foreign affairs, and electoral politics,” Gearan wrote. “Our Resident Fellows are central to our mission of inspiring students to public service and model lives of consequences.”
The fellows will spend the upcoming semester on campus, each leading weekly study groups on a topic of their choice as well as mentoring a select group of undergraduate students and holding office hours.
Some of the new fellows took to social media to announce their study groups. Setmayer announced on Twitter that her study group will be called "Principle vs. Party."
“It’s never too late to stand up for what’s right!” Setmayer tweeted.
Cross tweeted that her study group will engage with representation in media and will build on her work at The Beat DC “[highlighting] stories of politics, policy, & people of color.”
Walker told the Seattle Times Thursday that he expects to base his time as a fellow around his experiences as an independent politician.
Student co-chairs of the IOP Fellows and Study Groups program Carine M. Hajjar ’21 and Eric K. Jjemba ’21 wrote in the announcement that they also look forward to welcoming the new fellows to campus.
“Given the importance of the 2020 election, Harvard students are eager to learn from and engage with this incoming class,” Hajjar and Jjemba wrote. “The relationships built among students and Resident Fellows help shape and inform our own pathway in politics and public service. We look forward to welcoming this cohort to campus this semester.”
The fellows will start their semester at the IOP beginning the week of Feb. 3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard announced its nominees for the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body — and for directors of the Harvard Alumni Association Thursday.
The Board of Overseers’ responsibilities include providing input on decisions about the direction of the University, advising top Harvard administrators, and approving certain actions taken by the University’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation. Members of the Board serve six-year terms.
The eight nominees vying for five anticipated vacancies on the Board are all Harvard degree holders from around the world. They include President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Raphael William Bostic ’87, Head of Sustainable Investing at Putnam Investments Katherine A. Collins, Chief Innovation Officer for Samsung Electronics and President of Samsung NEXT David H. Eun ’89, Senior Vice President of Merrill Lynch and freelance journalist Susan Morris Novick ’85, Executive Vice President for Intuit Inc. Diego A. Rodriguez, Princeton University Professor and 22nd Poet Laureate of the United States Tracy K. Smith ’94, Managing Director and Senior Partner at Boston Consulting Group Miki Uchida Tsusaka ’84, and Director of the Iowa Department of Education and Dean-Designate at Drake University School of Education Ryan M. Wise.
Both Rodriguez and Wise already serve on the Board of Overseers, as they are completing unexpired terms for Overseers who ended their terms early.
Elected directors of the Harvard Alumni Association serve as representatives for alumni across the University. This year’s nine nominees — running for six positions — include Senior Consultant on Sustainable Infrastructure and Energy at the Inter-American Development Bank Santiago Creuheras, Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at McMaster University Kelsey Trey Leonard ’10, Strategic Technology Adviser at iCorps Technologies Michael D. Lewis ’93, CBS Boston medical reporter and Massachusetts General Hospital physician Mallika J. Marshall ’92, CEO and Principal at Origin Investments David R. Scherer ’93, CEO of Altamont Group Sajida H. Shroff, CEO of Nova Invite Benjamin D. Wei ’08, CEO of Alariss Global Joyce Y. Zhang ’09, and Co-Founder and CEO of Not Sorry Productions Vanessa M. Zoltan.
This year’s nominations did not come without controversy. Harvard Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change within Harvard’s governance boards — backed a slate of candidates for the Board of Overseers, built on a platform of fossil fuel divestment and ensuring younger alumni were represented.
None of Harvard Forward’s five candidates were nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association. Harvard Forward declined to comment for this story.
Candidates who are not currently listed on the ballot can petition to be added to the ballot by Feb. 1.
Elections begin April 1 and close on May 19 at 5 p.m. All Harvard degree holders — except members of the Harvard Corporation and those in University instruction and governance positions — are eligible to vote by traditional paper ballot or online for the Board candidates. All Harvard degree holders are eligible to vote for Harvard Alumni Association elected directors.
