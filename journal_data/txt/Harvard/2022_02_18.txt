After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first thing that one would notice upon picking up Antoine Wilson’s “Mouth to Mouth” is its brevity. The novel is only 179 pages, divided into chapters that rarely exceed three pages — but what it lacks in length it makes up for in richness. Wilson’s vivid description, stunning characterization, and insightful exploration of morality culminate in an unforgettable book.
“Mouth to Mouth” begins at John F. Kennedy International Airport with the unexpected reunion of two old college acquaintances. The unnamed narrator waits for a delayed flight with fellow passenger Jeff Cook in the first class lounge, listening intently as Cook recounts the events of his life after college. What seems to be a mundane story about lost love turns into a thrilling sequence in which Cook saves a man from drowning with mouth to mouth.
The description of Cook performing CPR is incredibly visceral, exemplifying Wilson’s ability to appeal to the senses. When ribs crack under the weight of chest compressions, Cook can feel “bone scraping against bone.” The lifeless body is haunting: limp and blue, with foamy saltwater dribbling from cold lips. Wilson’s artistry makes it effortless for readers to empathize with Cook’s exhaustion and disgust, as well as his determination to keep the drowned man alive until he regains consciousness. This moment of resuscitation permanently entangles the lives of Cook and the man he saves, esteemed art dealer Francis Arsenault.
Every character in Wilson’s novel feels wonderfully real. His characterization exceeds simple adjectives, instead referring to people like Cook as a “thrift store Adonis” or “long haired guardian angel.” The characters jump off the page, engaging in a natural flow of conversation and reacting to situations with a range of physical movements, facial expressions, and emotions.
After the incident, Cook seeks out Arsenault, but it appears that the art dealer has no recollection of the man who saved his life. Rather than letting it go, Cook deepens his involvement in Arsenault’s existence, encroaching on his workspace and social circles. His preoccupation with Arsenault allows Wilson to open a discussion on morality.
The first subject of Wilson’s moral examination is the art dealer himself. One would expect someone who had a near-death experience to approach life with newfound gratitude. But when Arsenault continues to cheat on his wife and treat others with disrespect, Cook asks himself: Was saving him worth it? Arsenault becomes the poster child for what not to do with a second chance, quickly becoming the novel’s antagonist.
The second subject is Cook. Wilson cleverly tells Cook’s story in the third person, placing an unnamed character in the role of first person narrator instead. This distance between Cook and the narrator is crucial for allowing readers the space to question his morality. There is space for doubt to creep into their minds as to whether his motivations are genuine and virtuous. Readers are nudged even further toward suspicion when the narrator describes his skepticism and questions Cook’s reasoning, only to receive vague answers in return.
Cook’s questionable venture into Arsenault’s life also provides an intimate view of the art world. Much like he did for his characters, Wilson employs detailed descriptions of the Los Angeles art scene to make the atmosphere tangible. He guides readers to become acquainted with the unfamiliar, making great strides in dismantling the art world’s inaccessibility.
In addition to reading books and watching documentaries on the contemporary art world, Wilson took inspiration for this setting from his experiences working in the field in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He recalled in a Q&A at Powell’s Books that he entered the “strange, strange world” knowing almost nothing about it. Wilson’s personal expertise reveals itself when Cook sets foot in the art gallery, conveying the feeling of artistic alienation to readers.
Here, Wilson’s aptitude for comedy shines. Anyone who has struggled to understand contemporary art will find it impossible to suppress a chuckle when Cook looks at a collection of paintings and thinks “a child could have made these.”
Wilson’s novel is made even more captivating by its structure. Cook’s story is frequently interrupted by flashes of the present moment in the airport. These moments make the narrative flow more dynamic and remind readers that they are listening to a story just as much as they are reading a text. The dialogue in these scenes is also impressively realistic, as though Wilson had transcribed real-life conversations. Readers are hooked by what’s to come when Cook foreshadows events with direct statements like “Stick with me here” or “I’ll get to that.”
At the end of the novel, after an emotionally turbulent chain of events, Wilson seems to tie up all loose ends. And yet, the final sentence brings the conclusion into question: Did Cook leave the narrator with a lie?

An hour into a nightly TikTok scroll or daily Instagram perusal, the process starts to become monotonous: thousands of users partaking in the same trends, churning out extremely personal content made to garner clicks and views. Indeed, while these platforms can be connective, useful, and informative, they’re also platforms on which users, especially Gen Z, can kill time swiftly and assuredly for hours on end. The dissemination of information is now focused on it being interesting, fun, and incredibly quick to digest, but in an increasingly digital world, the amount of time anything can remain a novelty is shortening as consumers rapidly filter through endless content. Enter: the microtrend.
It is difficult to recall when exactly House of Sunny cardigans and dresses, patchwork jeans, Hawaiian floral print, and charm accessories became so thrillingly new and relevant. One can only say they didn’t stay relevant for long. While these trends all had overlapping moments in the spotlight, every piece shared the same fate: A quick rise in popularity, peak, decline, and finally, relative obscurity in comparison to their once-meteoric popularity. Microtrends are cycles of short-lived trends that gain a high amount of attention in a fairly short period outside of traditional trend cycles, and then fall off the grid and lose public relevance almost just as quickly. Today they are fueled by various factors: TikTok and Instagram, celebrities and influencers, and popular fast fashion retailers that sell largely disposable, trendy fashion pieces quickly, creating an accelerated and wasteful trend cycle.
Truly, social media platforms are where these trends are born, die out, and receive the most traffic and attention during their lifespan. A few particularly potent examples are Vivienne Westwood pearl chokers and the House of Sunny green Hockney dress. These two items in particular reveal a couple of microtrend patterns to interested fashion observers or social media enthusiasts.
Both pieces first received recognition as celebrities began wearing them in public. In the case of the green Hockney dress, Kendall Jenner was first seen wearing it in the summer of 2020, and celebrities and influencers like Dua Lipa, Bella Hadid, and Madison Beer have frequently been pictured wearing Vivienne Westwood’s bas-relief chokers. A little over a year ago, both these items had all the hallmarks of consumer success: sold-out stock, incredible mark-ups for resale, and consistent media presence in a condensed period of time. One of the more prominent commentaries on this mass response to microtrends speaks to the relation between social media and the “buy-in” culture that’s rapidly developing in the current microtrend consumer market. Once a product gains traction, people post and share their newest purchase in a 60-second TikTok video, or dedicate an aesthetically pleasing instagram post to their newest outfit. As more social media users see that item, they start to ask, “Will I be left out if I’m not buying in?” Eventually, the supersaturated product on social media timelines causes an opposite effect: the trend becomes tired, overdone.
As the market’s tides push the next big piece to the top of social media feeds, companies simultaneously push accelerated production cycles, generating enormous amounts of fashion waste. And that increased consumption has come at an unimaginably high environmental cost: Excessive water usage, release of microfibers and toxic material, and landfills stocked to the brim with discarded clothes. Carbon emissions are some of the most notable detriments associated with fast fashion. The environmental effects of the industry that consumers are buying into are killing the planet. Still, many brands are aware of this blight on the fashion industry’s reputation and the general distaste that the public has for this mass pollution. While many have responded to the public’s desire for “sustainable” consumption through elaborate greenwashing campaigns, a smaller subset of brands are indeed taking steps to improve their sustainability and ethical practices. Despite this supposed goodwill effort, many of those brands are relatively expensive and not an accessible option for most shoppers.
In addition to the negative effect that fast fashion has on the environment, microtrends also have personal implications on individual consumers’ identities and tastes. With buy-in culture, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand and distinguish between what’s a trend to jump on versus what a consumer actually wants to purchase and enjoy. It can become exhausting on the individual to catch up with the latest, decide whether to follow along, and at the end of the day still be caught in a somewhat uninspiring collection of new fashion fads.
Looking towards the future, consumers must start critically examining the intent and inspiration behind a certain piece or trend. Creating a basic wardrobe with stand-out statement pieces and classy items that never go out of style is a great way to break out of the microtrend cycle. Nevertheless, in the constant battle between timeless and trendy, it may be worth considering the implications of what you’re buying and admiring, and whether the item brings comfort, joy, and confidence.

On new single “Closer,” released on Feb. 10, California rapper Saweetie delivers a sensual and opulent endorsement of the rapper high life. The track is the fifth single off her upcoming album “Pretty Bitch Music,” which was originally slated to drop last June. However, the project was delayed following a meet-up between the rapper and legendary pop artist Cher. Apparently, during this encounter, Saweetie realized that her songs needed more “soul” and “spirit.”
In the meantime, though, fans are receiving plenty of consolation, as Saweetie has been dropping hit after hit. “Tap In” spawned a viral TikTok dance, “Back to the Streets” was a smooth R&B jam, and “Best Friend” got Saweetie nominated for Best Rap Song at the Grammys.
Now, on “Closer,” Saweetie teams up with Grammy-winning singer H.E.R. It was only a matter of time before these artists united: Both have roots in the Bay Area, both are half-Filipino, and both are currently titans in the female R&B/rap lane. Given their extensive rap sheets, one sees no reason that a collaboration wouldn’t be a surefire hit. And the results are indeed strong.
On the chorus, H.E.R.’s airy falsetto glides effortlessly over glistening, disco-inspired production. Heads are compelled to bop. Bodies sway instinctually. And Saweetie shows off her flow over two verses, sounding confident and relaxed. After a highly-publicized breakup with boyfriend of three years and rap superstar Quavo, Saweetie wastes no time letting listeners know she now has “three boyfriends.” The rest of the lyrics are, accordingly, silky and sexy, referencing Saweetie’s wealth and exploits. This makes way for some one-liners that are at least moderately amusing, like “You don't eat the booty, you lyin’.”
Stylistically, the track borrows heavily from the recent wave of ‘70s/‘80s pop revival pioneered by the likes of Dua Lipa and The Weeknd. Certainly, there’s nothing inherently wrong with hopping on trends, but Saweetie’s effort leaves something to be desired.
For one, there’s a resemblance to Doja Cat and SZA’s smash hit “Kiss Me More” that is more than just passing. Both songs are disco-inspired, making the drum patterns very similarly hitting. Both songs, consequently, occupy a similar grooviness. And both songs see a chart-topping female rapper connecting with a chart-topping female R&B singer. The motivation for such imitation is obvious. “Kiss Me More” was the sixth most played track of the past year, according to Billboard’s top 100 songs of 2021. It’s clear that Saweetie also hopes to capitalize on some of that success.
Inspirations aside, “Closer” is undeniably a catchy single that continues to show off Saweetie’s dexterity, as she nimbly jumps from trap to chill R&B to disco-pop. Fans will certainly be appeased as they eagerly await Saweetie’s debut studio album.

On Tuesday, Dec. 7, hundreds of leather-decked teens and twenty-somethings flocked to the Paradise Rock Club in Boston to dance and scream their hearts out to a simultaneously upbeat and gut-wrenching setlist performed by the Utah-based band the Aces.
The concert was their first headlining show in Boston and comes a little over a year after “Under My Influence,” their second album released during the pandemic in the summer of 2020. With fellow all-girl bands SAWYER and The Beaches along for the ride, the Aces — made up of lead singer and guitarist Cristal Ramirez, drummer Alissa Ramirez, guitarist Katie Henderson, and bassist McKenna Petty — put on an unforgettable show.
Even while packing their entire sophomore album and a few other songs into their set, the band still made time to connect and engage with the crowd, eliciting a laugh or a sigh from their audience with ease. In one interaction, Cristal Ramirez spoke about a particularly painful breakup and asked the audience about their own breakups or romantic slights. One audience member had been stood up that very show, causing the band to cry out in outrage and fellow audience members to yell curse words at said ditcher. They followed this rage with an appropriately longing rendition of “Cruel,” hearts collectively breaking to Ramirez’s lyrics “Why’d I have to love something bad, can’t you go and hurt someone new?”
Though the music was primarily sourced from “Under My Influence,” the Aces’ tracklist and overall portfolio were diverse enough to take the crowd through a rollercoaster of emotions. Songs like “My Phone Is Trying to Kill Me,” “Lost Angeles,” and 2021 single “Don’t Freak” each described various anxieties about attempting to find success in the industry, relationships with other people, or just intrusive thoughts — perfect representatives of the dance-pop genre. They appealed to all the lovers in the audience with picks like “Going Home” and “Zillionaire,” closing the first portion of the show with stand-out single “Daydream.” “801” and “Kelly” then spoke to some challenges the members faced being gay (3 of the 4 members identify as queer). “801” for example, details the struggles members of the band faced while growing up in a conservative and often repressive small town in Utah, while the titular “Kelly” is a woman that taunts and leads on the narrator of the song. The Aces’ enthusiastic storytelling behind each song revealed just how much they connect with their own music, highlighting their authenticity and vulnerability.
The members’ chemistry was evident — from the way they laughed with each other in between songs to the way their voices and instruments blended harmoniously without overshadowing each other. It was the band’s familiarity with each other, informed by years of friendship from high school into their early twenties, that made their performances so compelling. The intimacy of Paradise’s venue worked to their advantage, facilitating their interactions with the audience and allowing the music to saturate the space.
The Aces elected to close the show with an encore consisting of two fan-favorites from their debut, “Waiting for You” and “Stuck.” While “Waiting for You” briefly mellowed the audience out, “Stuck” had the room pulsating with energy, an unforgettable way to end the night.

The clear-cut musician-to-actor pipeline, once a Hollywood staple, appears to have been relegated to the sidelines for many of today’s biggest stars. In an era of increasingly demanding recording and touring schedules, as well as a packed musical landscape that makes it harder than ever for an artist to stay relevant, many musicians have had less time to meaningfully venture into other creative spheres.
Further complicating the diminished presence of the mere musician-actor is the rise of a relatively new multihyphenate, the celebrity-businessperson. No longer content with simply endorsing products, many top stars have now launched entire entrepreneurial ventures of their own. Leading this trend are Rihanna’s Fenty brands, Gwyneth Paltrow’s ever-controversial Goop, and a seemingly endless cadre of celebrities populating cosmetics stores around the globe with beauty brands championing their “signature” looks.
What does this mean for film and television? Although they still get plenty of crossover from the musical realm, you just don’t see as many of today’s music stars vying for screen time as you once did. Beyoncé’s acting era for example, seems to have been left in the past. Where she was once taking on minimal live-action roles like in the “Austin Powers” franchise, she now leaves most of her contributions to film soundtracks. And she’s not alone: Many more newly-minted stars, such as Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa, have declined to try their hand at acting and instead enter the world of fragrances or, in Lipa’s case, a new email newsletter with an accompanying podcast. And with Olivia Rodrigo, a fresh recruit into the uppermost echelon of celebrity, we see an example of the exact opposite of the musician-to-actor pipeline: a young actress who used her TV career as a way to break into the music industry.
A similar trend can be seen in today’s mainstream rappers. Drake’s acting career appears to have ended with “Degrassi,” and many of his fellow chart-toppers — like Lil Nas X, Cardi B, Doja Cat, or the members of Migos — don’t seem to be keen on continuing the film and television legacies left by the likes of Tupac Shakur and Ice-T.
Although it may be less common, the benefits for those musicians who do continue to break into acting largely remain as plentiful as they have always been. Alana Haim of sister band HAIM earned widespread critical acclaim for her part in the new“Licorice Pizza,” and Rina Sawayama and Wale both have hotly anticipated film projects on the horizon with “John Wick: Chapter 4” (2023) and “Ambulance” (2022), respectively. The film musical is also doing exceptionally well right now, with 2021 additions “In the Heights,” “West Side Story,” and “Encanto” all faring well.
“A Star is Born,” first made in 1937, is perhaps the best example of the film musical as a sure role for musicians on the silver screen. Though the original film told the story of an aspiring actress played by Janet Gaynor, each subsequent remake transformed the character into an aspiring musician. Singer-actress Judy Garland took on the role in 1954, followed by Barbra Streisand in 1976 and Lady Gaga in 2018. With Garland’s casting, the film began to further the connections between music and acting, a phenomenon that only grew with each successive remake. Gaga’s 2018 version proves the culmination of this, and set the stage for acting roles to come — the most recent of those being 2021’s “House of Gucci.”
Though less common now, there are endless examples of different musical stars from different eras who have had similar career arcs and been rewarded immensely for it. Method Man and Ice Cube have had prolific and successful acting careers that continue into the present, Madonna earned acclaim for her role in “Evita” (1996), and the 2000s brought with it the smashing success of the musical film “Dreamgirls” (2006), starring Beyoncé.
Of course, in a fickle entertainment industry, even the most famous only learn that distinction after years of fighting to stay relevant. Time will only tell if more of today’s top musicians choose to dedicate a growing portion of their career to film and television. If they do, they will be led by the likes of Jennifer Lopez, who is kicking off the new year with a pair of romantic-comedy films, and Ariana Grande, whose previous status as a Nickelodeon mainstay and minor role in “Don’t Look Up” left her fans anxiously waiting for the release of her promising turn as Glinda in Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked.” Even Taylor Swift — perhaps best known in the film world as one of several big-ticket names attached to the disastrous “Cats” (2019) — is slated to make an appearance in a star-studded and yet-to-be-titled David O. Russell film.
It will certainly be interesting to see just how influential their returns to the silver screen prove to be at the box office and in the cultural consciousness.

It’s not every day that you get to see so many world-class academics go back and forth in a student newspaper. Unless you mean the past couple of weeks. Given the long institutional memory of The Crimson, we were fairly confident that we had seen it all, or at least most of it. But to see so many Harvard professors, who built long and illustrious careers with dedicated research, not be able to utilize those research skills to refrain from inserting themselves into a chaotic and developing situation they knew very little about, is, well, incredulous and concerning.
In watching the entire event unfold, many of us have lost role models whom we looked up to and whose achievements motivated us to become better thinkers and citizens of the world. If it weren’t for seeing everything happen in real time, we might have taken this as an extremely well-written piece of satire.
But alas, we wouldn’t be so lucky.
We are extremely concerned by the implications of their behavior as educators and mentors. It is safe to say that many of us decided to come to Harvard in the first place for an opportunity to be guided by the pantheon of world-class scholars here. What came with this initial decision was our assumption that these professors would care about the educational mission and care for us as students under their guidance. Perhaps we were too entitled in thinking so. We assumed that we would be safe and protected. We’re not so sure of this anymore.
The initial letter supporting John L. Comaroff read, “We are dismayed by Harvard’s sanctions against him and concerned about its effects on our ability to advise our own students.” To publicly defend a colleague who has been accused before is seemingly for our sake. The retraction letter reads, “We failed to appreciate the impact that this would have on our students, and we were lacking full information about the case.” To take back that support is also seemingly for our sake. Between these two statements, we’re not quite sure which one to trust. Actually, we don’t have much trust left at all.
As students, we have been brought into a situation we have no control over. As a student newspaper, we have been deemed a resource for survivors seeking justice, because bad press seems to be a stronger reason to act than the accumulated knowledge of sexual violence on this campus. Between feeling powerless in having our collective name tossed around as justification for the questionable actions of some professors, and beyond angry for the way the three grad students were abused, we are extremely unsettled by the gut feeling that this will likely not be the last time all of this happens.
Title IX policies cannot only be brought up when someone on this campus is exposed for their crimes against members of our community. As long as discussions only happen when real people must come forth and divulge the pain they have suffered — and be injured again by gaslighting attempts to discredit them — we will never be able to develop and maintain robust policies that can protect our community.
Relying on victims to come forward and repeatedly prove the importance of Title IX protections is not only unsustainable but heinous in the way we hold victims accountable when they are not the ones committing harmful actions.
The takeaway, however, is that we must continuously discuss and improve Title IX policies so that they can be useful if they are needed. We cannot give up on looking for better ways to protect our community. Members of our community deserve to thrive and lead fulfilling lives — the guarantee of safety is a bare minimum that should never be threatened. Do not give up on this pursuit, this time actually for our sake.

Earlier this month, what the National Weather Service deemed a bomb cyclone downed about two and half feet of snow in Massachusetts and other parts of the Northeast. At Harvard, people made snowmen, stood on a frozen Charles river, and basked in what The Crimson called a “foot of icy fun.”
I broke one of the bones in my feet jumping over a particularly large puddle.
Not yet realizing that one of my bones was broken, I limped along Cambridge’s streets and carried on with my night, thinking my foot had been merely sprained. I had never broken a bone before and convinced myself that the pain was just another example of teenage melodrama.
When the doctor relayed the results of my x-ray the next morning, I was dumbfounded. Given my botched landing, my inability to walk on my left foot, and the considerable pain I was feeling, it shouldn’t have been all that surprising that I had, in fact, broken a bone. And yet, it was. I was blind to the fact that my body couldn’t handle everything, and that, in some tangible ways, I was delicate. I had somehow adopted the belief that my pain didn’t matter, and that however bad an injury felt in the moment, I could always “walk it off.” For the first time in my life, I had proof, in black and white film, that I had been critically misled.
I know I am not alone.
Black people in America learn from a young age that our pain isn’t real — that however badly we are treated, our bodies can weather it. In the media’s seemingly never-ending loop of footage featuring Black people being beaten by police officers and dramatizations of enslavers whipping the enslaved, the main takeaway is always our resiliency as a people, the teflon twin of the American Dream.
The evidence of this wide-reaching lie is heartbreaking. Multiple studies have shown that American doctors believe Black patients feel less pain and under-prescribe pain medication relative to what they would recommend for a white patient suffering from the same injuries. One 2016 study revealed that 40 percent of first and second-year medical students thought that the skin of Black people was quite literally thicker than that of white people. Implicit biases like this have made it so that Black people receive systematically worse care on average compared to white Americans. These biases, which have been immortalized by the barbarism of the Tuskegee Experiment  and medical abuse of Henrietta Lacks, have no doubt led to thousands of preventable deaths and are felt today in the cruel disproportionality of maternal mortality among Black women.
The organ that’s meant to protect our bodies from exposure to the outside world and all its dangers has become a literal target on our backs. Something for us to hate and for everyone else to fear.
The tragic irony of these racist lies is that Black people actually die sooner than white people, and that from heart disease to asthma, African Americans also get sick at higher rates. I truly believe that if Black people weren’t three times more likely to get Covid-19 than white people, the first year of America’s Covid-19 response would have been taken far more seriously and been on par with that of other industrialized countries. The millions of years cumulatively lost by Black Americans is time which the families of those that are dead can never get back.
When this moral catastrophe is understood in the context of American history, the lines between the dots quickly connect. It’s no accident that the response to the crack epidemic in Black communities was an increase in policing and harsher sentences, while the response to the opioid epidemic is not only more medical aid to affected communities but also a righteous effort to punish those who were responsible for manufacturing the crisis, as opposed to blaming the victims.
The evidence is clear and overwhelming: Black people’s health and wellbeing is not only ignored but attacked in this country because our institutions don’t feel the need to protect Black lives the same way they do white ones.
Yet, in spite of all this, there are signs of progress. I was heartened by the courage of Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles last year when they put their wellbeing before competition, even despite the immense backlash they faced from people who seemingly wouldn’t care if either one were to injure themselves or face mental health consequences for going beyond their limits.
My hope for the future is that the arts and academia accurately capture the pain and tenderness that Black people are capable of feeling as human beings. That American institutions move urgently to close these disparities in healthcare and quality of treatment for Black people. That non-Black people never confuse their pity and patronization for love and care. And my wish for Black people is that we take our health and wellbeing more seriously than we have been taught to, and that we understand the beauty and strength that lies in our inevitable fragility.

Here’s what they don’t tell you about Texas: the sunlight has a smell. Something like the texture of honey, slow and impossible to get off you once you make contact. You feel it on you all day whether you mean to or not, a persistent badge of earthy indulgence. But let’s face it: you don’t exactly mind.
But in that moment, from an icy ditch in an Iowa blizzard, sunshine felt a million miles away. Tram couldn’t stop shivering, but not from the sub-zero chill. It was the kind of shivering that comes from almost losing your life in the middle of nowhere from the passenger seat of a 2006 Toyota Camry.
Being from Minnesota, Tram is familiar with the middle of nowhere. But pitched forward in that ditch, she realized that near-death experiences severely amplified the feeling. One moment she’d been snoozing peacefully against her Squishmallow, a fuzzy blue fellow named Dean. The next, she felt the car’s wheels spinning out on a patch of black ice, and then off it into an even blacker ditch.
With the visceral crunch of metal on ice, the spinning stopped. She and her roommate, Vivien, turned to each other, shock slashed across their faces. After making sure they (and Dean) still had all their limbs, they dared to ask: Should we turn back? They had been driving for 19 hours.
Shaken as they were, Tram was not the giving up type. She certainly wasn’t the type of person to pick up and move across the country in a borrowed car with nothing to show for it. Since being evicted from campus, she’d done nothing but try, try, try, build, build, build — to varying outcomes, sure, but with universal resilience. As they waited for the tow truck, she looked back across the horizon toward Minnesota, where she’d come from. And then, inhaling Iowa’s stench of manure sharpened with snow, she steeled herself like the toes of boots in Texas, their destination.
As they say in Texas, it wasn’t her first rodeo. Tram had been building a life in Austin since last semester after googling “Best cities to live in when you’re young and broke.” The city did not disappoint. Guitars strumming amidst construction’s cacophony, a fresh adventurousness that drifted through the window along with the smell of food trucks. Tram perfected her chicken stir fry (the secret ingredient, she reports, is hella honey), in addition to the art of “heading out to study” with an overnight bag slung over her arm. But this semester, returning to Austin at 40 miles an hour after a tow truck had pulled them out of a ditch, she was searching for a more connected sense of adventure.
And Tram is the sort of person who finds what she’s looking for. Not content to smell sunlight through the window, she talked to strangers in Butler Metro Park. She wandered along new streets each day, Austin’s many streams glittering like the change she tossed into almost every open guitar case. Back at home, she’d put her aching feet up and get down to business on dating apps.
That is, until she came across a handsome profile populated almost entirely by pictures taken by water. Yet to Tram, the real beauty in those scenic photos was their subject, a fellow Harvard student with defined features and the kindest smile. He glowed in the sun. On their first date in Zilker Park, they bought a Shamrock Shake to celebrate St. Patrick’s day — and learned of their shared lactose allergy in a Texas-style standoff of who would sample the first sip.
Together they took their glow on the road in long drives to San Antonio and other destinations in the Southwest, Carlos the Camry their steadfast steed. Sun-faded paper maps and skydiving, aged ruins and fresh flowers, laughter over Home Culture dinners across the table from newfound University of Texas friends: This was the life that Tram had built.
Tram’s sister in law had once told her that she possessed mũi may mắn— a good luck nose. I realized she was right — anyone could see that Tram’s nose was good luck, even from just a passing glance. But I also knew that luck had hardly anything to do with it. Tram’s opportunities to smell sunlight — she built those herself. Tram knows how to make your life your own by always being down for adventure. Sure, sometimes you end up in an icy ditch, or sneaking out of your own apartment like you’re grounded in high school. But if you keep on going, you’ll end up gliding across the desert in the red glow of a Texas sunset, fresh blooms keeping your Squishmallow company in the backseat. Because the smell of sunlight doesn’t come to you, no matter how lucky your nose is. If there’s anything Tram has learned, the true good luck nose is the one that sniffs out adventure amidst adversity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 200 people attended a forum hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Education addressing how K-12 schools can fight climate change Thursday.
Introduced by HGSE Dean Bridget T. Long, the panel featured former U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr., CEO of Chicago Public Schools Pedro Martinez, and National Education Association President Rebecca S. “Becky” Pringle. Jennifer P. Cheatham, an HGSE lecturer, moderated the discussion.
Long kicked off the forum by explaining the environmental impact of the K-12 public education system in the United States.
“The American education system serves over seven billion meals annually with related food waste. Schools operate one of the largest mass transportation fleets in the country, with over 480,000 diesel school buses, and schools are one of the largest public energy consumers,” she said.
In 2021, King co-chaired a commission within the Aspen Institute evaluating climate action initiatives within the education sector. The commission released its K12 Climate Action Plan in September, which provides local, state, and federal policymakers with a set of recommendations for bringing sustainability and environmental justice into classrooms.
Cheatham noted schools face a slate of environmental issues driven by “air quality, safe drinking water, diesel fuel buses, underinvestment in our school buildings, food waste” and other factors.
“Yet, the opportunities are tremendous,” she said. “The vision that the report lays out, where nearly 100,000 public schools could be leaders in this area, is so compelling.”
According to King, schools can mobilize by improving their facilities and addressing climate change across academic subjects.
Schools can also provide essential resources, such as power, food, or shelter, following natural disasters, King noted.
“Sadly, we're going to have more of those climate change crises, and schools are going to have a critical role to play in terms of community resilience,” he said.
Martinez pointed to the renovation of school facilities as a chance for a shift to sustainable architecture.
“I see an opportunity for us as we renovate our buildings, as we modernize our buildings, to also address climate change,” he said.
Acknowledging the difficulty of solving environmental crises, Pringle said that sustainable practices can be integrated into schools almost immediately.
“We don't have to wait,” she said. “We have a lot to do, and like I said, it's complex, comprehensive problems and will take comprehensive long-term solutions, but there are things we can do right now.”
She called for urgent climate action to guarantee all people an adequate standard of living, free from the threat of environmental crises.
“Rolling in my head is the poetry of the Constitution. We the people, we the people, we the people,” she said. “All of us deserve that right to pursue happiness, and we can't do that if we can't breathe clean air, if we can't drink clean water, if a natural disaster wipes us out every time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Cambridge City Council discussed their plans for the city's budget for the 2023 fiscal year Wednesday afternoon in a virtual meeting.
In the nearly two-hour-long meeting, councilors questioned city manager Louis A. DePasquale and his staff on the budget’s alignment with their priorities, with multiple council members complaining about the lack of transparency in budget allocation.
As city manager, DePasquale is responsible for preparing the city budget according to goals laid out by the council. The council then votes on whether to authorize the final budget.
During the meeting, councilors told DePasquale and his staff about areas they felt deserved more attention and funding in the budget.
Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, a finance committee co-chair, read a list of priorities he said have been underfunded in previous years — including affordable housing, open space, and expanded pre-school access. He called for the council and the city manager to have a more productive dialogue than in past years about how the budget could be improved.
“If we don’t talk about where we’re lacking, we’re always going to lack there,” Carlone said.
Councilor Marc C. McGovern called for more transparency in the creation of the budget and said there should be more avenues for the Council and city staff to coordinate earlier in the process.
“We file lots of policy orders, and some may come to the point of getting into the budget, and some are still waiting on an ‘awaiting reports’ list,” McGovern said. “We never know what’s being considered or what’s not.”
“We have to figure out something where we’re just not getting the budget in May, and we’re as surprised as anybody else as to what’s in it and what’s not in it,” he added. “It sets up this conflict every year.”
In the meeting, DePasquale defended the budget staff and department heads, saying they worked to create a budget broadly aligned with council goals.
“They have gone out of their way to develop budgets to show how important we think it is to listen to the Council,” DePasquale said.
He argued that it was “unfair” to ask budget staff to implement changes so late in the budgeting process.
“The departments have been working on their budget for six months, and now they’re about ready to present it to the city manager,” DePasquale said. “So to think now, just because it hasn’t been presented, they can go about it and make all these changes, is unfair to them, and it’s unfair to the city.”
Vice Mayor Allana M. Mallon said in the meeting that she was “surprised” by the “defensive stance” of the city manager and his team when it came to working with the council on the budget.
“It makes it really hard to have a conversation about priorities when we’re just telling you what our priorities are, and we’re not necessarily feeling that reflected back by the team,” Mallon said.
As the city searches for a replacement for DePasquale, who plans to retire this summer, Carlone said that he hopes for an expanded council role in budget proceedings with the new manager.
“We’re getting ready for our new manager,” Carlone said in an interview, “and we’re going to be more proactive in establishing the budget.”

While planning her fall semester abroad, Donia A. Elmansy ’23 said she felt like she was “in limbo” as she struggled to navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic.
“It was all very uncertain,” she said. “The Office of International Education wasn't really sure if it would be able to go through with it.”
Elmansy’s planning eventually paid off, and she was able to spend the fall in Denmark.
After nearly two years defined by travel restrictions, case surges, and canceled plans, Harvard’s study abroad programs have returned. With a sense of normalcy underway, College students reflected on recent study abroad experiences and looked to the future with optimism.
Eight students studied abroad during the fall 2021 term, according to Camila Nardozzi, director for the OIE. Study abroad opportunities had been suspended since fall 2020 due to travel restrictions.
For the duration of the 2020-2021 academic year, the OIE’s Study Away program was the only study abroad opportunity and was limited to international students. The program allowed international students to enroll in local universities in lieu of attending Harvard’s online classes.
“This opportunity allowed for students to take courses in their local time zones, rather than having to take courses at all hours of the day and night, based on their location and the course schedule here in Cambridge,” Nardozzi wrote in an emailed statement.
Throughout Elmansy’s time in Denmark, Covid-19 restrictions were lax with free rapid testing available at test centers, but the advent of the Omicron variant posed challenges.
“When Omicron hit, things did get a little more chaotic because we, students, were interacting with each other,” Elmansy said.
Vladyslav “Vlad” Ivanchuk ’23 is currently studying abroad in Denmark, though restrictions have loosened once again since the initial Omicron surge.
“Denmark has zero Covid restrictions,” Ivanchuk said. “Masks are not a thing anymore.”
Ivanchuk said travel is “deeply integrated” into his studies, providing him with both academic and practical knowledge.
“This program is a nice break from [the] very stressful and high-pressure environment that Harvard sometimes is,” Ivanchuk said. “It has so far been much more relaxing and just less time-consuming to complete coursework.”
“That gave me a lot of opportunities to explore the city, meet people from all over the country — both Americans and local students in Denmark — and just expand my horizons,” he added.
B. Ashton Alexander ’23 said the pandemic “opened the door” for the opportunity to study abroad in Florence, Italy.
“When the pandemic hit, and when I ultimately decided to take a gap year, [studying abroad] was part of the motivation,” Alexander said. “Now I [had] a whole ’nother year — two more semesters where that can again become a possibility.”
“I'd be lying if I said that I wish I was on campus right now,” Alexander added. “Being able to study abroad, and just sort of the opportunities that I'm being exposed to here — wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
Elmansy, who is back on campus for the spring semester, said her experience studying abroad was “overwhelmingly positive.”
“I learned so much and was able to see so much in the world in such a short amount of time,” she said. “[At] no other point in your life will you be able to be given four months to go and see people from all around the world and live in a new environment.”
This semester, roughly half the normal number of students are studying abroad, according to Nardozzi. The OIE expects study abroad opportunities to return to pre-pandemic levels this summer and fall.
Selam Ambaw ’25, who plans to either study abroad in Spain or Argentina this summer, said the pandemic helped her realize her priorities. Ambaw hopes to immerse herself in the Spanish language while abroad.
“[The pandemic] made me certain that I wanted to try to take advantage of every opportunity to travel safely,” Ambaw said. “Learning about culture and language, being able to experience and more organically learn different things than you’d be able to on Harvard's campus is something that's really cool.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, Philip W. Lovejoy, will step down at the end of the calendar year, concluding a 20-year run at the University.
Lovejoy, who announced his departure earlier this week, first came to Harvard in 1998 to work at the Museum of Natural History. He joined the HAA in 2005 before ascending to its top post in 2014.
The HAA connects over 400,000 alumni to Harvard programming and networks. As executive director, Lovejoy oversees a staff of 40 employees managing alumni events, including reunions and Harvard Club events.
Lovejoy wrote in an email to the HAA that he plans to commit more time to running the Blue Hills Foundation, a non-profit his parents founded in 1986 that is dedicated to preserving the Blue Hills region in central New Hampshire. Lovejoy became president of the foundation following his father’s death in March 2020.
In the email, he described his decision to step down as “bittersweet.”
“I have taken on a family responsibility that will require far more of me than I can give to both organizations I love,” Lovejoy wrote. “The opportunity to further land conservation, advance climate and environmental research, and protect critical habitat is a mission I am devoting my life to.”
Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee praised Lovejoy’s leadership in an email to HAA affiliates.
“Philip has been a dedicated, thoughtful, and effective leader for the HAA over the last 18 years, undertaking critical work to reimagine the HAA Board, to bring important content to the Harvard community despite pandemic challenges, to direct the HAA to engage a changing alumni body, and so much more,” Lee wrote.
Katherine A. Kennedy ’88, vice president of university-wide alumni affairs for HAA, praised Lovejoy’s leadership in an emailed statement.
“The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging work sponsored by the HAA under Philip Lovejoy is a great example of the value-based leadership he established for the Harvard Alumni Association stretching back at least five years, renewed with zeal during Summer 2020, and continuing today,” she wrote.
HAA President Vanessa W. Liu ’96 wrote in an email she has been “honored” to work with Lovejoy for the eight years he has been executive director.
“I'm honored to have served under his leadership for all 8 years he's been Executive Director,” Liu wrote. “Future generations of Harvard alumni will benefit from his work and we are grateful for his impact. He will be very missed.”
Lee wrote that the HAA will hire an outside firm to search for a replacement. The organization will also consult with an advisory committee composed of alumni volunteers and leaders, he wrote.
Lovejoy will remain in his role until December 2022.

UPDATED: February 18, 2022 at 2:36 p.m.
Cambridge Police Department Commissioner Christine A. Elow vowed to prioritize transparency and accountability within the department in a Wednesday interview.
Last month, Elow was sworn in as the first woman to lead the department, after nearly five months as acting commissioner. During the interview, Elow discussed plans to address key challenges facing CPD such as public distrust, excessive police militarization, and barriers to transparency.
Elow said she would continue the efforts of former commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. on police demilitarization.
“We’re not at war with our community,” Elow said. “I am not about having our officers dressed in camouflage gear.”
Loren Crowe, a Cambridge resident and police reform advocate, said he is heartened by Elow’s interest in continued demilitarization.
“Time will tell what happens, but I'm encouraged by statements she’s made about continuing the work that the previous commissioner had started,” Crowe said. “There’s always more to be done.”
Elow cited the police presence at a July 2016 Black Lives Matter prayer march as a clear case of excessive militarization. Armed CPD officers dressed in military gear observed the rally and parked the department’s Lenco BearCat armored vehicle in view of the demonstrators.
“That show of force really made people feel less safe,” Elow said. “I am totally on board with what Commissioner Bard began, and I’m gonna continue on that path.”
According to CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick, the department reformed its policy on the BearCat following public backlash to its use at the rally.
Warnick wrote in an email that the BearCat’s deployment had previously been at the discretion of CPD’s tactical operations officer, but that direct approval from the commissioner is now required.
Crowe said he believes the department would be better off removing the BearCat from service entirely.
“If we need a bulletproof vehicle, there are other kinds of bulletproof vehicles that don't look like military vehicles,” Crowe said. “It looks bad and it creates distrust with the community.”
Elow did not say whether she would consider retiring the BearCat specifically, explaining that she believes in “preparedness” and that some incidents call for an “alternative response vehicle” like the BearCat.
Elow said she viewed the 2018 arrest of a Black Harvard student during Yardfest – in which a CPD officer tackled the student and punched him five times in the stomach – as a learning experience.
“One of the things that I always think about is, ‘How do we do things better?’ and I think every incident that we have is an opportunity to learn,” Elow said. “We are a culture where we're always learning and always growing.”
Elow added that she wants to employ greater discretion when handling crises involving Cambridge’s student population.
“I like the idea of amnesty, right? Let’s call the University, let’s see if they have somebody who’s available to come and get this young person,” Elow said. “That's really the way I’d like to see our departments working together.”
Elow offered the use of body cameras by CPD officers as a possible reform to boost transparency within the department, emphasizing the potential benefits of assessing officer conduct objectively.
The department does not currently use body cameras and would require approval from the Cambridge City Council to acquire them due to the city’s Surveillance Technology Ordinance, per Warnick.
Overall, Elow said she hopes to mend CPD’s relationship with historically marginalized groups within Cambridge, adding that she understands their distrust of the police.
“I recognize the role that the police have played in historical injustice,” she said.
Elow said she is optimistic about Council proposals for non-police emergency response alternatives, adding that she hopes CPD can collaborate with such groups in the future.
“I understand, as an African American woman, that there are people in the community that do not have a trusting relationship with the police,” Elow said. “If we can bring other groups in that can respond to people in a way that they trust and feel comfortable, I think that's great.”
“I’d love to see a place or a time when we don't need the police anymore,” Elow said of responses to some emergency calls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Retired U.S. Army Specialist Shoshana N. Johnson, who was America’s first Black female prisoner of war, discussed veterans' issues at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Thursday night.
The event, titled “Public Service and Sacrifice: A Conversation with Shoshana Johnson, America’s First Black Female Prisoner of War,” was a part of the Veterans Impact Initiative, a partnership that includes the IOP. The discussion was moderated by IOP Executive Director Setti D. Warren, who is also an Iraq War veteran.
Warren said the initiative “seeks to bridge the military and civilian divide” by exposing Harvard students to veterans’ stories.
Johnson discussed her experience as a prisoner of war, including the events leading up to her capture in 2003. After crossing the border into Iraq on an assigned mission, her unit was taken by surprise, she said.
“We went into a city, the port was secure, because we had fallen so far behind the main convoy, and we were ambushed,” she said.
Nine members of Johnson’s unit were killed in combat, and she was taken captive, along with others.
Johnson was shot in both legs, suffering a torn Achilles tendon and a fractured bone during the ambush. She was then held in captivity for 22 days before being freed by a Marine Corps rescue mission.
“I did a lot of praying,” she said of her experience in captivity.
“I had six guys that were there to support me,” she added. “When we could, we gave words of support to each other.”
Johnson said many veterans face difficulties upon returning home from combat, especially prisoners of war.
“The struggle is real,” she said. “Even with a wonderful family, even getting all the mental health care that I get being a former prisoner of war and a purple heart recipient … I still have been hospitalized three times since being home.”
Johnson said health care services provided to veterans are inadequate.
Attendee John S. Cooke ’25 asked Johnson about the rise in mental health crises among veterans, posing a question about what policymakers should do.
“I think they have a problem with opening their minds to that and opening their wallets to that,” Johnson said.
After the event, Cooke said the issue was of personal importance to him given his family members’ experiences.
“As someone from a military family and someone whose mom served 20 years in the Air Force as a Black woman, I really wanted to come out to get that experience and get her experience, especially as a prisoner of war,” he said.
Johnson also discussed the importance of legislators making sure active and former service members’ needs are met.
“These people that sit in the legislature work for us,” she added. “I think that needs to be told to them time and time again and it needs to be told to the American people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Cambridge City Council and the Cambridge School Committee discussed the long road to implementing universal pre-school during a joint roundtable discussion Monday afternoon.
Lisa Grant, the director of The Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership — a coordinating body between the city’s Department of Human Services and Cambridge Public Schools that aims to expand early childhood education — and assistant city manager Ellen M. Semonoff outlined a plan to implement universal pre-school in Cambridge by 2026.
“When we look at the entire early childhood landscape in Cambridge, theoretically there are enough seats for all the four-year-olds that live in our community,” Grant said. “It’s truly more about how we align and support what currently exists to ensure that every parent with a pre-K aged child has access to a program of their choosing that’s high-quality and is affordable.”
According to Grant and Semonoff, Cambridge will begin a planning phase of the project, working with early education providers to increase open spots for preschool-aged children and conduct a “landscape audit” of the city’s existing infrastructure for childcare.
City officials are hoping for a more formal implementation of the plan during the 2023-2024 school year. In the years afterward, the initiative would focus on scaling and assessing success.
Grant and Semonoff also explained their vision for the governance structure that would support the proposed timeline. They called for the creation of a jointly-staffed steering committee to coordinate between three task forces, which will focus on different elements of increasing access to child care and pre-K schooling.
Rachel B. Weinstein, vice chair of the School Committee, said the task forces were the “likely next step” for the city.
“We would meet more routinely to make sure that progress is happening as quickly as possible,” Weinstein said, “so that we’re not just going annually, or even biannually, to roundtables, but really more deeply involved.”
Following the presentation, Councilors raised concerns about the plan’s timeline and the accessibility of the future pre-K program.
“People need childcare from, you know, eight o’clock to six o’clock, and if they can’t afford it, we should be subsidizing it,” said Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan.
Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 added that evaluating universal pre-K requires consideration of its affordability.
“If it’s not affordable, if you’re stretching, if you feel like you have to move out of Cambridge in order to afford childcare because you’re a middle-class family, that’s not the same,” said Nolan.
School Committee member Ayesha M. Wilson — whose campaign platform called for the implementation of universal pre-K for the 2023-24 school year — said universal pre-K may help close the achievement gap between students of diverse backgrounds.
“To delay this any further is basically denying all families that ability to have that equity and access,” Wilson said in an interview.
Councilor Marc C. McGovern said the lack of urgency in implementing universal pre-K in Cambridge “infuriates” him and noted that the issue had been up for discussion since before he was elected to the School Committee in 2004.
“This is not a conversation that is new,” he said in an interview. “And yet, at the meeting, we see a proposal that has a timeline pushing universal pre-K out until 2026. Unacceptable, and not okay with me.”
McGovern said that the existing pre-school programs run by Cambridge’s Department of Human Services provide a proven model for a quality universal program and argued that further task forces and committee hearings on universal pre-k would only delay its actual implementation.
“What we got presented with is, ‘we’re going to talk about a governance structure, and then we’re going to have this task force, and we’re going to have this task force, and this other task force,’” McGovern said. “How many kids are we going to lose in that time?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson came into the final few weeks of the regular season in red-hot form, having recently been crowned Ivy League and Beanpot champions. They finished their last homestand of the regular season with three home games last weekend, against Princeton, No. 9/9 Quinnipiac, and St. Lawrence.
With the top spot in the ECAC rankings up for grabs as Harvard and Yale fight for first—with Quinnipiac not far behind—the Crimson entered this homestand knowing these games would be crucial in determining the final regular season standings.
No. 7/6 Harvard (19-7-1, 14-5-1 ECAC) opened the series of games with a 2-0 victory over Princeton on Friday, in its final Ivy League contest of the regular season. It was a surprise to none that the Crimson’s season standout and top point scorer, senior forward Becca Gilmore, was the first to strike, scoring a goal with 15:53 left in the second period. The goal brought her season tally to a whopping 16 goals, after which senior forward Brooke Jovanovich strengthened the Crimson’s lead with another goal at the very start of the third. Junior forward Anne Bloomer’s assist also saw her join Gilmore and junior forward Kristin Della Rovere in having 30+ points in the season, a feat that a trio of Crimson players have not managed to do season since the 2014-2015 season.
Saturday saw Harvard take on No. 9/9 Quinnipiac next, which ended with the Bobcats completing a comeback to edge the Crimson 2-1 despite Harvard’s early lead. Once again, it was Gilmore who managed to put Harvard ahead just 4:41 into the first period. However, after this early goal, the Crimson faltered, struggling to put together an effective offensive attack in the second and third. Quinnipiac maintained their one-goal lead until the final horn blew, as even pulling the goaltender for an extra attacker in the last two minutes couldn’t help the Crimson tie the score.
Despite the close loss to a big opponent, the atmosphere at Bright-Landry was not all that bad, as Harvard honored its nine seniors of the Class of 2022 with a postgame Senior Day ceremony.
“It was great! It’s always great to have all the senior families there, to celebrate this four-year, really five-year [including the year off due to the pandemic] journey with us,” said Gilmore. “The parents are a huge part of this program and the support we get, so it was great to get to share that moment with them.”
Finally, on Monday, in its last home game of the season, Harvard clashed with St. Lawrence in what turned out to be a very high-scoring, tumultuous game that eventually ended in a 3-3 tie, despite the Crimson managing to shoot 30 more times than their opponents. Bloomer scored her 19th goal of the season (the highest on the team), with Gilmore assisting on all three goals, bringing her points season tally up to 42—the highest for any Harvard player in the last nine years.
“Point production is just a mirror of the team’s success, and I think our team has had quite a lot of that, after a few years now. I also have to [attribute] a lot of this to my linemates, Della Rovere and Bloomer—they’ve been absolutely phenomenal. We’ve really been clicking this season, and we make each other look really good,” said Gilmore when asked about this amazing achievement.
This weekend’s results saw the Crimson maintain its second position in the ECAC rankings, two points behind the Bulldogs with two games yet to be played. These two away games, against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Union College on Friday and Saturday, respectively, will also determine whether Harvard gets to play a quarterfinal at home in the playoffs.
“I think these are two huge ECAC hockey games with six points on the line,” Gilmore said about Harvard’s upcoming final stretch. “We’re approaching this weekend like any other weekend—trying to come home with six points. Each game we should be getting better, and we should be peaking right now as we head into playoffs, so I think our goal is to really execute our game plan to the best we can and go from there.”

In hindsight, getting ice cream in the middle of a frigid Boston winter may not have been a great idea, but in the name of journalism, we decided to make the trek to the new Ben & Jerry’s located at 35 John F. Kennedy St. We had to dodge street puddles and trudge through black sludge (socks unfortunately not spared), but we eventually made it to our destination.
Customer Service
Annette: Honestly, the customer service was enough reason to visit the store. The person behind the counter was like an ice cream genie pulling out flavors we had never even heard of left and right. When we asked for recommendations, she didn’t even have to glance at the menu to know exactly what we were looking for. I wanted flavors overflowing with sugar (chocolate, caramel, and cookie dough) and without hesitation, the lovely worker suggested Phish Food and The Tonight Dough. Raymond wanted something a little more vanilla, and the worker recommended Half Baked and Milk and Cookies.
I ended up getting a small sugar cone with a scoop of Tonight Dough and a scoop of Cherry Garcia (I was stepping outside my comfort zone and incorporating fruit into my diet) for a total of $6.75. Raymond, on the other hand, stuck with the worker’s recommendation and got a small sugar cone with a scoop of Half Baked and a scoop of Milk Cookies with sprinkles for a total of $7.50.
Flavor
Annette: If an ice cream is not loaded with chocolate syrup, chocolate chunks, caramel, and cookie dough, I don’t want it… usually. One thing I was not expecting was how much I enjoyed the Cherry Garcia. It was the perfect level of sweetness to keep you wanting more (like the Fuze Raspberry Iced Tea from the dhalls) AND it had chunks of chocolate to satisfy your chocolatey needs. Overall, the flavor was a 10/10, would-recommend experience. The Tonight Dough was obviously good, but how could it not be good with all the sugar!
My only large disappointment was the fact that they didn’t have any cake cones. Gorgeous gorgeous girls are cake cone girls, and this store just did not deliver. If I’m loading up on calories in my ice cream, I need my cone to be less sweet to keep my conscious guilt free. It was unfortunate that I had to settle for a sugar cone, but I’m pretty sure the freezing cold walk to and from the shop made up for all the extra calories.
Raymond: This was my first time trying Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and honestly, it was pretty damn good. Did it live up to the hype? Not necessarily, but it was a solid cookie dough ice cream experience. The rainbow sprinkles did overpower the flavor of the actual ice cream, however, so do be aware of that when deciding whether or not to get extra toppings.
Ice cream aside, the cone (an often overlooked component of the ice cream experience, in my opinion) left a lot to be desired. We both got the classic sugar cone, but it tasted more like a mix of cardboard and the bran part of (off-brand) Raisin Bran. I was definitely disappointed, especially since I love the feeling of finally being able to take that first bite of a crunchy cone.
~Vibes~
Annette: There were no chairs! No chairs! I don’t know if this was a COVID-19 precaution (which is very understandable, of course) or just a stylistic choice, but having at least a small window booth with some stools would’ve really elevated the ~vibes~. Lack of indoor dining aside, the decor was giving middle-class house kitchen. There were those Ikea ceiling lights and wood touches that gave the store a nice clean look, but honestly the ice cream was good enough to make you forget about the interior design.
Raymond: I agree with Annette about the decor (and the chairs!), but what I really want to talk about is the marvel of engineering that is the rotating ice cream cone stand right next to the cash register. Instead of having to juggle both an ice cream cone and your wallet as you struggle to pay, your ice cream cone can safely rest itself on the stand. When you’re done paying and you’ve put away your wallet, you can then rotate the stand, pick up your ice cream, and be on your way. Life changing. Literally life changing. My jaw dropped when I saw it. I took photographs. This must have been the transformative experience I was promised when I came here.
This is it. It’s great.
Is It Worth It?
Harvard Square has a lot of ice cream shops. Like, a lot. There’s J.P. Licks, Lizzy’s, Milk Bar, BerryLine, and now (once again) Ben & Jerry’s. Did we really need another ice cream shop? No, not really, but a wider selection never hurts. While it may not be a new Curious George merch store, the Ben & Jerry’s shop does have a solid selection of the quintessential and quirky flavors they’re known for. If you’re a big fan of the flavors, this is definitely the shop for you, but otherwise, you’re probably not missing out on much by choosing one of the many alternatives to satisfy your ice cream cravings.
