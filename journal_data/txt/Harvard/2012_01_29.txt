After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from Harvard School of Public Health found that limiting protein or amino acid intake several days before surgery may reduce the risk of surgical complications.
According to the School of Public Health study, published in Science Translational Medicine, dietary intake of amino acids and protein before surgery might increase chances of health complications such as heart attack or stroke.
“We were interested in picking apart...what’s missing in the diet,” said James R. Mitchell, assistant professor of genetics and complex diseases at the School of Public Health. “What are we eating that we shouldn’t be eating?”
Previous studies over the past few decades have suggested that long-term dietary restrictions can extend longevity and slow the aging process. A recent study also demonstrated the benefits of restricting protein with fruit flies.
“What we found was that a brief dietary intervention in a mouse could protect against [surgical complications],” Mitchell said. “We wanted to know what the nutritional and genetic basis of that protection is.”
Researchers analyzed two groups of mice, with one group allowed to eat normally for 6 to 14 days while the other group ate an amino acid or protein-free diet.
When both groups were placed under surgical stress, 40 percent of the mice with a normal diet died. All of the mice with amino acid and protein-free diets survived.
According to Mitchell, he said he plans to further elucidate the nutritional basis and the underlying genetic mechanisms behind the study’s discovered link.
“Currently, there are no nutritional guidelines in and around the time of surgery. It’s just not a part of medical management specifically,” Mitchell said. “We think this might be an opportunity that, if this works in people...we can reduce stress resistance in the human body by a simple dietary restriction.”
Mitchell said that before this research can be translated to the clinical level, his team of researchers still needs to determine the optimal diet—and how long it should be maintained—for it to be effective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite some thrilling and dominant individual victories, the injury-plagued No. 25 Harvard wrestling team fell to Army in its home opener at the Malkin Athletic Center Saturday afternoon, 24-17.
After injury and illness forced the Crimson to forfeit the first two weight classes, Harvard found itself starting the match down 12 points.  But in front of a lively home crowd, Harvard went on to win five of the eight contested matches, closing the Black Knights’ lead to one before Army snatched the win.
Junior co-captain Walter Peppelman, currently ranked No. 4 in the country in the 157-lbs. weight class, described the team’s current state in terms all Harvard students can understand.
“It’s like midterm season,” Peppelman said.  “It’s that middle mile. Guys are sick, guys are banged up, but we are going to come through it. We trust our coaches, our program, and ourselves.”
Freshman Patrick Hogan started the proceedings, taking on Black Knight junior Casey Smith. After an early takedown and offensive pressure from Hogan, Smith took control of the match, capturing a 6-2 victory and putting the Crimson in a 15-0 hole.
But the co-captains led Harvard back into the match, as consecutive major decisions from No. 8 Corey Jantzen and Peppelman put the Crimson on the board.
Jantzen dominated his match with Black Knight sophomore Ryan Bilyeu from the get-go, earning his first takedown within 20 seconds. That set the tone for the match, as Bilyeu struggled to shake Jantzen, and the Harvard captain took him down twice more in the second frame. Jantzen continued his dominance in the third frame, earning an 11-0 major decision.
Jantzen’s co-captain did him one better, as Peppelman pummeled senior Jimmy Rafferty, 12-0. The bout was never in question, as Peppelman stormed out to an early lead and never looked back, blanking an opponent for the second straight week.
And after sophomore Ian Roy dropped his match to freshman Cole Gracey, things got testy in the Malkin Atheltic Center.
Crimson freshman Josh Popple, wrestling in the 174-lbs. weight class, notched an early takedown against junior Eric Gobin, but soon Army coach Joe Heskett was on the edge of the mat, arguing that the official missed a call that would have awarded Army points.
The crowd followed suit and began getting louder, as Gobin retook the lead with a takedown of his own. But Popple engineered an effective move to turn the tables and regain the lead. The freshman withstood some late tests from Gobin and finished on top, 9-7.
After whittling down the deficit to seven, Harvard was back in the match.
Sophomore Cameron Croy reduced the visitors’ lead even further. Tied late in the second period against fellow sophomore Michael Gorman, Croy used a powerful takedown to take the advantage and put pressure on the Black Knight grappler. Despite some impressive moves from Gorman, Croy added on another late takedown to win the match, 8-2.
But the match of the day came at 197 lbs., as Harvard freshman James Fox battled through an elbow injury to take on senior Derek Stanley.
“Coming into the match, I really just wanted to control the pace of the match, protect my elbow, and win,” Fox said. “I knew I wasn’t 100 percent, but I just wanted to get out there for my team and do what I could to win.”
And after a second-period escape gave him a slender 1-0 lead, Fox wiggled out of Stanley’s grips several times. Later, Stanley appeared to take the lead, but his takedown was ruled out of bounds, further incensing the Army bench. Fox survived to take the 1-0 victory.
With the win, Fox pushed the Crimson to within one, 18-17, making the day’s last match a winner-take-all contest.
But in the heavyweight matchup, Black Knight senior Daniel Mills pinned freshman David Ng inside a minute, ending the Crimson’s comeback hopes.
“If we have the guys [who had to forfeit] in the lineup, maybe we win this one,” Jantzen said. “We’re dealing with some injuries, but when we’re healthy we’re going to kick some butt.”
Harvard will be back in action against Ancient Eight foes next Saturday as the Crimson hosts Penn and Princeton for a weekend doubleheader.

With the Occupy tents gone from the Yard, life is a little simpler. But, as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and so here are a few things we dearly miss about you, Occupy.
1. No tourists in the Yard. Love it or hate it, Occupy Harvard kept tourists out of the Yard. That meant no struggling past tour groups to get to class, no watching unsuspecting tourists touch John Harvard's foot, and no photographers at Primal Scream. Alas, the tourists and their cameras are back.
2. No more excuses for being late to class. Even though it only took 1.25 seconds to pull out our IDs and show them to a guard, the increased security around the Yard was a legitimate excuse for being late to class.
3. No more Occupy jokes. We heard them everywhere: from "occupying the bathroom" to "occupy the library." Now, with the end of Occupy Harvard's encampment, these jokes have gone out of style.
4. The signs. Ninety-nine percent on exams are rare at Harvard, and seeing those Occupy signs everywhere was a welcome flashback to our high school days. Now with Occupy gone, that's one less A+ we'll see in our lives.
5. No more giving Occupy updates. Everyone wanted to know what was going on with the Occupy movement, from parents to third cousins twice removed. Now that the encampment is closed, all those distant relatives seem a little less interested in our lives.

As many of you may remember, back in July Panera Bread announced that it would be opening a new location in Harvard Square, next to Qdoba and in the spot where Bob Slate Stationer used to be. At the time, Panera expected the location to be open to the public by November. Clearly, that month has come and gone, and so the question remains: when is Panera coming to the Square?
According to Panera Bread joint venture area director Gregg T. Godfrey, the new opening date is set for the beginning of March. The setback is due to minor delays and the space is still currently under construction.
When completed, the restaurant will occupy two floors. The bottom floor will house the bakery and counter where costumers place orders, and a staircase will lead to the second floor where patrons can eat or study in front of large windows overlooking Widener Library.
Pioneering a new table service, employees at this location will bring customers' food to tables on either floor.
Panera will serve moderately priced breads, soups, and salads, catering not only to students, but also to tourists and business people in Harvard Square.
"It should feel warm and inviting," Godfery said.
