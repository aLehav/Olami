After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 24, the Academy announced the Oscar nominations for the 89th Academy Awards. There were a few surprises: “La La Land” surpassed expectations with a whopping 14 nominations to tie for the most nominated movie in Oscar history; Meryl Streep received her 20th nomination for her lead in “Florence Foster Jenkins,” breaking her own record; “Suicide Squad,” one of the biggest disappointments of the year, was nominated. The biggest surprise, however, was when the Academy broke its heavily criticized two-year streak of not nominating any people of color in any of the acting categories.
This has been a great year for film, specifically for the black community. Six black actors were nominated: Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for “Fences,” Ruth Negga for “Loving,” Mahershala Ali for “Moonlight,” Naomie Harris for “Moonlight,” and Octavia Spencer for “Hidden Figures.” “Moonlight” is the story of a young boy growing up, finding himself, and grappling with his sexuality. “Hidden Figures” is an inspiring history lesson on the critical role black women played in the Space Race. Masterly documentaries “13th,” “O.J.: Made in America,”and “I Am Not Your Negro” are exposés on black life.
This year’s nominations could instigate a permanent movement toward more inclusivity and diversity, a shift TV has pioneered. “Atlanta”, “Orange is the New Black”, and “Jane the Virgin” are among some of the countless TV shows that feature and tell the stories of people of color. Hollywood seems to be following television’s lead. The crucial difference between the two, however, is that a TV show can last years, whereas the film industry has to consistently greenlight a large variety of films featuring actors of color, something it hasn’t always done in the past and may not do in the future. Now more than ever, pushing the industry in the right direction requires not only people in front of the camera, but behind the camera as well, as directors, writers, and cinematographers.
Unfortunately, this year could be a one-off, indulgent attempt on the Academy’s part to avoid the intense backlash it received over the last two years. Alternatively, the Academy may have recognized so many black actors and films in an effort to overshadow the lack of non-black nominees of color, with the exception of Dev Patel for “Lion,” or the lack of female directors and cinematographers. It may even be an attempt to distract us from the controversial nominations of Casey Affleck and Mel Gibson, the former of whom has been accused of sexual assault, and the latter of whom has made racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, and misogynistic comments. In the aftermath of a year that has seen white men rewarded in spite of shameful behavior, this would come as no surprise.
While some of the Oscars’ choices have been dubious—both in terms of artists it nominates and nominees that win—there is no denying that recognition from the Academy automatically both validates and publicizes nominees. Recognition invariably pushes audiences to go see the nominated movies, which means encouraging people to see a few more movies with people of color this year than they would otherwise. In an industry in which money and critical acclaim are the chief sources of opportunities for artists, this could propel a new generation of actors, directors, and writers of color into the limelight.
Only time will tell if this becomes a short-lived trend or if it is a genuine effort the Academy is making to be more inclusive. And while this is a step in the right direction, it is ultimately only a balm to the bigger issues at hand. Extreme backlash, which didn’t even work to diversify last year’s nominations, shouldn’t be what forces Hollywood to recognize works of art by people of color. Nor should the film industry be praised when it does. While the industry is far from getting to where it needs to be, it will finally cross the finish line once diversity, albeit more and more recognized, becomes something that is regularly delivered, and not thrown in as an apology for its past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s time for the Oscars—a golden night of Hollywood self-congratulation. I salute this pageant of back-patting by patting some backs myself. Without further ado, here are my predictions for the 2017 Academy Awards.
Best Picture Nominees:
“Arrival”“Fences”“Hacksaw Ridge”“Hell or High Water”“Hidden Figures”“La La Land”“Lion”“Manchester by the Sea”“Moonlight”
And the winner is: “La La Land.” Almost indisputably. There’s nothing the Academy loves more than movies about itself and the city it feeds upon. A good movie, probably great, but definitely not the best picture of the year. This award should go to either “Manchester by the Sea” or “Moonlight,” two heartbreaking tales of loss and love in two very different contexts. Compared to either of them, “La La Land” seems a little empty. It’s hard to care about the struggles of two attractive artists striving for recognition, when there are other movies dealing with difficult themes like sexuality, race, and extreme loss.
Best Actor in a Leading Role
Casey Affleck, “Manchester by the Sea”Andrew Garfield, “Hacksaw Ridge”Ryan Gosling, “La La Land”Viggo Mortensen, “Captain Fantastic”Denzel Washington, “Fences”
And the winner is: Casey Affleck. From a purely artistic perspective, Affleck is able to convey the heartbreak and indignities of death and loss with a subtle and sensitive touch. However, his incredible performance is undoubtedly marred by the resurfaced allegations of sexual harassment—although the Academy may not pay attention. I don’t know how to feel about this one.
Best Actress in a Leading Role
Isabelle Huppert, “Elle”Ruth Negga, “Loving”Natalie Portman, “Jackie”Emma Stone, “La La Land”Meryl Streep, “Florence Foster Jenkins”
And the winner is: Natalie Portman. Her performance as Jackieis hailed as the best of her career, with the New York Times calling her “perfect.” But never count Meryl Streep out of an Oscar race, and this year, never count “La La Land” out of any of these categories.
Best Actor in a Supporting Role
Mahershala Ali, “Moonlight”Jeff Bridges, “Hell or High Water”Lucas Hedges, “Manchester by the Sea”Dev Patel, “Lion”Michael Shannon, “Nocturnal Animals”
And the winner is: Mahershala Ali. And it had better be. Ali had a smash hit 2016, also starring as the villain Cottonmouth in Netflix’s “Luke Cage” series. His part as Juan, a crack dealer who takes in the main character, Chiron, as his own son is unforgettable. He embraces the complexity of the role with tenderness and heart.
Best Actress in a Supporting Role
Viola Davis, “Fences”Naomie Harris, “Moonlight”Nicole Kidman, “Lion”Octavia Spencer, “Hidden Figures”Michelle Williams, “Manchester by the Sea”
And the winner is: Viola Davis. Harris is certainly excellent in “Moonlight” and could easily win this award—her depiction of a drug-addled mother inspires both disgust and sympathy. Spencer could take this home as well: Hidden Figures” is classic Oscar bait. But given Davis’s full-hearted performance in “Fences,” Harris and Spencer may not be the winners of the night.
Best Animated Feature Film
“Kubo and the Two Strings”“Moana”“My Life as a Zucchini”“The Red Turtle”“Zootopia”
And the winner is: “Zootopia.” No other film on this list was as much of a critical and box office hit, and deservedly so: the film is fun for all ages, with sight gags and cute animals for the kids, and more involved humor and even some thought-provoking plot for the parents. “Moana” has its charms as well, and is more of a visual spectacle, but it’s hard to compete with the charisma of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde.
Best Directing
Denis Villeneuve, “Arrival”Mel Gibson, “Hacksaw Ridge”Damien Chazelle, “La La Land”Kenneth Lonergan, “Manchester by the Sea”Barry Jenkins, “Moonlight”
And the winner is: Damien Chazelle. The directing category might just be another stop on the “La La Land” victory tour. Jenkins or Lonergan deserve this more than Chazelle,  and neither of these directors have gotten much attention from the Academy before. It would lovely to see their talent recognized.
All of this is still up in the air (although it is nearly statistically impossible for “La La Land” not to win at least one Oscar), but here’s my take on how Sunday night will go down. Tune in Feb. 26 at 7:30pm to find out just how right my predictions were!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night I received my Harvard acceptance letter, my mother suggested we celebrate by buying a necklace.
I remember every detail of that night, walking to a store that I usually visited to buy gifts for others. I can conjure up the specific mix of feelings that swept over me: disbelief and pride in my admission, relief knowing that high school was almost over, validation, and liberation. I felt profoundly lucky and full of glee. I’d never felt moved to buy jewelry to celebrate. But picking out a chain and three charms—a star, a flower, and a tiny gold cloud—felt fitting. I wore my necklace out of the store.
Just as vividly, I can recall my workout two Sundays ago. I was visiting my grandparents in Florida, so I had the luxury of running outside. My pace felt quicker than usual—I was lapping all of the retired gentlemen leisurely walking their dogs. And I’d made time to run on a hectic day. I’d been traveling all morning and had work to do in the afternoon, but I took the luxury of forty minutes to myself. All of this made me feel like I was on top of the world.
Until, suddenly, I felt my necklace fall to pieces. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw seemingly self-propelled flecks of gold and silver fly off of my chest. I heard the tinny bounce of charms on pavement. I thought of a cliché: “It’s funny how quickly things can change.”
All of the things that had made me happy in one second were problems in the next. If I hadn’t been running so fast, maybe the charms on my necklace wouldn’t have scattered so far. If I hadn’t been jogging on grass, maybe I would have seen where they fell. If I’d been less frantic to start my workout, maybe I would have taken off my necklace beforehand, as I usually do.
As it happened, I stood dumbfounded in the middle of an active street. I recovered the chain, the star, and the flower, but the gold cloud eluded me. For the first time in my life, the term “sentimental value” wasn’t an abstract concept. It was how I quantified the worth of my necklace to passersby.
After my run, I surprised myself when I reacted with disgust to the suggestion that I simply replace the lost charm. That felt dishonest and anachronistic. Would you ever fix the spelling errors in your childhood diary? The prospect of acting as if this casualty had never happened made me shudder.
How many minutes of thumbing through dirt and grass is a teeny gold cloud worth? How long should you stare at the ground, looking for a charm that can’t be found, when you’re trying to rebuild a broken memory? In the case of a little golden cloud that you once loved and have now lost, where is the silver lining?
It’s in the community of neighbors I met, who stopped to help me look for my cloud as they passed, even though my mission was impossible and meaningless to them. I learned by example how to be a good neighbor, and I saw proof that good neighbors exist. This second lesson is not as insignificant as it may seem. There is silver lining there.
It’s in the new memories I can associate with the necklace that remains. If anything, the sentimental value of my necklace doubled. It still has an origin story, but now its history has an inflection point. That can be a beautiful thing if I let it. Maybe the necklace wouldn’t have broken if the weekend had been like any other, but I wouldn’t trade the memories of visiting my grandparents for a piece of yellow metal. There, too, is silver lining.
It’s in the fashion-epiphany I had: The things we wear are meaningful for personal reasons in addition to historical ones. This is not something I could have learned by reading. The scholarship and more intellectual journalism about fashion tends to focus on tying it to histories of the economy, social justice, or shifts in culture, evidence of an effort to legitimize fashion as a serious (rather than frivolous) topic of discussion. I do this too. But it is much harder to describe in writing how a mere accessory can somehow capture the very essence of its wearer. Inanimate fashion objects—be they sweaters, shoes, or necklaces—truly do change when they are worn, and, in turn, change their wearers. I know this for certain now.
I often worry about how I’ll leave my mark on the world—whether I’ll make meaningful change, build something great, or affect someone deeply. But maybe it’s self-centered to care about leaving a visible legacy. Perhaps, instead, I make my impression by the small pieces of myself that I leave behind in the places I’ve visited.
I like imagining my cloud—with all of the disbelief, pride, relief, validation, and liberation that it carries—nestled in the grass in a community of caring neighbors in North Palm Beach. Perhaps the soil will absorb it over time, kneading my memories and emotions and body heat into the earth.
Or maybe a young girl visiting her grandparents for a special weekend will find it and put it around her neck, adding to it a new measure of sentimental value. If so, I hope she remembers to take it off before she goes running.

The Undergraduate Council’s new grant processing platform, “nova”, suffered a hacking attempt last week, drawing attention to their new software and its potential impact on Harvard student life. Fortunately, the hacking attempt was unsuccessful, demonstrating the robustness of the system. We certainly encourage the UC to continue to enhance the online security of its platforms, especially for software like nova that involves budgetary decisions and that has already processed as many as 111 student group applications in its inaugural semester. More importantly, however, the UC's decision to use a more transparent grants software holds numerous benefits for campus life.
We applaud the Council for their efforts to streamline the grant application process. This monetary support is vital to efforts to foster an inclusive and diverse range of thriving extracurriculars on campus. In the ongoing dialogue surrounding Harvard’s social scene, often criticized as exclusive and difficult to navigate, placing more emphasis on student organizations will only improve students' experiences.
Harvard groups enable students of similar cultural backgrounds to feel at home on an occasionally overwhelming campus. They encourage students with different political opinions to speak freely and respectfully. They bring together students of different faiths and build common ground. Protecting and advancing these clubs is in the general interest of all Harvard undergraduates: student groups are invaluable not only for the opportunities they provide for professional and academic development, but also for the tight-knit communities they build.
Measures to reform the application process and increase transparency to these organizations will enable them to better utilize the grants and increase the number of students benefitting from the College's resources. Students are now able to track their application’s process online—an improvement we wholeheartedly welcome. Further efforts to increase transparency may include more detailed updates to the student body on where funding is allocated and how grant decisions are reached.
We hope the UC will continue their work aiding student groups and providing them with financial support. While such reforms are not particularly glamorous, this type of work is a paradigm of how student government should function. Improving the grant application process is not a grand, abstract promise that can serve as a campaign slogan, but these small, concrete reforms provide a direct benefit to the student experience.

On the Feb. 16, President Donald Trump, in a press conference, asked journalist April Ryan if she could put him in touch with members of the Congressional Black Caucus because she, too, is African-American. Earlier in the month, Mr. Trump, at his now infamous Black History Month breakfast, commented, “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more”—thus revealing that the current President of the United States believes the leading abolitionist of the 19th century America to be alive and well.
Immediately before Mr. Trump’s faux pas, both Douglass and Abraham Lincoln, the president on whom Douglass had such a profound influence, celebrated posthumous birthdays. Mr. Douglass’s birthday on the fourteenth evidently went unnoticed by the White House. Two days earlier, however, on Lincoln’s birthday, Mr. Trump, taking to Instagram, misattributed to Lincoln words by the 20th century gerontologist Edward Stieglitz. One cannot help but wonder: what, if anything, does Mr. Trump know about Abraham Lincoln, whom many Americans called “The Great Emancipator”?”
Indeed, it may be fair to say that Mr. Trump, who is by all accounts not a reader, and who has repeatedly offended African-Americans, lays claim at present to being the inverse Lincoln. Mr. Trump’s style is so far from that of the sixteenth president that he appears to be reversing Lincoln’s two greatest traits: his capacity for empathy and his capacity for moral growth.
Lincoln’s empathy was legendary.  Of the slaves he once saw chained on a steamboat, Lincoln recalled, “That sight was a continued torment to me.” He also humanized the very Confederates he later instructed his armies to strangle. Coming upon a Confederate soldier in a hospital late in 1862, Lincoln, tears welling in his eyes, was said to have asked the wounded man, “Would you shake hands with me if I were to tell you who I am?"
Trump by comparison has yet to learn genuine empathy. He refers to African Americans by the objectifying term, “the blacks.” Congressman John Lewis, one of the most courageous civil rights activists in history, is according to Mr. Trump, “All talk, talk, talk―no action or results.” Such tweets by the President are virtually always ad hominem.  As Mr. Obama’s advisor David Axelrod has observed of Trump: “He has the ability to destroy people in 140 characters.”
It is true that Lincoln could be, like Trump, a man of withering words. The victims of Lincoln’s vituperative missives were errant generals such as George B. McClellan. If Lincoln were alive today, he would be a genius at Twitter. Lincoln, as historian Garry Wills and others have shown, was so entranced by the telegraph and the condensed communication it required that he pared his own language down to a pithy, 272-word endorsement of American freedom in the Gettysburg Address.
It is also true that Lincoln’s actions did not always match his moral philosophy. Despite his lifelong aversion to slavery, he was not free of racism and, before he embraced abolitionism, Lincoln hemmed and hawed. First, he deluded himself by believing that slavery would die out on its own with westward expansion. In his first inaugural address, he tried appeasing the seceding states by reiterating his promise not to tamper with slavery where it existed. Next, he embraced colonization and made condescending and racist remarks to African American leaders who visited the White House. He even flirted with compensated emancipation for slaveholders. In the end, however, influenced by his unflagging conscience and by military expedience, he wrote and signed the Emancipation Proclamation, armed the freed slaves, and won the respect of Frederick Douglass.
With less than forty percent of the popular vote, Abraham Lincoln, nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, won the presidency in 1860 via the Electoral College. While Lincoln presided over the formation of the Republican Party, many of whose diverse members were disaffected Americans opposed to the spread of slavery, Trump has presided over that party’s dissolution. In its wake, a modern Confederacy of sorts seems to be emerging, one based in part on neo-white nationalism.
Trump’s response to that nation within a nation will, in large measure, define his presidency. One can only hope that he soon walks into the Lincoln study, a room that became the White House telegraph office in 1865, shuts the door, and reads every bit of Lincoln’s writings. In those texts, he would find in Lincoln a president who frequently disappointed many Americans but who saved America in spite of itself. Mr. Trump would find a president who advised all Americans to approach the world “with malice toward none.”

After last years's Ivy League Mental Health conference aimed to raise awareness about mental illness, delegates gathered at Brown this weekend to develop concrete policy goals.
The conference, held for the first time at the University of Pennsylvania in February 2016, brought together students from all eight Ivy League schools to discuss this year’s overarching theme of “creating sustainable change.”
Conversations throughout the three-day conference centered on five broad themes: medical leave and taking time off, mental health counseling resources, improving campus accessibility, mental illness among marginalized groups, and public health policies that may be employed at universities.
Delegates from Harvard addressed shortcomings in the College’s mental health resources and vowed to enact lasting reforms.
“We really want there to be a sustained change moving forward and not just something that resulted in conversations at this conference alone,” said Stefanie Kaufman, an organizer of the conference and a senior at Brown.
Waverley Y. He ’18 said she hoped delegates to the conference would feel personally empowered to enact change on their campuses. She added that while last year, most delegates were already affiliated with peer counseling groups, this year’s delegates attended largely out of personal interest.
“I think because of that, people are going to be more invested in carrying the work forward than individual advocates, coming together as a team. I feel more confident that more action will come out of this year’s conference,” He said.
Nikki M. Daurio ’19 said her a desire to enact policy changes around mental health at Harvard inspired her to apply to be one of Harvard’s conference liaisons.
“I didn’t see any changes [last year], so we’re going to continue meetings after the conference to make sure we actually make a change, to make sure our voices are heard,” Daurio said.
The conference began with presentations research on mental health policies across the eight schools. On Saturday and Sunday, students attended various workshops on issues such as racism on college campuses and the Americans with Disabilities Act before breaking out into problem-solving groups that formulated possible policy changes.
He, who represented Harvard at the conference, said that she personally wanted to discuss the issue of mental health among students of color at the conference, and said she eventually hopes to see a multicultural center on Harvard’s campus.
“I know a lot of other schools have cultural centers that provide a sense of community and home for people who are of, for example, Asian American background,” He said. “I think some schools have Latino cultural centers or African American cultural centers, and Harvard has none of that. So I was interested in learning how other schools provide resources for students of minority background.”
Harvard administrators have for some time expressed willingness to build such a center, but cite constraints on physical space as a potential problem in its construction.
Moving forward, conference attendees plan to stay in touch through a Facebook group, where they will be able to reach out for help in advocating change at their own schools. According to Daurio, Harvard’s delegation will meet at least once a month.
In the more distant future, conference organizers plan to work towards expanding the efforts and goals of the Ivy League Mental Health Conference to non-Ivy League schools.

The discovery of seven Earth-sized planets—at least three of which may be able to support life—orbiting a nearby star has thrilled Harvard astronomy scholars and enthusiasts.
A team of astronomers published findings in the journal Nature Feb. 22 that the seven planets—40 light-years from Earth—may be prime candidates for extraterrestrial life forms. According to researchers, last week’s discovery is the first in which multiple Earth-sized planets were found orbiting the same star.
For Andrew W. Mayo ’17, vice president of the Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe and a joint Physics and Astrophysics concentrator, the discovery brought pure “excitement.”
Mayo said last week’s findings mark the largest discovery in the exoplanet field since NASA’s 2009 Kepler Space Mission, which found other Earth-sized planets much further away from Earth than Trappist-1, which the seven planets orbit. Because researchers found three planets in the habitable zone, he said, it was “a much more interesting discovery” than those made in the past.
David Charbonneau, an astronomy professor, said that the Kepler Mission revealed that small, rocky planets often orbit small stars. After the Kepler Mission concluded, Charbonneau and an astronomy graduate student conducted a follow-up study that found that about one in four stars have planets roughly the size and temperature of Earth. Charbonneau said, however, that the stars studied in the Kepler Mission were very far away.
Trappist-1’s solar system, by contrast, is only 40 light-years away, which is relatively close for astronomical research and accessible via telescope.  Charbonneau said that the relative closeness of the newly discovered planets means that astronomers may be able to “study their properties and look for life.”
Andrew M. Vanderburg, a graduate student studying planetary systems at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said he thinks “the biggest thing these planets show is that we’re on the right track.”
Mayo said he is excited to see further research on the Trappist-1 discovery.
“Everyone who is involved in astronomy on campus is very intrigued by the discovery, and beyond that, I think we’re all excited to see what people find in the coming years,” Mayo said. “There’s a lot of follow-up to be done.”
Vanderburg added that similar and follow-up projects are already happening at Harvard. Professor Charbonneau’s MEarth project, for example, which also looks for exoplanets orbiting small stars, is similar to the project that found the Trappist-1 planets. The MEarth project specifically examines stars close to Earth and looks for rocky planets with the potential to sustain life.
According to Vanderburg, the Giant Magellan Telescope will be able to detect biosignatures, or certain molecules like methane, carbon, and oxygen which signal the presence of life. This and the other telescope projects will allow scientists to analyze the seven recently discovered planets and determine whether or not they contain life relatively soon, Vanderburg said.

Building up a wall in protest, members of Harvard College Act on a Dream—an immigrant advocacy group—denounced President Donald Trump’s actions and rhetoric against undocumented individuals at a demonstration Friday.
The protest, called an “Illegal Wall Demonstration” and held in the Science Center Plaza, involved the construction of a “paper wall against hatred.” Students placed Post-it note “bricks”—with words meant to “humanize” undocumented immigrants written on them—over a banner bearing the world “illegal.” Eventually, words like “friends and family,” “Vietnamese food lover,” and “amateur photographer” covered up the term “illegal.”
In the past week, the Trump administration has expanded the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ability to enforce the nation’s immigration laws and detain unauthorized immigrants.
According to Act on a Dream Advocacy Co-Chair Bruno O. Villegas Mccubbin ’19, the purpose of the demonstration was to stand up to “the negative rhetoric about immigrants and immigrant communities that has been spewed throughout this past election cycle” and “spread some positivity and reveal the true face of immigrant communities.”
The construction of the “paper wall against hatred,” Act on a Dream Dream Advocacy Co-Chair Laura S. Veira-Ramirez ’20 said, was a form of “artivism”—a portmanteau of the words “artistic” and “activism”—as participants wrote things that defined the identities of undocumented students they knew.
Enrique Ramirez ’17 said he thought the rally served to highlight overlooked effects of Trump’s immigration order.
“In these past few days, Trump’s order is starting to come into effect and he’s implemented ICE raids that are increasing all over our country,” Ramirez said. “That’s a thing that people are generally not aware about at Harvard.”
Veira-Ramirez said that the purpose of Act on a Dream’s advocacy events were to clear the misconceptions surrounding undocumented people.
According to Veira-Ramirez, the event sought to shed light on how anti-immigrant rhetoric can categorize undocumented people into two groups—the “DREAMers, the innocent students who came here, who were brought here when they were young” and the “criminals.” Undocumented Harvard students should be aware of their privileged position as “DREAMers” in this categorization, said Veira-Ramirez.
“It’s not just affecting us; it’s affecting our families and you can’t just say you’ll support the DREAMers,” Veira-Ramirez said. “We’re kind of safe because we’re at Harvard, but we’re not the only ones at risk.”

Students and faculty gathered at Harvard Law School last week to discuss the difficulties and limitations that undocumented immigrants in the United States and the Middle East face as part of the Immigration Project's annual symposium.
Co-sponsored by Law School organizations La Alianza and the Harvard European Law Association, the conference—themed “Undocumentation"—spanned three days. Poet Marlene Mayren, a leader of an Indianapolis movement for undocumented people’s rights, delivered the keynote slam poetry performance Wednesday.
Thursday’s panel, titled “Undocumented Students in the U.S.,” focused on the challenges domestic undocumented individuals face, emphasizing how Law School students can help young undocumented people. The last panel, which took place on Friday and was titled “Documentation in the Middle East Refugee Crisis,” highlighted the complexity of the documentation process in the context of the refugee crisis.
Harvard Law student Niku Jafarnia, who helped lead the symposium, said that the conference covered multiple facets of immigration—from the international refugees to domestic undocumented issues.
Jafarnia said that planning for the event started in October, but after the election in November, Harvard Immigration Project changed the domestic panel so that it was “more focused on students.”
“Issues of undocumentation span more than students in the U.S., but I think right now that’s something so important for us to be talking about—how to help our peers who are on college campuses and what sanctuary campus means and why these things are necessary why we need education to be given to undocumented people,” Jafarnia said.
In December, University President Drew G. Faust said that Harvard would not designate itself a “sanctuary campus,” arguing that the term has no legal significance and could further endanger undocumented students. Jafarnia said she thought the decision was “unfortunate.”
“It’s incredibly important that people in positions of power stand up for those who need protection the most, and even actions such as stating Harvard is a sanctuary campus regardless of what that actually entails,” Jafarnia said. “I think would have been a really strong statement out of support for a lot of the students here.”
Harvard has increased the support it offers undocumented students since Trump assumed power. Among other measures, the University has designated a staff member at the College and hired a full-time attorney to support undocumented students.
At Friday’s event, panelist Rachel Levitan, an associate vice president of the refugee advocacy group HIAS, described the need to “recognize the role that documentation plays in the lives of forced migrants globally.”
“Documentation really unlocks people’s access to basic human rights and with those rights, people have access to dignity in their daily lives,” Levitan said.
Panelists focused on recognizing the number of refugees in the Middle East seeking “access to durable solutions” such as “access to protection, human rights, and dignity in countries of asylum.” Levitan said legal documentation is crucial to attaining these rights.
“In order to be able to access those rights, one, you need to have access to ID documents or documentation that becomes support of evidence of one’s refugee claim,” she said after the panel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Student Life considered ways to make the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub—a space under Annenberg Hall—more welcoming to undergraduates at its meeting last week.
The Committee on Student Life is a student-faculty committee that explores undergraduate social life, approve new student organizations, and oversee residential policies. House Faculty Deans, students on House Committees, representatives on the Undergraduate Council, and other College administrators comprise the committee. Recently, the committee choose to temporarily stop recognizing additional clubs over concerns about the proliferation of student groups on campus.
At the meeting, committee members discussed potentially renovating the Queen’s Head to make the pub more enticing to undergraduates.
Nadine M. Khoury ’20, a UC Crimson Yard representative, said that the Queen’s Head would be a good place to host social events—potentially ones tailored to freshmen—because of its location under a freshmen dining hall and near Harvard Yard.
“Currently, the pub is mostly graduate students. Really, we want to make it more of an undergraduate pub.” Khoury said. “It could be something very much for freshmen because we don’t really have that space yet—a social after-hours area for freshmen.”
According to Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, UC Vice President and one of the committee’s co-chair, the committee plans to create a student “focus group” tasked with proposing suggestions to make the Queen’s Head a more undergraduate-focused venue.
In September, the College’s Office of Student Life sponsored parties for students in each class year at the Queen’s Head as part of the College’s effort to play a larger role in funding on-campus social events. The events for sophomores and juniors were poorly-attended.
The group also discussed expedited party registration policies in the upperclassmen residences at its meeting. The committee will develop a “best practices” guide on policy registration policies, which currently differ across Houses.
Under this policy, students are able to register parties in their dorm rooms within a few hours before their events. Although each House has a different policy regarding the “fast track” party system, Khansarinia says that student feedback has generally been positive.
“We are going to work together with all the Houses, including administration and students, to put together a best practice guide that will detail what has worked and what has not worked with different ‘fast track’ party policies in the past,” Khansarinia said.  “We don’t want to impose the one-size fits all policy.”
College administrators frequently discuss the importance of re-centering social life in on-campus residential spaces. The Freshman Dean’s Office implemented a new policy earlier this month allowing first-year students to reserve dorm common rooms.
Committee members also mentioned the Smith Campus Center as a future space for undergraduate social events. Renovations to the building will likely be completed by 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a statistically significant increase in the number of concentrators in recent years, several professors say Harvard’s Statistics Department is reaching its limit.
The department has grown from just 20 concentrators in 2008 to 196 in 2015, according to department records, and Statistics faculty say they’ve sometimes scrambled to add the necessary teaching, research, and advising infrastructure to accommodate the influx of new students.
Joseph K. Blitzstein, the department’s co-director of undergraduate studies, said the concentration’s increased popularity has put a strain on a faculty that has not grown at the same rate as its undergraduate concentrators.
“There are so many students who need advising, are interested in finding research projects, and conducting summer research,” he said.
Mark Glickman, a senior lecturer on Statistics, agreed that the relatively stagnant growth of the department’s faculty has created a sub-optimal student-to-faculty ratio.
According to Statistics Department Chair Neil Shephard, the department is making a concerted effort to recruit new faculty members. The department has hired Susan A. Murphy from the University of Michigan, and, according to Glickman, hopes to add as many as four new faculty members this year.
In addition to hiring new professors, Shephard said some of the necessary changes would have to happen internally.
“A number of colleagues within our Department are used to being in a small Department and as we grow we need to change, becoming more intellectually diverse and to more fully embrace the tenure track system,” Shephard wrote. “It is an exciting time for our Department, but change is difficult for people and institutions.”
Shephard wrote in an email that the discipline’s growth in popularity was likely a result of Harvard’s increased focus on fields like data science.
“In recent years statistics and data science (which at its heart is an equal partnership of statistics and computer science) has moved to be at the center of modern Harvard research and education,” Shephard wrote. “Our faculty, PhD students and staff have high demands placed upon them and our Department needs to grow.”
Despite record interest in Statistics at Harvard, Shephard wrote that peer institutions’ statistics departments are often much larger.
“[Harvard Statistics] is currently much smaller (typically 1/2 to 1/3 the size) than its competitor institutions, such at Stanford, Berkeley, Chicago, Penn and Columbia,” he wrote.
Shephard, Blitzstein, and Glickman, said deans within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have been sympathetic toward the need for increased capacity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scholars from the greater Boston area came together Friday to present research on the global food system, with many arguing for a more environmentally friendly approach to agriculture and food consumption.
“Global Food+ 2017,” hosted by Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, featured four hours of presentations from 24 researchers discussing the intersections of “food, agriculture, health, society and the environment” from social, natural, and life science perspectives.
William C. Clark, a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School who organized the event, remarked on the rationale behind the symposium.
“It is an effort to celebrate the quite phenomenal research activity going on in the Greater Boston area by whole range of institutions, by researchers from almost every imaginable discipline, most of whom don’t talk to each other most of the time,” he said.
Kennedy School adjunct professor Kenneth M. Strzepek highlighted the trade-off between energy and food, and cautioned against the dangers associated with the application of free-market principles to agricultural markets.
“It becomes a value judgement—renewable energy versus food. If we try to go to biofuel. In almost all cases, we find that, it is going to have an impact on food security,” he said. “If we let the market come in, it's another threat to agriculture.”
Another speaker, Elizabeth M. Wolkovich, an assistant professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, predicted that due to climate change, wine makers will no longer be able to produce wine in many parts of the world.
“Under business usual scenario...large parts of Italy will no longer be able to grow wine grapes, much of Spain and some regions of France, including Bordeaux,” Wolkovich said.
The conference closed with a keynote address by Shenggan Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute, who emphasized the critical role this multidimensional research plays in policy going forward.
Meredith T. Niles, an assistant professor at University of Vermont who spoke at the event on climate change and agriculture, said she supported the event’s format.
“It actually forced me to condense and carefully think about what is critically important to communicate and to communicate to the broader public and to different types of scientists,” Niles said. “It makes for a better afternoon.”

UPDATED: February 27, 2017 at 3:50 p.m. 
This is Part II of a two-part series on Harvard's sexual assault prevention efforts. Part I, focusing on University-wide prevention efforts, ran on Feb. 23.
An annotated version of the sexual assault report, meant to accompany Parts I and II of the series, can be found here.

On a sunny Commencement Day in May 2015, former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 stood in front of Memorial Church and addressed Harvard’s graduating class, spread across rows of white lawn chairs before him. Gripping a wooden lectern, Patrick exhorted students to feel “uneasy” about problems facing society.
Many women in the crowd needed no urging—at least, not when it came to the issue of sexual assault. A sexual conduct climate survey conducted that spring revealed that 31 percent of senior female respondents suffered some form of sexual misconduct during their time at Harvard.
Sixteen percent—90 women, lookingat Patrick from their lawn chairs—reported experiencing unwanted sexual penetration or attempted penetration during that time.
The survey results, published in Sept. 2015, sparked shock and dismay across Harvard’s campus. University President Drew G. Faust called the numbers “anguishing” and pledged she would fight to change Harvard’s culture and “these kinds of realities.”
Six months after the survey’s release, a task force studying sexual assault prevention at Harvard issued a set of recommendations to help Faust keep her promise. The wide-ranging report focused particularly on the College, calling for a plan to address Harvard’s exclusive final clubs, mandating “small-group” and online prevention trainings, and requiring standardized instruction on hosting safe parties in each of the twelve undergraduate Houses.
Nearly a year after the task force published its recommendations, however, the College has made checkered progress in meeting the body’s demands.
Administrators moved swiftly to fulfill certain task force suggestions. In May 2016, just two months after the report’s publication, Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana unveiled a controversial policy penalizing undergraduate members of final clubs and Greek organizations. The College also launched a “required” online sexual assault prevention training module in Sept. 2016, though students currently face no penalties for failing to complete it.
Other recommendations, though, have been harder to enact. The College has yet to standardize safe party training across the Houses, and envisioned “small-group” sexual assault education sessions remain optional or nonexistent.
Overall, the College’s decentralized, informal relationship with the 12 undergraduate Houses, along with a perceived lack of staff and resources, has complicated its ability to fully address the task force’s recommendations—particularly those touching on students’ residential life.
'Striking the Balance'
A few weeks after the results of the sexual conduct climate survey came out, Lowell House administrators decided to act. Effective immediately, every Lowell resident had to attend a sexual assault information workshop, Lowell House Dean Caitlin M. Casey declared.
Casey wrote in an email at the time that she felt Harvard’s programming on sexual assault and relationship health issues simply “[wasn’t] good enough.”
Other Houses, however, took a different tack. While Lowell students trundled to meetings with peer educators from the group Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators, residents in some Houses underwent no required trainings.
“My House did not do that,” Jessica R. Fournier ’17 said. “It’s really variable, depending on where you live, how much training you’re getting once you’re no longer a first-year student.”
Harvard has long juggled administrative oversight with House independence. Faculty Deans do not regularly update the Dean of the College on their progress on the task force recommendations, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
This informal structure has complicated the College’s ability to enact new sexual assault prevention trainings in the Houses. Though all freshmen attend mandatory sexual assault information sessions when they first arrive on campus, many education initiatives for upperclassmen remain optional, and programming varies House to House.
In particular, the College has found it difficult to heed the task force’s call to “formalize and standardize” training on hosting safe parties across Harvard’s Houses. To date, at least two Houses—Mather and Cabot—have implemented party registration systems requiring students to participate in alcohol education workshops before hosting parties, though both did so before the report’s publication.
Faculty and resident deans from the other 10 Houses did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Multiple College administrators contacted for this story said they were unsure which Houses had enacted safe party training and which had not.
Fournier, an active member of anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she finds the discrepancy in levels of trainings across the Houses unacceptable. She called the College’s response to the sexual assault climate survey and the subsequent task force report “sporadic.”
But Alicia Oeser, the director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, said top-down initiatives from the College do not work.
“The thing about mandatory programming is, if you wave a magic wand, and are like, ‘Now it’s implemented,’ I mean first of all, very logistically challenging,” Oeser said. “But also, it’s not one size fits all. Each House looks different, the number of party suites, the process for registering parties—all of this is different, so we couldn’t just go in and do the same thing everywhere.”
Emily J. Miller, the College’s Title IX coordinator, said she would “absolutely love” to see safe party training enacted in every House. But she agreed with Oeser that creating a formal, standard requirement across the Houses would be difficult.
“I think it’s easier to get by in those smaller communities, when it’s their thing, I think there’s always some resistance to top-down things,” Miller said. “But I do think it would be more efficient for the College sort of centrally to say, ‘This is now a requirement.’”
Faculty Dean of Cabot House Stephanie R. Khurana said the Houses’ mixed enforcement of safe party training—with each House deciding whether and how to participate—is typical of how “ideas develop and things happen” at the College.
She added Harvard has always struck a balance between acting centrally and allowing the Houses to pilot and develop their own programs.
“Change, you know, happens over time,” Khurana said.
'A Box to be Checked'
The task force calls for “small-group” sexual assault trainings three separate times in its 20 page report.
“The quality of education efforts must be improved,” the report reads. “Education must be delivered not in the spirit of a bureaucratic box to be checked, but as lessons that will be attended to, taken seriously, and internalized.”
To that end, the report demands that small-group sexual assault prevention trainings be required of student leaders and athletic team members, and asks that Houses periodically host small-group discussions of sexual assault-related issues for all undergraduate residents.
Eleven months later, the College has taken large-scale steps to ensure undergraduates are educated about sexual assault, including debuting an online training module. As of Jan. 2017, 67 percent of College students had chosen to complete the online course.
This semester, the College also piloted a new program for House residential tutors—called the lead CARE tutor program—that provides one tutor with additional training in sexual assault prevention and response in each House. Luke Leafgren, the resident dean of Mather House who helped coordinate the new tutor trainings, said he believes the tutors will deepen student awareness of sexual harassment and of Harvard’s resources for people who have been sexual assaulted.
But the College has made less progress implementing the task force’s recommendation for small-group trainings. OSAPR small-group sexual assault programming for student leaders and varsity teams currently functions on an “opt-in” basis, according to Oeser. Small-scale in-person trainings at every House, meanwhile, remain theoretical, though some Houses—like Lowell—have independently pursued such programs.
The College’s inability to uniformly offer smaller, more personal sexual assault trainings for students stems in part from a lack of resources, according to multiple administrators.
Leafgren said small-group, in-person trainings are valuable because they engage students’ beliefs and attitudes surrounding sexual assault. He added “culture change” will never come from students clicking through an online program.
“So I remember pondering the question of how do we provide that, where do we get the resources in terms of people hours and expertise,” Leafgren said. “The lead CARE tutor position is one way to take a stab at that and make some progress, but I think we also realize that that’s not enough.”
“I think we really want every student to have an in-person training of some kind, in-person conversation, in some format each year they’re at the College… it’s a really hard challenge,” he added.
Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten agreed with Leafgren that students should have to undergo in-person trainings, but said the College currently lacks the “numbers” to implement such a system.
Rosengarten also raised concerns about the effectiveness of the online module.
“There always are people saying, ‘Oh, what if somebody sits their dog in front of the thing, and lets it watch the computer?’ How do you know they’ve actually learned the information?” he asked. “I think it’s got to be blended. Part face-to-face, and part computer, that’s the only way it’s going to work.”
Miller, who helped develop the online training module, said the program was not intended to stand alone. She said the course focused mainly on University policy and procedure, which she called “things you can effectively take in online.”
Miller said the other side of sexual assault prevention—namely, “creating culture change around community values”—should come from in-person, small-group trainings. She said it falls to OSAPR to conduct these trainings.
But OSAPR remains a relatively small office, with just five staff members. Speaking of various programs proposed in the task force report, Oeser said that “we can’t wave a magic wand and grow more” staffers and students involved with the Office.
“There’s only so many that can be in so many places at once,” Oeser said. She added, however, that OSAPR continues to “grow” its programming.
After a separate presidential task force recommended increasing support OSAPR in 2014, administrators did increase OSAPR’s funding and double its staff by Feb. 2015. But student demand expanded right along with the Office, leaving OSAPR stretched to full capacity almost immediately, according to Oeser.
Reflecting on the College’s response to issues of sexual assault, Dean Rakesh Khurana said in an interview earlier this month he thought Harvard had made progress, but that there was still more to do.
Khurana added he hopes to create an academic and residential environment where” the equality and respect and dignity is kind of just taken for granted.”
“Until we achieve that, I’m not going to feel satisfied,” Khurana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a committee recommended barring members of single gender social organizations from holding leadership positions on the Undergraduate Council, the current UC leaders said they will meet with College administrators to discuss the proposed penalty.
A new report from a committee studying how to implement historic penalties on members of final clubs and Greek organizations recommends expanding the sanctions to include the UC. The implementation committee—which counts last year’s president and vice president of the UC among its members—presented its recommendations to Khurana, who will review them.
Starting with the class of 2021, the current policy bans members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from leadership roles in recognized student organizations and varsity captaincies. The policy could be "revised or replaced" as soon as next fall, though, and the exact impact of the committee's recommendations remains uncertain.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said at Sunday’s UC meeting they will meet with Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich Monday to discuss the fate of future UC leaders.
Sachee is a member of the all-female Bee Club, and has previously opposed the sanctions.
Khansarinia said he plans on reading the suggestions in Friedrich’s office with Sachee before casting judgements about the updated sanctions.
“The first thing will be to read the report and see what’s in it,” he said. “And then we’ll probably take some time to study it and think about it, and then regroup with the Council once it’s been released, and then voice our considerations.
Sachee said Thursday that she would not speculate on “hypotheticals,” since Khurana has not yet officially responded to the committee’s recommendations.
Khansarinia asked UC members for their opinions on the committee’s proposals, as well as any questions members had for Friedrich at the group’s general meeting Sunday evening.
Crimson Yard representative Nadine M. Khoury ’20 said she sees the UC as an organization similar to other recognized student organizations.
“If you’re going to prevent leadership from being attained by people in single-gender social organizations for regular clubs, then I don’t see how that can’t cross-apply to the UC, because we are also a community of students that elect people to leadership,” she said. “If we are going to implement the sanctions, we have to implement it at the highest level of leadership.”
Others UC members, like Elm Yard representative Adam E. Harper ’20, said the College should have no jurisdiction over whom the student body elects to represent itself.
“I would make the point that those kind of moral decisions about who should be representing you shouldn’t be made by an administration and it should be made by the student body itself,” he said.
Khansarinia said the Council’s next step should be to formulate an official response to the proposals.
According to three people involved in crafting the recommendations, the implementation committee also suggested the policy expand to include leadership of The Crimson—an unrecognized group—and increase the number of prohibited fellowships for students in single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations.
President of the Crimson Derek K. Choi ’18 said in a statement last week that the sanctions do not apply to The Crimson, as the newspaper is “editorially, organizationally, and financially independent from Harvard College.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, the Bob Kiphuth Trophy—the award given to the winner of the men’s Ivy League Swimming and Diving Championships—arrived at Blodgett Pool. After four days of competition, it will be staying in Cambridge for the next year.
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team is the Ancient Eight champion once again. Taking no chances after losing by just 21.5 points to Princeton at last year’s title meet, the Crimson (9-0, 6-0 Ivy League) took a decisive lead in the first day of the competition and never looked back. In the end, Harvard blew its competitors out of the water, posting 1705 points in its home pool to win its 24th conference championship.
“It feels amazing to be Ivy League Champions again,” senior Aly Abdel Khalik said. “There is nothing better than winning at home after losing on the road two years in a row. I am so proud of this team and what we have accomplished this season.”
The Crimson adds the title to an already impressive collection of accolades this year, which includes an undefeated regular season and an Ivy League dual championship.
“It's a surreal feeling and it's going to take some time to really sink in,” junior Koya Osada said. “Since the very beginning of the season, our goal was to bring the Ivy Championship back to Harvard. It was extra sweet to be able to win in front of our home crowd and it's a moment I will cherish for the rest of my life.”
With Princeton out of contention after its season was suspended in December, it was up to the other “killer-P” to push Harvard. Penn finished the weekend as the next-best performer with 1335 points, while Columbia posted 1208, good for third.
In its efforts to bury the Quakers, the Crimson put forth a number of record-breaking performances, beginning with the opening race of the meet, the 200 medley relay.
Seniors Jack Manchester and Max Yakubovich, junior Shane McNamara, and freshman Dean Farris teamed up for the event. The group kicked off the meet by edging Penn in a time of 1:25.52. The mark is a new best for Blodgett Pool and for Harvard.
Farris swam another record-setting time in the next event, joining up with sophomore Brennan Novak, Abdel Khalik, and fellow freshman Zach Snyder for the 800 freestyle relay. The Crimson lineup took first place by more than 13 seconds and obliterated the meet and pool records by five and six seconds, respectively.
Farris also broke the 200 freestyle school, meet, and pool record in his leg of the 800 free relay. The new mark wouldn’t stand for long, though. Later in the meet, the freshman topped his own time in the final heat of the 200 free, touching the wall in 1:31.56.
Farris’ time is the sixth-fastest in collegiate history and the fastest in the country this year, meaning that the first-year is currently the NCAA’s top-seeded athlete in the event.
Farris wasn’t finished, however. The Atlanta-dwelling rookie would go on to eclipse the pool, program, and meet record by over a second in the 100 backstroke just two events later. Manchester took second in the race, and Yakubovich ended up in third place to complete the podium sweep.
Continuing the theme of the weekend, the Harvard and Blodgett Pool records for the 100-yard freestyle would fall to Farris as well. The first-year finished with a time of 42.06, edging out junior Ed Kim for the gold.
Farris went on to anchor the 400 medley relay team to a victory in a pool, school, and meet-record time of 3:06.98. The freshman was joined by Manchester, McNamara, and Yakubovich.
At the end of the meet, Farris was presented with the Phil Moriarty Award as the highest achieving swimmer for the competition.
In the shadows of Farris’s weekend, Manchester quietly enjoyed a record-breaking solo victory of his own, beating the former school-, pool-, and meet-best marks in the 200 backstroke. Sophomore Daniel Tran finished third in the event.
For his efforts, Manchester was awarded the Harold S. Ulen Award, given to the meet’s career high-point swimmer.
Aside from Farris and Manchester, Novak set a new school record in the 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 8:50.79, good for second place. Sophomore Logan Houck touched the wall after him, with Snyder trailing close behind in fourth place. The trio improved collectively on the result in the 500 freestyle, as Novak finished first, Houck was second, and Snyder took fourth place.
The Crimson closed out the meet with another relay record to continue its successful run in the team events. Yakubovich, Manchester, Farris, and Kim outdid the former pool- and program- best times with a mark of 2:52.1 to win the 400-yard freestyle relay.
In total, Harvard swimmers set records in nine events over the course of the meet. In a dominating performance, the Crimson missed out on a podium spot in only one race and won 12 of 21 events.
Two of those victories came from Yakubovich, who defended his title in the 100 fly and chipped in a victory in the 200 as well. The senior’s time of 46.54 seconds in the 100 butterfly was a personal best and the second-fastest mark in program history.
Harvard had a successful meet on the boards as well. Although Columbia junior standout Jayden Pantel took top marks in both the one- and three-meter dives, the Crimson was the only team to send three athletes to the finals for both events.
In the one-meter dive, Harvard captured three of the top four spots, with junior Bobby Ross in second, freshman Austin Fields in third, and junior David Pfeifer just three points behind in fourth.
Pfeifer managed to surpass Fields in the three-meter event, taking third with a score of 302.4. Fields finished fourth, while Ross took second place once again.
A number of other Crimson swimmers also collected podium results to secure the win.
McNamara took second in the 100 and 200 breaststroke events, junior Steven Tan picked up a silver medal in the 50 freestyle, and Novak and Houck finished second and third, respectively, in the 1650 freestyle. Manchester also touched the wall third in the 200 Individual Medley, while co-captain Eric Ronda in bronze medal position in the 200 breaststroke.
“We're incredibly excited about the win,” Yakubovich said. “The trophy hasn't been back on Harvard soil since last time the meet was at home, and we hope to keep it here for the next few years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent years, showing up in colors other than the crimson and white to compete in the Ivy Indoor Heptagonal Championships all but guaranteed a loss.
Starting in 2013, the Harvard women’s track and field team had claimed the last four league crowns. This weekend, adding to an era of dominance that precedes even the most senior members of the squad, the Crimson traveled to the NYC Armory in New York and handedly brought home a fifth consecutive crown.
While the women’s team dashed the next closest competitor, Penn, by 19.67 points to claim first place, the men placed sixth, falling one spot from their 2016 finish of fifth.
Headlining the Crimson was ever-consistent sprinter Gabby Thomas. In what is now a characteristic performance, the sophomore broke two Ancient Eight records. The first came in preliminaries for the 60-meter dash, when Thomas finished 7.29 seconds. In finals, the sprinter neared that record again with a race of 7.31 seconds to claim her second consecutive gold in the event.
“It means a lot to me this season because I am really excited to see what I can do this year,” Thomas said. “Last year, I had no idea what I was capable of and kind of surprised myself with each success. Now I have set goals for myself, and I know what I want to accomplish. So it's a great feeling to see myself headed in the right direction.”
After remarking only four weeks ago that she hoped to break the 23-second mark in the 200-meter run, Thomas did just that. Completing the race in 22.88 seconds, a full second ahead of the rest of her competition, Thomas claimed her second Ivy League record of the day, second gold medal, and an indoor track school record just for good measure.
The sophomore wasn’t done. In the 4x400-meter run, Harvard claimed its second consecutive gold in the event. Thomas, in collaboration with freshman Zoe Hughes, senior Jade Miller, and freshman Karina Joiner dominated the competition, finishing four seconds ahead of the closest opponent for 3:42.02 race.
Thomas wasn’t the only girl to do well on the track, either, as freshmen grabbed a few medals.
In the 60-meter hurdles, rookies Livia Gauntlett and Karina Joiner placed three-four to grab points for the team. Freshman Judy Pendergast got her first taste of Ivy victory with a hard-fought gold in the 5,000-meter run. Pendergast beat off Columbia senior Natalie Tanner, who finished 1.54 seconds behind the rookie, and claimed the Crimson’s first indoor championship in the event since 2006. Teammate and junior Elianna Shwayder placed sixth in the competition, nabbing a point for the team.
Sophomore Ngozi Musa also posted her best time of the year to earn silver in the 60-meter dash at 7.45 seconds. Senior Jade Miller also posted a personal best over 400 meters to ascend to the second spot on the podium.
The field portion of the team left almost as decorated as the sprinters. Captain Reagan Nizdil set a season best in the high jump competition to earn fourth. Meanwhile, freshman Simi Fajemisin fell just 0.03 meters short of a Heps title with a 12.96 leap. While she didn’t quite get the gold, the freshman broke a 16-year school record.
Not to be outdone, the Olympian and senior Nikki Okwelogu maintained her iron-clad monopoly on the shot put event as she claimed her fourth consecutive gold medal in the event. Only the second student-athlete in Ancient Eight history to achieve that sort of dominance—and the first from Harvard—Okwelogu did so in impressive fashion. She out-threw the field by almost two meters.
“Stepping into the ring on the day of Heps is an opportunity to help my team and help contribute to a legacy,” Okwelogu said. “I'm happy to be able to earn those 10 points each Heps for my team, and getting it four years in a row is just icing on the cake.”
While the men didn’t win gold as a team, they hosted their own group of stand out performances.
Leading the group was captain Efe Uwaifo, who claimed his third straight Heps gold in triple jump. Sophomore Myles Marshall of the 800-meter race also took to the top of the podium with a title-winning run. Marshall finished in 1:48.98, earning himself the third-fastest time in school history. Not a bad day considering he holds the other two records as well.
For junior Jay Hebert, in the game of seconds, it was a day of seconds. Claiming the silver medal in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.02, the race represented his second-best ever, as well as the second best in school history.
Other highlights for the men’s team included a fifth-place finish by junior James Heckendorn in the 400-meter dash, a fourth-place finish by senior Julian Nunally in shot put, and a bronze in the 4x400 with freshman Jacob McLennan, Heckendorn, junior Matthew Hurst, and junior Alexander Moore. The quartet finished 0.69 seconds behind the gold medalists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball (20-5, 8-4 Ivy) is headed to the inaugural Ivy League Tournament.
This weekend, the Crimson punched a ticket by splitting contests against rivals Yale (14-11, 5-7 Ivy) and Brown (14-11, 5-7 Ivy). After a disheartening 57-52 loss in New Haven, Conn., Harvard bounced back with a triumph over the Bears.
The Friday-Saturday doubleheader comes near the end of a season of peaks and valleys. Between mid-November and late January, the Crimson ripped off 16 straight wins. But in recent weeks, Harvard has hit rough patches—most recently in the defeat against the middling Bulldogs.
“We do have players that can score,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We are executing our offense better. We just need them to step back up and score like they were before conference play.”
There’s no telling what the young time might achieve in the coming weeks. But one fact is certain—the Crimson will have the chance to keep on playing.
Both new and veteran players for the Crimson have shown flashes of talent and given glimpses of what the team is capable of. However, while most programs around the league seem to have hit their stride, Harvard still appears to be in the growing phase.
For Harvard, it’s not a question of whether the team has sufficient talent but whether that talent will manifest at opportune times.
“We should be peaking, and we’ve talked about some things and made some adjustments,” Delaney-Smith said. “The process of taking the next step is consistently playing for 40 minutes.”
HARVARD 66, BROWN 63
Heading into Rhode Island after a disappointing defeat to the Bulldogs, Harvard found itself at a loss. After going on a 16-1 run to open the season, the Crimson had gone 3-4, landed at third in Ancient Eight standings, and faced a potential collapse of all the work it put in prior to its in-conference skid.
What was holding Harvard players back? Simply put, themselves.
“We had a meeting last night trying to identify what is the issue,” co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “We just felt a lot of pressure having the 16-0 winning streak. We just wanted to keep winning, which is true, but losing really set us back…. [S]ometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you reach the top of the mountain.”
Still, the Crimson faced a Brown opponent that sat fourth in the Ivy League and had great incentive to come out of the Pizzitola Sports Center with a win.
Not surprisingly, with the lights shining brightest, freshman forward and coveted recruit Jeannie Boehm was the one to get the Crimson to an early lead.
Boehm had led the team in the first quarter with 10 points to push the Crimson to an early 17-15 advantage. The rookie’s dominance forced the Bears to adjust their strategy to focus more on Boehm.
“I thought she did much better—much, much better—[this week],” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s been working on being aggressive and being in attack mode. She’s very coachable, and that showed up.”
Boehm ended the game with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Not only did the freshman forward have an impressive outing, but also the veteran Nunley tallied a double-double on 10 points and 12 rebounds. The Texas native has posted solid statistics the past couple weeks and been a rock that the Crimson can count on.
“When there is adversity and things not going your way, like missed shots or officiating, there are things you can do on the court to keep you in the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “One of those things is being relentless in your rebounding. That is what Destiny has been doing for sure.”
In the fourth quarter, freshman guard Katie Benzan performed like a veteran, scoring 12 of her 24 points then to seal the deal.
“I don’t really think about how many points I score,” Benzan said. “I’m just worried about what my team needs me to do. That’s what is most important to me, and I know it’s the same for my teammates.”
Saturday afternoon’s victory has the Crimson taking a sigh of relief going into its final regular season weekend against top Ivy League opponents Penn and Princeton.
“It’s going to take our best games,” Nunley said. “We had a really tough road trip, and they were games that we were capable of winning. I think we have a lot to prove, and we just need to get rest this week, get our shots up, and need to be as ready as we can for the games.”
YALE 57, HARVARD 52
Falling to Yale for the first time since 2012, the Crimson was out of sorts and could not get out of its own way at Payne Whitney Gymnasium.
In front of a rival crowd, Harvard could not build a substantial lead until late in the game. Due to turnovers and fouls, though, the Crimson would not keep the lead for long and found itself suffering another loss on the road.
“We played tight and had far too many turnovers,” Delaney-Smith said. “It wasn’t because of anything Yale was doing; it was tightness on our part. Turnovers were our demon last night. Many shooters didn’t want the shot.”
The Crimson, who was behind 28-23 at the end of the first half, clawed its way back into the game following a dominant third quarter when it outscored the Bulldogs 18-12. Big play by Benzan and Destiny brought Harvard to a point where it could win the game.
However, a disappointing performance in the fourth quarter derailed the Crimson. Along with three crucial turnovers by Harvard, 11 personal foul calls gave Yale free points at the charity stripe and put the game out of reach.
Junior forward Jen Berkowitz of the Bulldogs matched her season high with 26 points, along with grabbing 10 boards to lead her team to victory.
“It just didn’t have the same feel that we had pre-conference play,” Nunley said. “We kind of lost the fun of it.”
As Harvard regroups after the weekend’s events, the team will get back to the film room and seek to fix outstanding issues. Certainly, the Crimson hopes to have much more dominant games against the two Ancient Eight opponents sitting between it and an Ivy League championship.
“I think the weekend down at Penn and Princeton wasn’t indicative of us as a team,” Benzan said. “We weren’t playing like ourselves…. I think it will be a totally different atmosphere, and I feel really good about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 27, 2017 at 3:48pm
Reaching new heights in its historic climb for greatness, Harvard women’s squash won a third consecutive College Squash Association national championship Sunday afternoon. The 7-2 victory over Penn gave the Crimson its 17th national title, tied for the most in the history of collegiate women’s squash.
As sophomore Kayley Leonard’s drop shot bounced twice in front of her opponent, dreams of number 17 began to crystalize in front of the eyes of the Crimson (15-0, 7-0 Ivy League). The Harrison, N.Y. native was able to snatch five match points from the clutches of No. 3 Penn junior Marie Stephan to bring the closely fought match to a deciding tie breaker. Leonard was able to complete a seven-point run and capture her match as part of a sweep of the first wave in championship play.
Scrappy No. 2 Penn (13-2, 6-1) had come back from a 3-0 deficit in its semifinal bout against Trinity. Stephan held a potential spark for yet another rally but failed to convert one final point to close out a nailbiter match. From that point on, the championship contest was all but a formality for Harvard.
“Kayley Leonard never loses a squash match,” freshman Gina Kennedy said. “That showed today–she’ll fight to the end, and she’s just the best player you can have on the Harvard team.”
The Crimson’s top two women, Kennedy and sophomore Sabrina Sobhy, fell in later matches, but by the time their bouts ended, the tournament final had already been decided. Harvard’s three lowest-ranked athletes provided easy relief from the competitive intensity by winning their matchups in the minimum number of games. It was truly a team effort, and the Crimson valued each one of its victories, no matter where it came from.
Penn’s dramatic edgeding of the Bantams on Saturday afternoon by a 5-4 margin left the team elated yet physically spent. At virtually the same time Penn began its comeback, Harvard had just clinched a berth in the national championship game as part of an 8-1 rout of No. 4 Princeton.
The Crimson’s physical and competitive dominance was apparent. The team maintained essentially the same ladder throughout the tournament, with No. 9 freshman Eleonore Evans filling in for captain Dileas MacGowan one game, and started the quarterfinals with a perfect 9-0 sweep of No. 8 Columbia on Friday without dropping a single game.
“We were able to outlast our opponent, I think both physically, in terms of our fitness, but also just mentally,” MacGowan said. “We were the team, at those critical points, that played them really well. People were able to stick it out, and be more patient than our opponent.”
Not limited to the small details and intangibles, the Crimson will be proud with its more outward accomplishments, as well. Coach Mike Way has tied program history with his fifth championship victory, pulling even with Bill Doyle who won his titles consecutively from 1993-1997.
“Our coaches are unique in the sense that they don’t just focus on the fitness component, the actual shot selection, and practicing on court itself,” MacGowan said. “They make it a priority of working on and getting the team to allocate numbers of hours for mental preparation and visualization.”
Consistency and mental toughness were items constantly stressed by the coaching staff during the regular season. These qualities shined brightly on both the individual and team levels. Leonard’s fifth-game rally may be the most glaring example of the Crimson philosophy in effect. But Harvard players maintained leads and converted points throughout the tournament, each minor shot contributing to the eventual title.
Playing at Princeton’s Jadwin Court, the two Ivy League rivals now have the same amount of championship victories. But one team—Harvard—continues to rise.
With a slice of revenge against Penn, the last team to hand the Crimson a loss, Harvard has pushed its two-year win streak to 38 games. Moreover, the team did not give up more than two matches in a single matchup this entire season, after winning 5-4 in last year’s semifinal and championship matchups.
While the road continues for Harvard squash, it ends for four Crimson seniors. But their journeys could not have had a sweeter conclusion.
MacGowan, captain Caroline Monrad, Katie Tutrone, and Keegan Mendez went an incredible 42-0 on the season.
“This team, especially, has been really united—united from the get-go,” said Kennedy. “We’re all such great friends and that’s mainly because the seniors are just so inclusive, and they are so welcoming, and they make everyone feel at home. It felt like a family straight away.”
The seniors might not being turning professional like Amanda Sobhy ‘16, Sabrina’s sister, but just like the current No. 6 player in the world, they won three national championships. And that is something the 2017 graduates will take with them well beyond their Harvard years.
Meanwhile, the top half of Harvard’s lineup returns for another year of competition, along with a strong supporting cast and new recruits. The numbers suggest more growth and greatness, but only time will tell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Holding onto a three-goal lead with less than four minutes left in the game, Harvard women’s lacrosse failed to prevent a last-minute barrage by Boston College, as the Crimson suffered a come-from-behind loss in Newton, Mass.
Harvard (1-1) saw the Eagles (5-2) finish an overtime comeback victory with a hat-trick, free-position goal by junior attacker Kaileen Hart. The Crimson possessed the lead for the entirety of the game until senior attacker Kate Weeks delivered an unassisted score with just 17 seconds left, sending BC to overtime with great momentum.
“We need to play to win down the stretch,” head coach Lisa Miller said. “I thought we tightened up a bit. Staying composed and in control as the other team tries to alter the pace of play will be important in the future.”
Harvard sprinted out of the gate to a 6-1 lead but gave up two goals in 30 seconds to conclude the last two minutes in the first half.
After allowing another Eagles goal in the opening 1:43 of the second half, the Crimson halted its opponent’s momentum and followed with two scores by junior attacker Eliza Guild and tri-captain midfielder Maeve McMahon to bring Harvard to an 8-4 lead.
However, the back-and-forth continued, with BC answering a three-goal streak by the Crimson with a three-goal response. By then, the score stood at 11-8 after 15 minutes in the second half.
Overall, Harvard finished with 19 shots on goal and 25 total, while the Eagles took 31 shots with 24 on goal.
The oscillating stretches of momentum were manageable for the Crimson given the team’s solid three-to-four point cushion throughout much of the game. But holding onto composure to the end proved to be harder than expected.
“We need to find a way to take some pressure off our midfielders and defenders in the clearing game,” Miller said. “ We need to work on managing the clock and possessing down the stretch.”
Time management proved to be a challenge near the conclusion of the game, as Harvard ended up sitting back and playing too much defense, while allowing Boston College to pile on attack after attack. The Eagles had nearly double the amount of shots in the second half at 18 that they did in the first half. Meanwhile the hosts limited themselves to nine fouls, compared to the Crimson’s foul count of 22 in the second stanza.
This patient yet aggressive performance by Boston College helped to spark a 5-1 run to finish regulation and send the game into overtime. Harvard’s penalties racked up in those final minutes, with three yellow cards issued to the Crimson in the last six and a half minutes.
In overtime, Harvard was unable to garner any offensive firepower and had two turnovers, resulting in a defensive hold for the rest of the game. Junior goalkeeper Meredith Brown blocked two shots on goal by the Eagles during the overtime period, but a ground ball pick-up by Boston College attacker Hart with 2:42 left in overtime resulted in an easy free-position shot on goal.
Brown, who had a career-high 11 saves, could not save a Crimson team that has been 0-2 in overtime performances dating back to 2014.
Despite the end result, Coach Miller noted several excellent performances by her team leaders, including senior midfielder Megan Hennessey, who finished with a goal and two assists, and Guild, who finished with two goals. Sophomore midfielder Keeley McAfee scored a team-high four goals.
“We played hard. A little more composure, and we are in good shape for the league and a potential NCAA tournament berth,” Miller said. “A few mental adjustments turns the game into a win."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Racing against not only a competitive field of skiers but also the melting snow from record-setting heat, the Harvard alpine and nordic ski teams competed in the NCAA Regional Championship hosted by Bates College on Friday and Saturday. The Crimson finished in 11th place out of the 16 EISA teams competing. .
In the alpine giant slalom event, the uncooperative weather caused rapidly deteriorating course conditions that forced the second run of the race to be canceled.
“It was definitely another challenging weekend for the team,” junior Kelly Steeves said. “The weather and snow conditions were far from ideal. It was really warm the entire weekend and this lead to a lot of deterioration on the course.”
Overcoming the challenging conditions, Steeves led the women in the giant slalom, finishing 55th overall. Senior Kaitlyn Gibson was the top slalom finisher, placing 54th.
Freshman Carter Kendig continued to lead the men, finishing his strong first year with a 31st-place finish in the giant slalom. Senior Kalvis Hornburg led the way in slalom, coming in 39th overall.
As a team, Dartmouth continued its alpine dominance, winning its fifth carnival of the season
Meanwhile, on the nordic side, Harvard senior Rachel Hampton and freshman William Rhatigan led the way with a pair of top-25 finishes.
Hampton skied to a 23rd-place finish in the women's 15K FS MS, crossing the finish line in 48:09.3. Sophomore Hannah Hardenbergh was right behind her, finishing with a time 49:22.3, good for 32nd place overall. In the 5K Classic, Hardenbergh led Harvard with a time of 18:10.46, placing in 28th.
Freshman Tegan Thorley also recorded strong finishes in both nordic events, crossing the finish in 35th place for the 5K and 39th for the 15K.
Only a freshman, Rhatigan impressed with a 22nd-place finish in the men’s 20K FS MS, competing the course in 54:54.3. He also took home 36th in the 10K, just after teammate senior Ian Meyer, who was 35th.
“We were skiing in the rain for most of the day Saturday but we had a good showing even though the conditions were not ideal,” Steeves said. “It was not the nicest day for our seniors’ last race, but everyone made the best of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tied 5-5 early in the fourth quarter against No. 10 Princeton, Harvard women’s water polo had a chance to achieve a signature win early in the season. Instead, the No. 19 Crimson (4-2) failed to keep pace with the undefeated Tigers, ultimately falling 7-6.
“Although this past weekend didn't result in a win, we showed that we can compete with Princeton,” sophomore Kristen Hong said. “We made a couple of mistakes that led to our...loss. Yet we are very happy with our performance this past weekend and still have so much room for improvement.”
At Denunzio Pool on Saturday morning, Princeton (7-0) opened the game with two quick goals, immediately showing its offensive strength. Throughout the second quarter, however, junior goaltender Cleo Harrington made multiple saves to keep Harvard in contention for a top-10 upset.
The first Crimson goal of the game came from senior Michelle Martinelli, which Princeton answered right away with an opposing score. Still, freshman Julie Harrison helped Harvard re-close the score gap, bringing the halftime score to 3-2.
Coming out strong in the second half, Hong responded to a Princeton goal with a quick shot off a pass from Martinelli. In this way, Hong extending her goal total on the season to 12.
With two minutes left in the third quarter, sophomore Haley Bowe scored to tie the game at 4-4, but Princeton quickly reciprocated when a bounce off the crossbar landed in the net. That finish meant that the third quarter ended with the Tigers clinging to a 5-4 advantage.
Freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz opened the final quarter with a goal that re-tied the score at 5-5. A defensive battle between the two teams lasted for most of the remaining frame. The netminder Harrington tallied 11 stops and two steals throughout the game.
With only three minutes left to go in the game, Princeton scored twice to take a 7-5 lead. Harvard made a final offensive push with Martinelli finding the back of the net one last time with  under a minute of play remaining. However, her goals was not enough to pull of the upset.
However exhausting the close defeat proved, the Crimson has a chance at redemption next weekend in a rematch with the Tigers. Already, the prospect seemed to energize Hong.
“We are extremely excited to get another shot at Princeton this Friday at our home pool, Blodgett,” the sophomore said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (5-6, 3-3 EIVA) continued an up-and-down season with a devastating loss followed by a decisive win. The defeat came against Princeton (6-7, 4-2 EIVA) on Friday night, while the victory came the next day against NJIT (7-7, 3-3 EIVA).
“To come back from a really tough loss on Friday against one of our biggest rivals and play the way we did Saturday is a huge confidence boost,” Baise said. “[The weekend] tells us that we can play at that high level.”
HARVARD 3, NJIT 0
On Saturday night, the Crimson hosted NJIT for both teams’ sixth conference match of the season. Despite a five-set loss the night before, Harvard walked into the gym with perceptible energy.
The final result reflected that initial exuberance, as the Crimson powered to a 3-0 win.
In the third set, the Highlanders took a 14-13 scoreline, broaching the possibility of a comeback. But Harvard proceeded to open a gap and claim a 25-18 win.
“We’ve had a lot of close sets and haven’t won as many as we’d like we,” coach Brian Baise said. “We’ve been better these last two weekends. We changed, the weekend before last, the offense and lineup. The guys are playing with more confidence.”
The first set was a tense match of will and skill as NJIT and Harvard were neck and neck throughout the 25-point frame. Freshman outside hitter Erik Johnsson stood out in the set with five total kills.
The Crimson initially rushed to a 6-3 lead in the first, but the Highlanders fought to a two-point margin until captain and outside hitter Casey White led the hosts to a 15-9 lead.
The second set also looked promising for NJIT as the visitors started the set with a lead. In this case, though, Harvard roared back for a 16-16 deadlock.
Despite Crimson errors that furthered the Highlanders’ lead, sophomore middle blocker Trevor Dow brought Harvard back to a 21-20 deficit with two kills. Then, after taking advantage of NJIT errors, Harvard rebounded and won the tense set, 25-23, after a White kill.
“I think the key for those [pressurized’ points is staying focused on each point one at a time and not thinking too much about winning the set or the match,” said captain and libero Samuel Murphy. “We definitely play our best when we're focused in the moment, playing with energy and confidence.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 2
After hours of depressing and then uplifting play for Harvard, the fifth set opened with hope.
In the third and fourth set, the Crimson had claimed must-win points to force a final tiebreak. Now confidence and energy ran high as the team prepared for the do-or-die game.
“Drive and motivation has never been a problem for this team,” Baise said. “It’s a bunch of competitive guys who really take pride in what they do…. We’ve been in the playoffs five years in a row and really want that streak to continue.”
At the end of the night, though, the Crimson was unable to stage a game-winning comeback. Despite building an early lead in that final set, Harvard fell, 15-10, to drop the fifth-set marathon.
The close competition began in the first set, when Harvard and Princeton battled back-and-forth. The Tigers gained a 17-15 lead after two strong blocks and went on to win the first set, 25-20.
During the second set, even though White and junior middle blocker Riley Moore each had three kills, the Crimson lost momentum, posting ten kills but two service errors.
However, the third set changed everything. Harvard quickly gained a 9-5 lead to put pressure on the Tigers. Freshman setter Matthew Cvrtlik stood out with one kill and three assists. As the set drew to an end, the Crimson hung tough, claiming a 25-20 victory to force the evening to a fourth set.
In that fourth frame, Harvard bolted to a lead, holding a five-point advantage until the end of the set. Momentum propelled Harvard, as the players began to pull off tough shots in key points. Late in the fourth, for example, Moore landed a backhand strike to win a point for the Crimson. Set four came to an emphatic end as White had a sideline kill to earn the 25-17 win.
“I think we knew in both of those first two sets that we were playing fairly well,” Murphy said. “We just weren't able to close them out at the end. So in the third and fourth sets, we brought the same focus we had in the first two sets and increased our energy to rally back and win those next two.”

Facebook is full of viral phenomena, most common among them being the meme. As the famous saying goes “all roads lead to Harvard” or maybe they lead to Rome and we're just a little bit too self-aggrandizing to leave it at that. Anyway, the meme craze has stuck Harvard with full force in the form of the new highly popular Facebook Group “Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens.” No, we’re not going to add you. Haven’t you heard of exclusive social spaces?
Since it’s creation on Feb. 4, the group has expanded to over 2500 members—mostly Harvard students, but with the occasional Yale peeper infiltrating the ranks. There are some pretty dope memes on the page, poking fun at anything from some of Harvard's more vexing policies to downright bizarre pictures of Dean Khurana’s face superimposed over random images. Last week, Flyby sat down with the group’s creator, Rebecca Chen ’20 to discuss the page's origins and increasing popularity.


How did you get the idea to start the page?
I have always wanted to start a meme group. After seeing UCLA and UC Berkeley's meme groups, I thought Harvard needed one too so I took the step for all of us.
She’s not quite the hero we needed, but definitely the hero we deserve. 
What did you expect it to become?
I expected it to be big. These [memes] are really relatable and really funny. Since other meme groups took off, I thought one for a college like us would too.
Why can’t a Harvard student ever do something and expect it to just be average? 
What was the first meme you posted on the page?
I had a stream of memes. I made about 5 memes just to get some pictures out there. I do know that the most popular one is the lamont one.


How did you get the word out about the page?
I added a lot of my friends first, about 100. And they added a few friends and I kept posting quality, original memes and then other people caught on.
Do we detect a mere hint of shade being thrown here? 
What’s your favorite meme?
My favorite memes are the ones I’ve posten posted, I’m sorry.
*ahem* how humble *ahem*
Definitely the Lamont one is among the top memes. I also really like my “exploited labor of the working class” memes. I like all the memes that are put on there.


Aww shucks, you’re not bad yourself.
Are there any memes that you don't like?
I appreciate all memes. When people repost memes I don’t like—those, I delete. When people share links I usually delete those too. Ones that don’t relate to us, I delete. I also delete posts from Yale Students
What do you mean by Yale students? 
If the posts are from Yale students making fun of Harvard, I delete them. But if they post a nice, fun, and original Harvard meme, I’ll let it stay on. I’m not biased.
If there were one meme you could show to President Faust or Dean Khurana, which would it be and why?
That’s hard. You can’t embody Harvard in one meme. If we were going by number of likes, the lamont one has the most likes. I don’t know if Drew Faust would understand that one.
There are also a few about the snow days and FAS being open during snow days [that I would show her]. There are also lots about CS51—seems to be a popular trend in the group. 


Have people started to recognize you as “the Harvard Meme Girl”
Recognize no, but when I say my name, yes.
How do you feel about that?
I love it, I love it. I absolutely love the attention, it’s my 15-second claim to fame!
Anything else?
I just want people to know that this is a group for us, it’s for everyone, it’s inclusive. It’s for relatable diversity, and lots of good stuff.

Not all superheroes wear capes. One of our own Harvard superhero wears an Annenberg apron and a name-tag that reads: “John.” When the p-set woes have got you down and you finally decide to treat yourself to a much-needed Berg break, who else could brighten your day like trusty John S. Martin? We headed over to the Berg to get the scoop on the man behind the smile. Here's what we found out:
For seven years, John has been welcoming hungry Harvard freshmen at the Annenberg, and at Leverett House for the previous six.
What's your favorite part of the job?
"That's easy—you guys".
How do you remember names so quickly?
“It comes naturally. If I don’t remember their name, I’ll remember their last name, or that they’re from Chicago, or what sport they play. I do it to make myself feel comfortable, and to make you guys feel comfortable.”
What is your trick to help a freshman having a bad day?
"I like to come up with something cheesy like “Smiles are free today!” because everyone would rather laugh than cry, right?"
What is your least favorite part of the job?
“Definitely tourists. It’s just really frustrating because there are signs outside in like 6 different languages. It also poses a security threat. There should be security guards here. Sometimes you guys, students, don’t feel safe. Some days I wish I had a taser.”
Any last advice?
“Treat other people the way you wanna be treated, right? You can tell who’s having a bad day.”
So next time you come across someone who seems down, think to yourself, “WWJD: What Would John Do?”
