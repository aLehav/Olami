After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot has changed since Claire Cottrill (known professionally as Clairo) last performed in Boston in 2019 — the pandemic being only one of them. Following the widespread acclaim of her 2019 debut album “Immunity” and world tour that came with it, the Carlisle-native moved back to her home state of Massachusetts and rescued a dog, Joanie. By 2021, she had released into the world her sophomore effort and most ambitious project to date: the devastatingly calibrated, ’70s folk-inspired monument to vulnerability that is “Sling.”
On Feb. 27 and 28, Clairo once again had a homecoming, playing two sold-out shows at Boston’s House of Blues with supporting act British poet-singer Arlo Parks. “I’m so excited to be here,” Clairo told the audience at her Feb. 27 show, recounting her childhood spent just outside of Boston. “This just means the world to me. I went to so many shows in this venue.”
Ever since its release, “Sling” has been celebrated by critics as a testament to Clairo’s “maturity,”and indeed that is part of its strength. (The sleek peacoat she wore on stage this time around was a definite shift from the comfy sweats she donned in 2019.) But the album, which made up the bulk of Clairo’s twenty-song set, is perhaps more notable for how natural a progression it feels for the artist. Despite being radically different from “Immunity” and older mega-hits like “Pretty Girl” in terms of its production, “Sling” shows Clairo coming into her own. As she told Vogue’s Keaton Bell back in 2021, “‘Sling’ is moreso the direction I’ve dreamt of making music in and the kind of headspace I wanna continue down…. that feels really exciting because that means I’ve found something that works for me.”
On stage at the House of Blues, Clairo used this to her advantage. Backed by a six-piece band, an array of sculptural light fixtures, and surrealist animations projected onto the screen behind her, the singer-songwriter gave her audience a performance that felt intimately her own. She kicked off the show at the piano with “Bambi.” “I’m stepping inside a universe designed against my own beliefs / They’re toying with me and tapping their feet,” she sang, introducing the (patriarchal) systems and structures that “Sling” pushes against. All the while, her voice was cushioned and uplifted by a swelling chorus of plush electric guitars, and an audience ready to belt every single word. Just as Clairo’s sound and lyrical subject matter have grown and matured, so have her fans. They knew the words to every single song as if it were their own.
Songs like “Zinnias,” with its refreshingly danceable guitar riffs, and “Alewife” with its overwhelming tenderness — both of which Clairo played on her forest-green guitar — proved standouts in a set overflowing with loving renditions of super-hits and more stripped back tracks alike. Carefully contrasted with songs from “Sling'' like the confessional “Partridge” and the disarmingly cutting “Blouse,” even Clairo’s most popular and shimmering anthems from her bedroom-pop era were made to feel at home in the cozy, lounge-inspired setting. “Immunity”’s “Softly,” for example, was given extra room to breathe with a more expansive and jazzy arrangement that allowed Clairo’s vocals to take center stage.
“Alright Boston, do you know the words?” the 23-year old singer said before breaking out into “Bags,” its upbeat melody filling the venue as she sang about struggling to open up about her feelings for a girl. A saxophone solo towards the end kept the song firmly grounded in the energy of the night. Clairo then wasted no time going into “Harbor,” a song about moving on from a relationship that is no longer working, its melody so soft and delicate with its acoustic guitars and ethereal harmonies that it threatens breaking. This balance — between guardedness and vulnerability, between sparkling pop arrangements and low-key piano ballads — kept the night afloat, proving Clairo has never needed to sacrifice one era of her career for the next. Indeed, the fact that she’s still sure to play 2017’s “Pretty Girl” at every show only further solidifies this fact.
Despite the bigger size of the venue, Clairo took the time to interact with her eager audience, too. “I wrote this song about my dog Joanie. What a great dog,” she said before playing the instrumental track named after her pet. “So if you have a dog, I want you to think about your dog…. Think about how great your dog is… And let’s just sit, and think.” During “Blouse,” she invited the crowd to sing with her. “Asshole!” people yelled about the song’s subject. To which she responded, quietly, “period.” “Sing with me?” she asked, over and over. And so the crowd did.
By the time they closed out the show with the groovy “Amoeba” and “Management,” Clairo and her band had taken their audience on a wholly immersive journey into the depths of her constantly evolving musical artistry. Her encore, an updated and elevated rendition of the wildly popular “Sofia,” brought the house down. “This has just been like the best night ever, so I really appreciate you coming out,” she said before exiting the stage, bringing the night’s retreat to ’70s jazz clubs and woodsy hideaways to a loving end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How do you go on a national headlining tour when only five of your songs are publicly out in the world? That was among one of two questions indie breakout band Wet Leg attempted to answer with their Mar. 7 show at Boston’s Paradise Rock Club. The other: If you do go on tour, how do you keep an audience entertained when over two-thirds of the songs on the setlist are ones they’ve never heard before? Especially in this day and age, when the prohibitive financial costs (and still-tangible pandemic risks) of many concerts means that often only the biggest fans come out to any given show, these questions loomed large. But despite their currently limited catalog of released music, Wet Leg put on a refreshingly dynamic and candid show. It’s no surprise the British indie duo currently ranks among the most exciting and buzziest bands out there.
The band is composed of guitarists and vocalists Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers, two friends from the Isle of Wight, bassist Ellis Durand, drummer Henry Holmes, and Joshua Omead Mobaraki on synths.They came to prominence in 2021 with their single “Chaise Longue,” a guitar-driven tongue-in-cheek tune that quickly went viral, garnering millions of streams within a single summer. Since then, they’ve quickly come into their own with a signature style that features sly and quirky lyrics with a deadpan delivery, post-punk sensitivities, and a refusal to stick to any one genre. As Chambers told Guitar World in January of this year, “From the beginning we didn’t want to put any boundaries on the music that we were making.” Their repertoire so far proves that.
In an interview with NME in the fall of 2021, the duo said they created Wet Leg because they “wanted to have more fun than every other single band.” Teasdale and Chambers made that decision back in 2019 from the top of a ferris wheel. Seeing them perform at the Paradise three years later, electric guitars in tow, it’s clear they’ve made good on their promise. The chemistry between the pair is endearing, with knowing glances and covert smiles sprinkled throughout the set. During the rolling, synth-filled intro of “Too Late Now” (one of the more recent singles off their forthcoming debut album), for example, Chambers and Teasdale treated their audience to synchronized spinning. With only that minimal and seemingly effortless choreography, their desire to simply “have more fun” was on full display.
The set began with “Being in Love,” a thumping, shoegaze-inspired song that showcased Wet Leg doing what they do best: pairing muted, minimal verses with exploding and shimmering guitar riffs so powerful they fill the venue. Indeed, this became a theme throughout the show. With new tracks like the confessional “Obvious” and the high-energy banger “Supermarket,” the show was restless in its dynamism. Maintaining a balance of post-punk and more folksy songs, the band gave themselves — and their audience — room to explore what Wet Leg is and can become. In an exceptionally strong set, unreleased songs like “Ur Mum,” “Loving You,” and “It’s Not Fun” are ones to keep an especially eager ear out for once the band’s album arrives. And of course, their humorously cutting breakup song and sophomore single “Wet Dream” was among the absolute highlights of the night, a point where the band really came into their own.
Teasdale and Chambers, it must be said, are powerhouses in their respective domains. While Teasdale belts away, keeping the crowd captivated with her snarky lyrics and cool girl charm, Chambers is a force on her guitar. Though Wet Leg’s music isn’t built on in-your-face power chords or soaring guitar solos, it’s still the guitars that make the songs truly stand out — not least because of the innovative ways in which the duo write. Chambers and Teasdale, who learned to play guitar in order to write music for Wet Leg, bring a refreshing perspective to the instrument with their signature sound. It’s that willingness to explore that makes their set so captivating as the duo shapeshift, changing their sound ever so slightly to accommodate for the range in their songwriting.
By the time Teasdale, Chambers, and their band arrived at the long-awaited “Chaise Longue” (preceded by their latest single “Angelica”), they had a new army of devotees at their feet. Watching Wet Leg is like being let in on a secret, and their Paradise Rock Club performance made it clear that, with their ’80s influences and unapologetic style, they’re a band everyone should be paying attention to. With such a captivating performance, they proved fans made the right choice by trusting them enough to see a show full of surprises. They made sure their audience left reinvigorated knowing they were there for the music (even if they didn’t know all of it just yet).
Wet Leg’s debut self-titled album will be released on April 8.
