After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A master conductor can guide a symphony to reach its full potential. An electrifying soloist can compensate for uninspired programming. But a lack of cohesion can weaken even the strongest of ensembles. Though the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) aimed for a nontraditional approach by presenting two classical violin concertos with the soloist doubling as conductor and only half of the orchestra on stage, their vision was not fully realized. Soloist Anne-Sophie Mutter’s interpretations of the featured Mozart Violin Concertos No.s 3 and 5 were refined and tasteful, but even her considerable star power could not mask the reduced capacity of an orchestra suffering from the resignation of longtime music director James Levine.
The program opened with the Mozart Violin Concerto No. 3 in G Major, a perennial crowd-pleaser infused with melodic sentiment and effortless charm. As the lightly orchestrated score required the accompaniment of only a fraction of the BSO’s musicians, Mutter delivered the piece’s regal thematic entrance from the center of a sparsely populated stage. Mutter chose not to wax virtuosic, and appropriately so: the violinist alternated the impeccable articulation of Mozart’s signature running passages with creatively segmented melodic lines that carried across Symphony Hall without excessive belting.
The ensemble added enough accompanying substance to fill out Mutter’s lead, but it offered none of its usual playful and even coy charm. Mutter provided the fanfare for her own cadenza with a double stop series that dug confidently but not aggressively into the meat of themes introduced earlier in the piece. The nuanced phrasing of the second movement sustained a bucolic line but transitioned roughly into a lagging third movement. Where Mutter moved nimbly from a jaunting allegro into a stately vivace, the ensemble followed along halfheartedly. This weakness may have been less reflective of the players’ abilities than it was of the minimal leadership Mutter provided as a conductor.
The second and final piece, Mozart’s Violin Concerto No. 5 in A Major, closely paralleled No. 3 in construction, style, and execution.  Mozart’s Fifth is perhaps a bit more pensive than the Third, and Mutter took care to add an extra dose of subtlety to her phrasing and a bit more continuity to her transitions. The ensemble delivered a flat accompaniment that accelerated in musical character only near the piece’s spirited conclusion. Pairing the Third and the Fifth was an unconventional choice to open the season—presenting Mozart’s work at its most nuanced, colorful, and graceful at the cost of showcasing the orchestra’s versatility.  Though such loss of versatility is inevitable in an all-Mozart program, the ensemble’s distinctions between the Third and Fifth were perhaps a bit understated in performance. Mutter and the ensemble were met with a warm reception but offered no encore: it left this reviewer—and others who would argue that Opening Night at the BSO has historically been one of the most versatile concerts of the season—wondering about an unusual programming decision that did not afford the orchestra the opportunity to display its full range of talents. It is undeniable that the BSO attracts world-class soloists and guest conductors to Symphony Hall, but the distinctly directionless Opening Night—despite many artistically redeeming moments—indicates that the orchestra is in need of fresh leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten performed at the Harvard Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH) for the kickoff event honoring Harvard’s Dating Violence Awareness month. Her concert and the following discussion—focused on sexual violence and abusive relationships—was sponsored by The Radcliffe Union of Students (RUS) and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR). Van Etten recently signed with the label “Jagjaguwar” and will be releasing a new album early next year.
The Harvard Crimson: What inspired you to take part in this kickoff event and offer a free concert?
Sharon Van Etten: I think there is a lack of an open dialogue about [dating violence] and it is important that [this dialogue] does not come from a professional. If it comes from a person that is more of a professional than [women in abusive relationships], they may not relate to it as well as someone who is closer to their age.
THC: What is the take-away message that you hope to give your listeners with your Saturday performance?
SVE: Really know yourself and trust that if [your relationship] does not feel right to you—or if you are not being treated well—you are right. It is really hard to be strong when you fall in love with somebody but [I think] being true to yourself is the most important message that I could ever tell anybody.
THC: The last song on your most recent album “Because I Was In Love” describes an abusive relationship. What inspired these lyrics?
SVE: I wrote it about a serious relationship that I was in with someone who wasn’t nurturing at all … It was teetering on the edge of being abusive and I had to walk away. It was because I had really strong female friends that I was able to walk away. It really helps to have support at the end of your relationship. You can do it yourself but [friends] are the people who see that you may be in an unhealthy relationship.
THC: How is your songwriting motivated by your experiences?
SVE: My writing is a sort of therapy for me … I record myself and then I go back and look through the memos that I record and I edit in hindsight. I try to adjust what it was I was going through [to the point] where the music is not overly personal because it is really important that people are able to relate to it. It is quite an exercise.
THC: Do you see a role for musicians as social commentators?
SVE: I think certain writers do [incorporate social commentary] but I think it is also important to have different forms of music, some that are just fun. [Music] is also a way to get new perspectives on things and to write about different media, whether it be social or political or religious. Songs don’t have to be about anything serious either.
THC: There have recently been several songs about abusive relationships released by well-recognized artists—one being the Eminem and Rihanna collaboration “Love the Way You Lie.” Do you think popular musicians are more openly acknowledging abusive relationships?
SVE: Though I feel that there are many stronger women coming into the forefront of the music world with their stories, I still feel like there remains a disconnect [between these advances] and the treatment of women in the media. Seeing singers like Beyoncé—who is one of the strongest feminist figures in that mainstream world—is an indicator that things are starting to change, but I still feel like a lot of things need to improve.

An exotic hum resonated in Sanders Theatre last Tuesday, September 27. The piercing sound of Galician bagpipes enveloped the hall as the lilting melodies of violins began to weave the melody of “River Suite”—and the newest collaboration of The Silk Road Ensemble commenced.
Led by award-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, the musicians of The Silk Road Ensemble participated in a week-long residency that started on September 22 and culminated in a final free performance at New College Theatre last Wednesday. Joining forces with Harvard for a five-year collaboration, The Silk Road Project—Ma’s nonprofit arts and educational organization—not only promotes communication between cultures, but also presents music as a way for education and cultural entrepreneurship. The Silk Road Ensemble,  Ma’s collective of internationally renowned performers and composers from more than 20 countries, presents innovative performances as part of the Project’s larger mission.
Last week’s performances were no exception to the Silk Road Ensemble’s creativity. Last Monday, the Silk Road musicians surprised passersby at the Spangler Center at the Harvard Business School. With the goal of animating the environment, the ensemble began playing Brazilian samba whistles, which imitate bird calls, in the campus courtyard before presenting an impromptu performance in the Spangler Center before an excited crowd.
The ensemble’s decision to play at the Harvard Business School elaborates on the idea of interdisciplinary learning—and the entrepreneurship that can be inspired by the cross-pollination of different academic fields. Rather than limiting music to the sphere of the concert hall, the Silk Road Project works to unite its music together with other disciplines to create a stronger artistic experience.
“We think about entrepreneurship as being something that is more related to economics [and] business,” said Kojiro Umezaki, who plays the shakuhachi—a Japanese end-blown flute—for the ensemble. “But we feel there is also value—maybe value that you cannot monetize as easily—[in] actually growing [an] original idea within the cultural domain.”
In addition to presenting their own work, the Silk Road Project brought an educational perspective in their collaboration with Harvard’s student musicians. In last week’s most recent collaboration, Harvard students participated in the Silk Road Project by arranging, performing, and working with the ensemble. Challenged with only 24 hours to prepare, three selected freshman were asked to arrange works that were eventually performed by the ensemble in last Tuesday’s Sanders Theatre concert. Several other student performers were given the opportunity to participate in an improvisation session with the ensemble’s musicians in a showcase at the New College Theatre the following day.
“They taught me how to work outside the box,” said Stella F. Chen ’15, a violinist who participated in the Silk Road Ensemble’s improvisation sessions. “They would play Bach and Mozart, just our kind of music. [But] then we would go to the stage [and] they would start putting the bow behind the strings and snap-pitzing [an abbreviated term for pizzicato, or the plucking of strings].”
In addition to improvisational techniques, students were also given the opportunity to explore non-traditional musical influences. “This is a new direction of developing music because we are now applying non-Western traditions to Western music and Western traditions to non-Western music,” said Bran S. Shim ’14, a participating bass player.
Shim shares the Silk Road’s aspiration to extend the potential of musical collaboration. “We can use music as a device not only to communicate with each other, but [also to] develop the international community. It becomes a tool.” In this respect, the value of The Silk Road Ensemble’s musicianship—and their multifaceted education—becomes clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last August 11, the second episode of the fourth season of “Jersey Shore” and a GOP debate were aired at exactly the same time. Drama between Michele Bachmann and Mitt Romney proved less compelling to the U.S. than that between Snooki and Pauly D; “Jersey Shore” received almost 2.5 million more viewers. It was the 35th episode of “Jersey Shore” and only the third Republican debate.
“Jersey Shore” has been critiqued on moral, aesthetic, social and spiritual registers. It’s even been denounced for glorifying tanning. While critical analyses of the show are worthwhile, however, there is also a sociological perspective that doesn’t question the reality show’s meaning for viewers. Rather than deriding its importance, this viewpoint seeks simply to analyze what the popularity of “Jersey Shore” may imply about the culture surrounding it. If an alien landed on earth and saw “Jersey Shore,” what would he learn about Americans?
An emergence of classes at Harvardthat focus on popular TV shows has sparked intelligent discussions about the social norms evident in any TV rendering of society. The professors and students who now use TV as an academic tool seek to prove that the medium provides instant access into the sensibilities of both small subcultures and whole countries. The normative claims to be made about whether “Jersey Shore” should beat out a presidential debate are less interesting to this school of thought than the way the show reflects on our culture at large.
TELEVISION TO SCIENCE
Thankfully, there are shows that say something about America other than “Jersey Shore.” Sam G. Greenberg ’14 may be anomalous among college students who use Hulu and Netflix to procrastinate. “I watch very little TV at Harvard, but I don’t really watch much TV in general,” he says. However, as a prospective History and Literature concentrator, Greenberg believes television is uniquely able to preserve and exhibit elements of a culture.
“For me, television is always a reflection of cultural values and I find it interesting,” Greenberg says. “The only thing I’ve been watching recently is ‘Entourage,’ and the show started eight years ago so it’s fascinating to see the small indications of how society has changed since then. From the clothes they wear to the updates in technology that are portrayed in the show, it’s cool to see how popular culture has changed in the past few years.” “Entourage” does not seek to portray something about American culture, but simply by virtue of its commitment to realism—a commitment it shares with all sitcoms—facts about American culture are subtly woven into the script.
Other shows have higher aspirations for the accuracy and weight of their societal depictions. Lewis and Linda Geyser University Professor William Julius Wilson teaches the now-famous class African and African American Studies 115: “HBO’s ‘The Wire’ and it Contribution to Understanding Urban Inequality.” “The Wire” follows the members of the underground drug trade in Baltimore, Md., as well as the police forces that work to bring them down. Wilson uses the series to teach a seminar about the urban poor. He assigns his students several episodes to watch each week alongside scholarly articles to read. “‘The Wire’ is such a sophisticated show that every episode, every season, can be related to actual empirical research. I think the students learn even more than those who are just reading academic work,” Wilson says.
Wilson recently met with the creator of “The Wire,” David Simon, and he insists that Simon knows a great deal more about the workings of intercity inequality than many critics give him credit for. “He has a real sociological imagination,” Wilson says. “He has an understanding of the way the world works that reminds me of a person trained in social science.” It is Simon’s relation to academic­—his apparent similarity to a “social scientist”—that legitimizes his show for academic study.
When other academics groused about Wilson’s idea for a class based on a television show, he sent them his proposed syllabus. “I had no one come back with a critical remark after they saw the syllabus,” he says. Criticism, then, came more from preconceptions about TV as intrinsically cheap entertainment than about its television’s actual usefulness in a classroom setting.
“‘The Wire’ doesn’t replace rigorous academic scholarship of these issues, but it does serve as a thread to pool together these various problems that plague the intercity in a way that students can understand,” Wilson explains. “They make these issues accessible to a broader audience.” Television’s academic utility is twofold: it synthesizes diverse subject matter and provides easy access for people accustomed to tuning in. It captures the essence of a particular culture in a way viewers can and want to understand.
In his free time, Wilson reads for pleasure and watches the occasional movie, but rarely watches television. In person, he is reserved and chooses his words wisely. He advocates for the use of TV as a learning tool without using the medium as a diversion for himself. Television cannot take the place of reading and research, but it can make his students appreciate the lives of the urban poor.
LIVING FICTIONS
Television’s possibilities in the classroom are not limited to teaching about sociological issues in America. Preceptor in Slavic Languages and Literatures Natalia Pokrovsky uses the censorship of TV in Russia in order to teach students in Slavic 112: “Advanced Russian: Russian Press and Television” about Russian culture. “The whole news [in Russia], at least 50 percent is artificial,” she says. “It’s posing before the cameras, that’s all.”
According to Pokrovsky, only about 20 percent of the people currently living in most areas of Russia have access to the internet the way Americans do; even in more developed urban areas, the number is still as low as 30 to 35 percent. Thus television is by far the most popular form of media, even though Pokrovsky says that there are only two prominent channels: a general program that features shows about politics and professional sports, much like news channels in the United States, and a government channel, which the professor calls a “total fiction.”
According to Pokrovsky, “The government is brainwashing its citizens.” The state creates an alternate reality that can be used to mollify and rally Russians. The best way to understand the mindset of the average Russian may not therefore be through an analysis of their actual circumstances—economically, politically, culturally—but through the imaginary universe propagated by their cable network.
Aside from its educational value in her classroom, television provides an escape for Pokrovsky outside of academia. “This is how I regain my sanity,” she says laughing. Some of her favorite shows include “Mad Men,” “The Good Wife,” and any version of “Law and Order.” She watches the programs to relax and be entertained, and she believes that television carries an unwarranted stigma in serious circles. Pokrovsky advocates “responsible television,” which she differentiates from the standard mode of viewing.
BEYOND VEGGING
The impetus to make TV fit academic purposes also functions to revivify the act of watching TV. Visiting Lecturer Maria San Filippo, who works on the faculty at both Harvard University Summer School and Wellesley College, teaches a course called SWGS S-1240: “Women and Television” at the Summer School and “American Television, Culture, & Society” at Wellesley. San Fillipo has a deep belief in TV’s potential.
“By simple fact of its cultural ubiquity and influence, TV deserves our media-literate attention,” she wrote in an email. “Because nearly every student encounters television frequently outside of the classroom, class time serves as an academic version of the office water cooler—the space where we convene to discuss our respective perspectives on everything we’re learning in and about viewing.” The mere fact that we all watch TV is sufficient to justify a critical take on its intrinsic and social meaning.
For San Filippo, the structural limitations intrinsic to TV do not prevent an academic from taking TV seriously. “As someone who also teaches courses on film and literature, I find that television has the advantage of being episodic but the disadvantage of being serial,” she wrote. “Time-wise, it’s easier to view and discuss a TV episode than to screen a film or read a novel, but it’s not ideal that we must contemplate those episodes in isolation.” Serialization, which facilitates fandom for certain shows and therefore profits networks, hinders TV’s pedagogical usefulness, whereas its brevity, another commercial consideration, makes it easier to analyze. In this respect, TV shows’ identity as consumer products is not necessarily a bad thing for academic study.
San Filippo wants her students to realize that television viewing doesn’t have to involve vegging out on the couch and staring at the boob-tube with their mouths open and drool slowly pouring out. “When students tell me that they’ll never watch TV the same way again, I feel I’ve done my job,” Filippo wrote.
“Television studies is still working to achieve the degree of legitimacy that film studies struggled to achieve before it, and that various forms of digital media are also now seeking,” San Filippo wrote. In our country’s history, television has been a form of entertainment, a reason to sit down with loved ones and enjoy a show together, a persistent white noise—but rarely an educational tool.
Much of what makes TV fun—that it may be the most effective way to freeze a specific place and time—may also make it academically efficient. Indeed, TV is a snapshot of whatever cultural moment that produces it. So perhaps now is a good time to propose the independent study, History of American Civilization 259: “‘Jersey Shore’ and its Contributions to the Understanding of Italian-American Young Adults in the Tri-State Area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When someone is acting heartlessly, we say, ‘Your blood is blue.’ And then we normally add, ‘Like the Jews.’” The other students chuckled and some glanced in my direction, waiting for my response or perhaps my permission. I laughed. After all, this language lesson’s bigotry was very tame compared to other conversations I had had in Jordan. One of my parents is Jewish, and my Jewish identity has always been light, but for those Americans and Arabs I discussed my heritage with, I might as well have been wearing payots, tzitzis, and a star of David skullcap.
After all, I was a demon, of sorts. Belief of my damning existence was everywhere, but I was definitely not supposed to actually be there. In Jordan, every day and nearly every facet of society was a reminder that I was dirty—the very embodiment of an “Other.” A whole genre of anti-Semitic “history” and literature mocked me in every bookshop, a whole field of anti-Semitic media from historical documentaries to music videos followed me on every television, and an interpretation of Islam that demonizes Judaism frequently bewildered me in conversations.
I heard and overheard countless anti-Semitic remarks in the summers I have spent in Egypt and Jordan. In my experience, arguments about politics almost inevitably turned to “those Jews,” and conspiracy theories wafted comfortably through a room like cigarette smoke. It was suffocating.
I anticipated encountering anti-Semitism, but I expected it to be avoidable. I could not anticipate, nor could I have truly imagined, its systemic nature.
According to a Pew Poll released in July of this year, Muslims throughout the Arab World hold remarkably and consistently negative views on Jews. The favorability ratings of Jews in the Arab World (and its important periphery, i.e. Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan) range between one and five percent. A necessary caveat, of course, is that a question such as: “Do you hold a favorable, neutral, or unfavorable of x group?” does not provide data that can necessarily be categorized as bigotry. On the other hand, this poll in conjunction with an understanding of the role of Israel—rarely distinguished from “Jews”—in contemporary Middle Eastern thought reveals a region mired in rigid anti-Semitism.
Too often we forget that nearly 850,000 Jews from regions as far from Palestine as Morocco, Yemen, and Iran fled or were expelled—often brutally and without property—from their historical lands following Israel’s creation in 1948. The emergence of Israel coincided with the existential political rebirth of the Arab world. For those countries neighboring Israel in particular, hatred of Israel earned the legitimacy of the state, and anti-Semitism became an accepted, government-sanctioned ideology in a sea of ideologies barred by oppressive states.
The exaggerated attention given to Israel, particularly in the form of conspiracy theories, remains the clearest evidence of anti-Semitism. Take, for instance, the popularity of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” a fraudulent treatise—originally of Russian origin—all about the pending Jewish plans for world domination. It is Harry Potter for skinheads. According to research conducted by the famed Princeton historian Bernard Lewis in “Semites and Anti-Semites,” former Arab leaders like King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, President Sadat of Egypt, President Nasser of Egypt, and President Arif of Iraq all read “The Protocols” as historical truth. Of course, it is difficult to gauge the popularity of these anti-Semitic books and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories among the general public. However, consider that in no state in the Arab world do even 30 percent of the people believe Arabs were involved in 9/11. I harbor no doubts that the popularity of conspiracy theories about Jews is similarly popular.
Evidence that anti-Semitism remains a provocative force in the Middle East abounds today, as it did before. Western pundits recognize the cynicism of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s consistent referral to a “Zionist” agenda, but not the astounding gullibility of his audience to that popular concern. Moreover, one cannot understand the full reality of Egyptian mobs storming Israel’s embassy in Egypt without acknowledging how Egypt’s justified distaste for Israel, a natural byproduct of two lost wars, grew out of proportion.
Let me be clear: Israel sowed and sows seeds of hatred. Sometimes, its actions were inevitable. But, at other times, costly mistakes were made. Polling data on Israeli views of Muslims reveal that the negative sentiments are very mutual. In fact, only 9 percent of Israeli Jews have a “favorable” rating of Muslims. Undoubtedly, anti-Muslim views among Israeli Jews are strong. However, I would posit that thanks to the physical presence of Muslims and the ever-critical eye of the world, Islamophobia is not pervasive in Israeli society or politics to anywhere near the same degree of anti-Semitism in the Arab world. Nonetheless, Israel’s Islamophobia remains relevant in modern politics as well.
The truth is that I could show you thousands of articles and clips in mainstream Arab media across decades that prove the mainstream nature of anti-Semitism in the Arab world. If you think the political movers are removed from this movement, I could show you countless statements of prominent Arab leaders, of past and present, with revolting statements on Holocaust denial, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” and other delirium. But, anti-Semitism, like any other form of bigotry, can only be partially comprehended through statements or polling data. Pointing out the grave and bigoted misconceptions about historical truth and present reality in the Arab World should not in any way free Israel from criticism or open Arabs to bigotry or generalizations. Nonetheless, stating the truth ought to matter regardless of its possible implications. And the myopic and all-consuming nature of anti-Israeli sentiments in the Arab World is too pervasive and unique to be explained solely by Palestine’s internal politics.
Quite simply, one cannot understand mass politics in the Arab world without admitting the role of anti-Semitism. It matters.

There is no recycling station in my dorm.
Rain or shine, hot or cold, I schlep my plastic containers, paper bags, and cardboard boxes to the nearest recycling room. Sometimes this means epic embarrassment as I flail under a tower of fifteen boxes recently filled with food and random necessities sent from home. More often, it means that I am willing to give the tourists a good show in order to do my part in mitigating climate change.
If I didn’t recycle my 15 cardboard boxes, would it really make a difference? Gernot Wagner, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, doesn’t think so. He recently wrote in The New York Times: “The changes necessary [to stop global warming] are so large and profound that they are beyond the reach of individual action. Individual action...distracts us from the need for collective action, and it doesn’t add up to enough.”
Can this be true? Are individual actions futile? Am I wasting time schlepping?
Absolutely not! Wagner’s argument is dangerously incomplete, and individual actions are essential to creating bottom-up pressure for institutional change. Wagner writes: “Only the right economic policies will enable us as individuals to be guided by self-interest and still do the right thing for the planet.” And in some ways, this is true: Governments must, after all, enact serious green legislation to cap CO2 emissions and reduce global warming. Corporations must integrate sustainability into their production processes, supply chains, and administration. Without these reforms, large-scale global change will be difficult if not impossible. But governments and corporations will only restructure if they know their supporters and shareholders are calling for change.
Individuals must join together in action to communicate their demands to governments and businesses. Historical civil rights, women’s rights, and workers’ rights movements were effective and powerful because thousands of individuals used their voices to demand institutional transformation. American consumers called for change and voiced their outrage collectively in 2009 by boycotting lead-painted toys from China. This created new markets for environmentally friendly toys, as concerned parents utilized their buying power in a demonstration of bottom-up activism.
When this kind of bottom-up support exists, top-down mandates are effective in the long run. The two go hand-in-hand. Even if Congress mandates that all homes use LED light bulbs, individuals must make the decision to buy these light bulbs and install them. No policy can be effective without their conscious participation.
It is the aggregation of individual behaviors that produces collective action. Some people don’t vote because they think that their vote won’t make a difference—but if everyone thought this way, where would democracy be? The same principle applies to the environmental movement. If we refrain from individual action for fear that it won’t make a difference, this prophecy will come true. Change can only occur if each of us believes in individual power and acts accordingly. For example, the average American consumes seven trees worth of paper or wood products each year. Yet 25 million trees would be spared if every American recycled just ten percent of their newspapers.
Finally, individual actions matter because climate change affects individual lives. Floods in Oklahoma, the hottest summer on record in Texas, the increasing intensity of storms, rising ocean temperatures, wildfires—the list of climate-change-induced catastrophes goes on and on. Billions of individuals need to understand how their lives are threatened by humanity’s current path, support green legislation, and rally for sustainable products.
Public education initiatives will enable individuals to understand how climate change affects their lives and what they can do about it. The UK Climate Impacts Programme works with the government to institute adaption policies and public education programs. One case study focuses on helping a community in Northern England adapt to severe floods caused by climate change. Community members understand how they are being affected. They are willing to change their behaviors because it’s personal. The force for bottom-up change unleashed by this kind of education is at least as powerful as top-down mandates.
The green movement is about societal transformation as well as changing the way we think about our lives and the natural world. None of this can be accomplished without individual support and engagement. Our voices coalesce into demands for change. Our actions demonstrate commitment. When we take hold of our existence and utilize our individual power, we can each make a difference—one box at a time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For years, climate scientists have been warning us that if the world continues its current Greenhouse Gas emissions trajectory, humanity may face perilous climate scenarios. Despite notable climate awareness campaigns and significant renewable energy progress over the last decade, the transition to a low carbon global economy powered by cleaner sources of energy isn’t being realized fast enough to avert the worst possible climate scenarios.
A huge and immediate increase in renewable energy investment—both in the deployment of existing, low-carbon technologies and in research dedicated to new disruptive technologies—is desperately needed to jumpstart this transition. Thus far, all sights have been directed towards global financial markets and western nations to make this investment.
Financial markets have been reluctant to invest at the required scale for two reasons. First, if left unsubsidized, existing clean energy technologies are too expensive to compete with traditional energy sources. Second, there are no foreseeable governmental policies that aggressively tax Greenhouse Gas emissions to incentivize clean energy deployment and innovative research at the required scale.
Western governments are also in no position to make the necessary investment given their huge deficits, domestic problems, and focus on economic recovery. They are further limited by their lack of political flexibility, imagination, and will.
Despite the inability of financial markets and the failure of western governments to substantially address climate change, we believe that a timely solution is still possible, but it will have to come from a seemingly unlikely place: China, ironically the world’s largest polluter and carbon emitter.
China is uniquely positioned to make the massive investment that is required to jumpstart the clean energy revolution given its intertwined political and economic decision making system that has proven adept at making aggressive long-term strategic investments and its large foreign exchange reserves. We propose that the Chinese government divest 20 percent of its over $1 trillion worth of U.S. treasury bill holdings and create a $200 billion clean energy focused investment fund.
Fund investment could take many different forms and be spread across diverse stages and types of technologies across the globe. Long-term investments would be made in advancing potential leap-frog technologies and buying equity in promising start-ups, large companies like GE and existing investments funds like Khosla Ventures. Specific dollar amounts could be earmarked for research partnerships with premier academic and research institutions  like MIT and Fraunhofer, global acquisition of strategic energy materials like lithium, attracting top talent to China,  and  creation of more energy focused tax-free special economic zones within China. Diversified investments would both reduce risk and provide China multiple strategic opportunities to establish leadership in the clean energy space.
Creation of the proposed fund would provide China with both soft and hard benefits, while putting the world on a much safer climate trajectory. First, the fund would present China a strategic opportunity to diversify its foreign investment portfolio. Over two-thirds of China’s $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves are held in dollar denominated assets, primarily US treasury bills. Re-allocating $200 billion of dollar reserves to an energy-focused sovereign wealth fund would both reduce exposure to dollar risk and offer long-term higher returns.
More importantly, massive clean energy investment right now will aid China moving forward as it attempts to continue growing its energy-hungry economy in the face of inevitable surging global energy demand and skyrocketing prices—all in the midst of fears of climate change and dwindling supplies of fossil fuels. With these mega-trends all converging, the proposed fund would enable China to lead the nascent clean energy revolution and position the country to become the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy. This investment would allow China to make major simultaneous progress toward advancing its energy security, achieving a sustainable technological advantage, and expanding exports and promoting massive job growth.
We believe that this $200 billion self-serving gambit by China would ignite a monumental global energy race. Historic precedent suggests that nations around the world—especially the United States—will be both fearful of and inspired by China’s bold energy action plan. Over 50 years ago, another communist nation, the Soviet Union, shocked the world by launching Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. The resulting Space Race with the United States unleashed the very best of both America’s and the U.S.S.R.’s competitive spirit and innovative potential.  Despite its Cold War context, the Space Race generated unprecedented scientific achievement and hugely beneficial spin-off technologies.
In the same vein, China’s clean energy fund will force countries around the world to make similar strategic commitments and financial investments in clean energy. The resulting tidal wave of global human energy, creativity, and investment dedicated to advancing renewable energy may just be humanity’s best shot at solving the climate and energy crisis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although it boasts strong female leadership in many of its student organizations, Harvard College cannot claim a similar abundance of female representatives in the Undergraduate Council. Compared with 2010-2011, when 25 percent of UC representatives and a meager eight percent of freshman representatives were women, this year’s UC representatives are just 37 percent female overall, and 25 percent of freshman representatives are female. Yes, these increases are promising, but they are a far cry from accurately representing the over 50 percent of Harvard students who are female. We are disheartened that female leadership in the UC lags behind female leadership in other organizations, and we hope that, by empowering more women to run for the UC and to campaign effectively, we can counteract this trend.
That female participation in the UC still lags behind male participation may be a function of the fact that voters in UC elections, unlike in most leadership contests at Harvard, are not personally acquainted with candidates. This is especially true for the freshman class and may explain why freshman women are less likely to be elected to the UC than upperclassman women: About 34 percent of all UC candidates were female, which is similar to the overall female representation in the UC of 37 percent, but just about 39 percent of freshman candidates were female, considerably lower than the 25 percent of freshman representatives who are female. This speaks to a worrying trend in campus leadership: When candidates are anonymous, voters are likely to adhere to outdated voting paradigms and opt for male candidates.
Additionally, UC representative Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14 noted that freshman male candidates are more likely to campaign door-to-door, “while most of the girls would just slip notes under the door.” Aggressive campaigning is most necessary freshman year, when UC elections are the most competitive, and it’s unfortunate that female candidates are seemingly less willing to engage in such tactics. The UC has tried to reverse these trends in the past by hosting, among other things, a campaigning workshop in the Women’s Center, and we would like to see such efforts continue and increase.
For a variety of reasons, a significant gender disparity among UC members, specifically, is disconcerting. The psychological effects on both female and male students of having all or mostly male student leaders cannot be underestimated. A female student aspiring to a career in government—or, for that matter, for any leadership role—will almost certainly be affected negatively, consciously or not, by a pronounced lack of female role models and representation in one of the most visible student organizations on campus. The cumulative effect of low female representation in the UC renders an inappropriate sense of exclusivity and an alarming lack of possibility. And we should be particularly sensitive to such a trend in our student government, which provides valuable political experience for some our nation’s future politicians.  As of January 2011, women make up just 18 percent of national legislators, 23 percent of state legislators, and a dismal 11 percent of mayors. We are disconcerted by the possibility that a lack of women in the UC is contributing, even marginally, to the larger absence of women in American politics.
For the same reason that racial diversity is valuable and necessary in decision-making, equal gender distribution, too, is necessary in ensuring that UC policies adequately address the interests of both men and women. Men and women come to Harvard with different experiences, and it is important that both men and women are able to voice their opinions on gender-specific issues and shape legislation on these issues. For example, sexual assault is a perennial issue on college campuses, and the UC will only be equipped to begin to address this issue adequately when women, victim to an overwhelming majority of these incidents, are given an equal voice.
Some female UC representatives have expressed that they do not “think that an imbalanced gender ratio would affect their experience or the effectiveness of the UC.” Although we do not dispute the ability of these women to make significant contributions as members of a minority group on the UC, we respectfully disagree and encourage Harvard students to regard this pronounced lack of female leadership as a serious concern rather than one that can be placed on the backburner and tackled by future generations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first meeting of the year, the Undergraduate Council voted unanimously Sunday to pass a new annual fiscal budget, which increased the amount of money allocated to the House Committees and the new Freshman Class Committee.
While comparably less funds will be allocated toward grants for student groups, House committees will be receiving $2000 more than they did last year. Achieving this increase was one of the Council’s biggest priorities, according to UC Treasurer Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13.
A reallocation of funds was also necessary to support the Freshman Class Committee, a new organization that was established to address concerns about the lack of social spaces available for freshmen.
“Freshmen have always had fewer social options, but this is just accepted as the status quo,” UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said. “We are hoping to change that through institutional changes, not just by throwing money at the problem.”
The new committee, which begins its work this semester, consists of six members from the UC, two members from the First Year Social Committee, and four other students who were chosen from the freshmen class through an application process. The committee will meet every other week to hear proposals from other freshmen that seek to address the lack of social space.
“We have a First Year Social Committee, but they don’t have a lot of room for democratic responsiveness,” Ebrahim said. “This group will hold more flexibility, allowing them to plan in a more organic way.”
Although the committee is running as a pilot program this year, Ebrahim expressed hopes that it would eventually be written into the Council’s constitution.
C.C. Gong ’15, Oak Yard representative and a member of the FCC, shared these hopes. “I’m excited to be on this committee during its first year because it is an opportunity to set a precedent,” she said. “I really hope this is here to stay.”
Although the committee has not held its first meeting, Gong said that they have already started planning events, including a campus-wide, spotlight dance that will be held Saturday in the Northwest Labs.
“But the committee is not just about planning events,” said Gong, who is also comping the photo board of The Crimson. “It is also about improving social infrastructure and making renovations.”
In order to accomplish this, the funds allocated towards the FCC have been divided equally into two subgroups: Freshman Dean’s Office Capital Investment and Freshman Life Funds. Half the funds are aimed at building institutions and infrastructure to support freshmen social life, while the other half may be used for events initiated by the FCC.
According to Ebrahim, collaboration with the FDO is crucial.
“The FDO has been working with this problem of social space for a long time so they can provide the committee with valuable insight about logistics, regulations, accessibility issues, and other concerns,” he said. “In other words, the committee will say what the students desire, and the FDO will say what is possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalists and scholars gathered last Friday at the Nieman Foundation to discuss the unique relationship between their respective fields in tackling the issue of illegal immigration—a topic they agreed was generally misunderstood by the public.
The day-long conference, which was co-sponsored by the Graduate School of Education, emphasized the cooperation that is necessary to properly address and portray the effects of immigration on the law, the economy, and education. While academia generates new ideas about immigration, attendees said, journalists are responsible for  presenting that knowledge to the public in a comprehensible way.
Calling the conference a “crucial dialogue” between professionals from the two fields, Ed School professor Vivian S.M. Louie said the successful assimilation of immigrant children into American education systems was central to the discussion.
“Public schools have to educate children regardless of their legal status,” she said.
Michael J. Holland, an Ed School student and one of Louie’s advisees, said he felt hearing the journalists’ experiences was particularly unique and beneficial.
“Sometimes we get inundated with professors,” he said, “so it’s cool to hear a practitioner’s perspective.”
Julia Preston, the New York Times’ national immigration correspondent, spoke about the difficulties she faced in conveying the complexity of immigration-related legal issues in her articles. Preston said her most vocal readers—many of whom oppose illegal immigration—often do not understand the nuances of the term “illegal,” or the fact that undocumented citizens receive civil, not criminal, sentences.
“These stories are damned hard to write,” she said. “There is an area of explanation that journalists need to do about these laws that is just very important. Finding very concise ways to do this in stories ... is something that I view as an increasing part of my responsibility.”
Holland said his interest in immigration issues also stems from a desire to correct misunderstandings. His field of interest is in global citizenship education, which addresses children’s comprehension of the world’s cultures and politics.
“One of the biggest reasons for improving global citizenship is immigration, and the fact that we have so many new residents and the ties that they have with home—remittances that they send back, and the perceptions of the US that they send home,” he said.
A similar conference met in 2008, resulting in a book titled “Writing Immigration: Scholars and Journalists in Dialogue.”
Louie, who also participated in the 2008 discussion, said she is unsure of the future of these gatherings.
“I would hope that there will be [more events of this kind],” she said. “The spirit at an event like this is certainly that we—all of us: policymakers, journalists, scholars, and the public—need to be engaged in this richer dialogue about what the stakes are with immigration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As many students buckled down to take their first midterm exams this past Thursday, the Jewish community came together to usher in the New Year with the celebration of Rosh Hashana.
This year, Rosh Hashana—the date of which is determined by the lunar calendar—occurred later than usual and coincided with a spate of exams and paper due dates. Many students said they found themselves in a stressful bind of trying to set aside time for their religious obligations while also trying to prepare for exams—a problem exacerbated by the fact that many professors were unaware of the holiday, they said.
Emily S. Unger ’13, undergraduate co-chair of the Reform minyan at Harvard Hillel, said that she was not able to celebrate the New Year as she would have preferred. This past week, Unger not only planned Hillel’s Reform Rosh Hashana services, but also took three tests. Rather than reflecting upon the past year, she found herself cramming for exams between meetings with the rabbi.
“I can’t imagine professors trying to give exams on Christmas Eve and expecting students to study,” she explained. “I think it would be nice just if professors were aware that it was happening. It’s good to have that sort of awareness.”
Although less known to the non-Jewish public than the more secular Jewish holidays Hanukkah and Passover, Rosh Hashana is one of two High Holy Days in the Jewish religion. Rosh Hashana is meant to be a time of self-examination and repentance, inviting individuals to reflect upon their actions.
Arun A. Viswanath ’13, the president of Hillel’s Steering Committee, said he was also caught in the exam crunch as he tried to observe the holiday. Viswanath, who does not use electricity, attend class, or write during the Sabbath and the High Holy Days, said he had been studying non-stop for Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Sciences” since Saturday night, which marks the end of the Sabbath.
But Viswanath said he felt faculty were fairly accommodating to the High Holy Days.
SLS20 Professor Daniel Gilbert, who is also Jewish, did not hold class on Rosh Hashana and scheduled the midterm exam for Monday with the holiday in mind. Given efforts like these on the part of faculty members, Viswanath said that he believes Harvard’s current system is the best that it can be. Although he may have to do more work than some of his secular peers, he said, the challenge is feasible and ultimately worth it.
Rabbi Benjamin Greenberg, leader of Hillel’s Orthodox minyan, echoed Viswanath’s sentiments and said that in his experience professors had been generally accommodating of student needs.
“We are dedicated to finding points of intersection between academic work and the work of the High Holy Days,” he said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: OCT. 3, 2011
The Oct. 3 article "Exams Interrupt Jewish High Holidays" incorrectly stated that the date of Rosh Hashanah is determined by the Gregorian calendar. In fact, it is determined by the lunar calendar. Additionally, Rosh Hashanah is not known as "the day of atonement," which refers to Yom Kippur. The article also misstated Emily Unger's class year. She is a member of the Class of 2013, not 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tubas played with gusto and the beer flowed freely at Sunday’s festivities in Harvard Square—but in many ways, it was not your typical Oktoberfest. The event, which organizers expected to draw 150,000 people, featured multiple stages of live music, dozens of local vendors, and numerous street marching bands.
“We didn’t know what to expect,” said Austrian tourist Martin Huber, commenting on the apparent absence of the German traditions typically associated with Oktoberfest. Huber and his parents, who are currently visiting the United States, stood out in the crowd with their traditional lederhosen—fine leather trousers attached to suspenders by ornate ivory buckles. Huber said he enjoyed the festival, which he characterized as “colorful and very bright,” but his family said they preferred the authentic, European Oktoberfest.
“Come to the Munich Beer Festival,” said Huber’s father. “There are not so many drunk people!”
The Harvard Square version of the centuries-old celebration differed noticeably from a “traditional” Oktoberfest.
The smell of Italian sausage, not bratwurst, filled the air, and only three small “biergartens” sold brews at the large festival—and not all of those beers were German in origin. And while many tubas peeked above the crowds, they weren’t playing polka—most laid down the bass line for street bands playing funk and Latin jazz.
The musical revelry began in Davis Square at noon, when a procession of brightly costumed musicians started to make its way from Somerville to Harvard Square. The parade was part of the HONK! music festival, an annual event that brings marching brass bands from around the country to Boston. Playing everything from trumpets to trash cans, members of the ensembles wore unusual “uniforms” consisting of kilts, dresses, wigs, and even stilts.
“It’s organized chaos,” said Andy Minnich, a member of the “Seed and Feed Abominable” band from Atlanta. Gesturing towards his tuba, adorned with glowing Christmas lights and a large cowbell, he said, “I want to be a drummer, but I also have this tuba.”
HONK! calls itself “a festival of activist street bands,” and many performing groups used the parade to make political statements. Some bands incorporated chants against “corporate greed” and war into their songs. Stilt walkers, standing seven or eight feet off the ground, carried banners with slogans like “Another Stilter for Class Warfare” and “Ditch the Rich.”
These colorfully garbed protesters, often dressed in drag, were not alone in the Square. Activists of all persuasions filtered for Peace” and a group soliciting “happiness” Post-It note messages from passers-by. One group even asked festival attendees to sign a petition for the legalization of certain types of marijuana.
But not everyone at the festival was an activist. Gary Sanborn, from West Roxbury came to see the Square’s Oktoberfest for the second time with his wife Marty.
“We love it!” he said. “It’s so cool, even for normal people like us. You just want to be a part of it.”
While Sanborn said he appreciated the merry atmosphere of the festival, many attendees said they tried to embrace an equally long-standing Oktoberfest tradition.
According to one kilt-wearing member of “Seed and Feed Abominable,” who identified himself only as Bill, the band hoped to live up to their slogan, well suited to any kind of Oktoberfest: “Where’s the beer?”

Policymic.com, a website for political commentary and discussion, will sponsor a competition at Harvard this week to find the best campus pundit through a series of online debates—the first of which will take place Monday with a focus on the presence of final clubs on campus.
Site co-founder Chris F. Altchek ’09 said that the winner of the debates will be dubbed the “best pundit” at the College and will have the chance to be featured on the site. A “pundit” is the site’s name for a frequent commenter who has “leveled up” by receiving “mics,” which users award to each other for good comments.
While most of the site is devoted to opinion pieces and users’ comments on them, it also holds “office hours”—live discussions with a professor or politician. Altchek said that a segment of the “best pundit” competition will be an “office hours” installment on Friday with Harvard Economics Professor Jeffrey A. Miron.
There will be similar competitions at the Harvard Law and Business Schools, said Altchek, adding that he hopes to put on similar events at other universities.
Altchek, who left his job at Goldman Sachs to launch the site in March with Stanford graduate Jake Horowitz, said that his academic experiences at Harvard inspired him to create a website where young people can engage in high-quality discussion about range of political issues.
“Our generation doesn’t read online news and comment,” Altchek said. “Facebook is not really a great platform for smart discussions about politics. For us, it’s all about the discussion.”
Altchek said that he missed the lively discussions in the small seminars he took as part of his Social Studies concentration.
“This is an attempt to recreate that,” he said. “I learned just as much from the students around me as professors.”
Altchek said that while his site is meant to emulate the atmosphere of those small seminar discussions, a more traditional news website like the New York Times is analagous to a larger lecture course, where the opinions of individual users are not noticed in a meaningful way.
One of the site’s most important features, Altchek said, is the engagement between readers and authors, citing an instance when former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice responded to a commenter on the site.
Policymic user Allison Gofman ’14 said the site allows her opinions to reach a wide audience and is “more accessible” than blogging sites such as the The Huffington Post.
Gofman added that the site could be “addictive” at times and explained that the game-like reward system gives users a strong incentive to keep commenting.
Matthew K. Clair ’09, who began writing for the site in April, wrote in an email to The Crimson that he thought it had particular appeal for college students.
“It’s a natural extension of the arguments and discussions that [students] are having in their dorm rooms,” Clair said. “PolicyMic provides a necessary platform for this productive sharing.”

When Harvard Kennedy School professor Calestous Juma concluded his guest lecture on African entrepreneurial development for United States in the World 36: “Innovation and Entrepreneurship: American Experience in Comparative Perspective” last Thursday, hands shot into the air.
For the next 30 minutes, the undergraduates—who had trekked across the Charles River to the Harvard Business School for the lecture—queried Juma about the roles of corruption and foreign investment in building Africa’s infrastructure.
Led by Business School professors Joseph B. Lassiter and Mihir A. Desai,  the new General Education course is the first to be offered exclusively to undergraduates at the Business School.
According to Lassiter and Desai, the course is founded on three complementary pedagogical methods: case studies teaching the tenets of entrepreneurship, guest lectures by  professors from across Harvard about different manifestations of innovation, and the implementation of a final project in which the students utilize what they have learned in class to solve real world problems.
For the projects, which include initiatives with the cities of Boston and Washington, D.C., students will have the opportunity to work with organizations in both the private and public sectors,
The launch of the course this fall coincides with the opening of the Harvard Innovation Lab, a space where all University affiliates and local businesses can develop their entrepreneurial ideas through collaboration and instruction. The I-Lab will officially open on Nov. 18.
Although Lassiter said the decision to offer the course was not based on the unveiling of the I-Lab, he said that the two initiatives were related.
“We wanted to manifest the idea of one University and also have a flow of undergraduates that would come and help get the Innovation Lab off to a successful start,” Desai added.
Lassiter said they were originally unsure about the course’s ability to attract students.
“We had no idea whether anybody would walk across the river,” he said.
But the teaching staff was pleasantly surprised when more than 200 students shopped the course. After soliciting and reading more than 150 applications from prospective students, they admitted 95 enrollees.
Both professors lauded the undergraduates for their enthusiasm and engagement in class.
Although Lassiter and Desai said that the course has been in development for a long time, it was formally approved by the Standing Committee on General Education over the summer.
According to Stephanie H. Kenen, director of the Program in General Education, the class does not fall within the traditional bounds of the United States in the World Gen Ed category.
“It pushes the category a bit, but we thought it was worth trying,” she said.
The class has been well-received by enrolled students.
Vijay Kedar ’12, who said he wants to attend business school and is interested in entrepreneurship, praised the course for exposing undergraduates to resources offered at the Business School, such as the I-Lab and guest speakers.
Riju Agrawal ’13 said he signed up for the course because he also wants to attend business school and ultimately start his own company that focuses on energy development in India and China.
He said he has gained knowledge in the class that he has not been able to acquire in any previous course he has taken at the College.
“At Harvard, we’re biased against teaching what are termed ‘skills,’” Agrawal said. “[This course is] fulfilling a need that’s been traditionally overlooked.”

For the first time in decades, Harvard hosted on Friday a “welcome reception” for students who are veterans, marking yet another step in the University’s recent efforts to repair relations with the military after nearly forty years of tension.
“We are very proud to welcome you to the Harvard family,” University President Drew G. Faust said in her opening remarks. “We are proud ... to claim each of you as our own ... We will continue to cultivate an environment in which military service is honored and rightly regarded as public service.”
The welcome, held in the majestic Loeb House ballroom, came a week and a half after Harvard celebrated the opening of an office for the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in the Student Organizations Center at Hilles.
ROTC withdrew from campus at the height of anti-Vietnam War protests in 1968 and was not recognized for nearly four decades. During that time students who wanted to participate in ROTC had to travel to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for physical training and courses in military science.
The University announced in March that it would officially recognize Naval ROTC after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the policy that barred gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.
According to Faust, the University is still in the midst of discussions with the Army and Air Force branches of ROTC about reaching a similar agreement, though a timeline for their return has yet to be established.
“We hope we can have the kind of the arrangement with the other services that we have with the Navy,” University President Drew G. Faust said.
Several speakers said that though Harvard has historically been unwelcoming of the military, relations have improved in recent years, especially during Faust’s tenure. Critics have said that while recognition is a good first step, Harvard still has a ways to go in making cadets and veterans feel welcome on campus.
“That requires an attitude change,” said Capt. Paul E. Mawn ’63 USNR (Ret.), chairman of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC. “It’s not a problem in the senior administration, it is in the faculty and in the general perception of Harvard.”
Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood and other speakers urged veterans to share their experiences in the military with their fellow classmates and to listen to classmates with differing views on the military.
“There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the nature of military service, about the nature of American military service, and this is a remarkable opportunity to share your insights and ideas,” Ellwood said.
Speakers gave credit to Faust, who is descended from more than four generations of military service members, for the recent reconciliation between Harvard and the military.
“She has from day one put an emphasis on public service, broadly defined, including military service,” Harvard Kennedy School Professor David Gergen said. “She has restored military service to its rightful place at Harvard.”
Ellwood echoed these sentiments.
“No one has been more committed to the involvement veterans here at the university, and the reason we have ROTC here and the reason we are the first [Ivy League] university to reinstate it is because of her personal efforts and great energy involved,” Ellwood said.
Since Harvard recognized Naval ROTC in March, other elite universities, such as Yale and Columbia, have followed suit.
Though the reception—which attracted a mainly male audience in gingham shirts and close cropped hair—was targeted at new students, many second and third year students also attended the event.
Regan Turner—a second year student in the joint Kennedy and Business School program, who served in the Marine Corps—said that he appreciated the University’s efforts to reach out to the military service members.
“This demonstrates that the school cares, and that vets shouldn’t feel awkward about their service but instead embrace it and share their experiences,” Turner said.
“I’ve come away very impressed by Harvard in the way they’ve made efforts during my past twelve months,” added Michael Harrison, a second year at the Kennedy School.
The choice of venue for the event was significant, and it was clear that after a 40-year absence the event sought to make a point of bringing members of the military back into the Harvard community. During World War II, Loeb House housed a Navy training program, but since then it has become the site of formal University meetings and functions for groups like the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
Friday’s event was held in the house’s lavish ballroom, a space with glittering chandeliers, a large fireplace with an expansive mirror above its mantle, and a parquet floor. The speeches were followed by an outdoor reception complete with waiters and white linens.

Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department Chair Ali S. Asani ’77 will strive to promote religious literacy as the new director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard—more than 30 years after he first began to study Islam as a Harvard undergraduate.
As director of the program, which was founded from a gift in 2005, Asani said he hopes to promote innovation in teaching and attract renowned Muslim scholars, making Harvard the leader in all areas of Islamic studies.
“Harvard has world class faculty who are engaged in the study of many different aspects of Islam and Muslim societies but they are scattered among departments and schools,” said Asani. “This is something that I am hoping to work towards during my term as director ...When all four of the Prince Alwaleed professorships are filled, there will be no university that I know of that has such a breadth of programming in Islamic Studies.”
In addition to serving as NELC chair, Asani is also lauded as an innovative and dedicated professor.
Rebecca K. Gilmore ’12, who took both a freshman seminar and a Culture and Belief course taught by Asani, said he uses art and literature to illustrate the diversity of interpretations of Islam among different Muslim cultures,
“Religion has become so politicized and co-opted in discourses of nationalism,” Asani said. “But ... if you look at religion through other lenses like art and literature, they actually bring people together and promote understanding.”
Growing up in Kenya, Asani said he observed a discrepancy between how Islam was represented in Western sources and how he had personally come to understand the religion. He also noticed a lack of understanding of many of the large Muslim populations outside of the Middle East.
“There was so little representation of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa,” Asani said. “In fact, I put in my college essay that one of the things I was interested in doing was creating a better informed understanding of areas of Islam that are ignored.”
When Asani arrived in Cambridge, he joined nine students as the only undergraduates in the study of comparative religion, at the time an experimental concentration that had just been approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Among the group, Asani was the only one not studying Christianity, instead choosing to focus on Islam and Hinduism.He credits an introductory course on Islamic literature with putting him on the path towards teaching.
“The class was actually held in the professor’s office,” he recalled. “It turned out I was the only student in the class.”
After making sure no one else was coming, the late Professor of Indo-Muslim Culture Annemarie Schimmel closed her eyes and began speaking with encyclopedic knowledge, Asani said—and from then, he was hooked.
Schimmel later became a mentor for Asani, who graduated summa cum laude, received a Ph.D. from Harvard under Schimmel, and followed her into the world of academia.
“There is no university that matches the strength we can potentially have in Islamic Studies.,” Asani said. “We just need better collaboration and after filling in some pressing gaps in the curriculum, we could easily do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Nobel Committee announced Monday that Ralph M. Steinman, Harvard Medical School ‘68, would share the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann. The three were honored by the committee for work on the immune system that may shed light on new ways to fight cancer and infectious disease.
The announcement, however, came just three days after Steinman’s death at 68 from pancreatic cancer, which he had been treating with some of the same methods that he pioneered as a clinician-researcher at Rockefeller University in New York.
The Nobel committee did not learn of Steinman’s death until two hours after the official prize announcement.
Though the rules for awarding Nobel prizes strictly prohibit posthumous awards, the committee has since announced that Steinman will remain a laureate alongside the other two recipients.
“The statutes specify that if a person has been awarded a prize and has died before receiving it, the prize may be presented,” read a press release from the committee. “The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize.”
The Nobel committee has not specified a recipient for Steinman’s share of the $1.5 million prize. It remains unclear whether a new recipient will be named or if the prize money will be split evenly between Beutler and Hoffmann.
In awarding the prize, the Nobel Committee said that Steinman, Beutler, and Hoffmann’s work had “revolutionized our understanding of the immune system by discovering key principles for its activation.”
Steinman’s research contributed to the prostate cancer treatment Provenge, the first cancer vaccine to be approved in the United States. His work dates back to his 1973 discovery of the “dendritic cells” of the immune system, which activate T cells and regulate the body’s process of adaptive immunity. The adaptive immune defenses studied by Steinman are triggered if an invading microorganism is able to break past the body’s innate immune defenses­—Beutler and Hoffmann’s area of expertise.
HMS Assistant Professor Nir Hacohen, who also conducts research in immunology, credits Steinman with his intense persistence in pursuing research in what was then a relatively new and unestablished field.
“Each small increment of understanding took a decade [to achieve],” Hacohen said. “The field didn’t really explode until the 1990’s. He was able to take a discovery from nothing to something really interesting with a lot of persistence and optimism.”
According to Hacohen, Steinman helped organize conferences and promote discussion about the importance of dendritic cells.
Recently, Steinman had been working on ways in which dendritic cells could be used to fight cancer. Hacohen said that researchers have developed a method by which a sample of a patient’s dendritic cells are extracted and modified in the lab to activate only the T-cells that target cancer cell-specific proteins.
Hacohen said that recent studies indicate that this type of therapy may be successful in the future. He also stressed that dendritic cells could be used to enhance vaccines for a wide array of diseases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sophomore Peyton Johnson buried a penalty kick in the 93rd minute to give the Crimson (6-4, 2-0 Ivy) a 2-1 victory at Yale (4-4-2, 1-1) on Saturday.
After a slow start, Harvard picked it up in the second half to tie the game at one.
The Crimson trailed much of the contest after Bulldog freshman forward Meredith Speck netted a 17th-minute goal to give Yale a 1-0 advantage.
The rookie took a cross from junior midfielder Kristin Forster and ripped a left-footed strike from the top of the box past Harvard freshman goalkeeper Bethany Kanten.
“We didn’t bring what Yale brought in the first half,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said.
The Bulldogs exploited the Harvard defense out wide and controlled the tempo in the first half, out-shooting the visiting team, 4-3.
Despite a few chances, Harvard could not find an equalizer in the frame and went into halftime trailing.
“We were disappointed with how we were playing at that point,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said, “but we came out [for the second half] completely reenergized and ready to go.”
The Crimson was knocking on the door from the start of the second half, as sophomore forward Elizabeth Weisman put a shot on target in the 50th minute that was turned away by Yale goalkeeper Adele Jackson-Gibson, who made five saves on the day.
It wasn’t until the 60th minute when Harvard was finally able to break through the Bulldogs’ defense. Baskind tucked home a one-timer near post on a cross delivered by senior Patricia Yau.
“[Yau] brought it up the side and played a perfect ball across the net, and I just barely got in front of my defender to poke it in,” Baskind said.
Neither team broke the tie in regulation, and the score remained knotted at one as the final whistle blew.
But it was a brief overtime period thanks to Johnson, who ended the contest just over two minutes in.
A 92nd-minute corner kick led to a scramble in the box, and Johnson gained possession on the right side. She fired a shot that struck a Yale defender’s hand, automatically drawing a yellow card and penalty kick.
Johnson calmly stepped up to take the penalty kick and drove the ball just past a diving Jackson-Gibson, who guessed correctly on the play but was unable to get a hand on the ball as it flew inside the left post.
It was a tale of two halves for the Crimson. Harvard’s defense stepped up after allowing an early goal, with Kanten recording two saves.
“We really were defending well in the second half, after being late to everything in the first half,” Leone said.
The Crimson offense out-shot the Bulldogs in the second half, 8-4, while putting home the lone goal.
“The front line was creating havoc,” said Leone, who also credited junior midfielder Aisha Price for keeping the pressure on with her dangerous long throw-ins.
Both teams had chances to go ahead late in regulation. Following Baskind’s equalizer, freshman midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby had two shots on net and was twice denied by Jackson-Gibson. Yale threatened with a dangerous corner kick in the final minute, followed by a Harvard counterattack in the final 30 seconds.
“It was just an amazing battle in the second half,” Leone said. “It was a game of inches.”
The winning goal was the club’s first penalty kick of the year and Johnson’s second goal in her sophomore campaign.
Baskind, who scored her fifth goal of the season, ties Penn’s Marin McDermott for tops in the Ivy League. She also leads the league with 16 points on the year.
But she is the last to accept credit for the team’s success.
“It really takes a ton of heart and every player on the team to win a game like that,” Baskind said. “It was a great team effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It just wasn’t Harvard’s night Saturday evening in New Haven, Conn. Despite a late clinic put on by the Crimson men’s soccer team against rival Yale, a defensive misjudgment early in the first half handed the Bulldogs a narrow 1-0 victory over the Crimson in a fiery Ancient Eight matchup.
“Overall, it was a decent game for us,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “The second half was definitely better than the first half for us. In the second half we out-played them, out-shot them pretty badly, but dropping three points [in the league standings] in our first Ivy game was pretty disappointing for the team.”
As a light drizzle beat down on Yale’s Reese Stadium, the game began as many had expected—at full pace with neither side backing down from early challenges.
It was the Crimson which had the first of many early chances to open the scoring. A pass to Harvard senior Jamie Rees in front of the Bulldog goal was squandered when the midfielder’s shot flew high off the goal frame.
Minutes later, a Yale counterattack resulted in Max Morice taking a powerful shot on goal that was blocked by the Harvard back line.
As the fast-paced encounter unfolded, the home side’s pressure on Harvard’s defense continued.
Working off a long throw-in into the penalty box in the 14th minute, Bulldog Peter Jacobson knocked the ball to teammate Chris Dennen, who then headed the ball past senior goalkeeper Austin Harms and into the back of the net, giving Yale the 1-0 lead.
Despite the early goal, Harvard quickly regrouped and resumed its offensive pressure.
During the 15th minute, the Crimson nearly found the equalizer, when junior forward Zack Wolfenzon wrested possession of a 50-50 ball in front of the opposing goal and summarily delivered a shot on net. But Bulldogs goalkeeper Bobby Thalman’s superbly timed diving effort earned him a save—and for the Yale fans in attendance, a breath of relief.
Midway into the first half, the Harvard front line—anchored by Rogers, freshman forward Michael Innocenzi and junior co-captain Scott Prozeller—took control of the match and fired a number of shots on target. But Thalman once again rose to the occasion and made a flurry of saves to deny the Crimson.
In the 24th minute of play, with Harvard threatening again, Rogers fired a shot on target to force a fingertip save from the Bulldog goalkeeper.
Minutes later, the two were in the thick of it again. Gazing at a ball crossed into the Yale penalty box, Rogers looked to have a clear shot on goal, but his header attempt floated tamely into the palms of the host goalie.
For the half, although Yale held a 1-0 lead on the scoreboard, the Crimson held the lead in shots, 8-6.
The second half of the match started slowly, and neither side mustered a shot on goal for about 10 minutes. But then the game sprang back to life.
At the 56th minute, co-captain Tim Linden blasted a shot on goal, but a Bulldog defender blocked the ball and knocked it out of play for a corner kick.
Five minutes later, Harvard’s Zack Wolfenzon had another fantastic scoring opportunity when he turned past a defender and blasted a powerful shot on goal from the edge of the penalty box. But the Yale netminder once again proved to be one step ahead, batting the ball out of play to preserve the Bulldogs’ lead.
As time dwindled down on the scoreboard, the Crimson continued its relentless search for an equalizer by out-shooting Yale, 11-1, in the second half.
But despite Harvard’s offensive pressure, Thalman and the Bulldogs back line held on to earn the victory and to claim bragging rights in the Ivy League’s most storied rivalry.
“The biggest takeaway in this game was that we had a slow start to the first half,” junior forward Brian Rogers said. “We all have realized that in order to win Ivy League games, we cannot continue to have slow starts. We have to play with a certain level of tenacity from the beginning, and not just at the end.”
For the match, although the Crimson out-shot Yale overall, 19-7, Bulldog keeper Thalman registered eight saves to earn the shutout over the away side.
Harvard picks up action next weekend when it travels to Ithaca, N.Y., for its second Ivy League matchup.
“We are really excited to get back on the field against Cornell next weekend,” Rogers said. “The Ivy League is completely open this year, and there are no dominant teams. So with one win, we can really put our season back on track.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following his team’s loss to Harvard Saturday, Lafayette coach Frank Tavani spoke in the press conference in hushed tones, as if his dog had just died or he had a splitting migraine.
Tavani’s disposition couldn’t have been more fitting.
The Crimson had just picked apart his team in an embarrassing 31-3 defeat.
It wasn’t the 31 points Harvard scored that most upset Tavani. The Leopard defense did a decent job of shutting down the Crimson attack for parts of the game. In the third quarter, Harvard had a grand total of nine yards of offense.
No, what really made Tavani look like he had eaten dirt was the “3” on the scoreboard. Despite 272 yards of total offense and 16 first downs, all the Leopards managed were three measly points.
“I’ve certainly got to apologize to our fans and everybody else that was here,” said Tavani, who appeared ready to punt his entire team. “I have to find guys who got some heart, have some pride, and  return to some purpose and have some passion ... We’ve got some guys who are just hanging out there at the edges. We talk a good game, but we don’t follow through.”
Yes, Tavani had good reason to be livid; Lafayette had played an incredibly sloppy game—that much is clear. Whenever a team has nearly as many fumbles (2) as points, or twice as many yards lost on penalties (101) as rushing yards (42), something clearly went very, very wrong.
But to say the Leopards just gave it away doesn’t do Harvard justice. For all Lafayette’s struggles, it was the Crimson which owned the day, not the home team who gave it away.
And while Harvard’s offense did enough—more than enough—the real performance of the day came from the Crimson defense.
In what is quickly becoming a realization of Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s preseason hopes, the defense has emerged as a dominant, ruthless force.
In the past two games, the team has allowed a combined 10 points by a pair of strong offenses. Lafayette hadn’t been held to three points or fewer in a decade. And a few weeks ago, the Leopards dismantled a very good Penn team, 37-12.
So what options do less-gifted offenses have against Harvard?
The Crimson just has so many weapons. For starters, it is blessed with a shut-down corner in senior cornerback Matt Hanson, given the unenviable task of guarding the opponent’s best receiver every week. In the last two games, Hanson has limited two stars—Brown’s Alex Tounkara-Kone and Lafayette’s Mitchell Bennett—to a total of 66 yards and no touchdowns.
Next to Hanson in the secondary, senior free safety Dan Minamide has filled in brilliantly for Collin Zych ’11. After some kinks in game one, Minamide and the secondary have allowed just one completion of 30 yards or more since. And in the past two games, Minamide has developed a knack for being in the right place at the right time, intercepting two balls in the end zone at key points in the game.
Beneath the secondary, the linebacker corps has been just as impressive. Junior linebacker Joshua Boyd, a second-stringer when the year began, led the team in tackles for a second straight week. Captain Alex Gedeon, in addition to tallying eight tackles, brilliantly timed a hit during coverage of a huge punt by junior Jacob Dombrowski to force a fumble. The ensuing touchdown gave Harvard an insurmountable lead.
But perhaps the crown jewel of the vaunted Crimson defense, the facet that makes it arguably the best in the league, is its defensive line—even Tavani acknowledged that.
Of course, senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz leads the way. The 450-pound bench-presser set a goal of 10 sacks prior to this season, and despite being double-teamed almost every play, he’s well on his way with two sacks after three games.
But Ortiz’s biggest impact may not be shown in his own stat line. While he harasses quarterbacks at least once a possession, Ortiz absorbs two blockers and opens up holes for his teammates.
Those guys are hard to handle as well. You neutralize Ortiz? Then deal with junior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu. Get rid of him? Then meet fellow defensive tackle Zach Hodges. He’s only a freshman, but he’s clearly learned quickly from his elders.
And new weapons keep emerging for the Crimson. Junior defensive end Grant Sickle led Harvard with one-and-a-half sacks on Saturday, leading a five-sack effort for the visitors.
What does the D-line dominance mean? That Ivy quarterbacks will be giving turf a lot of mouth-to-mouth this year.
The Crimson “D” hasn’t been infallible, though. Brown and Lafayette certainly had their chances. But when the Harvard defense has needed to step up most—in the red zone—the squad has done just that. Opponents are 1-of-4 inside the twenty-yard line over the past two games.
The red zone brilliance shouldn’t be too surprising. As early as the second possession of the season, when Holy Cross recovered a fumbled punt at Harvard’s three-yard line, the Crimson stepped up, surrendering only three points.
“We do a great job in the red zone,” Murphy said. “We really prepare well, we really have a little added intensity, the type of intensity you have to have, the type of resiliency you have to have.”
So to the offenses of the Ancient Eight: Good luck. You’ll need it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EASTON, Pa.—For all the strengths of the Harvard football team so far this year, the health of its quarterbacks hasn’t been one of them.
Since a hamstring injury that senior starter Collier Winters suffered in the first game of the year, he has yet to make an appearance.
His backup, junior Colton Chapple, has played well as a replacement, throwing for three touchdowns in a game and a half at the helm.
But he didn’t return on Saturday at Lafayette after the first half, suffering back cramps that kept him out of the game. By the time he left, Harvard already had a 17-3 lead.
Sophomore third-string quarterback Michael Pruneau filled in for the remainder of the game. Early in his collegiate debut, he looked uncomfortable and nervous, fumbling twice in his first three drives. Though he managed to recover both, he looked solidly outmatched by Lafayette’s secondary to start the third quarter.
“We felt comfortable that we could get the job done with Mike [Pruneau],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Our defense was playing so well we felt confident doing it and obviously didn’t want to put Colton in a position of having a serious injury.”
After recovering a fumbled punt, it finally looked like the quarterback settled down—but he caught a few key breaks that certainly helped.
Pruneau completed his first career pass to senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch, and two Leopard personal fouls on the same play put the ball on the Lafayette two-yard line.
On the next play, the Leopards deflected Pruneau’s pass into the end zone, but it landed squarely in the arms of sophomore tight end Cameron Brate for the third-stringers’ first-career touchdown.
The quarterback looked more comfortable in the fourth, but his role remained limited. Pruneau was four-for-six on the day, throwing for 44 yards in addition to his one touchdown.
SPECIAL OLYMPICS
The season is still just a few games old, but the play of Harvard’s special teams has been among the strongest elements of its game so far.
Junior punter Jacob Dombrowski’s performance on Saturday was his best of the year, and it highlighted the strength of the Crimson’s kicking units.
Dombrowski kicked six times, averaging 44.2 yards per punt, including one inside the Lafayette 20. The junior punter has averaged about 40 yards per punt this season.
“We’ve felt since we saw Jake at our summer camp a couple years ago that he had the potential to be a major college punter, and he’s worked really hard on his craft,” Murphy said. “He was banged up last year, and I think he’s just starting to come into his own in terms of feel and confidence.”
But one third-quarter punt from Dembrowski was clearly his most impressive of the day. After a three-and-out, the punter hit a booming 54-yarder from the Crimson 23.
Despite the length of the punt, impressive hang time allowed captain linebacker Alex Gedeon to get to the kick, forcing a fumble.
Junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk recovered the loose ball. Just before he went down, he handed it off to senior safety Matthew Hanson, who ran it in for a touchdown.
The score was taken back just moments later when it was ruled that the handoff to Hanson—who stood a few feet in front of Juszczyk—was an illegal forward pass, but the Crimson kept possession and scored later in the drive.
“I saw [Jusczcyk] looking to hand the ball off to somebody as he was getting tackled, [and I] went for it,” Hanson said.  “Honestly, I didn’t know that was a rule that you couldn’t hand the ball forward,” he added as Murphy gave his safety a jokingly incredulous look. “I learned that today, so that’s unfortunate, but I’ll tell my grandkids about that play anyways.”
FLAG BEARERS
For most of the game, it was very clear that Harvard controlled the momentum of the contest.
Lafayette penalties played an important role in shifting momentum towards the Crimson, and the Leopards drew flags in costly situations all day.
In the third quarter, it looked like Lafayette had scored a touchdown to bring the team back within seven points. But the play was called back on a holding call, and Leopard quarterback Andrew Shoop threw an interception to Harvard senior defensive back Dan Minamide two plays later, leaving Lafayette in a 17-3 hole.
Lafayette struggled to maintain its composure after that. After the Leopards’ botched punt return, the home team earned two major penalties on the same play.
After a roughing the passer call on a late hit to Pruneau, Lafayette linebacker Leroy Butler threw his helmet on the ground in frustration, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct call.
The penalty struggles continued in garbage time. After another touchdown with about three minutes left gave Harvard a 30-3 lead, Lafayette committed two more personal fouls on the extra point, one of which led to an ejection.
In total, the team drew 16 penalties for 101 yards.
“We just did a number of things to hurt ourselves: four holding penalties, four false starts, missed tackles,” Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said. “Quite honestly, the way we’re playing right now, there’s no one on our schedule that we can beat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a day commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 1981 Harvard women’s field hockey team’s successes, the Crimson alumni weren’t the only ones celebrating. Harvard (5-3, 2-1 Ivy) took a dominant step forward on Saturday as it crushed Brown (1-8, 0-3), 4-0.
The first major offensive attack came at the 28:48 mark of the first half. After the Bears’ penalty corner shot was blocked, the Crimson launched a counterattack that took the ball downfield. Freshman Noel Painter sent a quick pass to junior Kim Goh, but the ball escaped its target and the storm was temporarily weathered.
But, with 15:20 left in the half, junior Katelin Wahl dribbled the ball into a tight pack and managed to send off a shot that put Harvard on the scoreboard, 1-0.
Play continued with a slew of penalty corner shots for the Bears that spanned the rest of the first half. While Brown did not take advantage of these shots, Crimson coach Sue Caples was still clear on her team’s need to improve in the second half, and improve it did. Despite the penalty corner disparity in the first period, Harvard ended up on top of that category, earning 11 shots to its opponent’s seven.
“I think we battled Brown really hard for 70 minutes,” Caples said. “It took us a half to start getting the results. We should have had more to show for in the first half, but Brown played tough and had a lot of opportunities. Most of them were corners.
“We need to do a better job of taking care of the ball in the circle, but I think in the second half, we made some really good adjustments and controlled things. We were really pleased with the second-half performance.”
The second half opened with a Crimson goal after only 18 seconds. Painter buried a shot assisted by Catriona McDonald, and it set the pace for the rest of the game.
“I think the run down by Cat in the first 15, 20 seconds was pretty spectacular,” Caples said. “We have a lot of speed out there. Speed is a very dangerous weapon, and it’s hard to defend.”
This was evident as Harvard continued to put increased pressure on the Bears, giving up fewer shots on goal as the game went on. But whenever a Brown player did penetrate the Crimson’s defense, junior goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulus put a clear stop to the drive.
“She’s a rock,” said Caples of her goalkeeper. “Solid, great leadership back there. [She was] big defensively.”
Tassopoulus had 12 saves on the day, leading the defense to its second shutout win of the season
“Our mentality was to really try to keep them from getting shots,” Tassopoulus said. “They got some, but I think we did a good job of holding our circle and making sure we were mentally tough.”
When faced with a penalty corner and a penalty stroke in succession, Tassopoulus denied the shots and fended off yet another Bears’ attack.
“I was trying to stay very focused and just watch the ball all the way … At that point, you just have to hope that we can stop it.”
To complement the steady defense, Harvard’s offense also stepped up. Sophomore Kyleigh Keating knocked a close-range shot into the bottom left corner of the net to increase the Crimson’s lead to 3-0 at 53 minutes.
To cap the scoring off, a breakaway led by sophomore Bridget McGillivray and finished off by junior Emma Keller gave Harvard its final goal of the night, setting the score at 4-0.
Caples was very satisfied with the overall effort, noting the consistency of her team at this point of the young season.
“We’re working to put a complete game together,” Caples said. “We’re really pleased. Great team effort.”
Tassopolous was also content with the Crimson’s game, noting the offensive prowess throughout.
“We were able to come out strong and keep the pressure high the entire game and come up with shots at different times,” Tassopoulus said.

After beating Brown on Saturday, the Harvard field hockey team (6-3, 2-1 Ivy) won in stunning fashion, defeating Vermont (6-6, 0-1 America East), 2-1, in overtime.
Though regulation was filled with strong defensive play, the overtime period was over just as soon as it started. Only 37 seconds into the extra period, the Crimson broke through the Catamount defense to score the final tally.
Angling her way across the top of the circle, Harvard freshman midfielder Sydney Jenkins sent a reverse shot towards the net. After deflecting off of a Vermont defender, the ball sailed into the net, and the Crimson rushed the field in victory.
“I wasn’t sure if it went in, so I was just kind of looking around,” Jenkins said. “It was kind of a blur. [It was] so exciting, but definitely a team effort.”
The play resulted from a strong pass by freshman midfielder Caitlyn Rea, who gave Jenkins the chance to use her quickness to dart past a Catamount defender.
Both teams struggled to get solid opportunities at the goal in the first half, but Harvard managed to keep the ball on the Vermont side of the field.
There were a couple centering feeds that resulted in goal-scoring chances, but many times, the ball flew wide left or right.
Catamount sophomore goalie Stephanie Zygmunt was stellar, as she deflected every ball sent her way. The Crimson managed seven shots on goal in the first half compared to Vermont’s three, but Zygmunt held her ground using her padding to fend off potential Harvard goals.
The Crimson’s defense prevented the Catamounts from generating any substantial scoring opportunities in the first half.
As a result, the game was a stalemate, 0-0, going into the break.
“Vermont is a very talented and athletic team,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “That was a very tactical game, a very skillful game between teams that complement each other very well.”
In the second half, the game opened up a little bit for the Crimson as it generated a host of chances.
Harvard put 15 shots on goal, and generated eight penalty corners, but time after time, Zygmunt made the key stops to keep the Crimson off the scoreboard.
The Catamounts were able to tally the first goal when Vermont junior forward Taylor Silvestro scored on a second-chance opportunity, scooping the ball into the back of the net as she fell to the ground.
Harvard was able to respond quickly, scoring six minutes later on a penalty corner.
Senior back Georgia McGillivray was able to shoot the ball past Zygmunt after a quick pass from freshman forward Noel Painter.
Painter finished with a goal and two assists during the course of two games over the weekend.
“Turning the game around was mostly mental,” Jenkins said. “We were basically at the same places that we practiced.”
After tying the game, the Crimson had many opportunities to get the go-ahead goal in regulation, but Harvard was unable to capitalize on either of two penalty corners.
At one point, co-captain midfielder Carly Dickson had a chance to put the Crimson on top with a penalty stroke, but her shot sailed high over the net.
Halfway into the season, the Harvard freshmen have already contributed greatly to the team, scoring eight out of the Crimson’s 23 goals.
“There are no freshmen at this point,” Caples said. “They all come with a lot of field hockey background and experience. They’re skilled [and] athletic, and they have speed. They’re competitors, and they get it done.”
The Crimson has won four straight games, and the squad currently boasts a 5-0 record at home.
Harvard will try to maintain its perfect home record next week as it faces off against sixth-ranked Stanford.
“I think we raised our level today, which is really very exciting,” Caples said. “[Sunday], we could see glimpses that the bar has been raised [for this team], and we can keep growing and keep getting better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This season, the Harvard men’s cross country team hopes to go the distance. On Friday, it made eight kilometers of progress.
The Crimson traveled to Bethlehem, Pa., on Friday to compete in Lehigh University’s Paul Short Invitational. The men’s team placed ninth out of 45 schools, scoring 279 points in total and finishing ahead of Ivy League competition Princeton and­—for a second-straight meet—Yale.
The women’s squad also turned in a solid performance, finishing in 14th place.
In a year already full of breakout moments, sophomore James Leakos added one more, completing the race with a time of 24:14. Out of more than 400 runners, Leakos finished in fifth place, first among Ivy runners.
“It was a very good race for me and for a lot of other guys on the team. We felt pretty good about it,” Leakos said. “We managed it pretty well. All the other Ivy teams were there, and we managed really well against them, so we’re excited about that.”
Freshman Billy Orman also came up big for Harvard, finishing in 24:58, second among freshmen and 32nd overall. Orman, who completed last meet in a time second only to Leakos, has shown remarkable skill transitioning from the high school to collegiate level of cross country, as this was only his second race for the Crimson.
“He’s handling the adjustment really, really well,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I’ve been really impressed with Billy—it’s a big adjustment. [Runners struggle with] so many things freshman year, but especially the transition from 5k to 8k. He’s handling [that] well and the increased volume in our training well. I’ve been really pleased with his progress so far.”
Orman echoed Saretsky’s thoughts regarding the transition, citing the difficulties of adapting to a new race. Despite his finish as one of the top freshmen in the meet, Orman believes he still has room to improve.
“I was very happy with it,” Orman said. “But, I feel like I could have done better, I could have paced my race a little better. I think I went out a little too hard. Other than that, I was really happy with the race.”
Leakos also admired Orman’s efforts both Friday and for the season as a whole, mirroring his coach’s thoughts regarding the considerable progress he has already made.
“He’s running really well, he’s very talented,” Leakos said. “I think he’s just going to keep getting better. He’s a great kid.”
Harvard last competed at the Paul Short Invitational in 2007, when the squad set an average time of 25:25. On Friday, the Crimson bested its predecessors with an average time of 25:05. Saretsky attributes this improvement to the skill and dedication of this year’s team.
“Our team was just different, [going] towards a different place. This group … [has] a lot of talent,” Saretsky said. “They’re working hard, and really, I think, enjoying each race.”
One accident occurred in Friday’s meet—a collision between two runners resulted in a major holdup in the middle of the race. Many got delayed by this spill, including members of the Crimson.
“This kid went down in front of them … and it took them a while to climb back up [to full speed],” Leakos said.
On the woman’s team, senior Kailyn Kuzmuk once again led the Crimson to the finish line. Coming in 73rd out of a pool of almost 400, Kuzmuk ran the six-kilometer race in 21:51. Harvard placed 15th out of the 45 competing teams.
“Overall it was a good, beginning race for everyone,” Kuzmuk said. “We definitely have a lot more potential, and, as we continue training throughout the season, hopefully we’ll be able to beat some of the teams that beat us last weekend. But I think it was a good step towards our overall goal.”
Kuzmuk’s excitement mainly stemmed from the overall progress that the team is making. Following Kuzmuk, senior Jeanna Mack came in at 22:01. Sophomore Emily Rese, and freshmen Viviana Hanley and Alaina Alvarez rounded out the Crimson’s top five, running respective times of 22:05, 22:09, and 22:18.
“There are a few things I know I want to work on,” Kuzmuk said. “But I’m excited to have all the girls finish really close together. I think that is something that is really promising. For the rest of the season, I think just being able to work together to do a little bit better each meet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team got off to a sluggish start on a wet and rainy day at the Course at Yale, playing its way to a fifth-place finish at the MacDonald Cup this past weekend.
The Crimson shot a collective 583 for the weekend and finished 23 over par for 36 holes, sharing the fifth spot with Sacred Heart.
An opening round 294 proved too much to overcome for Harvard, who struggled to maintain consistency throughout the weekend.
“We had a slow start to the tournament, pretty much as a team,” captain Tony Grillo said.
Grillo said the team shot poorly on the front nine on both days and had to play catch up the whole time.
Harvard’s struggles were also augmented by a particularly impressive performance by Yale, who came out strong from the start and shot 280 on Saturday.
The Bulldogs jumped out to a six-stroke lead over the field before cruising to a five-stroke victory over Princeton.
Harvard finished fourth out of the six Ivy schools competing, not including the Bulldog’s second team. Yale and Princeton were joined by Dartmouth in the top three of the competition.
Despite the struggles, Harvard did have some bright spots.
Senior Mark Pollak and sophomore Theodore Lederhausen tied for ninth place for individual golfers with a three-over 143, and both shot a one over par (71) on Sunday.
Both Grillo and sophomore Seiji Liu thought that the team improved its shots on the back nine, especially on the final day.
“Some of us got bad starts,” Liu said. “But over the last nine or so holes we got it together and played better down the stretch.”
Grillo specifically noted that over the last portion of the back nine on Sunday, a few key players really found their stroke.
Liu shot two under par over the last six holes, Pollak was three under over the last four, and Grillo shot three under over the last three holes.
Also, Grillo managed an impressive feat on the fifth hole on Sunday. The captain holed out on the par three in what proved to be an up-and-down day.
The last nine holes of the tournament boosted the confidence of many of the team’s golfers, according to Liu and Grillo. Both said they experienced problems with their technique throughout the weekend, and they felt that the end of Sunday helped clear those problems.
“I had several bad holes where I felt I had lost my swing,” Liu said. “But I felt good over the last seven or eight.”
The Crimson brought two other golfers: sophomore Michael Lai, who tied for 37th, and sophomore Kevin McCarthy who tied for 65th.
While the weather was a factor for all players, the Harvard golfers felt differently about how they thoughT the rain affected the course, which was voted the top college course in the nation by Golfweek last September.
“Wet weather—at least for Yale—makes the course more approachable,” Grillo said. “It made the course easier for everyone.”
He noted that putts rolled well on the green and fairways were easier to hit with the slick grass.
But Liu thought that the wet course was more difficult for people who hit higher approach shots.
He noted that low hitters might have an easier time with the fast speed of the greens, but overall, the rain made the course more challenging.
“The course conditions were terrible, and we had to work around that,” he said. “It was completely flooded.”
The rain did have a tangible impact on the tournament beyond playing conditions. Instead of playing 36 holes on Saturday and 18 on Sunday as originally scheduled, Saturday’s golf was delayed, and players only got in 18 holes.
But Liu hopes that the team can learn from its experience at Yale and fix its mistakes going into the Big 5 Invitational next weekend. It will be Harvard’s penultimate invite of the season.
“We have to work on our putting game a lot more,” he said. “As a team, we are as good as anyone out there. It’s just a matter of putting it all together for two or three rounds.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After taking Princeton (10-5, 3-0 Ivy) to a fifth set in a losing effort on Friday, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (8-5, 1-2) pulled it together to take down Penn (5-8, 1-2) in its third consecutive five-set game. The victory against the Quakers on Saturday on the road gave Harvard its first conference win as it heads into the heart of its season.
“It’s been a battle in the Ivy games we’ve seen so far,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “You have to work for every single point … but it just comes down to who wants it more.”
HARVARD 3, PENN 2
On Saturday at Penn, the Crimson showed that it was not going to let its defeat at Princeton keep it down, overpowering the Quakers 25-21, 20-25, 25-21, 20-25, 15-13.
In the first set, Harvard fell behind, 7-1, but caught up to Penn to even the score at 15. The Crimson finally took the lead after an ace from co-captain middle blocker Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, bringing the score to 19-18. After a 4-0 stretch, Harvard secured a 23-19 lead before freshman outside hitter Kristen Casey brought a close to the set, putting the Crimson on top, 25-21.
But the Quakers were not willing to give in easily, leading the second set by as many as seven points. Harvard fought to take the lead at 19-18, but Penn tied up the game and eventually won the set, 25-20.
The third set was tied at seven until the Crimson went on a 9-3 run to set the score at 16-10. Following a Quaker error that made the score 20-12, Harvard kept the steady lead, and sophomore middle blocker Teresa Skelly pounded home the final kill, earning the Crimson another 25-21 victory.
Penn came back in the fourth set and never allowed Harvard to take the lead, winning, 25-20, and once again tying the match at two wins apiece.
In the final set, the Quakers had a four-point lead at 11-7, but the Crimson was not willing to throw in the towel. Thanks to a 5-0 stretch—highlighted by two blocks from Fryhofer—Harvard gained the upper hand, 13-12. Casey sealed the deal with two consecutive kills, winning the set, 15-13.
“We didn’t make errors in those critical moments,” sophomore setter Natalie Doyle said. “It’s really a testament to how amazing our team’s chemistry is and to how amazing our team is going to be.”
The night was filled with bright spots. Doyle contributed 44 assists and 17 digs, and Fryhofer added seven kills and eight blocks. Skelly also supplied 12 kills and five blocks. Harvard totaled 13 blocks for the night, a second-high season best for the team. Casey ended the night by putting up 19 kills and 22 digs, a career-high in both.
“This win didn’t come from statistics, it came from us playing together,” Doyle said. “We really worked our butts off, and everybody stepped up.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 2
In its first game of the weekend, the Crimson fell to the Tigers, 25-13, 25-21, 21-25, 23-25, 15-9. Harvard started out shakily against Princeton in the first and second sets, dropping both, but was able to reverse the tide of momentum and challenge Princeton, winning the third and fourth set.
“We kind of started off a little slow, not in our system,” Wu said. “We just weren’t playing Harvard volleyball for the first half.”
But after a rough start, the Crimson regrouped and, despite being down 7-2 at the beginning of the third set, Harvard came back, earning five points in a row, tying the game at 10. With an impressive six kills in the frame, Casey helped lead the team to a victory, winning its first set against the Tigers.
“We’re proud that we were able to pick it up and not … give up,” Wu said.
With new confidence, the Crimson entered the fourth set ready to fight. Although Harvard trailed Princeton, 16-6, at one point during the game, the Crimosn kept it together, taking a 10-2 point stretch to close the gap in the score. Freshman outside hitter Tara MacLean and junior outside hitter Taylor Docter contributed four and five kills, respectively, to the set. Docter finished the game by scoring two kills in the last three points, tying up the showdown between the Crimson and the Tigers at two sets each.
The deciding factor came down to the fifth and final set, but Harvard failed to overcome the strength of the Princeton onslaught that culminated in a match victory.
Sophomore Erin Cooney, who recorded 10 kills, Casey, who added 11 kills and three aces, and Docter, who put up a season-high of 18 kills, led the Crimson offense. Doyle stepped in for junior setter Beth Kinsella, who suffered a season-ending injury, to post a career-best 51 assists for the match.
“It was a smooth transition,” Doyle said. “I felt prepared because I had been setting in practice, and I knew what game plan we wanted to follow, and my team really has my back.”
Harvard heads to Brown and Yale next weekend to continue its Ivy play.
“We can’t underestimate Brown … and Yale is always one of the top competitors. We know we can take them and stick with them,” Wu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s golf team’s victorious streak came to an abrupt stop this weekend at the 35th Annual Nittany Lion Women’s Invitational Tournament.
After winning the previous two tournaments, the Crimson tied for ninth place with Ivy rival Yale. The team finished the two rounds at +48 on the par-72 Blue Course in State College, Pa. Fifteen schools competed in the tournament.
“It was a tough weekend, coming off of what we’ve done the first two weeks,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Expectations are going to be high with every tournament you play after that, and it’s hard to be consistently great.”
“This weekend was definitely a struggle for us,” freshman Tiffany Lim added.
Overall, there were little problems that became magnified throughout the tournament: an early ending, the weather, and putting trouble.
Round three was cancelled early Sunday morning, ending the tournament and Harvard’s chances to narrow the gap between it and the leaders. Rain all weekend made the greens flooded in parts and muddy in others.
“We were starting to play with low form, and to make it worse, we didn’t have a chance to make up any ground after the first day,” Rhoads said about the cancelled third round.
The scores from the first two rounds were then finalized (315-309), cementing the Crimson’s standing outside the winner’s circle, a place unfamiliar to the squad this season.
“To finish in the middle of the field was disappointing,” Rhoads said. “We didn’t play well either round.”
The poor conditions and the lack of practice really got to Harvard.
“The first days were cold and rainy,” Lim explained. “It’s just not a ton of fun in the cold rain.”
The women played in 30 and 40 degree weather throughout the weekend. Not only was the team plagued by the rain and cold, but the course also suffered.
The Blue Course, one of Penn State’s challenging greens, has green-side bunkers and fairway bunkers, with water hazards to complicate it.
“The course was saturated,” Rhoads said. “You have to stay mentally strong and muddle your way through the day.”
“It took a lot longer than usual because of the conditions,” added sophomore Bonnie Hu, who is also a member of the Crimson business board.
Friday was a rough start for Harvard, accumulating 315 strokes collectively, with Longwood leading the competition at 294. This set the Crimson at eighth place, an unfamiliar spot for Harvard.
“The second day, we improved as a team,” Hu said. “We were motivated because of our poor first round, and we knew what to expect more with the conditions.”
After the second round on Saturday, Eastern Michigan pulled ahead and won with +21 for the tournament, with Longwood and host Penn State tied for second. Harvard moved down from eighth to ninth place after the second day. The Crimson improved on strokes in day two, but couldn’t make up for the disappointing first day on the course.
“I think it was a combination of not enough practice and fatigue,” Lim said. “That made everybody’s performance a little bit [worse], and those tiny differences will add up.”
Individually, the Harvard golfers didn’t have weekends as great as they did the past two tournaments. Lim finished in a five-way tie for 15th place, +7 for the two rounds. Behind her were sophomore Bonnie Hu in 27th, freshman Brenna Nelsen in 48th, senior Jane Lee in 53rd, and sophomore Julie MacDonnell in 80th.
“I didn’t have a great short game,” Lim said. “That’s where I normally shoot small numbers.”
“If we were making some putts, they easily could have put us in the low 70s or low score of the day,” Rhoads added.
The Crimson will practice putting, chipping, and swings to get back into the winner’s circle.
Despite the loss, Harvard has a lot to look forward to. Tying with Yale and beating the other Ivy in the tournament, Columbia, means that the squad is still performing well in its league. Plus, they have the next week off after playing three tournaments in a row.
“With a weekend off, we need a little bit of rest, make sure we are caught up on school, and have some extra preparation,” Rhoads said.
Based on this weekend’s tournament, the team will look to improve all around.
The Crimson will take advantage of home-course advantage as it prepares for the Harvard Invitational at the Boston Golf Club.
“From now until then, we will try to get as much practice as possible to get familiar with the course,” Hu said.
“I think that after this, we are more committed in what we are doing,” Lim said. “We struggled through this tournament, but learned that we can pick ourselves up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball co-captain Keith Wright was named one of 50 preseason candidates for the John R. Wooden award, given to the country’s best player, the Los Angeles Athletic Club announced today.
Wright, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, joins the likes of North Carolina’s Harrison Barnes, Ohio State’s Jared Sullinger, and Kentucky’s Terrence Jones on the preseason list.
"Truly honored & blessed to be on such a prestigious list w/ so many talented players," Wright said on Twitter this evening. "Wouldn't be there without my teammates & the man above."
The lone representative from the Ivy League, Wright is one of just 12 candidates from outside a Power Six conference.
A traditional post player, the 6’8 forward was a force to be reckoned with in the Ancient Eight during his junior campaign. Wright led the conference in field-goal percentage and averaged 14.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game—good for third and second in the league, respectively.
Wright's entry on a list of assessments of the 50 candidates by opposing coaches (compiled by ESPN.com's Andy Katz) reads as the following: "He is a tremendous back-to-the-basket player. He knows when to pass and when to attack. He has great confidence in his teammates, which helps to make his team better."
But some onlookers expect Wright’s numbers to take a dip this coming season with the return of a healthy Kyle Casey from a foot injury and the addition of three talented freshmen—Kenyatta Smith, Jonah Travis, and Steve Moundou-Missi—to the frontcourt.
Regardless, Wright and the rest of the Harvard men’s basketball team will share the court with two other Wooden Award preseason candidates this coming season when the Crimson travels to UConn to take on the defending national champions Dec. 8.
While the Huskies lost Kemba Walker—the 2011 Wooden Award runner-up—to the NBA, they return a talented lineup led by sophomore Jeremy Lamb and junior Alex Oriakhi, both preseason candidates.

The current comp class for the Flyby Blog got together this past Sunday for its weekly Seminar Meeting, only to realize that it was simply too beautiful a day, with too many enticing sounds and smells, to stay inside. The compers broke into groups and headed to Oktoberfest, where interviews were conducted and pictures were taken. This gallery is the product of their enthusiastic work. We hope it gives you a sense of the festivities that took place this past Sunday.
