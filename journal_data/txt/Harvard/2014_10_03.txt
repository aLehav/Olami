After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I picture cracking her lovely skull, unspooling her brain, trying to get answers,” says a man as he runs his fingers softly through his beautiful wife’s blond hair. Laying her head on his chest, his wife turns and gives him a look of anger mixed with alarm. The opening scene of David Fincher’s “Gone Girl,” starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, and Neil Patrick Harris, foreshadows the disturbing events about to unfold in this dark, elegantly crafted crime thriller. An adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s best-selling novel, “Gone Girl” explores the unsettling idea that even the closest of people don’t truly know each other. It paints an image of human nature as beautiful and composed on the outside but sinister and ugly on the inside.
Nick Dunne (Affleck) returns home on the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary to discover that his rich, beautiful wife, Amy (Pike) has disappeared. The crime scene at their suburban mansion suggests a brutal abduction, and a police investigation ensues. The film is structured in two parts: the past, narrated by Amy’s diary entries, and the present, in which Nick is living a waking nightmare where he is suspected of murdering his wife. The audience soon comes to see that neither Amy nor Nick’s story can be believed. What makes the film so captivating is that it immediately plunges the audience into the mystery of Amy’s disappearance. By the end, the film brilliantly weaves all the subtle details together and ties up loose ends.
The acting in the film is undoubtedly exceptional. Affleck gives a nuanced performance as Nick, the handsome, laidback husband who is confident but not snobby, charming but not overtly flirtatious. Meanwhile, Amy has it all: beauty, wealth, and sophistication. Together, Nick and Amy are the picture-perfect couple, or so it seems on the surface. Both Affleck and Pike do a phenomenal job of depicting their characters as multidimensional: light and composed on the outside, ugly and bitter within. As the police begin probing around for clues, Nick becomes guarded and secretive about his marriage with Amy. Pike portrays Amy as a classy New York woman with a sense of control over her life, yet she also brings out a childish vulnerability.
Not only is the acting remarkable, but Fincher also manages to capture a mysterious and suspenseful mood throughout the entire film. Set in the small town of North Carthage, Missouri, the setting appears to be an ordinary, quiet suburban neighborhood. Yet something feels off. There is a line of downtown buildings with closed or for sale signs. The houses that line the streets of the neighborhood are huge mansions, but many of them are up for sale and empty. Right from the start, the film creates a mood of apprehension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Moreover, composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, well known for scoring “The Social Network,” team up again in “Gone Girl” to produce a deceptively serene and hauntingly unsettling score. Even in some of the more joyful scenes of the film, Reznor and Ross have managed to produce an uneasy melody that captures the mysterious tone of the film. For instance, the night Nick meets Amy, they pass through a mist of sugar powder as workers unload bags of sugar into a bakery; it is here that they share their first romantic kiss. Playing in the background are deep, soothing xylophone chords mixed with disconcerting machine sounds, which add an ominous, foreboding tone to an otherwise blissful scene.
The only minor negative aspects of the movie were the sparse moments of humor that were added in for comic relief. While they did serve the purpose of breaking the tension, they unnecessarily took away from the darker and mysterious side of the movie. There were a few times when the film felt more like a twisted comedy rather than a psychological thriller.
“Gone Girl” is one of the most highly anticipated movies this fall, and rightfully so. Its acting performances, plot, and suspenseful mood contribute to the film’s excellent adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s bestseller. Throughout the film, the audience will be left speechless and queasy. As for the ending: it will blow you away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 3, 2014, at 10:04 a.m.
On Monday, September 29, the Palestine Solidarity Committee led a “die-in” to memorialize victims of this summer’s violence in Gaza. During the event, a member of the PSC read aloud the names of roughly 900 of the 2,104 Palestinian dead as fellow participants assumed positions of death on the ground. The PSC was also joined by members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance and the Student Labor Action Movement in its effort to mourn lives lost during Operation Protective Edge.
We support the notion of calling attention to the human reality of lives lost in Gaza. We would also like to take this opportunity to condemn the actions of both Hamas and the Israeli government in the conflict, and to lament that all losses of human life in conflict are not given due condemnation and mourning in our Harvard community.
We think the actions of both Hamas and the Israeli Defense Forces deserve nothing but the strongest condemnation.  According to the United Nations, 69 percent of those killed in Gaza were civilians; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered an alternative figure of 52 percent. Irrespective of which number is most accurate, it is clear that an unacceptable proportion of non-combatants was killed. It should be equally clear that both sides share some of the blame, but this fact does not render the actions of the IDF any less objectionable.
In light of the staggering civilian death toll, we support the actions of the Palestine Solidarity Committee and of all student protesters who took part in Monday’s demonstration. The “die-in” simply aimed to do what its name suggests: to call attention to a human tragedy precipitated by the senseless violence of this past summer—violence, it we would like to stress, that was perpetrated by both Israel and Hamas. According to S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation, the protest was “peaceful, civil, and informative;” we cannot but wholeheartedly support such non-violent efforts to draw attention to and spark discourse about the plight of victims of violence around the world.
At the same time, we are disappointed that more human rights abuses are not brought to the attention of the Harvard community by student activists. Israel and Hamas are hardly alone in perpetrating unconscionable acts of violence, and while this fact does not delegitimize Monday’s protest, it should serve as a call to action for students across the university. We hope that the Palestine Solidarity Committee’s example will pave the way for future peaceful activism at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 3, 2014, at 10:37 a.m.
Last Monday, the Palestinian Solidarity Committee (PSC), Progressive Jewish Alliance, and the Student Labor Action Movement engaged in a propagandistic, theatrical performance that claimed to discuss the conflict in Gaza, but did little to portray the nuance of the issue or offer constructive discussion toward a peaceful solution.
We want to make clear that every civilian death is a tragedy. However, the “die-in” went beyond simply commemorating the dead, in tone if not in content. It made no attempt to display any sort of nuance regarding the violence this summer. Rather, the PSC opted for vitriol, writing on its Facebook page that the event commemorated those “massacred by Israel,” and that the “resistance remains steadfast.” The “resistance” seems to be set unambiguously against Israel, rather than the terrorist group governing Gaza, which uses civilian hospitals as wartime command centers and stores rockets in United Nations school buildings. We are further surprised by the lack of attention given by the Palestinian Solidarity Committee to the even greater number of Palestinian victims who have been killed in the Syrian war.
Not only did the event display no level of detail or nuance regarding the situation, but it was also detrimental to the peace process. Such events indirectly elevate Hamas, a group identified by the United States, the European Union, and much of the Western world as a terrorist organization, to the level of a valid player and partner for peace. Hamas, we would all do well to remember, pledges in its founding Charter to annihilate the State of Israel and its leadership refuses to accept a peaceful two-state solution as a viable option.
Moreover, the event made no mention of the fact that hundreds of lives were tragically lost at the direct hands of Hamas. Militants encouraged residents not to flee impending airstrikes, built rocket launchers in heavily populated areas, and even executed Gazans suspected of collaborating with Israel. Hamas, as a central tenet of its strategy, attacks Israeli civilians from both above and below. The organization launched rockets into heavily populated areas of Israel and constructed elaborate networks of tunnels underneath Israeli territory with the sole purpose of attacking and capturing Israelis.
We further lament the fact that the majority of the Crimson (Editorial) staff present on Monday subscribed to that dangerous line of thinking, in which a terrorist group is as equally faulted for violence as the nation it attacks. We certainly do not agree that the actions of both the IDF and Hamas “deserve nothing but the strongest condemnation.” In this instance, there is a clear moral unequivalence between the two warring actors. Condemning both on equal terms equates Hamas, which openly targets civilians, with Israel, a country which, for all its faults, has taken pains to minimize civilian casualties, dropping leaflets in Gaza and phoning civilians prior to striking.
Those most punished by the actions of Hamas have been the civilians of Gaza, and each and every one of their deaths is an absolute tragedy. But to consider Israeli actions akin to “massacre,” as the PSC wrote, or to condemn Israel and Hamas on equal footing, as the Crimson has decided to opine, is both intellectually dishonest and counterproductive to any sort of dialogue intended to promote the sovereignty and security of all people in this region.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I guess it’s kind of strange that I read articles on Buzzfeed that talk about “loving your own body.” In my defense, they do seem to be everywhere. And studying gets boring sometime. So why not read?
Though these articles are usually aimed at those outside my demographic, it is not hard to pick up on the ridiculously positive message. The topic covered in these articles reach farther than the concerns of stressed, bored college students. Individuals in our generation (fat, skinny, or anything in between) are obsessed with trying to establish their own sense of self-worth.
This issues does not deal only with body image. Almost everything about an individual is subject to a feeling of dissatisfaction and, ultimately, meaninglessness. The solution, at least according to Buzzfeed, boils down to looking in the mirror and learning to “love yourself.”
Our society runs with this solution. We seek affirmation of our own importance, whether consciously or not. As a matter of fact, this principle applies to the mass politics of our day. Some apparatchik stands up in front of a crowd and tells them that their problems and issues matter. And then, after the speech is done, said official sticks around to take photos with voters dying to update their Facebook profile.
So begins the cycle of self-affirmation.
When we don’t get that validation from other people–say, at a place where everyone is ridiculously talented in some way–the tendency, understandably, is to sulk. In order to have any kind of productive society, people have to believe that they can contribute something.
Of course, that is a pretty utilitarian view of how societies work. The issue of self-worth deals with people’s emotional and psychological states, not what role they would fulfill in an efficient utopian society. We are better off in a world where people are convinced that they can contribute something.
And yet, the end result oftentimes ends up being tragically ineffective.
The unspoken consequence of self-affirmation–of telling yourself that you are a decent human being– involves the search for your own singularity. In other words, you must be better than others at a certain thing. As a result, the idea of who feels better about themselves becomes a competition in and of itself.
Nobody likes to be a complement. We like to take control of our own destinies and shape the direction in which our lives go. That is why the idea of self-worth is itself so appealing. Finding our individual value apart from the accomplishments of others is a noble undertaking. It is a way to ensure that we find our place and role in the world.
But imagine a world in which everyone is always trying to convince themselves that they’re worth something. There would a lot of existential angst–but that is a topic best left to columnists, not the general populace.
This dialogue can just as easily swing in the opposite directions with reminders of how not awesome we are. Sometimes, our generation as a whole needs to hear that nobody cares what cool places they’ve been to or the awesome things they’ve done. But there are countless others who are keenly aware of the fact that their lives are not that awesome. Chiding, condescending remarks don’t do much for them.
But the danger is that we stay stuck in one place. Like the voters receiving the glad-handing politician’s compliments, we end up getting the things that make us feel better about ourselves. This is part of the reason why people seem concerned with making others think that they are confident in their own skin. We would rather lie to ourselves than acknowledge that we have real areas where we can improve. The fact that we are able to notice our faults is a blessing, not an unwanted consequence of self-awareness.
Life is not about admiring who we are now. Some people would still argue that the best solution is, in today’s vernacular, to “love yourself.” But self-affirmation requires a love that is honest. It acknowledges flaws and mistakes, pointing us to places where we could do better. It seeks improvement, not ego-pruning.
I look in the mirror and see that I don’t like the shape of my body. It’s not a call to love who I am. It’s a call to real improvement, not psychological self-deceit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ad begins ominously.
Under an overcast, evening sky we see the silhouette of the Capitol. “Senators are supposed to be a check and balance on the White House,” a woman’s voice says in a stern tone. The screen cuts to a still frame of Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who’s running against Republican challenger Scott Brown. Her skin and clothing are colored black, white, and grey, with her left eyebrow raised, as if she were a creepy Tim Burton character.
The voice accuses Shaheen of “parroting” President Obama during the debate over the Affordable Care Act, then cuts to a pained father embracing his two young daughters who appear on the verge of tears. Then a visibly upset senior. Then the Tim Burton-esque senator again, this time with her lips pursed, and the capitalized words “Say ‘no’ to Jeanne Shaheen” in the background.
At the end, the source of the ad is revealed, and it’s not Scott Brown’s campaign, or an affiliated political action committee. Rather it’s from the largest, and perhaps most opaque ‘nonprofit’ in the nation today: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Harvard students tend not to have televisions at school, so most probably haven’t seen these political ads that have seeped down into Massachusetts. But this Chamber-paid advertising blitz has even made it onto YouTube, which is how I stumbled upon it in the first place. The Chamber, it turns out, has dumped $1.5 million into the race to our north, just over $1 million promoting Brown, and about $500,000 attacking Shaheen. In the diminutive Granite State, even during a high-profile election, that’s big money, considering Brown only has a total of $1.5 million cash on hand.
Most Cantabrigians, it’s safe to say, disagree with the Chamber’s politics, and the New Hampshire race is a mild example. The Chamber has oft questioned anthropogenic climate change and still refuses to affirm its existence. In 2000, it published the “Environmentalist’s Little Green Book,” which is stuffed with quotes by Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy officials that Chamber workers call “stupid” and “misanthropic.” It’s historically the go-to organization for coal companies trying shear off mountains in Appalachia. And in 2009, the Chamber called for a public hearing with the Environmental Protection Agency, examining the pitfalls of climate science. It will be the “Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century,” said the Chamber’s then-vice president to the Los Angles Times.
The organization has been continuously gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, going so far as to run ads in the Mountain West with a middle-aged man lying awake at night, apparently fretting over the welfare of Big Finance. As part of a New York Times exposé in 2009, in which some of the Chamber’s most significant donors were revealed—(the organization keeps this information secret as a matter of policy)—it was found that Goldman Sachs and Prudential Financial were among the organization’s most generous benefactors during the debate over Dodd-Frank.
If there’s one purpose that ties this political activity together, it’s to make dirty hands clean, offering secret influence to corporations that don’t want to be publicly associated the dubious causes they promote. “I want to give them all the deniability they need,” Tom Donohue, the Chamber’s president, said to the Washington Monthly in 2010.
A third of its funding came from just 19 corporations that year—some of them foreign—and though this ratio changes annually, it’s safe to say that the interests of the chamber are weighted to the top of the economic ladder. And yet, the organization is effective on the grassroots when it pumps money into elections—96 percent of the time for Republicans—partly because of its association with the many thousands of friendly local chambers that count themselves as dues-paying members of the national body. A chamber endorsement “is like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval,” said one Democratic House aide to Time, referencing the fact that many see the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as the local mom-and-pop group down the street, rather than the hardline conservative lobbying giant that it is.
Fortunately, many progressive chambers of commerce realize their role in lending false moral legitimacy to the U.S. Chamber, and the move is on to withdraw, or at least formally denounce, the national body. Locally, the chambers in Needham, Massachusetts, and Manchester, Hudson, and Nashua, New Hampshire, have jumped ship in recent years, among many others in the area.
One might think that green-techie-Marxist-progressive Cambridge would be another likely candidate for withdrawal, especially because Harvard University—the place where the intellectual framework of the CFPB was developed, and where administrators have taken relatively firm stands on the climate—is by far its biggest member, with over 11,000 employees. And, in fairness, the local chamber says it’s a measure they’ve considered. “I’m disappointed by the quality of some of the U.S. Chamber ads,” says Kelly Thompson, CEO and president of the Cambridge Chamber. But, for the time being, she says her organization has decided against such a move, citing the “robust professional development programs” offered by the national body."
Yet as robust as these programs may be, there remains a certain irony: every year Harvard, and the Cambridge community writ large, pumps money into an organization that lobbies against the very values upon which the university, and the city, is built. I don’t know what the Cambridge chamber’s dues to the U.S. Chamber come out to—but it’s clear those “professional development programs” come at a pretty steep price.

The Harvard University Police Department is investigating one burglary and a string of attempted break-ins in the Yard.
During an eventful Thursday morning Harvard Police officers responded shortly before 2 a.m. to four different reports of either attempted entry or unlawful entry, one each at Dudley House, Straus Hall, Wigglesworth Hall, and a fourth location.
While three of these attempts appear to have been unsuccessful, a fourth—at an undisclosed location—resulted in the offender entering an occupied suite and making off with a bag of coins, according to Harvard Police spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
HUPD detectives are focusing specifically on the following description of the suspect: “a white male in his 30s, with light curly hair, and dark clothing (possibly a Bruins jersey.).”
In an advisory to the Harvard community on Thursday night, Catalano also described the three unsuccessful attempts.
“In two of the incidents an unknown offender attempted to gain entry to both Dudley House and Straus Hall by either removing a screen or attempting to open a window,” he wrote.
Catalano added that, in a third incident, a man was reported knocking on the doors of Wigglesworth Hall. When officers responded, the man had fled.
Catalano wrote that it remains unclear if the incidents are connected. Those with information related to the break-ins are advised to call the Department’s investigation division at 617-495-1796.

Alfred W. Tatum, dean of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s college of education, gave a lecture Thursday outlining some possible approaches to improving the reading and writing skills of African-American boys.
In his lecture in front of more than one hundred people in the Graduate School of Education’s Longfellow Hall, Tatum presented his audience with observations from his research concerning what and how African American children are learning.
“When I started asking kids in middle school if they had read a text that they...had a meaningful exchange with, they all said ‘no,’” Tatum said. “So even if you have perfect attendance, something is missing in their classroom.”
Discussing his belief in the “power of text,” Tatum emphasized the role that of classroom reading selections play in engaging African-American boys.
“We have severed the relationships these boys had with their texts, and their reading instruction does not feel legitimate,” he said.
Although Tatum stressed the importance of selecting texts for the classroom that are relatable for African-American students, he warned against choosing readings based solely on issues of cultural or gender identity.
“If it’s up to me as a teacher as to decide which identity I should pay attention to, there’s the probability that I can miss the mark,” he said.
Additionally, Tatum said that teachers should think more carefully about why specific texts are taught, instead of simply asking “are these texts at [the students’] reading level?”
Cornelius Lee, a GSE student who attended the lecture, said that “the issue of African-American boys’ education has become a national conversation,” citing how historically, black men have academically underperformed compared to other groups.
“It’s a conversation that’s long overdue and now that it’s at the forefront, it’s become very fascinating,” Lee said.

EdX will now offer courses geared toward employers and employees in the professional sphere, marking the second move by the platform this fall to target a new audience for its MOOCs.
Anant Agarwal, the platform’s CEO, announced the launch of the new courses on the edX blog Tuesday, writing that the courses “will be offered in a convenient manner, tailored to busy schedules, and will reduce costly travel time and expenses for both.”
Rice University, MIT, and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands will begin offering these professional education courses in 2015. The first of the five courses listed on edX’s website is slotted to begin in Jan. 2015.
“We already have MOOC courses at the college level,” Agarwal said in an interview. “Now with professional ed, we are capping it with courses for continuous learners and executives that want to learn about new technologies and features and applications and so on that are coming out and they can apply to their businesses.”
On Wednesday, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol announced that at this time Harvard will not take part in the professional education program.
In conjunction with the launch of the new courses, edX will will also make available to its partners what it calls a “white label” service, an open platform that an institution can own and brand.
The professional courses are the second initiative edX has launched in the past month aimed at audiences outside of the college course market. Last month, edX announced the creation of its first-ever courses geared toward high school students, which are intended to supplement students’ high school material and prepare them for college classes.
According to Agarwal, unlike most other edX courses, the new professional MOOCs will come with a pricetag. For example, MIT’s “Engaging with Innovation Ecosystems: The Corporate Perspective” costs $1,249 per student, while Rice’s “Basics of Energy Sustainability” costs $495 per student. Revenue from these courses will be shared with edX’s partners.
Additionally employers buying the courses in bulk will be eligible for a discount, Agrawal said.
“We believe that professional education is one blade in our swiss army knife of sustainability,” said Agarwal. “The professional education courses will incur a fee. They will also provide, in many cases, continuing education credit and course licensing models for sustainability.”
Although anyone can sign up for one of edX’s professional education courses, the courses will cater to employers and employees in specific industries.
Kirsten Ostherr, who will be teaching a course at Rice about healthcare in the digital world, said she hopes to engage professionals or aspiring professionals in the medical and healthcare sphere.
“[The course] is really going to be tailored toward people who have a leadership capability in their organization and  who want to use this information and the tools we provide to move their organization into the world of digital health,” Ostherr said.
She added, “There’s a lot of hunger for this content, and there’s not a lot of sources to get it from.”

The Affordable Care Act has been largely successful, but faces a number of political, legal, and economic challenges in the coming years, according to a panel of experts at an event Thursday evening.
The panel, titled “Taking Stock of Health Reform,” drew a crowd of about 100 people to the Tsai Auditorium in CGIS South.
Panelist Jonathan H. Gruber, an MIT Professor and an expert on health economics spoke at length about the right ways to evaluate the success of the ACA, and any health care law. Obamacare, he said, is successful if it is judged according to its goals.
“The goal of the [ACA] was not to fix everything that’s wrong with the U.S. health care system...[but rather] to move towards fixing a large number of problems,” he said, noting that persistence of some health care conundrums does not mean the Act has failed to fix broken insurance markets or make health insurance more affordable.
Panelist Timothy S. Jost, a health law attorney, emphasized that the future of the ACA lies in the hands of the Supreme Court. Cases challenging the act on the basis of religious rights, division of power, and privacy issues, have mostly failed, with the exception of the contraceptive religious liberty cases, Jost explained. However, he added, there are a series of cases pending in federal court which could undermine the success of the ACA.
On a different note, panelist Theda R. Skocpol, a Sociology professor, spoke about the political obstacles the ACA faces. She said that the act is here to stay despite a “radicalized” Republican Party that is still talking about repeal.
The ACA’s future hinges on how state-level and national-level politics unfold during the next two years, Skocpol said. She explained that 23 states have yet to implement the act, despite enormous pressure from businesses, public opinion, and insurance companies to do so. At the federal level, debate between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate will make the ACA an issue of contention in the 2016 Presidential elections.
In response to several questions from the audience about the importance of health care literacy for the ACA’s future success, panelist Linda J. Blumberg, an economist, explained how the act’s target population has reported feeling uncomfortable with the most basic financial jargon related to health care.
She added that the most important obstacle to the ACA’s effectiveness is popular confusion regarding the law.
“What we need is a tremendous amount more [of] hand-holding with financial concepts, and other insurance related concepts…in terms of getting people to understand what they’re buying..and how it’s going to benefit them,” she said.

For Allston residents who have long fought for better transportation to downtown Boston, news earlier this week that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will build a $25 million commuter rail station on Harvard-owned land in the neighborhood brought satisfaction and cautious enthusiasm.
A direct public transportation route from Allston to downtown Boston has been a perennial request in Harvard Allston Task Force meetings and neighborhood planning for years. Allston lies just a few miles from downtown, but residents currently must take a bus to Harvard Square or Commonwealth Ave. near Boston University to get there by public transportation.
As recently as last spring, a station appeared to be off the table.
But under preliminary plans announced Tuesday, that would change by 2020, with the completion of “West Station,” connecting the neighborhood to the existing Framingham/Worcester line, which originates at South Station. The station is to be built on the Beacon Park Rail Yards, which lie south of Cambridge St. and are owned by Harvard.
“We felt it was only right...for us to get a commuter rail station,” said Anthony D’Isidoro, a board member of the Allston Civic Association. He, along with many other Allston residents, described the challenge community members face getting into the city.
“One of the few things about this neighborhood that is challenging is that there isn’t a really direct way to downtown,” long-term Allston resident Joyce Radnor said. “In theory, [the station] is a beautiful thing.”
Allston residents added that many questions about the station remain, including the frequency of trains passing through, pedestrian and bicycle access routes, and the continued commitment to public transportation by state leadership as Massachusetts elects a new governor this fall.
Many of those variables will likely be determined during the planning process for the realignment of the adjacent Massachusetts Turnpike, a $260 million project that made the West Station project possible. The Pike realignment also falls on Beacon Park Rail Yards, a 91-acre parcel of land the University bought in 2003. In addition to the land on which the station will be built, the University is also contributing one third of the project’s cost, around $8 million.
Allstonians said that investment is small compared to the long-term returns it could yield for the University as the two projects free up dozens of Harvard-owned acres for new development.
“A transit station there will hugely increase the value of the land, all of which Harvard owns,” said Jessica B. Robertson, an Allston resident and a member of the task force advising the Massachusetts Department of Transportation on the realignment project.
Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that the University was also a big supporter of the station.
“The obvious enormous benefits the station would bring to the entire community and region, including Harvard students, faculty and staff made a public/private partnership the smart and responsible thing to do,” he wrote in an emailed statement.
Harvard’s current institutional master plan for Allston development in the decade does not include any plans on the land in question.
Still, Radnor said that she believes “given Harvard’s long-term plan [over the next 50 to 100 years], this area will all be Harvard. That rail station certainly helps our neighborhood in the short term, but if I’m Harvard I’m thinking that long term...this is really a benefit to them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of a student-faculty working group convened to address issues of race and inclusion at the College have started meeting for the semester and plan to draft a set of recommendations to present to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana by the end of the academic year, according to Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton.
Walton, who chairs the working group, said the committee met once in May and has continued to meet this semester on the first and third Wednesdays of every month. The first couple of meetings, Walton said, have focused on making sure that the group was “on the same page” and clarifying its mission, which he described as creating “cultures of inclusion” at the College.
The committee will focus on gathering information throughout the fall and look to implement some test projects in the spring, Walton said. The group’s end goal is to produce a “set of concrete recommendations...for practices, for thinking about how we allocate resources” and for “additional activities, programs, and services we can undertake to continually enhance our sense of inclusion on this campus,” said Khurana, who convened the group last spring.
That semester, a social media campaign about black students’ experiences on campus titled “I, Too, Am Harvard” attracted international attention and sparked increased campus discourse about race and diversity. Khurana said he expects socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity to be among the topics the working group discusses, but “there could be others,” he added.
The group’s membership includes several African and African American Studies professors, including department chair Lawrence Bobo, as well as Executive Director of the Harvard University Native American Program Shelly C. Lowe, men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, Assistant Dean for Dversity Relations and Communications Robert Mitchell, and three undergraduates. One of the undergraduates, Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, wrote and directed “I, Too, Am Harvard.”
Former Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, who convened the working group with Khurana last spring, said he is not involved with the committee. Khurana is not sitting on the group.
Josephine M. Kim, a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education and a member of the group, said she hopes to bring a unique perspective to the committee’s work as a person of Asian descent.
“I’m excited to be on the committee to hopefully be able to bring a voice that might not exist otherwise,” she said.
So far, the working group has divided itself into three subcommittees. Kim said each subcommittee will focus on studying one of three sources—peer institutions, other schools at Harvard, and students and student groups at the College. The subcommittees will be looking to consider “best practices” for creating an inclusive environment on campus and to hear from students about their needs.
Pforzheimer House Master Anne Harrington ’82, who sits on the working group, will lead the subcommittee that will reach out to current Harvard undergraduates. Her group met this week and plans to run focus groups and meet with student leaders, she wrote in an email.

Adding to the cultural and culinary diversity of the Square, Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, a traditional ramen restaurant originally native to Japan, is slated to open in late 2014 or early 2015.
The eatery will be located at 1 Bow St., the former location of a Dunkin’ Donuts. According to Miho Suyama, who works in store development and marketing at Santouka, this location will be the franchise’s second stand-alone restaurant in the U.S., joining over 50 other locations in Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, and around the world.
“We were searching the whole area...but Harvard is such a good place,” said Suyama, noting that unlike New York, Boston has relatively few Ramen restaurants. “There’s a lot of people from other countries [in Cambridge]. Also around that area, it’s easy to get people to try other cultures because it’s around the university [and part of the] culture.”
Suyama said that the broth for Santouka’s ramen will be made fresh every day, replicating the broth that the company sells in Japan. However, she added, the menu of each franchise location varies from region to region to incorporate local ingredients.
Though Suyama said that the business hours of the restaurant are still undecided, she said that the company will try to accommodate the preferences of its Harvard Square customers.
Jeremiah P. Murphy Jr. ’73, president of the Harvard Coop and the manager of a company which owns the property on 1 Bow St., said he anticipated an opening date near the end of December or the beginning of Jan. 2015. According to Murphy, the deal to lease the space to Santouka was finalized over the last few months.
“We looked at several different potential people to go in there and from our point of view [Santouka] had both the best concept with what’s going on in Harvard Square and what meets the community needs,” Murphy said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she expects Santouka to be a great addition to the Square.
“Noodles are a very attractive food item for students in particular because they tend to be hot, delicious and affordable. Students love them, so no matter where they go they will enliven the area,” she said.
Students, too, have expressed eagerness about the prospect of ramen in the Square.
“I love ramen; it’s one of my favorite Japanese foods,” Hao-Kai Pai ’16 said. “I found out about this new restaurant on Facebook. Someone shared it, and I saw it, and then I shared it, too. I’m pretty excited.”

A task force commissioned last spring to address sexual misconduct on campus is actively collaborating with peer institutions to create a “climate survey”—set to be distributed to the Harvard community in the spring—to gauge the circumstances in which unwanted sexual advances occur, according to the group’s chair Steven E. Hyman.
University President Drew G. Faust announced the creation of the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault in April amid increased national and on-campus attention on the issue last semester. A month later, the group issued a set of early recommendations regarding funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and sexual assault prevention training during orientation programs.
The work of the task force overlaps with the rollout of the first University-wide sexual assault policy, which was announced in July.
While Hyman referred to the group’s initial recommendations as “obvious early fixes,” he said the upcoming survey—the task force’s central focus—has proved more challenging.
“I was sort of naive going into the process in that I imagined...that there were really good instruments already designed to elicit responses,” Hyman, former University Provost, said. “But in fact, as we looked pretty deeply into it...we realized that the existing instruments were not going to do the job.”
As an example of the difficulties in interpreting the drivers and incidence of sexual assault, Hyman cited increased reports of sexual misconduct, which could reflect higher rates of misconduct or an improved reporting system, among other factors.
Working with peer institutions from the Association of American Universities, Hyman said, will help the task force develop a more rigorous set of survey questions as well as better understand how other schools are addressing the issue of sexual misconduct, both through pre-survey discussions and ultimately comparison of survey results across institutions.
“Harvard has sometimes had a tendency to go it alone, but here I really do think we have to learn from each other,” Hyman said.
Two members of the task force, Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88 and Director of University Health Services Paul J. Barreira, are preliminarily involved in a committee across public and private institutions in the AAU to develop the survey’s common core, according to Hyman. Laibson was out of the country and unavailable for comment.
In addition, Faust attended an AAU meeting on sexual assault last spring and said in September that she has talked to members of the AAU, including the president of Brown University, about sexual assault and climate survey design.
“We're trying to figure out how to align ourselves with other institutions,” she said.
Hyman said that the task force will gather student perspectives on sexual assault in November and add University-specific questions to the survey core before launching it in the spring. He added that the task force will release a report based on the survey results in fall 2015 and aims to make the results “really public.”
“[Sexual misconduct] is damaging of lives, damaging of people's opportunities to get educated,” he said. “It's really important that...in the testimony that we'll be getting later this fall, in the research we're doing...and in interpreting survey results both internally and externally, we really try to understand how they guide us toward preventative intervention.”

Vice President Joseph R. Biden talked foreign policy, the future of the United States, and the ‘bitch’ of being a vice president during a speech at the Institute of Politics on Thursday evening, the focal point of his first official visit to campus since taking office in 2009.
Biden took his eager audience around the world in his remarks, addressing key issues ranging from ISIS to the Ebola outbreak in Africa to energy independence. He also met privately with students in a study group led by his sister, IOP fellow Valerie Biden Owens, earlier in the day and after the speech took questions from students for almost an hour. He was eventually urged away from the microphone by Dean of the Kennedy School of Government David T. Ellwood.
In his formal speech, the Vice President focused his remarks on what it’s going to take for America to succeed in the beginning of 21st century when it comes to foreign policy. He stressed the need for a global response to critical issues in the Middle East, China, and Ukraine.
“International order is literally frayed at the seams,” Biden said early in the speech. “The challenges we face today require collective response.”
He went through key strategic points for maintaining America’s strength around the world, such as shoring up core alliances, confronting violent extremism, and building a strong international economy. He also addressed some more controversial issues, becoming visibly impassioned about immigration reform.
“The single most significant thing we can do to fundamentally change the relationship [with immigrants] in terms of trust and commitment is to pass immigration reform,” Biden said.
Despite emphasizing the urgency of issues such as instability in the Middle East and immigration reform, Biden, a self-described optimist, put international crises into perspective, telling the audience that America is safe.
“The U.S. faces threats that require attention, but we face no existential threat to our way of life or security,” he said. Referencing the Boston Marathon bombings, he added later, “Americans will never ever stand down; we endure, we overcome, we own the finish line, so do not take out of proportion this threat.”
After his official remarks, the teleprompter turned off, and Biden stepped out from behind the podium and into the Q & A session. College and Kennedy School students asked questions on topics ranging from human rights to Turkey to AIDS funding. He reminded students that international collaboration is not solely the job of today’s dignitaries.
“Folks, people in other parts of the world are just as smart as you, just as good and decent as you,” Biden said. “Stop that attitude ‘What can I do for you?’ It’s ‘What can I do with you?’”
When Sietse K. Goffard ’15 introduced himself as the Undergraduate Council Vice President , Biden interjected, “Isn’t it a bitch?” to raucous laughter from the audience. Biden quickly clarified that he was joking.
After answering questions for 30 minutes longer than planned, Biden was cut off by Ellwood. He then motioned for those who still had questions to come up and ask them personally, at which time a crowd of students surrounded him, discussing foreign policy and snapping selfies.
“I feel like the speech was very formal, very ‘U.S. rah rah’ because he sort of has to do that,” Timothy H. Shea ’18 said. “The good old Biden shows up when he’s asked questions and responds. He’s still one of the most genuine politicians I’ve ever heard speak.”
“He wants us to not give up on America. He wants to make sure we are still confident in our country, confident in our leadership, confident in our ability,” Osaremen F. Okolo ’17 said.
According to IOP spokesperson Esten Perez, more people entered the lottery for Thursday’s event than any other in the Institute’s history. The forum fits 750 people.
Law enforcement officials and secret service closed off JFK St. to all vehicular traffic between Eliot St. and Memorial Dr. from noon to 8 p.m. Trucks, police cars, and secret service vehicles lined the streets as attendees were forced to enter the Kennedy School from the John F. Kennedy Park.
Earlier in the day, Biden had attended an event for the Democratic National Committee in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eliot House Committee leaders agreed midday Thursday to allow their proposed budget to be published by the Undergraduate Council alongside other House committee budgets, in accordance with the Council’s bylaws.
The decision followed a tense debate with the Council’s president, Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 over its ability to require the HoCo to submit a detailed budget and the potential of withholding funding if they did not. Eliot HoCo leaders said they were worried that their budget, if released publicly, could breed negative perceptions about the House.
At the center of the dispute was a piece of UC legislation passed last spring mandating that House Committees submit detailed budgets revealing all sources of income by Oct. 1 in order to be eligible for UC funds, which typically amount to $12,000 per House. The legislation mandated that those budgets then be posted to the UC’s website behind a password-protected portal accessible to any Harvard undergraduate.
By 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, the night before the submission deadline, the UC had received budgets from all 12 Houses, including Eliot. Eliot’s budget was eventually rejected, however, because it contained insufficient detail, according to Mayopoulos.
At 10:30 pm, Mayopoulos and Eliot representatives, including HoCo Chairs Megan B. Prasad ’15 and Tommy Chen ’15, Eliot HoCo treasurer Ozdemir Vayisoglu ’16, non-resident tutor Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14 and two other Eliot representatives, met in a room in Eliot House to outline their concerns, and, with $12,000 for student activities and events on the line, attempted to hash out an agreement before the midnight deadline.
The group ultimately reached a conditional agreement. Mayopoulos received the Eliot HoCo budget shortly after the meeting, around 11:45 pm, but said he would not look at it until receiving a confirmation from the representatives the following day. In the meantime, those representatives could confer with House administrators for a second opinion on whether to decide to retract the document without Mayopoulos, or any other students, ever seeing it, according to Mayopoulos. He said he gave the representatives until 2 p.m. to decide and both parties left the meeting calmly.
Chen and Vayisoglu declined to comment on whether there were any stipulations or strings attached to the budget sent to Mayopoulos Wednesday night. Biblarz, who was present at the meeting and represented Eliot on the UC before he graduated, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
At around 1 p.m. Thursday, Mayopoulos said he received confirmation that Eliot did not wish to retract their budget and thus would allow it to be made publicly available.
Requests by The Crimson to view Eliot’s budget were denied by both Mayopoulos and Prasad. All House budgets, including Eliot’s, however, will be uploaded on the UC’s website in the next few days, Mayopoulos said.
Though their budget was ultimately submitted, Eliot HoCo leaders maintain that the UC has overstepped its role, communicated ineffectively in the past, and made decisions without the  input of the House committees.
“It’s not that we want to hide what we’re spending,” Prasad said in an interview Thursday. Rather, she said, Eliot students she spoke with were concerned about the budget fostering unproductive and inaccurate comparisons among Houses by freshmen in particular.
“Pure numbers don’t reflect the reality,” Prasad said.
Had they not reached an agreement Wednesday night, she said, Eliot House representatives were considering the possibility of asking residents to opt out en masse of the Undergraduate Council Student Activities fee, which funds the vast majority of the UC’s budget.
“If [the] UC decided not to give us our money, Eliot students would have a good reason to opt out, and, in that case, probably the UC would lose more than $12,000,” Vayisoglu said. Prasad stressed that nobody wanted to resort to this response.
Eliot House Co-Master Gail A. O’Keefe predicted that about 75 percent of Eliot residents would have opted out of the fee, and said Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich had provided information about how students might waive the fee. The deadline for waiving the fee was Sept. 30, however, according to the Student Receivables Office’s website.
Mayopoulos, while lauding the agreement reached with Eliot, criticized the prospect of such a response.
“Any student group, including a House, could tell their members to not pay the UC fee,” he said. “But I'm not sure why any HoCo would choose to hide its budget from the rest of the school, choose to opt out of the UC funding, and would then encourage its residents not to pay a fund that supports all student groups and activities. I don't think that’s in the spirit of community.”
Eliot HoCo leaders, on the other hand, contend that the circumstances surrounding the spring legislation mandating the budget disclosure in the first place are cause for concern.
“The way that the legislation happened was something that really upset us because this wasn’t a process that we were involved in,” Prasad said. She added that when Eliot reached out to voice their opinion last year, their “concerns were completely disregarded.”
O’Keefe questioned the ability of the UC to place demands on House Committees in the first place.
“The Hoco and all of the HoCos are autonomous bodies,” O’Keefe said. “They’re not beholden to the UC. HoCos were established to be the liaison between the students and the House masters...so for them to be having any say over our budget...there’s no basis for it.”
Mayopoulos disagreed, arguing that the UC is committed to transparency, and that students deserve to compare sources of revenue across all Houses.
“As the distributor of student money, the UC has a responsibility to make sure that we know where the money is going, and that it’s going towards groups that are using the money effectively for students,” he said.
Still, he characterized Eliot’s concerns as “very reasonable,” saying he doesn’t think Eliot students should be judged on their HoCo finances alone. According to Mayopoulos, they use “innovative” measures and work “very hard” to secure funding.
Despite past tension, both Eliot HoCo and Mayopoulos said they hope to continue discussing unresolved concerns in the future and are happy for the time being that they were able to reach an agreement on budget disclosure.
Notwithstanding any problems discovered under further review, all House committees will receive their funding in the next week, according to Mayopoulos.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Efficiency. I’m a fan.
So with the University administration asking for student thoughts on the General Education program and fans wondering about the state of the Ivy League, I figured I would help both at the same time.
Without further ado, here is a breakdown of all eight Ivy teams (six play their first league game Saturday) and which Gen Ed course each would be. Picks for each game this weekend are below.
Brown (0-2, 0-1 Ivy) – Empirical & Mathematical Reasoning 17: Deductive Logic. Given the fact that the Bears have to replace 11 starters on offense, and knowing they were only a middle-of-the-pack team last year, it makes sense that Brown has started the year 0-2. If EMR 17 doesn’t fit its schedule, the Bears also look like a perfect match for EMR 14: Fat Chance.
Columbia (0-2, 0-0) – Ethical Reasoning 11: Human Rights. Is it ethical to beat the Lions 402-73, as the 10 teams who faced Columbia did combined last year? The Light Blue appears fated for a similar string of embarrassments this year after 49-7 and 42-7 losses to Fordham and Albany, respectively.
Cornell (0-2, 0-0) – Science of the Physical Universe 26:  Primitive Navigation. After losing NFL hopeful quarterback Jeff Mathews to graduation, the Big Red appears lost and its road through the desert of irrelevance appears long.
Dartmouth (1-1, 0-0) – Culture and Belief 30: Seeing is Believing. Is the Big Green for real? A week 10 upset of Princeton to finish 2013 vaulted them into consideration among the conference’s best, but they will have to prove the offense can replace Dominick Pierre. With Penn and Harvard—the only Ivy teams to beat Dartmouth last year—going to Hanover this season, the Big Green has no excuses. It is show-me time.
Harvard (2-0, 1-0) – Societies of the World 19: Western Ascendancy—The Mainsprings of Global Power from 1400 to the present. The Crimson has not ruled the Ancient Eight for 600 years, but it feels like it has. Harvard has claimed a league-high six conference titles since 2001 and the Crimson has won 82 percent of its conference games during that stretch.
This year, the Crimson’s biggest threat to continued success appears to be itself, as injuries to senior quarterback Conner Hempel and junior running back Paul Stanton have led to a slow start. If the two can get healthy by the midway point of the season, look for Harvard to maintain its place near the top of the pecking order.
Princeton (1-1, 0-0) – Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 57: American Dreams. What is more American than eating clubs and being the richest University per student? A lot? Oh, well how about rags-to-riches stories and unfettered greed? No self-respecting screenwriter would cast Princeton students in a tale of social mobility, but this year’s seniors started their Princeton careers by going 1-9 in 2011. They improved to 5-5 in 2012 and then earned a share of the Ivy title with an 8-2 mark last season.
Like any good American, Princeton is now dreaming of more. And with Ivy League Player of the Year quarterback Quinn Epperly returning, the Tigers have a good shot at repeating.
Pennsylvania (0-2) – Culture and Belief 35: Classical Mythology. The Quakers appeared immortal in the Ivy League, winning six titles in an 11-year stretch ending in 2003. They have won just three championships since then and a 3-4 Ivy record last year has them back in the middle of the pack. Starting 0-2 this season does not bode well for the ending of the Legend of Al Bagnoli in the coach’s final season. Given its recent struggles, Penn also qualifies as Study of the Past.
Yale (2-0, 0-0) – Science of the Physical Universe 18: Time. As in it’s about damn time. After a six-year stretch of ordinary, the Bulldogs have made a strong argument for being back—starting 2-0 and beating FBS-opponent Army to get there. Running back Tyler Varga will be tough to deal with as long as he stays healthy and quarterback Morgan Roberts showed his potential by throwing for 376 yards and four scores in week one.
On to the picks.
HARVARD AT GEORGETOWN
Long considered an academic competitor to the Ivy League, Georgetown is not quite at the Crimson’s level on the football field. Even with its offense limited by injury, Harvard should manage to dispatch Georgetown in time to see the sights.
Prediction: Harvard 24, Georgetown 10
YALE AT CORNELL
The toughest part of the weekend for the Bulldogs will be locating Ithaca, N.Y. Assuming they find it, Roberts and Varga should have a field day as the Big Red continue to put the L’s in Cornell.
Prediction: Yale 38, Cornell 17
PRINCETON AT COLUMBIA
This score will be whatever the Tigers want it to be. I’ve already written more words than points the Lions will score, so I’ll stop.
Prediction: Princeton 59, Columbia 7
BROWN AT RHODE ISLAND
Ah, the famous battle for the Governor’s Cup fought between the 0-2 Bears and the 0-4 Rams. Does it get more Rhode Island than that?
Prediction: Brown 23, Rams 19
PENNSYLVANIA AT DARTMOUTH
This game is the most interesting of the weekend, and it should be the best. Last year, the Quakers escaped, 37-31, in quadruple-overtime. Look for Dartmouth to beat Penn for the first time since 2007 Saturday (though the last five contests have been decided by an average of 5.6 points) with a stingy defense and just enough big plays from junior quarterback Dalyn Williams.
Prediction: Dartmouth 20, Penn 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting its Ivy League slate with a 22-14 win over Brown last Saturday, the Harvard football team (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) showed why it was picked to finish near the top of the conference this preseason. But this Saturday, the Crimson faces a new challenge in Georgetown (2-3, 0-1 Patriot), an opponent Harvard has never played in its 141-year history.
Harvard will have to play without senior starting quarterback Conner Hempel, who has been forced to sit out after injuring his back.
Instead, the Crimson will be looking to junior Scott Hosch to lead them to victory, as he did in a fourth-quarter comeback against Brown last weekend. In Hosch’s Ivy League debut, he completed a nine-yard pass to junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer for the Crimson’s first touchdown. Later he himself scored by running three yards into the Brown’s end zone. Hosch also had a completion percentage of 70.9 percent, passing for 234 yards.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he is confident that Hosch will be able to deliver another solid game against Georgetown. Despite Hosch’s lack of experience on the field, Murphy expressed great faith in his smarts, instincts, and understanding of his role in the offense.
As Hosch put it, “My job as quarterback is simple: just trust the other guys and get them the ball.”
Hosch also said that while dominating the Ivy League is a prominent goal, the Crimson isn’t going to take other competitors—such as Georgetown—lightly.
“We play every game to win,” Hosch said. “We want to reach our full potential each week and play better than we did the week before.”
Murphy echoed the values of teamwork and effort, reiterating that he trusts his players to make smart, advantageous plays to help the team progress.
“I really like…the grit we’ve displayed at times in terms of people stepping up for injured guys and having to come back in the second half in a couple games,” Murphy said.
One of the Harvard offense’s biggest challenges this game will be getting past Georgetown senior defensive end Alec May, who had eight tackles and one sack in Georgetown’s last game against Colgate, a 19-0 loss. May, a Massachusetts native, has started for the Hoyas since his freshman year, and he was named to the All-Patriot League second team in 2013.
The Georgetown team itself is on a two-loss streak, and will be looking to get back on its feet. The Hoya defense has proven strong, as Georgetown has not allowed more than 23 points in a game.
“They’re a good defensive football team,” Murphy said. “They’re tough, they handled Brown, they did a great job against Colgate and because of it, they’ve been able to hang in there and compete with everybody they play.”
But the Harvard team is prepared for new rivals.  Captain Norman Hayes emphasized the importance of watching film and getting to know the strengths and weaknesses of Georgetown’s game. This diligence is a routine for the Crimson.
“Our preparation remains the same week in and week out,” Hayes said. “It’s nothing new.”
Although Harvard does not have the familiarity benefit playing Georgetown every year, the film from the Brown-Georgetown game two weeks ago has provided insight as to how Georgetown has played another member of the Ivy League. Georgetown won that game, 17-3, exemplifying its strong defense and future potential.
But beyond the challenge of waiting for Hosch and the Crimson offense, Harvard’s defense is focusing on improving its game as well. Hayes, who plays safety, articulated his goals for the defense, and his expectation that “everyone understand their responsibilities, rally behind each other, pick each other up, and make sure we finish the game strong.”
This game has many purposes for the Harvard football program: to reach out to alumni, to attract recruits, and to give the team experience playing different opponents. But also, this game presents an opportunity  for the team to improve.
The Crimson has already shown that it can hold its own in the Ivy League, establishing itself as a serious competitor for the championship title this year. But, as Murphy pointed out, a winning score is not the ultimate goal.
“We want to win,” Murphy said. “But beyond that we want to improve.”

There used to be a time when October 3rd was just a regular day. That all changed in 2004 when "Mean Girls" was released, and it became known as the day Aaron Samuels asked Cady Heron what day it was. So what can you do to commemorate the most iconic movie of our time? Here are some do’s and don’ts for celebrating the best day of the year.
Do: Wear Pink
You already wear pink on Wednesdays (or at least you should). But everyone’s allowed to break the rules, right? If you don’t have any pink clothes, you can try Sears.
Don’t: Make Your Status “It’s October Third”
The limit to this DOES exist. If you see more than three people on your newsfeed with this status, don’t add on to it. Every celebration can be overdone, and you don’t need to ruin this glorious day.
Don’t: Hook Up with Your Friend’s Ex
Regardless of how attractive he may be, or how hard you pregamed, your friend’s ex is strictly off limits. That’s just, like, the rules of feminism.
Do: Watch “Mean Girls”
This one’s a given. The College Events Board is having its annual screening in the Science Center tonight. Much more fun than watching in your room, since you can bond with all the other people who have felt personally victimized by Regina George. It’ll be totally grool.
Happy October 3rd! It’ll be so fetch!

It’s finally Friday! It's been a long and sleep-deprived week for everyone, and in case you're in desperate need of looking at something other than textbooks, practice problems, and classnotes that don't make sense because you fell asleep during lecture, here are some highlights from Twitter this week:
Can we talk about how good the kale dumplings were from HUDS this week?

IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The weather’s actually going to be nice today! It’s going to be sunny with a high of 61 degrees. There’s a 20% chance of precipitation at night, but that’s infinitely better than the rainy sadness that’s been the past two days. The weekend’s going to be a mix of different weather though– it’ll be rainy on Saturday and sunny on Sunday.

2) Experts Examine Challenges Facing Affordable Care Act: "The Affordable Care Act has been largely successful, but faces a number of political, legal, and economic challenges in the coming years, according to a panel of experts at an event Thursday evening.
