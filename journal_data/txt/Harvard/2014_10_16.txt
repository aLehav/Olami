After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A daughter brings home her fiancé to meet her parents, a somewhat ordinary event for most American families. Yet for the Newquist family, no event is ordinary. Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Little Murders,” running from Oct. 17 to Oct. 25, is a dark comedy about a girl, Patsy Newquist, and her dysfunctional family. As the play unfolds, a deceptively harmless evening soon spirals out of control as the violence and crime from the exterior world, which become increasingly more prominent, seep into the Newquist family life.
The production juxtaposes a seemingly innocuous inside world with a violent outside. “The play takes place in a world where you don’t go out on the street for fear of losing your life, you question whether you are safe at all times. Not a day goes by where someone you know doesn’t get thrown down on the street,” Mark J. Maureillo ’15 says.
While the play deals with dramatic, serious themes, the show’s zany characters bring a perverse, black humor to the show. “The Newquists are the wackiest and strongest nuclear family that you could ever find. It’s like the Brady bunch on steroids,” Mauriello says.
Although the original play takes place in the 1960s, this production takes place in a futuristic society. A part of the HRDC’s Visiting Director’s Project, “Little Murders” is directed by Shira Milikowsky, who had the imagination to add few unique twists to the play, playing with gender in “Little Murders.” “We’ve actually cast a female performer, Elizabeth K, Leimkuhler ’15, as Carol Newquist, the father, and a male performer, Mark Mauriello, as Marjorie, the mother, which sets up an interesting dynamic and adds a really cool extra dimension to the humor of the play,” assistant director  Joey R. Longstreet ’16 says.
This revival of “Little Murders” is strikingly different from any other production of the play. “We are performing this play in a radically different way,” notes Longstreet. According to co-executive producer Magdalene M. Zier ’16, “Little Murders” goes above and beyond student expectations as the only professionally directed show on campus this season: “This play is taking it to the next level because Shira has obviously worked with all professional staff in the past, and so her expectations are definitely higher and more professionally focused.”
Ultimately, “Little Murders” is a play that audiences can relate to on a personal level. “I hope that audiences don’t see the Newquists as that different from themselves,” says Longstreet. “It’s a satirical portrait of the American family, and the play itself has a lot to say about America in 2014.”

Ebola was first identified in 1976, after an outbreak in present-day South Sudan killed 150 people. In the years since, outbreaks of the disease have flared every few years, ravaging entire villages before quarantines successfully contained the virus. But the current outbreak has been different—over 4,000 people have been killed in the largest Ebola outbreak in history, and at least 17 cases of Ebola have been treated outside of West Africa.
The unprecedented pace of the disease could have been halted much earlier had the international community’s response not been so slow until now.
Patient zero is believed to be a two-year-old boy who died in Guinea on December 6, 2013. It wasn’t until three months later in March 2014, that the World Health Organization, which has suffered from drastic budget cuts and staff layoffs, announced a major Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Even if public health officials were slow to diagnose the outbreak, little could have been done without the support of the international community in providing medical equipment, doctors, and expertise.
So little was being done even by September that President Obama bluntly stated, “We are not moving fast enough. We are not doing enough,” at a United Nations meeting last month.
Now that two American health workers in Dallas, Texas, have contracted the disease from a Liberian patient, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working frantically to keep Ebola from spreading. The president cancelled a trip to convene a cabinet meeting to discuss the deadly virus and the public’s increasing fears.
Of course, the disease must be treated seriously, but the sudden rush to screen, quarantine, and develop experimental treatments ought to prompt reflection and reform of the sorry state of public health funding that brought the world to the brink.
Rushing experimental treatments only when a public health crisis threatens the Western world is not a viable state of affairs—research funding, which has been heavily hit by Congress’s sequestration, ought to develop cures and treatments for all diseases, whether they affect Africans or Americans.
As America spends nearly $500 million to train and arm Syrian rebels, public health initiatives, like American funding to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, are receiving less and less. The WHO has been hobbled by cuts, and received more in 2013 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation than from any single country.
If there is any area in world affairs that requires American leadership, it is in fighting and preventing disease. International apathy to all but major epidemics simply won’t do.

CS50 has finally, tragically reached Mather House. Office hours on Thursday nights take place in our dining hall, which is so unfortunate for everyone involved because we at Mather aren’t particularly fond of the swarm of desperate students who descend upon us and they usually take a half hour to figure out where Mather even is. Those who didn’t venture over to our dining hall last week were kept fully apprised of the situation via an email thread creatively titled: “Oh my god, CS50.” Here are a few selected emails: “Everyone….beware!!! There’s no water too ;-(.” “There’s really not any water?!?” “I heard they refilled it or something….Someone should check and share.”
There are really only three explanations justifying a thread like that. One: Everyone in Mather sending emails was high on something or other (possible but not likely). Two: The entire Cambridge reservoir ran out of water, and the city went dry (again, possible but not likely). Three: The drink fountains were turned off.
But more importantly, I was struck by the sheer number of people taking CS50, a record high. The crowd belies a larger trend, one that has been much discussed and sometimes maligned, a shift away from the humanities toward math and science and computer programming and management. On some level the trend seems hypocritical. The whole point of these fields, as far as I can tell, is to make our work more efficient.  If we develop advanced enough computers and decode how the economy ticks and learn how to manage businesses better, then we can produce more while working less.
But in all the hype about a more productive economy, we lose sight of the end goal. Our newfound speed should allow us to focus more on the arts and literature. It should allow us to focus more on philosophy. It should allow us to focus more on community. It should allow us to focus on everything except our own personal GDPs. Instead, we measure, in the words of Robert F. Kennedy, “neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to country… everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”
Which is a bit of an overstatement. Besides, I get it, I really do get it, being an economics concentrator myself. We have student loans to pay back, and booze to buy, and I’ll be damned if I can’t give my kids the same opportunities my parents could afford to give me. So we study math and sciences and engineering, so we can get jobs that pay well once we graduate. Besides, there are only so many times you can listen to a literary analysis in English class contain the word “heteronormativity” before you either punch yourself repeatedly in the face or switch your concentration to computer science.
Yet many of us have completely narrowed our focus to math and science and computer science, and maybe we ought to give the humanities, and everything else, at least a second glance. We’re on a relentless drive to do everything better, faster, more streamlined, made of 1s and 0s. Which is important, to a point. Except nowadays, when we slow down for a minute or two, it’s not to read a book or paint a picture or even throw our plates away (looking at you, freshmen). No; when we take a moment to breathe, it usually involves six-second videos and 140-character messages, both of which tend to involve cats.
So here I am, watching the poor soul furiously typing and trying to track down a TF able and willing to provide some help. It’s like a pinball machine, except there are 875 balls and no goals, and the entropy level just keeps increasing. We all really ought to calm down. The way I figure it, if we’re going to run around like a bunch of headless chickens, we ought to run around like a bunch of calm, collected headless chickens. And if you’re going to spend your nights coding, you damn well better be making apps to enhance the quality of our cat videos.
Then go read a book.
And also, please, if you’re going to drink all the water, do it somewhere other than Mather.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric Holder’s departure from the Justice Department has sparked renewed interest in one of the great pieces of unfinished business left to his successor: the United States military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There, 79 prisoners cleared for release languish because no countries—not even the one that wrongfully imprisoned them—will take them. Several dozen more have yet to be tried on the crimes for which they have been locked up. And Congress has shamefully decided that ending these extra-constitutional detentions would be politically foolish, choosing to block any move to transfer Guantanamo prisoners to American soil for trial or any other purpose.
President Obama might finally be growing a backbone on the issue. The Wall Street Journal reported that he may ignore the Congressional prohibition on prisoner transfer, a decision he should have made years ago. His administration has long maintained that Congress’s law is “an … encroachment on the authority of the executive branch.” Put more bluntly, the prohibition is obdurately stupid. As Obama’s anger translator Luther from the comedy duo Key and Peele might say, “Don’t even get me started on these motherfuckers right here.”
If, as many in Congress contend, the Guantanamo detainees are enemy combatants, then they should fall under the control of the President as Commander-in-Chief. If he determines that they should be released, or transferred to civilian control for a trial for their crimes, Congress has no Constitutional authority over that decision.
On the other hand, if, as civil libertarians assert, the detainees have been wrongfully detained and should be afforded Constitutional rights, then Congress cannot simply pass a law singling them out for punishment without judicial action. Under either theory, Congress is out of luck.
Guantanamo is, of course, a disastrous blot on American history for all sorts of other reasons. It hands jihadists a PR cudgel—just look at how ISIS dresses the westerners it executes. And, as Eric Lewis, an attorney for a Guantanamo inmate, pointed out in a brilliant New York Times op-ed, the lack of Constitutional protection given to Guantanamo detainees stands in stark contrast to the protections the Roberts Court has afforded to corporations. Echoing concerns about the Hobby Lobby decision voiced in this column, Mr. Lewis rightly asks whether we can really countenance a judiciary that so clearly favors certain religious rights over others.
So President Obama should feel on strong legal and moral footing in ignoring Congress on Guantanamo. In addition, he should feel on strong historical footing, with none other than Abraham Lincoln as a good model for getting away with ignoring another branch of government.
Lincoln’s situation was actually the reverse of Obama’s. Unlike in the “war on terror” – where the definitions of terms like “imminent threat” are in flux – Lincoln was fighting a very real armed conflict against an enemy that might very well have ended the national existence of the United States. So, under precisely the circumstances delineated in the Constitution, Lincoln chose to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and begin indefinitely detaining Confederate saboteurs and sympathizers.
This action raised a key question: Could the President suspend habeas corpus, or did he need Congressional approval? In the case “Ex Parte Merryman,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney—whose jurisprudential thought produced Dred Scott—wrote that only Congress held that power. Lincoln issued his response in a special message to Congress on July 4, 1861, likely the most fraught Independence Day in American history: The “Constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power [of suspending habeas corpus]; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it can not be believed the framers … intended that in every case the danger should run its course until Congress could be called together.”
If Lincoln had had an anger translator, he might have said, “Go to hell, Taney. I’m fighting a war here.”
Admittedly, President Obama faces a different scenario. Instead of a genuine national crisis in which a suspension of civil liberties is appropriate, he faces a fearful and fear-mongering Congress that refuses to let American ideals triumph against thuggish criminals. But like Lincoln, Obama should ignore the bluster of another branch.
He has already ignored Congress when the Constitution required its approval to launch an ad hoc bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria. He might as well do it again to end an injustice that is our own making. As Luther might say, “Screw Congress. I’m shutting it down.”

Dead men tell no tales. That is, unless they decide to document their tales in a very antiquated, distinguished-looking leather bound diary, an archetype of what one would expect to find deep in the vault of the Pusey Archives. Ebenezer Turell, Class of 1721, was perceptive enough to do just that. The student of divinity founded the Telltale, America’s oldest known student publication, which ran from Sep. 9, 1721 through Nov. 1, 1721 on a roughly weekly basis and circulated throughout the Harvard student body in manuscript form.
The list of subscribers reads like a glossary at the end of a U.S. History textbook:  notable ministers such as John Davenport, Samuel Marshall, John Taylor, and Nathaniel Rogers, just to name a few, were at the forefront of colonial America’s Protestant congregation. Turell himself went on to become a fairly well-known minister in Medford, Mass.
One could assume that such intellectuals probably pontificated upon the greatest issues of their time—taxation without representation, colonial rule, revolutionary stirrings in Boston, etc. The Telltale should capture a glimpse of scholarly life during a pivotal point in American history.
This, however, is far from the case. The oldest college periodical is essentially a gossip rag.
Turell’s diary, the sole surviving record of this publication, contains 13 numbered manuscript issues handwritten in a faded calligraphy that betrays their age. Encased in crimson leather packaging added by a previous owner for protection in the early 1900s, the book nearly disintegrates at the slightest touch and must be viewed upon a Styrofoam cradle. Today’s reader must use weighted strings to hold down the pages, as the paper practically dissolves if handled with too much force. Inkblots and other mysterious blemishes conceal much of Turell’s writings, and the edges of each leaf are jagged and crude. What’s left of the Telltale resembles a fifth grade history project soaked in coffee stains and artificial tea “burns.”  However, these crumples are natural; each tarnish tells a story that is probably somehow relevant to Harvard’s lengthy history.
Turell prefaces his first article with his intentions: “This paper was entitl’d the Telltale or Criticisms on the Conversation & Behavour of Scholars to promote right reasoning & good manner.”  Apparently, he originally planned to distribute a “lifestyle” newspaper, a cross between the teachings of a Hindu guru and the etiquette of Emily Post. However, his cause grows murkier with each issue.
Turell’s articles gradually devolve into more and more inane territory and begin to read like a diary rather than news for popular consumption. His fourth article is devoted entirely to the analyses of his own dreams. He discusses a woman known as Mrs. Kate and debates whether or not to consider her “more beautiful than Venus,” or to view her as perhaps “an antidote against Matrimony.” Other dreams delve into the disturbing, detailing “four Fellows pushing and shoving one another,” and a “person of very Dark & swarthy complexion in a Slovenly Dress with 7 patches & 5 sparks on his Face.” No explanations are offered for these particular nightmares.
In the Telltale’s 12th issue, Turell attempts an exposé of the “Spy Club.” He explicitly lists its suspected members and reveals their code names: Telltale, Volubility, Blablonge, Sharpsights, Intelligence, Quick, and Courage. As he warns the reader, much mystery shrouded the Spy Club. Despite its enigmatic air, Turell’s writings are the only historical record of the existence of such an organization.
At its heart, the Telltale may not revolutionize our view of early colonial times, as it lacks the hard-hitting journalism betraying the seedy underbelly of Puritan culture we so wish it revealed. However, it does prove that—even before the age of Tumblr and Facebook—we all really just like to write about ourselves.

Much like particle physics, the Bermuda Triangle and the Canadian senate, the inner workings of Harvard’s Club Sports Committee are shrouded in mystery. In fact, surprisingly little is known about the governing body that controls the fates (and funding) of all 65 club sports at the College. How does the Committee work? How is club sport status granted? What’s involved in the application process? Club Sports Director and Coordinator Casey Blodget declined to answer our burning questions. Instead, we got the scoop from recent petitioner Hirohisa Yamada ’16.
Though I’ve never met him, I recognize Yamada from across the quiet, sunny dining hall. He has a dancer’s casual grace, and his hoodie looks like it could transition from lunch attire to dance gear on a moment’s notice. Yamada is the president of Harvard Breakers, a student breakdancing group that meets four times a week to condition, practice, and choreograph.
“Breakdancing is a form of dance which is very physically demanding,” he tells me. “You move your body in a very acrobatic way.” I recall his Facebook profile picture, which shows him upside down and supporting his entire body with one hand. I believe him.
It turns out that these acrobatics aren’t purely recreational: Breakers members compete (“battle”) regularly throughout Boston and nearby cities. I pause for a second, flashing back to every Step Up movie ever made, but Yamada assures me that these tournaments are highly structured. “Most of the time, it’s a one on one battle,” he says.
Despite its competitive nature, Breakers is not currently a club sport. Instead, as a student organization, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of Student Life. The OSL provides some practice locations, but prohibits the use of Athletic Department facilities or equipment. Student organizations also have limited funding, Yamada explains, making it difficult to hire instructors.
For those reasons, Yamada and the Breakers decided in the spring to apply for club sport status. They began by submitting a budget and membership roster, then met with a Club Sports representative in late August. This representative, the Club Sports Director and Coordinator, acts as an intermediary between applicants and the Club Sports Committee and is the first to review applications using seven exacting criteria. For example, Criterion 1: Most members of a Harvard club sport must actually be affiliated with Harvard College. Groups that fulfill this grueling requirement must then tackle criterion 2: All club presidents and leaders must also attend the College. If a group somehow manages to meet all 7 criteria, its application advances to the Committee for a final decision.
Many an oddball activity has made it through this process, including sports such as Quidditch, Spikeball, and Cornhole. In fact, the list of club sports already includes two dance groups: the Crimson Dance Team, which “falls under athletics because they work at varsity games,” and the Ballroom Dance Club, which “has been around so long they were grandfathered in as a club sport,” Yamada says. Yamada’s efforts to remain diplomatic are nearly successful as he reads me these definitions directly from an Athletic Department email.
That diplomacy wavers a bit, however, when he tells me that Harvard Breakers was ultimately turned down by the Club Sports Committee. “I think it was the fact that we are a dance group,” he says, looking skeptical. “If they did accept us, then the other dance groups on campus would also want to become club sports. They didn’t want that situation.” I squint as I try to come up with a definition for “Crimson Dance Team” that doesn’t include the phrase “dance group.”
I ask about next steps, and Yamada rattles off a few potential sources of funding, sounding troubled as he suggests the possibility of membership dues. At first, he doesn’t seem inclined to reapply for club status. “There hasn’t been much of a change in circumstances,” he explains.
I pack up my things and re-enter the windy mid-October courtyard, struggling with a vague sense of dissatisfaction. I can’t quite put my finger on its source. When I get back to my dorm, I send off an email to the Associate Director of Athletics Gary Brown. He doesn’t respond.

Long before there were grab and go lunches and weekly pub trivia nights, slot machines and pianos filled the basement of Memorial Hall. The lucky gamblers and musicians were not students or faculty, but pigeons.
Established in 1948, the Harvard Pigeon Lab was one of the many Psychological Laboratories occupying the space below Sanders Theater. It was led by a newly tenured professor who had spent the last few years trying to create a pigeon-guided missile program for the US military to use during World War II. Burrhus Frederic Skinner, known to the academic world as B.F. Skinner, would continue to experiment on pigeons, but his years at Harvard proved to be as dynamic and eclectic as his contributions to the fields of psychology and education.
Skinner’s connection to Harvard began in 1928 when he enrolled in the graduate program in psychology within what was then the Department of Philosophy and Psychology. He split most of his time between Emerson Hall, where the department was located, and his house three blocks from the Yard on Harvard Street.
The path that brought Skinner to psychology was an unusual one. Jerome Kagan, Professor Emeritus of Psychology, recalled a lunch date with Skinner, in which the eminent psychologist noted, “when he was an undergraduate, he decided to be a writer because his main goal was to change the world. He had very high ambitions. He wanted to have an effect on the world and decided that writing was the best way to do it.”
Everything changed for Skinner in his second half of college when, according to Kagan, “he read [John] Watson, who is the original behaviorist, and that persuaded him that if you want to change the world, becoming a psychologist was probably more effective.”
Graduate school at Harvard for Skinner was an experience almost completely confined to academics. He would later write in his autobiography, “The Shaping of a Behaviorist,” that “Harvard University takes little or no interest in the private lives of its graduate students,” explaining that all matters of social and residential life were not of concern to the University. He would also reflect on the fact that graduate school pushed him harder than anything before, consuming nearly all of his daytime hours.
“At Harvard I entered upon the first strict regimen of my life,” he wrote. “I would rise at six, study until breakfast, go to classes, laboratories, and libraries with no more than fifteen minutes unscheduled during the day, study until exactly nine o’clock at night, and go to bed. I saw no movies or plays, seldom went to concerts. I had scarcely any dates, and read only psychology and physiology.”
Skinner soon became interested in behaviorism, a school of psychology more concerned with behaviors themselves than the unseen mental processes behind them. Kagan explained that behaviorism is rooted in the belief that in order to teach some behavior to an organism, “all we have to do is control the rewards, the desirable things that the animal or human wants, and punish the behaviors that we don’t want. There’s no mind, there are no thoughts, everything is behavior.” Steven Pinker, Professor of Psychology, described behaviorism as “not a theory of psychology,” but instead, “really a meta-theory or a philosophy of psychology.”
While still a graduate student, Skinner invented the operant conditioning chamber, in which animals are taught certain behaviors by rewarding or punishing the animal’s actions. Later known as the Skinner Box, the apparatus was instrumental in pursuing the study of operant conditioning, an alternative to the more widely studied classical conditioning à la Pavlov’s dog.
Operant conditioning opened the door to a world of new theories and possibilities regarding control and learning. “What Skinner did was say, ‘Well, if we really want to control behavior, we’ve got to control habits that are not innately biological,’” notes Kagan. “If you want to control what people do–control their aggression, control their work habits, control their study habits–that’s all operant conditioning.”
Skinner’s years as a graduate student were spent surrounded by the giants of a field emerging as its own distinct science. He studied under professors like Henry Murray—the developer of a personality psychology called personology—and took classes alongside students like Fred Keller, who would become a renowned champion of scientific education reform. But despite contact with pioneering members of the field, Skinner largely took his own approach.
After passing his preliminary exams, Skinner all but ignored by-the-book psychology. He noted in his autobiography that upon reading through a copy of the American Journal of Psychology, he concluded “there must be a better way to find out what was going on in the field.”
“I never learned how to read the ‘literature’ in psychology, and the literature remained largely unread by me,” he went on to write. Even in his research ventures, he recalled working “entirely without supervision” and that “some kind of flimsy report” would usually suffice.
Nevertheless, Skinner would later reflect that in his late graduate years, “that [he] was doing exactly as [he] pleased.” He received his Ph.D. in 1931 and remained at Harvard to do research until 1936. After over a decade of teaching at colleges in the Midwest, he came back to Cambridge in 1948 when Harvard offered him a tenured professorship. He became the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology in 1958, a position he maintained until his retirement in 1974.
In his faculty position at Harvard, Skinner was able to continue his research into animal behavior as well as expand to other fields, both in and out of psychology. The Pigeon Lab, set up in Skinner’s first year as a professor, used birds to study behavioral principles that could be applied to humans. A Crimson article from 1949 observed Skinner in his element. “Skinner places his pigeons in a small closed box with a button in one wall,” the article reports. “The birds must peck at this button at least once every five minutes to be paid off with food. The eager but ignorant pigeon, however, not knowing he will get the same reward with less exertion, will hammer away rapidly for great lengths of time to get his dinner.” Skinner saw the experiment as providing valuable insight to the work habits and monetary incentives of human beings.
Working out of his office at the south end of Memorial Hall’s basement, Skinner put forth theories on topics ranging from the superstitious tendencies of rodents to the synthesis of internal emotions and external behaviors—a field of his own that became known as radical behaviorism.
Memorial Hall was a beloved site for experimentation. Skinner and his colleagues had significant freedom in modifying the space because administrators had little concern for the building’s underground level. When William James Hall was built as a new home for the Department of Psychology, Pinker said that Skinner and others “had to be dragged kicking and screaming out of the basement of Memorial Hall.” Scientists, Pinker notes, “love space that you can modify yourself indefinitely.”
Nonetheless, the Department managed to adapt to the move. “The 7th Floor of William James Hall was [Skinner’s] empire,” said Pinker. “When the elevator doors opened there were two bumper stickers that you could see. One of them said ‘Think Behavior,’ and the other one said ‘God is a VI,’ which is a very nerdy in-joke, VI being a variable interval schedule of reinforcement.”
By the time Skinner retired, behaviorism began to see a decline in popularity. A shift towards cognitive elements of psychology was already underway. Kagan describes the move towards study of the brain as occurring because of both technical advances that made it easier to do cognitive imaging and the desire of psychologists to examine people’s inner emotions.
“Humans think. Humans feel. Humans feel guilty if they have a bigoted thought. Operant conditioning can’t explain that,” he says.
Skinner also explored non-psychological fields, contributing to linguistics and philosophy through books like “Verbal Behavior” and “Beyond Freedom and Dignity”. One of the fields outside of psychology that was influenced by Skinner’s work is educational theory. He predicted that technology would play an increasingly greater role in the classroom, theorizing that “audio-visual aids” would come to supplement, and maybe even replace, lectures and textbooks. He developed pedagogical methods based on his conditioning theories.
Skinner’s legacy at Harvard and more broadly in his discipline remains ambiguous. Many of his theories have suffered extensive criticism and even been eclipsed by modern methods. His thoughts on education and philosophy were unique but often controversial. In any case, he was arguably one of the most famous psychologists of his time, with an unmatched drive to leave a mark in some way.
“There are two kinds of scientists,” says Kagan. “I call one kind hunters. Hunters win prizes. Hunters want a victory, they want to establish a fact that’s reliable, unambiguous, replicable…They don’t particularly care what the problem is.” He goes on, “then there are the birdwatchers. I’m a birdwatcher. Birdwatchers fall in love with a particular domain.”
This dichotomy represents, according to Kagan, “the difference between a passion about a domain and a passion to make an important discovery about anything.”
“Skinner,” he concludes, “was a hunter.”

I arrive early, which, judging from the crowd outside, is the thing to do. Peering in through the windows of Workbar, an space that feels like a hybrid office/cafe sitting just outside Central Square, I see entrepreneurs excitedly flitting around their booths and an army of folding chairs being deployed. Other than a sparse rumor or two about a hedgehog and a variety of companies, I know very little about Mass Innovation Night 67. Needless to say, I came for the hedgehog.
Immediately upon entering, I am handed a “Tweet Sheet” covered in QR barcodes and and ushered into an absolutely packed room where 10 local companies are showcasing their products.
I lower my shoulder and charge my way through the crowd to the first company, ReFleece, which is an “upcycling” organization. (Upcycling is a term I learned from the wall, upon which a live feed of Tweets with the hashtag “MIN67” is being displayed.) They take some of the 13 million tons of material wasted by clothes companies and turn them into thrifty bags, cases, and other accessories.
Companies are chosen for the Nights through a non selective process. If you’re on their list, they’ll give you a Night. They attempt to showcase two student startups a month, from different schools. The waiting list is currently five and a half months long.
In addition to Refleece, there’s On The Dot Books, a book sharing program for airports, Booze Époque, a craft cocktail catering company that describes themselves as “spirit alchemists,” and, up a staircase, the company I came for: Meet Eugene.
Meet Eugene is a student start-up that battles the problematic feeding of many hedgehog pets, a fact I learned while cradling their pet mascot, Eugene the hedgehog. Improper diets can lead to problems with obesity and cancer, shortening their average life span by three or four years. Perhaps it is the hedgehog, but I somehow coaxed into signing up for their email list.
I am also somehow coaxed into sampling a brand of organic dog food (dry, but tasty) as I make my way through the remainder of the companies. After a fifty-minute presentation, the least innovative part of the night, I am able to talk to Bobbie Carlton, the founder of the company.
The Innovation Nights were born five and a half years ago, when Carlton, out of a job after years of working marketing and global PR for software companies, found herself with too much free time on her hands.“
I don’t take well to boredom,” she tells me, in the midst of what seemed like half of the night’s attendee’s wanting to shake her hand (she is a big name in the Massachusetts Innovation Night Community).
For the first Innovation Night, Carlton sent out a blast on the then-young Twitter and wrangled ten companies and two hundred attendees. “This was never intended to be a monthly event,” she explains. “Everybody, as they were leaving that night was like ‘okay, we’ll be back next month, right?’ And I’m like, shoot.”
Now, the Nights provide a huge boost in visibility for the product launches they present. “Usually for those 30 days that we’re promoting them, we’re their biggest traffic driver,” notes Carlton. But it’s not all about the products; it’s also about the networking, and people are hungry to do it. I quickly lose count of the number of times I have to clarify that no, I do not have a company, and that no, we are not hiring.
The presentations wrap up, and the crowd disperses back to making friends and admiring products. The women from Orora Global, showcasing their affordable solar panel kit that they distribute among poor villages in India, come away having won a slew of American Airlines Business Points.
Schmoozed out for the night, I grab a complimentary sandwich for the road and slip out the door. I need something to get the taste of dog food out of my mouth.

It is scenic autumn in Harvard Square, and today my friends and I decide to take a booze trip to Cambridge Wine and Spirits. The aim is two-fold: 1) My roommate has just turned 21, and still feels that legally acquiring her own alcohol makes her a self-actualized woman, and 2) We are throwing a party. We have 40 people to intoxicate; my bank balance and the level of fucks I give are both so low, the wines I choose are named after serving suggestions.
Franzia “Chillable Red”($15.99/box—that’s $3.198/bottle) The liqueur aisle at Cambridge Wine and Spirits is stocked with lethal, sexy, fruity, jewel-toned serums baring their rich purple innards, messy as a crush of blackberries passed between young lovers’ tongues. The shining evil bottles pout on the shelves like glossy cats, silky and dangerous and just waiting for me to stroke them with my super-glam nails. (This week, said nails glitter with pink and gold confetti; “They look,” says my friend and editor, “Like you fingerfucked Aphrodite.”) I, however, do not choose any of these sirens, because they are not Franzia, and when I, like God, saw Franzia, I said, “Yea, it is affordable and of bad quality; therefore it is good.” And here it is: a bag in a box is hardly enough to contain this red’s bouquet of vinegar and plum juice. When I finally arrive home and sample this beauty, its notes of synthetic vanilla and red Capri Sun saunter across my tongue. We do not chill the Chillable Red; neither our mini fridge nor our hopes are big enough. Franzia “Refreshing White”($14.99/box—that’s $2.998/bottle) Count on queers to turn a roomful of confused drunk people into a party. It is 11:45 p.m., and my friends have descended in a pack of non-normative feelings. Also, Nicki Minaj. I distribute Refreshing White to everybody, because we are in need of refreshment. The first sip blisters my tongue. The wine is crisp as an apple slice after a day in a ziplock bag, with similar gestures towards nutmeg. It has low notes of whiskey. At this point, my good friend and several people I have never seen before decide it is an excellent idea to play “slap the bag” with the packet of Refreshing White. It is not an excellent idea; it is like trying to play beach volleyball with a Stadium Pal at the end of a long, bathroomless day. Purple Moon Chardonnay($3.99/bottle. Trader Joe’s; reviewed weeks ago and abandoned half-full in my common room, put out at the party in the hopes it would be consumed; it wasn’t.) I awake with a moderately serious hangover and visions of the sexual encounter I walked in on the night before dancing like horny sugarplums through my head. Because I am incredibly proactive and energetic, I commit to cleaning the common room. I successfully recycle the alarmingly empty vodka and gin bottles, but Purple Moon—like me at a seventh grade dance—is sitting weeping with a bad haircut on the sidelines, untasted and unloved. I no longer want to deal with its feelings, so I chug the last two gulps and discard. The pleasant sweetness of the wine’s youth has turned bitter, much like I will be as a single woman in my mid-thirties as I sit drinking mom wines while jealously hate-liking my friends’ wedding photos. Its previously firm bubbles have sagged to the floor like my future breasts. To ward off the inevitable, I dress for brunch in wedges.  The Crimson’s Resident Lesbian Sex Icon Reina A.E. Gattuso ’15 is a Literature and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrator in Adams House.

I meet Scott Poulson-Bryant in Kirkland dining hall as he’s finishing up lunch with a couple of students. He lingers for a few seconds, offering his final words to the conversation before directing his attention to me. We walk into Kirkland Junior Common Room, which is completely empty apart from one student. Poulson-Bryant politely asks if we can share the room. The two seem to already know each other.
Poulson-Bryant is a resident tutor, writing tutor, BGLTQ tutor, and Race Relations tutor in Kirkland House. Along with the numerous positions he holds in the house, he’s also a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s American Studies program.
“I remember seeing graduate students spending all their time alone in an apartment with books, and that’s their entire life,” Poulson-Bryant says. “I knew I didn’t want that life as a grad student—I like being part of a community and being around young people. You know, laughing and hearing about people’s lives.”
It’s not hard to see just how much he values community—he’s already recognized and greeted every student who’s passed through the room we’re sitting in.
Poulson-Bryant sits across from me on a couch, wearing a baseball cap and a Brown University t-shirt. He ended up completing his undergraduate education at Brown 15 years after he started it.
“I did my first three years at Brown and then took a year off after my junior year,” Poulson-Bryant explains. “I went to New York and interned at “The Village Voice” newspaper—that sort of convinced me that I was making the right decision. Writing was what I wanted to do.”
After that first year, Poulson-Bryant was offered an entry-level position as a fact-checker at ‘The Village Voice,’ which prompted him to take another year off from Brown. “That year off turned into 15 years off,” Poulson-Bryant laughs. “After ‘Village Voice,’ I started writing for ‘Rolling Stone,’ then the editors at ‘Spin Magazine’ saw my work. I became a 21-year-old college dropout writing for Spin.”
Shortly after, Poulson-Bryant met Quincy Jones, who helped him co-found ‘Vibe Magazine.’ Poulson-Bryant was at ‘Vibe’ for about eight-and-a-half years. He then worked at the ‘New York Times,’ and then eventually moved onto his childhood dream of writing books.
Poulson-Bryant’s light demeanor and friendly, relaxed tone give little hint of the serious work he’s done throughout his life. Although he’s in his forties, he could be easily mistaken for a student in Kirkland House, especially as he cheerily calls out, “Hey, girl” to yet another student he seems to know well.
“I came here to start my education in the fall of 2009,” Poulson-Bryant states. His dissertation in the American Studies program is on the performance of race in 1970s American popular culture.
“Everyone else is in the 18th century, you know, doing war and politics, and I’m doing the ’70s,” Poulson-Bryant chuckles, but quickly turns serious as he gushes about his intellectual pursuits. “I’m writing about the ways in which the aesthetic labor of African Americans within the 1970s was influenced by the political rhetoric coming out of the 1960s, so, you know, Black Power, the Civil Rights Movement, stuff like that.”
Poulson-Bryant’s genuine fascination with his dissertation topic, as well as being a student in general, shines through as he continues to explicate his research interests to me. I ask him about how he ended up as a tutor in Kirkland in the midst of working on his graduate degree.
“When I talked to other graduate students in the American Studies program here about how I was a 30-year-old making friends with all these 19-year-olds at Brown, because those were the people who were there when I went back, a lot of them said, ‘Well, you seem to get along well with young people and should think about being a tutor.’” Poulson-Bryant eventually got an offer from both Kirkland and Winthrop House to be a tutor. He says he chose Kirkland for its smaller community size.
Thanks to Poulson-Bryant, Kirkland now hosts a movie night every Friday, a showcase of queer cinema. The first meeting was last week. He showed ‘Boys in the Band,’ a 1970s film about the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. “It was great,” he tells me. “I told myself if you get five kids that’s great—I actually got 11!”
It is through seemingly casual events like movie nights that Poulson-Bryant connects his work to student life. “Social movements are really important to me, so identity in my work as a journalist and my work as a scholar is important,” he says. “[For my students] this is a time in life—late adolescence, post-twenties—when they’re dealing with issues of identity. Any aid I can be to help kids figure out how to negotiate identity politics or, you know, ways of being in the world, I feel like I should be there to do that.”
Poulson-Bryant’s interests have also connected him to people who are the polar opposite of academia. He interviewed Beyoncé in 2006 while writing for ‘GIANT Magazine.’ Of the encounter, he comments, “It was a great experience because she was on the cusp of going from post-Destiny’s Child to global ‘Beygency’ superstar. I sort of pride myself on being at the right place at the right time. I get to look at artists before they explode or just after they explode. Those are good moments to interview someone because their lives are these weird, transient things.”
He had a similar experience with P. Diddy. “I wrote the first long profile of Puff Daddy and back then he was just an A&R guy at Uptown Records,” he remembers. “From having run into him a couple times on the hip-hop scene, I could see that there was more to this kid. I sensed he wanted to be as big of a star as Jodeci and Mary J. Blige and Biggie, you know, the artists he was doing A&R stuff for. [After the piece came out] I’d run into him at a party and he’d say, ‘You know what brotha? You made me!’”
Wth his gamma of experience, Poulson-Bryant believes that his next step naturally falls into becoming a professor. “Teaching has been one of the best experiences of my being a graduate student, and it’s convinced me that this decision to leave journalism full-time and become a professor is the right one.”
At the end of our conversation, as Poulson-Bryant reflects back on his time as a tutor at Harvard, he admits that thinking about having gone through his graduate studies without the experience of being a tutor would have certainly been less fulfilling. “I really appreciate that I can connect with the students in the classroom and hopefully teach them something and, you know, advise and mentor them here in the house, but also socialize with them or hear about their lives outside of the academic or residential lives.”
“Students often tell me I’m not the ‘average’ TF or tutor,” Poulson-Bryant adds, implying he’d like me to decipher the message for him. I assure him that in his case, it’s definitely a good thing.

Honeycombs, 3D puzzles, and ghost chili pepper: A student (or curious tourist) can find all of these niche products on Mass. Ave. Just a few steps away from each other, three stores succeed in maintaining local business models and adding pleasant surprises to any casual Harvard Square stroll. FM takes a look at some of these quirky stores around the Square.
The Games People Play1100 Mass. Ave.
Carol Monica was wandering through a game convention in Germany when she spotted Die Siedler von Catan, a board game she had never seen before. She brought it back to her games and puzzles store in Harvard Square, The Games People Play. It was the first shop to sell Settlers of Catan in the entire country.
“Back then, it wasn’t even in English,” Monica says. “It was all these silly translations from German.”
Monica started The Games People Play in 1974 because she couldn’t find a place to buy Scrabble in the Square.
“We were in a recession then, and people would stay home and play board games,” Monica recalls. “I just thought it would be a good thing to open, especially here, right between Harvard and MIT.”
Now, after moving to 1100 Mass. Ave. from a tiny little shop across the street, the store offers everything from jigsaw puzzles to strategy games, backgammon to fantasy games, crossword books to yo-yos, kites to playing cards. Monica travels to several conventions a year, including the Nuremberg Toy Fair in Germany on occasion, to discover new products.
“We are a games boutique, serving a niche market,” Monica said. “We’re pretty well-known and have even become a destination store for out-of-towners.”
Monica described the average customer age range as 18-40, except for customers of war games, who are “never under 40.” Over the years, Monica has seen the customer demographic shift from primarily male to balanced in gender.
“More and more young women and girls are playing games and puzzles,” Monica observes.
Salt & Olive1160 Mass. Ave.
Harissa spice olive oil and blackberry ginger vinegar have become easier than ever to acquire in the Square. Six weeks ago, Mary D. Taylor opened the niche store Salt & Olive, which specializes in gourmet olive oils, aged balsamic vinegars, spices, and teas.
“We want people to come here and be inspired and share what they create with their friends and family,” Taylor says. “We want to be a community resource, a location for people to gather and talk about food.”
Salt & Olive is sustainably built, with LEEDs-certified flooring, repurposed products and regionally-sourced building materials. The store offers 24 olive oils and 25 aged balsamic vinegars on tap. Flavors of olive oil include blood orange, wild mushroom and sage, and bergamot citrus, while types of vinegar include dark chocolate, pomegranate and lavender. The store also sells 50 varieties of tea, 20 varieties of salts, and 150 varieties of spices, including ghost chili pepper.
“We’ve had quite a few sneezes from that,” Taylor acknowledges, laughing.
Taylor is a bona fide expert when it comes to olive oil. She is a certified olive oil taster and recommends customers seek out a “pungent, peppery taste.” She also views olive oil as a quickly growing industry in the United States.
“The American palette is maturing. Olive oil now is where wine was about 20 or 30 years ago,” Taylor says. “The global olive oil market is about $12 billion. The American olive oil market is about $1 billion. For the past decade, it’s had triple-digit growth.”
Follow the Honey1132 Mass. Ave.
A decade ago, Mary W. Canning traveled to India to learn beekeeping as an apprentice under Kamala Devi, the founder of a village beekeeping society. Now, she is the owner of Follow the Honey, which offers locally and globally-sourced honeys and bee-inspired products, including honey chocolates, beeswax candles, honey-infused lotions, honey antiseptics, bee-design jewelry, and honeypots.
“I saw people going from mud huts to stucco homes and sending their daughters to school just because they were practicing good, sustainable beekeeping,” Canning says. “I was inspired to do something similar here. Follow the Honey unifies honey producers who can’t make it independently but in a farmer’s collective have the power to access the marketplace.”
Canning describes honey as the perfect intersection for conversations on poverty, class, globalization, and environmental destruction. Follow the Honey is working with Mount Grace Conservation Trust to raise awareness about a fracking pipeline soon to be placed near the Harvard Forest area.
“People in Boston won’t know about it until it’s already got clearance,” Canning said. “We’ve got to put pressure on our representatives.”
The store has a global outreach, as Canning sells honey from as far away as Bostwana and as close to home as Deerfield, Mass. In three weeks, Canning will travel to Tanzania and work with its ministry to bring Tanzanian honey to the store. Follow the Honey is also planning to expand into food trucks and pop-up events, with the next pop-up in Austin, Texas.
“People come in and say ‘oh, you have honey straws,’ and are so delighted by everything,” Canning says. “They can indulge their inner child. They go from being stressed to relaxed, and we love seeing that.”

One thing I have gotten better at over the past few years is letting go: of calculus, of dance classes in which you get called out for wearing anything other than your leotard and tights, of the size zero jeans that I outgrew in 8th grade and somehow managed to fit into again in 11th grade, of drinking coffee exclusively on Fridays. In a word: discipline.
I’ve yet to decide whether this change is rooted in an increase or a decrease in my self-love, or in the love from the people around me. But I’ve begun to worry that I’ve gotten so good at letting go that I’ve forgotten how to hold on.
***
A dancer spends much of her time looking in the mirror, eyes locked with their own image, locked on her fingertips, her hip muscles, hip bones, or hip flesh. In moments of luxury, she gets to look out into an audience, but, blinded by lights, the only thing she knows for certain is that the crowd can see every move she makes. She hopes to hold their gaze with confidence, hold her leg with strength, hold her balance with poise.
Over the course of the spring semester last year, my dancer’s grasp loosened. My response to are you a dancer became I dance. Next, my response to do you dance became I used to. I would worry my collar bones were disappearing, but knew I must resist hiding the place where they used to protrude.
There is little as defeating as struggling with something you used to thrive at. Hearing praise sung after a performance came to hurt when coupled with dissatisfaction in my own work. I found myself disappointed in people for finding this compromised version of me captivating. I was embarrassed that they felt compelled to congratulate me. The physical twinge in my back as I accepted a compliment told me that I was demanding my body fake something it was no longer qualified to do.
This summer, in the shower in Botswana, I decided that time was running out for me to confront my flimsy grip on dance. Whether I felt it was qualified or not, people who knew my body wanted me to use it, to contribute it to things they were making. If my body were going to be an instrument in the jam sessions of my loved ones, I needed to tune it. Otherwise, I didn’t want to be playing.
***
The physical release, the letting go within a posture is the hardest part for some dancers, but it always came naturally to me. It was the holding, the supporting, the controlling that took effort. But it was also the holding, the supporting, the controlling, that enabled me to let go, that rendered me someone who held focus on a stage. How might I work again to hone the hold, support, control? It would probably require a leotard and tights, but perhaps I could find a space with room for huge tunics on top as well.
Two months out of Botswana and the shower, I sat in a circle at the end of auditions for the Harvard Dance Project, a for-credit faculty-led student company headed by Jill Johnson—the director of Harvard’s dance program. She invited us to introduce ourselves and say why we were interested in the class.
One student explained that she had danced every semester she’d been at Harvard, until the one before last, when she choreographed a piece instead. That semester she found herself so unhappy with the absence of movement that she took the following one off. When she explained her eagerness to dance again and apologized for how out of dance-shape she was, Jill nodded sympathetically, placed her hand on this dancer’s knee, and said, it’s a little bit like grieving. To return to dance, she meant, takes care and patience and time, to remember and recall and retrieve, to forget and forgive.
It’s a little bit like grieving.
What exactly is it that we grieve, as dancers returned to the marley, to the mirror, to the music? An ability we had come to demand of ourselves, expect of ourselves, respect of ourselves. A body that passed the standards we tried to keep afloat. Those standards themselves. A marriage to the mirror. Perhaps a marriage loving and supportive enough to sustain and inspire occasional independence. Perhaps a marriage less stable, more clingy. Constant feedback. Must I make room for these absences?Allow room? Excuse the room that has made itself?
It’s a little bit like grieving, but it’s not completely like grieving.
Because it isn’t simply a process of mourning something that was and is no longer. It isn’t a process of reconstructing a new life that respects the gap left behind, one that works to heal around the hole. It’s a process of navigating how large to allow the gap to grow. Navigating how much control you have over quarantining the loss. Navigating how pervasively present something in yourself used to be. And how pervasive that might render the absence. Moving forward is a whirlwind of memories that embrace you without warning. It is thinking carefully and patiently and forgivingly about what of the old to hug tighter, how to pull it closer, and how to lovingly let the rest walk away.
For now, I think I’ll hug listening tight. Listening to the joy and breath the Dance Center infuses in me. To the frustration. To the feedback my fingertips give, and to the way the toes, heels, and balls of my feet take turns communicating with the marley. To the bodies of fellow dancers as I watch them from across the room, drawing someone’s hip with my shoulder as she draws my shoulder with her hip. To these bodies as I come closer to them, playing in the negative space their shapes create.
I’ll hug tight listening to my process of care and patience and time, of remember and recall and retrieve and forget and forgive. And I’ll let myself go where that takes me.

According to the Crimson Cash website, Crimson Cash, a declining balance convenience account, can be used at 38 vendors, including two Bolocco locations (thank God) and IHOP. But we wanted to know, other than a smiley-face pancake off of the IHOP kid’s menu despite not being under twelve, what is the most degenerate things that you can buy with your Crimson Cash?That’s right, Mom, Dad, other Mom, Dad, we need you to up the balance on our Cash Cards, we are all out of magic swipes. We’re all out of laundry money because we used all our Crimson Cash to buy booze and cigarettes (Is this embezzlement?). Here’s what we managed to buy.
C’EST BON After sending ten-minutes picking out the perfect flavor of Lime-a-rita (the Mango one!), we were informed by the cashier at Savon that we could not buy alcohol or lottery tickets using our Crimson Cash. We could, however, buy cigarettes. Black and Milds, the first of many, we suppose.
CVS Turns out you can buy anything at CVS using Crimson Cash–anything. Cold Medicine? Check. Condoms? Check. Home enema kit? Check. Because of the “Savon Incident” we were worried that we wouldn’t be able to get pure drinking alcohol. So we bought a mouthwash with a high alcohol content (one grade above Rubinoff, and five grades cheaper). We asked about whether or not we could use Crimson Cash to buy a vibrator and a IDENTIGENE paternity test for $34.99. We could. However, the test required an additional $119 laboratory fee, and after waiting on hold for twenty minutes with the DNA clinic, we assumed that no, they would not take Crimson Cash, and that yes, when in doubt, we would just have to raise Blake Lively’s baby as our own.
CARDULLO’S Turns out you can buy booze. Just very very very classy booze. We bought the cheapest can–Old Speckled Hen: English Ale. The cashier wrapped it in a brown paper bag, which was degenerate enough for us.
HENRIETTA’S TABLE At 3 p.m. a glass of Bantam Cider (and even water, if you tell people it’s because you are pregnant) is pretty degenerate. We could also buy a shot of whiskey if we wanted to. But we didn’t. It takes a while for the bartender to process the Crimson Cash.
CVS (AGAIN)We went back to look for porn. The cashier told us to check across the street at the Harvard News Stand–unfortunately they don’t take Crimson Cash.
BROADWAY MARKETNo. No porn here. Just more classy booze.

Get Out: Cambridge Public Library Main Branch
Hours:
Monday-Thursday: 9 a.m. - 9 p.m.
Friday-Saturday: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Sunday: 1 p.m. - 5 p.m.
Location:
449 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02138
On Broadway street, just a few blocks east of the Science Center, is what the Boston Society of Architects has deemed the “single most beautiful building” in the Boston metropolitan area. You might have even wandered past it before, and wondered what the building—which looks like a glowing glass jewel box—contains.
This lovely structure is the main branch of the Cambridge Public Library. Boasting seating for over 200 people, nearly 100 public computers, seven community meeting spaces, separate children’s and teen rooms, and plenty of WiFi and natural sunlight to go around, the Cambridge Public Library is truly a city jewel. However, chances are you, like many Harvard students, have never ventured beyond the Science Center Plaza to visit. Here is FM’s push for you hike up your backpack and make the short and worthwhile trek.
The Historic Library (Stone)
The old library, built in 1888 and on the National Register for Historic Places, is what you might think of when you hear the word “library.” The exterior is reddish stone and boasts a turret; the interior is furnished with heavy wooden tables, soft lights, and ornate ceilings. You won’t find any cranky pince-nez-wearing librarians here. However, the old library is home to the multimedia lab and the teen room, as well as an excellent collection of graphic novels. Take a volume from the shelves (FM recommends the architecture-themed graphic novel Asterios Polyp by David Mazzucchelli) and settle into one of the warm wooden chairs, or embark on a scavenger hunt for the stone gargoyles perched around the building.
The Main Library (Glass)
An elegant glass corridor takes you seamlessly to the newly built main library, opened in 2009 as part of a $90 million expansion. Three stories plus a basement contains the bulk of the library’s extensive fiction, nonfiction, magazine, and film collections. The walls of the main building are nearly all glass. Even on the coldest and cloudiest of days, light floods in to bathe the many tables and study spaces. Even more exciting: food and drink are allowed in most areas of the main library. Bring your p-set or a book here, grab a coffee and croissant from Broadway Market, and forget all about days spent in the fluorescent-lit carrels of Lamont.
Events
Want to hear authors like Junot Díaz read and have a chat with him afterwards? Here’s the place to do it. Cambridge Public Library holds over 100 programs each month. The main library’s airy lecture hall is the perfect setting for author talks and even orchestral performances. Smaller rooms are perfect for writing workshops and book groups, where you can meet people from outside of the Harvard bubble. A sampling of fall events: Junot Díaz read from The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao on Tuesday, October 14; later this month, the library will host special craft sessions with local authors during National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) in October and November; and the Boston Symphony Orchestra will perform a Community Concert on Sunday, October 19 at 2:30 p.m.
Eats
The Cambridge Public Library has a fully stocked vending machine, but if you’re in the mood for more substantial fare, have a slice of pizza from the excellent Angelo’s Pizza Co. right across the street. Or head back in the direction of the square to get surprisingly tasty ribs from the hot foods bar at Broadway Market. A short jaunt north, through the campus of Cambridge Rindge and Latin school, will take you to Darwin’s Ltd. on Cambridge St., where you can get a sandwich fix.
Joan Lorentz Park
The library overlooks a vast green lawn dotted with tall oak trees and plenty of park benches. After you’ve gotten your food, take a study break to sit outside and enjoy the fall weather. The library is beautiful from the outside—the glass exterior reflects the sky and clouds above. Cantabridgians spread out picnic blankets, children play in the playground, dogs race and roll in the grass. As twilight nears, the library begins to glow from within. Old and new blend harmoniously. Spend a day here, and you just might forget how to get back to Harvard.

One Urban Dictionary entry defines “jock” as “US slang for the thick-but-amiable types that always do well socially.” A similar Wikipedia page designates the stereotypical jock as “unintelligent,” “handsome, muscular and athletic,” and “abusing alcohol or drugs.” These stereotypes aren’t shocking; they’ve become hallmark motifs in nearly every aspect of popular culture.
At Harvard, athletes make up about 20 percent of the student body. Oftentimes, they boast visual markers of their athleticism: black Harvard-crested backpacks and sleek warm-up jackets. It’s no secret that many of them are involved in final clubs, fraternities, and sororities as well.
But the ‘jock’ stereotype couldn’t be further from the truth for many athletes on campus. Some varsity athletes stay in on their Friday nights to do homework; others spend their free time watching movies or playing ping pong. Beyond athletic prowess, there is no common thread among Harvard athletes, who come in all shapes and sizes. The perception, more so than it is inaccurate, is damaging.
Harvard’s Definition Of “Jock”
At Harvard, varsity athletes are aware of the universal “jock” stereotype, and understand that its prevalence colors how other students view them.
Jack L. Kelley ’18, a varsity heavy-weight rower, acknowledges that the stereotype on campus is that athletes “study less” and “aren’t as smart.” Abbey R. Frazer ‘17, an ice hockey player, adds that athletes are known to, instead, “spend more time partying and socializing.”
But oftentimes athletes choose Harvard because of its non-stereotypical atmosphere. Alika I. Keene ’16, a varsity soccer player, chose to come to Harvard over “big soccer schools” because “people were driven, conversations were interesting, and every single stereotype that others had about Harvard was incorrect,” she says.
For Kelley, coming to Harvard was a “no brainer” because of its “unparalleled” academics in addition to its impressive rowing team.
Justin T. Fox ’17, a football player, says that athletes make a conscious choice about what kind of college atmosphere they become a part of, just like any other student. “You have to think about it, because if you were really concerned about the social aspect of things, would you have gone to Harvard or would you have gone to some state school?” he asks. “For Harvard standards, we definitely have taken on the role of the ‘Harvard jock,’ but that’s not really a ‘jock,’ anyway.”
And it is hard to pin the label “jock” onto athletes at Harvard; last year, two out of the 24 juniors elected to Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa were varsity athletes.
“Traditionally, This Is An Academic Institution”  
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the jock stereotype at Harvard is the notion that athletes don’t care about academics.
“I don’t want to say look down, because that’s too strong, but [non-athletes] don’t hold us in the highest of regards in comparison to others in the university,” Andrew E. Wheeler-Omiunu ’17, a varsity soccer player, says. “Traditionally, this is an academic institution, and it’s hard to break traditions.”
Keene says that she’s heard people “murmur” about the number of athletes in a class, as if that could dictate difficulty levels. But she emphasizes the importance of being engaged, at least, in both her academic and athletic worlds.
“I definitely know that I’m not the smartest Harvard student,” she explains. “I’m probably not even the top 90 percent. But I also don’t hate school. I do find it frustrating when trying to balance everything, but that just comes with the territory.”
Many non-athletes and athletes alike are surprised by the level of academic focus it takes to be on a team. Time management becomes especially crucial with 20 plus hours of practice and games a week.
Lydia E. Burns ’16, a member of the women’s rugby team, emphasizes that playing a varsity sport has actually forced her to be a more efficient worker.
“Some of the girls [on the team] are the smartest people I know,” Burns wrote in an email to FM. “A sport is a huge commitment; it is not for everyone, but I admire those that stick with it and still manage to prioritize school as well and succeed in both realms.”
Kelley agrees; he says that athletes “have to be better with time management.” When one of his non-athlete roommates complained about not having enough hours in the day, his other roommate, a member of the hockey team, suggested he “mix in a sport.”
For the amount of dedication it takes to be involved in both academics and athletics, Fox acknowledges that, in certain cases, athletes have to make a choice between the two. He says that some of his teammates will choose to take on an easier course load while in season.
“Because our schedule is so demanding in season, we have a full semester of Gen Eds or BS classes—at least that’s what I’m doing this semester,” he says.
And others, who choose to to take rigorous classes during season, are forced to make sacrifices. Jake T. Horton ’18, a varsity hockey player, says he spends his Fridays and Saturdays studying in order to “keep [his] head above water.”
While balancing academics and athletics is tough, adding any other time-intensive extra-curriculars is virtually unheard of. Last year, Fox was part of the Harvard LowKeys, an a capella group. He ended up being late to about 20 football practices—more than the entire team combined in the previous two years. “It got to the point where it was like ‘I’m not doing something right,’ so I had to drop [a capella] because I wanted to stay on the team,” he says.
Social Perks?  
For the majority of the week, athletes lift weights, do homework, go to practice, take mid-terms. And, like all students, they look forward to their free time, during which they can forget about their demanding lives.
Wheeler-Omiunu, as a sophomore, has witnessed firsthand the sort of perks afforded to athletes at Harvard. He says that final clubs for athletes, and the punch process in particular, “are so different.”
“If you’re an athlete on the team, you’re through the first round [of punch],” he explains. “It’s completely different. We do have that advantage for final clubs, which are for some people and not for others.”
Fox, on the other hand, doesn’t see many social perks associated with being an athlete. “It’s not like some other school where we would be more respected,” he says. “I guess the thing is that we’re taller, we’re athletic and built, and handsome, so there are the perks of that.”
Frazer says that a typical “going out” night for her teammates consists of pregaming together and going off to “different final clubs.” In some cases, she says, athletes have advantages getting into a club on a Saturday night in addition to getting through the punch process.
If one doesn’t participate, “you just miss an opportunity to get to know your team better and be more of a group,” Frazer says. But if she were to go out more, she thinks she wouldn’t get any work done.
Pieter J. Zenner ’17, a former varsity soccer athlete, started a Harvard chapter of the fraternity Kappa Sigma last year in large part because of his limited social opportunities as a freshman. Because the older guys on the soccer team gravitated towards their final clubs, he says, there were few full-team social outlets.
“Some of [the team] who weren’t in final clubs were, I’m not gonna say fed up, but were looking for an alternative,” Zenner explains. “Those are the guys who are in Kappa Sigma—sophomores and stuff like that.”
A Balancing Act
Practice and game schedules hold precedent over parties, and often dictate if, and when, athletes go out.
Fox explains the phenomenon around the “mini weekend.” In the football off-season, there’s no practice on Wednesday; so, on Tuesday night, his teammates will go out to bars or clubs.
“The guys all get turnt up, just like it’s a Friday night,” Fox says. “And of course we’ll have academics the next day, but academics are never more challenging than football practice.”
There are some social outlets particular to athletic teams, like mixers and all-team parties, many of which involve alcohol. Wheeler-Omiunu explains that, while partying isn’t his first choice activity for a Friday night, he does it because that’s what many of his teammates want to do.
“[If they want to go to a party], that’s where I’m gonna be, because I like spending time with them,” he says. “At the same time, if they just wanna chill and listen to some good music, that’s what I’m about, and I’m definitely gonna be there.”
Wheeler-Omiunu does think that the athletic social outlets are somewhat limited to drinking and partying. “There should be more open-mindedness about how people want to spend their social lives,” he says.
Frazer expresses a similar sentiment. She often feels left out when the girls on the team go out and she chooses not to. “Not to say that I don’t like to have fun, but I like to have fun in different ways,” she says. “They might think it’s boring, but to me it’s enjoyable.”
Burns says that the mixture of athletics and academics no doubt limits her time to socialize.
“I have such hard weeks both academically and with practice and training that when the weekend comes around I mostly just sleep and do homework,” Burns writes in an email.
Ultimately, every student at Harvard can relate to having to sacrifice some activities for others. “Everyone brings something else to table,” Horton says. “Sports are ‘my thing,’ but everyone dedicates their time to some activity.”
This diversity of experience can also be athletes’ favorite part of Harvard, including Keene: “Everyone is so unique and involved with different things, that it's impossible to fit people under one umbrella.”
Sections
It’s late one morning in early October, and Rakesh Khurana is moving around. The new dean of Harvard College has a few rare minutes of downtime to spend in his new office in University Hall between two of his regularly scheduled meetings, though he barely sits down. He hovers first, pages through a binder on his desk, and then sits briefly at his computer.
Perched on top of the monitor is a miniature robot, one of the first toys his parents bought him after they emigrated from India to the United States when he was a child. Behind his desk are two cans of tea and an electric kettle; Earl Grey is his caffeinated beverage of choice.
He only spends a few minutes in front of the computer before Associate Dean of the College Joan Rouse, who is more or less Khurana’s chief of staff, sticks her head into the room; she needs him to look something over. Khurana promptly walks out of his office and joins her in the hallway.
Soon enough, he’s back. But not much later, he calls out to his assistant and, with a stack of papers in hand, paces in and out of the room.
He jokes to everyone he sees today that watching him work is like “watching paint dry.” But in just a few hours, Khurana moves from place to place to meet with several of the College’s major players, from the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council in the morning to University President Drew G. Faust in the afternoon. Just a few months into the job, he’s hitting the ground running.
Rakesh Khurana, many close to him will tell you, is a visionary—an earnest, quick-walking, fast-talking visionary. The excitable dean has been clamoring at every chance he gets to sell his vision for Harvard College, which he says will help defend Harvard’s educational model.
This Business School professor, tapped to lead Harvard College through a changing educational landscape that some fear undervalues the liberal arts, is nothing if not on a mission. Khurana, a scholar of leadership and organizations, crossed the Charles River to the College to rearticulate its purpose and retool the workings of its administration. A man who both studies and eschews hierarchy, Khurana is carving a niche as the administrator uniquely positioned to set the tone guiding the decisions that others embedded in Harvard’s bureaucratic structure will ultimately make.
THE BIG PICTURE
Khurana starts most every conversation with one thing: the mission of Harvard College. He waxes poetic about providing students with an intellectually, socially, and personally “transformational” undergraduate experience through the classroom, the House system, and everything in between. In his first semester in University Hall, he’s already perfected this elevator pitch. Whether it’s a casual conversation in Annenberg or a speech at  freshman Convocation, Khurana tells anyone who cares to listen that the College’s mission is to “educate the citizens and citizen leaders for our society.”
“You will not get through a discussion with me without talking about the mission,” Khurana says one afternoon in Cabot House dining hall. He later adds, when asked if faculty members hear about it, too: “I talk about it with everybody.”
Khurana has always been a man of big ideas. Max Weber and John Dewey and their writings on bureaucracy and education, respectively, are his intellectual influences. Unprompted, he laments the ubiquity of cynicism and the lack of idealism among people today. He talks about the value of intellectual community with as much fervor as one might expect from a House master, but with additional zest.
That intellectual drive was evident during his student days at Harvard Business School. In 1993, fresh out of working at a small technology firm in Cambridge, Khurana began graduate work; he would eventually earn his Ph.D. in organizational behavior after studying at both the Business School and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Sociology Department. From the moment Khurana stepped into the classroom, the Business School professors who would later become his colleagues identified him as unique.
“He was clearly a brilliant mind, clearly excellent at conceptualizing, and very dedicated. He stood out among all the students,” says Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of business administration and one of Khurana’s mentors. “It was totally clear from the way he put together ideas that he was able to think about phenomena in a very sophisticated way.”
By the time Khurana left campus for an assistant professorship at MIT in 1998, senior professors at the Business School were determined to one day bring him back, according to another of his mentors, Jay W. Lorsch, a professor in the Business School’s Organizational Behavior unit. Two years later, he did return, at the urging of an especially close mentor and friend, Nitin Nohria—now the Business School’s dean.
As he climbed the tenure track, Khurana differentiated himself from his peers. Scott A. Snook, a senior lecturer of business administration, remembers Khurana as one of the only junior faculty members willing to speak up at Business School faculty meetings.
“He’d get up there and just push back,” says Snook, who has known Khurana since they were graduate students together. “In that room, where everybody decides if he gets tenure.”
CROSSING THE RIVER
The consensus today is that Khurana was a natural pick to lead the College; as a beloved Cabot House master, he spends more time with undergraduates than does the average member of the Business School faculty.
But on the whole, his resume tells a different story. By 2008, Khurana had earned tenure at the Business School, and soon the newly-minted Marvin Bower Professor of Leadership Development was on his way up within the school’s Organizational Behavior unit. Working with Nohria and Kanter, he co-founded a cross-Harvard development program for leaders in 2009. Soon after, he was selected to serve as the course head for a required first-year MBA curriculum on organizational behavior.
“Everybody thought he would be one of the leaders of the unit for years to come,” says Lorsch from his office, only a few doors down the hall from Khurana’s now-infrequently occupied space in Morgan Hall at the Business School.
A group of professors at FAS had other plans. After a cheating scandal roiled the College in 2012 and its dean stepped down the next year, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith tasked 21 faculty members with advising his search for the College’s next permanent leader—a dean who would step in after a period of both internal and external strife.
Late last fall, the search committee approached Khurana with a question: Would he be interested in trying for the job? Khurana, for his part, says he had no plans to apply for the position before being asked. “It was not something I had on my horizon,” he says.
Surprised, he went ahead and interviewed, but doubted that his chances were strong. “I thought it was nice to be nominated, that it would be nice to share with the search committee my thoughts about the undergraduate experience—what it was, where the opportunities were—and that was about as much as I had considered,” Khurana says now.
The Business School professor wasn’t a traditional candidate to head a liberal arts college. Although a sociologist, Khurana’s primary academic appointment is at a professional school. Several other people considered for the position, according to a source directly involved in the interview process, had day jobs that were more directly tied to the liberal arts and sciences: they included Edward J. Hall, a Philosophy professor and the chair of the Committee on General Education; Kay K. Shelemay, who holds appointments in both the Music and African and African American Studies departments; and Jonathan Holloway, then the chair of Yale’s African American Studies Department and master of Calhoun College. He was appointed Yale College’s dean in May.
Smith describes appointing Khurana to the deanship as an “easy decision on my part because there were so many people supportive of him.”
“He speaks extremely eloquently and passionately about the liberal arts education and the future and where we're going, and the man has infinite energy,” Smith says. “People all recognize that.”
In January, Smith offered Khurana the job. Lorsch recalls that Khurana asked him whether he should accept the offer.
“You spend 10 years grooming somebody to do something, and then he gets plucked out to do something else, you’ve got to have a little bit of remorse,” Lorsch says. Still, he advised Khurana to go ahead and do it. Khurana assumed the role on July 1.
ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR
Dean Khurana paces the aisle outside his ground floor office in University Hall early one afternoon in late September. He stops and pokes his head in the door of the College’s new dean for administration and finance, Sheila C. Thimba, who joined the Dean’s Office after leaving Rutgers this summer. He sees that she’s busy, says they’ll talk later, and moves on. Such interruptions are a common occurrence in Khurana’s University Hall.
“In business school, it’s probably called management by walking around,” Thimba says a few minutes later. “He’s very present.”
Khurana runs his office with the attitude of an organizational leadership scholar. An academic who studies executive labor markets and whose work berates the “curse of the superstar CEO,” he is skeptical of top-down leadership, and it shows in conversation about his own staff.  He repeatedly describes the distribution of power at the College as “flat.” He even renamed the team of senior College staff advisors, known to his predecessors as the Dean’s Cabinet, because he thought that sounded too hierarchical.
The staff in Cabot House have long been used to Khurana’s leadership methods. He and his wife Stephanie Khurana have been running the House this way since they became co-masters in 2010. According to Emily W. Stokes-Rees, Cabot’s former resident dean who left last spring for a tenure-track position at Syracuse, he and Stephanie ran the House as a team, with structure in a “functional sense”—convening meetings with the relevant staff members depending on the topic—but no real hierarchy. There is “no doubt” that Khurana’s studies influence his approach to “everything,” Stokes-Rees says by phone, though Khurana does not go into staff meetings and announce it. “I think he lives it,” she says.
When he heads down Garden St. to work every morning—he starts his day at 7 a.m., assuming he catches the shuttle from the Quad—Khurana carries his things in a distinctive black backpack, emblazoned with the Business School’s crest. He has used it for about three months now; he stopped carrying his old bag after his kids made fun of the ink stains at the bottom. 
One could call it symbolic. With the bag, Khurana carries a piece of the Business School with him everywhere he goes. His repetition of the College’s mission—even to people who hear it every day—connects back to his core belief that organizations must stay focused on their purposes. He begins every meeting with it.
Colleagues immediately point to Khurana’s articulation of the mission as something that orients their work. It’s also, they say, what differentiates him as dean.
“He understands the importance of communication and redundancy, and redundancy of communication, so that’s why he reiterates the mission every time he starts a meeting,” says Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. He laughs. “You know, it’s almost like the ‘Our Father’ at this point.”
“His thinking and the way he leads meetings and inspires us is very organizational,” adds Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean of Ivy Yard who worked with Khurana on the Academic Integrity Committee, which proposed the College’s first honor code. “He knows the purpose behind his words.”
Khurana says he developed his conception of the College’s mission through meetings with students and faculty and in studying the school’s history as he prepared for the deanship last spring.
“It’s not my vision,” Khurana is quick to say. “That mission was really something that was really more about rearticulating, I think, something that was always there.”
FACE TIME
Annenberg is Khurana’s dining hall of choice at lunchtime one Friday in early October. For all the lofty discussions about organizational behaviour and the state of higher education, Khurana likes to talk to students. By his count, he spends three-fourths of his time doing it.
After he grabs a green tray and silverware, Khurana jumps in the lunch line. Along the way, he greets a freshman and decides to join him and his friends for lunch. Conversation at the table quickly turns to politics: The night before, Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Institute of Politics, and Khurana and his son sat in the front row. The freshmen ask questions about the event. Khurana, in turn, takes out a blue notebook, quickly flips through its pages, and reads aloud his notes on the remarks for the benefit of the group.
Like his backpack, Khurana carries this notebook with him virtually everywhere—or, at least, he will until he fills it up. Since graduate school, he’s taken notes on conversations and observations in hardcover notebooks like this one; roughly 15 of them are shelved in his office at the Business School. His current notebook, the blue one with his name on the spine, is from a German brand. He used to buy Moleskines, but then they got “too popular.”
Thirty minutes later, Khurana and the freshmen have talked about everything from baseball to advice on buying proper winter boots (he’s a former Mets fan, and he recommends the waterproof, not the water-resistant, variety). Like this one, conversations with Khurana tend to veer off in all different directions. When the dean talks with students, and really everyone else, his jokes are generally self-deprecating. Coupled with his signature laugh—Stephanie Khurana’s favorite thing about her husband—even the most serious interactions with Khurana are likely to have their lighter moments.
Stokes-Rees describes Khurana as “student-focused,” a characterization to which he almost certainly would not object. He regularly begins his day with 7:30 a.m. breakfast in Annenberg and ends it with a couple hours at the student-run Cabot Café back in the Quad. “I think it’s really important as the dean of the College to be really in touch with where the students are,” Khurana says. 
The students, in fact, are a large part of why he took the job. He attributes much of his personal development to his time as a House master in Cabot. To serve both as the College’s top administrator and the head of a House means a tight schedule, but when he accepted the deanship, he and Stephanie chose to stay on in the Quad.
“It’s been a gift,” Khurana says, reflecting on the past few years there. “One of the decisions you make along the way and have no idea how impactful it would be—this was one of those. This was the way I got here.”
Mihir J. Chaudhary ’12, a resident tutor in Cabot, says that Khurana’s openness with students had a big effect on House culture when Chaudhary lived there as an undergraduate. “He was very willing to be vulnerable in front of students,” Chaudhary says. “He had this goofy dance that he did in front of students during Cabot Festivus, which is kind of our food and dance festival. He would participate a lot in the arm-wrestling competitions, the push-up competitions.”
ENTRENCHED IN HIERARCHY
In his quest to improve undergraduate education, Khurana hopes to advocate for the liberal arts during what he describes as an “inflection point” for the state of higher education, as technologies change quickly, college costs increase, and students feel pressured to learn professional skills in the classroom. Khurana calls for a focus on adjusting Harvard’s conception of a liberal arts education to the 21st century. In conversation, he compares the present juncture to the transitions ushered in by former University Presidents Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, and James Bryant Conant, Class of 1914. Both Conant and Eliot, a portrait of whom sits just outside Khurana’s office, introduced undergraduate curricular reforms, while Lowell developed Harvard’s residential House system and the academic concentration.
Unlike the former University leaders he now invokes, though, Khurana sits not at the helm of, but firmly entrenched in, Harvard’s bureaucratic structure. Regardless of his desire to run his office non-hierarchically, as dean of the College, Khurana is formally the superior of both the deans of student life and undergraduate education. But while College administrators can help shape the undergraduate curriculum, they hold little formal sway over the professors charged with applying it, who report not to Khurana, but to the man who hired him, FAS dean Smith.
Khurana was the main faculty member on the subcommittee that drafted the College’s new honor code, according to interim Administrative Board Secretary Brett Flehinger, but even that had to be approved by the Faculty before its implementation. In fact, faculty members debated the proposal at three of their monthly meetings last spring before it passed. Admissions and the renewal of the House system that Khurana envisions as the cornerstone of social life for undergraduates, similarly, fall under Smith’s jurisdiction.
Just last week, when Khurana took suggestions from students at a discussion about how the College could improve emergency email communications, he acknowledged that he and the College do not exist “in a vacuum,” but rather within the context of the FAS and central administrations, in addition to law enforcement. In other words, he could not promise to act on students’ requests on his own.
People in the Dean’s Office suggest that Khurana is aware of and open about his lack of pure policy-making power. His influence instead derives from his ability to work with the College’s various constituents and drive home what he sees as its mission, they say. To Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, “a lot” of Khurana’s job will be to set the tone.
“He’s putting himself, and his mission, really, on the line, and engaging people in a conversation that I think will take on momentum over the years and enhance his influence,” says Lassonde, the dean of student life. “He always says he has no power—the only power he has is moral suasion. And I think he really believes that—that you can really bring about change by influencing the conversation in important ways, in making [and] really forcing people to address the issues.”
As a lecturer at the Business School who studies organizational leadership, Snook agrees that constantly repeating one message, in this case the mission of the College, to tenured faculty and other administrators is Khurana’s best shot at effecting change.
“That’s how you get everyone aligned and moving in the same direction, when you really have very little formal authority,” Snook says. “You can’t coerce; you can’t fire.”
Khurana, for his part, speaks about his role thoughtfully later in his University Hall office. It goes back to being a student advocate, he says.
“I believe that having a College dean who’s also a House master and who deeply wants to support the students and also can work with the faculty is something that can perhaps help us move to a better place in terms of achieving our mission,” Khurana says. “Being dean was a choice about doing something to try to make our students’ lives better, and to be a voice for them and to bring that perspective of living with them, and hearing them and dining with them and spending time with them, to an important role that can help shape their experience.”
TEACHING FROM BEHIND
What power Khurana has, he is determined to distribute among people below him. In line with his intellectual propensity to distrust concentrated authority, he describes his leadership philosophy as enabling other people to make the decisions that most affect them, instead of making them himself; in his own words, he is a democrat with a “little ‘d.’” Colleagues say this stems, in part, from his near-total trust in others.
In Cabot, this meant that he supported projects like the creation of Cabot Café while letting students take charge. Stokes-Rees, the former resident dean, says Khurana and Stephanie are focused on students in the House without wanting to do everything for them.
Since Khurana became dean of the College, this philosophy has already manifested in at least two decisions that affected day-to-day student life. Given his outspoken prioritization of the House system, one might assume that Khurana played a large part in effecting the recent change to Inter-House dining restrictions, which essentially asks students not to eat outside their own Houses on Thursdays. Not so, says Khurana; the House masters collectively came to that decision after the dean recused himself from the deliberations.
“He’s not really restructuring the Dean’s Office,” says Adams House Master Sean Palfrey ’67. “But I do think what he’s trying to do is simplify the lines of decision-making about undergraduate life ... so that the House Masters have a simpler line to his organization, the Dean’s Office.”
Similarly, when a student-administrator committee on student group transportation safety presented its recommendations to Khurana earlier this semester, he increased funding for domestic student group travel grants by $30,000 and instructed the group to determine how those grants should be allocated.
“In nearly every decision in all five years that we’ve know him, he always tries to see how [decision-making power] can be pushed down,” says Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe, who sat on the alcohol policy committee that Khurana chaired. “He was always turning it around and saying, let’s let the students write the policy, let’s have neighborhood meetings to see if students have input, let’s have the students do this.”
This style reflects what Business School professors point to as the defining characteristic of Rakesh Khurana, the professor. Instead of dictating to students at the front of the school’s classic semicircle classrooms, Khurana deliberately teaches from the back of the room, amplifying the student voice by diminishing his own.
Khurana says he started teaching that way after reading John Dewey’s work on the purpose of education. When asked why he does, he says slowly, “I believe the goal of education is to prepare people to teach themselves and that my role is to facilitate and help them have that capacity to do that and to engage with each other, and for me to slowly fade away in the process.”
COMMUNICATING THE NEW WAY
When a racially charged death threat hit hundreds of students’ inboxes a few days into October, Khurana faced the first major campus disruption of his deanship. Students, dissatisfied that their new dean had not yet sent the full student body a message acknowledging the nature of the threat, criticized the administration’s response.
For Khurana, the episode was a first test of his leadership technique. While two other deans in his office had reached out to all undergraduates in the days immediately following the threat, Khurana did not. Under the conception of a Dean’s Office composed of a group of equally important administrators, an email from Khurana would not have carried more weight. But some students wanted to hear from the dean, if only because his job title placed him above the rest.
The day after students aired their grievances at a community discussion event, Khurana called Crimson reporters into University Hall and assumed full blame. Referencing prepared notes, he vowed to improve communication in times of crisis, then added, unprompted, that the incident had also convinced him of the general need to better inform students about the inner workings of his office. He had planned to lead by example, he said, but now realized that students might need a more explicit explanation of his non-hierarchical philosophy. He sent them an email about the threat later that day.
As the College prepares to implement its first-ever honor code, embarks on an ongoing review of its General Education curriculum, and faces a federal probe into its adherence to Title IX, Khurana is trying to change the way its administration functions and communicate that difference to students along the way.
Back in University Hall last Friday, after hosting a separate, follow-up discussion in Phillips Brooks House about communications in the wake of the threat, the typically quick-talking dean slows down.
“This is requiring a lot of work for me, to be honest. But I believe that having those [dean and House master] positions, I can bring a credibility to saying what I think we need to do and what I hear from the students what we need to do to improve their lives,” Khurana says deliberately. “I’m only a few weeks into this job, and at the end of the day, I think this is a unique opportunity for me to bring that perspective. … I want to first build the trust of the community, and I need to have some time to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and administrators discussed the intentions of the Program in General Education and areas for improvement in a town hall-style discussion Wednesday in Cabot House, marking the third of four meetings intended to help a committee charged with reviewing the program better understand how students are experiencing Gen Ed.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who both appointed Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly in December to spearhead the review process, attended to listen to students reflect on the program. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana attended the last 30 minutes of the meeting.
While only four undergraduates and one graduate student attended the meeting, Kelly said many more had attended the previous meetings in Quincy House and Eliot House.
Students were divided on what the purpose of the program should be, some mentioning that they thought the program cultivated skill sets and prompted self-reflection, while others said they thought Gen Ed mainly introduced students to different ways of thinking.
“I think what [Gen Ed] does is make sure that someone doesn’t get through college only doing [computer science], or history,” Alexa M. Oord ’17 said during the discussion. “But it should do more, because I went to a liberal arts school so the culture of exploration and open-mindedness would be encouraged.”
Harris said that the purpose of the program wasn’t just to expose students to skill sets, but to teach students to approach subjects in different ways.
“The theory is that Gen Ed courses are not just engagement with a particular topic, but a specific type of engagement that is built around a certain pedagogy, a certain set of questions,” Harris said.
Those in attendance focused on the language of the 2007 legislation that created the program, which states that one of its goals is to inspire students to become “engaged citizens locally, nationally, and internationally.”
“That seems sort of final, like saying, ‘Here is the context you can go be a citizen of the world with,’” said David R. Palmer ’16, who was in favor of creating more foundational courses for the program. “The aim sounds great, but I think it makes more sense to start from the ground instead of making it to the end.”
Students expressed interest in administrators publishing a document delineating how Gen Ed courses are proposed and approved and suggested that professors of Gen Ed courses explicitly define the goals of their courses in their syllabi.
On that topic, Khurana wondered whether or not faculty members assume that students fully understand the purpose of a course.
“I think we often take for granted that students know what [instructors] are trying to get across,” Khurana said.
After the last town hall meeting for students, which will be held on Oct. 22 in Strauss Hall’s common room, the review committee will hold meetings for faculty and teaching fellows.
The committee will finish its report in the spring and then give it to Smith for further review, according to Kelly.
“I think these meetings are critical to understanding where we are in the program,” Smith said after the event, adding that he would wait until the committee created its review to comment on the state of the program as it exists today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year of preparation, the Center for Sustainable Buildings and Cities, based at the Graduate School of Design, will hold an official launch event in November, the University announced in a press release Tuesday.
Although the center has been open since last November, its staff and affiliates will begin researching at the center and developing new design strategies to create more sustainable buildings and cities next month, said Richard B. Freeman, a professor of Economics and co-director of the center.
The center was supported by a gift from the Evergrande Real Estate Group, an investment holding company headquartered in Guangzhou, China.
As part of the same gift, Evergrande also gave Harvard money to establish the Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital as well as the Center for Mathematical Sciences and Applications in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The University has not released information regarding the value of the gift.
Ali Malkawi, a professor of architectural technology and the center’s founding director, said that the center’s research will focus on the design component of sustainability.
“We are moving the topic slightly from [a] completely engineering-dominated world...to design-driven solutions that would enable us to hopefully have much more impact into the way that buildings are designed, constructed, and operated, with the intention to have lower impact [on] the environment,” he said.
Freeman, who will spearhead the center’s social and economic research, emphasized the center’s focus on the economic and business components in constructing healthy and safe buildings and cities.
“There are many more people in the world that can benefit aside from Harvard,” Freeman said of the center’s research goals.
The new center will host multidisciplinary research to explore issues ranging from the development of new materials for building design to urban planning, according to the press release.
The center currently occupies a pre-1940 house at 20 Sumner Road in Cambridge, a block northeast of Gund Hall. Malkawi said that he hopes the house can serve as a “living lab” for the center.
“The reason we chose that house is that there are a few million homes that are similar in style in the U.S.,” Malkawi said. “We want to retrofit the house to be a positive energy house and use it as an example for what can be done.”
Malkawi also mentioned that the center hopes to pursue a partnership with the Office of Sustainability, noting opportunities for the center’s role in campus expansion.
“We hope that at some point it will trickle into the actual living spaces that we might have [at Harvard],” Malkawi said.
University administrators and leaders from multiple disciplines will convene for the Inaugural Challenge Conference at GSD on Nov. 7 to examine new strategies for sustainable building and apply them to global environmental issues.

The Office of Student Life will prioritize funding domestic student travel that it determines aligns with the “College’s mission” when it allocates $50,000 in grants to traveling students and student groups this academic year, according to the grant application that opened this week.
The grants, offered through the Dean of Harvard College Student Life Fund, are part of a pilot program to increase funding for domestic student travel by $30,000. Last year, administrators offered traveling student groups $20,000 through the Fund, but Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana increased that sum this semester in response to the recommendations of a working group on student group transportation safety.
College administrators created the working group last spring after an undergraduate, Angela R. Mathew, died in a car crash while returning to campus from a mock trial competition in February. After consulting with Khurana last month, the students and administrators in the working group determined the criteria for allocating the additional funds.
According to a description of the Student Life Fund posted on the OSL’s website, administrators will prioritize proposed group travel activities that are “aligned with the College’s Mission to support experiences that foster intellectual, social, and personal transformation,” a reference to language Khurana has used to describe his vision for the College. It does not, however, detail what such travel might look like.
The application asks students to explain how their travel plans align with the missions of the College and their student group. Acknowledging that this is an “open question,” Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich said he is “interested to hear what students say” in response.
According to the posted description, the College also plans to prioritize funding student groups that “support efforts to utilize safer travel options”—namely, public or charter transportation. It will also put travel plans that fall “within the current scope of an organization’s travel activities” first. Friedrich said the working group put that stipulation in place to make sure that the funding increase is used to encourage student groups to travel more safely, rather than to travel more.
"The intent of this money is not to finance more student travel; it's to finance safer alternatives for travel that's already being done," said Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a member of the working group and an Undergraduate Council representative for Quincy House.
A group of administrators and students, including members of the working group, will review applications. Chosen student organizations must register their travel plans with administrators to receive funding, and members of groups that rent a vehicle to drive must take a driver safety course online.
This semester’s application will remain open until Oct. 26. In addition to other student groups, individual students traveling to academic conferences to present research and club sports teams are eligible to apply.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six professors discussed the diversity of history and its everyday implications during the third annual “History is Everything, Everything is History” talk Wednesday afternoon.
A tradition of the History department, the event aims to provide students with an overview of the resources offered by the concentration.
“We come together as a department in order to present some of the greatest work that we are doing here in and beyond the classroom,” said History professor Maya Jasanoff, who moderated the event.
The event highlighted the interconnected relationship between history and daily life.
“Some of the people in the history department found out that history suffered from an emergent problem—people think it’s all about the past,” Jasanoff said. “But it’s really about the present and the future.”
Panelists described their different research fields, from classics to Turkish studies, to convey the diversity of historical studies. They also discussed current events, such as the Ferguson riots, from a historical perspective.
“Part of reason why history is everything is that history is cyclical,” said assistant professor of History Elizabeth K. Hinton. “Ferguson and history show us that giving the police more weapons does not make us safer. That historical cycle must be broken.”
Another topic was China’s one-child policy. Michael Szonyi, chair of the Committee on Regional Studies East Asia, used demographic statistics to show that China’s fertility rate would dramatically decrease in the future. He argued that “historical lessons could have been learned but were not,” from this case study.
“We now know that this is a mistake caused by ignorance of history,” Szonyi said.
The event attracted both undergraduate and graduate students. Ian J. Miller, a professor of History and director of undergraduate studies, said he was glad to see the event improve from year to year.
“What we are very eager to do is to illustrate the diversity of the concentration,” Miller said. “It is a little glimpse of the future.”

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study opened the doors of Schlesinger Library Wednesday to showcase writings from individuals who lived during the Civil War.
Dean of the Radcliffe Institute Lizabeth Cohen, University President Drew G. Faust, and Kathy A. Jacob ’72, the curator of manuscripts at the Schlesinger Library, addressed more than 100 attendees at the grand opening of the exhibit, “What They Wrote, What They Saved."
“The Schlesinger Library’s rich collections of family and household papers, letters, and diaries offer us moving glimpses into the profoundly personal impact of the war,” Cohen said during her introduction. “We read tender and reassuring letters from fathers, brothers, and sons at the battlefield. We hear the weary—and worried—voices of mothers, daughters, and sisters who were left to soldier on at home without them.”
The library presented stories with this human element in mind. Each story presented a particular voice, but was part of a larger story—the human story of the Civil War. During her portion of the presentation, Faust highlighted how the act of writing helped shape that story.
“Putting things into words makes people see their feelings in more explicit ways and articulate those feelings in more explicit ways,” Faust said. “So in some ways it changes the nature of relationships as words become the only vehicle for intimacies that might be expressed in other forms if people were in the same place and together.”
The displays showcased a variety of communications, including confessions of courtly love, husbands making sure that their wives kept up with the housework, and even drawings from soldiers. Other communications included instances of soldiers venting about their emotional struggles during the war. There were also photographs, carefully preserved, that gave faces to the stories being told.
The exhibition was displayed in one room, with seven transparent cases protecting the first-hand accounts of the war and labels beside each giving descriptions of each piece.
“They’re hugely constrained by the space. And with only seven cases, to have to whittle it down...and sort of have to figure out what themes they could possibly cover in such limited space, I think they did a really effective job at that,” said Laura Microulis, a historian who is writing her dissertation at Bard College and attended Wednesday's opening.
The exhibition reflects the changing perspective on the Civil War, Faust said during her remarks. Historians recognize that the war was not just about political justifications, economic consequences, or notable generals.
“Warfare is of course about the power of guns, but I think we see in this exhibit how it was also about the power of words. And those words are ours, still, to understand, to read, to learn from,” Faust said.

UPDATED: October 19, 2014, at 1:05 p.m.
Past midnight on Wednesday morning, Rachel P. Thompson ’16 sat outside the Science Center with nothing but an empty square of blue tape pasted on the ground behind her.
“What would you do to change the prison system?” asked the hand-drawn sign on an easel in front of her.
From 9 p.m. on Tuesday until 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, Thompson and around 20 other students took shifts sitting beside a seven-by-nine-foot box, which represented a prison cell, as part of a vigil for prisoners held in solitary confinement.
The student vigil, which was called 7x9, lasted for over 22 hours, including the few hours demonstrators were forced to move inside the Science Center beginning at 1:00 a.m. to avoid paying for security on the plaza.
The box was designed to mirror the size of the average solitary cell, according to Student Alliance for Prison Reform, a national network of college students that aims to raise awareness and public discourse on prison conditions.
The movement began at Princeton, and seven other campuses participated in the event Wednesday.
Unlike demonstrations at other colleges, Harvard’s vigil featured student protesters giving information about life in solitary confinement.
“At other schools they’ll have a student standing in the box and not saying anything,” Thompson said. “But we wanted to make it more like a vigil, standing in solidarity but not trying to replicate an experience we’ve never had.”
Protest leader Eva Shang ’17 stressed the importance of Harvard students learning more about issues of prison life and solitary confinement.
“When people are in solitary confinement, they are rendered in complete isolation in the cell for 22 to 24 hours of the day,” Shang said. “There is little or no access to rehabilitative or education programming and grossly inadequate medical and mental health treatment.”
Shang also cited that nearly 50 percent of prison suicides occur among the 4 percent of the U.S. prison population currently in solitary confinement.
“It’s absolutely inhumane and should violate our basic human sensibilities,” Shang said.
Both Thompson and Shang have worked with prisoners in the Cambridge community through educational programs and said they tried to leverage their experiences when planning the demonstration.
“We’ve had input from prisoners who have been directly affected,” Thompson said. “We don’t want to speak for people whose voices have been silenced. We want to give them the platform so they can speak for themselves.”
Shang and other 7x9 organizers on campus are currently working with the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, as well as Solitary Watch and the Stop Mass Incarceration Network, to form a broader movement for prison reform.
“In the public sphere, we hope to send a signal to the world that college students around the country care about human rights abuses,” Shang said.
By Wednesday afternoon, sheets of easel paper in front of the blue tape rectangle were filled with multi-colored suggestions for prison reform from students and local community members alike.

UPDATED: October 16, 2014, at 3:30 p.m.
The Harvard Coop announced last Tuesday that it would offer a 9 percent rebate to its over 30,000 members for all purchases made in the 2014 fiscal year. The rebate checks are available for pickup until the end of October at the Coop’s Harvard Square location.
Although the Coop saw a slight decline of 0.2 percent in revenue over the past year, Coop president Jeremiah P. Murphy, Jr. ’73 said that tight inventory and expense control, among other factors, allowed the institution to raise its rebate this year.
“The Coop was able to take advantage of the increased visitor traffic, particularly during the summer months and strengthen its position as a destination store in both its Harvard Square and Kendall Square locations,” Murphy said in a statement released last Tuesday.
The 9 percent rebate is a slight increase from the 8.8 percent offered in 2013 and marks the last year that members will receive an end-of-year rebate on purchases. After 131 years of rebates, the Coop announced that, beginning in the 2015 fiscal year, members would instead receive a 10 percent instant discount on all items including textbooks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William Xiao ’16 just needed to send a quick email before settling into a problem set around 10 p.m. one Monday in early September.
But as he sat in his Eliot House dorm room, keeping an eye on his inbox, the email did not come through. Xiao, who also serves as president of the Harvard Computer Society—the group that manages more than 7,000 student mailing lists—quickly realized his night was not going to turn out as planned.
As Xiao began to receive text and Facebook messages from friends concerned about why their emails were not sending, HCS board member Roger Zou ’17 trekked to 1414 Mass. Ave, where the society keeps its physical servers, tucked above Bank of America and CVS. He aimed to restart Virgil, the filer that stores all the data for HCS-hosted lists. At that point Virgil had been down for several hours, quieting hundreds if not thousands of active lists and websites on campus.
When Zou reached 1414 Mass. Ave, which primarily houses Harvard University Information Technology servers, he faced a series of “mission impossible” obstacles: a locked entrance, a terminal computer that needed a passcode, and a mesh cage that housed the servers themselves. Receiving instructions via a video call with Xiao, Xiao’s predecessor Saagar Deshpande ’14, and Deshpande’s predecessor, Zou identified the correct metal gray machine, and together they restarted the filer around 1 a.m..
“When the filer is running, fans are going off, and you can hear this constant buzzing,” Zou said. “Everything, everything went silent for two seconds. And then it started running up again, and a lot of lights began flashing.”
As the incident, the first in recent memory that blacked out of all of HCS’s services, suggests, the stakes for Harvard Computer Society are high. Run by five College students, the society is the only undergraduate-driven organization in the Ivy League that serves as the predominant web hosting and emailing list provider for other student groups. For Harvard students, HCS’s services are a cornerstone of daily communication.
As more clubs demand an online presence, HCS members say that its now-antiquated infrastructure can hardly support those requests—leading to a series of headaches like the early September blackout. With those headaches in mind, the more than 30-year-old club is finalizing a transition from its on-campus servers to the cloud and readying for the next phase of its service.
A MASSIVE REACH
Although most widely known for the algorithmic “DataMatch”—a personalized list of romantic potentials distributed on Valentine’s Day—Harvard Computer Society impacts almost every undergraduate’s life on a daily basis.
Among the thousands of mailing lists under HCS’s helm, including “quadlings,” “ghungroo-production-14,” “mather-official,” “culinary-discuss,” and “cabot-thesis,” lies the means of reaching those belonging to a certain theater production, academic field, House, or even those with a penchant for Japanese anime. The club also hosts at least dozens of active club websites.
“Most people don’t even know that HCS runs a lot of this in the background,” Deshpande, last year’s HCS president, said. “They assume, ‘Oh, there’s a House mailing list, and Harvard runs it,’ but they don’t connect the dots that actually a group of students are doing a lot of it.”
According to Deshpande, at its founding in 1983, HCS intended to teach its peers about early technology, publishing a magazine that would review the latest gadgets. That changed about 15 years ago, when the group transitioned from providing students a venue for discussion to providing actual services on club-owned servers.
While other means of web hosting have emerged over the years, HCS offers one of the only ways for a Harvard student group to host a website free of charge and avoid third-party fees that can approach $100 per year.
Zachary Hamed ’14, a former HCS member, delved into the archives of “HCS-jobs”—a mailing list for technical recruiters to advertise employment opportunities and students to find partners for side projects—and said that the oldest emails he could find were from 2000, around the year group members estimate was the starting point of HCS’s mailing list administration.
Today, HCS’s database holds more than 160,000 unique email addresses, though that count includes addresses for graduated students and fake or incorrect addresses that have not been pruned out, according to Xiao.
“We touch everything and have a massive reach at Harvard,” Xiao said.
According to James H. Waldo, Harvard’s chief technology officer and HCS’s faculty advisor, HUIT has no “official” relationship with the club, but does house its servers and pays for the “minimal” cost of providing electricity to the machines. As an advisor, Waldo said he connects the undergraduates with faculty members who have appropriate expertise when the group seeks guidance, but has no role in how they manage or administer the club.
“They are a non-professional organization doing a professional job,” Waldo said. He added that in his personal view, he appreciates that a student organization could put up its website without University oversight or bureaucracy.
While the scale of the operation is a constant challenge, board members say that the experience of administering student lists and websites mimics a professional setting that cannot be found elsewhere on campus.
“HUIT has given us a fantastic opportunity. There would be no other way for students to interact with such a wide-ranging systems base except through HCS,” Zou said. “I have really appreciated the learning experience.”
Deshpande echoed Zou’s sentiment, saying that his time working with the student organization was “an experience pretty difficult to get outside of working at a company.”
NEAR CAPACITY
As the number of student lists has proliferated over the years and email volume has increased, HCS members say their system’s current hardware and software iteration has been under increasing stress. That has translated into more issues for the members of the five-man management board to address.
For example, Xiao said that the help request mechanism for users to notify the group of a malfunctioning service or for assistance on a technical problem has an estimated three-month backlog.
“We are getting near the capacity of what we can handle in terms of clubs,” Xiao said. “I could imagine one to two full-time people just working on this, or another full-time person whose main job is to manage servers for Harvard’s clubs.”
Part of the problem is that the club is still running six-year-old software, which likely contributed to Virgil’s failure, according to Deshpande.
“It’s been increasingly difficult to maintain it especially since it’s getting more costly to provide replacement parts,” Deshpande said. “It’s like buying an old car. People also no longer send out patches to fix bugs in the software.”
In the meantime, the aspiring engineers have found ways to mitigate the capacity problem until they can completely rebuild the database from the ground up. According to Xiao, the current database reaches 95 percent of capacity at the end of each day, so the club runs a set of instructions which delete junk data. This high volume puts the database at risk of crashing if hackers clog one of its hosted sites.
“Every once in a while, it doesn’t clear in time before it hits that 100 percent, and everything crashes,” Xiao said. “Things are going to break, and that’s something we accept as a student organization. There’s not much we can do.”
TRANSITIONING TO THE CLOUD
This convergence of database and hardware problems led HCS leaders last spring to conclude the organization would be best served by transferring all its data from physical servers on campus to the cloud.
The group expects to transfer all services over to Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing platform, by the end of October. Former HCS presidents Deshpande and Salvatore Rinchiera ’14 spearheaded the project.
“The big push is for us to get to a brand new set of systems and update all of the software and hardware. For a lot of work moving forward in the next 10 years, people are very heavily going to be using cloud,” Deshpande said. “It’s a necessity, but it’s also the most practical thing to do.”
Waldo, for his part, said that he particularly aimed to push the club away from its current machinery, which he called “not so current.” According to Waldo, HUIT will continue to fund HCS by paying for its cloud services, but he expected the cost to be the same if not lower than what it is now.
For the five-person board, moving to the cloud will mean relief from the responsibility of fixing physical breaks and coordinating with HUIT to enter Harvard’s server room.
The initiative will also allow the group to easily upgrade and update its services, have minimal server downtime, and potentially lower costs.
“The goal of this transition, this migration, is for the inners of HCS to change and become more updated and for everyone else to feel like things are the same,” Deshpande said. He noted that a new feature will allow users to login to club accounts with their Harvard ID rather than an old unique password given to them at sign-up.
“With the new setup, when we are running an event like DataMatch, we can pay for a little more capacity. But during summer or Christmas break when people aren’t using our services, we can turn off some of the servers,” Deshpande said. “As prices go down on the cloud, it will be a lot easier and simpler to maintain these things in the long run.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve-year-old Elizabeth Fitzhenry, like most American girls her age, did not think of summer camp as preparation to represent their country. She was wrong.
Flashback to the summer of 2005. Fitzhenry had found out that all of her friends were going to crew camp, and she simply could not miss out on the fun.
“I started rowing in seventh grade,” Fitzhenry said. “I did ‘learn to row’ camp with a bunch of my friends, and I decided to keep at it. It was pretty much my first sport.”
The Saratoga Springs, N.Y., native had played soccer and done ballet, but hadn’t found her calling in either of those activities. When she took to the water, however, it was love at first stroke.
What started out as a way to join her friends at summer camp turned into a fervent passion. This weekend, Fitzhenry will captain the Radcliffe heavyweight team’s varsity eight at the Head of the Charles Regatta.
After a 10-year career filled with medals and honors, the senior has nearly done it all.
In 2011, Fitzhenry captured three golds at the Canadian Henley Championship in St. Catherines, Ont.
“It was really an interesting experience,” Fitzhenry said. “It was my first international regatta. It was weird to hear them call your names at the start and they were like, ‘Germany! France! USA!’ and we’re used to, ‘Harvard! Princeton! Yale!’”
Fitzhenry’s intensity and work ethic made a quick impression on her rowing partner, Kristina Wagner, a senior rower at Yale.
“My first impression of Lizzy was probably [that I was] intimidated, but in a good way,” said Wagner. “I knew I wanted to be friends with her, but she also scared me a little.”
Fitzhenry’s affable nature, however, quickly won over Wagner.
“[Fitzhenry] is the best rowing partner ever,” Wagner said. “She’s the peanut butter to my jelly.”
The dynamic duo won the Junior, Under-23, and Championship women’s pair races at Canadian Henley.
Away from the boathouse, Fitzhenry is an avid reader. She took an interest in literature at a young age with the encouragement of her parents.
“My parents always have some book that they are reading, so it was something I saw all the time,” Fitzhenry said.
Though she was always interested in books, her love began with the stories her mother read to her on road trips.
“We used to go on really long car trips with my family,” Fitzhenry said. “So my mom read the Harry Potter books aloud to [me and my siblings], and eventually we took over reading them ourselves.”
When she does not have an oar in her hand, the senior can usually be found with a book. The English concentrator’s favorite novels include Emma by Jane Austen and Assault on Lake Casitas by Brad Alan Lewis.
This year will most likely mark the end of Fitzhenry’s crew career. While her teammates will celebrate the legacy she will leave, they also currently admire her for her passions out of the water.
“Lizzy is one of my role models,” Wagner said. “The thought of letting Lizzy down is worse than letting myself down. She pushes me in the best way possible.”
“She is an amazing friend,” added Wagner, who will be lining up against Fitzhenry this weekend on the Charles. “I know she will be my best friend for the rest of my life. She’s actually the best, even if she does go to Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Cameron Winklevoss ’04 climbed into a freshman heavyweight boat for his first collegiate race, he was wearing a prison uniform.
He was not the only one. In the boat with Winklevoss sat seven other Harvard rowers and a coxswain, all donning the striped shirt of a jailed inmate. It was the 2000 Head of the Charles, and the group had chosen this outfit a few days before the race.
The unusual style did not hinder the performance of the boat. Urged on by a partisan Harvard crowd, the Winklevoss twins’ boat started fast and got faster, ultimately breaking the freshman heavyweight course record by five seconds.
As unique as the moment may have felt, at least one aspect was comparatively ordinary—the choice of clothing. A prison shirt may make a rower stand out on an average day, but during the Head of the Charles Regatta—when hordes of oarsmen descend on Cambridge in superhero outfits, spray-painted t-shirts, monster costumes, matching polo pullovers, and neon socks—wearing stripes seems rather unremarkable.
Among the many traditions that give character to the Head of the Charles, the tendency of teams to dress in quirky outfits is both the most noticeable and the least explicable. At no point did an official decree encourage, or even suggest, that teams should create specialized uniforms. Instead, the tradition has emerged and evolved on its own.
One explanation of the origin of the costumes is the event’s proximity to Halloween. Since 1965, the start of the annual races, the Head of the Charles has occurred in mid-October. Yet some, such as Harvard assistant coach Patrick Lapage ’12, argue that the flashy style of the Regatta simply reflects the nature of the fall rowing season.
“Fall isn’t really the serious time of year for us,” Lapage said. “It’s good to get a measure of where you are, but the real racing season is the spring. That’s where our focus is.”
As a heavyweight rower with Harvard while an undergraduate, Lapage had four years of dress-up experience himself. But his strongest memory of costumes at the races came from last season, his first as coach, when one heavyweight team imitated a pirate ship.
“Their coxswain had a big beard and a parrot,” Lapage said. “Most of the guys just ended up buying girls’ blouses, which was pretty funny.”
The 2013 boat was not the only recent team to adopt the marauder theme. In 2005, a heavyweight varsity four competed in eye patches, gold hoop earrings, and bandanas. That same year saw a Crimson boat decked out in medical scrubs, face masks included.
Costumes such as these comprise one category of HOCR dress. Only at the Head of the Charles can a spectator see a shell containing the Hulk, Luigi, and Batman—a 2011 Harvard entry—push ahead of a shell filled with the colors of the rainbow, each one represented in t-shirt form.
For those who do not wish to impersonate a cartoon character, the bizarre clothing custom has a second category: personalized t-shirts. These shirts typically have similar designs—some personalized note scrawled across the back, often in spray paint—but teams have used shirts to convey vastly different messages.
Consider the 2002 Radcliffe heavyweights, who protested an NCAA rule requiring all sports teams to take off seven weeks by creating shirts with the design of a crossed-out seven. Similarly, the 2011 Harvard heavyweight first boat celebrated late coach Harry Parker’s then-50 years at the helm of the program by spray-painting shirts spelling out “50 Years” as a group.
Lightweight captain Alexander Bonorris explained that such t-shirts are more popular than costumes among lightweight boats.
In a past iteration, Bonorris’ boat wore matching shirts with “H170” on them, poking fun at the extra pounds—lightweight rowers have to be under 160 pound—the oarsmen had put on during the fall.
“We don’t have a plan as to what we will wear yet this year,” Bonorris said. “Usually it comes together around the last minute.”
A reason for the improvisational nature of the shirts is that athletes get to decide what to wear on their own. As long as the outfits don’t get in the way of rowing, coaches won’t interfere.
“[The boats] just kind of do it themselves,” Lapage said. “We don’t really give them any guidance. Just something that’s not totally ridiculous.”
The tradition of costumes stretches back three decades. A 1983 article in The Crimson mentioned that some rowers chose to wear “Mickey Mouse hats and Halloween masks” and that fans threw beer cans to the oarsmen after the race had ended that year.
As distracting as some outfits might be, they contribute to an environment that is unique to the Head of the Charles.
“You can definitely feel the atmosphere when you get to the start line,” senior heavyweight Charles Risbey said. “It’s not often you get to row in front of hundreds of thousands of people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe crew team looks to build on its momentum from a successful 2014 spring season at the Head of the Charles this weekend, its second—and most important—race of the fall.
The fall season provides the squad with four major races and serves as a tune-up for the more competitive spring schedule, which begins in early April. Fall races are much longer distances—typically between 4,000 and 5,000 meters—while races in the spring are all 2,000 meter sprints.
Over the summer, each heavyweight rower had to complete the Million Meter Challenge, a competition implemented by co-captains Lizzie Fitzhenry and Jenny Wong that challenged the oarswomen to complete one million meters of rowing on ergometer machines during their break.
The team created a spreadsheet in which rowers could input their progress and encourage their teammates.
“I think this [challenge] really set us up for a strong start to the season,” senior Eliza Flint said. “Everyone was fit and ready to go. At the beginning of the semester, we’ve had some solid practices. The most important thing is that everyone has put in a lot of hard work over the summer, which has really set us up on a solid platform in order to train for the beginning of the season.”
The Black and White heavyweights finished 13th at last year’s NCAA championships in Indianapolis, Ind., where Ohio State took home gold, while Radcliffe finished behind two Ivy League foes: Brown, which placed third, and Princeton, which took sixth. This year’s team returns many core members, including Wong, Fitzhenry, and Flint, as well as juniors Freddie Archibald, Mary Carmack, Erin Slatery, and Lauren Tracey.
The Head of the Charles Regatta will be the team’s second race of the fall after a strong performance last Saturday at the Head of the Housatonic.
Radcliffe will enter two boats in this weekend’s championship eight race, which will occur on Sunday at 2:18 p.m.
“The Head of the Charles is very exciting for us,” Flint said. “It’s very nice to be racing on our home course and to have competitors come from all over the world to race here.”
The lightweight team, meanwhile, enters the season hoping to defend its national title at the 2014 IRA Championships. Second-year coach Lou Berl will guide a crew that returns six seniors.
The Black and White will have one boat in the varsity lightweight four race and two boats in the varsity lightweight eight race this weekend.
On the Charles, Radcliffe will compete against 33 of the nation’s top programs, including all seven Ancient Eight opponents, in a challenging three-mile course down the river. Last year, the top Radcliffe heavyweight eight boat finished seventh behind champion Cambridge Boat Club and archrival Yale, which finished fifth.
The course for this weekend’s race is one of the most challenging in the country and makes life difficult for each team’s coxswain. The race starts at Boston University and features five bridges over the three-mile course. Time penalties are assessed if boats do not stay between buoys or assigned bridge arches. The boats pass Radcliffe’s Weld Boathouse approximately halfway through the course.
“Head of the Charles is definitely notoriously known as one of the most difficult courses to steer, and it’s very much known as a coxswain’s race,” Wong said. “I feel very lucky to have it as our home course and practice on it everyday. We get to pass Weld during the race. It’s where we work hard everyday, and we have supporters there.”
In addition, the teams will travel to Princeton on Nov. 1 for the Collegiate Small Boat Challenge and then return home for the Foot of the Charles on Nov. 15.
Radcliffe’s third race of the season provides a different experience for the rowers. The Collegiate Small Boat Challenge only allows singles and doubles for sculling and pairs for sweeping. Most regattas feature these races, but are highlighted by races featuring larger boats. Last year at Princeton, Radcliffe placed fifth and ninth in the pair race, and third and tenth in the double category.
The season culminates in the Foot of the Charles. Though it occurs on the same course as the Head of the Charles, it is a much smaller race than its earlier counterpart and features three sweeping races—the varsity four, the novice eight, and the varsity eight.
In its 2013 outing at the Foot of the Charles, Radcliffe finished second behind Syracuse in the varsity four, won the novice eight race, and was fourth in the varsity eight.
Despite a busy schedule for the rest of the season, the team’s primary focus is on its home races this weekend. For the seniors, it will be their last time representing Radcliffe at this world-renowned event.
“Head of the Charles is definitely one of my favorite races,” Wong said. “Every year, it’s just such a good experience. I think there’s some sentimentality for me since it’s my last one, and it’s our home course. I try to bring my best performance to every race, and that will definitely be no different this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With hundreds of athletes and thousands of spectators flocking to the banks of the Charles River for one of the most well-known regattas in the world, the Harvard heavyweight and lightweight men are looking to make strong starts to their 2014-2015 competition seasons at this year’s Head of the Charles.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Crimson heavyweights plan to build upon their success under the leadership of Charley Butt in his second year as head coach.
The team finished its spring season undefeated in dual regattas and picked up the Stein, Compton, and Adams Cups in addition to a first-place finish at the EARC sprints.
With these accomplishments coming during Butt’s first year, the heavyweights are looking to improve upon last season’s impressive showing over the course of the coming campaign.
“Last year was a huge change for all of us, with Charley coming in,” captain Max Meyer-Bosse said. “I think we kind of realized after the season was over that there were things that went really smoothly in that transition, and other things that we could work on. So I think this year the focus is [to] keep the things going that we had last year, and try to improve upon the things where we had room for it.”
The crew returns an experienced group. Junior Vincent Breet, sophomore Chase Buchholz, and several other veterans competed at various international regattas this summer, often ending up on the medal podium.
“Training has been great so far,” Meyer-Bosse said. “We have a really strong freshman class this year, and the sophomores who had already had such a big presence on the team last year are really continuing with that. We have a lot of strong leaders this year as well, so all around the morale in the boat house is pretty high going into this competition season.”
The 2014 Head of the Charles Regatta will provide an opportunity for the squad to set the tone for the season.
“When it comes down to it, all crews are going to try to throw down their fastest heat at HOCR,” Meyer-Bosse said. “Head Of the Charles is a goal point for us. It’s something that we can really focus on right now. But at the same time, we are always trying to take things one day at a time, one race at a time.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Coming back from its own strong spring season, the lightweight crew has its work cut out for it.
“Last year, we started the season off with high hopes and expectations,” captain Alexander Bonorris said. “We finished second in varsity eight at Head of the Charles and 2V got fifth, so those are both really strong finishes…. We had an uphill battle last spring, which is the important racing season for us, but our team overall finished really strong.”
Last year’s second place finish at IRA championships has kept motivation high for the Crimson, which looks to reach the top of the stand this year.
“In training this year, you can definitely tell that there’s a bit more urgency,” Bonorris said. “We are doing more focused work, and I would say that we are very well prepped for the upcoming races. [Coach Michiel] Bartman has done a great job setting a really professional tone right off the bat, and you can see the results.”
This will be Bartman’s second Head of the Charles as coach of the lightweight men, while assistant coaches Kristen Brownlee and Ian Accomando play new parts to the squad this year.
“The mindset is that we are returning a good amount of our varsity eight, 2V, and 3V,” Bonorris said. “We were so close to the gold, and we were so close to that national championship. So we just need to work harder, and we know that it’s within reach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes circumstances evolve in a way few would expect.
That’s how some of the incoming recruits to the Harvard men’s lightweight crew of the Class of 2018 felt when they received word that longtime freshmen coach Linda Muri was leaving Cambridge for Hanover to take over as the head of women’s rowing for Dartmouth.
For freshman Daniel Bridgewater of New Zealand, the message came shortly prior to boarding a plane headed for Boston.
“We were informed about two weeks before we arrived on campus that [Muri] would no longer be the freshman coach,” Bridgewater said. “I’m not too sure exactly how I reacted—it was a bit of a surprise...though I could understand her reasoning.”
When lightweight coach Michael Bartman picked up Bridgewater at the airport, Bartman explained that it was still uncertain who would take the role of coach of the first years. Bartman had assumed the head coaching position just one year earlier, and here he was without a clear freshman coach to begin his sophomore campaign.
And yet, just over a month later, the storied Crimson rowing program had found its answer from within by officially naming volunteer assistant coach Ian Accomando as the full-time assistant charged with overseeing the freshman lightweights.
Even the new coach was caught a little off guard by the sudden shift, but Accomando has adjusted on the fly.
“It’s been a good year so far,” Accomando said. “It was a bit of a surprise that the opportunity opened up…. I was the intern for the last two years, so it wasn’t too crazy as far as the coaching [change] went.”
Circumstances, which brought former Big Green captain Accomando to Harvard and sent former Crimson coach Muri to Dartmouth, have a way of working themselves out in the end.
SEVERED CONNECTION, UNCERTAIN BEGINNING
Though the change was swift and the goodbyes brief, Muri’s departure after her 13th year with Harvard underscored her importance to the team, both on the coaching and the recruiting sides. On both fronts, the former MIT rower had left her mark.
“I have a strong personal connection with so many of [my rowers], and to leave that, that’s really hard,” said Muri in an interview last month. “It’s harder to stay in touch in that same way without the connection of being at Harvard anymore.”
Now sophomores, members of the last group of freshmen Muri mentored point to her leadership as one of the main drivers of their success. Less than a year ago, the Muri-guided lightweight fours took silver at the IRA National Championships, and yet just a few months after the school year wrapped up, their coach was gone.
It quickly became clear how many Crimson rowers Muri had influenced over the years. Sophomore coxswain James Dreben is one of them. Beyond the impact of one’s average coach, he stated that Muri had a presence that was immediately felt from day one and could inspire.
“One of the main reasons I wanted to do crew here was Coach Muri, just because she is such a great personality and coach,” Dreben said. “It’s definitely a loss to the program to see her go.”
Even with Muri gone, her shadow is still present with the newest class of recruited rowers. Many had spoken with the now-Dartmouth coach at some point during the recruiting process. For some recruits, Muri had been the initial reason they came to Harvard.
Among her many roles, Muri served as the recruiting point person for the team, reaching out to potential candidates such as current-freshmen James Dupuis and Bridgewater long before they ever stepped on campus.
“[Muri] was really the coach that I was recruited [by],” Bridgewater said. “I started talking with her about two years ago, sent emails, and then I had my official visits in 2013.”
As the newest additions to the Harvard rowing family unpacked their bags and completed their training regimens upon arriving on campus, there lingered an air of uncertainty. It was August, the trademark Head of the Charles event was only two months away, and there was no freshman coach.
Not to mention that dozens of potential walk-ons, many of whom had never pulled an oar before, needed to be tutored before the season picked up.
Needless to say, there was some urgency surrounding the freshmen that hadn’t been seen in years after over a decade of stability under Muri.
CALMER WATERS
With the sudden coaching changes at the top, there existed an inevitable apprehension regarding the start of the season. But those fears were also balanced by limited optimism and trust in the system.
“At first, I was a little anxious because for about three weeks we didn’t know who our coach was,” Dupuis said. “But I took comfort in that the Harvard athletic department would pick a very qualified coach who could fill the position.”
Though the first few weeks of the season saw Bartman delegate some of the freshman-related responsibilities to Accomando, the head coach delayed officially naming someone to the position for a short time as Accomando learned the ropes of the job. However, the former Dartmouth standout had established himself as a worthy assistant coach through his two years of volunteering and had also met some of the recruited freshmen previously.
“I actually knew [Accomando] before from when I visited the campus during my official visit and unofficial visits as well,” Dupuis said. “From first impression, he seemed like a young, relatable guy and as it turns out, he really does know his stuff.”
Since his appointment to the post, Accomando has done little but impress his freshmen rowers and instill in them the knowledge that he had gained through his own collegiate experience.
Though the newly-appointed Accomando may not have the coaching pedigree yet, he’s displayed the confidence necessary for the job.
“Rowing is rowing, and so I feel like I know what I’m talking about,” Accomando said. “I don’t have the gravitas that Linda had, but I think I can connect with the guys pretty well. It’s been a good transition—[the freshmen] are good learners, and they’ve made it easier for me by just showing up with the right mentality every day.”
Looking back less than a month and a half ago, the coaching situation seems considerably more secure now than before, with Accomando taking the opportunity in stride and with confidence.
“The reality has really exceeded expectations,” Dupuis said. “At first, I didn’t really know what they were...if anything, I didn’t know what to expect. But then the first day, Accomando grabbed hold of the reins and drove us into the right direction.”
STUDENT-TEACHER ASSISTANCE
Part of Accomando’s appeal has been his relative youth. Just a few years before, the assistant coach could be seen wearing Dartmouth green on the water, competing and even beating the team he has now embraced as his own.
As opposed to letting his lack of coaching experience define his performance, Accomando has made a point of leveraging his relatively recent competition experience to his advantage.
“I think [my recent  Dartmouth rowing career] helps me connect with the crew, and not just the freshmen, but all the underclassmen on the team,” Accomando said. “But it works both ways—I know when they’re trying to sneak one by, and I know when I need to back off and give them a little space.”
Though Accomando discussed the major improvements his Dartmouth squad made in his four years on the team, he stayed away from highlighting individual performances, which included two second-team All-Ivy accolades and a silver medal at the 2012 IRA National Championships.As a result, the newest permanent member of the Crimson coaching staff is just a few years removed from having competed in many of the same events in which his athletes will row in just a few weeks.
And while personability and poise under the watchful gaze of the newest Harvard students has been key in the first month and a half of the season, Accomando’s recent experiences rowing in big races has given him instant credibility.
“A lot of the workouts that he plans, he’s also pulled before,” Dupuis said. “He really knows all the events [and] how the competition works—he’s done all these races before and done extremely well at them...as captain of Dartmouth crew.”
Thus far, the success of the hire has been seen through the positive affirmation from the rowers, many of whom originally pledged to join the team because of Muri’s work but now find themselves in a transition period of sorts. And though their expectations may have changed upon their initial arrival at Harvard, the new reality has shown itself to be good in its own fashion as well.
“I couldn’t be happier [where I am],” Dupuis said. “Accomando really excited me for the entire rowing scene and has such an ability to make things relatable. He makes practices fun to go to and makes us always excited to row under his wing.”
As the the season inches closer to the major competitions of the fall, supporters of Harvard crew can be assured that the tutelage of the freshmen rowers is in able hands for the near future.
Looking ahead, Accomando also expressed the desire to remain with Harvard, stating that he “wanted to earn his position” at the school.
Bartman also voiced his support for his assistant, commending Accomando for his work thus far this season.
“Everything is going well and the transition of Ian Accomando into the assistant position has been very smooth,” said Bartman in an emailed statement earlier in the month. “He was already the volunteer coach for the past two years, so he is very familiar with the program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a seven-game winning streak, the Harvard men’s soccer team took a break from its conference schedule to welcome Holy Cross to Soldiers Field Wednesday night.
In a contest where 23 different members of the Crimson took the field, Harvard (8-3-0, 2-0-0 Ivy) utilized a trio of second half-goals to keep that streak alive, cruising to a 3-0 victory.
“There’s been some guys that haven’t gotten a ton of minutes so far this season, and they stepped in tonight to play a lot of minutes and did extremely well out there,” said associate head coach Jonathan Delano. “When you have every player fighting for time on the field, it only makes the whole team better.”
Nonetheless, even in a game where Harvard’s depth was the center of attention, it was a pair of regulars who sealed the win for the Crimson.
After most of the Harvard starters appeared to be done for the day following early substitutions, head coach Pieter Lehrer and the coaching staff elected to go back to their first eleven at halftime.
And less than two minutes into the second frame, their decision paid off. Initiating the attack, sophomore midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu eluded a defender along the left side of the pitch before sending a cross to the far post.
On the receiving end, junior midfielder Matt Sheeleigh lunged at the ball, causing it to bounce in the direction of junior forward Oliver White, who directed it past the keeper to put the Crimson on top.
“The players came up with [the decision],” Delano said. “They said to us that we needed a spark—that there needed to be more energy out there on the field from the first minute to the 45th minute. We wanted to put that spark into the game, so we decided to do it going into the second half.”
The choice continued to pay dividends later on, as Harvard added an insurance goal in the 56th minute courtesy of junior midfielder Tim Schmoll.
Just as he had done a few minutes prior, Wheeler-Omiunu got the attack started, this time finding junior midfielder Andrew Chang sprinting up the left wing. All alone, Chang entered the box, drawing the keeper towards the near post.
Seeing this, Chang lofted a cross through the box to an unmarked Schmoll, who headed the ball into the virtually empty net for his second goal of the season.
“I wanted a goal for a while,” Schmoll said. “The chances have been there, and that’s all credit to the guys on the wings crossing the ball in…. Chang got me into the easiest position possible to score. That wasn’t my goal; that was everyone else’s.
On the other end of the pitch, the Crimson back line held the Crusaders (5-5-2, 2-2-0 Patriot) to just two shots on goal, en route to its third consecutive clean sheet. With junior co-captain Mark Ashby playing limited minutes, senior Tyler Evans was in control, playing alongside some unfamiliar faces, including forward Tyler Savitsky.
“We have a lot of athleticism across the back line,” Delano said. “We have the flexibility to play quite a few players across that back line. I think it just speaks to how strong the group is that we can plug different players in, and we don’t miss a beat.”
Coming off the bench for the first time this season, junior defender Phil Fleischman tacked on a third goal in the 72nd minute. Following a defensive play by freshman defender Eric Gylling to save a goal, freshman midfielder Nate Devine launched a counter attack that resulted in the junior converting from 18 yards out. Crimson goalies Joe Festa and Evan Mendez held Holy Cross scoreless for the squad’s third shutout of the season.
“I think everyone is ready to step up at any moment,” Schmoll said. “A starter one day can sit on the bench the next day, and vice versa. Everyone has the utmost confidence in the guy that’s next to him on the field and the guy that’s next to him on the bench.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the fall of 1980, the Harvard and MIT men’s water polo teams have faced off on 102 occasions, with the Crimson claiming victory in 81 of those matches. Wednesday night was nothing out of the ordinary, as Harvard defeated the Engineers, 12-10, at MIT’s Alumni Pool in East Cambridge, Mass.
In a close matchup between the cross-town rivals, the Crimson (14-5, 4-3 CWPA) and the Engineers (8-10, 3-3) were tied with nine goals apiece going into the fourth period. Led by strong closing performances from junior 2-meter Ben Zepfel and sophomore 2-meter defender Dan Stevens, Harvard outscored MIT three to one in the final period. Stevens’ late goal, with 33 seconds left in the contest, secured the victory for the Crimson.
Coming off of a successful weekend during which the Engineers defeated No. 13 Brown and Connecticut College for a clean record within CWPA Northern play, MIT was looking to continue its three-game win streak and gain momentum going into the home stretch of the season, but Harvard was not going to let that happen.
Crimson junior goalie Colin Woolway emphasized the importance of defensive play for Harvard in the second half of the game against a strong Engineers team, allowing just three goals compared to the seven given up in the first half of play. Last weekend, the Crimson struggled on defense, giving up 34 goals over two games, but this weekend the team had much better success keeping the ball out of the net.
“We decided at half-time to really buckle down,” Woolway said. “After the third quarter, we decided to ramp [our defense] up even further and that allowed us to get the win.”
Other key contributors for the Harvard side include freshman utility Colin Chiapello and sophomore attacker Joey Colton, who each scored two goals. Junior attacker Blake Lee also added three goals in the game.
Harvard coach Ted Minnis made it clear that limiting penalties and solid teamwork gave his team a major advantage against MIT. The Engineers suffered five ejections compared to the Crimson’s two, giving Harvard several chances to score with extra players in the pool.
“We minimized our ejections and didn’t allow them to play 6 on 5, which is something they are very good at,” Minnis said. “ It was just a good team effort. When we needed goals we got goals. I thought we played really solid all the way around.”
With this win, the Crimson has won eight of its last 10 games, including a major upset against No. 16 Whittier to end its California swing with a perfect 5-0 record. The team has been anchored by an especially strong and experienced offense.
“We’ve realized that we have a good enough offensive team where we can have a slightly off day,” Woolway said. “But as long as we’re playing up to our potential defensively, we can play with and compete with anyone in the country.”
This coming weekend, Harvard will enter as the third-ranked seed in the 2014 Ivy League Water Polo Championship. Brown and Princeton have dominated play in the Ancient Eight in recent years. Between the two squads, the Bears and the Tigers have won all of the Ivy League Water Polo Championships since the event began in 2010.
Minnis discussed his excitement for this weekend’s event, noting that although most of the games will not count towards their conference schedule, the Ivy League competition is an exciting opportunity for the team to face Ancient Eight foes the team doesn’t typically get to face in the regular season.
“Whenever you get to play in an Ivy League Championship, that’s what’s exciting. That’s what everyone on campus loves,” Minnis said. “Yeah, that’s great that we beat MIT but when we beat Brown, or when we beat Princeton, or when we beat Yale, then everybody else is going to be a little more excited about [men’s water polo].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball 2014-2015 season will, fittingly, kick off with a shooting contest. The Crimson has historically been one of the nation’s best long-range shooting teams, ranking seventh in the nation in 2012-2013, when it stunned the New Mexico Lobos in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, and 39th last year.
The contest features one member of each class: sophomore Corbin Miller, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, freshman Andre Chatfield, and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi. Each member brings something different to the table. In a contest that has historically deviated from the script at the NBA level—Jason Kapono and Daequan Cook have three times as many combined wins as Ray Allen and Reggie Miller—anyone can win. With that in mind, here is a quick preview of each candidate.
CORBIN MILLER
The contest will represent Miller’s first court appearance for the Crimson since the then-freshman left after the 2011-2012 season for his Mormon mission. As a freshman, Miller was basically Steve Novak—lights-out from long range and shooting little else. The Utah native shot threes on nearly 75 percent of all his attempts, sinking a cool 45.6 percent. Much like departed senior and last year’s winner Laurent Rivard ’14—who roughly shot a mind-boggling seven threes for every two-pointer he attempted last year—Miller will be an important floor spacer for the offense this year.
SIYANI CHAMBERS
Chambers is the most interesting candidate in the contest. The two-time All-Ivy point guard has started since his freshman year and, following the departure of Brandyn Curry ’13-’14, he and returning Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders will be forced to shoulder the ball-handling duties for the offense. This means Chambers will play less off the ball, where he is very effective as a shot-up shooter.
The junior is also a high-variance shooter. Chambers made four or more threes in four separate games last year—including a stretch where he made 14 of 21 treys—but also started the year by making only four of his first 21 bombs. In this contest, where second is last, a high-variance strategy might not be such a bad thing.
STEVE MOUNDOU-MISSI
Talk about a sparse track record. Moundou-Missi, Harvard’s best rebounder and offensive finisher around the rim, took one three all of last year, against Brown with the shot clock running down. The senior forward has a feathery jump shot from 15 feet out and if he can extend his range out a couple feet, then he will be a factor here.
ANDRE CHATFIELD
Although only the seniors on campus have seen Miller play for Harvard, Chatfield is the big unknown heading into the contest. The 6’4” guard from Lilburn, Georgia was a highly regarded recruit when he committed to Harvard—along with fellow freshman Chris Egi—last fall. Luckily, there are some highlight tapes of the guard online—one of which features Chatfield draining three after three in an empty gym. Although there is obvious selection bias in there—Chatfield doesn’t miss a shot the entire way—one notes that Chatfield has what his teammates call ‘nerd swag.’ Sounds like a winner to me.

It’s a little over a month into a new school year, and if you’re new to House life, you’re just getting acquainted with the tutors who live in your entryways. If you're lucky, they'll come in adorable pairs that will make you question the value of #hookup culture.
Case in point: meet Ian B. Seiple and Michaela P. Danek, or the Will and Kate of Lowell House O entryway.
He's just a boy, she's just a girl, but actually, he’s a post-doc in Chemistry currently working on antibiotics and she’s a high school teacher with a master’s degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. They met competing together on a triathlon team when Michaela was at the University of California, San Diego and Ian was studying next door at the Scripps Research Institute. Can you say power couple?
Ian has been a tutor in Lowell for two years, but Michaela applied a year later after living separately to complete her master’s program. With regards to their dual partnership, Ian says, “It wasn’t part of any plan. We didn’t think about it until partway through when she started spending a lot of time here and really enjoying the House system.”
But despite how cute they are together, Ian and Michaela say that they do a lot separately in the House. Michaela says that students are more comfortable meeting with each of them separately because otherwise they feel like they would be intruding on a date if they’re together. Third wheelin' so hard.

Good morning, Harvard! It’s Thursday, which means it’s that day we all want to be over with already so we can get to the weekend (unless you’re that person everyone envies because you don’t have Friday classes). To help pass the time away, here are some things that happened this week that you might have missed:
1) First Lady Michelle Obama Danced to Turn Down for What: An Obama impersonator on Vine asked the first lady how many calories she burns every time she “turns up,” and she responded with a pun about turnips #classy
2) Beyoncé, Jay Z, and Mona Lisa took a pic: This past weekend, Beyoncé and her fam got a private tour of the Louvre and then the couple posted a picture of them standing really close to the Mona Lisa. Let the social media craziness begin.
3) Yogurt becomes New York’s official state snack: Governor Andrew Cuomo officially released this statement yesterday morning. Where’s the love for the lactose intolerant?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It’s going to be a high of 71 degrees today but there’s a 100% chance of rain, in fact there will probably be thunderstorms. Two days of good weather were too good to be true, but nonetheless, don’t forget to pack that umbrella before you leave!

2) Law School Profs Condemn New Sexual Harassment Policy: “Twenty-eight Law School professors called for Harvard to withdraw its newly installed sexual harassment policy in a pointed open letter published on Tuesday night.”
3) Faculty Seek To Push Back Against Benefits Changes: “Several members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences said they are weighing options for how best to push back against a new set of University health benefits plans they call “regressive,” even as a University spokesperson said Tuesday that the University does not plan to alter the policy for 2015.”

PHOTO OF THE DAY
Mt. Trashmore, a towering mountain made of all of Harvard Yard's Tuesday trash, appeared Wednesday outside Annenberg Memorial Hall. The Resource Efficiency Program (REP) created this mountain and the numerous signs around it to draw attention to how much we throw away every day; to encourage recycling; and to give passersby tips about sustainability.
