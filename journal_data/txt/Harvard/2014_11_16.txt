After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Penn.— The last time that the Harvard football team came to Franklin Field, Penn upset the Crimson to clinch a share of the Ivy title, which it would eventually win outright.
This year’s Quakers team entered Saturday’s contest with just one win—over Ivy League bottom-feeder Columbia—and was tabbed as having an even longer shot of beating Harvard. But playing for 23-year coach Al Bagnoli in his final home game, Penn almost found enough to upset Harvard. Almost.
Penn (1-8, 1-5 Ivy) didn’t make it easy for the Crimson (9-0, 6-0) on Saturday, but junior running back Paul Stanton came through time and time again for the visitors, and Harvard left Franklin Field with a 34-24 win.
The victory secured at least a share of the eighth Ivy League title for coach Tim Murphy’s squad in the last 20 years, and a win over Yale next weekend at Harvard Stadium would give the Crimson the outright title.
“To say that Penn gave us all we could handle is an understatement,” Murphy said. “We’re lucky to get out of here alive…. It’s a tremendous compliment to [Bagnoli’s] leadership and what he’s done for this program. They played like an outstanding football team today.... Today they played like a team that expected to win.”
As the Crimson struggled to get anything going offensively in the third quarter—failing to get a single first down until the final 90 seconds of the quarter—Penn made the top-ranked secondary of the league look downright ordinary.
Quakers quarterback Alek Torgersen burned the Crimson all day with his dual-threat ability, recording 39 rushing yards on top of his 211 passing yards, as well as a touchdown on the ground and through the air. Torgersen moved the squad efficiently down the field on Penn’s opening drive of the half, finding wide receiver Mitchell King wide open in the end zone to knot the score at 17-all.
Botched snaps on the next drive forced another three-and-out for the Crimson, and senior punter David Bicknell kicked it away from the back of the end zone. The Quakers got the ball at Harvard’s 38 and capitalized on the opportunity, as Torgersen capped off the drive with his own four-yard scoring run to put Penn up for the second time of the day, 24-17.
“That’s where you really find out what kind of football team you have,” Murphy said. “We had every opportunity to fold today. And it wasn’t coaching. It wasn’t anything other than our kids’ will to just somehow get this thing into the win column.”
Then, 12 minutes from watching a title opportunity slip away yet again, the Crimson came to life on both sides of the ball. The defense blocked a Penn field goal—its second deflected kick on the day—and kicker Andrew Flesher tacked on a field goal of his own. It was Torgersen’s turn to fumble the snap, and this led to a Penn three-and-out.
The Crimson’s offense finally clicked when it needed to. Junior quarterback Scott Hosch found Stanton on a screen that turned into a 19-yard gain, and then senior receiver Ty Hamblin took a couple of Penn defenders with him into the end zone to take the advantage back for good, 27-24.
A shanked punt gave Harvard the ball in Penn territory, and Stanton padded the lead, gaining 34 rushing yards on the drive en route to barreling into the end zone. His third score of the day, the touchdown gave the Crimson the decisive 34-24 lead.
“We’re used to adversity. We knew it would be a tough game going in,” Stanton said. “We just knew we had the ability to finish. We just had to go out there and play the play.”
Stanton ended the day with 235 yards on the ground, as well as 41 receiving, surpassing his previous career rushing high of 180 yards.
On Penn’s opening drive of the game, the Crimson deflected Hunter Kelley’s punt to start its first possession in Quakers territory, and it took just 12 seconds for Harvard to get on the board—Stanton took the handoff and sprinted 42 yards down the field to give the Crimson the early 7-0 lead.
Stanton, as he did all day, picked up the slack when the rest of the offense sputtered. The second scoring drive was nearly as short, as the Crimson took just 32 seconds to tack on its second touchdown on a 75-yard run by the back, giving the visitors a 14-10 lead. A field goal late in the second quarter by kicker Andrew Flesher made the lead 17-10 going into the break.
Senior quarterback Conner Hempel, who hasn’t seen game time since Dartmouth, when he injured his shoulder, didn’t dress for the game. Under center instead for Harvard was Hosch. The starting position is a familiar place now for Hosch, as Hempel was sidelined early in the season with a back injury, but the junior appeared rattled early on Saturday.
Hosch’s fourth pass of the game, intended for junior tight end Ben Braunecker, was batted up in the air by a Penn cornerback and picked off Quakers defensive end Jack Madden. Harvard’s next possession also ended in a Hosch interception, when cornerback Ian Dobbins jumped the receiver’s route for the pick—which was stopped from being a pick six by Hosch himself, who made the tackle.
Penn was only able to convert the first takeaway into points, when backup quarterback Adam Strouss faked a quarterback run at the goal line and lobbed the ball over the pile to receiver Ryan O’Malley. The score gave the Quakers the early lead, 10-7, as a failed Crimson onside kick had led to a field goal on Penn’s previous possession. Harvard previously hadn’t trailed since its week two contest against Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2012, the then-undefeated Harvard men’s ice hockey team welcomed Yale to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for an early November matchup, only to be run off the ice in a convincing 5-1 defeat.
On Saturday night, the Crimson found itself in the same position, heading into its first of three contests against the Bulldogs (3-1-2, 2-1-1 ECAC) unbeaten through five games. And given a second chance, Harvard this time proved the validity of its record, playing Yale even for 46 minutes.
The Bulldogs, however, would eventually be the side to break the tie, as junior defenseman Ryan Obuchowski lit the lamp 6:48 into the final frame, lifting Yale past the Crimson (3-1-2, 2-1-2 ECAC) in a 2-1 victory.
“I’m happy with the effort,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “There’s certainly things we can improve on, and as a team that really wants to improve moving forward, it’s a good learning experience for us to be in a tight, close game against a very smart, strong team.”
Bulldogs’ forward Mike Doherty began the attack to put his side ahead, carrying the puck over the blue line along the right wing. The sophomore then shifted his stride toward the center of the ice and dropped the puck off for Obuchowski at the top of the right circle.
With thirty feet between him and the closest Crimson defenseman, Obuchowski elected to move toward the boards rather than crash the net, and his decision paid off. From the difficult angle, the junior ripped a wrist shot that deflected off a Harvard stick, skipping over the left shoulder of Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek to put Yale ahead, 1-0.
That is how the score would remain until the final minute of play. After the Crimson pulled Michalek in favor of an extra attacker, Doherty took advantage of a misplayed puck on the Harvard blueline and netted an empty net goal with just 55 seconds remaining.
Riding the momentum of back-to-back six-goal outbursts, the Crimson came out strong in the first period, outskating Yale in the opening minutes. But Harvard just could not find a way to solve Bulldogs’ goaltender Alex Lyon.
“I thought [in] the first period we played well,” Donato said. “I thought there were probably eight to 10 minutes there where [we] were having men control the puck down low. [But Lyon] made some big saves.”
The sophomore netminder’s biggest stop of the game came midway through the second period.
Sophomore forward Tyler Moy flipped the puck up the left boards to elude a Yale attacker, giving him the entire wing to work with. Darting his way through the left circle, the sophomore delivered a pass on the ensuing 2-on-1 to freshman forward Jake Horton.
The rookie ripped a shot on his first touch of the puck, but Lyon, sprawling to his left, was there to deny Horton his first collegiate goal. The goaltender notched 33 saves in all, earning him the inaugural Tim Taylor Cup for the most valuable player of the Harvard-Yale matchup played in Cambridge.
“[Lyon] is an excellent goaltender,” Donato said. “He was positionally sound, and he didn’t scramble at all…. I think we could have maybe got some more pucks to the net, [but] sometimes excellent goalies…actually cause you to shoot less because you don’t want to waste opportunities.”
The Crimson finally broke through with 16 seconds remaining in the contest, when junior forward Jimmy Vesey poked a loose puck past Lyon from inside the crease to cut the deficit in half.
Harvard had a chance to equalize just moments later after a Yale delay of game penalty gave the team a faceoff in the attacking zone, but the Crimson could not muster a shot on goal in the game’s final seconds.
Michalek stopped 33 of the 34 shots that came his way in the game, matching his total against Brown in a win on Friday. The junior holds a .941 save percentage—the second best mark in the ECAC.
Despite Michalek’s efforts, Harvard has now dropped six of its last seven contests against the Bulldogs.
“Any loss to Yale is obviously tough to swallow,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever beaten Yale so far, so [this] is just adding to a bad taste in my mouth against those guys. I can’t wait to play them again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—With 10.9 seconds left in the game, the ball was right where coach Tommy Amaker wanted it. It was in senior wing Wesley Saunders’s hands, with Harvard down one to local foe Holy Cross. Saunders had done it all for his team on Sunday night, totaling 24 points and grabbing rebounds, recording blocks, and nabbing steals whenever the Crimson needed it.
But, seemingly for the first time all evening, Saunders looked fallible. After bringing the rock down the court via the right sideline, he made his way into the paint, and was forced to throw up a contested jumper. As the game clock wound down, the ball hit the heel of the rim and bounced away from the cylinder.
Ticks later, the whistle blew and the score was official. The No. 25 Harvard men’s basketball team showed weaknesses weeks before it was supposed to be truly challenged, losing, 58-57, to the Crusaders (1-0) Sunday night at TD Garden.
“To have it in [Saunders’s] hands to make a play is all we could’ve asked for,” Amaker said.  “[Holy Cross] played a tremendous basketball game with the grittiness that they showed, and I thought towards the end that they deserved the victory.”
The final score was reflective of the back-and-forth nature of the matchup, one in which Harvard (1-1) was seemingly continuously fighting from behind, gaining a slim lead, and then losing its advantage once more. While Saunders was able to bring his team back countless times throughout the night, Holy Cross’s final one-point lead proved insurmountable.
After Harvard fell behind, 8-0, in the opening minutes, then climbed back into contention and took a slim 28-27 lead going into intermission, a Holy Cross run to begin the second half put the Crimson on its heels once more. Two jumpers from junior wing Eric Green, a three-point play and a free-throw line dagger from senior guard Justin Burrell, and a surfeit of Harvard turnovers led the Crusaders on a quick 9-0 run right out of the break.
At the 16:54 mark of the second half, Harvard found itself right back where it started the game, in an eight-point hole, 36-28, with a lot of basketball left to be played.
And then Saunders woke up. After Burrell hit that free-throw line jumper, Saunders put the ball on the floor and penetrated, drawing the foul. Six-point game. Next, Saunders somehow managed to bank in a contested floater in the paint. Five-point game. Minutes later, Saunders received the ball on the left wing and sliced his way into the paint. He elevated after reaching the box, drawing contact in the air, and tossing in the lefty layup. Following the and-one free throw, Harvard was within one.
After Holy Cross began to show signs of life once more, Saunders passed the offensive baton to co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi. With 3:48 to go, Moundou-Missi caught the ball in the corner, dribbled twice, spun baseline, and converted the layup. Next, he ran down the length of the court to block Holy Cross senior Malcolm Miller before sprinting back the other way for a two-handed, emphatic slam that extended the Crimson’s lead to four.
But just as had been true all night, Holy Cross had an answer to Harvard’s run.
Burrell responded to Moundou-Missi’s inside game by taking it to the paint himself, connecting on a short jumper. Harvard up, 55-53. Then, two consecutive Crimson turnovers gave the ball back to the Crusaders, who sunk three straight free throws to take the one-point advantage.
With 1:54 to play, miscommunication between the Harvard backcourt players led a trapped Chambers to throw a long pass to Saunders, right as the latter was running in the opposite direction. Holy Cross capitalized on the mistake, knocking down another pair from the charity stripe to give it a three-point lead with 1:02 remaining.
Chambers, however, made up for the mistake on the next play, finding Mondou-Missi on the back-end of a pick-and-roll. The forward flew in from the right-side second hash mark, dunking the ball and cutting the Crimson’s deficit to one.
But, 30 seconds later, when Saunders started his trip up court with 10 ticks left in the game, there was finally nothing left in the tank for one more comeback. After playing every second of the contest, Saunders could not get his game-winning attempt to fall at the buzzer, and the Holy Cross upset was complete.
For Harvard, the loss came down to what Amaker called an “inability to handle [the Crusaders’] pressure,” with the coach citing the Crimson’s 24 turnovers, a total that more than doubled the Crusaders’s mark of 11, as the key difference in the game.
“It is hard to think that you are going to be able to win, let alone have a chance to win, with that many turnovers,” Amaker said.
To go along with his 24 points, Saunders also tallied 12 rebounds, four steals, three blocks, and three assists. Up until the 3:22 mark of the first half, Saunders had a hand in every basket that Harvard scored, either by sinking the shot himself or handing off the dime that led to the score.
Ultimately, however, Holy Cross’s collective effort overmatched the mammoth performance of Saunders, and the Crimson faced both the first loss of its season and the likely scenario of being bumped from the AP’s Top 25.
“It meant a lot to [Holy Cross] and they played like it meant a lot to them,” Saunders said. “We have to get used to that…. We are going to still have a target on our back every night and we are going to have to go out there and battle our hearts out every night.”

You may not have even known they existed, or maybe you assumed you had never met them because they just lived in the Union Dorms last year, but each year, Harvard admits twelve transfer students into the college and sticks them into some of the upperclassmen houses.
Who would want to re-hash the freshman horrors of “Is the Quad part of MIT” and “Where is Northwest Labs”? Flyby decided to sit down with some of these socially savvy transplants to pick their brains.
“It can be very hard, especially here, said Eddie J. Love ’15, who transferred to Harvard after completing two years at the Air Force Academy. “Blocking groups…happen in your freshman year. You kind of pick the group you want to be with for the rest of your time, as a freshman.”
Ana Carell ’17, said that being a transfer student forces you to become socially competent. “You guys have so many acronyms. It’s ridiculous!” Carrell said after being here for nearly two months.
Transfers get an orientation, a t-shirt, a T-PAF (which sounds more like biological jargon than a transfer peer advisor), and a bunch of other people who will ask if everything’s A-okay. But, the adjustment varies for each person. “There are certain things that administration can’t do, like creating the relationships,” said Moriya Blumenfeld ’16.
Without that grace period of ice-cream coerced icebreakers, integrating into Harvard was “kind of traumatic.” Usually, transfer students are coupled and plopped into one of the upperclassman houses. In a cataclysmic collision of all things horrible, Blumenfeld was put into Winthrop, alone.
Meep…Be my friend? But transfers don’t end up alone forever:
Blumenfeld “pulled an Annenberg” and sat next to some strangers in the Throp D-hall who turned into her best friends. She was even adopted into a blocking group! Lance B. Katigbak ’16 who transferred in as a second semester sophomore last fall from the University of the Philippines found his family amongst HPAIR, and he even started his own organization on campus. Love is now captain of the rugby team and found such great friends that he transferred from Dunster to the Quad to live with them his senior year.
Somehow, it just all seems to sort out, to a point at which you would never know the transfers had started their undergraduate stories elsewhere.
So, if they had to do it all again, would they avoid the stress and just come directly here?
Some transfers say they wouldn’t change a thing. Coming from the Air Force Academy, Love had the opportunity to travel to England and go skydiving—granted he was occasionally sent into the wilderness and given the instruction: survive. He remarked, “Having that personal discipline and that ability to structure for myself allowed me to take advantage of all the freedom [at Harvard] and use it in a good way."
